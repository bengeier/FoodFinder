{"text":"Our waitress and the burgers were great! Started with the spicy wings that were spicy but sooooo tasty. Buttons and bleu burger was delicious and the fries were a mix of regular and sweet potato all in. One yummy mound. They even included an onion ring on the top. Perfection! Give this place a try."}
{"text":"What a brilliant place!!! Food great, service even better and the atmosphere , well you just have to go there yourself and experience the place.   Awesome everyone!!! I'll be back tomorrow night!!!"}
{"text":"One time I did dine at Wally's A s'mac it was great with much cheese I look left I look right It's been a great night Their staff is chalk full of hotties."}
{"text":"My wife over heard someone at the gym today about this place and she literally dragged me there.  I was totally blown away with the service, food and environment.  'Baggers N Mash' was excellent, fresh mash potatoes with some lovely sausages in a tasty brown sauce of onions and mushrooms. Wonderful.  Fish and Chips, just got a bite, but excellent with light breading and fresh fish, french fried white and sweet potato fries very tasty.  Dessert to die for, chocolate fudge cake.  The serving size was about a quarter of the entire cake, that my wife and I had a serving there and also a nice snack with our afternoon tea.  Strongly recommend.  Found the price no more expensive than any other for a good meal, the serving size is in line with price.  Will return, this time she won't have to drag me for sure.  A very lovely place."}
{"text":"Much better experience this visit. Food was excellent and service exceeded expectations! I had the hummus with carrots and celery and my wife had Matty's Beef Stroganoff and we loved them both! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have been dining at Wally's for the past several years.   Wally's has great food and drink served by super friendly people in a family friendly enviroment.  The prices are also very reasonable.    Wally's is the Best  casual dining experience in the Valley.    You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu but for lunch I recommend the smoked turkey sandwich or fish and chips.  For those of you that like burgers, the Wally burger is great.    For dinner the chicken parmesan is outstanding.  I also really like their chicken marcello.  Wally just also opened a second location in Scottsdale.    If your lucky, you may even run into Wally."}
{"text":"The first time that I went into this place I thought that it was okay. I did not feel like it lived up to the rave reviews but it was good enough to bring me back to enjoy some food and drink with an old friend.  That time I had ordered their shrimp cocktail while I waited for my friend to arrive, I was starving! As I was eating, the owner (I assume) came up to introduce himself and asked if I live in the area (most of the patrons do)...as I turned back towards the bar to eat my very last jumbo shrimp, the Katie Perry look alike grabbed my food and dumped it in the trash! She never even asked if I was finished. I asked her if she decided that I was done eating and then she asked if I wanted another shrimp from the kitchen but I felt awkward at that point and told her no. She still brought me one lonely shrimp on a huge plate with no cocktail sauce. The sauce is what makes the shrimp cocktail. My friend and I then ordered their spinach dip.  The dip was brought out and as the plate was lowered to the bar, my chips were sliding off onto the bar and she just scooped them back on to the plate. I personally was not thrilled about that. I scooped some spinach up on to my dirty chip, blew on it a little and took a bite. This dip was the hottest (heat wise) thing that I have ever had in my mouth. I would compare it to biting the rack in a broiler.  I was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot. I guarantee the work of a microwave! I burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding. It took over a week of peroxide rinses, colloidal silver rinses and salt water rinses to heal my mouth. My mouth is actually scarred inside! This burned me so terribly that my teeth were sore, my jaw hurt and even my sinuses on that side of my mouth hurt. When I stopped in to tell the brunette bartender about my burn and I advised that they should warn people about how hot they make it, she replied with \"Well, don't scarf your food down, let it cool first.\" Totally rude, offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that. That same night that I burned my mouth, my friend was using their hot sauce to spice up her chip and the bartender came over and started twisting the lid back on without asking if she was done and my friend had to stop her from taking it away. She clearly has issues with letting people finish their meal. When it came to the bill she had to ask us how many drinks we had because she wasn't keeping track... It seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either. I think this place would be OK if it wasn't for this bartender. I did order a salad on a separate occasion (when I warned her about the hot dip) and that proved to be disappointing as well, way too much dressing and she kept giving me a hard time for not drinking during my work hour. Booooooo!!!"}
{"text":"Chose this place at the last minute based on. Yelp reviews. It did not disappoint. The restaurant is similar to a sports bar theme but you can sit either inside or out. We arrived a little late, so it wasn't very crowded. I ordered a cheddar burger \"rodeo style\" which means it had onion straws and BBQ sauce on it. It was cooked perfectly, was very juicy and delicious. My wife had the fish and chips which was also outstanding. Overall, the service was great, the food was very good and the price was reasonable. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  Beautiful patio view of little green belt area of shopping center. Just green grass and a few flowers. Why is this so hard to find in beautiful Phoenix?  Ok, food--everything is fantastic!!  Hamburger, spaghetti, salad, Rueben, brats, Spinach dip (best)....love it!  Prices reasonable. Portions perfect. Wonderful place for lunch or dinner!  ENJOY."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite neighborhood \"go-to\" restaurants.  I am surprised by some of the reviews of poor service....we have always been impressed by the service.  We are always greeted with a smile by Wally or his son.  We often have our young kids in tow, and have always felt they are just as welcome, even with Wally's being an \"upscale\" pub.  I especially enjoy sitting on their patio... it is one of the best in the area.    As for the food.... We've tried most of the items on the menu, and haven't been disappointed yet.  Even the kids' mac'n'cheese is to die for!!  My favorite is the chinese chicken salad.  Good variety on the menu with consistent quality of food."}
{"text":"Always have great service at Wally's and really enjoy the options they have on their menu.  It is usually fairly busy but never had to wait long. They have daily specials and I have often seen the owner, Wally, hanging out too. It is a great local spot."}
{"text":"Just outstanding food & service. Specializes in mainly classic dishes.  One of the best spots in the valley--compared to any other."}
{"text":"Went here on a work luncheon, not expecting to see a line out the door at 1:00pm on a Wednesday.  After being sat, and greeted by our server, I could see they had a great customer service protocol as we had our drinks within 2 minutes.  I followed suit with the others and ordered their wings \"Wally Style\" and onion rings.  Usually with appetizers, it takes something pretty special to make me happy, but the wings were fantastic!  Crispy, flavorful, only the drums, and sauce on the side.  The onion rings were so good also, that I brought my girlfriend back that Friday to try their other food.  We started with the escargot, and then I had the bangers n' mash, and she had the fish & chips.  The entire meal was phenomenal, and the service was perfect.  Couldn't recommend more.  My new guilty place to go when I have time to enjoy my lunch during the week."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for date night. Upon entering you're greeted immediately by the friendly and courteous staff.  You'll find that there's something on the menu for everyone. My personal favorite is the classic Cobb Salad. The ingredients are always fresh, and always consistent! A huge plus in my book :) Delicious comfort food, tasty drinks, and a great location. You can't go wrong with Wally's."}
{"text":"This review is about rude, rude Wally. First off, as my 80 year old mother and I were coming in slowly, he said \"hurry up, old lady.\"  The food was ok, frankly not one thing to talk about.  A $10 - $14 burgers and salad kind of joint.  My son ordered the halibut special. The bill for a plate with some rice, green beans, and a piece of halibut was $26.95!!!!! I told Wally I thought that was too expensive for a restaurant like his. His response was, \"I guess you haven't eaten in a restaurant lately.\" well, Wally, no way am I stepping back in yours."}
{"text":"So after an exhausting day the man and I decided we wanted to be waited on for dinner.  However we couldn't come up with a style of food we were hungry for.  Now, when this happens my boyfriend invariably reverts to his inexplicable love for TGI Fridays.  I don't really understand the infatuation.  Friday's is fine, I guess, but when there are so many other better options why bother?  Plus there isn't one remotely close to my house.  So i start rattling off other pub-ish type places in the area where he might have a similar (but better) experience.  We settled on Wally's.  I had been once before but this was his first time.  When we walked in, the host gave us our choice of seating and we decided on a high top near the bar.  As we settled into our seats and took a look around, we agreed that the ambiance and decor are homey and welcoming without being obnoxious.  In fact, it sort of looks like a low key Friday's.    Our waiter came by promptly and took drink orders.  Wally's has a decent beer selection and the bf thought they had a nice whiskey selection as well.  We noticed how good the calamari looked as it was delivered to a nearby table and ordered that to start.  As we waited for it to arrive, we concentrated on our figuring out our entree orders.  I ultimately went with the chicken quesadilla off the appetizer menu and the bf ordered the Frisco burger.  The server was accommodating and helpful, making suggestions and answering questions as needed.  He specifically mentioned that the chipotle mayo on the burger was fantastic.  When the calamari arrived, we dug in.  The calamari well well cooked, with crispy breading and tender meat.  The marinara it was served with though was underwhelming.  We sat for a minute wondering whether to send it back or just deal.  Then, my bf said, \"I wonder how that chipotle mayo would be with the calamari?\"  Genius.  We flagged down server and he agreed that the mayo sauce was great with the calamari.  In fact, it was a  vast improvement.  They should just serve both sauces with the calamari.  Or ditch the marinara altogether.    When our entrees arrived, bf was pleased with the mix of onion rings, fries and sweet potato fries served with the burger.The burger was cooked to order and similar to a patty melt.  My quesadilla, while not Mexican restaurant quality, was decent for the environment.  It was tasty and I appreciated the sides of sour cream, avocado and salsa it came with.    Our server was attentive throughout the meal and checked in on us occasionally.  He offered dessert, but we were too stuffed.  Overall, we had a great experience.  I enjoy Keegan's as a neighborhood pub spot, but I like Wally's better. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Don't pass this place up if your in the area. You will regret it."}
{"text":"I've been going to Wally's for a long time and spent quite a bit of money there.  It;s been OK for most part for several years.  But, I've got to tell you that it seems they really want to get you in and out as quickly as possible.  Even if they are not full, with plenty of tables open.  They do want to rush you.  trying to take your order for food when they have not even brought out the drinks you've ordered.  They need to keep their customer in mind and they are not doing do this.  At least not any more."}
{"text":"I love the food and atmosphere at Wallys - the Chicken Vesuvius is sooooo good."}
{"text":"We found this little gem while surfing the internet for french onion soup in the Phoenix, Az area.  The service was very quick and the soup was great.  I also ordered the four cheese mac n cheese, which came out in a skillet topped with breadcrumbs.  I think it was the creamiest, and definitely cheesiest mac n cheese I've ever had.  Asiago, mozzarella, parmesan and monteray jack cheeses created such a great dish. My husband had the California Cobb salad with chicken.  It was nothing special.   But why come to a pub for a salad?   Overall I was satisfied."}
{"text":"I've lived close to Wally's for a few years and have never been there until tonight. Shaun was the most amazing waiter and we, we'll I, couldn't decide. He told me to pick three and he would surprise me. My man ordered Bourbon Street Pasta, which was fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised with Chicken Vesuvius out of the the three, I could not decide on.  Excellent food, excellent service! Great place!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat. A little pricey for what you get. Nice location with a patio. Good place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Holy smacks!  The mac n chz dishes they have are off the hook. Everything an Irish pub should be. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is spectacular. Best american food in this city hands down. Staff is exceptional, friendly, everyone knows your name. Wally... he's kind of a grouch. But whatever. I think he's just getting old... and tired of it all. The bar is adorable, the patio is so cozy and quaint, and the laughter makes this place a joy to be in. Great place."}
{"text":"Omg best freaking macaroni in my life  please get the classic cheeseburger Smac!  This was my first time going here and it wasn't even planned but I'm damn sure glad we went!   We were seated right away walking thru the dining area seeing the bar and sat outside,  Our waitress was cool she put her input on what she thought was good     Overall great experience i loveeeeed the food!!!!"}
{"text":"I travel frequently for work and look for local, good restaurants to try as opposed to the big chain places.  I found this joint on Yelp and it looked good and was close to my hotel so I gave it a try.  I sat at the bar and was promptly greeted by Trish the friendly bartender.  She was vibrant and working hard, but took time to ask where I was from and to explain the menu with suggestions.  I decided on a cold beer while I mulled it over.  Then a guy walks in and sits down right beside me and starts chatting away.  He seemed like a regular here and a pretty cool guy.  I talked a little with him and asked him for his menu suggestions and come to find out, this guy was the \"Wally\" that owned the place. What a great character this guy was.  Anyhow, after another beer or two, I took their suggestion and ordered the day's Blue-Plate Special which was a Fried Chicken dinner for Monday's.  I was skeptical of ordering fried chicken when I was looking for something exciting, but based on the recommendations, I gave it a try. It was superb, crispy boneless breasts served with a salad, mashed potatoes, and a white-chocolate bread pudding desert.  All so tasty.  A little more chat with Wally and I found out he's a frequent traveler to Key West, FL (Another of my favorite places).  He goes down there every year for the Hemingway Days festival where he's a past winner of the Ernest Hemingway look-alike contest.  I will say, they didn't miss with this guy."}
{"text":"This was a delightful experience.  I was lucky enough to visit on Tater Tot Tuesday (my favorite) so the sides generally defaulted to taters which arrived on my girlfriends plate. Of course I stole hers. I had wings that were okay. So glad they weren't baked!  I read about Wally's in the Arcadia Times and thought I'd spend some money there (I support local business). I'm so glad Liz was our server - she wore a 'great' smile, was very attentive and she is just as lovely on the outside as she seemingly is inwardly. I might come back one day."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Best pasta 'n' cheese I've had in some time is their Gruyere 'n' slab bacon. For a treat, ask for it over fries or mashed potatoes (instead of pasta). To quote Jon Stewart, \"Faaaaaaa-bulouuuuuus!\"  Also, very clean bathroom is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great service, nice menu, but don't order the pannini' s,  they  are just a sandwich."}
{"text":"I really hate to give a terrible review to Wally's, but there is one area in which I draw the line; and that is when an owner/manager is disrespectful.  Our bicycling group has been going to Wally's every Tuesday for at least several years.  We usually are a group of 10-20 that call ahead to reserve an outside table EVERY WEEK.  The service tonight was horrible, and I do not blame the server AT ALL, I blame the owner/manager.    Quite a few members of our group have worked in the \"service industry\" in the past, and we understand and commiserate with the difficulties of serving large groups.  We were patient and polite with our server, even with missed orders and extremely slow service.   We always tip the server well, because it is our belief that it is the fault of the owners when they don't provide enough servers to adequately cover the patrons without feeling overworked.   However, the owner/manager, Matt, felt it necessary to come to our table as we were finishing up paying to chastise us. I don't know that I have ever had an owner come to the table to express what bad customers we had been.  He stood at our table and told us that \"this didn't work tonight,\" and that, in the future, \"we could all figure out our bill and anyone who didn't want to order food can come up to the bar to order and pay themselves.\"  He also went on to say that \"regular tables had to wait\" and \"that staff comes first.\"  What are we if not regular customers?  If I was a restaurant and bar owner who had a large group coming every week spending a significant amount of money, I would be grateful and welcoming.  I would make sure that I had enough wait staff to cover the busy happy hour time period, or HELP OUT MYSELF.  As I was waiting 20 minutes for my first beer, I looked in through the window and saw Matt standing at the register.  I turned to my husband and said, \"I wonder why he hasn't stepped up to help.\"    I know that you are a well-established restaurant with a regular clientele, and may not need to be welcoming towards our group.  However, please think about the message that you sent to a group of twenty regular customers, that we weren't deserving of good service or respect.  There are many other establishments that we can frequent in the area, I only hope that you listen to what I have said and respond."}
{"text":"Okay, THIS place is the bomb-diggity!!! They are pretty reasonably priced for the amount of food they give you and oh... the food! Super delicious!! I've had a few different things there now and I'm NEVER let down!! Their French Onion soup is delicious and the cobb salad was outstanding! My ex always get their 4 cheese macaroni and LOVES it!!! You can NEVER go wrong with Wally's!!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Visited last nite after a brief stint at nearby gym.  We sat on the patio,  Great service, good food.  I had NY strip Caesar salad, with martini.  Steak was done perfectly.   GF had Cobb salad with white wine.   We hardly noticed the 3 pregnant women with the 3 toddlers running all over :).  Can't begrudge them for wanting good food!"}
{"text":"Got the gyuere and slab bacon s'mac. It was AMAZBALLS. There are about a dozen other things I want to try but so far so good. I can't wait to try something else."}
{"text":"out of town and want a guaranteed good gourmand experience this place does not dissapoint. staff is very friendly. I had the wine burger. served on a bakery style bun, it was super moist and the mix of fries, onion rings and sweetpotato fries was awesome. the wife had blacked chickens brie and I tried a tasty, very good. I would regular the place if I lived closer."}
{"text":"service is always fantastic.  food is consistently amazing.  i have enjoyed this place for years.  I highly recommend any burger they make, and also every soup they have, especially the chili, which typically has prime rib in it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Had the chicken marsala with a rich velvety marsala sauce, just right. The service from Tom was superb. Nice relaxed atmosphere, beautiful sitting on the patio tonight. Have you been here before, every time it's been great. A mix of semi fine dining and comfort food. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wally's is certainly a step above the normal pub food.  Don't let the name fool you.   There is another location in the Gainey Ranch area and the menu is diverse with everything from great salads to meatloaf that won't disappoint.  It's a little pricey, but the quality helps offset the hit to your pocketbook.  Great wine list and creative cocktail menu to boot."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on a recommendation and I was happy I did.  Wally seated us and he was really friendly along with all of the other staff.  They have great happy hour deals including delicious burgers!  Their mac n cheese was also really good.  We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Love Wally's - just an outstanding neighborhood bar and grill. Myself and my friends visit Wally's often and we are huge fans. The restaurant is always clean and inviting, the food is consistently excellent, and the service is terrific. Also, if you're a draft beer fan, they have a great selection.   I highly recommend the chop salad with cold chicken!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.  The service is great, they have a great, huge menu, and they are kid friendly.  It's a great place for a business lunch, a date, or to take the kids.  The Frisco burger is amazing."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we happened upon this place and were pleasantly surprised at how good the burgers tasted!    It was a nice evening so we sat outside (coming from the snow we had this winter, sitting outside was something I didn't think would ever happen again).    The menu was pretty extensive, I think anyone in your party should be able to find something to please them.  Usually I would expect with such a large menu the food would be just okay.  But not this place, at least not as far as the burgers.  I ordered the buttons and bleu burger and my boyfriend ordered bacon cheddar burger.  We both ordered our burgers medium rare and they were cooked perfectly!  There was a ton of mushrooms and bleu cheese on mine and lots of bacon and cheddar on his.  So much so, that he was able to share some bacon with me.    The burgers came with a mixture of regular fries and sweet potato fries (my favorite).  I loved the idea of mixing them so you don't have to decide on one or the other.    Overall, the food was delicious, the prices were fair (especially for amount of food) and outside sitting was perfect!  If ever in Phoenix again, I will definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"Food is great and the service is spot on. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great family friendly place. Food is fantastic and staff is nice and personable. They always greet you with a smile and care about your experience, whether it is for happy hour or dinner with family and friends. Great location with lots of parking available. Our family has been going for many years and will continue to for many years ahead."}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't give this place five stars because that would mean it is perfect and someone is giving you a foot rub and waving a palm frond over your head to keep you cool. But short of that, this place is a sanctuary for the traveler or resident who wants great food, a cool drink, and a place that will remind them of good pubs from the east coast, downtown London, or, well, Phoenix. If you want a burger or something hand crafted and with the word 'infused' they have it along with reasonable prices, and welcome wait staff. They might be a little short on 'after dinner' drinks or desserts that require fire, but what REAL American does their drinking after dinner and eats flaming ice cream anyways? We will leave that to the French.   Do yourself and that visiting family member a favor and take yourself and them here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is a secret place that you have to be \"in the know\".  The food is so scrumptious.  I have a very hard time keeping on a diet when I'm eating at Wally's.  There are plenty of wonderful healthy foods but I just love their sweet potato fries. and their Burbon Street Pasta.  The moment you walk in you see this gorgeous long antique bar that looks straight out of Tombstone. Of course me being a \"bar\" connoisseur this is the place I want to sit. The staff is so wonderful. The food is the best in town.  I hope to see you there because I will be there many times."}
{"text":"Why have I never been here before?! This cute little spot is hidden off of 44th Street & Camelback. We walked around & into the courtyard where we were greeted with a warm smile from the host. We decided to sit out on their patio to enjoy Phoenix's lovely weather (the inside was just as charming). Our waitress Julie told us the specials and provides excellent service. I ordered the Cuban which was delicious and instead of fries I subbed a fresh fruit cup for $1 more. The cup had pears, apples, strawberries, & blueberries. My co-worker ordered the Pear & Berrie Salad, she loved it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and great ambience. The food was great. Burgers, salads, and shrimp cocktail were great. My only complaint is that the service was a little slower than I would have liked  at a time when it wasn't very busy. Would definitely give it another try!"}
{"text":"Such a great neighborhood spot. I would have probably never tried this place had it not been for the recommendation of others but I'm so glad we did. It was pretty busy when we went and the entrance was very crowded and uncomfortable to wait in but once we got to our table everything got better. Service was perfect and everyone who works there from the hostess to the bussers were very warm and friendly. Started with the spinach artichoke dip- sooo good. I ordered the chicken picatta hesitantly because I never order chicken out (so easy to make at home) but holy cow definitely a chicken dish I will return for. The sauce was so scrumptious and the horseradish mashed potatoes went nicely as well. Only complaint is that the vegetables seemed previously frozen. Finished with the bread pudding which we gobbled up in seconds. We spent more money than we thought we would at a casual neighborhood spot but quality was consistent in everything we ordered and overall was worth it. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"They make a hellova Cuban! You won't be sad you ordered it! Service is good and fast enough for lunch on a work day."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying this place is way out there, but for sure worth the drive!   Our server was Nico and he was super friendly, knowledgeable and one of the best servers we've had! I ordered the Mac n cheese with bacon and some funky (yet delicious) cheese. My mom got the prime rib dip, and my dad the cheeseburger. All SO good! I'm usually not one for prime rib unless it's in a salad but this was good.   I didn't drink, but my mom enjoyed a few (too many) cosmos. She said they were strong, but not rubbing alcohol strong. Prices were a little higher than most, but once you see how much food you get its not bad at all!   Definitely recommend and make sure you ask for Nico!"}
{"text":"I would describe Wally's as \"comfort food.\" The crowd here is a good, healthy mix and the restaurant is kind of hidden in the Camelback Corridor area.   The pluses: - A great happy hour from 4-6  - Occasionally, you'll get a stellar sale on wine (A co-worker and I got a dry Riesling on sale for $12!) - Cozy patio - Consistent service - \"Hole in the wall\" feeling to the place  The negatives: - \"Comfort food\" isn't usually healthy food - A little pricey for what you get...  If you're in the area, it's definitely a great place to try.  But I wouldn't go out of your way to try it!"}
{"text":"OK - love this place. It is great. Family owned and operated. Wally is a star and his staff are fantastic. Cannot say enough about this place. Great place for family meals and a overall great time.   My kids love the Mack and Cheese. A pure favorite. Suggest that you try it out. Great food, great service and a team that is there to please. Arizona needs more of these establishments. Stay away from the chasins - make these local places florish!"}
{"text":"Love Wallys!    Mac and cheese! Fish and chips!  Hummus, French Onion soup! The food is solid!   The pineapple infusion and sangria are freaking amazing!  My only issue is the limited amount of low tables.  When I go here with my parents it's not comfortable for them to be up high. There are only a few low tables inside and if it's busy you are out of luck.   Oh and Wally has some good wine!  Nice to see that at a bar."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Saturday around noon. I was planning on getting just one beer. I had the Four Peaks Hop Leaf and it was really good. But wait, they had another. I tried the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, and it was even better! The keg ran out, and I had a enjoyable front row seat as the staff had a little difficulty replacing the keg. Jokes were made. Maybe some feelings were hurt. Vindication was had shortly later.  I stayed for three beers, originally intending on staying for just one. I really enjoyed the staff (super attentive), the ambience, and the beers. I will definitely come back every chance I have."}
{"text":"Are you bored with being treated nicely and with respect by restaurant proprietors? Tired of being treated decently by the folks to whom you are about to give money?  If so, then Wally's is the place for you. Insults and rudeness are the daily special. On our visit, we had trouble finding it because of the glare of the setting sun. I called and immediately apologized for having to ask for directions but could he help. \"You're challenged,\" the guy running the place declared. But he did us one better! When I went in to ask if that was normal treatment for customers, he said I couldn't take a joke, said \"goodbye\" and made a wisecrack about knowing where they are. The motto must be: \"The customer is always worth insulting.\""}
{"text":"Except for one incident, this was a good experience and a great burger. Went for a Saturday happy Hour (3-6pm) which in itself is a good thing to have a daily HH. All burgers are $7.50 and normally the Bacon, Cheddar burger I received was $12, so it was a great deal. The fries were not as good as hyped, but it was a great burger and cooked perfectly well done. Well worth that price, maybe even $12 if you were in a burger craving mood. Now, my issue was not related to my food, but there was a  waiter who was grabbing straws from the dispenser by the top of the straw (where we drink from) and then putting it straight into unsuspecting folks drinks. I watched him do it three straight times and finally told him it was nasty and what the hell are you doing? He claimed that he normally does not grab the straws that style, but we all know he does and nobody pulls the wool over my eyes. Just a heads up. I would have mentioned it to the manager, but he was chewing gum like a cow while talking to customers, so the behavior must be trickling down from the top."}
{"text":"Wally's is one of our favorite places to eat lunch and dinner. It has a neighborhood feel to it, and the food is consistently delish! The owner, Wally, and his son's run the 2 restaurants and treat everyone that walks in the door like an old friend--which I love.  Their grilled artichokes are to die for, and the pot roast is a must, especially on cold days. The Danish ribs are the best that I've had in the Valley--they fall off the bone and have a devine flavor. Friday lunch special is fish tacos and they are absolutely wonderful! I can go on and on, but you must try this wonderful place yourself!"}
{"text":"Second visit was just as good as the first. Had the bangers and mashed this time. Great sausage and a large portion. Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. It is not pretentious but rather a great place to grab a bite with people who are glad to see you. Friendly staff, sometimes Wally will actually greet you and get your drinks. Great menu with salads and typical pub style fare but also awesome salads. Always recommend you ask about the special of the day. There are some great ones.   I have not been for happy hour, but I will admit, the beer on tap and whiskey selection appear to be enough to satisfy any happy hour need.   By the way, Tuesday is Ta-tor Tot Tuesday & the sweat potato fries can make it a toss up. So check it out...you will be back."}
{"text":"We rode our bikes here ther other night and had a wonderful time and dinner for two + 2 drinks for $25. The food was very fresh and the patio is great. The \"hold in the wall\" feeling Nikki talks about is dead on! Try it out sometime when you just don't know where to go!"}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times!  Food is always beyond spot on! Service is always friendly and attentive! Great happy hour 7 days a week! Gotta try the grilled artichoke! We've tried lots off the menu and everything is incredible!"}
{"text":"Dining with a group here was quite a pleasant experience and our group had no problem being seated immediately, thanks to a reservation made by Scott W. who organized this dinner gathering. Service was efficient, especially considering that it was a busy evening at the restaurant. It seems to me that this is one of the few establishments that does liver and onions right: perfectly cooked and seasoned, with minimal breading; it is served over mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables,the perfect sides for this dish. Seating was a bit tight but since this is a very popular restaurant, that is an unavoidable consequence of having lots of seats in a moderately sized, not huge, space. Parking is a bit of an issue at the front of the building, but additional spaces are available at the back."}
{"text":"I can always rely on Wally's for a great dinner. Their pot roast is absolutely to die for, and they have a great selection of other foods. The staff is friendly, and they're in a great location. My only complaint is that it's a bit crowded, but I'd say that just adds to the authentic-ness (is that a word? Ha) of being a pub."}
{"text":"An Irish pub on St. Paddy's day must be done!  I came here on Paddy's day for a few beers and lunch.  This is a place I could see myself frequenting once a week.  It has a down to earth vibe to it even though its in Arcadia.  I had the Shepherds pie for lunch.  I wasn't a fan of it, but it wasn't god awful.  I've definitely had better.  I just wish you could smoke on the patio!"}
{"text":"Wally's is my good ole go-to! It seems that there are very few decent straight up American restaurants in the Biltmore/Arcadia area. Whenever I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for, or don't want to be bothered with a hustle & bustle type place, Wally's it is!   Don't expect to order healthy here, their menu is more on the side of comfort food, that being said I've never had a bad meal. The portions are very generous, and the prices are reasonable. The service here is so welcoming, they treat you as if you've been coming here for years. They have great sangria and lots of decent beer on tap to go with their delicious food. My favorite dish so far has been the Prime Rib dip, it's fantastic and full of flavor, and they also have awesome fries (a mix of sweet potato and regular). This place is totally worth the cheat! I highly recommend Wally's, as it's a great local restaurant."}
{"text":"Cute, quaint little pub. There's nothing like a good, stiff drink on a lazy Sunday afternoon!   I tried the calamari for an appetizer. It was served hot. Nothing unusual or different about it. Now the California Cobb salad; (yum) it was gigantic! ...very hearty! Our waitress was on her second day on the job, but one could barely tell it. Well, outside of forgetting little things ...like silverware, parts of the food order, and other small requests... She had a very friendly attitude and she knew the daily specials and MOST of the menu...very impressive for a second day.  Pet-friendly, outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"Fairly expensive place for what it is. I think it's prob a good place for middle aged ppl to go out and have beer. Not really my style but food and beers were decent."}
{"text":"My first time here for lunch. I went with 2 other friends.   What we had: Appetizer: artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips  Lunch: fish and chips, and their special of the day meatballs.  We got our appetizer and it was good. The fish and chips were a little on the greasy side, but what do you expect for fried fish and french fries. The meatballs... that's another story. They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise). There were 4 meatballs for $7.95. I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged. I could not handle the licorice taste. I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it \"to go\" as we were running out of time. When the check came, they did not take the meatballs off and asked the waitress about it. Come to find out that the OWNER said \"JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT, I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT!\". I WAS SHOCKED!!!!  I told her, then I didn't want the fish and chips. I only ordered a higher price item as not to walk out with only a $30 bill.    We ended up leaving paying $46, $8.00 for the meatballs that I only had 1 bite out of! It's a good thing I ate my share of the artichoke dip or I would have STARVED!  I WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered fish and chips and a chicken sandwich.  Three stars because the chicken was severely undercooked and service unfriendly..  Sent chicken back and ordered fish as my husband said it was good.  It was good.  The tarter sauce was too sweet.  Fries were fine.  Overall the food is expensive for casual fare, $40 for lunch.  This will not be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Review is for the Friday prime rib special which didn't earn any awards for best in class IMHO however the meat quality was very good, served a perfect medium rare but lacked flavor, this is the third PR I've had this year at good restaurants that seemed to lack flavor so could be I'm used to the family recipe which might be overly seasoned.  For $25 with salad and desert I would not hesitate to recommend this special; service was good for a bar / restaurant settings and the blue cheese salad dressing was excellent.  My friend devoured his steak so my less then 5 stars is a personal rating, my dining partner would likely disagree.."}
{"text":"I have been to this place for drinks and possibly food over a year ago. It was time to stop by for a casual dinner. I was eating light this night so ordered a salad which said : field greens, apple, berry, fresh mozzarella, and I added chicken. This dish was an embarrassment to salads. Hardly any greens, maybe half a chix breast, and mozzarella u could barely notice.   Husband had chix parm: nice size dish he liked it.   This is a cool place to have a drink but the food NO WAY. It is not memorable and there are too many other food places close by."}
{"text":"Thanks Wally's! We've eaten with you two times his past week. You are our neighborhood go to spot. We have never had a bad meal in nearly a decade....until this week, thanks for taking the \"Cajun meatloaf\" away and replacing it with a staple-fish and chips! YUM! We appreciated your great service in keeping us happy. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips! Husband loved his beef stroganoff, too. Would skip on the brownie dessert, didn't think it was that good for $8 and $5 for an extra scoop of ice cream?! But overall great food and we will return!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar and grill.  It is your basic menu with some surprises and daily dinner and soup specials .  I always seem to get the same things every time I go... I either like the London Beef Dip with fries (fries come with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries which are yummy) or if I am looking for something a little lighter I love their chopped salad.  They make a house sangria that is fantastic and they also make their own infused pineapple vodka which is very tasty too."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink after dinner at Flower Child tonight.  A friendly, local crowd was in this casual bar/restaurant.  We sat at the bar to watch preseason football and enjoy a beer.  The bartender was busy and not very engaging, but we weren't really looking to chat her up anyway.  Overall, a good experience!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite haunts.   They know you by name and what you like!   Great patio!  Great food!  Great staff!"}
{"text":"Great local pub with an extended selection of bar dishes!  They have amazing mac n cheese with various types offered.  The servers are attentive without being bothersome and also extremely knowledgable.  I have dined here twice now and have had an enjoyable casual dining experience both times.  This is a great place in a wonderful neighborhood to kick back in a casual atmosphere for those days you don't want to get all dolled up to go out for a nice meal :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have great portions and great staff. The place is very classy and in a great location. Try the creme brûlée - you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger in town! Casual comfort food with a great selection of wine and drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a casual lunch. It's within a beautiful little plaza and the food does not disappoint. Although the tables are a little close together, it wasn't a problem because it wasn't packed when I went. The server was very attentive and she even left a carafe of diet coke on the table for us. We order the spinach as an appetizer and it was very tasty. We also split the mac and cheese and the mushroom and bleu cheese burger. The mac and cheese was amazing, I could've eaten it all day! The burger was cooked perfectly and I liked the mixed of regular fries with sweet potato fries and onion rings. I would definitely come back and recommend Wally's to my friends!"}
{"text":"Wally's bills itself as a neighborhood grill - it's in our neighborhood so we like to frequent it. The food is good and the portion sizes are enough to take some home and have the next day. I tried the french dip with prime rib for the first time and it was mighty good! I'm not a fan of liver and onions, but have been told that Wally's knows how to make it taste yummy. Great atmosphere, nice outside eating area, great menu selection. All around a good place.  We did have a strange occurance after our last visit. We went with friends and split the tab 50-50. While we were in the parking lot saying our goodbyes to our friends, the waiter came out & asked if everything was ok - if our experience was good. We all said yes, and he said he just wondered because when he gets a 10% tip, he'd like to know why. I know we gave him a nice tip - I have no idea what our friends tipped, but I thought it was incredibly rude that he would come out to question us! We've never had this experience at any eating establishment anywhere - I was really taken back. This is not indicitive of Wally's - but Wally, if you read this, please know this didn't set well with a \"Wally's Club\" member."}
{"text":"While these stars are not for a healthy meal, they are for a delicious one!! The food here is unbelievable and I find myself craving the dishes I've tried: the tuna sandwich and the veggie burger. My friend had the meatloaf and despite the giant portion, was able to finish it all because it was that good. The service is also great and the ambience was an unexpected surprise. Very cozy and homey with a hint of old world charm. All around, a highly recommended neighborhood establishment!!"}
{"text":"YUM! Mac N Cheese Skillets...the cheeseburger one is like Hamburger Helper LOL, so yummy. The side of sautéed spinach was yumalish too. My business partner got the chicken brie sandwich which looked great too and the mix of sweet potato, regular fries and onion rings is a great idea, unique. I saw MANY things that I would eat here when cheating :) Definitely not a healthy food place although they did have salads and veggie burgers. Very loud inside, UK beers on draft, nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Reliably delicious food in a bustling 44th Street & Camelback location. Try going at off-peak hours as this place fills up fast and gets on the noisy side. Try the escargot for an appetizer--super savory! The bangers and mash is my favorite selection for dinner."}
{"text":"This used to be my neighborhood place to eat and enjoy; however over the course of several months, service, quality, and caring for customers is null and void.    We came back this evening to eat dinner and also order take out for the entire family and the food was okay, but customer service failed.  The bartender (B-th) that was serving us, told us they didn't have what we would want to order as an after dinner drink ----  it's a full bar---right?    Oh wait, either she had a great friend or a new hook up at the end of the bar that weighs over paying customers....one time, ok - two times, eeehhh - maybe the place is going through challenges ---- three times --- \" not going back \" ----- fourth time I'll give it another try - ummmmm -  that's it - pricey with HORRIFIC customer service?  Not ok.... go to a place that has excellent customer service and amazing food - like Wink 24 (local) or Deici --- right down the street - YELP IT!"}
{"text":"Wally's is kind of hidden gem tucked away in a shopping center on 44th Street and Camelback.  There's nothing like an evening meal on their comfortable patio after the sun has set. The patio is dog friendly as well. I've been here a few times and really have enjoyed everything I have ordered; my favorite is the Cuban Sandwich. My wife loves the Chicken Sandwich with the Brie cheese.  Last time I was there, they forgot to send a server to our table for about 10 minutes. The Manager took responsibility for the oversight and offered my wife and I dessert on the house. We decided to share a creme brulee, which was excellent. That was definitely a case of turning a lemon into lemonade in my book.  It's definitely been too long since I've been to Wally's."}
{"text":"My dynamic trio (me, fiancee and a friend), who always seem to frequent happy hour together at new places, checked out Wally's last night after a hair appointment at Moments Salon (a couple doors down).   We were seating right away at around 7pm, the place was packed (and LOUD) inside, so we opted for the patio, which turned out to be a bit warm until the misters kicked on at the pizza place across the sidewalk. Ha! But hey- sitting outside on October 1st in Phoenix is a gamble when it comes to the temperature...  I immediately got the feeling that we had unwittingly selected a restaurant full of delicious secrets only the locals know about- you know, one of those places the Food Network would check out. :) And yes, in my opinion, Wally's feels more like a restaurant than a pub, since we were seated immediately with menus and assigned a server wearing an actual apron.  After ordering pints of 4 Peaks Hefeweizen and Negra Modelo, we decided we weren't hungry enough for dinner and ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and Prawn Cocktail. I enjoyed the spin-art dip- a more generous portion than most places are serving for appetizers these days, standard flavors, served hot with perfectly salted tortilla chips. The Prawn Cocktail was nothing to write home about- average-sized shrimp and the cocktail sauce was, IMHO, seriously lacking in \"zest.\" Then again, I like a pretty kickin cocktail sauce, full of horseradish.  I held back on the \"stars\" since we didn't order meals, but Chad, our server, didn't bat an eye when we announced we weren't having dinner- just delivered the check quickly and politely.   I may up the \"stars\" when we go back- saw several menu items that looked enticing, including S'Macs- baked mac and cheese in several varieties, prime rib with goat cheese mashed potatoes and pan-seared halibut.   I'll be back... probably soon. Got another hair appointment, soon... :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Feels like home cooked meals. Meat loaf is my favorite dish but I have a feeling everything is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Wally's is a gem in this area of mediocre trendy restaurants.  The service is always genuine and friendly the food just awesome.  Tried the Cabbage and Corn Beef.....perfect.   The meat loaf just like Moms.  The Chicken Parm so good.  My drink is never empty the waiters are so on top of it."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop in for a last-minute decision on dinner.  Happened to be a Sunday night and they had half off wine by the bottle (score!) As I was in a pickle-y mood, I decided to get the Cuban sandwich.  This is maybe my favorite Cuban to date!  There were SPEARS of pickles, chipotle mayo, roasted pork loin, thick sliced ham and a grain mustard piled high on a ciabatta-type bread. It was reaaallll good. Came with mixed fries (half sweet potato) which was just what I wanted... I only ate half and the other half was my lunch today (still delicious when cold.) Wally's has 'Blue Plate Specials' that change every day. One of our party got the Iron Skillet Chicken which he ate all of... The special comes with dessert, white chocolate bread pudding, which I got to nibble on since he doesn't like raisins (double score!)  Overall, the food is really good and very fair priced. The wine was also priced really well and a bonus at half off.  Our server was prompt, made great recommendations and never let our glasses go empty.  I hope to get back here soon!!"}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood restaurant! The atmosphere is cozy and friendly, the food is tasty and the prices are reasonable. What more can you ask for? We came here for dinner and sat at the bar but will definitely take advantage of their spacious outdoor patio next time. I ordered the veggie burger with a honey glaze coat which was amazing! My husband got the French dip and I stole a delicious bite. I want to order that next time. The sides were the best because they provide a mix of regular fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings! Perfection!"}
{"text":"We are out of towners and thanks to the yelp reviews, we decided to come here for lunch on a beautiful April afternoon. Our server was fast and friendly. Ordered the local red ale and it was cold and tasty.  My hubs got the smacs with Gruyere and bacon. He devoured it!  I got the grilled artichokes! Loved them!  The blackened chicken and Brie sandwich with mixed fries. It was delicious and ample. Please try this restaurant and sit outside if it's pretty! We had a memorable experience here."}
{"text":"It seems better since Jr took over. As of 2 weeks ago, no true manager.And servers seemed unprofessional. Worth another try. Just wondering why the owners would have 3 places within 6 blocks. Somewhat similar concepts."}
{"text":"The bartender was pretty clueless last night. During happy hour she spent five minutes stocking the beer cooler with her back to the bar. When she finished did she check to see if anyone needed a drink? No, she checked her phone by the register and sent a text. Only then did she come down the bar to ask for my order.  I asked what was on happy hour and she rattled off a few beers and stopped. I stared at her and asked about cocktails. Only then did she mention the spirits on HH.  I ended up with a margarita which was pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Wally's based upon a recommendation of a friend, and it is definitely a place to add to your favorites while in Phoenix.  A family run establishment which has great food and drink selections.  A real Pub, with a casual atmosphere and it's not sports bar-ish.    Ask for the daily specials.  The ribs are great but get there before they run out."}
{"text":"Came here with the family on St. Patrick's Day. As expected, the place was definitely busy but we noticed the entire staff working together to make sure everyone was seated as soon as possible. There was a slight hiccup when someone else answered the call for our table. However, once we figured out what had happened we were seated immediately. The menu was fixed for St. Patrick's Day so we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip for and appetizer; my husband got the shepherd's pie, my daughter had the chicken fingers, and I enjoyed the fish and chips. Everything came out quickly and hot. The food was delicious! We finished off with the bread pudding for dessert...heavenly!!! We will definitely be returning for another visit!"}
{"text":"I heard from a friend about this place. So i decided to give it a try, he so far has not lead me wrong. Once finding a place to park and entering, the manager introduced himself and was pleasant to talked to. A great place that doesn't have the \"franchise\" tag on it and definately a place where you don't mind coming back.  Having the 'Frisco burger and Hefeweizen, I had no complaints...  the fries were mixed together, regular and sweet potatoe (nice touch). Decent selection of beers on tap, attractive waitresses and great people who you can see enjoy their job. Definately a place I intend of coming back"}
{"text":"I've heard from several people that Wally's is like a Phoenix landmark... it's been around for awhile and they supposedly have a great happy hour!  Crazy that in my 3 years in Phoenix, today was my first visit to Wally's, but it won't be my last!  I met 2 friends for lunch.  When we made our plans, they both suggested Wally's because of their convenient location and their 'caramelized vidalia onion & Guinness soup.'  I'm not a fan of french onion soup, but I really wanted to try Wally's anyways, so that's what we did!  I was acknowledged upon walking in by Chip, the General Manager... he was extremely friendly and suggested we sit outside since It was a beautiful day.  He was right - sitting on the patio was perfect!  Service was attentive and cold drinks were brought out right away... we started with the hot artichoke and spinach dip for the table... yum!  Good thing I worked out this morning, because I didn't feel quite as guilty enjoying this delicious appetizer - it was really tasty, and a generous portion too!  Of course, my friends Rachel and Lesley ordered the soup as planned - they both seemed to enjoy it.  I went with the Cobb salad.  It was your standard Cobb - with chicken, romaine and iceberg, diced tomato, egg, bleu cheese crumbles, avocado slices, chopped bacon, and balsamic dressing which I requested on the side.  It was good, but I think I was full from the chips and artichoke/spinach dip appetizer, so I couldn't finish it all.  Too full for dessert as well...  I'll have to return to Wally's for sure though - they had a pretty impressive bar menu with a ton of liquor, beer, and martinis too!  I noticed they had a kids menu, and some of my favorite desserts as well (hot apple pie and carrot cake).    Wally's happy hour is from 4-6p M-F with $1 off cocktails & beer and $2 off all appetizers... I'll be back for more of that artichoke and spinach dip with a beer or 2 next time for sure!  See you there!"}
{"text":"Cute pub and Atmosphere but slow service. My friends and I went in at lunchtime on a Saturday and it took about 30 minutes before our order for appitizers was taken and it took our entrees 20 minutes to come out after our order was placed placed. The restaurant was only a fourth of the way full so I'm not sure what was taking so long. I'll have to give this place another try another day. Maybe today was just not a great day for them."}
{"text":"A fellow Yelper mentioned she liked the liver and onions here so I gathered up a crew that I knew most of them liked liver and onions tried this place. Before going I looked at the menu and found they had beef stroganoff which may even be rarer in restaurants than liver and onions. I settled for a bit of liver and got the stroganoff. I am pretty sure that was the best stroganoff I have had in a restaurant. Several folks tried the French Onion soup and liked it. Some of our party arrived early for our reservation, one on crutches, and they were seated promptly with out having to wait until we were all there. Even though they were packed the service was good and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. The only negative is between AJ's and several popular restaurants all on the same property parking is really hard to come by."}
{"text":"Wally`s is my number one go to place in Phoenix to eat and bring people to when they are visiting. I go to Phoenix a few times a month and I frequently find myself eating here.  Their Gruyere and slab bacon s` mac is to die for. Probably my favorite Mac and cheese ever. And I eat a lot of Mac and cheese. Super good atmosphere for a date and they have great service. They were awesome to us last night and they were busy.  It was Valentine's and we still got timely and great service. Love Wallys!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of Wally's. Garlic blue cheese escargot delicious! Great wine menu and amazing dining options. Check them out!"}
{"text":"This place is simply Amaze.. Me nd my fiancé came to try the food cause i was working in the next door building nd smelled the food.. words cannot describe the flavorfullness of our meals which was the  Bourbon pasta nd i had the the NY steak sandwich... Thx mommys fr the amaze service nd  keep ur jeans high an tite.."}
{"text":"Wally's has a fun Cheer's like atmosphere. It's dog friendly and allows you to bring your dog on the patio. I recently ate on the patio with a friend and our three dogs. They catered to us and our dogs were very chill. It was a wonderful experience! The Wally's at Gainey ranch has a Dog Days Sundays event every Sunday."}
{"text":"Went for Father's Day and always like the food. Nice family friendly. Very relaxed environment. Love their spicy Louisiana Pasta, their burgers are good too. Girl with black hair and green eyes is alwasys so nice!"}
{"text":"Swung by on a Wednesday to take advantage of their solid happy hour specials.  They have a great selection of $4 draft beers and $8 burgers (typically $11-$12) which is a great value compared to all of the other places in this area.  You don't even have to look too hard to find Wally which is cool considering the LGO and Fox takeover that is going on in the area (yikes!).    Grassroots Kitchen is also pretty legit and I believe Wally's son runs it.  It's near 20th Street and Camelback and worth checking out as well."}
{"text":"Just spent $25 for cold wings and two beers. If I wanted leftovers I would have stayed home for free!"}
{"text":"Thank god for the delicious food, because the poor service I've received from Shannon on numerous occasions for take-out would have deterred me from coming back a long time ago."}
{"text":"Service was beyond horrible. Food was good, some of it even really good but the service overshadowed it. I reserved a table for 12 for a casual affair, 4 of us arrived early and ordered drinks. He literally brought one drink at a time and this continued all nite even after the rest of the party arrived and started ordering drinks ( not sure if they have trays or he just didn't know to use one). Our food was ordered and, again, our food came out in stages. My friend ordered a burger and another person ordered a salad. Those were the last meals to come out after most of us had gotten ours for at least 10-15 minutes. When we got there, there were about 6 tables with people, not a lot of people. By the time we left the place was full, but I had seen people come in, eat and leave before we even got food."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago, and was curious to see how the service would be after seeing some of the other recent low reviews.  I have to say that I was very impressed--our server was fantastic, and the manager and another server also stopped by our table to say hello and check on whether our food was enjoyable (which it was!).  Excellent comfort food in a cozy setting, with strong drinks! The only thing I'd like a little more of would be a more extensive mixed drink selection, but based on what they offer, they seem able to accommodate most typical drink requests. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for some good old-fashioned 'murican grub! I came with the infamous Tom, who is well known in the pub, and that told me right off the bat this is an awesome place to come!  We had a great waitress who was quick and friendly! I had the Home-Made Veggie Burger, and would recommend it, if you are into that kind of stuff. It was incredibly juicy, sticky and impossible to really eat like a regular burger. But, alas, I guess that is what you get! The flavor was spot on, just had to use the fork to get to it. I also really enjoyed the mixed fries! I had never had sweet potato fries, but I'm willing to try them again! Also, the mac 'n cheese plate looks amazing. Killer and heart-burning, but delicious. Kinda pricey, I thought, but I haven't been around the area too long yet."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I've been here a few times and the staff is always pleasant and the food is always good.  They have great happy hour food & drink specials."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have the best Irish coffee in Phoenix. They also have a great Artichoke. I don't think we have had anything that hasn't been good here.  The staff has always been friendly and very attentive and always ready to help if you have a question about the menu. It has a great atmosphere and welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Neighborhood spot with great, homemade food. The french dip was incredible as were the ribs. Looking forward to coming back to try the burgers which looked amazing. Only improvements I'd like to see are more local draft options"}
{"text":"Solid menu! Great food and good atmosphere. Everything that I have had here has been delicious. Burgers, Fish & Chips, and Escargot are all delicious. The fruit infused vodka is a must try."}
{"text":"Went in early on a Wednesday night, took our 4 year old.  I just didn't feel like cooking, but I was not prepared for Wally's.  I had the Grueryre Mac n Cheese, my wife had the salmon special, and my son had the spaghetti and meatballs kids meal.   Everything we ordered was best of its class.  The S'mac was heavenly, the salmon was a huge, moist, and expertly cooked.  They also had an impressive drink and food menu.  Plus it was laid back, and our server Shawn was top rate.  We'll be back, I cannot believe there isn't a line to get in."}
{"text":"What a great deal for happy hour.  The food was excellent, the services was 4 star.and the prices were right where they should be. The rueben was the best REUBEN my wife has everr had,,,, so lean and tasty."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Scottsdale we randomly found this place and decided to go inside and boy were we impressed.  The ribs were perfect and amazing as was the fish and chips.  Our waiter Jeremy was a pleasure he made us laugh and feel welcome.  Wouldn't mind if he sat down and ate with us he was great!  Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Darn good!  I got the bacon s'mac with gorgonzola and WOW.  Be warned, its a big ol' serving!  This could easily be split between three people.  The gorgonzola is so rich and the huge servings of bacon is just insane by any carnivores standards.  Next time we visit Scottsdale we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is for Wally's American Pub/Grill over on Double Tree Ranch Road in Scottsdale - just off Scottsdale Road.  Very good food and a delightfully designed restaurant.  Excellent for a casual meal or for bringing business clients. The food is first-rate!"}
{"text":"God this place is good.  Stepping into their dinning room is like being with friends.  It's quaint and comfortable and the servers are always friendly.  As for the food, it is equally as enjoyable.  The mac n cheese is to die for and the fish n chips is the best I've had in the valley.  Their homemade tartar sauce is what really sets them apart.   It's a little tucked away, but quite the gem."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine in the valley - everything is YUMMY /prices are reasonable / nice variety of items on happy hour menu/ outside dining/ great service"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the prime rib sandwich recommended by the manager & shared pasta bacon dish with heavy cheese sauce. Interesting classic pub decor . Popular local pub nestled in rear  of Whole Foods older gentrified mall next to poplar Villages of Camelback Raquetclub & Spa."}
{"text":"My work colleagues and I stumbled onto this rare gem of the desert while on a business trip. After a long day of work, we jumped into our car and decided to drive to a restaurant close to our hotel. We took a chance on Wally's and were all astounded by the food quality and fantastic service we received on our visit. Everything was great! It was so good that we broke all road warrior tradition and actually went back to the same place to eat dinner the next three nights instead of exploring other options like we normally do! If you want great comfort food that is prepared elegantly and simply, check out Wally's. Some personal favorites of mine and our team: Pot Roast, The French Onion Soup is legendary, the fish was great (go figure considering it is in the middle of the desert), all the mac and cheese dishes were fantastic. The food servers are very accommodating, and the owner is always kind and willing to accomidate even quirky requests. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were heading for the Cork & Cleaver for lunch when it was discovered they were closed due to a fire. Lucky for us we ended up at Wally's and what a find this place is. The employee's are terrific and they really seem to enjoy their jobs. From the moment we walked in we felt like our patronage was wanted. Very comfortable and the greatest part, the food was outstanding. We will be back and will bring our friends with us. Thanks Wally's for a great lunch"}
{"text":"One of our favorite pubs in the Arcadia area. Nothing disappoints! Always friendly service and clientele. Even as busy as at is Sunday evenings the service was quick and friendly.  The best thing about this place is the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"We have driven past this place a million times and hadn't thought to go in until one day we just took the plunge. Its in a great spot and they even have room for a cute little patio. Although I wanted to be bad and get every fried item on the menu, hubby and I opted for some yummy salads. I had the cobb and he had the asian salad. Both were fresh and delicious and we would get them again but next time I go, I want to try some of the other items. We saw food come out and it looked great! Its definitely a nice lunch spot and I am sure dinner is great too, but you can also see it being a great place to belly up and hang out."}
{"text":"Wally's is fab. The decoration is like a classy den with some memorabilia and Americana, but nothing overbearing or tacky. Very casual and convenient, the bartenders are very friendly, and the place is seemingly run by people all very comfortable and familiar with each other (something I really like). Great beers on tap, some super wines, and the food is above average (lots of variety... think Village Tavern with an edge). It's popular with Arcadia residents, but is still politely tucked away, so you rarely have to worry about the crowds. They also stay open until everyone leaves, so getting a big party in late may not be a problem."}
{"text":"Always leave here smiling. Have had most everything on the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't great. Love the corned beef and cabbage nite! Salads are all super! Love the Cuban sandwich and wash it down with a Gunners on tap! Nirvana!"}
{"text":"We finally made our way over here for dinner. We sat outside in their patio area which is cozy, and dog friendly! I had their French Dip and I must admit, it was the best I have ever had. The roll is so soft, and they serve it with a side of horseradish aioli. Yum! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their dinner. And the service is fabulous, everyone was so pleasant.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Seems like a happening spot. Very busy for a Tuesday. Great part of Scottsdale. They have a bread pudding for desert. The ribs were amazing; melt in your mouth. They have Smithwicks on tap oh yeah."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here. The entire atmosphere is welcoming and very well done-it devote takes you away to a different place. It actually reminded my husband and I of some of the cute spots we dined at in Europe.  Our server was sweet and attentive, offering recommendations and being. Patient when our party simply couldn't decide what to eat from the awesome menu.   The food-where do I begin-it was all great! We started with wings. As suggested, we ordered them extra crispy with the sauce on the side as suggested and were not disappointed. Good flavor and perfectly cooked. The beer was ice cold. For entrees, it was definitely hard to decide. Their menu is varied with dishes that frankly l look great. We ordered bangers and mash, a prime rib dip sandwich, short ribs, and chicken Marsala. We all tasted everything and he food was all great. I also started with a cup of heir onion soup which was by far, the best I ever had. Perfectly cooked and seasoned and good portions. We are already planning on going back. Great experience all around- a true gem."}
{"text":"My overall favorite restaurant for down-home food, service, and relaxation.   I trust the servers to steer me in the right direction.   The Mgr is engaging and the food is consistent.   Our daughter loves the SMACs, my wife loves the beet salad, and I prefer the sandwiches or prime rib.   My only comment is I wish they had a larger on-tap beer selection."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the neighborhood and this location fit the bill for lunch recently.  They have a nice (dog friendly too) patio with plenty of shade and greenery.  I like patio dining and this worked well.   Unfortunately our lunch was only fair.  I had a caprese salad - mozzarella was perfect as were the greens & balsamic dressing but the heriloom tomato was rock hard.  Nice idea but try to eat green tomato as one of the main features of a salad, not so good.  Shouldn't they atleast try to serve a partially ripened tomato?  I mean someone had to hack through this rock to put it on the plate.  Burger was good, nothing spectacular - accompanied by a side salad loaded with onions and some funky version of their bleu cheese dressing (lots of pepper).    Our waiter was so-so.  One of those guys that doesn't write anything down and doesn't remember anything you specially requested.  And forget about returning to the table to see how everything is after food was delivered.  We had to track HIM down.    Maybe this was an off day or perhaps I  ust ordered the wrong thing.  I might go back if I were in the area again - if only for the patio experience and I'm not particularly hungry."}
{"text":"I had blackened salmon salad, fish was cooked perfect, with crisp outside and perfectly cooked inside. Meatloaf was top drawer, a must if your a meat and potato lover.   The infused pineapple vodka was real nice, not strong, yet refreshing"}
{"text":"Great place.  Food is very good, inside is nice, good service, and overall a cool place.  This place caters to a slightly older demographic (say 40-60), but we still love this neighborhood pub.  Can't go wrong with the cob salad.  Try the pinapple infused vodka."}
{"text":"Wally's is an upscale pub with a price tag to match but the menu is carefully thought out, well prepared and (usually) served with a smile."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant!  I have never had a bad meal or bad service here. When you walk in you are warmly greeted like an old friend and no matter how packed they are they always find a table to accommodate you. The menu has lots to choose from; burgers, sandwiches, salads, soups (french onion is my favorite), entrees (chicken pot pie or fish n chips are scrumptious), and great desserts as well. The atmosphere is charming and fun; perfect place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Blue cheese escargot is amazing, pineapple martini was outstanding. Portions are generous, service is friendly and attentive, great location."}
{"text":"As in the name, a pub type atmosphere.  Food was way overpriced for pub food. $10 for a wedge salad and $12 for a burger.  Service was mediocre, waitress seemed more interested in helping out some friends than customers."}
{"text":"This is the best neighborhood grill & bar you can find.  Not only does it have a cool, old-school tavern feel in a great location, but the food is phenomenal. This isn't your standard pub fare. There's a chef in that kitchen preparing traditional dishes with a little extra to each one...and the daily specials are amazing. Dad's Fried Chicken with HMP and a homemade biscuit...yum!  The S'macs are killer!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Mac and cheese with andouille sausage to die for, portion enough to share if you get appetizers. Service incredible, owner is an Ernest Hemingway look alike and I am a fan. I was star struck."}
{"text":"A family friendly place with consistently good food and service!  Excellent happy hour, excellent menu... it is one of my favorite places to meet folks for dinner!"}
{"text":"Best place in town for Friday night Prime Rib!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming in for about 15 years and have never had a bad meal or bad service, ever. It was especially cool when Wally would bring his Mastiff to work, I loved that dog! I was raised in MT so I really love the meatloaf and the pot roast, just as good as grandma cooked. The Chinese chicken salad rocks, as does the Chicken Vesuvius. If you have a sweet tooth, be sure to order the huge chocolate cake. Yum! Thank you for your wonderful food and great service all of these years. I will be coming in for many more years."}
{"text":"Good solid American food, albiet high prices.   Wally's has never disappointed me when I have been looking for a heavy, high fat, filling meal of American \"cuisine.\" This place is a great spot to visit if you have no regard for your health but high regard for your taste buds. It's leaps and bounds better than your typical pubs, serving good quality food rather than the apropos french fries and chicken fingers. Sure, they will serve you chicken fingers, but I much prefer the Bourbon Street Pasta, a cajun pasta with peppers, cream sauce, sausage, and chicken?  There is an upstairs, downstairs, and a nice patio, and they have a good staff. There is nothing groundbreaking about any aspect of this establishment, but you can always bet it will be a satisfying meal for anyone considering going to a bar for dinner."}
{"text":"So we got seated and then got forgotten about.  It took about 15 minutes before someone, the hostess as it turns out noticed and apologized profusely.  We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and it was AH-MAZING!! When we received our appetizer and drinks and the gal told us the appetizer was on the house and again appologized for the delay in not getting to us sooner.  I don't have a problem with people making mistakes, we all do... what I care about as a customer is how you handle dealing with the mistske.  The staff was EXEMPLARY, appologized appropriately, made no BS excuses,  offered the free appetizer and extremely attentive service after that.  I ordered the prime rib sandwhich and my wife ordered the fish & chips.  Borh were very good!!  We were both delighted with the food and service.  Pleasantly pleased!"}
{"text":"I love the Vegetarian Burger they make here! So delicious! A really good menu and a very nice atmosphere! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I saw this place yesterday because it's next to my new nail spot, Ken's (highly recommend) I went back home and scooped up the fiance to come back here for a nice leisurely Sunday lunch....What an excellent choice! Service was great and very informative and attentive (didn't get the blonde servers name) We started off with a ceasar salad and it was delish.. I got the meatloaf meal and it was awesome!  Really delish...my only regret was that I wish we would have shared it...it's huge and well worth it. My fiance got the peppers and sausage mac and cheese...although delicious, it was scarce on the peppers and bell pepper. Cute cute spot and has nice patio area too.. A new spot for us for sure.."}
{"text":"I found this place as I was parking to go to Flower Child on St. Patty's Day (as you may guess, my St. Patty's Day wasn't very exciting). I feel like I've thoroughly searched through the Arcadia area on Yelp, so I was surprised to find that the place had character and looked super inviting from the outside but yet it'd never come up in any of my searches.   As soon as I got home, I pulled up Wally's on Yelp and made a note to go there ASAP.  Wow! What a hidden gem within \"trendy\" Arcadia. The inside is quaint, casual, and inviting and outside there's seating on their patio that is adorned with bistro lights.   The staff was very friendly, and the food was excellent! We came in on the tail end of happy hour on a Sunday afternoon. I've attached the HH menu, but overall, some great deals on apps and beer. We went with wings and beer to start (excellent btw), and for dinner, I went with the reuben and my fiance went with the fish and chips (see pics). My reuben was okay but did not come out the traditional sandwich that I was craving..It was filled with ginormous pieces of brisket and was on something that resembled a po' boy bun..not Rye. Somewhat of a let down but not all was lost - I loved the shoestring fries as a side. My fiance loved the fish and chips - no complaints there!  Overall, I really loved this spot and can't wait to try it out again. Arcadia lacks this sort of casual bar/restaurant and though my fiance and I were probably the youngest in there (we sat next to a party of 8 who were 60+), the atmosphere and comfort food menu (i want to try out more items) will definitely bring us back in."}
{"text":"My family and I are die-hard fans.  A trip to Phoenix is not complete unless we can eat dinner at Wally's at least once.  I highly recommend the pot roast, which is so tender.  Also, the iced tea is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Local to the area folks really like it, but I find the food very average and extremely boring. Very forgettable. I do remember I had a Cobb Salad last month, and it was average, and I couldn't even remember more. It shouldn't be like that."}
{"text":"Great 1st time experience.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly.  We enjoyed the 3-6 happy hour menu.  Food was excellent!  We came from Cave Creek and will come again!  Worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  Everyone we had dinner with had been there before except my son and I.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  The others we were with said hey have never had a bad meal here.  I had the chicken Vesuvius (not sure if I spelled that right).  Sooo good!  Really great portions and prices were reasonable.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really cute upbeat atmosphere  Great food; especially the chicken brie panini  Great attentive service.  If you get garlic toast ask for it crispy or else it may come out doughy inside."}
{"text":"Wow! My first trip to Wally's .... and I got to meet Wally! Neat-O!   Not only is he the bees knees he was hands on. I was, quite frankly, surprised by that. But more on that in a minute!  To frame my experience, I popped in on a Tuesday night during the dinner rush. One of our friends had hopped on over ASAP to nab a table. (Apparently this place is hopping. She was spot on!)  It's a really cute place that is friendly to all sorts of different folks.   If you want to watch the game? Sure! TV at the bar.  Feel like eating at the bar? Yep! Casual dining? Absolutely. Dinner date (where you want to impress)? YES.   I was (not on a date) but did see a number of couples engaged in serious conversation over wine. It's not too loud of a place (at least on a Tuesday night) to foster intimate conversation.   For dinner I followed the menu's guidance (and then asked Wally himself). Chicken Vesuvius is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l! Chicken medallions, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, 'cider' smoked bacon (HOH MY) with plenty of herbs and spices. My meal was served with a hearty portion of salad and (HOH MY) horse radish mashed potatoes.  1) The chicken was cooked to perfection. Not a hint of dryness! 2) The chicken wasn't bathed in oil. That sounds like a terrible way to describe it, but, I didn't feel like I was tossing a gym session out the window.   That being said, note that portions are on the very [very] generous side. I took 2/3rd of it home.  Right. So about Wally, the impeccable service and a delightful experience... Let's see...Our server described the specials with such delight that I only wished I was going off menu. But no! I wanted something \"regular\" on the menu. Wally was incredibly helpful in helping this first timer navigate the full menu. (Alas, the house was out of the nightly special of ribs.) Wally has a comedic sense of timing. Watch out!  Ok, so what's the deal with Wally's fantastic beard? Were you thinking Ernest Hemingway? Why yes! In fact, Wally and his son enter a contest every year for the best E. Hemingway beard in FL.   [Drum Roll] They are 2013 crowned winners!  This is a great spot if you're popping in to AJ's. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Wally's on a day when I wanted to eat healthier--- let's just say, that day was shot I had to call for a do-over the next day.  But oh, my Wally Burger was good!   Very laid back and easy going, I will return.  It's been awhile, but I will return.   We sat on the patio and I really enjoyed the casual-ness.  It's hidden, so you  have to go look for it.  44th/Camelback on the NE corner shopping center.   See you there!"}
{"text":"Great salad dressing, wonderful escargot appetizer with blue cheese, scrumptious Prime Rb, with marvelous mashed potatoes and great gelato. You can't beat this place for food, value, service, and ambiance."}
{"text":"I have been twice for happy hour. All their burgers are $7 during this time. I had one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had and definitely the best in the valley. My next visit I had the escargot with bleu cheese and it was delicious! I only wish the bread it was served with had been toasted otherwise it was perfect. I can't wait to visit the Gainey Village location."}
{"text":"The location is prime and the decor is neat, but the staff is horrendous! From the second we walked in we were treated as second class. The greeting with the hostess was odd but when the lack of communication continued things just felt uncomfortable. Severs would come to the table to drop something off or fill water, after saying thank you they'd look at me and turn walking away without saying a word. We noticed that it wasn't just one ill trained associate but every person there refused to say 'your welcome' or even acknowledge my expression of appreciation. We came to the conclusion that they must literally train their employees this way because every person in the establishment treated us this way. We paid with separate checks, and to top it off they charged the wrong cards. Meaning they literally had to take the card out of the opposite bill fold and charge it to the wrong check.   They seem to cater more toward the older crowd, as staff seemed extremely friendly with these patrons. The fact that we are both under the age of 40 seemed to have contributed to our poor treatment.   I can assure you I will not be returning and I urge you to save yourself an awful experience and dine or drink somewhere else as well!"}
{"text":"Where everybody knows your name.  Very refreshing to be waited on by Wally himself, I'll come back for the we serve mostly \"regulars\" feeling you get.  I don't think enough people know about this place but those that do come back for more.  The Cuban is my lunch of choice and the beer selection is perfect for happy hour."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at Wally's because at Wally's, regulars are family.  Beyond the deep, deep personal connection I have with the restaurant I can tell you that the food is unquestionably great and the service is always top-notch. (There are a few servers and bartenders who have been there since the place opened 10 years ago.)   My favorite menu items are as follows: 1) Cuban Panini 2) Frisco Burger 3) Meatloaf 4) Pot Roast 5) Spaghetti. The fact that Wally's can do all five of those things extremely well should tell you all you need to know.  There is something old school cool about a joint where the Proprietor is almost always present and Wally's is that place. He's the guy with the grey hair and beard who probably handed you your menu. Tell him I said hello and that the Price family loves him like their own."}
{"text":"First time here at Wally's! I got a bacon cheddar burger and my dad got a Havana Cuban sandwich ! So good! I personally wasn't a fan of the sweet potato fries, but was very happy with the meal also loved the atmosphere. Although our waitress was visibly irritated with the kitchen timer. Kind of a downer. But great place!"}
{"text":"YUM!  We live 45 minutes away from here and still have to come at least 1-2 times a month.  Good prices, fresh food, great tastes!  The blue plate specials are awesome.   Prime Rib is always on point!"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger S'mac is THE BOMB. Granted, it's the only thing I've tried there so far but I am going to be back for more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in this restraurant recently where my husband has been to to watch sports but this was my first visit. We don't live close but we will definitely make the trip back soon. I had the prime rib special and it was flavorful and tender. My husband had the liver since I won't cook it. He enjoyed his meal as well.    We found the staff professional but very friendly and the service excellent and quick."}
{"text":"Group of 6 popped in on a busy Friday night at 7:00.... Never been here before. Greeted like we were old friend and we were told a table could be found in a few minutes. We complicated it by asking for a table with a view of the TV for the baseball game viewers in the group. Wow... Seated within 4 minutes and lovely server who knew the menu well took great care of us. Highlights.... Everyone loved what they got... Onion soup, yum-o, s-Mac n cheese... Had the Gruyere and bacon version, wow! Would definitely order again and drive out of our way for it!  Pot roast.... Great atmosphere, reasonable prices, great service and great food.  Yay!"}
{"text":"This has been on my \"to try\" list for ages. We live down the street, we need a watering hole, and most importantly one that allows dogs. We found it. I almost don't want to shout out the rave reviews too loudly because it's so cool and I don't want to attract any uncool-ness with rave reviews. But I do want to give props to a terrific establishment.  The interior is beautiful, I love the lofty feel over the bar. The crowd was a nice mix and good representation of our Arcadia hood. Not too rowdy, not too stiff. The ambiance was set up very well, with a little sports flair but casual dining as well away from TVs.  The waitstaff is attentive and genuine. The food was above-average pub fare with plenty of veg options for us meatless mongers. The only minus was that while the patio allows dogs, not ALL areas of the patio are dog friendly according to our host. So we had to sit away from the bulk of table and couldn't sit under the heaters (which also apparently couldn't be moved). It was 50* out and pretty chilly, so I'll plan for that next time."}
{"text":"Wally's is great, been going there for years.  It is super-close to home and is consistently good.    It is indeed a \"pub n grill,\" just like the name says.  American food done well, a great bar, and the patio is the best.  Since it opened, Wally's has been one of our regular spots.  Long live Wally's!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say.  Great atmosphere.  Good Pub style food.  Cold drinks and a cantankerous owner!  My wife and I have been coming here for years and they always do a great job.    Food is consistently excellent with good portions and the fries are always perfect.  Wally's son Matt has been hosting the place more lately, so be sure to ask him why he's so much less cantankerous than his old man?  It's nice to see a family business do well as they all work hard every time you walk in the door to make sure you're welcome and that you're happy with everything.  Cheers"}
{"text":"I come here when I know I want to have some really good food. I've been to this place quite a few times and every single time every meal I've ordered has been beyond flavorful and delicious. I often have a hard time choosing what I want to eat. They have a huge variety of food anywhere from sandwiches to pasta to steak. It's priced perfect for the quality and quantity you're given. Every single staff member here is friendly, and they go above and beyond to make sure you're having a pleasant experience while dining there. This is overall the best restaurant in Phoenix. (I would highly recommend the meatball sandwich or a Wally burger)"}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be better than it was based on reviews. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. The burgers were just \"ok\" - nothing special and nothing great. Actually, both my husband and I ordered the bacon cheese burger and BOTH of us originally thought they had forgotten the cheese. It ended up being there, but was such a small amount that you couldn't even taste it. Our daughters had the chicken fingers, which were pretty good, but also not anything phenomenal. Probably the best part of the meal were the sauces. The BBQ sauce on my burger (I got it \"rodeo style\" - with BBQ and onion strings) was really tasty, and the ranch that the chicken was served with was delicious. Tasted really fresh and homemade - they should bottle and sell that stuff! The burgers? Meh - I could take it or leave it. Certainly not worth a special out-of-your-way trip or anything."}
