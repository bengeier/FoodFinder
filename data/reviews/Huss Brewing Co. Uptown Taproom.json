{"text":"If you get Fritz as your server, you're in great hands: very knowledgable, very chill, offers excellent pairings with foods and good descriptives. Fun atmosphere, great variety of brews. Surprisingly good Caprese salad with a slight unique twist that still stays true to the classic. Devilled eggs like you had when you were a kid. Easy, great tasting, fun, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Fantastic creamy milk stout was a highlight of our evening here. Sliders were terrific as well."}
{"text":"Been going there since opening bad beer tonight first time they charged me and didn't care bye"}
{"text":"Love this place. Cereal bar with Sunday football is a great idea! However, I'm not sure how you can expect to legitimately get people in for football on a Sunday if you don't have the NFL ticket. I was hyping cereal bar w/ football to my friends and anyone who would listen and then we went there this morning and they had one game on, so we left...very disappointing! Now I feel kind of stupid for hyping their cereal bar and football Sundays."}
{"text":"Great raspberry wheat beer ! Stopped in before my flight back home to Chicago and loved this ambiance and the beer ! Food is great too"}
{"text":"Even though they dissed my \"That 'll Do\", all the beer they have to offer is worth the visit. I have mailed over 3 cases to the likes of New York, Louisiana, Florida, Alaska promoting the flavorful options. Everyone of the staff at the Uptown location is friendly and attentive.
Come for the beer and enjoy the great food.
When you go give shout out to Mike, Cassie, Yoshi, Ruby, Jordan, Fritz, Bring, and the gang.
Happy One Year 4/14/2018."}
{"text":"Fun and friendly beer spot. Great beer, great menu. Tried a tasting board and enjoyed them all, however the roshambeaux and the orange blossom were table favorites. 
Giant pretzel with \" magic \" cheese and a meat and cheese board made for a tasty visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic array of different style beers, and all of them are outstanding. Can't beat $6 pitchers of their craft beer during happy hour! Combine that with being able to bring in a Lou Malnati's pizza or Shake Shack burger from next door, and there is absolutely no better deal in town."}
{"text":"You want to like them, the service is amazing and the food is good, but unfortunately the beer sucks! My husband and I tried the green chili sliders. They were awesome! Our stout sucked. They have an amazing happy hour where pitchers are 6 bucks. We literally sampled every beer. Coconut sunscreen with rancid Starbucks to rotten raspberries. We ended up with the same pitcher of crap we started with. Nasty beer but it's so cheep and the service is so good. I also recommend the pork sliders. You can also get take away ( this place is so amazing, just improve your sucky beer offerings!"}
{"text":"Really nice place to stop in and try a flight of their delicious brew! Happy hour has the best 32oz pitcher prices. Clean and airy with the music not too loud to still enjoy."}
{"text":"We love going to Huss when visiting family in Phoenix. Great location in the bustling uptown section of Phoenix, with lots of new shops and restaurants nearby. Great looking small brewery with roll up doors onto patio. Modern and bright. Quiet, relaxing patio area with umbrellas and misting system to keep you cool. Very good, attentive service provided by friendly, clean cut, polite, helpful staff. Very clean. We love the Coconut Joe and Orange Blossom beers that were kept when Huss took over Papago Brewing. Glad they kept these favorites on. Great place to hang out."}
{"text":"This huss location just opened and we have been waiting to come and check it out. Let me tell you it is a must visit.  First off it is a much needed tap room I this area. The beers are fantastic,  I particular the that'll do IPA is a must have. Service was also A+ for our experience."}
{"text":"With a great happy hour, great craft beer and super friendly staff this place is a winner. However limited food options is a drawback and the corner site in the center makes it hard to find. Parking is shared by AJ's and adjacent restaurants so forget a close by spot."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that Huss opened a location in the Uptown Plaza! They have great Huss beers on tap and a select few beers in the bottles, including a Lagunitas Aunt Sally sour. They are now serving food and it looks delicious! The service is quick to take your order. Overall, great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Was going to have dinner here but when we got inside, we could barely have a conversation it was so loud.  Would have sat outside but the patio had no shade.  So we had one drink at the bar and went elsewhere to eat.   Bartender was friendly.  Would have liked to give a better review but this was my experience."}
{"text":"Went for a beer at 8:30 pm, half hour before it closed. Good beer, nice tender, loved the outdoor tables with heaters. I had Copper State IPA. Other exotic beers were tasty."}
{"text":"Our first time visit was during 2018 AZ Beer Week. The tap takeover was a great selection. Huss brewing consistently has some excellent beers. This location is absolutely adorable with a green belt area, outdoor seating, and some super cute restaurants around it. I have to tell you that the black bean nachos were probably the best nachos I have ever had. The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and the service is at least somewhat adequate. Attempted to walk in around 850 for a beer after work with my fianc√© and were met at the front door with an abrupt \"we're closed\" while two other people sat at the bar. Kind of weird for a Thursday, definitely didn't leave a good taste in our mouth especially with the sign that says \"open until *at least* 9pm.\" We weren't looking to rage by any means!

The beers are ok and we love supporting local businesses, but will stick to the ones that want our patronage."}
{"text":"Huss brewing was one of my best experiences at a brewery tasting room ever. The bartender Yoshi was super knowledgeable and friendly. Gave us great recommendations on beer and told us a lot about the brewery and the area. If every bartender was like Yoshi world peace would be attainable. The beers were also amazing from the orange blossom to the koffee kosch. I would recommend Huss to even my non-beer loving friends. My girlfriend and I are totally returning to Huss"}
{"text":"Very small, cute atmosphere, great beer and T-shirts. Great food options the sausage board was amazing. Service needs to be improved dramatically. When we asked about the sausage, the waiter seemed put out his way to respond and give us the details."}
{"text":"Great beers and staff. They have a beer for everybody's taste. My fav was coco Joe. You can get a flight of 4 for $8 which is a great deal. I came here on a Saturday for some day drinking and it got quite busy. For food wise, we tried the roast beef sliders which was very tasty and they came with chips. They have no wait staff only bar service so I recommend to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Fun, new tasting room at Camelback & Central!  Friendly staff, nice selection of beer and food and laid back atmosphere.  I enjoyed the kumquat beer and my husband tried a flight of four different beers accompanied by a giant pretzel with the amazing beer cheese - so delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the bartender does a fantastic job keeping everyone interested and informative about what's new on tap. Happy hour is a great deal as well. The only problem is a waitress with a rude attitude, slow service and does give a shit what you have to say."}
{"text":"We came for a dink before our dinner date at St.Francis across the street. Everyone was really friendly and we scored seats at the bar. They had a ton of local beers on tap and the bartender allowed us to taste as many as we wanted. I had a beer that tasted like a Moscow mule, yum! At first the service was a bit slow buttttttt he made up for it by charging my boyfriend for a half pint when he received a fullll pint! They had a little joke going and then we were surprised when we got the bill. I only give 4 stars bc I didn't get to taste the food! I'll update after that!"}
{"text":"Amazing service they are all very knowledgeable!  Amazing beer selections! Can't ask for more from a tap room in a great location!!"}
{"text":"From a great ambiance to a great knowledgeable staff, our experience was awesome! We always have beer in the fridge from Huss but having a place to get great beer and great service, makes the beer taste that much better!"}
{"text":"Very chill environment. Good food. Good service. A little loud and a little small. Random but the bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"My family came here for dinner.  I have a limited diet to avoid irritants, like fried food (chips), wheat and dairy.  It's pretty much impossible to eat here if you can't have wheat and dairy.

Most brewpubs and gastropubs will have at least ONE thing on the menu for folks who have to follow a strict diet.  Not Huss.  If you're lucky enough to own an iron gut then I guess you could come here for food.  But vegetarians, vegans and other people who have to avoid dairy or wheat, eat before you show up."}
{"text":"Cool place. Good beer. Great happy hour prices with $6 pitchers and $2 sliders. can't beat the price"}
{"text":"We went to Huss for the first time on Friday night, and it's my favorite brewery I've been to in a long time! We got there with about an hour left of happy hour and it was packed. We had to wait a little bit for a table, but they were nice enough to let us get a pitcher for the happy hour price while we waited. 

For food, we tried one of each of their sliders, and all of them were amazing! I'd highly recommend them. After we were done, we ended up ordering two more because they were so good - and they let us get two more in on the happy hour price with only a minute or two left before it ended. 

We also tried a flight with four of their beers - Coconut Joe, Magic in the Ivy, Nitro Milk Stout and Red Swole DIPA - and liked them all :) if you like coffee or chocolatey beers, you'll probably like the Coconut Joe. The bartenders were also incredibly nice and very fast and attentive. We'll for sure be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service impeccable. What more can you ask. We will definitely come back! There are so many dishes I want to try. Oh and the cocktails were spot on. Almond margarita rock."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a perfectly executed example of a local brewery tasting room, you'll find it here at Huss.  It's brand-spanking new and boasts a comfortable decor and vibe.

The bartender was great and I was able to order half pours of a couple of different Huss beers.  The beer was fresh and tasty!  I particularly liked the Swole Red IPA brewed in collaboration with Arizona Cardinal Jared Veldheer.

They also have a small food menu which I'll try on my next visit."}
{"text":"The orange blossom and Scottsdale blonde are great beers! I recently went to check out the new Huss location and it's really nice! It has a fun atmosphere and with an indoor/outdoor feel too."}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken a picture of the pork sliders. They looked nothing like the photos we saw in yelp. We could barley see any meat. It looked like three buns in a plate. We also ordered the jalape√±o poppers. Again food looked nothing like the pictures on yelp. Tip - take advantage of their offer to order from a near by restaurant. The beer was ok. Three stars is for the very nice server."}
{"text":"It was really great service ,and the flight of beers was delicious and all the appetizer cold cut plate was very good bartender very friendly great Service"}
{"text":"I dig this place.  Just a nice place to hang out. Very contemporary and clean. The beers are solid and the staff is cool.  
Check out their happiest hour!
A pitcher for six bucks!!"}
{"text":"I've been here once before to try out a flight of beer. I loved the fun selections they had- coconut, koffee kolsch, milk stout... all very good. My favorite was the nitro milk stout but I liked all of them tbh. 
I returned and tried their flatbread (a relatively new item on their menu?) and it did not disappoint! Very thin bread with much flavor! Much like a thin-and-crispy-crusted pizza! 
The atmosphere was perfect for a lazy and chilled afternoon. Not too crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Super great as a post-hike spot. Service was quick and perfect. One of my favorite spots, for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour or gathering before an event. Only beer and wine but great hard cider on tap too! The sliders are outstanding and if you come at happy hour they are $2, pitchers of select beer $6. Great friendly staff and locally owned!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer and awesome food! Definitely check this place out during happy hour for 6 dollar pitchers and 2 dollar sliders!!! We did a half and half pitcher with half koffee kolsch and half coconut joe and it was AMAZING. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While I liked the flight of beers I tried at Huss, I have to say that Huss has some of the sweetest beers I've ever tasted.  It actually could be good for someone who usually orders a glass of Riesling wine but now is trying to get into the craft beer game.  

Oh, and bonus points for the outdoor patio and the branding.  I like what you've got going, Huss!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer and great location. Koffee koulsh is really smooth and has a great coffee flavor. Coconut Joe was great as well. The food menu is also really tasty. Check them out!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Very comfortable with indoor and outdoor seating options. We didn't eat, but the beers were really enjoyable. We will be back. 

Nitro Milk Stout (excellent)
Coconut Joe sweet Stout (great)
Koffee Kolsch (very good)
Orange Blossom Wheat (great)
Scottsdale Blonde Kolsch (very good)
Kumquat Kolsch (good)
Raspberry Wheat (excellent)
Magic in the Ivy west coast pale (okay)"}
{"text":"It's a small brewery with a small menu. I found the interior to be cozy with lots of tvs to watch games. They also had a few games to choose from to play with friends. I really liked that they sold the beers on the menu to take home. I enjoyed all the beers and ciders I tried. I had read a few reviews before going and tried the koffe kolsch and was glad I did. We had their nachos and added the pork to them and they were amazing. The jalepeno poppers were also enjoyable. The only reason I gave them 4/5 was because the service was not up to par. I would come again in hopes of not having the same server."}
{"text":"Love this new location! It's spacious, bright, and has plenty of parking. I came on a Saturday afternoon and it was popping! We grabbed a shared high table. We ordered a couple of pitchers of the IPAs - Magic in the Ivy and Cooper State (I loved them both!). For food we ordered the stuffed jalape√±o poppers and the black bean nachos. The nachos were amazing! Easily some of the best nachos I have ever had. We didn't add the green chili pork to them, as we had a vegetarian in the group, but I want to come back and try them with the pork!"}
{"text":"You can't beat $6 pitcher for HH!

The first couple of times I've visited Huss Brewing the service has below average. The very first time our pitchers never came out and there was more than one server assisting us at the time. It got messy and long story short - they thought we were lying about not receiving our beers. The next visit was a little better but the service still sucked. 

My friends and I gave them another visit a couple times after that because you just can't beat the prices they have for HH and the location is very convenient. The service was better the next times we went.

Chips + dip, caprise sliders, and deviled eggs are among the few food items I've tried. All of them were up to par."}
{"text":"Great food and AMAZING local beer! The pretzel with beer cheese is the best. My personal favorite beer is the Magic in the Ivy but they offer flights so you can sample & find your own favorite! Insider tip: Try a combo of the Coconut Joe and the Koffee Kolsch ;)"}
{"text":"Really creative beer list. 
Coffee kolsch...really good coffee nose and flavor but in a lighter beer. 
Coconut joe....a drinkable porter style with nice finish of coconut."}
{"text":"Fabulous service. There wasn't a single moment in our 3+ hour visit that any glass at the table was less than 1/3 full when someone asked if we needed another drink. Food was decent and the tap selection, excellent."}
{"text":"Have been trying to get here for a few weeks and finally made it. We love Huss and have visited the Tempe taproom.  Great addition to this area. Looking forward to coming back and hanging on the patio. Great service."}
{"text":"I've never felt so discriminated!  They sat us in the back corner after we asked to be seated in the from booth.  Without even asking us where we could sit they just sat us back there.  Not cool so sad"}
{"text":"Overall great experience for a happy hour. Service was very good and the beer choices were great. Had all three slider varieties and possibly the best I have ever had and for $2 they were a bargain.   This is a great addition to the neighborhood and I will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"Always relaxing. Nitro Stout is so creamy. Green Chile pork sliders or pretzel bites are the way to go."}
{"text":"As we all know the Koffee Kolsch is one of the most popular options and it's delicious. They do sell 24 beers here for $30 which is significantly less than what Total Wine charges.

They have some good appetizers and a variety of beers. They also allow you to bring in food from nearby restaurants if you want.

Plenty of outside tables with heaters if needed or plenty of seats inside as well."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this location since it opened, I am thrilled to have  brewery in Uptown! Cassie always takes great care of us, we truly feel a part of the Huss family with her! Grab a Scottsdale Blonde and sit on the patio, even bring over food from one of the neighboring joints. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Huss Brewing. The taproom offers friendly and helpful service, a great variety of beers to chose from, and very tasty food. They offer amazing deals on chips and salsa and sliders on happy hour and their flights are a no-brainer. The tap room is bright and very open, very modern and kind of industrial in it's decor and the bathrooms are always clean. I love this location, there is plenty of parking, and they have great hours. Just try it already!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and beers! This location is way better than the one in Tempe.  The space is opened and very trendy.  Nice spot to hang out and happy hour is great."}
{"text":"Nice brewery with a great selection of beers. $6 craft pitchers for happy hour is a great deal and they let you bring food in from outside. There is Lou Malnati's pizza and Shake Shack next door. They do have a small menu, I tried the soft pretzel and the onion dip and both were spot on. 

They were out of the can wines that I have been dying to try so I will have to go back and write an update."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Huss Brewing Co., though we have had their beer at other places. Great atmosphere and delicious beer. The beer menu is just right, not too many or too few options. I recently learned that they bought Papago Brewing so it was fun to see those beers on the menu as well. This is important to note because Papago has Coconut Joe and Huss Coffee Kolsch. When mixed together these two make a perfect summer drink!"}
{"text":"Great little brewery in the Uptown Plaza. It's tucked in the back but has a great patio/open concept. Their sliders are the best I've had and the beer selection is always fun."}
{"text":"If you are in the Uptown Plaza area, (Central and Camelback), check this place out.  The Happy Hour is a great deal. (Small pitchers are six dollars, and the sliders are two dollars each.)  Also, sixty-Four ounce growler refills are twelve dollars. (Unless you get their double  IPA-Ro-Sham Beaux)((That one will set you back twenty-two dollars.))  Terry was the manager, Yoshi was the bartender.  They were both extremely gracious and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Great vibe, service and yummy brews. The menu is small but perfectly orchestrated for beer pairing. We had their meat and cheese board and it was impressive. They don't have meals but welcome outside food from select restaurants if you are extra hungry. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Great little taproom in the AJ's strip mall off of Central. Great happy hour deal. Get your beer on here after you put your name on Lou Manatis waiting list."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful taproom. It was a big fight to get it opened, but it was well worth the effort. They have 24 wonderful beers on tap. Very friendly staff and an enjoyable spacious drinking area. They have a happy hour Monday through Friday from 3 to 6. They used have HH on the weekends but not any more."}
{"text":"In town for work and looking for a local brew pub, hopefully with good food and great beer.  Bingo!

I'm a hop head and so I gravitated towards the IPAs.  Copper State IPA, a thing of absolute beauty.  That'll Do IPA, wow hop heaven.

Was here at happy hour and ordered the trio of sliders - caprese, roast beef and green chile pork.  All fantastic.  And $2 each!  And if they don't have a menu item to your liking, you can order/bring food in from nearby restaurants.  Cool.

Friendly, efficient staff.  Great vibe and patio.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome location and I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's not closer to my house!   I've lived a short bicycle ride distance away from Huss's original brewing facility and have dreamed of the day there would be food on the menu as well great beer.

Uptown Taproom is that and more.  With a great food and beer menu and a very cool location, anyone who has enjoyed the great local flavors of Huss Brewing at their Tempe location will be blown away by the Uptown Tavern.

Maybe the next Huss Taproom will land in Ahwatukee!?!"}
{"text":"I'm a beer lover and a huge fan of HUSS Brewing, especially their Koffee Kolsch, which tastes just like if a smooth brewed coffee and beer had a baby and decided to have a party in your mouth. I felt like the luckiest gal in the world when they opened their second taproom up the street from me in Uptown Plaza! We came in on a weekday and ordered a beer flight. The beers of course, did not disappoint. They also carry Papago Brewing Co. and we enjoyed the Papago Coconut Joe as well as their red ale and IPA. Even though it's newly opened, the taproom has a bright, open vibe that's perfect for an after work drink.
The menu is mostly small bites and shareable plates, but their \"Noble Toast\" looked appealing. HUSS bakes the bread for 36 hours and uses organic ingredients to put on top of it, and though I didn't get to try it this time, I will definitely be back for that.
My only gripe with HUSS is that it's a little overpriced in my opinion. The \"Noble Toast\" is $8-$10, boards are between $13-14 and our flights were $3-4 for smaller pours that looked to be 2oz. Usually when I order a flight from other beer establishments, it comes out to a little less than ordering a regular 12oz, or at least giving me more beer for my bucks. Not the case here. With Sun Up, Central Ale, and Rott n' Grapes not far from HUSS, I would think twice about coming here if my intention is to get the most bang for my buck. In addition, I would encourage more beer loving gal pals to come out there. While I was there, no lie, I was the only woman besides the bartender in the establishment (see picture). 
If you do decide to check it out, don't forget to order their Koffee Kolsch!"}
{"text":"We had no problem stopping in at Huss when there was a 45 minute wait at Malnati's next door. Our stay ended up being being 3 hours spent sampling a good majority of the beers while still getting to have some Chicago deep dish.

This taproom is great spot to just chill and drink some beer with plenty of space indoors and fresh air circulating with open garage doors. If you're hungry, they have a one page menu divided into sharables, sliders, and boards. We didn't order anything off the menu, but we were able to order a pie from next door and Huss provided the plates and silverware. You are free to order from your favorite establishments nearby and have it delivered.

As for the beers on tap, almost all are Huss beers with a few Papago Brewery thrown in. If you're looking for beers with knock you on your butt, high alcohol content, and strong hoppy bites, you probably won't find them here. The double citra IPA Ro Sham Beaux checks in as the strongest I saw with 8.3% ABV and 104 IBU's. The majority of the beers tend to run lower alcohol and IBU's which some might dare to classify as watered down. But I had no problems with any of the beers because they had three stouts on tap, including a nitro and a barrel. After my flight, I stuck with the barrel aged coffee stout. You can't go wrong with a coffee flavored stout with whiskey lurking in the background.

There was one bartender working the Saturday night we were there. She was friendly and helpful throughout. But a pet peeve I have from my experiences working is not being able to keep the bar top clean especially after removing a glass or after a customer has left leaving wet spots and dried condensation. I had to stare at these areas the whole night."}
{"text":"Great new location for a great brewery! Excited to see what special and limited beers they carry throughout the year. If you like coffee, they make some of the best coffee beers I've ever had. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"The beer was great here no question about that. The service was also good. We were greeted and served by more than one person which I kind of liked because we never had to wait for anything. 
The coconut stout and the coffee Kolsh are by far my favorite beers at his place.

It was kind of crowded because they were hosting some kind of meet and greet event with a bunch of ladies. I really hope they charged a lot for them to do this because all of those women weren't drinking and they were making the rest of the customers suffer with all of their short selling and beauty makeovers. I got hair spray in my mouth while drinking because of the makeovers ... yuck! 
I would think again before hosting events like that in such a small space. Other than this everything was quite nice"}
{"text":"Came in for a beer and those were good. The space is also nice and trendy. The service? Bleh...

We were told that happy hour runs till 5:00 with $6 pitchers the same as a pint.  So we went that route only to find our bill showing a $10 charge. When brought to servers attention we were told it was because order was placed at 5:03.  Not the biggest of deals but I've never been somewhere that a server wouldn't change it...and Huss is that place. 

Also don't waste $$ on the meat & cheese board. It was laughable.  

It's a shame cause there are so many paces to get good local beer and now Huss won't be one of them."}
{"text":"Mixed emotions on this place. I love the beer and I went right after it opened but the experience in the tap room wasn't great. It was packed (which I guess means most people like it) and so loud in there. It might just be the acoustics of the building but I was with a friend sitting at a table and we couldn't hear each other talking. I'm not against loud places, but I am against a loud overcrowded tap room. If I'm going to a tap room I want to be able to talk at a reasonable level and enjoy a few beers. The food menu was limited when I went, but they let you bring in outside food, which I thought was cool. I'll always order Huss beer at other restaurants, I just probably won't go back to the taproom."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour,  6$ cannot beat it,  great atmosphere , the cheese board was good , I recommend to pick up something to bring in with you if your looking for snack or dinner since they do not offer a selection at the location. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable,  highly recommend checking this place out."}
