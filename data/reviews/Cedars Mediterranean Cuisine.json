{"text":"I love this restaurant!!!!  The food is amazing!
The owners are very friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Wow! You have got to try Cedars! I just had the Beef Swarma - spiced beef tips over rice with homemade tziki sauce. Every morsel of beef was tender and flavorful. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is unbelievable, fresh, homemade what a gem real food not some microwaved provision food. If  Cedars were in Pittsburgh you would wait for a table. Found Cedars on Yelp as we were traveling through  now we come weekly though 45 minute drive. Large menu and portions and the staff are so welcoming and care about their customers. If you like mid eastern food this is the place to come and if you have never tried it come here first you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!!! It is fresh, different and true Mediterranean.  We are happy to be back. We had the Mujaddara, Lebanese salad, baba ghanouge and the Spicy Chicken.  Every time we pick a new dish, it becomes our favorite. And most of the time, we eat it all.  Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the simplicity of the place after all you want the food.Found this little Lebanese restaurant by accident. I have eaten Lebanese food in Lebanon and at many restaurants in around the world. This place is  very authentic. It reminds me of my mother's Lebanese cooking and a good she was ...I drive 45 minutes to eat their Baba ganoush., Kafta , rice ,and okra., the falafel is nice and moist. I heard that the chicken kebab is goo too. They also make home made yogurt.  And save room for the rice pudding ..."}
{"text":"Had lunch at cedars food was super.  Hummus was to die for. Had the chicken skewers, salad and the hummus. All was super
       Russ and Rose Taylor"}
{"text":"I went for lunch. The service was prompt and the food was great.  The lunch menu was very affordable. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Pittsburgh from Seattle I make it a point to stop here for lunch or dinner. The food is delicious. I enjoy their Gyro Plate and other Lamb options. They have almond, pistachio, and cashew baklava in addition to their traditional baklava. We had the almond and traditional, and will probably order a pan for New Years Eve."}
{"text":"Get into this place !!  It's a hidden gem (back corner of the building, behind Atrias).  Empty restaurant at 6:30p on a Tue night but don't let that fool you. Broad menu and tasty.  I'm not a local and travel a lot. Family owned and operated, this place is excellent. Patronize them, Canonsburg, or they will leave and that would be a loss."}
{"text":"All homemade Mediterranean food. We split a kebab platter - plenty of food, excellent value. The chicken kebabs were delicious. The platter included many sides, some I had never tried before. We liked everything. The rice pudding was fresh and homemade.
Nice people.
BYOB.
Casual."}
{"text":"Very friendly waiter and chef. Food was great. No complaints about my chicken and my wife loved the lamb. The hummus at the start was better than anything we've had in a long time. Cheap place to eat some good Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are always so nice and the food is delicious. Spicy (if you want it) and super flavorful without adding excess fat or salt. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I found this gem when just doing a simple search for restaurants in the area. We have been a few times now, tried a lot of things, and EVERYTHING is great. You can tell that they take pride in this place. The food is 100% authentic unlike a \"Mediterranean\" chain that's also in the area. The service has been lovely every time. They don't mind helping you navigate their menu if you are unfamiliar with any of the choices. Prices are totally fair for the quality and amount of food you get. Happy to have this place so close!"}
{"text":"Being pretty dead at 7pm made us second guess, but it proved to be good food and a good time overall. We all loved our starters. Although no one was wowed by the entrees. They were good, but not great which is the reason for only 4 stars.

Get: awesome humus and babaganoush. Some of the best I've ever had. Group really liked the grape leaves."}
{"text":"Good food but just a poor value for lunch.

This place is located in the KMART shopping center, on the side of the building with Atria's. The parking spaces are labeled because of the pettiness of the shop owners and management. Surely one is just going to grab an available spot?

Everyone I encountered at Cedars was friendly and helpful.

There was one table at lunch time on a Monday.

Besides their $11-$12 salads, the main courses available are priced between $15 and $23, the Kabobs $13-$14, and Vegetarian $17-$19. I suppose you could order a couple large appetizers and be at $15, or a couple side dishes, but Cedars desperately needs a LUNCH MENU with LUNCH PRICES.

If you need matching examples within the same food genre within exactly the same area, look simply at Aladdin's which is a couple thousand feet away across Route 19.  They have a selection of Pitas $5.25-$8.25, salads from $7.45-$13, and larger plates for under $15.

Back to Cedars, I declined the spicy sauce that they suggested with my $16.95 lunch, but I'm glad I did, because that would have been another $5 upcharge.

I ate the Kafta with Lebanese Rice, ordered spicy. The rice was delicious, and the Kafta was very good. You got four Kafta rolls, done almost like breakfast sausage links, although a little larger. The flavors and spices were unique. The meal was just enough food for lunch --- I think two more would have been expected at that price.

The included salad is clearly an afterthought, and has iceberg lettuce, a couple pieces of chopped tomato, one tiny green olive with pit, and the tiniest sprinkle of feta. This is a waste of everyone's time.

Markook, another example of similar food, located about 7 miles South on Route 19, also has platters under $12 and wraps $7-$9.

Simple Greek, located 3 miles away, has huge portions of Gyro meat on Gyros and platters for reasonable prices.

Overall, I wish the prices at Cedars were more reasonable, matching the existing competition out there. The food is very good, but just a poor value, especially at lunch time.

I'd also suggest the owners visit Palmyra and/or Istanbul grille downtown for restaurants that are doing similar things for under $10-$12."}
{"text":"What a great find ! We really enjoy Mediterranean food and found this on Yelp. Great food and outstanding service. Not much decor, but food is what it was about. We enjoyed the tabbouli, grape levels, lamb chop and beef shawarma. Pistachio baklava was very tasty. Really enjoyed the rice as well.Only complaint was that dinner was brought too soon, before we had a chance to finish appetizers and salad. We were told everything was made fresh, and it tasted like it. Will definitely go back. Location was not visible, but go to Kmart plaza and its around the corner from Atrias."}
{"text":"Come to Pittsburgh a couple times a year and we tend to eat here on every visit.  Super friendly and accommodating.   Tea is delicious.  All the food is consistently great."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Cedars. It was my husband's first visit and can't wait to go back. The hummus was smooth and creamy. He had the grilled lamb chops and I had the spicy chicken. Both were flavorful. The cashew baklava and the almond baklava were good too. We brought a bottle of wine. The server was attentive and eager to please us. This is a must try place!"}
{"text":"Strong local value with quality food. The chicken kabob is STELLAR.  A great portion of food for the price.  Always prepared in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"The service was quick, with a friendly smile. Tabouli was excellent. I am a fan of grape leaves with meat and they were good. The chicken kabob as our entree was very juicy and full of flavor. I would  recommend the home made Laban. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean cuisine in the area. Hidden in the plaza around back from Atria's, don't miss out on this. Quiet environment for dining in, staff is friendly and quick. Recommend the chicken kabobs and homemade hummus"}
{"text":"My aunt recommended this place to me, so I went and got take out. The people that work there are VERY nice and eager for you to try their food. I got meatless grape leaves and a falafel sandwich that comes with a side of either hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, or rice pilaf. I got the baba. It was VERY good. Smokey and tangy. The grape leaves were standard cold leaves and I love them that way. And the sandwich was good too but I found it odd they put pickles on it, however, it worked well. I'd like to go back and try other dishes and the grape leaves with meat. The portions are also pretty large, which is nice! I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum.

We will definitely return to this little gem tucked behind Atrias. The owner/waitress was great and helped us pick out dishes. The baba ganoush was excellent; probably the best I have ever tasted. Very smooth. I thoroughly enjoyed the lamb chops that I ordered. 

I can't wait to return to try out more dishes."}
{"text":"We headed to Cedars for dinner the other night, cautiously hopeful that perhaps we had a winner in the land of bland. I can give a hesitant thumb up on on this place, which has the usual roster of Middle Eastern delights on the menu. I went with hummus bi tahini, stuffed grape leaves and their lentil soup. The hummus, served with that super thin pita, was tasty but a tad over salted. I would try it again, hoping that they use a lighter touch with the salt next time. The Calamata olive that garnished the dish was delicious, so I'd order a plate of these next time. The lentil soup tasted good but was the most unappetizing looking soup I've ever seen. They puree the lentils and add rice, so that the final result is a gray, amorphous mass. You eat with all your senses, so bad looking food can be a turn off. The stuffed grape leaves were good, although I thought the rule for grape leaves was if they're vegetarian, they're to be served cold, and if they're meat filled, serve them warm. I prefer veggie grape leaves served cold, and will ask for them like that next time I go in. My date ordered the baba ganoush, and it was excellent. It's a mixed bag here, with an equal number of winners and losers for me. I'll go and try more, as they offer chicken dishes, and they have a lunch buffet that I'm curious about. It says on their menu that they have a website, but it must not be up yet, as the link leads nowhere. They do have a facebook page."}
{"text":"We were looking for something different and thought we would try Cedars. Everything was wonderful the service the food! The lamb was so tender and flavorful served perfectly. The waitress was attentive and explained the menu. The place is little hidden but would go again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent Lebanese food, great service, very nice owners.  The spicy kafta kabob, red beans and baba ghanoush were delicious!  My wife and I have dined there several times and have not been disappointed.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy Mediterranean food and for those who've never tried it."}
{"text":"I got the chicken skewer with rice, a Greek salad, and also tried the hummus, all were more tasty than I even expected after reading all of the positive reviews. Definitely will return. The girl working was super helpful and nice in showing me the menu and specials as well"}
{"text":"Cedars is such a nice restaurant. 
We've been going here for a couple of years. It had been a few months since we had visited. We brought a bottle of wine and they provided the awesome food.
I'm a creature of habit, I have to start with Baba Ganoush and pita bread. Tonight we had lamb chops and a spicy chicken dish for my husband. Everything was awesome, owners are extremely attentive.
Baklava and Lebanese tea for dessert! 
Go have an amazing meal, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Best tabouli around! Everything here is beautifully made. And the grape leaves are almost as good as my grandmas."}
{"text":"Well I tried this place again. Still 5 Stars.  The dolmas was awesome. The Greek salad dressing was very good. I ordered the spicy Kafta, which ate logs of ground lamb and sirloin. It was awesome. I also had the Lebanese rice and spicy sauce. They were also great."}
{"text":"Loved the food. The decor is very plain, but seriously what kind of flavor does decor really add. Sometimes it just covers up bad food. Went to Cedar's Wednesday night with a friend. They were not busy, but there was a lot of in and out traffic for to go food. Our waitress was awesome and knew the menu. The chicken kabob was flavorful and moist and delicious. I wish I had realized it was a BYOB, but I didn't:(. Our waitress told us there is no corking fee and they provide you with glasses. Give these people some business. Inexpensive and delicious. My two favorite things about a restaurant!!"}
{"text":"the atmosphere is nonexistent but the place if clean, the staff friendly and most importantly the food is good - if you it there it's BYOB"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here since we were having issues with the electricity in our home (no oven, no stove, no microwave).  Decided on the chicken kabob, lamb shish kabob and small order of the baba ganoush.  I can't comment on the lamb since that was for my husband but the chicken was flavorful and you could tell the baba ganoush was made from scratch.  While the chicken was flavorful, I wish it had been a bit more tender/moist.  

I'd like to give dining in a try so I could eat the food fresh off the grill!  It's a small, unassuming place on the inside but if you're in the area I'd opt for this place rather than Atria's."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 5 star because of how great the owners and service was.
I was just browsing yelp to see what my mother and I were going to have for an early dinner and Mediterranean being her favorite I had a few options. I feel like I had saw an advertisement this morning on the TV for this place, but when we actually went in it did not relate to the images I saw on the commercial.
We were the only table eating which bummed me out, I figured it was because of their location being the last shop of the plaza hidden on the corner.
I did feel like entree prices were a little too much for me, but my red bean (mild) with a side of rice pilaf was exactly what I wanted. I loved it. 
Our waitress and her husband were just so friendly and at your service!"}
{"text":"The service and food are excellent.  I wish the location was a better (behind Atrias on 19) because the food is significantly better than Aladdin's which is across 19. It has that best Mediterranean food in the area. Although it is kid friendly, (our kids love the gyro plate,) it is also very quiet inside. I highly recommend the chicken and rice with pine nuts. Very well seasoned and very very well prepared.  Excellent grape leaves."}
{"text":"Was visiting family in town and came here based on the Yelp reviews...definitely a good choice! Great food, great prices, and quick, friendly service. It's not a fancy place by any means, but the food shines through. Had the hummus, gyro, and baklava, and all were delicious. Look forward to coming back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best dining experience. Service and food fantastic... Lovely lady explained everything and suggested items"}
{"text":"Great extensive menu. Friendly service. The best baba ghannoj I've ever had. A breath of fresh air in the chain restaurant heavy south hills. We've been hoping to find a place like this."}
{"text":"My first experience with Cedars was at coffee hour at my church. One of our parishioners brought a huge amount of hummus and baba ghanush, and it was some of the best dips I've ever had. Upon further inquiry, I knew I had to check this place out.
Don't be afraid of this conspicious restaurtant located in the back of McDowell Shops. It's hidden, the tables and decorations are pretty plain, and what's up with that tiny salad bar?? Even the menu's design is pretty ho-hum. However, the food makes up for all that lackluster ambiance.
The Mediterranean menu is filled with great apps like the hummus and baba ghanush, as well as kibbi, meat pies, and more, and continues on with a great kabob menu. Everything is fresh and prepared when ordered.
When my wife and I go, we've discovered that the best deal on the menu is the kebab plate for one (not two!). It comes with a choice of any two appetizers, stuffed grape leaves, stuffed cabbage, meat pie, and a kabob of your choice with rice. It's a freaking ton of food for $15. We split it with another appetizer and it ends up being too much food or the both of us. 
Lunch is really cheap, but the rest of the menu is reasonably priced (don't tell the owners how cheap it is!). On Saturday's, they have lamb kibbi, which is raw ground lamb- and it's awesome!
This place really is a hidden gem. I think it's the best Mediterranean food I've had in the area. If you can find it :)"}
{"text":"This hidden gem in McMurray is great. Tucked into the side of a shopping plaza, Cedars is easily overlooked, but well worth finding. The hummus is some of the best we've had. The gyros and salads are outstanding. The owner/cook/host/ is friendly and actually appreciates your patronage, unlike a franchise or chain restaurant.  Highly recommend eating in or for take out."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!  The staff was even better than that. If you are afraid you may not like this type of food go to Cedars.  The staff provides expert guidance and we were super happy with everything we tried. The only regret is we weren't able to try everything on the menu. Oh, and their special homemade iced tea is to die for!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times. Good food presented by very nice people. If you enjoy this cuisine then I think you will enjoy Cedars.

No alcohol served, but you can BYOB."}
{"text":"Came with the 'rents for the lunch buffet. A good deal at $6.99/person. Everything was fresh. Pork and chicken skewers, grape leaves, tabbouleh and tahini all delicious.

Try the iced tea! It was an especially astute blend."}
{"text":"My wife and I split a Cedars platter for two. We definitely received more than enough for the two of us. The food was fabulous and both the regular and pistacio baklava were delicious.  Everything is homemade and highly enjoyable. The restaurant is located right around the corner from Atrias. Our gps had trouble finding it. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"You have GOT to visit this place!  Picked it randomly as we were driving through McMurray and didn't want a long wait on a Friday night.  This is the real deal Mediterranean venue.  Start with the hummus with meat and pine nuts, it'll knock your socks off.  Also, you may want a side order of the in-house made yogurt for some \"heat cutting\" during your main entree.  It reminds me a lot of sour cream but slightly different texture.  For dinner, I had the Kafka (sp?), which is 2 skewers of lamb/beef sausages, served with rice.  Keep in mind this dish does have some heat!  The place is kid friendly and has a cool gyro platter.  My son also was gobbling down the pita triangles, which were fresh and amazing.  It is sort of behind Atrias, and you cannot see it from the front of this plaza.  The server was a sweetheart (Rena) and her husband was doing the cooking.  Try it!!"}
{"text":"This is a new addition to the restaurant scene here in the South Hills.   I like this cuisine quite a bit but it isn't easy to pull off.  It's the kind of food that can go from great to awful in a heart beat.  The space is nice, the guys are too.  The menu is brief.  They offer table service but neither of the guys running it have front of the house experience.  I ordered water no ice and promptly got a glass filled with ice for example.  Small detail but here's the thing, they're missing the small details in the food too.  

The hummus had too much salt.  I heard the microwave door and timer repeatedly.  I do not go out so that someone can nuke my dinner.  There's no place for it, it robs your food of micronutrients and has nothing to do with healthy and freshly prepared food.  Listen up Panera!  I didn't try the lentil soup but I will warn you that it is the most unappetizing dish I have seen come out of a kitchen in some time.  I did love my baba ganoush.  The ground lamb/sirloin kabab was juicy and had a nice grilled flavor but was just passable and could have used a little more seasoning.   It sat on a bed of rice that was a bit greasy, cold and needed a bit of seasoning.   I think they microwaved the soup, grape leaves (vegetarian are usually served cold) and rice.  

The prices are low so maybe they're aiming low.  I saw an iceberg lettuce salad that looked a little sad on my way out.  This isn't good enough for me."}
{"text":"Overall the food was good but nothing exemplary. The falafel balls were a little too dry and the hummus was tasteless. The menu is great though; there's a huge variety and selection of food and the service is wonderful. I was happy to try it but I don't know if I would come back by choice."}
{"text":"Hospitable, welcoming, friendly, delicious are all adjectives which describe Cedar's Mediterranean Cuisine adequately. 

To say I eat at Cedar's on a regular basis is...an understatement. 

There aren't many items on the menu which I haven't eaten. All of which are truly exceptional.

These are the staples that must be eaten at Cedars:

Chicken Kebab, always carefully seasoned and expertly cooked. Out of the dozens I've eaten, never a dry one. Always perfect.

Kafta Kebab, same as above. Delicious. Juicy, Adequately Seasoned. Someone below once said that it tasted like hamburger. Lady, you're nuts. Again, I've ate dozens of them. No hamburgers here. 

Tabouli. Outrageous. It's wet, adequate parsley(flat leaf, of course), white onion, tomato, bulghur, lemon, salt and pepper. The absolute best. No Med restaurant in the Pittsburgh area makes it better. 

Baba Ganoush, smokey, smooth, delicious.

Yogurt, delicious. You shouldn't be allowed to eat at Cedars unless you get the yogurt. It elevates anything you put it on. Rice, proteins, etc. Delicious. 

Spicy Chicken, Spicy Kafta, Spicy Chicken Taouk. All delicious. 

Desserts. Several different baklava choices. All home made. All delicious. Not all are available at all times though. 

The folks that own Cedars are wonderful people that will make you an excellent meal and they are gracious for your business. 

I'd also like to note, a lot of people say their restaurant is \"spartan\" or boring, or what have you. Here's what matters: Delicious Food, CLEAN, excellent service."}
{"text":"This little place is tucked in on the side of a shopping plaza. We've been to the shopping center several times but this visit we decided to see what shops were there on the side. We love Mediterranean food so when we saw Cedars we knew we had to try it. That was one of the best choices we have made. 
The place has about 12 tables. It was pretty early for dinner so we were the only ones there. Other diners came in later. The lady who was waiting on us was very nice. She asked if we had been there before and told us the specials. After looking at the menu I had it narrowed it down to two entrees that I had never had before. I asked our server which was better. She explained them both and then explained why she liked one better than the other. I went with her pick. 
We ordered a large tabouleh as an appetizer. It was fresh, bright, and delicious.  Our entrees came and we dove right in. My husband got the steak kabobs over rice. The steak was cooked perfectly. It was very flavorful and juicy. I had the Kafta over Lebanese rice with a side of tzatiki sauce. I loved the flavor of the Kafta's mixed ground lamb and ground beef with spices. It's a little bit of a different texture than ground beef but it was really good. The rice has ground beef, seasonings, and pine nuts. It was also very delicious. While they were both very tasty, it was the tzaziki sauce that I fell in love with. It was very different than any other that I have had. It was thinner so I thought it may be bland but it packed a flavor punch. 
To finish the meal we shared a small bowl of rice pudding. It was creamy and topped with cinnamon. My husband is not a fan of rice pudding but he loved it. 
If you like Mediterranean food and are in the area you need to eat here."}
{"text":"This is the best middle eastern restaurant in western Pennsylvania hands down. If you think Aladdin's is good you have no idea what you are eating. That's like comparing Pizza Hut to a pizzeria in Rome. Cedars is literary walking into a lebanese family home to have an amazing home made meal. Authentic and delicious. I cannot recommend any dish, they are all good. My favorite is the baked Kibbeh."}
{"text":"We'd been wanting to visit for a while, especially after reading all the reviews and oh my goodness, they deserve every glowing report.  Yea, the pitas are super thin and yummy, the hummus is wonderful and the staff ( husband and wife) are very friendly.  It's a small little place so we do spend a bit more time reminding the kids to keep the noises down, but they are always very nice to us.
The first couple of times we ordered the mezza meal, which gives you a good sampling of their flavors--hummus, baba, tabbouleh (really good on the mujadarra) yogurt and cucumbers, etc.  my pregnant self loved all the pickle garnish, but be prepared for them.
The kiddos LOVED the gyro meat, and beg for it all the time.  The baklava was delish and the rice pudding caused a couple extra visits because preggo cravings.  It's not your commercialized Lebanese food, but tastes more like you'd expect from real home kitchens.  
PS byob if you are so inclined."}
{"text":"I lived most of my adolescence in the Detroit Metro area -- a place with one of the highest concentrations of Lebanese immigrants in the United States.  As a result, some of my fondest memories of Detroit are of finding a little hole-in-the-wall that served excellent homemade Lebanese food.  When I moved to Pittsburgh, I became well (and sadly) aware that such restaurants simply didn't exist in the area ... or at least, so I thought.

Cedars is a tiny, unassuming place tucked in the back of a strip mall.  When you walk in, you doubt that it's even a restaurant.  And then you order and begin eating the food, and it's pretty good stuff!  The hummus tastes freshly-made, with just the right drizzling of olive oil.  The pitas are the real Lebanese deal: paper-thin, chewy, delicious.  The rice pilaf is mouth-watering: the fragrance of pine nuts and almonds, a tantalizing hint of olive oil, savory spices.  And as for the meats?  They're the star of the show.  A proper Lebanese kebab is a study in subtle flavors; none of the loud, bold tastes that star in Greek cuisine.  Here, delicious understatement is the order of the day.  A judicious amount of charring; delicate applications of salt; subtle applications of spice -- all there, and all delicious.  The meat is perfectly cooked, no matter which meat you choose.

The prices are incredibly reasonable, and the service is incredibly friendly (how a Lebanese restaurant ends up with a Korean waitress is beyond me, but the restaurant and the waitress both are AWESOME, so ...).  Watching the flow of traffic in and out the door, it's clear that this is a community-centric place; everyone who comes in seems to be a regular.  And given the tastiness of the food and the friendliness of the staff, I can see why.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to the Cedars for dinner and it was as excellent as prior reviews indicate. We tried nearly everything - falafel, baba, kibbe, kafta, gyro, baklava, and salads - and loved it all. The baba may be the best we've ever had!

We'll be back soon, and for sure for the M-F lunch buffet ASAP!

BTW, the owner and waitress were friendly and wonderful!

And one suggestion: offer whole wheat pita and you'll get 5.5 stars!"}
{"text":"The ice tea is very good. Very different from American ice tea. I always have a very pleasant dining experience when I come here. The husband and wife owners are very welcoming and make amazing food. I love the sampler plater! It has all of my favorite appetizers. And the rice pudding is a perfect finish to your meal!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at mediterranean style restaurants all over the city of Pittsburgh. I think that Cedars takes the cake over most of the other restaurants. It especially excels over the other restaurants in this price range. There is an 'Aladdin Eatery' opening soon across RT19 from Cedars. I believe Cedars serves better and fresher food.
This small restaurant has only been open since November and they are doing a terrific job!  The daily buffet is the best deal around. It is less than $7. That is crazy-good compared to anything available in the immediate area.  The food is fresh and they keep the buffet full. That is quite an accomplishment for a staff of two. They serve fresh, ethnic food for 1/2 the price of any restaurant in the area!  I can only imagine the work that goes into keeping this going. 
We had the grape leaves, lamb, delicious rice, and salad. Even thought the buffet is not huge, everything was great and there was a good selection for my wife who is a vegetarian.
Kudos to them and all their hard work!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - something new, not a chain... I did not eat in the restaurant but got take out,  the \"Cedars Platter for 2\".  The tabbuli was good and the baba ghanouge was fantastic.  The rest of it was just ok. My husband liked the kafta kabob, I had the chicken kabob.  The chicken was well seasoned but dry.  I am going to try Cedars one more time, maybe dining in makes a difference.  I want to like this place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Best baba ganoush!!!  Great gryo sandwichs!

Service is fast and friendly.  Many choices on the menus - all delicious!

I wish this place was more visible on the busy road (Rt 19) - it would probably be always packed.  The food here is alwasy good.  Try the iced tea - mint with cinnamon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, home-made tasting food. It's always a surprise to stumble across a nice place to eat in the hidden back corner of a strip mall, and these places are often overlooked. But don't skip Cedars for the easier to find, more expensive and not as good Aladdin's across the street. 
Best. Baba Ever."}
