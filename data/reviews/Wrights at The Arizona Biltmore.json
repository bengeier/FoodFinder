{"text":"So that's a Waldorf Salad.  I like it and I am going to guess that Arizona Biltmore, a Waldorf Astoria  hotel, had the recipe right.    New menu came out last week.  Lots of Gordon Ramsey difficult entrees - like beef wellington and lobster thermador.    Friendly, happy guests and staff.  The Wrights lobby bar is also where the Tequila Sunrise was invented.  Lots of architectural features within plain sight.  Good flow to the whole place."}
{"text":"Wow!  What an experience.  Started with some jumbo shrimp and crab claws. Then the real treat started. The scallop with parsnip purée cooked perfectly and presented with elegance. It was served with salty pork cubes. Moved on to the egg Benedict. Served on a crunchy tortilla with chicken. Great!  Deserts were unbelievable. The Carmel pana cotta was the best I have ever had. Service was fantastic. $39.99 felt like a bargain. Kids buffet was 1/2 that."}
{"text":"My partner was able to score Valentine's Day dinner reservations on the patio which had me pretty excited to be checking out one of the more exclusive valley restaurants. There was a fixed prix fixe menu offered that evening featuring 4 courses plus 2 chefs tastings, not all of which rendered such a renowned valley establishment with a 5 star reputation worthy of such accolades. But that being said the grounds are quite beautiful - romantic, quaint, offers seating not clustered, and impeccably maintained all while taking in frank loyd wright's protege's keen eye for architectural design.   But back to the food.  1st chef tasting - pacific oysters garnished with a creme fresche, diced greens and tomato. The combination yielded a nice light crisp finish, garnishing a no brainier as the oyster varietal naturally has cucumber overtones. 1st course - lobster bisque - It's some of the best lobster bisque I've had on the west coast. Creamy decadent full of that lobster flavor extracted to the broth augmented by a good amount actual lobster meat from the body.  2nd course - foie tourchon - think foie gras laid on a bed of fig macadamia pomegranate seeds with a touch of balsamic. The liver content of foie gras seemed watered down. Maybe dumbed down a little for the prix fixe menu. That being said the quality of the ingredients completed each other quite well in this dish.  3rd course - filet with crab - It was served to the table luke warm. It was cooler than buffet food sitting for hours waiting for someone to consume it. Seemed like a nice char on the outside cooked to order in the center. Asparagus was tasty as were mashed potatoes. Bernaise was unexceptional.  2nd chef tasting - apple cotton candy. Haven't had cotton candy in years! It was light sweet hint of apple and cleared the palate nicely.  4th course - chocolate soufflé - Wrights makes some of the best soufflés in town. It was right on! A review based solely on the entree probably deserves 2.5 stars likely due to lapse in service but overall given price considerations and expectations for a restaurant of this caliber 3.99 stars."}
{"text":"I only experienced Wright's for dessert, but I wasn't overly impressed. The dining room is simple, really just an extension of the Biltmore lobby in architecture and decor. The service is friendly, but slow. The server showed up quickly to take our drink orders, but then it took 10 minutes before we got our waters and another 10 minutes for our server to come back to take our food order. On his recommendation, we tried the baked Alaska. It was okay - nothing special. There was way to much of the marshmallow flavored meringue, which was sickeningly sweet, and very little of the sponge cake. I might give Wright's a try for dinner or brunch someday, but I'm in no hurry after this mediocre dessert."}
{"text":"My BFF (best friend forever), the architect from LA, was visiting for the weekend and is a huge fan of FLW (frank lloyd wright) so we decided to get girly enjoy the flw decor and architecture and have a ladies brunch at Wright's. Although the menu is a little pricey it's definitely worth it because you order from the alacarte menu and you get the salad/seafood/appetizer/dessert buffet for free.    I think I got the steak and eggs and it was $32 and she got the salmon for $30. The seafood at the buffet included crab claws, mussels, clams, lox. There was also a caprese salad (mozzarella and tomato), prosciutto, salami, and other cold meats.   Everything was very satisfying but tried to hold back on getting \"thirds\" because it just didn't seem like the place where you pigged out."}
{"text":"Great Place to Throw an Easy Elegant Sunday Brunch Party!  My siblings and I threw my Mom's 90th birthday brunch here in September. It was a group of 70, so we had the restaurant to ourselves, as we scheduled it for after the normal Sunday brunch hours.   What a gorgeous setting to have a party. The varied seating options and stunning historic architecture was quite party friendly. Everyone was up and down getting their food and, unlike normal full table service banquet style parties, this totally encouraged our guests to mix it up and hop from table to table visiting with one another. So festive!!  And the beautifully presented and delicious food was outstanding. This IS Wright's at the Biltmore, after all, and we were banking on food quality on parr with a venerable luxury resort. They offer about 5 hot \"entrees\" that guests have to order at their table, but you can order as many as you like for the prix set brunch price. So much more elegant for the guests to be able to choose from both the lovely brunch buffet spread AND the hot appetizer size entrees served to you at the table. Also, by the way, the brunch price is REALLY reasonable, which is nice to know if you are a couple on an AZ vacation get-a-way and even better to know if you are paying for a party of 70!!  All of our party logistics were smoothly managed by Dolan, who did a great job attending to our needs and overseeing the level of service provided to our entire group. In fact, I have high praise for the entire wait staff - they were professional, attentive and super friendly to our multi-generational mix of party guests.  Thanks Wright's at the Biltmore! You helped us make a memorable event for my Mom and our family and friends. If you grew up in the Phoenix Valley, like we did, you may not automatically think of the Biltmore as a place to go because it isn't a new, \"hot\" place on the Valley dining scene. But think again."}
{"text":"I've loved Wright's since the 90's. My late partner and I dined there at least twice a month for over 15 years.  Finally revisited with a new date, Friday night. Very impressed with the tastefully done, contemporary renovations. Loved our hostess, servers, food, presentation.  We created our own version of Tapas, by ordering several appetizers and side dishes to share. Octopus Scallops Roasted mushrooms Brussel sprouts Etc. Along with a lovely bottle of Reisling.  Perfection."}
{"text":"Oyster, shrimp, crab... And thats just to start! Excellent Sunday brunch and fabulous dinners in a quiet relaxing atmosphere with top notch service. Definitely a five star!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting and atmosphere. Have dined here multiple times over 20 years, and twice on this visit. Waitstaff are fine, if not as sharp as in past years. In particular the food has really  taken a bad turn in the last 5 years. Very narrow choices (all meat, little seafood, no vegetarian), over-produced and fussy combinations and presentations--it's no longer about good food, but obscure products put together in \"inventive\" ways that aren't always pleasant or necessary. Not enough of any one of the half-dozen items on a plate to get any sense of it by itself---muddys the flavors. No salads (kale is not a salad by itself) and other appetizers are way too complicated. The house \"fry bread\" was soaking in oil both nights, and the blue cork cakes and the cornbread included on two different entres was really bad--soggy with oil on one, over-ingrediented on the other. Where is the pure taste of the food itself? Wine list (no sommelier now) has declined and prices are way out of line with reasonable restaurant markup. Even the souffles have been halved in size so romantic sharing is now an exercise in spoon combat.  It's an expensive meal for what you actually get, and about all you get... is that lovely interior. Time for a change in course. Stacked food and over complicated preparations with too many ingredients is a fad that went out a decade ago. Time for Maybury to revisit the cuisine and imagine better food, real food  We'll be back to stay, we always do, but I'm not sure we'll be back to dine. Sad, because this was such a treat over the years."}
{"text":"Went here for a 5-course wine pairing dinner at the beginning of May. Everything was perfect, from the wines that were matched expertly to each course, to the presentation of each dish. Will never hesitate to go here the next time it is suggested. Unless you have a particular aversion to a specific dish, you will be pleased with whatever you order. One of the best meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"Wow! My husband and I just left the Wright Restaurant. The service was amazing and the food incredible this was our first time here and after tonight's amazing service we would definitely be back.  We celebrated My 30th birthday and the chef made the dessert extra special.  We were blessed to find this place and will definitely be back. Our server was outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite brunch place. The food is spectacular and the service is simply the best. Our new go to place on Sundays."}
{"text":"Six months later, I am still disgusted.  I won't eat scallops.  Thank you Biltmore for ruining a crustacean species for me."}
{"text":"Best Brunch. The food was phenomenal, service was so-so. I'm giving a five-star because the food was exceptional. The quail was perfectly cooked: rare yet tender, along with buttery small potatoes. The scallop was also perfect and perfectly cooked. Pre-made dishes like the seared tuna were also very good. Raw scallops on the shell were so good, a tad too cold for my taste but left on the table for a few minutes to thaw and with some sea salt sprinkled on them, they are spectacular. If we find ourselves in Phoenix again, this will be our first stop."}
{"text":"Thank you to Wright's at the Biltmore staff for making our wedding brunch reception on December 20th such a BEAUTIFUL event. The private dining room was beautiful. A SPECIAL THANKS to Wright's General Manager Dolan Olson and Chef Ron Hunter (the Neapolitan ice cream waffles were PERFECT!) The venue was awesome, the food was incredible, and all of the personalized attention that we received made it MOST SPECIAL! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch is extraordinary. Last Sunday, we had the buffet for $25 with a fabulous selection of choices from fresh sushi, pastries, desserts, fruits and on and on...even a press pot of coffee. We could have had many additional hot choices for $10 (a bargain) more, but didn't see the need. Loved it. Terrific service. Quiet. One of the best gourmet bargains we've found. the Frank Lloyd Wright designs shine through."}
{"text":"Great dinner experience. Waiter was very friendly and they gave us a free sample appetizer. We didn't ask for it.  It just came. We also got an extra dessert for free just because the restaurant was a bit quiet and they were being nice.  I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I went there last year with the same friends and we all agreed that it was not as good this year. The service was great but the selection needs to varied more for the expensive cost of the brunch - $52.00 plus a person for brunch with mimosas or Bloody Mary - the cold selection of seafood - oysters, huge shrimp and crab claws was great but it fell off from there - the cold meat selection was nice but limited and neither it nor the cheeses were labeled which would have been nice - some of the desserts were labeled but many were not. The five hot entrees were nice and size allowed to try them all. Today the selection allowed for an egg Benedict which was outstanding as was the boar. The waffles and pancakes are nice but I would try them last because they fill you up fast. I wish the coffee was hotter and they never offered us fresh orange juice."}
{"text":"Beautiful resort. Beautiful restaurant. Beautiful company.  And, of course, beautiful food.  My experience at Wright's was nothing short of perfection. Starting off with the service: attentive and professional, exactly what I would expect.  I ordered the Chef's tasting menu with wine pairings; a 3-course menu that somehow turned into 5.  The amuse was poached shrimp with a smoked corn and tomato relish, it was perfectly balanced and the smokiness of the corn complemented the sweetness of the shrimp.  Next was the asparagus soup.  I love asparagus anyway, but I LOVED this soup.  Thick and creamy, with pieces of asparagus and bacon, and a nicely poached egg sitting right on top.  The egg yolk added so much richness and depth to the dish.  Following the soup was probably my favorite dish of the night: a seared duck breast on a bed of prosciutto, tangelos, and a salad of petite greens tossed in a tangelo vinaigrette.  This dish was amazing; beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.  My entree was a heaping bowl of lobster rigatoni with green onions and English peas. Everything in the dish worked; the pasta was al dente, the lobster was rich and tender, and the sauce was delicious.  Dessert was the only disappointment of the meal, albeit a small one.  A macaroon tasting plate.  It was good, just not what I would expect from a restaurant like Wright's.  I left Wright's feeling fat, happy, and a little tipsy; everything I hope to get out of a meal when I go out."}
{"text":"I just love the Sunday brunch at Wrights! The $8 bottomless sparkling wine/mimosa keeps me coming back. The entree's prepared in the kitchen offer freshly prepared dishes to go with the buffet selections. Try it, you will like it too!"}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday which happened to be on a Sunday so we came for brunch. We enjoyed it thoroughly. I made our reservation on open table through their website and mentioned that we were celebrating his birthday. We were greeted with lovely piano music just outside the dining area where we met the host. She sat us in a private dining area which had been reserved for our occasion. We felt like the queen and king of the establishment because of the furniture in the room, and we were beyond excited. The champagne brunch has free flowing mimosas for a bit extra and a quaint menu of small dishes to choose from along with the cold offerings. You can order as many of the small dishes as you please (I thought before we went that you could only choose one.) We tried all of the dishes and were completely satisfied by the time the last small plate, the steak, came out. Our service was incredible and each member of the staff that came to our table wished my boyfriend a happy birthday. Thanks for making his birthday unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Great location and ambience for a special event, occasion. Frank and Albert's next to Wright's is more casual but equally pleasant with outdoor dining!  Always a treat either place."}
{"text":"Very nice Brunch service. We were treated very well and actually were given a private little table area as requested but was unexpected. Everything was fabulous and the food was very good. Tiny plates for the hot dishes but you can order more than one if you want more. Go hungry and ENJOY! This was a first time, not out last, and we walked around the grounds a bit and checked out the spa and got a tour by Jen who was AWESOME and very friendly! Just a fun day!"}
{"text":"Good service, good wine selection. Some of the food has some great unique flavors. Some of the dishes we enjoyed were the Scallop appetizer, Lobster Bisque soup, Sea Bass entree, and a seafood special they offered. A few things we were not fond of were the smoked beef tartare, the souffle is not impressive at all, and the cheesecake was not good and didn't have crust...the best part! Overall the portions are small and I would recommend ordering a side to go with your entree.   We also went for Sunday Brunch and it was unique in that they have a few things that are made fresh to order that are unlimited as well as a few stations including seafood and desserts. Although what they had to offer was good, I just felt like it was lacking the basic brunch items. Mimosas were $10 unlimited."}
{"text":"We had a great meal. We got seated near a large loud table and were moved to a quieter table without a fuss. The menu offers a varied choice. All sounded delicious. We enjoyed our choices. We splurged and went from soup to nuts, including eating the cotton candy that came with the bill. Wright's lived up to it's billing."}
{"text":"Breakfast is usually my favorite meal to eat out... the only thing that I look forward to even more is the very occasional fancy-pants brunch.  I had the good fortune to be treated to an amazing meal at Wright's... and now I just need to figure out another special occasion that warrants a special outing back to the Biltmore.  Our service was fantastic, as expected at the Biltmore.  Water glasses were always full, napkins nicely arranged while we were up, and plates removed quickly.    The menu is kind of interesting... you can \"order\" the buffet or one of their entrees (which includes the buffet.  The buffet alone is $30... but the entrees are barely more than that.  For $5-10 more, you will have one of the most amazing meals ever... PLUS the amazing array of goodies from the buffet.  Do yourself a big favor and order the Eggs Benedict.  I'm not a poached egg fan, so I always order them scrambled... and this was seriously the most perfectly created breakfast dish I've ever had... anywhere.   We also enjoyed the salmon, but were less thrilled with the lobster and scallop roll.  Honestly, I could barely eat my entree because of my over-indulgence of buffet items... so the staff kindly boxed it for me to-go.  Talk about the best take-out meal ever!  The buffet had a great assortment of cheese and antipasta, assorted salads, pastries, huge shrimp and crab legs, a tasty ceviche, a couple types of sushi and more.  The star of the show was the dessert table.  I literally tried EVERY dessert they had out (don't worry... I was sharing!)... my favorites were the coconut cream tart, molten chocolate cake, peanut butter chocolate cup, cheesecake and toffee-chocolate chip cookies.  Mmmmm... I think I may have just gotten diabetes, just from this meal alone.  This is definitely a splurge place for me... and I can't wait for an occasion to return."}
{"text":"Delightful dining experience.  Thoughtful staff and wonderful food.  The presentation was artful and prepared to perfection. The building is a historic structure.  Wonderful!  It is attached to the hotel through the main lobby past a friendly bar."}
{"text":"We headed to dinner after booking a short stay at the Arizona Biltmore.  We went in with minimal expectations given we live in the bay area, however the service and food were of bay area standards.  The atmosphere is modern yet in line with the architecture of the hotel.  We started with the cold seafood platter which was fresh and delicious.  The menu is set up so that you can either order in small plate or in a traditional appetizer/entree manner.  We decided to get a couple of items as small plates which we did the steak tartare with quail egg and the Caesar salad.  Both were great.  We then split the beef wellington which was a lot of food for one person, let alone 2.  The meat was cooked perfectly and like butter.  The puff pastry was minimal but added a lot of richness.  We were quite full and were unable to tackle dessert, but the menu looked great.  I highly recommend if you are in the Phoenix area to try this place out."}
{"text":"Rarely do you find such value at a $$$$ restaurant. Portions are larger than you'd expect even in the small plates for expensive ingredients like filet Mignon, lobster and foie gras.   Food: Typical of high scale restaurants you get some freebies. Among the breads the garlic is the best, my co-worker went through five slices! Another freebie are prawns which are imparted with a smoky flavor from the grill, excellent. We got foie gras for our appetizer. It was served with fresh herbs on a graham cracker like crust. Juicy and succulent I can see myself getting foie gras much more often after this one.  The beef wellington i had was cooked perfectly. The dough and duck fat that surrounded it could not have been better. After being so pleased with the app and entree i was underwhelmed by the desert. The dark chocolate soufflé  came with a sauce that tasted like it had only a hint of dark chocolate. Not worth it for chocolate lovers.  Price: Although expensive these ingredients are usually twice the price at different restaurants.  Ambiance: The whole hotel has the Frank Lloyd Wright feel which looks amazing although there is nothing special about this place when compared to the rest of the hotel.  Bottom Line: If you're staying at the Biltmore Hotel this place is your best bet for satisfaction."}
{"text":"amazing sunday brunch...   really enjoyed the lobster, jumbo shrimp and other items from the buffet but what stood out were the small plates.  for an additional $10 you can sample any of the 7 small plates cooked to order. i tried 5 items from waffles to chicken and they were 5 star worthy as were the desserts.   i stayed at the hotel the last few days and it was a perfect way to end our stay.  i spent a little more the i normally would for a brunch but this was certainly a great choice and very happy i read the other recommedations."}
{"text":"My partner and I had brunch at Wright's on Sunday and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The restaurant wisely separates cold from hot offerings, with cold seafood, meats, cheeses, and breads/desserts on the buffet.  Five hot offerings are prepared on request.  I tried the rosemary waffles which were so good I immediately ordered another.  We also tried the blueberry pancakes which were fluffy and extremely tasty.  The highlight for me was the cold seafood--crab claws, enormous shrimp, smoked salmon.  I'm originally from the coast, and the quality of the seafood was top-notch.  (Oysters on the half-shell were also available, but I don't eat them.)  My partner enjoyed the charcuterie and cheese offerings.  For those who imbibe, Wright's offers a bottomless mimosa for an additional $10.  Our service was incredible and the food was delicious.  Also, I saw a chef walking around with a chocolate birthday creation that made me wish it had been my birthday!  Highly recommended, but come hungry."}
{"text":"Ate here for a meeting. They had a pre fixe three course menu, each course of which included meat & dairy components. I'm a vegan, so requested that \"just a salad will be fine.\" I didn't expect much, because I am used to not receiving much in the way of vegan food, even from pretty nice restaurants.  Wright's served a full 3 course vegan meal that was absolutely delicious. I haven't had such a good set of vegan food in a long time, possibly ever. I only wish that I had more time to dedicate my full attention to the meal.  Good starter salad (fairly basic) - good rolls - excellent succotash, really to die for - and an excellent dessert. Pretty sure they have a good wine list, the red that was served at the table was very good. Plus they served key lime flavored cotton candy as a freebie at the end, awesome.  Service was also great, despite that I was a bit gruff explaining that I am vegan. I would give more than 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Fab-u-lous!   The architecture is amazing and the hotel and grounds are decorated perfectly for the holidays. The food is elegant, sophisticated, and perfectly done. The brunch buffet is beautiful and flavorful with a nice variety of cold items.  The brunch is pricey starting at at least $28 depending on which entree you select. The buffet is included in the price of your selected entree. The buffet on it's own is $30. Expensive, but well worth the price.   It was a lovely treat for the holidays!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Sunday brunch.  Went with my mother and our wedding planner.  It was great.  Will be back for sure, especially since we were married at this hotel in Cottage Court and reception in the Aztec room.  Wonderful lobby as well.  Recommend it for a nice long brunch."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue. Delightful meal. Fantastic service. At the host stand, we were seated swiftly and politely at a lovely table for two in the secluded back corner. Every staff member we interacted with was pleasant and courteous. The food itself was very well-prepared--I had a foie gras appetizer and duck entree. Very flavorful foie gras with perfect accompaniments. The duck was tender and perfectly-cooked. These dishes are so far my favorite of their kind in Phoenix. This is a truly marvelous restaurant, and I appreciate the decor, food, and service all around."}
{"text":"Only two stars because the staff was so nice, but one star for the food.  The experience and food were nowhere near a high end and high price experience.  I think the restaurant is incredibly dated and only gets by because of history.   The \"heirloom\" tomatoes were mealy, mushy, and tasteless.  The brussel sprouts were so incredibly salty and acidic that they were inedible.  The blue corn cake was fine but nothing near what one would expect from a high end restaurant/hotel.  And they made a mistake on our order and two of the appetizers never came out.   Beef edible, but not amazing considering the price.   Please do not waste your money."}
{"text":"We had Brunch at the Biltmore's \"Wrights\" last weekend. A very interesting concept that offers both buffet and plated brunch fare. The buffet is all cold with wonderful selections like shrimp, king crab, sushi, and salmon caviar. The desserts were good and selection plentiful. Buffet is $30.   For an additional $4 to $9 you can have a plated hot meal. Hard to pass this up, we got the pork sandwich topped with poached egg. Jeff,  the steak and eggs. Both were amazing! Had we not been on vacation, there would be plenty to take home!    Beautiful setting and first class service. Wasn't sure why it wasn't packed, perhaps the season is not yet in full swing.    I feel bad for the McArthur, architect of record, loads of F.L. Wright accolades for a man who only consulted on the building."}
{"text":"We came here last Sunday on Father's day for the brunch. Price is definitely worth it for the food, service and atmosphere. $25 for the buffet style for the cold items and $10 extra for the unlimited made to order small plates of 7 different hot items, drinks not included. The buffet had shrimp cocktail, 4 diff sushi rolls, assorted pastries, cheese, smoked salmon, smoked duck, caviar, varieties of desserts. I am not usually big fan of shrimp cocktail at buffet place, but theirs were really good and cooked perfect. A bit disappointed that they put all the large shrimps on top but the bottom ones hidden under the large ones were the small ones. The smoked salmon and smoked duck were awesome. Desserts were very pretty and decent but mostly too sweet to my taste. Sushi rolls were pretty good. We tried all the 7 hot plates to be shared among the 3 of us, the lamb was soooo delish that I had two orders of it and I don't usually even like the smell of lamb, but this didnt have the heavy smell. The waffle and pancakes were really good, except that I didn't quite enjoy the combination of the bacon bits on the waffle. I also loved the lobster mini sandwich. Polenta was yuck and the most raved egg benedict was not special. I didn't get to try the beef and mac n cheese, but hubby said the macncheese was good but beef was just average. We called ahead to let them know that it was also our anniversary and they would take note of it, but it didn't appear that any note was made. I know it's only brunch and not full dinner but would still appreciate a bit recognition on it, so I ended up asking the host if they could do something. So came an empty plate with chocolate writing saying Happy Anniversary on it and was told to get some dessert from the buffet to put on the plate. May be that's how they do it, I don't have complaint but was not exactly expecting an empty plate :) Overall, I would have no problem returning there for a casual upscale brunch."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointing. My wife and I are attending a conference at the Arizona Biltmore. Rather than joining the group for their offsite party, we opted for a quiet dinner for two at the Biltmore's flagship restaurant. It was a disaster.  We decided to try the Taste of April - a three course meal $48 apiece with optional wine pairings for an additional $25 apiece. The asparagus soup was outstanding. The lobster pasta was awful - pasta at the bottom of the plate was a perfect al dente but most was very under cooked. Dessert came after about 20 minutes of waiting - a plate of 5 small pastries with assorted fillings. The pastries were tough and dry, and the fillings were not good.  The wine pairings were OK - but served with no insight or explanation on the vintages being poured. The first wine was poured well ahead of the soup being delivered and a refill was not offered. The second wine was poured after we were chewing our undercooked pasta. And the third came out 10 minutes before its dessert pairing. Suffice it to say we had sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, and merlot. That's all I know.  Something had to be wrong, but that is not our problem. The waiter was friendly enough, but the service was awful and the food was below subpar. To their credit, the manager comped our meal and bought us a glass of wine at the bar. His actions earned the second star."}
{"text":"It was an atypical Sunday morning.   We were dreading the normal brunch venues that we are presented with.   The pangs of hunger had gripped us, and we wanted something different.  My wife did some research, and she suggested that we try Wright's Sunday Brunch Buffet, which included fresh seafood.  Now, that's a novel idea!  Serve fresh seafood as part of a Sunday Brunch Menu.   That is something that I could get behind, especially when we were particularly famished.   I called to make reservations, and was notified that they had limited seating because of the myriad of guests at the Biltmore Hotel for the College National Championships.  At that moment, I felt enough of a deterrent that I wanted to cancel, but when I purpose to get something done; I often forge ahead irrespective of consequences. Although, I didn't really want to fight for seating with the ESPN team who were all over the place.  In any case, we arrived, and were promptly greeted by the plethora of valet attendants who so graciously welcomed us.   This was a good sign as the valets at the Phoenician (yes, that other establishment) are not as attentive nor are they as courteous. It was a wonderful change.  We meandered on over to Wright's, and walked past the private dining area that I once rented for my wife's birthday so that she could celebrate it with her closest of friends.   Ah, what a memory! But, I digress.  The hostess greeted us, and promptly seated us and introduced James as our server.  James is an affable server; extremely polite, courteous and efficient. He truly made our experience a wonderfully memorable one.  We opened up our pallets by visiting the seafood, fruit and pastry buffet. I must say that the the whole presentation, and the seafood platters were just simply magnificent! It truly was fresh, and impeccably prepared.  James, then proceeded to introduce the small plate entree selections that we could sample, and my wife and I chose a wide variety of their offerings.   From the quiche lorraine, to the eggs benedict, waffle, pancake, and salmon. Everything was just done to perfection, and the sampling portions were just right.  What we received was just a heavenly brunch, and superb service, amidst the chaos of the myriad of visitors gracing the Biltmore's grounds.  All in All, I have yet to be disappointed whenever I visit Wright's @ the Biltmore. Whether it has been for my wife's birthday party, a business meeting, or even just a casual Sunday brunch.   Each and every experience has delivered in spades!"}
{"text":"First, Yelp is showing Wrights as serving Breakfast and Brunch, but it serves Dinner and Sunday Brunch...and no dinner service on Sunday evening.  Service was stellar, and not pretentious, which is a big \"plus\" in my book. I was dining alone, and made to feel like an honored guest.  Servers joked with me, chatted, and were fabulous!  Cannot say enough good things about them.  That said, the food was not great.  I ordered the foie gras as a starter, and although the texture was perfect, it was incredibly salty, a bit too cold, and did not pair well with the chunks of gingerbread served with it - probably because of the excessive saltiness. Having enjoyed excellent foie gras in many restaurants in Paris and Bourgogne, this was not up to snuff.   My entree was the smoked duck breast, served in two long spears (a bit odd) with duck confit in a merlot reduction and black-eyed peas.  Couldn't taste the smokiness of the duck breast, just gaminess, and it was not especially tender.  The confit was delicious, but just presented as a shredded pile under the two long slices of breast...and there was something unidentifiable on the plate that appeared to be some sort of \"innard,\" but the restaurant was dark and I couldn't figure it out.  Again, I've had incredibly delicious duck breast both at my own home and in other restaurants, and this dish did not measure up.  It wasn't terrible, but I would not order it again.  While staying at The Biltmore you are somewhat captive without a car, and Wright's is the only fine dining choice at the resort.  I was hoping for a stellar meal on my own, but was somewhat disappointed.  All-in-all, for the $101 tab (including tip), I would give Wright's a miss and take an Uber to somewhere offsite."}
{"text":"Tasty but very formal. Classy ambience. Great for business meals or when you need a nice intimate setting. Also good for groups of 10-15 dinner parties as they have a nice outdoor area where you can have cocktails before dinner."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner was outstanding, food, wine and service. Highly recommend for special event dinners, expensive. Beautiful setting."}
{"text":"Amazing hotel, beautiful setting, best brunch we've ever had"}
{"text":"If your ready to try a new dish , this is the place .. There some amazing foods on the menu that are absolutely delish and you can't find them at every restaurant .. Presentation of food and quaintly outstanding !! Service from the staff impeccable , I would recommend anyone to try Wrights at the Biltmore for a small romantic dinner to a nice family dinner !!"}
{"text":"Loved their food  Has a little bit of an old people vibe though.... a bit dated....  Honestly, the food was top notch.    I did see a giant cockroach run across the dining room floor though....   Hmm.....  I'm torn on how many stars to give this one.....  Hmm.....  I'll give 3 for exceptional food. -2 for the huge cockroach."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Bottomless mimosas and a great buffet and entree plate selection. Beautiful hotel and great atmosphere. Will be back"}
{"text":"Unforgettable experience.  Beautiful setting. , good food &  music.  Excellent service. & to top it all, you get to walk  it off by touring the magnificent  hotel lobbies & grounds. Worth it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here last night, amazing service and good food.  We got to sit in on of the beautiful front booths and had a great waiter who was very attentive.  The menu is small but good.  We started off with the Lobster Bisque (amazing) and beet salad (pretty good).  Then had the veggie risotto (good, ordered the side which was enough) and beef wellington (great).  Finished with a soufflé (pretty good). OverAll it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group and really enjoyed a meal far more than I should.  Service was prompt though the drink orders kept getting messed up and the water refills a little slow.    I had the roasted onion soup which was terrific. Days later I still think about those croutons and the deep, rich broth that accompanied it. It was a little too salty but overall so much better than those other french onion soups that masquerade as the real thing.  The duck was also a big hit.  It was quite tender.  Add a little sausage and you had a nice balanced main dish.  The \"bananas foster\" was nothing like bananas foster, but a new take on it. I'm not even a bananas fan and I enjoyed it much.  Overall, is it worth it for the price? Who knows. Someone else picked up my tab. But it is a good place to take a group when staying at the resort."}
{"text":"Staff was lovely at the beginning of our meal, but Service became extraordinarily slow throughout our visit.  Our food took 1 to 1 1/2 hours to come out and it was less than expected by far.  We couldn't get out of there soon enough."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch is off the hook, it's a Foodies Emporium.  Why?  The Chef De Cuisine, Brian Peterson. The guy just won't sit still. That's why.  Every week these folks create 5 small Plate items, each one so unique, a truly diverse set of flavors. They are all you can eat, and when ordered come from his kitchen direct to your table.  His carving station has featured Filet Mignon, Prime Rib Cap, Iberico Pork, Wild Boar, NY Strip, Veal Rib Roast, the list goes on.  Think you have this figured out? Wrong. Each week, everything is turned upside down. Start over. What's fresh, What's local, What's Stylin? Bang. That's what you're having. Every Sunday is unique and equally stellar.  Add an eatable changing food display that has featured, foie gras, king crab, beef carpaccio, crab claws, lobster, smoked duck breast, pork belly, caviar, etc.  It gets better.  Throw in a service team, which will make your head spin. You will believe you have arrived at your \"life style of the rich and famous\" alternate reality, if just for a few hours.  When you see the price tag, you won't believe a word I say, especially when compared to some very pricey brunch options in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Call ahead Saturday for the menu and ask what's on the carving station, if you are a foodie, or not this is addictive. I'm practically sitting in the parking lot on Saturday."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed Wrights. The service was great from the hostess, to the waiter, to the busser. Everyone has an equally important role and did their best.  The chef out did himself. The deconstructed beef Wellington was amazing, as was the compte potatoes. We also has the Oreo soufflé, and lastly they sent out cotton candy. It was all delicious and we truly enjoyed it.   Also, they gave us a private seating are which was pretty cool."}
{"text":"I love the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. We used to stay here all the time in the late 1990's and 2000's. I remember the place before the Villas were built. I adore the Catalina Pool with the Spanish tiles and the Biltmore Brick.  We would take my parents and Jack's parents here for the lovely brunch.  So on our visit to friends this past weekend, I thought we come back. It was their son's birthday so we also brought him and his wife. We had a nice round table for six.  The brunch is still a starter and dessert buffet with a main you order from the menu. You get a choice of one of five. To start, the appetizers were a little on the skimpy side as compared to the fancy brunches at place like the Phoenician or even the specialty restaurants on some cruise ships. For my entree I ordered the eggs benedict with black forest ham, spinach and a hollandaise. I was expecting a normal size plate since it is the only main course. What I got was a bonzai deconstructed benedict. There was a tiny silver dollar sized puffy pastry thing. Next to it was a round piece of black forest ham a little larger tan a quarter. Next to it was cooked spinach about the size of a thumb nail. Then came a poached egg which did have a runny yolk but a snotty white. One of our friends actually sent hers back. There was also a small amount of sauce.  Now I am not a big eater. I graze. But this entree could have been eaten in two mouthfuls. It was pretty pitiful.  Overall we did enjoy the ambiance and the company, of course. I would still stay at the hotel. But I would not return for the brunch."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW...  The architecture and design was beautiful.  The food was awesome.  The service was friendly and attentive - despite the fact that I had been traveling half the day, probably looked like hell, and should have been hidden from the general public.  Yes, it was expensive but I was on vacation and celebrating a milestone birthday.  This is definitely the place to splurge on yourself.  All the suggestions from our server were on the money, so if you don't know what to get, just ask!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch buffet. Somehow, between my internet searches and the time we arrived for brunch (time span: hours), the menu and pricing had been streamlined such that $39.99 got us the expansive cold item/dessert buffet, the hot small plates, and unlimited coffee/tea/juices, and an extra $8 got my husband unlimited mimosas.  The menu is always changing, and certainly some dishes are more memorable than others. For us, the hot pork tenderloin was perfect: crisp crust and tender inside. Our Wright's benedict kind of fell apart as it arrived to us but it was still tasty. The cold seafood bar was fantastic. The cold lamb bite with cous cous was alright only.  The desserts were all great, but by that time we had not paced ourselves and we were stuffed, so the desserts were kind of a blur.  Service was friendly and attentive. I would consider coming back to Phoenix just for this buffet -- what an amazing find/value!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to dine at the flagship restaurant of the iconic Arizona Biltmore. Very disappointed. I wanted to try a few apps so I did the sliders and the cheese plate.  I thought the sliders were just ok , some sort of chipotle ketchup and what appeared to be an average roll. The cheese plate was not bad, better than the sliders loaded with another bread , way too much and stale. I stopped there and went elsewhere. I will say this, I am there on business twice a year, I would sit at their bar and order the jumbo shrimp but those are off the menu now. Frank and Alberts is great for lunch and dinner . Same with the room service I have ordered . I would stay away from the Wrights , at least for now."}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere. The wine selection is plentiful. My wife had the fresh fish, it was flaky and moist, the way fish should be. I had the bison with vegetables, what a tender and delicious suggestion by our waiter!  This is great place to have a romantic dinner. On a Saturday night, they have live music playing in the lobby."}
{"text":"The ambiance is fantastic! Situated inside the Waldorf Astoria's Biltmore Resort, the location is perfect. There is a cold buffet that has delicious, fresh shrimp and other delicious cold seafood. Nice selection of cheese and deli meats along with a great spread of fresh bread such as buttery croissants. The freshly prepared hot items were fantastic! Our favorites were the grilled shrimp on polenta and the pancakes with warm maple syrup and a great blueberry compote. At $40/person, a very nice value."}
{"text":"The butter was in the shape of the Frank Lloyd Wright Style Textile Blocks that make up the resort.   That was my first impression.   I knew it was good from the get go.  Wonderfully friendly staff, from the host to server. Bread basket was top notch. The margaritas are fun, and somewhat historic...read the history of the Tequila Sunrise ....  Had the Venison Tomahawk. Delicious, cooked perfectly.  My snobby buddy sent back his wine -- he's a sommelier and could tell the storage method was poor and the alcohol level was \"off.\"  They obliged , brought him a sealed bottle and poured from it...while I made jokes at his expense.  Atmosphere is sex. Wish I had been with a chick, not a dick."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I flew out to Phoenix so he could meet my parents. After a really nice weekend with them, we thought it would be nice for him and I to cap it off by inviting them to a lovely Sunday brunch before we headed to the airport. It just so happened that Sunday coincided with Easter. I made my Sunday brunch reservations for the four of us over Opentable.com and the week before the reservation, I received a call from the restaurant asking me to confirm the reservation. They also asked for my credit card to hold the reservation.  The brunch itself was tasty and enjoyable. The service was great. But we were quick to learn upon our arrival that this was NOT the standard Sunday brunch. That for their holiday brunch, they automatically included a hot buffet, coffee, tea, and champagne for all guests. At first I thought this meant we would all have to pay $35-38 for the hot menu price.  Imagine our surprise when my boyfriend received the bill and it was $430 (including tax and a pre-included gratuity)! That means brunch for each of us cost over $100, which is a far cry from the advertised $35 brunch!   Shame on Wright's for not telling us about this beforehand. Why didn't they inform us that the buffet would be over 3 times the regular price for this holiday Sunday?  While we enjoyed the brunch, I can't imagine we'll be back. At $110/person, this is not a good value for your money."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been fortunate enough to make several visits over the year to the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix. We enjoy the natural beauty, the golf and the comfortable, yet upscale environment.  One of our favorite restaurants in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area happens to be located within the Biltmore resort ... \"Wright's at the Biltmore\". We dined there a few weeks ago during a golf trip - what a treat.  We started with a Tequila Sunrise. Quite frankly, I am not a tequila drinker but this time I made an exception because the Tequila Sunrise cocktail originated at the Arizona Biltmore (history factoid). Their \"Original\" Tequila Sunrise is apparently mixed a little differently than what you typically get and it was not bad at all. Remember, I am not a big fan of Tequila.    The atmosphere, food and service at Wright's were phenomenal (and have always been for us). We first enjoyed wild mushrooms and an order of asparagus. Delicious! .........We then switched to a bottle of DUCKHORN Merlot in preparation for the main course.   I ordered the wagyu ribeye with a potato puree, onion gratin and foie gras. It was absolutely perfect .... and, note - a more than generous portion.  My lady had the beef wellington with a béarnaise sauce, roasted vegetables and potato gratin. She finished her plate with a smile!!  To prolong our enjoyment, we finished with brandy and chocolate soufflé.  Marvelous. Everything was just right.  Not an inexpensive dinner option but wonderful for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I had dinner here while visiting the Biltmore, nice ambiance, on the dark side, sat at the bar and ordered the meatloaf, a big portion but a bit too sweet for my taste why they put so much ketchup in it I don't get. My salad was good, dessert totally sucked,  I ordered the carrot cake and it looked like it came from a super market, what they dont realize is it should be served room temperature not out of the fridge, or it should be warmed. Still, for a five star resort the dessert was pretty sad looking and tasting... I might try this place again during another visit, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Best food ever, service was amazing. Definitely an experience to eat here. The chefs are fantastic they change the menu weekly so you'll never have the same experience eating here. Prefect spot for special occasions."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried their 5 course taste menu. $135 per person and so much fun! We loved it and my husband is not very adventurous with food. We each got different dishes as well, so we really got to try 10 different items. We only had 1 request of no liver."}
{"text":"I had dinner here one night and the sunday brunch buffet another day. The brunch is so worth it. They could charge double and it would be worth it. You get crab claws, oysters, shrimp, muffins, mini bagels, 2 diff types of salad, cheeses, desserts and more to choose from on the buffet tables. PLUS included in the price you get to choose from 5 hot item of the menu that they make in the kitchen. You can choose as many as you want and it had items like pork belly eggs benedict, mini waffle, mini pancake, ect."}
{"text":"Everything we had was really good but pricey. Great service, superb Beef Wellington. The lobster Thermidor was good but not worth the $50 bucks as the portions were limited. Would I go again? Yes and I'd order the chocolate soufflé a hundred times over!"}
{"text":"We had the Sunday brunch.  It includes an entree and a seafood, appetizer, ad dessert  buffet.  The buffet was better than the entrees but everything was very fresh.  Drinks are very expensive but what the heck, you're at the Biltmore.  It is definitely Oooooooold money here.  We loved it. Woof!"}
{"text":"My fiance and me have been to the Sunday brunch for the third time now and every single time it was simply perfect. The buffet has a nice selection of fresh sea food (including oysters, shrimps, smoked salmon...), deli meats, delicious cheeses, antipasti, salads, fresh fruit, yogurt and granola. Two more buffets offer pastries and baked goods, as well as an amazing selection of different desserts. The buffets alone would be worth the visit, but Wright's also offers five hot freshly prepared seasonal entrees (menu changes weekly) to order, as many as you want, included in the price. We never had a single entree that was not good. The eggs Benedict were always the highlight but the other entrees don't have to hide either. Today one entree was a marinated rib eye steak that had me raving for hours. All entrees are the perfect size to really enjoy it but small enough to make sure you can try them all (plus trips to the buffet). I wish my stomach was bottomless so I could eat every single thing on the buffet (not that I didn't try...). Of course, not every bite we had swept us off our feet but that's due to personal taste, not due to the execution, the latter is always high class cuisine.  Speaking of bottomless, coffee, tea, water and juices are also included in the price. For a few bucks more you can enjoy unlimited mimosas and sparkling wine too.  The service is exquisite. You don't have to wait long for your entrees (and the waiting time can be well spend with trips to the buffet), glasses and cups are never empty, and every piece of silverware is immediately replaced after use. The waiters are extremely friendly, professional and attentive without bothering you every few minutes interrupting you while eating.  The experience of the Wright's Sunday Brunch is well worth the money, we can just recommend it to everyone who appreciates high class cuisine and excellent service for a decent price. Make sure you make a reservation beforehand as the brunch seems to be very popular!"}
{"text":"I'm glad the hotel gave me a $100 to try this restaurant....  They claimed it was one of the top 8 restaurants in AZ and I must say, I was disappointed. The price vs. what you get is way way off.  Fancy food, yes, but you pay for the actual food and I must say I want not impressed.  The bisque, was average, the stark was small and average, the dessert was awesome, but overall it was not a top spot for me and I doubt I will be back.  Sorry, a miss in my eyes... and my belly agrees."}
{"text":"Our experience was at a private event in the private dining room just across from Wrights Bar. This is the \"formal\" upscale restaurant at the resort.   It was a four course event, with plenty of Pinot Noir and Cabernet flowing to lubricate conversation among the guests, and to accompany the outstanding meal.  Our server was a gem, being scout, server, tour guide - James - at one point walking me through the lobby regaling stories of Prohibition activity at the resort.   The meal itself was perfect, topped off with a soufflé to knock your socks off.   The setting was great, the food A+ and the service top notch. Would expect more of the same in the main dining room."}
{"text":"Supposedly the \"premier\" dining venue of the Arizona Biltmore, the \"premier\" part was missing. The waiter was a bit too casual in his style in this type of venue and was never around when you needed a new drink or had a question. Their version of Onion Soup was a slice of cheese in the middle of a large shallow bowl containing a fairly bland broth. The lamb sirloin on black garlic risotto was tough and tasteless. The risotto was undercooked. The halibut Oscar did not have much flavor. We don't mind paying for a really nice meal. This was not a really nice meal and was therefore way overpriced."}
{"text":"Poor Brunch Selections. The food and staff were mostly top quality. The Sunday brunch was excessively overpriced at $41.95 for cold selections and a choice of three pre-determined savory hot \"small plates\". Our choices were Eggs Benedict (good), Pulled Pork with Pear Chutney (ok) and Beef Brisket with a Pepper Hash. The brisket was tough and dry. There were no omelets or carving stations. No bacon, sausages or vegetable dishes ( with the exception of the cold grilled assortment on the buffet). The only salad choices were a premade Caprese and a premade Romaine.   We asked for a children's selection and were told there was not one. \"Brunch was brunch\". They also had a nice cold seafood tray with crab claws, shrimp and oysters. I was disappointed to see the accompanients for caviar but no caviar. Will not return for lack of value."}
{"text":"WOW. OMG. LUV. BIG LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. WRIGHTS...Get yourself to Wrights' and enjoy it right now. Life is short, Wright's is amazing and you don't want to miss it. The restaurant is sublime, the architecture is stunning, even if you've never noticed the walls around you before, when you are sitting in this restaurant you will. The food is magnificent, silly good. The selection is perfect. The summer tasting menu was delicious and gave you a taste of the abilities of a staggeringly good chef and well executed kitchen. We had scallop appetizers which were so amazing in a lemon butter sauce that I questioned why I did not eat scallops in lemon butter sauce everyday. I had the tasting menu, my husband had the feature - a pork chop with veggies and potatoes. My tasting was equally homey - chicken and rice and it was earth shatteringly good. I question why I bother going into my kitchen when such simple food can be made this good, why do I bother to cook myself...which brings me to price. Watch out,  wrights' is not cheap, not value, not frugal, no, no, no. You pay full freight at Wrights. The concept of wine by the glass, not so much here. You will be paying 'bout $18 for a glass, it will be awesome and you will recognize the fact that the wine you are drinking is never sold by the glass, hence the price but it will be just about $18...the tasting menu is $25 and you can fit all 3 items on a small dinner plate- not filling up at this rate. Going full boar, my husband's meal with 3 beers, a $12 salad, a $35 main course and $12 souffle is more in line with the cost of sublime eating.  Go for it, get the second job it is all worth it !!!"}
{"text":"I brought my mom for a special birthday brunch because even as natives we'd never had a chance to stop by and visit this amazing property and I'm so glad we finally did.  The service and food were both amazing. If you're looking for a great place to take out of town guests for brunch this is a great idea. Especially in the spring when you can set outside and really enjoy the weather and grounds.   My favorite thing was that there was no waffle station or omelet bar or anything else like that. The buffet is for cold items and desserts. No hot stuff. In addition to that you can pick up \"hot plates\" which you order and are delivered directly to your table. I LOVE this! Also enjoy a few breakfast cocktails - you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant with hotel restaurants but this was a good one.   Service was really good and so was the food. Foie gras was delicious. The pork loin and short rib bread pudding were excellent.  Although I am not a big fan of it, my friends thought that the soufflé was also delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner for two here last night.   Delicious Beef Wellington.  Delicious chocolate something for dessert.  Great ambiance and location.   Attentive service.  Recommended."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for my birthday. She was planning on returning to the Royal Palms (T. Cooks) that we enjoyed so much last time, but they are closed for remodeling right now. I guess everything happens for a reason. We were VERY happy with Wright's! The service, food, ambience...EVERYTHING was OUTSTANDING! We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great brunch. Service was unbelievable; attentive but not hanging over you. Portions are perfect for sampling without the guilt of wasting a large slice or entree.  Food selection was very good. Choice of 5 entrees included in the brunch. An overall great experience."}
{"text":"We just had an amazing meal. My husband and I had the tasting menu with wine pairing. Other than dessert we were each given a different course. All were amazing. John.  Our server was a delight. For those of you who live in the area, check them out. The value per dollar is great."}
{"text":"Very nice dining experience.  We had dinner on a Thursday night and started with the small order of the escargot cassoulet, I don't normally like escargot, but this was amazing and I wished we'd ordered the large.  Then we split a large Waldorf salad, it is made table side and it's a generous portion.  For entree's, I had the veal and crab, which was delicious while my boyfriend had the crispy redfish and he really enjoyed that.  We were too full to order dessert, but they did box up their cotton candy for us to enjoy later as well as two boxes of their delicious fresh baked bread.  We had the garlic focaccia and the chocolate cherry."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! From the beautiful grounds and surroundings to the attention of the staff right when we walked through the doors. My husband ordered the venison tomahawk, I had the Sea Bass and my boss had the lamb. Everything was superb, from the way they were prepared right down to the presentation. The lemon drop Martinis were great also, along with our blueberry cotton candy to end our fabulous meal and experience. This is not a place that is an everyday out to eat kind of place, but for special occasions it can't be topped."}
{"text":"The on-property fine dining option at the Biltmore. We enjoyed great service from William who delivered oh-so-tasty Indian fry bread with a yummy cilantro salsa. The menu isn't huge but has good offerings. The venison and our prime rib was literally perfect. I'd skip over the salads as they were good just not inspired. Order a soufflé for dessert and you'll not be disappointed. Our server was delightful and a great face of the property. There when needed but not hovering. Polite but not stuffy. Lovely architecture lends to the experience and though a bit pricey the wine list is well built and matches the menu in fine fashion. Enjoy and cheers."}
{"text":"The food is just OK and the prices are way above where they should be for the caliber of food you get.  Had the wagyu steak and it was on par with Outback, but way more expensive.  We had a bunch of customers with us so I did not say anything.  The next night we had another dinner there.  I had the Seabass.  Once agin ok, but dry and over priced."}
{"text":"Dined here 3 times and it has always been exceptional. I love the fact that they feature a game selection every night of the week, along with a constantly revolving tasting menu. Wine list is terrific and the food is very fresh. I understand they buy from farmers directly, rather than a food service company, which makes it A+ in my book.  Plus the Biltmore is just a beautiful place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a lovely meal here a few weeks ago with friends who were passing through town and stayed at the hotel. The service was 5-star all the way. The food was equally 5-star and I don't think I could find fault with a single thing about the whole evening. I ordered the salmon and it was divine. This place is top notch in my book and definitely a place to take someone you want to impress!"}
{"text":"The room was comfortable, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. However for the price the food was just ok. It was our anniversary so we expected some little treat with a candle at the end but what they brought was a plate of pink cotton candy. Holly tooth decay Batman!"}
{"text":"Birthday celebration for my 82 year old father who loved the seafood buffet!  My mother kept getting the pancakes with blackberry curd because they were so delicious! My 60 something hubby and 20 something \"kids\", while admiring the sophisticated options, would have preferred some basic choices, though no complaints on the \"all you can drink\" $8 mimosas and the dessert buffet!"}
{"text":"Decent food and good service but way over priced fit what it was. Price fix was an ok deal; wine pairings were a steal based on normal prices and delivered via healthy tableside pour.  More of a nicer hotel restaurant than a special occasion place. Maybe this experience was bent because we went for dinner, not brunch?"}
{"text":"They knew. They knew we were a rowdy, tipsy, cuss strewn restaurant gang. And they put us in back. Didn't matter. The entire room was magnificent. Carved concrete block. Mission style furniture blended with contemporary. Three ambiguously sexual servers. Really. How can you tell now days? But the food. The art on a plate. Sublime. And I don't even know what sublime means. I heard it on TV once. Just sounds good. Like the food I fed my pie hole last night. Perfectly seared sea scallop with a corn succotash, a Caesar salad so perfect AND served in a baked Parmesan crisp. That means, my dairy loving friends, that you consume the salad and then eat the bowl. Just like freakin' Dairy Queen. Damn! Filet Mignon, demi glace, baby veggies and the cutest little Dutch potatoes. Ever. Chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate. Dessert was a chocolate cup with house made vanilla bean ice cream, crisp banana wafers with milk chocolate and German chocolate mousse cake. Toe curling happiness.It was so good I had start cutting myself. And pull out my hair. Both very trendy disorders. I hadn't had Cain Cuvee in years and it's great to know it's a meritage you can stick with. It was a magical evening. Oddly none of the Biltmore staying, tattoo adorned (yes it was indeed an interesting and large fellowship), churchgoers were dining here. Rumor has it they were eating Fritos, watching reruns of Highway to Heaven and deciding if the croquet field looked like a crucifix."}
{"text":"Probably the worst money I've ever spent at a restaurant.  $265 for two people, no drinks.  This Easter brunch buffet was just awful.  Mushy vegetables, sparse selection, omelette station was out of everything.  Something they were calling \"Heirloom Beans\" was a dark pile of unrecognizable ick. Oh, also very weak coffee.  On top of everything, they charged a 18% gratuity-for a buffet! Very disappointing for anyplace, but especially The Biltmore.  Never again."}
{"text":"Feeling ripped off. Went to brunch today at Wrights. Disappointment can't even touch how I felt. Brunch is $49.50. They had a fruit bar. (My husband doesn't do fruits). There was a cheese and cracker bar. (My husband doesn't do cheese and crackers ) There was a seafood bar with shrimp, salmon and crab tails. (My husband doesn't do seafood). There was a table with small prepared salads in bowls with a cherry tomato and a crouton. And other plates of one heirloom tomato and a piece of basil. (Aaaaaand you guessed it. My husband doesn't do veggies.) There WAS a dessert bar. He ate many desserts.   The notable one was the macaroons. They were great.   They have a small menu of 5 items which are considered small plates. You can get one of each. Or 5 of one thing and 2 of another. (Check out other reviews for the pictures people have posted on brunch items)  They were: 1. Eggs Benedict was a QUARTER of an English muffin with the egg and I think some prosciutto.  2. The bacon waffle. A QUARTER of a waffle with bacon bits cooked inside. Not very bacony. (He had one of these) 3. A teeny piece of mahi mahi.  4. 2 pancakes the size of the bottom of a soda can  5. Chorizo something or other. Can't remember. (He had one of these)   That was it. No carving station. No Create your own omelette bar. There was no bacon. No sausage. No eggs. No potatoes. There was NO MEAT!! SERIOUSLY!!! It was not a vegetarian buffet brunch either. Never ever going back.  It was one of those: stop at Mickie D's for an Egg McMuffin on the way home situations. Youuuuu know what I'm talking about..."}
{"text":"This place exceeds any expectation I ever had for brunch. The food was fresh, the service was amazing. When you eat at Wright's you get so much for your money. You will leave this place satisfied beyond belief. By far the BEST eggs benedict in all of phoenix/scottsdale. The breakfast buffet that is included with your meal was amazing. It is pricey but so worth it."}
{"text":"An outstanding eatery.  Exquisite Cuisine served in a truly comfortable relaxed environment by attentive servers soothed by a marvelous pianist.  The Special of the Day Halibut with a unique ratatouille sauce was wonderful.  You'll have to save up for this one, though"}
{"text":"For the record... I really wanted to like this place and I was excited for this meal at Wrights based on the reviews. We live on the property but we have never dined at the hotel.  The property is amazing, the hotel is beautiful, as is the restaurant.  I had the the Beef Wellington, but I would say this particular dish was more of a faux Wellington. Some might call it de-constructed, but this was more like cutting corners to me.  I would best describe it as Choice grade Filet with puff pastry on the side. The presentation was beautiful, I will say that, but it lacked the authenticity I was expecting. I'm all for creativity if the taste is there, but it was just ok. As I've said in other reviews maybe I've been ruined by City Hall and Durrants but it was just not up to par.  My boyfriend is a picky eater, sometimes he will agree to try a place just because I want to try it and sometimes we will have to ask for the kitchen to accommodate his affliction. In this case he just wanted a plain old filet, nothing else on the plate. Some kitchens don't like to make menu modifications, I respect that and their process, but I asked as soon as we sat down if they could prepare just a filet, nothing else, and the waiter said yes. When it came time to order my boyfriend asked for just a \"Filet on a plate, nothing else\" and the waiter then tried to convince him to take dish as a beef wellington, which he did not want, then with other garnishes and sides, so we had to say \"no thank you\" to his suggestions three times, and at that point it felt like he was actually judging us or frustrated with us for some reason. He took the order and didn't ask for the temperature of the steak so we had to call it out to him as he was walking away.   The interactions with the server from that point were just awkward, he communicated with us in very few words, and there were a couple of times where he came to the table and just stood there like he was expecting us to speak to him first. It was weird, a bit creepy, and not the fine dining experience we are used to. Maybe he was having an off night but it made for an uncomfortable experience almost like we were putting him out, or possibly not racking up a big enough tab.   The food arrived in the appropriate amount of time, they filled the water glasses and refilled drinks in perfect tune but the server/guest relationship was just off.  We were uncomfortable and so we skipped dessert and I almost never pass up Creme Brûlée, but we just wanted to get out of there.   The cotton candy at the end was a nice touch. Can't say I would go back here again, maybe for brunch. I was just underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque sparked my interest so I decided to dine here solo while my husband was at a business dinner. What a beautiful, charming and unique ambiance. The architecture took me to another century and the views of the garden softly lit at night were cozy. I appreciate the Stickley furniture filling the main dining area and alcoves too.   They have a few mocktails on the drink menu, which was perfect for this future mama to be flying solo for what will be the last time for a while. The Nola Mule was great - perfectly sweetened with pineapple. The bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and arrived warm from the oven served with herb butter - delish. Then for my simple meal of lobster bisque: the broth was smooth and flavorful with a nice amount of lobster. Served in a soup bowl with a puff pastry on top, which helped soak up the broth do that none was left behind. Excelent. The chef brought a smoked salmon with kumquat vinaigrette which was very nice!  Then arrived green apple cotton candy courtesy of the chef as well. I'm glad I chose not to order dessert! This was the perfect treat to end a magical evening and transported me yet to another time and place. How can you forget the way cotton candy melts in your mouth?! Delightful. What an amazing meal for a relatively small bill for such a swanky restaurant. Would love the chance to dine here again and anticipate it would be another special evening."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely amazing. The hostess, server assistants, and server were attentive, knowledgeable, quick and so so nice. The location is beautiful and the restaurants interior is breathtaking as well. This place gets 3 stars because of the food.. everything was just OK. Nothing stood out. The chocolate soufflé tasted like the boxed chocolate pudding. Presentation was pretty. Most people are going out to eat for the food, not for the service. Maybe brunch would be better?"}
{"text":"Amazing! Everyone was so nice the atmosphere was fun and very welcoming. Kinda hard to find it. But over all the most important part is the food was amazing"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was perfect!!! Cold Buffet with warm individual orders that were the perfect size to order 3 or 4. Coffee was excellent as was the service. Our Server, John was there when needed and anticipated our every need. I would go back again and again, except I couldn't keep the weight off...lol Highly recommended!!!"}
