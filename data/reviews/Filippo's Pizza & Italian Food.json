{"text":"Fantastic service and owned by great people. Best authentic Italian restaurant in the area. 10/10"}
{"text":"Love this place.  As a point of reference I think that Monicals, Pizza Hut, etc., are all garbage.  Originally from the Chicago suburbs, I've eaten my fair share of pizza.  This stuff is in my top 5.  As mentioned in an other review, the sauce is amazing.  Not sure what they they put in it, but it's good stuff.  Crust is medium thickness cooked to a golden brown every time.  And they don't skimp on the cheese or toppings.  I'd highly recommend this place.  Two other things:   + They only take cash/check.  + They have a gluten free crust that my wife can eat!"}
{"text":"We love this place.   Love it.  Their pizza sauce is amazing.  Their pastas are amazing as well!  Kid-friendly.  Take-out.  Dine it. Its all great!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. My go-to ordering out option in town! The highlight for me is definitely the fresh ingredients --- can't go wrong with adding lots of veggies to your pizza here!   I haven't tried any of the sandwiches or pasta options yet.   FYI -- Filippo's only takes cash or check."}
{"text":"The pizza is ok, but nothing special. Not a particularly flavorful dough, not baked in a wood fire oven, and just standard toppings. The price was great, though."}
{"text":"Filippos is a fantastic local pizza place.  Easily the best within 25 miles in any direction, maybe further.  Highly recommend the thick pizza, the sauce is unique and the best part, don't be afraid to ask for extra.  A must eat if through the area!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for Filippo's!  The pizza is great, it by far beats any chain pizza joints.  Produce is fresh, however they use canned mushrooms unfortunately."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Best in the town for sure. Very friendly wait staff and quick order to table turn around. Sausage pizza is unique and good. The sauce is a bit on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Enjoy the sauce. Though the crust has a good texture, it is a little flavorless for me. It sort of tastes like unseasoned dough."}
{"text":"Filippos in Monticello is by far the best one to choose from. The pizza, pasta, and salad is extremely fresh and delicious. The people and service is fantastic. We travel 25 mins and its far worth the drive."}
{"text":"I've been living in central Illinois for 4 years and this is the best pizza I've had from the region. The flavor authenticity was a welcome surprise. The crust is a homemade, crackery foundation for lots of real cheese. Tons of toppings are available to choose from too. This is always a huge plus for me since finding a nice vegetable selection can be near impossible. The sauce Is a little sweet for my taste, but if you choose garlic as a topping you really have nothing to complain about.   My only qualm with the restaurant was the service. Our waitress seemed to be high school aged and not too attentive (no refills, no serving utensils, only one follow up and that was to drop off the check..). I'm pretty patient when it comes to poor service, but I have no doubt that if we approached her she would have jumped to assist us. The establishment was very clean and well maintained. Also, tastefully decorated without being over the top.   So if you want a great, authentic pizza in a no frills setting, I would recommend. I actually can't wait to go back. I'm so happy I gave this place a shot."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the pizza and restaurant. Food is fresh and different than other chain pizzerias. Defintely worth a stop if in Mahomet and Monticello!"}
{"text":"First note : CASH/CHECK ONLY.  For such a small town, this place is certainly an amazing addition to anyone's list of places to eat. I absolutely loved every bite of the massive dishes they serve. We took the spaghetti with mushrooms and the veal parmigian. Unlike many Italian places, the cooks here season the dish properly, and so the taste is really something. I'm a little sad that the veal didn't actually taste anything like veal, but rather like breaded chicken. Outside of that, the pasta was perfect, and here's the kicker: free garlic bread with your order. The bread is ASTOUNDING, so make sure you savor that. Definitely coming back on our next trip to Allerton."}
{"text":"They do NOT take cards. While you can find this info on their yelp page if you are motivated to look in that specific place (which especially takes some digging if you are on mobile), it is not disclosed in any other way as far as I can tell. The gentleman helping me was particularly aggressive about it, rather than apologetic, when I came to pickup. I was personally taken aback.  The pizza was fine. Sauce and cheese are top notch. Like, really good. And the tomatoes were very yummy. But I did not like their thin crust at all. I would call it hard, not crunchy. And the mushrooms seemed like canned mushrooms. Big minus for me."}
