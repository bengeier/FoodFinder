{"text":"The place is very nice, clean and i was greeted with friendly smiles. I've tried their pork belly bun and laksa which both tasted great. The price is affordable!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Singapore Noodles were delicious as was the Sweet and Juicy Chicken. Ordered to go and food was ready in 15-20 minutes. While waiting, we were served complimentary Edamame, which was a nice surprise. 
Establishment was clean and food was very good. Definitely returning in the future, we'll be regulars for sure."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find! This place is run by a husband and wife. The husband is the chef and the wife runs the front. She is super friendly and helps to make suggestions and answer questions. 

We got a couple appetizers, the tofu and the veggies, the tofu was wonderful. Silky tofu with a light fried batter and a delicious mouth watering peanut sauce to dip it in. A couple orders of that and i could eat it as an entire meal. 

For entrees we got the Dan dan noodles, which was a thicker noodle, kind of like ramen consistency and we mixed it in with the provided peanut sauce. It was different than what I normally eat, but so glad I tried it and will be ordering it again. We also got the crispy chow mein and the regular chow mein. Both were excellent, sauces were good and ratio of toppings to noodles was spot on. 

For dessert we shared a mango sticky rice. We were so full. But it was so delicious! Wonderfully sticky, the mango was ripe and sweet and the extra sauce I wanted to drink. If you don't like sweet, hust don't put the sauce on. 

The best part is we got great food, great customer service and a great price. Worth it!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place and wanted to try it. I was in a hurry one night so I called ahead for a to-go order, and I have to tell you it was delicious. I was also greeted very warmly by the owner, and the staff could not have been friendlier.

So if a place has great food, great service, and you feel welcome, I can't help but give this place 5 Stars. If you haven't been yet, I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"It's great when you find a place that has good food and caring staff. Thanks for making us welcome! We'll be back again soon"}
{"text":"The service here was good and I did like the dumplings. It didn't seem as if they had the option to steam them until I asked. The other food, such as the fried rice, was just OK. The baos, which I normally love, had really tough, beef jerky like meat that I ended up pulling the meat out just trying to bite it. The fried tofu was very bland with no seasoning. They provided peanut sauce, which I don't like, with it, but still they could've seasoned it a bit with something like soy sauce."}
{"text":"If you love Asian food, you'll want to check out Sweet & Spicy. The name of the business speaks for itself as majority of their entrees are incorporated with sweet and spicy flavors, which grabbed my attention because I love them both. Upon entering, Mama Lee was welcoming and friendly. She serviced us herself and recommended the top favorites in the menu. She was very sweet and took great care of us. 

We ordered two of their appetizers, the shaking chicken and sweet & spicy wings (5 pc). Both were good, but not enough for me to want to order this again as it is basic chicken wings and fried chicken. As for the main entrees we've ordered, the Laksa Noodle soup and the Sweet & Juicy Chicken is a MUST try. I was excited about the Laksa soup the most since several people talked highly of it. They're right, I loved it. It had loads of flavors. The rich coconut curry creaminess with a bit of spice was a perfect remedy for the cold weather and to my stomach. The Sweet & Juicy chicken tastes similar to orange chicken, but way better. It was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy in the inside. Mama Lee's Chow Mein reminded me of Pad-see-ew (Thai) because of the thick flat noodles with eggs, and vegetables. Usually I know chow mein is used with thinner noodles. I'm sure that's the Asian fusion coming into play. It was delicious nonetheless. 

The restaurant is a decent size. Decor is nice and modern. The prices on the menu were inexpensive ranging from $3.99-$7.99 only. We were able to order 7 food items for under $45 with tax! Each dish can feed up to two people. But we were a party of 3 with 7 dishes hehe. What can I say, I like options! To top it all off, Mama Lee gave my daughter a complimentary Mango Pudding and wow that was delicious! Overall, the service and prices won me over. Thank you Mama Lee and the rest of the crew for your hospitality."}
{"text":"My family and I went searching for an amazing food spot ane this is the place! With a low cost but still able to have high quality food, this has exceeded my wildest dreams! The resturaunt is welcoming and the staff is even more so. Mama and Papa Lee, the owners, were kind and made the atmosphere wonderful! I highly suggest this location if your looking for asian fusion food!"}
{"text":"This place is a delight! Hard to believe it has been open less than a month! It is a nice atmosphere and the place is very clean! The service was prompt and very helpful! Ask Mama Lee for her recommendations, you won't be sorry!! We tried a lot of different dishes (as we had a large party and wanted to share): calamari, shaker chicken, miso ramen, laksa noodles, dan dan noodle, green tea ice cream, mango sticky rice and mango pudding! Nothing was subpar, everything was very flavorful and fresh! I honestly believe the price is low for the quality of food but Mama Lee said she wanted it that way so everyone can try it! You can't miss out on a place like this with so much heart!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we're here and we came of a friend recomendation.. we're glad to find this hidden gem. the Laksa noodle keep dragging us back here lol.. we tried Singaporean noodle, shaking chicken  and Mango sticky rice too today. Everything was excellent and most importantly my 5 yrs old son loves them and wants to be back for more. Great food and great pricing.. plenty of parking space and great atmosphere.."}
{"text":"Great little spot! The prices are inexpensive, portions and sharable and flavors are all there! I can not recommend enough to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Such a great place and everyone was super friendly, the food is the best around. Mom and pop restaurant with the art and love and cooking who also really cares about their customers"}
{"text":"i really noticed the good customer service of the people working here, they always apologize for the wait, food is alright, place is clean. Will definitely come back for more :)"}
{"text":"Came here to pick up some lunch when my friend had found this while I was giving suggestions on what to eat for lunch. I had never known about this place opening up so close to me (about 1 mile away) ! 

Located on the NorthWest corner of Flamingo and Durango, it sits facing south, west of the CareNow Urgent Care. 

Decent sized restaurant with an open style kitchen, with a fairly small menu. 

10 \"Appetizer\" including Sweet & Spicy wings, edamame, poached broccoli, vegetable spring rolls, green salad bowl, calamari, dancing tofu, homemade little dumplings, braised pork belly buns, and shaking chicken

5 \"Wok Fried Noodle\" including Sweet & Spicy, Mama Lee Chow Mein, Pork Belly Udon, Crispy Egg Noodle, and Singapore Noodle

7 \"Rice\" including Sweet & Spicy fried rice, Mama Lee Fried Rice, Lychee Massaman Curry, Spicy Rice Bowl, Signature Rice Bowl, House Curry, and Sweet & Juicy Chicken

9 \"Soup Noodles\" including Shrimp Noodle Soup, Tempura Udon, Laksa Noodle, Miso Ramen, Shoyu Ramen, Beef Pho, Dan Dan Noodle, Fish Ball Soup Noodle, and Crispy Fish Noodle Soup

4 \"Desserts\" including Grass Jelly Lychee, Mango Pudding, Bobo Chacha, and Warm Mango Sticky Rice

We had both gotten Dan Dan Noodles and Braised Pork Belly Buns to share. 

Dan Dan Noodles include garlic ground pork, egg white noodles, cucumber topped with a sesame paste sauce. 

Very simple dish. Sesame paste is a staple for the base of a dan dan noodles. Wish they offered a spicier version or way to make it spicy. Could use more of the cucumbers as well. The dan dan noodles became fairly one noted with out the freshness due to lack of cucumbers, and other spices. Still a decent dish and amount for the price though. 

As I took it to go, it was served in a black plastic container with a clear lid. I believe these are microwavable. Good quality take out containers. 

Braised Pork Belly Buns (2 Pieces) comes with pickled cucumbers and carrots with a sweet soy reduction. The pork belly buns was nice to have the pickled cucumbers and carrots as it helps bring some acidity and brightness to the buns. Unfortunately the pork belly isnt as soft as I had hoped. Though it may have been because I did take it to go. Comes with a few of those shrimp crackers on the side too XD 

Overall, ok place. Good to know there's a chinese place nearby thats decent where i don't have to travel down to Chinatown for. 2 noodle dishes and appetizer for less than 20 bucks."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my husband. I try several appetizer and Laksa noodle. I really enjoy all of them . This  place is hidden gem. The food delicious , great service . Price affordable. Can not wait to come back and try other things from menu .... This place must put in your list\" Must try list !!!!\"."}
{"text":"Unbelievably reasonable price for what it is.
I almost do not wish this place to be popular so that they will raise the price. 

Anyhow, their weekend Menu Hainan chicken was as good as Flock and Fowl and neighbor Nuro. And more reasonably priced. Their potstickers are good with special dark sticky soy sauce which I have never seen anywhere else. Vegetables egg rolls were hot for long time. Singapore noodle were decent and could have add even more curry powder. 

I want to try dam dam noodles next time even though I usually do not choose gluten meals."}
{"text":"Had the dancing tofu which was good. Also had the laksa which I was a huge fan of. I love that the prices are doable and the decor is nice. Plus service was friendly. Enjoyable place, will come back."}
{"text":"Owner was very nice, and they have great customer service! Food was really good, would recommend the sweet and spicy wings and specialty rice bowl! Definitely coming back here! :-)"}
{"text":"This food is really great!  I also thought the over all service was outstanding. It was a little spicy but on a cold day like today you could not ask for a better meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Asian infusion livers. The food is made fresh, tastes great and leaves you wanting more. The staff is very nice and welcoming and willing to make changes so the food will be the way you want it.
All in all it was a great meal and we sure will be coming back for more"}
{"text":"The food is awesome!!! The sweet and juicy chicken is phenomenal!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Quick. Good service. Nice prices!

The pork belly buns were very tasty! Would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Return visit for dinner to this newly found favorite. Tried new dishes and was not disappointed.  Everything was tasty,  hot and fresh.  Quick and pleasant service.  Good and clean atmosphere with new furnishings.  We ordered chicken wings, shakin chicken,  Chinese Broccoli and Singapore noodles; all were well presented and prepared. Would recommend."}
{"text":"You live in Summerlin and you're craving Asian food, but you don't want to drive to Chinatown and fight for parking, and you don't want to shell out a bunch of scratch. Head to Sweet & Spicy! 

Menu is well organized with a good amount of variety, but they stand out for their good-sized portions and low prices. Apps are around $5, like for their pork belly bao (2 per order), good for sharing. Noodle dishes are under $10, and you will have leftovers. They even have a couple of desserts. 

My meal of bao, Chinese broccoli, and dan dan noodles was right around $20 WITH tax and tip, and served as dinner one day and lunch the next. Not a bad deal. I would love to see them add my favorite chili oil wontons to the menu!"}
{"text":"Five stars for Sweet & Spicy. Food is delicious. Great variety, everything is affordable, and the portion sizes allow you to experiment. Most importantly, fantastic service. The owners came to the table and thanked us for our business. Will return soon! 

Favorite menu items: flying tofu, laksa, lychee curry, and the mango pudding."}
{"text":"I tried this place with my husband and we both enjoyed their delicious food and their service.

We started with some appetizers like the pork bun with teriyaki sauce was good, their calamari has a good seasoned breadings and the one that I truly enjoyed was their peanut sauce from their dancing tofu. I kid you not, their peanut sauce is amazing and I asked for an extra sauce so I can just dip my calamari and pork bun as well. 

Aside from the appetizers I ordered their Laksa soup and hubby tried their Miso Ramen. In their Ramen soup you have the option to combine the chicken and pork so we did that and my husband told me that he liked it better with just the pork. I had their Laksa soup and it was truly delicious and such a comforting bowl of soup. 

I honestly told one of the server that I'll probably need a to go box for my soup because we've ordered 3 appetizers and mostly I ate all of them. But boy I was wrong because as soon as start eating and enjoying my Laksa I didn't realize that my bowl was already empty. Hahaha!

If you want to have a delicious Asian food and experienced a home cooked meal, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Super good! Good atmosphere and the store owner nice is really sweet and patient at explaining what's on the menu  She recommended me the Laksa dish and I loved it! High quality food for a cheap price"}
{"text":"When I first walked in the door I was welcomed and I have to say the customer service was fantastic. They were patient with me ordering my food. Once I placed my order it didn't take very long until I started to get my food and start eating! The food was delicious and how cheap it was for such a delicious plate. Very good place to eat but overall, the customer service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"What a treat!! Family owned and operated, momma Lee is and has the most friendly staff! The food and flavors, out way anywhere at this price point!! Their lunch specials are $8.99, entree include; 2 spring rolls, and egg drop soup, which has better flavor then anywhere else I've been!! The variety is very unique, having everything from Ramen, Pho, different rice, and noodle dishes. I can't wait to go back and try their braised pork belly buns, and so much more!!"}
{"text":"I love supporting new local restaurants. The service was great but he food was mediocre. We ordered a few apps the laksa noodles & the lychee massamsn curry. Mostly disappointed in the lack of flavor in the massaman curry. It was very watered down could barely taste the curry. Will i be back? Probably not. Nothing really stood out to me or made me crave it."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Singaporean fusion cuisine. Love the food.  We tried a cross section of appetizers and main dishes. Everything was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Eh it was ok nothing special, I got the sweet and spicy chicken, to be honest couldn't tell the difference between that and panda express"}
{"text":"The 4 and 1/2 * average for this place is absurd. I had dinner here last night, and the food we had was all fine. The Dan Dan noodles, the shaking chicken, the pork buns, the crispy noodle. All were fine, none were bad in any way. The service is friendly and the prices are pretty reasonable. Overall, the place is just fine. I would never make a trip here to go out of my way. It's above a standard Chinese takeout restaurant, but it is a far cry from any of the best Asian restaurants you'll find. They attempt to do all things for all people by being some kind of Pan Asian restaurant where you can get things from all over, but none of it is spectacular."}
{"text":"Great food! Even better service. We keep coming back and each time we bring new family and friends with us. You have to try."}
{"text":"Family own and operated. Homestyle cooking,  amazing service from the owners. We had 4 orders and all came out very good. Definitely a go to spot for us. Just absolutely love this place .."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new tonight & this is what we decided. We are not disappointed at all! Everything was super flavorful, the restaurant was very clean & the staff was friendly. All the appetizers were delicious; we tried the chicken wings, dumplings and calamari. Loved them all including the sauces accompanying them. We both ordered the spicy rice bowl, mine with shrimp and chicken.. his with beef and chicken. It was good, except the rice was a little saturated nearing the end. Next time I want to try the sweet and spicy noodles instead. Come try them out!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a new Thai restaurant to try. Was not disappointed.  I always order curry and mine was fresh and tasty. It was on the spicy side but they brought me a little bowl of cilantro to cool it off! Yum ! Hubby ordered Crispy Noodle Chicken. Delish! Mild with fresh greens. Will come again. Best part was the sweet decor!"}
{"text":"Calamari, dancing tofu, satay chicken, dan dan noodle, bak kuh teh(weekend special), and shrimp noodle soup. 
For dessert we got mango pudding!
The owners were super friendly and welcoming as we walked in as usual. Food is cooked to perfection, a healthier selection for my taste. We will keep coming back to this establishment for as long as we live in Vegas. Our friend that is visiting loved it so much as well."}
{"text":"Read high reviews of this restaurant.   Service was good and friendly.   Food came quickly.   Maybe I tried the wrong food on the menu, but it was a little bland.  I'm usually not a food snob but as an asian,  I believe this food cater to more of non Asian."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this place for the first time last night. Place is nice, small and clean.  Very nice staff! Gave us free edamame menu doesn't have too much selection which is a good thing for me. Good and simple. Shaking chicken and pork buns are so good! Also had dan dan noodles and laksa noodles good serving size we still had some for to go. Will definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh. Tasted great. Best chow fun I've had in a long time. Was on my lunch break they got me my food so fast I had plenty of time to eat they were fairly busy.

New items on menu are bomb af"}
{"text":"Late post, but I came on Tuesday. I always have the signature rice bowl with the shaking chicken. It is sooooo good! Everything on the menu is delicious and the prices are perfect! I highly recommend this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"This is a nice little neighborhood gem.   I saw it on Yelp a week ago.  The pictures looked great.  So I decided to try it today.   I am having Laksa noodles and Dancing tofu.  Laksa noodles is delicious.  I had it in Asia last year. It tasted just as good.  Dancing tofu was on the sweeter side.  It was also tasty.   Fried on the outside and soft inside. Owner was super nice.  She came out to introduce herself.   The restaurant is clean and neat. I will definitely come back and take my 6 year old daughter with me."}
{"text":"This place is so good...highly recommended. Great food and great service. I ordered the Laksa soup with an added spice and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"When my sister and I found out there was a new place opening up that would serve Laksa (A noodle soup typically in a spicy broth served with shrimp and strands of eggs with some cilantro and bean sprouts and lemons or limes squeezed into it for that extra flavor since). Considering my sister has lived in Malaysia before and I have been there 5+ times and my mom makes her own Laksa which tastes very similar to the ones I order whenever I travel to Malaysia. However their Laksa here is very different. The Laksa we ordered here did not resemble any Laksa I have ever tasted which was a big letdown for my sister and a and huge disappointment for my mom considering she was born in Malaysia and has been to lots of different parts of Asia eating Laksa so she had high hopes. Instead, they used a broth that was very similar to Thai curry as it had a very strong coconut taste and used rice noodles which is uncommon but still one of the two noodle choices that traditional Laksa uses which is either rice noodle or vermicelli. If you're used to the traditional Malaysian Laksa and want to give this one a try I would give it chance. There's not much in it aside from rice noodles, a sweet coconut heavy flavored broth, slices of fish cake , and some bean sprouts. However, they do also have some other dishes that are worth trying. 

Appetizers: 

Shaking Chicken
- Almost like popcorn chicken as it is fried, crispy, and seasoned with salt and pepper.

Entrees:

Laksa
- Was told that it is Singaporean Laksa but tasted like Thai curry with an overwhelmingly amount of coconut milk with rice noodles, fish cake, bean sprouts and half an egg.

Fried Fish noodle soup
-nothing special, just fried fish fillets in a thick broth

Tempura Udon (for to-go)
-messed up our order and gave us pork belly buns. The pork belly buns were okay. The sauce seemed to overwhelm the taste of the pork belly as it is very sweet.

Overall, I would give this place a 3 out of 5 stars because they messed up our to-go order even though there was only a total of three tables and took a total of half an hour for our order to come out. The servers seemed new but I could see that they were trying and I hope that this place can improve on their service and not mess up orders as I see potential in this place considering the place is very clean and looks upscale, just needs to work on service.

NOTE: If you're a fan of shrimp crackers they come with every order!"}
{"text":"A cute little Chinese eatery.  The owners are so nice and patient with people who don't know what to order and have a million questions!  The food is great too.  They have a few different things to choose from and soups too.  Desserts are great too!  The plates aren't super huge so you can get a few things to share."}
{"text":"Sweet and Spicy it is for a quickie dinner yesterday since my husband is on-call tonight and needed to be near his computer. Good thing is, it was only half a mile away from where we live.

Walked in, small restaurant....sat ourselves down on an empty table that was open. Place is clean. Looking over yelp reviews to see what's good to order. 

We started with drinks. I got a Thai ice tea that had alot of milk in it but it was the usual taste like the can ones. My husband got regular ice tea since there was no sweet tea available. He ask for a simple syrup and the waitress gave him a clear coconut flavored syrup...lol...now his tea tasted like coconut water but that didn't ruin it. It wasnt bad either....hehe

Appetizers: yelp reviews said to order the pork braised buns that came with 2 and 2 shrimp chips on the side. That was good but i think I could have used some hoisin sauce in it. Also, the sweet and not so spicy wings...perfectly cooked and crisp on the outside. Not a wow factor but it was tasty. 

Entree: I ordered the spicy rice bowl with shrimp. It had green onions, bell peppers, and onions in it. Loved the flavor but they should have cut down a little on the sauce. It was too much. I wonder if i can have it on the side and mixed it to my liking. 

My husband had the same thing. It was called Signature rice bowl (?) but not as spicy and with teriyaki sauce and vegetables. He loved it. He would choose sweet over spicy btw.

Lastly, desserts...warm sticky rice with mango and coconut milk on the side. We had to take it to go and we ordered an extra one for my mother in law. Got home, ate it....oh, my...that was good but portion is small but worth it. 

Definitely be back!! Thanks Yelpers for helping us out on food choices. Happy Eats!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch after passing by their sign on Durango Dr. we were there at the time they just open so not that long to wait for food to come out. The restaurant is so clean and look grand new. The atmosphere is calm and nice but it would be better if they play some music in the restaurant. 

There were two different menus, one with picture and one with only words, I like the one with more picture since it easy and make me have faster decision on my choice of food. We ordered Dancing tofu, crispy noodle, chicken satay, lychee curry and lychee grass jelly for drink. The price is pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get. 

Food Review:
Dancing tofu: the tofu is soft and the sauce is sweet and creamy but kinda not mixing together with the taste
Crispy noodle: it look good and the texture is perfectly crispy but a little bit salty for my taste. 
Chicken satay: grilled to perfection, the sauce for this dish is very similar or maybe the same with the dancing tofu sauce. Cucumber and red onion come with it kinda not go good together with the chicken satay in some way. 
Lychee house curry: taste great, creamy and crunchy at the same time (roasted peanut) the best dish of my order
Lychee grass jelly: taste very similar with my hometown dessert which i really like it, sweet but not too much. The lady also gave me extra sugar in case I want it more sweet.


Customer service: the lady who served us is very friendly and nice, always checking on us. I would say they really care about customer."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! Plenty of food for a great price. Also, the food is delicious. Defiantly make this place part of your lunch rotation."}
{"text":"The food was ok for the price. I ordered pho and I got maybe three pieces of shrimp and two pieces of chicken. I've had pho with more flavor and a much larger quantity that what I got here but it was ok I guess. Would I go back? Maybe if my regular place wasn't open. The customer service was great btw. Hopefully next time there with be more flavor in the broth and a larger quantity."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot and find! Singaporean fusion. The must tries:
Fried tofu- delicately fried pillows of goodness in an addicting peanut sauce cooled by thin slices of cucumber.
Potstickers-homemade and nostalgic
Fried rice- its like taking the chili sauce from dim sum rolled into wok flavored rice with a fried egg on top!! 
Chow mein-Pad see ew married pad thai! 
Food is not heavy; price unbeatable!!

Sound basic....so not. The flavors are such a great combination of Thai and Chinese flavors."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Menu is customizable for vegans. I can't believe how affordable their prices are! My current go to place for Asian food."}
{"text":"It's rare to have low cost high quality exceed your expectations, but thats exactly what Momma and Papa Lee have done with Sweet & Spicy. An asian tapas house with a modern clean feel with an open kitchen, high ceilings and comfortable seating. The food was amazing. A perfect balance."}
{"text":"We tried the Lychee Massaman curry, which was outstanding with the sweet accent of the lychee fruit throughout.  Also had  the Sweet & Spicy Rice (teriyaki) Bowl w/chicken and the Sweet & Juicy chicken.  All were delish!  Finished with the mangom& sticky rice dessert.  Simple enough, but it got a rare \"WOW\" from the wife.  Service was prompt and attentive.  Serving size is generous and the prices are extremely reasonable.

I have already picked out my next 3 entrees for our next visit.  This one of those rare places where I want to try pretty much everything on the menu.  I am giving this one a \"Winner, winner, sweet & juicy chicken dinner\" and 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered:
Dan Dan Noodle
Chinese Broccoli

Ordered my food ToGo. This is the first time I've had Dan Dan Noodles ever. I'm not sure how \"authentic\" dan dan noodles should taste but their noodles were very good along with the poached Chinese broccoli. Staff was super friendly and the prices there are great."}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.

Price is insanely fair at Sweet & Spicy.  Less than $8 gets you a whopping bowl of soup.  Huge portions as well.  Lunch specials affordable at $9 with egg drop soup, roll, and drink included.  

I went with the laksa soup as it's the only time I've seen this dish in Vegas.  Really nice milky taste and spicy after adding peppers and their house spicy sauce.  The meat was fresh, though the egg a little undercooked.  The owner came around constantly to ask how the meal was and was extremely nice.  

Take out seemed to be the best mode of meal at Sweet & Sour, however.  Always taking calls and ready for orders in about 15 minutes or less.  Meal comes out fast and hot.  Sweet & Spicy is perfect for a lunch or take out meal.  Either, way try their laksa and more."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a delicious lunch of sweet and spicy noodles and spicy chicken with rice and broccoli. The restaurant is cute and the service was great!!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! The employees were so nice and the food is great! Not to mention that it was so greatly priced! Will continue to come back/keep ordering!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. I've been here twice only, but it's definitely a spot I enjoy eating at. They have a variety of really good entrees to choose from, friendly customer service, and they have weeknight and weekend specials!"}
{"text":"If you reading this, you better be coming here to try. Just finished my third meal here and I just went two days straight with my wife. 

Small spot, but the food packs a mean punch of flavor. They weren't lying about that sweet and spicy. It's sweet and spicy, bomb af. We got the chance to try their dancing tofu, fried wings, dumplings, calamari, Chinese broccoli, sweet n juicy chicken, spicy chicken bowl, dan dan noodles and lychee curry. Let's just say I'm half way with the menu and I'm we're happy. 

Doesn't disappoint, so why not try it yourself. I could easily have this once a week. The servers are really nice, the food is even better."}
{"text":"Yummy everything is yummy got tue lunch special mamma lee chow mein! The soup and egg rolls were good as well.Excellent service"}
{"text":"Really really impressed with the Hainanese Chicken (only served on the weekend) the only other place I knew in Vegas that had it was downtown - which is too far, and it closed because of rodents, yikes! Super clean in here and this place is less that .5 miles from my house. Pork belly buns were on point, too. Will be back for the Laksa! I'll keep updating but I'm sure everything will be delicious, I have a good feeling about this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! This was our go-to lunch spot while staying in Vegas for 3 months. My usually was green garden bowl & spicy noodles or spicy fried rice. Portions were great (usually enough left over for dinner or lunch the next day) I recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"I was pretty bummed when Jumping Rice and Rolls closed down and was looking for a new local, casual dining Asian spot. This place was great! My server was very kind and checked up with us frequently with water refills. 

I got the spicy fried rice and dancing tofu. The dancing tofu was light and was complimented by the sweet peanut sauce. My spicy fried rice was also good. I'd say it wasn't very spicy, but better not too spicy than too spicy, right? The food was priced very reasonably."}
{"text":"LAKSA. LAKSA. LAKSA!

I was so excited to find a restaurant in Vegas that serves Laksa! I ate Laksa a lot when I was growing up in Sydney, and I was bummed that it wasn't available in Vegas... until now!

Their Laksa was DELISH! It's very creamy (coconut milk), had enough meat (chicken & egg), portion size was generous, and it's only $6.99!

The owners came to our table to check on us since my friend couldn't handle the spice of the Laksa. So, they gave us a bowl of coconut milk to add & it was perfect.

The owners were genuinely nice & welcoming. They're from Singapore, so you know the food & taste are authentic.

I also tried their Pork Belly Bun (2 appetizer pieces for $3.99), and that was delicious. 

I can't wait to go back & try their others dishes, and of course, eat their Laksa again =)"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Vegas.  Just opened maybe a month or 2 ago but great variety of food types from Ramen to rice...and with prices you're not gonna find anywhere else.  Everything is like $7-$9 or less even for a full bowl of ramen!?....value for food and taste is excellent!

Interior decor is nice too..modern and clean.  If you haven't eaten here you're missing out.  Plus mom and pop owners are super nice and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Awesome Pork Buns!

If I weren't afraid of my Date's judgement, I would have just ordered a 2nd or even 3rd serving of the Pork Buns.  The pork was meaty but not too fatty, and the Bao was warm and soft.  To follow up, I ordered some Ramen which was the perfect choice for one of the rainy nights we had not too long ago. 

The plaza had plenty of parking for this and other businesses, and the sign was lit and plenty visible.  

The atmosphere was a bit quiet and not very lively.  There was a TV above the register that was playing a YouTube playlist of popular songs, which was very nice."}
{"text":"We had the shoyu ramen and sweet and spicy noodles. Both were very good, I'll definitely be back to try some of the smaller dishes. For dessert we had the boba cha cha which was boba, taro and sweet potato in a bowl of warm coconut milk, so good! Service was great, very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"We got the shrimp chow mein and the fish ball noodle soup and the broccoli. Everything was delicious and the prices were very reasonable. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall with good food. We came here for a quick bite and got a variety of small bites. They were all delicious especially the braised pork belly buns. The ramen dishes looked tasty and I really wanted the try the Laksa. Maybe next time. 
I had a fried rice dish with an egg easy over which was great. This is good comfort food which makes this place a convenient stop for us."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place for the first time with my friend for a quick lunch. We ordered a ramen soup and a bowl of noodle with beef.  The taste was excellent and service was pleasant. I just found this place and it has only been open since December 2017. It is very close by and would love to become a regular to this place.  Lunch special for $8.99 sounds pretty good.  Try this place for reasonable price but superb food taste!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is fairly new. Its kinda small maybe 8 tables inside. It appread to be very clean which is nice.

Service is a bit slow but i didnt mind as it appeared each dish was made to order and every dish came out very hot.

Nothing was bad but nothing was great either. We got the pork belly buns. The buns where nice and fluffy but kinda small portion of pork belly but it tasted fine.

Next was the pan fried dumplings again came out hot and tasted decent but nothing wowing.

The last app was the chicken wings. They where fried nicely but they just poured the thai style sweet/spicey sauce on them and put more sauce on the side. Again nothing great.

The main dish was called sweet & juicy chicken.  That is trying to be fancy i guess as it was just sesame chicken.  Again nothing amazing but it did come out hot.

If ur in the area and want Chinese food that is fresh and hot give it a try but dont expect to be wow'd by the flavor profiles."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a couple of weeks ago & the food was amazing! Im originally from Singapore and there was some food on their menu that were inspired from malaysia/singapore so that was pretty cool and not to mentioned the owner of the restaurant is from Malaysia and shes super super nice! The prices of the food is also pretty reasonable which is also good!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  Braised pork buns, pork chow mein, rice bowls at an unbelievable price.  If I lived in Vegas, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. It was such great value! You can try out little dishes so you get more variety. Good flavors and great service! They noticed I didn't really eat much of my chicken (only cuz I like white meat) but wasn't expecting her to be so nice and she took it off the bill. Wow! A lil goes a long way. Will be back. Thank you guys for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Very nice space with a lot to choose from. The appetizers came out fast and delicious, and the sauces were great. Those pork buns are amazing (order 2). The Sweet & Juicy chicken is my new favorite food! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This was such a great find! The food is incredible, and the staff are very friendly. It is a super comfortable environment, a lovely family oriented restaurant. I was blown away by all of the food that I had. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The prices are also unbeatable. Make this your next stop for Chinese food. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious!??! Yes!!! Place just opened up three months ago and now is going to be our new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Bland and pretty much mediocre. 
I was very surprised that this was such a bland experience since the ratings were so high. The restaurant was uncomfortably warm. I got to the point that I couldn't wait to leave. It was clean but very small. 
Now remember I love in spring valley and Asian cuisine is my love! So you really do have to be competitive in this side of town. The food was priced right but flavor fell short. They don't have a drink menu. 
We ordered the lunch specials curry pork and sweet and spicy rice. The lunch specials come with egg drop soup, spring rolls and either a canned soda or bottled water. We also ordered the pan fried dumplings. 
The sweet and spicy rice was neither of those things. It was good but just fried rice with a fried egg on top. The curry was mediocre and I wouldn't recommend it. (Curry being my favorite thing in the planet!) The spring rolls and egg drop soup were both yummy. The pan fried dumplings were okay. 
Over all this place is a miss. I wouldn't recommend it. It just doesn't hold up there's too many delicious and above and beyond in spring valley to ever visit this place."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time. The food was delicious. Everything was cooked perfectly and oh so tasty. The owners were so sweet and even offered us a free bowl of noodles. The only bad thing was that I stuffed myself on the all of the appetizers, that I could not finish my noodles. I highly recommend this place and will definitely come back soon. When there, make sure you order the chicken wings and calamari. The Laksa noodle was also good. Everything we ordered tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Sweet & Spicy is a new, casual restaurant located off Durango and Flamingo.  Sweet & Spicy is a family owned business ran by Momma Lee and her husband.  The menu consists of apps, noodles, rice bowls, chicken, ramen, and desserts. Everything on the menu is inexpensive (nothing over $7.99) and the portions are large enough to be shared.  In fact, the owner even stated that they wanted to keep the dishes big enough so that everyone in their group can enjoy.   Overall service was excellent. 

We shared the Chinese Broccoli, Braised Pork Belly Buns, Sweet & Spicy Chicken, Sweet & Juicy Chicken, Shaking Chicken, bowl of Laksa, Mango & Sticky Rice, and Rice Pudding.  I enjoyed everything that I tried.  I recommend the Chinese Broccoli, Shaking Chicken, Sweet & Spicy Chicken, Pork Belly Buns, and the sticky rice.  Our entire bill was around $30.  I also look forward to trying their ramen, signature rice bowl, and the Bobo Chacha dessert (taro, sweet potato, rich coconut mix, and boba).  Again, price for everything is inexpensive, portions are big, and the food is good.  

TIP:  $8.99 Lunch Combo (11:00 AM to 5:00 PM) includes an entrée, egg drop soup or spring roll, and a drink.  Great deal!!"}
{"text":"The staff is friend but honestly, this is by far the worst Chinese food I've had in awhile. All of the items we ordered:
-shoyu ramen
-calamari
-lychee massaman curry
-braised pork belly bun
-grass jelly lychee
-mango pudding

The ramen had absolutely no taste to it. It was really watered down. No flavor whatsoever. The pork in the ramen tasted weird too. It was very thick and a little rough to eat. The calamari was just okay. It was very small and not really worth it. Didn't have a lot of flavor either. Lychee massaman curry was bland. Also no flavor. Braised pork bun was decent but the buns were overly soggy and they didnt put enough of sauce in the bun. The grass jelly is by far the worst ive ever had. You can buy can grass jelly from an asian market and make it home and it would taste better than the one here. Last item we ordered was the mango pudding and that was also lacking in flavor. Overall, this place is just the most blandest chinese food ive ever had and i don't recommend it. Go somewhere in China Town if you want decent asian food."}
{"text":"I was in a mood for Chinese  food the day and tried out this place! I must say it was delicious! I tried quite a few different dishes and they all had their own unique taste! I will most certainly go back to try out more food here again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for a wonderful lunch! Fresh ingredients, kind people running the restaurant, excellent service and perfectly flavored food. Yum, yum, and more yum. I had the sweet and spicy noodles and they couldn't have been tastier. Sweet sticky rice with mango- delectable. Vanilla ice cream even tasted better then typical vanilla. My daughter loved her udon and soup and I really super appreciated that they made it for her how she prefers it.  I also really appreciated the vegetarian options and accommodations. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Good little place for lunch or a casual dinner. Good prices and a fair value. Lunch specials are a good value. 

It's a little thing, but it's one of the few Asian places that have \"free refill fountain drinks.\" Just a nice touch, and I appreciate it. 

I had the Spicy and Sweet Noodle, and I would order it again. I did not care for the Calamari, but otherwise, I was fine with the food. She knew I was not happy with the Calamari, and provided us with a homemade dessert as her way of saying, \"thank you, and I hope you will return\".

Mama Lee recommended choices and you could not have asked for a sweeter, or kinder hostess. She took an interest in everyone's satisfaction with their meals, and that is the mark of courtesy and good management.

This is one of those places that you wish the owners the best of success, and you hope they will succeed."}
{"text":"Singaporean asian fusion. Casual, but not that take out chinese kind of casual. It's a cute, easy spot for dinner with fast service. 
Laksa Noodles: coconut curry based noodles. Tasted like watered down yellow curry. The description says rich, but it had a very watery texture. 
Dan dan noodles: sichuan chinese noodles. Minced pork, spicy sauce is on the side. It has enough taste on its own, so if you're afraid of the spicy you can still have it. 
Shaking chicken: deep fried chicken poppers? Easy appetizer to share."}
{"text":"Found this one thanks to a friend that told me about this. Checked the place out and it was quite a nice indeed as I'm told. The customer service here was great. But what made the experience here great was the food that they serve. Truly delicious and tasty. Nice presentation and the taste quality was superb. Have yet to decide when we would be back but we will."}
{"text":"I've been looking for good udon noodles noodles in Vegas- I'm happy to say my search is over. If you love Udon like i do- i challenge you- i ask you to give Sweet and Spicy a try. I'm not a huge fan of pork- and i asked if i could substitute beef- the chefs made a meal that was way beyond what i was expecting. Oh and PS the price point is perfect. So if you're on the west side- or does not mind the jump across the city i would give this place a spin!"}
{"text":"Found out about this new little place from Terri R. and Mel C., and I'm so glad we followed their suggestion. It's a gem!

We were greeted so warmly, first by our waiter, Chris, then Mama Lee, the owner, and then finally by her husband, Patrick, who was helping out on his day off. What wasn't so warm was the temperature - we were freezing (the thermostat said 66°), but they cheerfully raised it, plus offered us complimentary hot jasmine tea to warm us up, which Mama Lee refilled constantly.

The menu isn't ordinary Chinese but, since Mama is from Singapore, the food reflects the eclectic nature of that country's cuisine: there's something for everyone.

There's a small cup of fresh edamame on the table to snack on while you're looking at the menu.  We started with an appetizer of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. Since I had told Patrick that I like to try to \"eat healthy,\" he thoughtfully left off the oil and served the sauce on the side, which I appreciated.

We ordered Singapore noodles and Shoyu ramen to share. The ramen broth was very tasty, and the Singapore noodles were chock full of shrimp, chicken, and egg. Not as spicy as some I've had, but there's stuff on the table to add as much fire as you like. It was fine for me. Next time I'll probably try some of the Thai options.

What made this place our new go-to for Asian food was not just the quality of food, the cleanliness, the modern decor, and the low, low prices - it was the unbelievable friendliness of Mama, Patrick, and Chris, who kept checking on us and exuding a warmth unlike any other place of this kind. Maybe not every diner appreciates it when an owner sits down at the next table to have a chat, but for us it makes us feel like valued guests. I wish more owners would recognize that genuine friendliness goes a long way to creating loyal customers. 

You can do take-out, of course, but for Mama Lee and Patrick, they'd rather you sit down and stay a while. That what \"people\" people do!"}
{"text":"We found this place because we had to take our computer for repair next door . The worker suggested that if we wanted great southeastern Asian food to try the place next door . Glad we did ! Everything was very good and very reasonable priced . Love the pork-belly bun and both of the Curry dishes with just the right amount of heat ! Owner very friendly and chatty ! Over all a great new place in the valley ! We will be back !! If I could give 6 stars I would !!"}
{"text":"must try the laksa noodle soup! It' DA BOMB.COM!!! Very nice people and the food is great!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place been.  I loved it so much last week that I came again and brought the rest of the family!  I don't even know where to begin but everything is yummy, the owners and staff are friendly, and they love to talk about their food and the restaurant.  The prices are reasonable for such good sized portions. The best thing is the food the flavor is just incredible. I have tried the laksa noodles, fried fish soup, Singapore noodles, lychee curry, pork belly udon, calamari, dumplings, and the pork belly buns. Everything is delicious but the laksa noodles are my favorite. The pork belly is just as good if not better than I have had at five star restaurants. Even though I know this place is going to get popular and that means harder to get into, I am sure this will be a very successful business."}
{"text":"We just got into town and were starving when my friend mentioned he saw great reviews of this place and after tonight I would have to say I agree with all those reviews. This place was absolutely amazing! The atmosphere and owners are both friendly and fun and made sure we had a great experience the entire time! The food was incredible and we will definitely be back before we leave."}
{"text":"Wow, we continue to be impressed everytime we come here.

The food is fresh and you can taste the quality ingredients.

The prices are fair, especially given the nice ambiance of the restaurant.

The owners are a lovely couple and are actively involved in the daily operations and menu creation. The husband is also an executive chef for a big restaurant on the strip.

Overall, high end Las Vegas Strip quality food, without the high prices!"}
{"text":"If you like noodles this is the place. Great taste with great prices. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"LOCATION: 
Easy access and has lots of parking space which is a plus! 

AMBIENCE:
Max. of 39 person. Noise is acceptable. I really enjoyed dining here :)

CLEANLINESS:
Very clean and welcoming place!

SERVICE:
Top notch!  Very friendly and appreciative :) Food is in our table in a timely manner!

PRICE:
Very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Portions and prices are very reasonable. The laksa was tasty but there were a lot of hard stems from the basil and something else so I had to remove them from my mouth. That made enjoying my food a little harder. They were out of shrimp so we couldn't get the shrimp udon. The miso ramen had a very strong wine taste and wasn't like any of the dozen ramen places we've been to. The pork was super thinly sliced and not very good either. I think it was because the broth was so weird tasting. The Chinese broccoli was really tasty as a side dish. It was fresh and the gravy was nicely flavored. The pork buns were good, but not the best. The pork was thin and underwhelming. I could see one of the cooks in the kitchen doing something that looked like smelling how fresh some of the ingredients were before using it. That kind of worried me. When he saw me looking, he moved so I couldn't see him. The tables were not super clean and though they were not at all busy, they left tables dirty with dishes for quite some time after people left. I want to come back to try some of their small plates but I'm not sure the wide range of Asian dishes is doing them any favors because they don't specialize and make the specialty shine.
The YouTube videos of singing they play are terrible. It's the most annoying thing in the restaurant."}
{"text":"You will find freshly made and tasty Asian food here. Great and friendly service from everyone especially from Chevy.  I am looking forward to them expanding their menu for more Singaporean food.  This place is a \"must try\"."}
{"text":"This place was also a recommendation from Mel C and Terri R. It's nice to have friends in places you visit so you can eat what locals eat. Sweet & Spicy is a new restaurant in Vegas so we came to check them out. Mel and Terri raved about the portions and price so we put them to the test of cheap eats. You definitely get a lot for your money here. Thanks for the recommendation Mel and Terri!

Sweet & Spicy is located next to CareNow Urgent Care. There are lots of parking in the strip mall it resides in. Mama Lee greeted and served us. She is really friendly and provided us great customer service. They are the only place in Vegas with laksa according to Mama Lee. She's been here 13 years from Singapore so she knows a thing or two about laksa. 

The kitchen accommodated our request for half pan fried potstickers and half fried potstickers when we ordered their Homemade Little Dumplings. We also ordered the Braised Pork Belly Buns, Poached Broccoli, Sweet & Spicy Wings and Crispy Egg Noodle. They were all good but my favorite was the Braised Pork Belly Buns. It's a must order here. If you're in the mood for cheap eats or laksa then come check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is one of best restaurant in town.
I am so glad Sweet & Spaicy just opened.
Everyone who visit here have to try Laksa & Dang Dang Noodle.
It was So Awesome even though I just tried it as first time.
The owner told me that Laksa noodle is from Singapore.
It is kind of curry based soup that was so good taste!
Dang Dang noodle is seseame based sauce and noodle is made of white egg-- all food is very Authentic !
I ordered also some Calamari & Spicy wing those were so crunchy.
They served with home made spicy sauce.
I am dying to have other dishes for the next visit.
Yes, Absolutely I will visit Very Often!"}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP THIS PLACE IS AMAZINGGG!!! Seriously you HAVE to go here during lunch. Lunch special is from open until I believe 5pm which is just ridiculous and awesome!! I have been here twice in 3 days for lunch because you cannot beat DELICIOUS AND CHEAP FOOD. For $10 WITH TAX you can get one of their lunch specials which is an entree, soup, TWO egg rolls, and a drink! That is an insane deal and for real their food is super yummy. Do yourself a favor and go here for lunch! They replaced this other Asian restaurant and thank god that they did because I work less than a 5 minute walk away and will be hitting them up every other day!!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood family style restaurant. Clean, good service and delicious Asian cuisine. Recommended by friend a few weeks ago and we fell in love with this place ever since and we are here almost every week. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Simple but so amazing. Sweet & Spicy is a hidden gem. They opened like a month ago. I have been here a couple times now and have tried many of their dishes. I ordered the Sweet & Spicy Wings and the Laksa Noodle. The Laksa Noodle is a must have! It's a dish from Singapore (foodie heaven) and the Laksa here brings me back. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Awesome option if you live in this neighborhood and want a quick fix for Asian food. This place has a variety of dishes from dumplings and ramen, to crispy noodles and fried rice. Our server was polite and told us about the specials. We decided to get the pork buns, fried dumplings, shoyu ramen, and sweet and spicy fried rice. Everything we ordered was tasty and pricing was great for the amount of food we ordered."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and I am super impressed with the food quality and service. Everything on the menu is super fresh and yummy; my favorite is the pork belly bun. Highly recommended if you are looking for a good value Chinese Singaporean fusion place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious satay - chicken flavorful, sauce equally nice, so good we order two. Crispy noodle with chicken and gravy, legit and tasty.  Pan fried dumplings - they are ok, skin too thick for us. 
Dining area is spacious, new and clean. Servers very attentive. First impression looks promising, may become our new regular place"}
{"text":"Wow. They were super friendly and the food is delicious. We were able to try 6 menu items for under $30 and were greeted with complimentary Jasmine tea. This is like an oriental fusion TAPAS style food restaurant. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time and it was really good. 
* Very clean and friendly environment.
* Many food opinions.
* Fresh food. 
* Authentic asian flavor. 

I ordered the regular fried rice with chicken and it was delicious, I actually did want to stop eating it. I am a rice fanatic and it's hard to find rice like this so I Highly Recommend it. 

My friend ordered the beef chow mein that was also very good. 

If your in the area and looking for some good food definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Saw this cute little spot driving by and decided to check it out. They have $8.99 lunch specials that come with egg drop soup and two egg rolls. I ordered the lunch sweet and spicy fried rice and really liked that it wasn't too spicy and had a nice garlic flavor. My mom ordered the mama lee fried rice with shrimp which was not spicy and she loved it. She said she's never seen so much shrimp in a lunch special. Really great size too. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"it's a pretty alright place to have lunch, nothing super amazing! But their pork buns were very good! And service was on point!"}
{"text":"Not many Singaporean food choices in Vegas but Sweet and Spicy does it right. Try their Laksa if you haven't already. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the staff is amazing, drinks filled, very respectful. The place is very clean and roomy. The food on the other hand is out of this world. The ramen is amazing, the pork buns are amazing. The dumplings are amazing. If you want a white glove 5 Star experience give this place a try. I will be recommending all my friends, family and coworkers to this place. Please give this place a try you will not be disappointed. If I can add more stars I would, but it only lets me add 5. Thank you sweet and spicy for this great experience and service."}
{"text":"What a delicious place! Everything was amazing! We ordered for six people and left spending $55 tip included! The food was perfectly seasoned, not drenched in oil and cooked to perfection! The place was super clean, the staff so friendly and the food was utter perfection! Definitely a favorite! I will be back weekly!!"}
{"text":"bomb ass food. this place is dank as fuck. i always the laksa cuz thT shit is *TRIPLE FIRE EMOJI* as fuck. The price is insanely good too. any place with good ass food and good ass price will get the 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Wow! Their food is delicious! Soup was not too salty. Customer service was excellent. For sure we will be back again. Everything was really good. So glad we decided to give this place a try. 
It was my mom birthday and the owner was so so nice and got my mom a piece of sticky rice with mango and ice cream. What a nice surprise! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I do not write reviews often enough if at all. My wife gives me a hard time because she says I use Yelp to my advantage but never contribute. I felt compelled to write a review for Sweet and Spicy because this place is outstanding. As other reviews have stated, it was opened by an executive chef from the strip and his wife. What they created is something special. You get the experience and knowledge of running a restaurant from the chef, but you also get the food he and his wife are passionate to create. This food will not only bring you to Singapore and Malaysia, but into the community, into a home there. This is a true mom and pop place in every sense, except it is an Asian mom and pop place in your backyard. I call myself a \"foodie\" because I love what food can teach me about a culture and the Mama Lee Kitchen Sweet and Spicy you will learn a lot. 

I know I never mentioned what we actually ate, but it is inconsequential since I am positive everything on the menu is great and made with love. 

Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Modern decor. Excellent food and a great value! 

We each had the lunch special: egg drop soup, spring rolls,  sweet and spicy noodles with chicken.  Food was so good and generous, had enough for two more take home meals.  Total bill for two with drinks was under $20. Worth the drive from Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Love their food!  So good and Mama Lee (the owner) actually served us. She was so sweet and hospitable! She gave us a free mango pudding that was amazing and they have refillable Thai Iced Tea which was great too.  The food here reminded me of a sampling of all the amazing foods you can find in one of the gigantic food halls in Singapore.   Support this amazing local find!  Definitely coming back!  Thanks Mama Lee!"}
{"text":"Wow, this hot and new business has tasty food that won't break the bank! Nothing on the menu is priced more than $7.99. Run by the executive chef of an Asian restaurant on the Strip and his wife, this family business offers up menu items that are perfect for sharing. 
Three of us came here for dinner last night and the service and food were great. I especially liked the Chinese Broccoli with garlic oyster sauce ($2.99!), Braised Pork Belly Buns (2 for $3.99!), Sweet and Juicy Chicken ($7.99!), and Sticky Rice and Mango ($3.99 for a cup) . Seriously, the prices are so cheap and the food so good! There were even leftovers for Debbie N. because her bowl of Laksa ($7.99!) was so big! We will definitely come back for more- I want to taste the ramen next time!
Open 7 days a week from 11am-10pm: check them out."}
{"text":"When I went it was the Sunday of presidents weekend...I was excited that it had such high ratings...what the heck?!?! What am I missing? First off....the credit card and debit machine wasn't working....cash only. I ordered the chicken teriyaki type bowl and a spicy bowl and then a pork bun taco looking thing to go....none of it had any flavor. They relied on the sauce for flavor and the sauce wasn't even good. We took a bite or two and we hated it. We tossed it and went out to eat. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I know, I know- another 5 star review. I promise the 5 stars mean something from me! 

Ambience: cool, casual, relaxed, and not pretentious. I love environments like this. You can come with friends or bring your family. 

Alcohol: none- I don't think. 

Food: Singaporean fusion food. I recommend coming with 3 of your good friends and ordering a few dishes. I've been here several times and I can HIGHLY recommend the chicken satay, wings, broccoli, Mongolian beef, and any of the soups. I was not the biggest fan of the miso, but I just couldn't ding them for it. They still deserve five stars. 

Pricing: unbelievably cheap. You cannot go wrong. 

Visit this place of a tasty experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this more. There service was adequate, maybe even good. The food was tasty and a little lacking in sophistication, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Affordable and tasty dishes, and super nice owners.  One of my go-tos when I need a quick meal."}
