{"text":"Stopped in to install some small parts on equipment nearby and had to try this place out. Was so good I redownloaded yelp to give this place a great shout out. Alex was the chef and the fabulous philly steak and cheese came out I will remember forever. Infact we will revisit this place soon. Well done, good food good service."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for lunch and was happily NOT disappointed. I just moved here from CA and have been searching for a good Philly sandwich and after trying a few others, this one hit the spot. Today I am back to take some home for dinner and had a confusing order. The cook listened and made the to go order just as asked. For that alone I give this place 5 stars, it's hard to find such great service now a days. So customer service and delicious food, they've got me hooked! O yea, everything is cooked to order, fresh goodness on a delicious roll!"}
{"text":"We had been waiting months for this place to open. When it finally did we stopped in. Now my wife is GREEK/TURKISH so she knows gyro/doner. We knew it was probably going to  be middle eastern and not Greek or Turkish but we wanted to check it out anyway.  I placed an order for the gyro and a gyro plate.  We were expecting gyro meet sliced from a typical cone of gyro meat. What we got was randomly cut up chunks of meat that felt like it had been thawed in a microwave and then placed in front of the heating element. It didn't even look like the rotisserie was  turning. Pieces of the meat were cold and I don't think it was the TON of cucumber yogurt sauce it was drowning in. It also suffered from a ridiculous amount of onion. Now I expect a healthy amount of onion on a gyro but I may as well have had a half an onion on the side to bite into. The lady taking my order was extremely nice and that's why this place is getting 1 star but the guys in the kitchen let her down because it took a long time to get our food. They have the potential to be good because the flavor is there but they need to fix some issues."}
{"text":"Finally a place that makes delicious Philly cheese steaks! Be prepared to receive HOT. Seasoned fries, not sure if they will make them plain? #1 gets your sandwich, fries & drink for $9.99. Yes you may have to wait a little while for your food but it's worth it. I come here to eat a good meal for a decent price. You will leave full & satisfied."}
{"text":"We both had Philly steak sandwich and fries.  Philly steak sandwich was near perfect.  Bread soft, chewy, little crunch.  Meat, cheese piping hot.  Little messy but meat was very tender and no fatty gross bites you sometimes find.   And meat was not chewy.  Sandwich was great.  Fries are steak fries which I prefer but these were a little over-well done.  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars.  $9.99 gets you sandwich, fries, and a drink. Which is followed by fullness and naptime.  Hope to be in area again and will get Philly sandwich whether in the mood or not.  Good job guys.  Thank you.."}
{"text":"First time in and it was amazing! The own told us he had only been open for a month or so and explained the menu to us. The Philly Cheesesteak was big and fresh. My favorite was the fries w/ season salt... yummm."}
{"text":"Omg slowest service ever!  And it's not even busy.  3 employees working and all we ordered was a simple cheeseburger.  Been waiting 25 minutes.  We won't be back !!  The burger tasted like a gyro, wow.  Not good but we ate because we were starving...boo"}
{"text":"So good! This is my 3rd time here. I have had the Philly Cheesesteak, the gyro, and the Greek salad. My husband has had the burger multiple times and loves it. Yes, you may have to wait a bit but they are making your food to order. The food is fresh and they are definitely not chintzy on the portion size. Please don't let the fact that it is in a strip mall in Glendale deter you from coming here. It is very good food and highly recommended."}
{"text":"At a chicken gyro and it was delicous!! The fries are not as good as their gyros. Pretty decent for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Closed early...won't try again...at least 20 min early drove over should have called enroute."}
{"text":"As soon as I stepped in, the air was hot and thick with the scent of garlic and onion and all the other good stuff. I knew this wasn't gonna be some crap pulled out of a box and slapped onto the grill. Their meals take EFFORT.   The fries are perfectly seasoned. The cheesesteak is absolutely bomb and won't leave you disappointed. They don't skimp--it's literally spilling over with toppings. You're damn right if you think you'll feel guilty after this meal. Not because of the obvious caloric intake but because I don't know what you or I have done correctly in life to enjoy something that tastes this good. It's the best!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to get a good tasting cheese steak, I sent my son to pick me up a Chicken Philly. It was ok, Im a Jersey girl and I have had my fair share from cheesesteaks, this was ok at best.  I will at some point try the original cheesesteaks and see if there is an inprovement."}
{"text":"First time to this place I was nervous as on  what area it is bud I tell u best Philly steak I ever had it's worth the money and a try will definitely come again"}
{"text":"The fries here are the bomb. I had a cheesesteak and it was good. Hole in the wall place for sure and yes the service is very, very slow. Part of it is everything is cooked to order the other part, I do not know. Maybe they need more help."}
