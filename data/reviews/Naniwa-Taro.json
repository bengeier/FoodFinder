{"text":"They have such an extensive menu!! Love it!! I wanted to try both the okonomiyaki and takoyaki, but I knew I couldn't finish both... But then I discovered you can order half half!! It totally made my night :) 

Everything is made fresh when you order! So I didn't mind the longer wait time. It was very delicious with awesome presentation! Very authentic! I'm definitely gonna go back to other things on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"I don't write review much but because of their hard work and yummy food, here I am. Their food doesn't look fancy and takes really long time to make (since in T&T plus I'm not such nice customer with patient, so -1 star); the store is small (now); price is just right; but, I still go there because their food tastes really delicious :) You can feel their passion once you've tried their food. Not just Okonomiyaki is a MUST TRY but also the Curry Udon is my favorite~! :) Really worth to wait for a bit longer~!"}
{"text":"We had take out here for a few times. Loved their Okonomiyaki and their Takoyaki. Last night, we actually sat down and eat in. They don't have much space for dine in. Just a bar and 2 tables. We ordered a Sukiyaki, a Hiroshimayaki and a combo 1, which is 1/2 Okonomiyaki + 1/2 Takoyaki. 

The sukiyaki is served in a personal pot and comes with rice. It was very very delicious. Their sauce is so tasty it reminded me of the one I had in Japan. For the price, you won't expect the beef to be very high grade, but it's actually not bad. And the portion was quite generous too. The Hiroshimayaki was nicely done. The portion is big, the taste is good. Again, don't think it's fair to compare it with the real thing in Hiroshima. However, this is as close as you can get here in Toronto. Will try other stuff on their menu next time. 

Service here is very friendly, typical Japanese. However, you may have a long wait for the food, both for take out and dine in. They're always busy."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place and I love that they serve pretty authentic Japanese fare. Let's face it, it's hard to find any non-sushi japanese restaurants in Toronto, especially ones that are not located in the downtown core area, so suffice to say when I saw this place I was thrilled! I finally had the opportunity to try all these dishes that I've read or heard about. I know that not everything on this menu is amazing, but I love how nice the owners are, and every time I go there I always feel great giving them my business. Plus I love their oknomiyaki, and whenever I'm in the area I definitely stop by to grab that. The yaki udon is also great, even though its such a simple dish. This little booth is just amazing and I honestly have no problem waiting just a short period of time for some pretty delicious cheap eats!"}
{"text":"I have eaten lots of takoyaki in Japan and Naniwa Taro's takoyaki is the best takoyaki I've had in Toronto! I come here at least once a week to eat it. I love the green onion takoyaki. I also like the chicken katsu, croquettes and hot pot udon. My fianc√© loves the pork teriyaki and chicken steak. I find the prices at Naniwa Taro are cheaper than other restaurants in the area. Two people can easily dine here for less than $30. 

A variety of drinks are available, including pop, iced tea and small juice boxes. There is also a machine that you can use to pour yourself cold or hot water (for free). 

The restaurant is run by a Japanese couple. Since there are only two of them, it may take a long time to get your order, especially at busy times. The food is definitely worth the wait though!! Good food takes time to make! 

The restaurant is quite small, with a counter that seats four people and two tables which seat two people each, which makes it more suitable for solo diners or small groups (2-3 people) rather than large groups. This is why I notice a lot of people ordering take-out. 

Overall, Naniwa Taro is a great place to eat authentic Japanese food like takoyaki and okonomiyaki!"}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure.

Need to wait a bit for food. (Avg. 15 mins wait) 
I ate a sukiyaki set. The soup is a bit too sweet to my taste, but very tasty and filling. 

The price is fair, the place is a bit cramp and hot."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday afternoon around 2pm. We saw a lady on her phone behind the curtain leading into the kitchen in the back while we looked at the menu. We then rang the bell and she came out promptly to take our order.

We had originally wanted to order a katsu curry and fried shrimp curry plus the C1 combo which came with half okonomiyaki and 4 takoyaki. However it turns out that they had enough curry for either the katsu or fried shrimp curry so I changed my katsu curry order to an order of yakisoba. Another girl who arrived after us was told that they had no curry left and it would take 2 hours to prepare a new batch of curry.

Here's where it got a little strange. I've been reading that this place is run by an elderly Japanese couple. There's 3 flags that I caught when we were there:

1) Before we arrived, There was a group of 4 people that were seated at the table. As they left, one of them said \"gochisosama deshita\" which basically means \"thank you for the meal\". There was no reaction from the lady.

2) When we went to order, I referred to the fried shrimp curry as \"ebi furai\" (ebi=shrimp, furai=fry) curry. The lady gave me a puzzled look so I had to repeat it using the English name for the dish.

3) Last one's the nail in the coffin. While we were waiting for our food, a man came in with 2 bags of stuff from H-mart and went straight into the kitchen. We then immediately heard some Cantonese being spoken. 

Either the owners hired other people to run the place on certain days or they sold the business. Or the owners know some Cantonese though I find that highly unlikely. It just seems odd that my observations seem contrary to what others have posted.

The takoyaki and okonomiyaki were starchy and mushy. The fried shrimp curry looked and tasted rather pathetic but the yakisoba was alright. The food came out relatively quickly.

Overall, I've had better. The food is not nearly as \"authentic\" as everyone describes it to be, compared to what we've had at other places actually run by Japanese people."}
{"text":"This place is amazing of you want really good, home-made Japanese food. I've tried Takoyaki and Okonomiyaki in different places before and they've always seemed like cheap knock-offs of the real thing - bland on flavor and looks. I loved the Takoyaki here - it looks, smells and tastes amazing. The place is tiny, seats 10 people max (with no elbow room whatsoever) so I always do takeout. If you know what you want and hate waiting, call ahead to order. The food is always made fresh so it takes a while before it's ready. I found the price a tad expensive (only 6 Takoyaki for $5.48 and omurice for $7.98) but the quality makes it so worth it. All in all, not a place I would go to get food when I'm really hungry, but perfect for satisfying that craving for real Japanese flavors!"}
{"text":"Def a hidden gem in north york! I had their Hiroshimayaki and it was delicious! It's kinda like the yabisoba except its placed on top of a okonomiyaki crepe with the vegetables. However the food was a little slow. Prob had to wait about 15-20 mins. The place is very small as well, only 2 small tables and a small bar so I would not recommend coming here with a large group of people. It is more of a takeout place."}
{"text":"value and tasety? good place for lunch? really love this place k2 is delicious?if u want high value and cheap price for meal ?that is the best place for u?"}
{"text":"checked this place out for the first time with a friend last night...the food is very fresh and as far as I can tell it seems authentic. my friend and I remembered to say \"itadakimasu!\" before eating :) it's a tiny place but the owners are really friendly. they're usually in the back but there's a little bell you can ring for assistance. their takoyaki is made fresh and definitely worth the wait :) perfect on a cold night! I ate them there while they were hot and I'd definitely recommend eating them right away...oishii! the onigiri I wasn't crazy about since it just tasted like white rice with a bit of seasoning. but I'll definitely be back for takoyaki! looks like they offer sukiyaki as well which I've been dying to try ever since my friend from Japan described it to me :)"}
{"text":"update: they didn't give me my 2 pops and said they are coming back. But it's been 30 minutes. There's no driver! !      Do not order delivery! You will regret, cry, and starve. First of all, she's not gonna understand you over the phone. Secondly, they don't even deliver to your door. And. It takes them two hours to deliver! Or even longer, if they have customers in store. I don't get it. Hire a driver if you're in the delivery business."}
{"text":"Grabbed an afternoon snack on my way home, and based on great reviews from Yelp, I got the C1 combo + one croquette (heard about it so much on Japanese anime). The food was nice, but nothing memorable. The croquette was cute but forgettable. I didn't like the taste or texture of okonomiyaki, and the takoyaki was just meh. I swear the takoyaki at that OCAD place is at least ten times better!! But oh well, I live in North York:/ The lady at the counter was not welcoming either, I feel entirely betrayed by Yelp reviews:("}
{"text":"It's a small place on Bying&yonge street, so I usually get take-out. Takoyaki is my go to item, comes with 6 pieces. Pretty good with a fair price. By the way, you can park on the street."}
{"text":"This is the place to get fresh takoyaki, okonomyaki and Japanese curry in North York! 

That said, you'll need to have the patience to wait over 20 minutes for your food. The long wait time is a real bummer, but you can call ahead for pick up. 

When I picked up my order and got home, the takoyaki was unfortunately soggy already so I may need to eat it right at the store next time. 

Service is friendly and everything is decently priced. It's a small store right by VIPS Sushi, don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Have seen many good reviews about this restaurant and went there to give it a try. The place is small and the order did take time to cook. I ordered a Hiroshima Okonomiyaki and an Omurai yakisoba take out.

Hiroshima Okonomiyaki (score:4/5)
Unlike the traditional Japanese okonomiyaki, there's no batter at the base. I like how they cook it without the batter, less carbohydrates and less filling and gave me more room to try other food. Other than the batter, there's soba, cabbage, shrimps, pickle ginger, aonori and green onion as the ingredients. The taste is not too strong and I like it.

Omurai yakisoba (score 5/5)
It's basically fried noodles with chicken with a thin slice of egg with mayonnaise and ketchup on top of the noodles. Although the dish look simple, it tastes good. I believe the mayonnaise and the ketchup made the dish alive. Can't stop from digging in it though feeling full!! 

I will definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"We ordered takoyaki and yakisoba. The takoyaki was perfect and the yakisoba came in a much larger portion than anticipated. Food was quick and they have a few tables for people to tray and eat, but it looks like it is a popular take out location. Offers a great variety of japanese fast food."}
{"text":"Found this quaint little Japanese eatery run by an adorable couple. There is limited seating and can get very cramped when busy. Their menu is plastered along the walls with helpful pictures to entice your visual senses. I ordered their takoyaki and sukiyaki. Takoyaki is a round squid ball, fried on the outside with a soft, creamy squid filled inside. It's drizzled with Japanese mayo and topped with Bonito flakes--nice tasty starter. The sukiyaki arrives in a cute personal size ceramic clay pot and a bowl of rice. The beef is tender, vegetables/tofu not overly done & the raw egg adds a nice creaminess when stirred into to the sukiyaki broth. On a cold winter day this meal warmed my body/soul and satisfied my appetite completely. Thank you Naniwa I will definitely be back for your okonomiyaki."}
{"text":"Pros:  
Some of the best Katsu and Okonomiyaki I've had in the city
Lots of choices
Very reasonably priced

Cons:
Somewhat unclear on when it actually opens.  Sometimes it's at 12, sometimes it's at 1:30
Small space, only about 8 seats in total

I'll echo what other reviewers are saying in that it's a fairly authentic, and tasty place to get Japanese food.  The katsu curry is amazing, and the okonomiyaki variations are very good.  The takoyaki is very flavourful, although beware that it gets soggy very quickly inside the takeout box if you don't eat in."}
{"text":"I have only ever tried they're takoyaki so I am biased. I love eating takoyaki so I am very picky with it. This is by far my very very favorite place for takoyaki. They make it fresh out of the batter.. And they're batter tastes amazing. Topped with generous amounts of sauce and mayonnaise also. They also participate in Taste of Asia every year. This place is amazing for takoyaki. I have not found better.. Whether it be guu or gals. Again, my review is biased towards takoyaki, as that is the only thing I have ever ate from them. I started eating from this place about 3-4 Years ago. Quality has not changed at all and prices only went up the slightest bit... 10-20 cents maybe?"}
{"text":"My mum came into to town so we decided to hit up a near by cultural festival and saw that they put up a stand. I was super excited and got 6 pieces of takoyaki and it was by far the worst, most disgusting food I've had. It was cold and I asked for some fresher ones and the person running the stand declined (in the rudest way possible). She wouldn't even consider it and told me she would absolutely not give me fresher ones, nor give me back my money. Not only was the food quality poor, the service that I got was completely grotesque. If I could rate less than one star, I would. I do joy recommend, unless you want to get treated like garbage."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this hidden gem in North York. This a small mom and pop shop owned by a cute Japanese couple, and the food is cheap and delicious. 

I've had the yakisoba with chicken, the sukiyaki, the hiroshimayaki (which is an okononiyaki with soba noodles), and the gyudon. All were fantastic, especially the hiroshimayaki. I will most likely get the okononiyaki and takoyaki combo the next time I go there.

The food is great, the soy sauce they use is imported from Japan because the grocery stores here don't carry it, and the prices are super reasonable. 

Since it is a small whole in the wall place, the service can be quite slow since it's just the two of them running the place. I have no idea how they do delivery, but delivery is an option. Most people do pickup since seating is super limited.

Overall, absolutely love this place and can't wait to eat there again! My goal is to try everything on the menu :)"}
{"text":"After reading reviews, I had to stop by and try. I was in the area for a bit and the location was so convenient that if things worked out, Naniwa-Taro could become my go-to takeout spot! I was highly anticipating the fresh okonomiyaki and takoyaki.

The shop is super small - seating about 10 people, mostly taking takeout orders. The first time we waited around and were promised a 30-minute wait time for our food, but it ended up taking about 45 minutes. We weren't too fussed - there was a large order in front of us and the mom and pop shop didn't have any other help. We ordered the mixed okonomiyaki, curry udon, chicken yakisoba, and omurice. The okonomiyaki and curry udon were great - flavourful, the mix of pork and seafood giving good texture, the udon was chewy and the curry was fragrant and not too spicy. The chicken yakisoba wasn't bad, but didn't stand out to me. The omurice was a bit disappointing, but I think it was a matter of preference.

The next time we returned we ordered the okonomiyaki and takoyaki combo - a bit of both to cover more ground on the menu! The takoyaki was a bit overdone and the pork only okonomiyaki lacked texture - a bit distracted on the grill perhaps? We tried another udon in soup - the one with the poached egg - the udon noodles did not disappoint maintaining their chewy texture while absorbing the soup.

Overall, what stops this tiny shop from being a solid four stars is the wait time - I get it, good food takes time and sometimes best things come to those who wait, but time and time again (so \"punny\", ha) the wait for my food was longer than promised by 50-100% (read: up to twice amount the time!). If I'm looking for comfort food takeout that's super close to Yonge and Finch, it's a great spot. If I'm not in the area, a bit tough because of the wait."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this place. I think I read a review that says that they prefer Guu takoyaki to this place, but it's important to keep in mind that Guu and a few izakaya places deep fry their takoyakis instead of using the special grill thing which is the more authentic style of takoyaki. That being said, I've had my fair share of takoyakis and I believe this is my favourite. (This is also the place w/ long takoyaki line ups during the asian festivals like taste of asia. Skip the line and just come here cause they mark up the prices at the festivals)

I also really like their Katsu don, that run about $5. Ultra good deal for a ton of food that I couldn't even finish. Is it the best katsu don I've ever tasted? probably not. Is it the best tasting katsu don for $5,  YES. However despite the good price and food quality I do agree with other yelpers that wait time here is incredibly tedious. As a result, I recommend not coming here if you're in a hurry.Also T&T food court tables are quite disgusting, so maybe get it to go ;)"}
{"text":"Omg HANDSDOWN the best Japanese food in all of Toronto! They recently moved locations from Markham to North York but they are still amazing!

The best thing here is definitely the takoyaki. Pure heaven. Also my favorite thing is that they not only have okonomiyaki, which is delish, they have HIROSHIMIYAKI!!!! I've only been able to find one other restaurant that served this style and naniwa taro is definitely better. I live way far out east but I am always willing to make the drive all the way down here for that yummy hiroshimiyaki (it's that good).

Just a heads up they now take debit and do free delivery over $20 (super convenient if you live in that area)"}
{"text":"I agree with some fellow foodies here that the wait times are a little longer than usual, but it's definitely worth it. The taste is Japanese for sure. If you've ever been to Japan and tried the food, you'll see what I mean. I tried #1 and #4 and I left the place happy. 
Also,  compared to other places around the area, it's extremely affordable. $15 including tax fed two people. :)"}
{"text":"Honestly the best, most tender and juicy katsu I've had in town. It's so rare to find a place that tenderizes the meat.

Other items on the menu that I would recommend: Eel & Egg rice, Kimchi Pork Udon, Omurice.

Good prices, limited seating, food comes out slowly, but if you have the time it's definitely worth checking out this diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"This place is such a neighborhood gem. I tried it once on a random weekday evening. The restaurant is small and fits very little people but they're more of a take-out place than a real restaurant. I ordered the food in advance and they said it would take about 45 minutes. Let me tell you, it was well worth the wait. The food was delicious and felt very authentic for me especially for the price -- very affordable. There were lots of other people picking up take out from here so it's most likely a neighborhood favourite. 

The takoyaki was really good as was the katsu. I still prefer the katsu at Katsuya but for a night in, this place is probably your best bet for Japanese take out that's good for every budget. :) 

I would definitely recommend and try this place again."}
{"text":"A little gem in North York for takoyaki and okonomiyaki-lovers! Like me! It's tucked away on a side street off Yonge. The place is really small with two small tables and four \"bar\" seats. Seats max. 10 ppl. It's a really cozy mom & pop place.

I loooooove the piping hot takoyaki everytime. It's executed perfectly with all the fixings and a big piece of octopus. I've tried the okonomiyaki and some of the variations. They tend to be a little carby but who doesn't love carbs once in a while. I have yet to figure them all out. The yaki udon is great too. I can't wait to try to tonkatsu and curry they look good too. 

This place is a bit food court-esque. They give you styrofoam cups to get your own water. I wish they offered some tea. You use disposable cutlery. Seats aren't the most comfortable. Also food takes a while cause there's only two ppl working there. But these are only minor points to be able to taste the best and most affordable takoyakis!!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout this evening, their curry katsu is great! The curry is really flavourful and it's a nice portion! We also ordered the takoyaki, which is just as enjoyable. 

Thank you for a yummy and happy dinner tonight! Arigatou :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Despite its tiny size,  was a steady flow of people coming into this place. I ordered the sukiyaki (Japanese casserole with beef, tofu, and cabbage) and takoyaki (octopus balls). 

Pros: takes credit card, relatively cheap
Cons: tiny store with only seating for 6, long waiting time (approx 20-30mins), and no washrooms

There is paid parking by the street or its a quick 5 min walk south from Finch station. They have delivery for orders over $20."}
{"text":"Decent price, authentic Japanese food, fairly convenient.

The wait time is a bit long, so that's probably the only downside. The store is also occasionally closed without much notice."}
{"text":"This is a food stall inside a giant Asian supermarket.  Go there if you want to try some Japanese street food like takoyaki and different types of okonomiyaki aka \"Japanese pancake\" or \"Japanese Pizza\" (YES - they have Hiroshimayaki as well as Osaka-style).  Don't go there if you are looking for California rolls or spicy tuna rolls. 

Hiroshimayaki - I wouldn't say they are close to the best in Hiroshima, but hey, it's hard enough to find any (this is the only place in GTA that I have been to that cooks Hiroshima style okonomiyaki) and what's offered here is pretty good!  Simple toppings - pork or shrimp or squid or a mixture of all three.  When the store was first opened, the owner/chef used to automatically douse his okonomiyaki with the sauce and Japanese mayo before sprinkling on katsuobushi(bonito flake) and aonori(dried seaweed).  Now, he asks his customers if they want mayo (Hello?!  this is not the time to be health conscience, beside Japanese mayo is not Kraft).  I wonder if it's because too many customers ask him to cut the mayo.  

Takoyaki -- I think they have the best in GTA.  An order comes with 6 or 8.

You can also get osaka-style okonomiyaki or modanyaki (osaka-style plus yakisoba), a few noodles (udon and ramen) which I'd never bothered trying."}
{"text":"The place is small, mainly do takeout and deliveries.  Not sure what happened but when we went in, we waited about 10 minutes before someone showed up at the cash register to take our order.  Afterwards, she said \"it will take 20 minutes\" So we walked around the plaza and came back 20 minutes later...at that point, no one was at the store front.  I could see 2 people in the back working, or cooking I guess.  We ended up having to wait 35 minutes before we got our food.

All we ordered was an order of Okanomiyaki (Squid) and Chicken Okayodon. 2 things! They werent even that busy, there were maybe 2 other orders (1 before me and 1 after me).  No idea why they took so long.  I thought this place was supposed to be a carry and go (takeout).  Who would really wait 35 min for take out?  WIth that time, I can probably finish eating at a dine-in restaurant and be on my way home!

In terms of the food, it was your average japanese dishes, nothing extraordinary.  The Okonokiyaki was tougher than I thought, I imagined it to be much softer...but it was a little burnt and dry, which made it more work to chew.  It was saltier than expected as well.
The Okanodon was alright, but it's your typical egg + onions + chicken on rice, japanese style.  Again, nothing special.  Not sure why it's truly authentic japanese food???

Next time, if there is a next time, I will try the Takoyaki as it seems like that what they're famous for.  One positive thing though, is their prices.  For both dishes, it came up to $16.35 which is not bad for 2 people nowadays in Yonge/Finch area."}
{"text":"i like it.  simply done well food.  whther it was authentic or not.  i DNGF it was cheap.  Stick to the part of the menu there known for."}
{"text":"As the storefront suggests, this little shop definitely gives an \"authentic\" Japanese street store feel. Surprisingly though, I only found the food here to be mediocre. I enjoyed the okonomiyaki because of the crunchier texture of the cabbage, but I have a few points of criticism about the other dishes:

1) The takoyaki each had 1 very small piece of octopus inside.
2) The sukiyaki broth was extremely salty.
3) The pork katsu wasn't tender enough. 

Overall, for big eaters like me and my boyfriend, we spent a little over $15/person to each enjoy a main and also share a side. I would say it's a bit pricey for \"street food\" but I did leave with a full stomach so I can't complain. I'm not sure I would come back because I'm still on a hunt for Toronto's best takoyaki, but I wouldn't be opposed to stopping by if I were already in the area."}
{"text":"It is a small cost-effective Japanese restaurant running in North York area. The owner is a very polite Japanese lady, the service is very nice. Not a big place, only a few table in the place but feels pretty comfortable. 
They offer a variety choice of okonomitaki. Also there is a lunch menu. Like curry, udon, and other Japanese normal plates. You can whether go there for lunch or just grab some snacks. Because I am a big fan of takoyaki, I tried a lot takoyaki among GTA. I think takoyaki here could be top 3. I also had okonomitaki and hiroshimayaki there. They are pretty good. The sauce and powers are mixed properly. The little sweet okonomitaki sauce mixed with mayo makes the tastes pretty good. They served the plates in a big portion, I even not able to finish a whole plate by myself. But there is a combo which served half half of the meal that you can try in diversity and choose the one your favourite. But unfortunately, the hiroshimataki cannot cut into half. So if you want to try hiroshimayaki, there is only one big size that you can choose. Also, you can try sukiyaki there, which is a Japanese hot pot. The soup of the sukiyaki  is fresh and tasty. Because this is a small place, they only offer the small pot of sukiyaki. The meat in the pot is a little bit sweet, which is properly. 
I have visited this place many times and I am going to try the whole menu hahah."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's unpretentious and serves simple Japanese food at reasonable prices. The place is small and better suited for take out. 

My GF is Japanese and she says the Takoyaki here are the best (in Canada). I had a curry rice and well...it tasted like curry rice. Everything feels kind of homey, but delicious. Portion is decent size. The lady working there is Japanese. 

I would come again if I'm looking for non-sushi Japanese food."}
{"text":"3.5-4 star rating. This feels like going to a Japanese person's home and they're making you a homemade meal.

I've been dying to try this place out for months, wanting to sit in and dine. But every time I look inside, the tables are taken. But to be fair, this is more of a takeout place. And there are two small tables inside. Anyways, came here for a late lunch today and luckily it was empty. I ordered their katsu curry and takes about 20 mins or so to make it. The curry itself was filling, it had potatoes, carrot and little beef cubes. The rice wasn't sticky but felt like it just got cooked. The katsu was very crispy! 

Overall, great place and I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"(C1) Takoyaki + Okonomiyaki combo 
Takoyaki was on point (hot), better than okonomiyaki.

Chicken katsu curry rice was basic and salty. 

The price is alright if you get two items on the menu and share. 

During lunch it wasn't as crowded so we dined in, food came out faster than expected.

Overall, I would come back again and try their other items. I still have yet to try their beef sukiyaki that people have been writing about."}
{"text":"Omfg the takoyaki is amazing!! Crispy outside soft on the inside. I will def come back to try their other menu items!!"}
{"text":"Ordered takoyaki and okonomiyaki.

Both were good. The orders did take longer than I expected considering I was the only customer during the quiet weekday afternoon, but I don't mind. It does taste like the lady took the time to put something nice together.

Only peeve was I meant to try the 'pancake' made from noodles. I've only had 'okonomiyaki' a few times and they were always made with noodle, so I didn't know that apparently the real noodle version is called 'Hiroshimayaki'. That was what I had in mind of ordering, but instead got mixed up and got the batter version/okonomiyaki instead. Just a heads-up.

Probably wouldn't consider sitting in though, because although the place wasn't busy while I was there, it already felt stuffy, greasy and hot from the kitchen. I recommend getting the orders to go.


Otherwise, good find."}
{"text":"This place is aces.

It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall that you wouldn't notice at all (probably seats 4-6, I don't know how people figure it could seat 10+) and giving it 5 stars makes me feel like M.F.K. Fisher pointing out a hidden gem that most ~*uncultured tourists*~ will never see. (There's your shot of culture for today.) The exterior signage just indicates Japanese food, so you might not see it right away. It's right off the corner of Yonge and Byng, kind of close to the condo complex thing on Doris Avenue.

I'd previously dropped by once for a couple onigiri because I was really close. The onigiri were boring - not flavorful, but the rice was cooked and formed well. The onigiri don't get the 5-star rating. What that's for is my second visit, where I ordered the half okonomiyak/karayaki combo (C2 on the menu). I also got a croquette, mainly because I felt weird placing an ~$8 order over the phone for pick-up. (The lady on the phone was really nice and didn't make me feel weird. It was all me.)

The okonomiyaki was crisped very nicely on the top and the powdered seaweed added a lot. Very savory, thick pancake, very filling. I got the mayo on the side and I was very pleased with that choice. As such, you should get the (Kewpie) mayo. The karayaki (basically a folded savory crepe, similar to the okonomiyaki aside from texture) was really good too - there was some pickled ginger there which I wouldn't normally be fond of but loved in this dish.

The simple croquette that I almost didn't order was really good too. The breading was crisp in that pleasantly light way where it feels almost flaky when you bite it. It wasn't heavy-feeling. The mashed potato inside was so beautifully soft. It might have been a little bland for some, but I felt the textures elevated it and the breading and filling were tasty enough that it didn't matter. It was a really good size also - would be a great snack for later if you're picking stuff up anyway.

I would definitely recommend placing your order ahead of time, both because it's such a small place and because everything is made fresh to order by a staff of 2. That said, I really think that for what it's serving, it can't be beat."}
{"text":"As a marathon runner prepares for his run, I prepared myself for tomorrow with a full CARB diet of Japanese Vegetable Ramen($4.48) at Naniwa-Taro.  I just love their Octopus logo, I think it means you can get your Takoyaki($4.25/6, $4.98/8) on at this place.

As like others I waited and waited until one of the man/woman from the back came to the front but others not as patient will leave, that's not my style though.  Got the RAMEN and C1 Combo which includes 1/2 an Okonomiyaki and 4 Takoyaki, my regular order.

Ramen came first in their own reusable BOWL, not a throw-away that the other Food Court Restos give out.  It smelled great and noticed Sesame Oil from the smell and look.  Bean Sprouts, Shredded Carrots, Thin Onion and a spoonful of Scallions top this Vegetable Ramen.  

The Soup was delicious and original thought was Soya base but after a few more tries, it was Dark MISO.  You can notice that distinct Miso cloud when it settles.  Ramen was thinner therefore less chewiness, but still good.

Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki were both FRESH made to order and Takoyaki was gooey and hot as always with that Octopus bite inside.  Okonomiyaki was A-OK and better than some others I've been to, it was full of Vegetables too.  Katsuobushi, Mayo, Aonori, and Sauce served on top.

It does take time to prepare the Yaki-items but well worth the wait and value wise it's spot on.  Food Court therefore no need to tip plus most items here are $5 to $10 range.  You can't go wrong, even when mine was a slightly toasty I don't mind.  Go when they're not busy but at the same time they open weird hours/days, so be PATIENT!    

:)  3.5 *Stars*"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Friday. There's not much room for seating but they do have takeout as well. There's also a bit of a wait for food, so it might be best to order and roam around for a bit.  If you can't eat pork, please indicate beforehand as the default for C1 is pork. 

HOWEVER, we did enjoy the food. We ordered C1 which was the takoyaki and okonomiyaki combo. The takoyaki was some of the best that I've ever had. It tasted like there actually was octopus and the batter wasn't heavy like you see at other places. The takoyaki was very soft and tender when you bit into it. We also ordered the green onion takoyaki on the side. I liked the takoyaki that came with C1, over the green onion version. 

The pork okonomiyaki was better than the shrimp version. This was done pretty well as well and is definitely best eaten fresh. It was tender and flavourful.

Overall, I would considering returning if I ever craved takoyaki."}
{"text":"Nice little place. I've lived in Japan for a few months and this place has pretty authentic Japanese food. Okonomiyaki was really good.  It's more of a take out place, since they only have 2 tables. Call ahead, I noticed the orders take a little time to make. Will be back to try their Japanese curry and other items."}
{"text":"It's nothing but authentic! We love the food here, it's run by a Japanese couple, the cook is the husband, while the wife is the cashier. 

Their prices are unbeatable, and the taste is definitely spot on. 

The only downside is that they don't have a lot of room so be ready to order your food to go just in case.

We love this place so much we will definitely be coming back in the future for more!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is definitely Japanese and everything was delicious! It's a small place with barely any seating, so take-out is recommended unless you don't mind cramped seating. Orders do take a while to be made but it's worth the wait! Everything comes out piping hot and fresh. This place is also cash only. 

I had the Okonomiyaki, Curry Udon, Omurice, Takoyaki, Yakiudon, and Chicken Katsu. The Takoyaki is made a bit differently here, it's not quite crisp on the outside and the inside is more batter/doughy like. The texture reminds me of pancake batter. They are generous with the filling however, with big chunks of octopus. I'm not a fan of the Takoyaki here, but the croquettes are to die for! They're perfectly crisp on the outside and piping hot, while the inside is so creamy, fluffy, buttery, and melt in your mouth! It's even better with the sauce that comes with it, which is a little tart and sweet. Seriously, get the croquettes! They are infinitely better than McDonald's and will change your life. 

The curry is pretty good, very thick and gravy like. Omurice is tastes very homey and the rice doesn't taste old, also pretty good. Yakiudon wasn't really anything special, tastes like your average stir-fry noodles. Chicken Katsu was really good, the crispiness is like melt in your mouth righ after the crunch and the chicken is juicy as well. Prices are okay, they're pretty average for Japanese food. Overall, an awesome place to eat and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THE CROQUETTES!!!!"}
{"text":"Really decent price. Takoyaki is amazing. If you like that, get the okonomiyaki, the hiroshimayaki, all that other jazz. It'll probably suit your taste buds as well. Owned by real Japanese people. They put a lot of effort into the food they make. Portions are decent sized too."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of their old location (although it was quite far away for me) and I'm a big fan of this new location. It's small, and there aren't many seats, but they have bar seating, and that's kinda cute. It's winter, and when the door opens, the restaurant gets cold, but they have a heater going, and it's sooo warm.

The menu has a lot of okonomiyaki (Japanese savory pancake) variations, and curry rice sets, udon dishes, takoyaki (they're known for this).

Had:

Hiroshimayaki - Almost like okonomiyaki, but with yakisoba noodles at the bottom. In other words, we had crispy yakisoba noodles tossed in okonomi sauce(I think) topped with a layer of sprouts and cabbage, which was then topped with a thin layer of batter, and blanketed by okonomi sauce, kewpie mayo (the Japanese mayo. Mmmm so good), and a sprinkling of seaweed powder (I must learn what the term for this is), shreds of pickled ginger (more red than pink) and bonito flakes. They're quite generous with the bonito. Somewhere in there, there were pieces of squid. This is super savory and there's a bunch of textures and stuff. I prefer this to the okonomiyaki because, as I mentioned before, there's noodles.

Takoyaki and karayaki - 4 pieces of takoyaki and an order of karayaki (on the menu, it's listed as tamakarayaki).. Takoyaki is the squid balls (outside is golden brown, inside is soft and fluffy. Octopus was a bit chewy. Also scalding hot, the way it should be), and karayaki is like a folded crepe with kewpie, that powdered seaweed, and bonito on top. Yummy stuff. I really like these combinations where you get to try two different orders.

Curry pork cutlet on rice - Pork cutlet was crispy. Curry sauce was addictive. Interestingly enough, we found small pieces of what I believe was beef in our curry sauce. Yes! Extra protein!

Each item we ordered was under $10. Very reasonable prices. Also very considerate service. We were going to buy bottled water. The lady who took our order told us she would just give us cups and we could get water (hot and cold) from their water dispenser. That was a nice touch. She also gave us our cutlery and napkins in a cute little basket.

I came with my cousin. When we got our food, we thought we wouldn't be able to finish it all (there was quite a bit of food). Yeah. We finished it because it was really that delicious.

I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here because of the consistently good reviews for this Japanese restaurant. This place literally seats 8 people in the whole restaurant which has a takeout restaurant vibe. Ventilation is also not the greatest as the restaurant had a very strong smell of fried food when we were there.

We ordered takoyaki (6pieces for $6.48) with mayonnaise on the side, and hiroshimayaki ($8.48)(Hiroshima style okonomiyaki). The takoyaki came out first. It was flavourful and had a decent sized piece of octopus in the middle but was a little too soft and batter like in the middle for my taste. I personally preferred the flavour and texture of the takoyaki I had at one of the izakayas closer to Yonge and Sheppard. 

The hiroshimayaki had a distinctive pickled ginger flavour but although there is a choice of shrimp, pork or another meat, there really wasn't much actual meat in the hiroshimayaki.  Only had a few skimpy pieces of bacon and maybe a few pieces of ground pork. We did enjoy the hiroshimayaki which was like a vegetable and noodle pancake with a savoury sauce and bonito flakes on top. It wasn't like the okonomiyaki that we had when we went to Hiroshima but alas, I have come to terms with the fact that in order to relive my food experience in Japan, I'll just need to travel there again.

As others have mentioned there is a value option to get half order of okonomiyaki with 4 pieces of takoyaki for $7.98. Given this better value, I would probably get this special as a takeout order the next time I return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Naniwa-Taro is a small restaurant that sits maybe about 10 people. It's run by an old Japanese couple who make authentic Japanese hot food. Since it's only the two of them and they make everything fresh when you order, it can be a bit of a wait so be prepared for that. There is paid street parking right outside, but not many spots, hence the 4 stars. It is a short walk from the closest subway station which is Finch. 

I tried the Takoyaki and Pork Okonomiyaki combo, I enjoyed it. It was a reasonable amount of food for the price. Definitely will come back to try the curry, which I have heard is also good."}
{"text":"They used to have a location in the T&T on steeles and middlefield (I believe it was) and just 2 years ago they closed, but I've finally found them again and they are the same nice people and the food is still absolutely delicious. I've tried many takoyaki from many many restaurants both in Toronto and markham but so far no has beat this amazing place. It's so affordable and delicious, although the wait time may be long but it is so worth it!! I always recommend this place to anyone i know that's looking for good authentic Japanese food. Wish I lived closer so I can eat here more often"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for some time now but had no luck w/ their old location (inside T&T supermarket). Aside from odd hours, they close during festivals like Taste of Asia. So of course I had to get something since it's finally open.  

This is a mom and pops type of shop and the owners are from Japan. They sell Japanese street food such as takoyaki, karayaki, and okonomiyaki (both Hiroshima & Osaka style). Other items include udon, ramen, omurice, donburi, fried noodles etc. 

I had the okonomiyaki and it was quite tasty. The batter (made up of flour, grated yam, dashi, eggs, and shredded cabbage) wasn't too dense or heavy, and it went well with the okonomiyaki sauce & bonito flakes. It also had a nice sear and wasn't oily at all. Portion was decent. 

The downside is the long wait (15-20 mins) since everything is made fresh to order. It's also a small place with two tables so it's best to get take-out. I'll be back soon for their famous takoyaki."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork cutlet w/curry and squid okonomiyaki. Was very pleased! 
Had takoyaki on a previous visit and that was good too."}
{"text":"Hard to see the the actual name of the place because it's in teeny tiny letters. I knew I was in the right place when I saw in large letters \"AUTHENTIC JAPANESE FOOD\". Street parking (paid and the small free parking across the street at ZenQ) is a pain because it's always full; you'll need to wait for a spot to open up. You shouldn't wait too long because the turn over is quick, most people get take out.

I ordered the ever popular C1- Takoyaki and Okonomiyaki combo and the Pork Katsu Curry with rice. I could hear them in the back whipping up the batter for my food; it came out hot and fresh in 15 minutes. I appreciate that they poked out holes in the styro to-go containers to let out the steam and prevent sogginess; they even packed the curry sauce separate from the katsu.

As soon as I opened the first container, the bonito flakes started dancing; I had to take a minute to enjoy the show. The takoyaki was an explosion of flavors with the highlight being the savory and delicious octopus. The consistency reminded me of something between a thick custard and a moist bread pudding, interesting indeed. Thanks Camen T. for the warning, the inside was super hot like molten lava! The okonomiyaki was flavorful as well. I wouldn't order the C1 combo next time because both have strong flavors which together was overpowering, I enjoyed more eating them with the rice that came with my curry dish.

The panko breading on the katsu was light and crisp and the curry was chunky (pieces of meat, carrots and potatoes) with a hint of spice: tasty indeed. Would definitely recommend for a light on the go lunch."}
{"text":"Run by an aging couple, this place is literally a hole in the wall with 12 seats for the inside. This is a great place for ordering lunch during work hours; however, aside from that that, it is a difficult thing to say whether you would want to go with a friend there on account of the small interior. They had no ability to serve better because they are a duo, so usually, both were in the kitchen making the food, which left the front / our table unchecked. However, if you had their attention, you were sure to have their attention and see that your needs were attended. We came a bit earlier than their opening time, but it was OK because the husband saw that we were outside and opened the door earlier than usual to keep us from waiting outside in the cold.

On the other side, the food was good and it's home-style. There was sukiyaki, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, etc. The prices were also very good and cheap. The portions were decent as well and I really want to go back to try the sukiyaki one day (under $9!). 

My table ordered the omurice, takoyaki and some-yaki. I can't remember what that yaki was, started with an \"M\". Takoyaki came out hot, done right and had a nice-sized octopus piece inside. I wouldn't say it is THE best I've had in Toronto though. 

Price: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Price Point: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I used to always come here when my boyfriend lived in the area! When we first started dating, I had the strangest Okonomiyaki craving - since it had been 4 years since I had it last. So on our first date I decided to take us here. I was initially taken aback by the tiny storefront with minimal seating, as I expected a sit down restaurant since it had such positive reviews. Luckily that didn't repel us away. I ordered C1 which comes with okonimiyaki and takoyaki, and my boyfriend got one of the basic beef noodle dishes (forgive my memory, this was nearly a year ago). We got those to go, and I was immediately hooked! 
For the next 4 months, we'd always visit about 1-2 times a month. It has probably been about 8 months since I've had it last, but I'm definitely due for a visit!

So to sum it all up!

Pros: okonomiyaki and takoyaki are fantastic, good menu select with a variety of noodle dishes, hot pot and appetizers/side orders, EXTREMELY AFFORDABLE - no more than $10 a person!
Cons: long wait times, you need to pay for street parking (so call ahead of have a buddy wait in the car in case the parking guy comes), and minimal seating"}
{"text":"Ordered the 1/2 Okonomiyaki + Takoyaki combo, Grilled Eel with egg on rice and 2 croquettes. Pro-tip: Call beforehand and order or it'll take a REALLY long time. 

Anyway, the food here is always fresh because they cook it when you order so it's guaranteed to be steaming hot when you get it. The croquettes were really really good! A must try.

The takoyaki + okonomiyaki combo was really worth it and delicious as well... Nice and crispy takoyakis are the best. 

Lastly, the grilled eel on rice was pretty solid, eel was delicious and the whole dish overall was really good.

Verdict: Really good and a must try if you're in the area. 

That's all."}
{"text":"authentic Japanese diner. Small and clean with simple menus like curry, udon and taros."}
{"text":"While I can't claim to be an Okonomiyaki connoisseur I do have some limited(albeit authentic) experience with this stuff. I had the pleasure of feasting on this dish daily in Osaka (birthplace of this dish or so they say). I must admit I was no huge fan of it when I first tried it and even now I don't fancy it either but it has grown on me a bit. Even the infamous Mizuno that stands tall up on Mt. Rushmore of Okonomiyakis did little sway my taste buds.

Now with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised by Naniwa-Taro; this stuff is good. The batter is light, thin and airy with almost a \"rice paper\" kind of affect --the way it melts in your mouth. Noodles are soft and slightly chewy with just a right amount of texture. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly sauced with gentle waves of flavours caressing your taste buds. The balance of the flavours are incredible which absolutely defines what Japanese cuisine should be. Delicately made with utmost care, this is no Mizuno however it's not trailing too far behind.

The same can be said of the tacoyaki. Delicate with a creamy smooth center (a la Lindt) with hints of octopus, seaweed and wasabi all wrapped in a thin, caramelized dough with a slight crisp.

The reason I am taking away 1 star is for the mediocre udon soup and omelette rice. I would suggest you skip these."}
{"text":"Anyone who has eaten at Ebi-Ten in Vancouver should come check out this nook.

I finally decided to get some take-out from this place. It's almost a hidden spot if you walk pass Byng Avenue.
Like all the other reviewers were saying, the place really is small and it's better to get take-out than eating in unless you do prefer your meal as soon as it's brought to you. This is the most \"mom and pop\" looking Japanese eatery and I can't think of any other place in Toronto that has this sort of setting. And also this seems to be the first place in Toronto I've come across that features mostly \"Yoshoku\" meals on its menu. Go and check it out and you'll get what I mean.
I got the Okonomiyaki with Takoyaki combo and a Curry Omurice and this is probably the first Japanese place in all of Toronto that I've had an Omurice from.
I had both of them for dinner and they were comfort food level tasty, even though the Okonomiyaki tasted the best out of the three things. My stomach was filled up and happy. The flavor might have tasted better if I had eaten them right there and then, which I'll have to do one of these days.
I would still recommend this to people who are craving for Japanese food that is slightly more homely looking when compared to the Izakayas and the Sushi places in the city."}
{"text":"Prepare to wait if you order your food on the spot. It's made fresh on the spot. My suggestion if you're in a rush,
call ahead of time so the food will be ready by the time you get there.

I've been eating here since T&T opened back in 2005. It helps that I live right across the intersection. I am always content to wait because they make the best takoyaki I've had and I've tried quite a bit. It's not everyday you find takoyaki that has one piece of octopus in each piece of takoyaki. 

My go-to order is Combo 1, which includes 4 pieces of takoyaki and a half order of mixed okonomiyaki. It's the best of both worlds and doesn't break the bank. 

My only gripe is that they close up shop to do food fairs, leaving me and my takoyaki cravings unfulfilled."}
{"text":"Experience was pretty bad. The takoyaki wasn't the greatest, there's better places Downtown. It was sort of bland, lacking some flavour to it. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. I definitely suggest for you to order for pick up. The place is fairly small as well so eat in is available, but not conducive for a group greater than 4. Ordered takoyaki and mixed hiroshimayaki. Takoyaki was not crisp as I had hoped, but very tasty. The hiroshimayaki had a very rich taste. The place was ok, definitely not the best takoyaki imo. The waiting also turned me off."}
{"text":"I got myself the takoyaki here today.  I purposely drove all the way to this area just to see if this takoyaki is as great as everybody claimed.

I ordered the green onion takoyaki just for kicks.  I waited for about 10-15 minutes for it.  I finally got it.  It was nice and hot when given to me, and it was absolutely delicious!  The takoyaki was a bit crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and had a great texture with the octopus within it!  The green onions gave it a great kick as well!  I was QUITE impressed.

Best takoyaki thus far?  Still debating between this and Guu!  QUITE delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm Japanese and I've been looking for authentic takoyaki place for a long time. I'm from Osaka (place where takoyaki was originated from) and is very picky about how it tastes. I've tried many places and I never liked any of them until I found this place. This place is the closest to authentic I could find in Toronto. I felt like I was back in Osaka again when I had their takoyaki. I've been coming to this place every chance I get to try all their menus, and so far I love every single one of them. I've brought couple of friends over and they also love this place. They make it on the spot fresh for you, so it takes time but it's worth the wait. If you don't want to wait, call ahead of time an when you walk in the store, they will have it ready for you. Their price is reasonable as well. If you want to know how Osaka authentic takoyaki tastes, I recommend this place !! It's a very small place but their food is amazing. Definitely Will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I've been on a kind of Yonge-Finch/Yonge-Sheppard food crawl the past few days and I'm so glad I decided to dine at this hole in the wall of a restaurant. My friend and I dined in and each ordered the half okonomiyaki with 4 takoyaki. It's not a literal half of an okonomiyaki by the way, just a smaller circle.

We waited around 10-15 minutes for our food to get to our table and it was piping hot. One of the 5 things I absolutely LOVE at a restaurant is when food arrives hOt. When I say hot I mean \"I want the food to give my mouth second-degree burns\" hot. After my tastebuds healed and could start doing their tastebud-tasting I can confidently say that this is the best okonomiyaki I've ever had! Because it's the only okonomiyaki I've ever had! Hah! It really was good though and my friend who has tried Okonomiyaki House thought this was better. The takoyaki was just as hot but the exterior was a little too soft for my liking. 

Glad I got to try this place and will be back to try their Japanese curry and get more okonomiyaki."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while, so I was happy to finally strike this off my list. I have to say, I wasn't very impressed. We tried the takoyaki, okonomiyaki and the pork katsu curry rice. All were acceptable, but not great. The breading of the pork left much to be desired - a thin exterior without too much of a crunch, and the curry was fine, but too little of it. It should really fill up most of the plate, so that it can cover the rice and the pork. And the rice - boo. The quality of the grain was very low. I'm sorry to say, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Byng Ave along Yonge Steet at a residential condo area, Naniwa-Taro is a nice local hidden jewel which serves authentic Japanese snacks. 

Like many shops near the condo area, Naniwa-Taro has very limited seating (8 chairs in total) and it is only suitable for solo diners or groups of 2. It was very quiet when I visited on a Friday night, and I had a feeling many people would not have known about this restaurant if they aren't living in this area. I discovered this place through Yelp and decided to give it a try because the photos looked nice. 

I ordered the C1 combo because it was recommended by the other reviews here on Yelp and the value was good. For $6.99 you get 1/2 portion of Okonomitaki and 4 Takoyaki, which gives you a taste of their signature items while keeping you full. Since there was only 1 person running the shop at night it took a good 15 minutes for my dish to come. Unfortunately, when my dish came I was a little disappointed at how it looked, because it wasn't as pretty as the other photos on Yelp due to how poorly they put on the mayo. The food still tasted really good though, I liked how the texture of both the Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki were really soft and fluffy, and the sauces were just right and not too salty or over-powering. 

I would still recommend others to give this restaurant a try, because its food is really delicious, authentic, and for a reasonable price. I see that they had added Sukiyaki (Japanese hot pot) on their menu recently, which is perfect for the winter season, can't wait to give that a try next time!"}
{"text":"This tiny shop is tucked away on one of the side streets.. I've been passing by all the time without even knowing about it! First of all, don't come here expecting authentic fancy Japanese food (I know.. the sign says otherwise). However, if you want a quick and cheap Japanese meal, be sure to come here! I think the quality of food here is more like a food court, and it is good for the price! They do take a while to make the food though, so prepare for the wait."}
{"text":"Great small little Japanese restaurant. It is a small mom and pop business ran by an older couple. If it weren't for Yelp, we probably would have walked right past it. 

We ordered 2 Croquettes ($2 each), A5 Sukiyaki ($10.98) and C1 which was half Okonmiyaki and 4 Takoyaki ($7.98). 

The croquettes were deep fried, comprised of potato and some veggies. They were made fresh and came piping hot to our table. 

The sukiyaki was a hot pot dish with beef, napa, tofu and connyaku. Connyaku are basically shirtaki noodles which are thin glass like noodles. The hot pot came really hot! It was still bubbling when it was brought to our table. The beef was nice, had a good flavour and was a bit sweet. 

The Okonmiyaki and Takoyaki were good as well! Everything we ordered was made fresh and delivered hot to our table. It was yum, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I however, didn't like how they put mayo in the side instead of drizzling it overtop.

The service here can be a bit slow as it is run by 2 people and they do get quite busy. We were fortunate enough to beat the rush so we didn't have to wait long for our food. However, this group that came before us and ordered take out, didn't get their food until we finished ours. I would recommend ordering ahead of time, or not coming here if you're in a rush. Aside from that, the service was great. The lady working the front was friendly and she told us what each item was when she brought to our table. 

Also, this is definitely more of a take out place, seating only 8. Not everyone eats in, but the tables do get occupied by people waiting for their take out. 

In all, I would come back and try their other menu items. The food was made fresh, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, it really is - especially when youre craving something different from a food court. Like takoyaki, or okonomiyaki - both of which I crave now and again. Conveniently located inside the T & T, it's a good place to stop for a quick snack (or meal, if you so choose) before or after doing your groceries... 
The reason they rated so low with me is that the service here is painstakingly SLOW - and they make no apologies for it (as we speak, Ive been waiting 25 minutes for a TAKEOUT order). Every time I order takoyaki, I have to be sure that Ive got nowhere to be anytime soon. The takoyaki, and even the okonomiyaki, are not the best Ive had by any means (a little too salty, and often too saucy)... But since so few places serve these dishes in this part of town, I dont have much of a choice. It does the job, however, of satisfying a somewhat rare craving."}
{"text":"This review is based off the curry dishes. In short it just doesn't come close to Indian, Thai, Malaysian curry flavors. I found the Japanese style curry to be very bland and boring in taste. But I could have came to this conclusion because the day before I went to Thai Basil which had amazing flavors in their curry. I tried the deep fried chicken dish and the pork cutlet dish with curry for about $7 each. The meat was also pretty tasteless and dry. Can't say anything positive about this place. Even had to wait about 10 minutes for them to prepare everything but at least we know its made fresh. Its located inside T&T food court so I wasn't expecting anything great anyways. Just wanted a quick lunch. This is on the never return list in my books."}
{"text":"Waiting time is slow. You have to be patient with them preparing food. 
This is why I deducted 1 star.

Otherwise, I think this place is awesome.
The food is authentic.
I usually get their Octopus ball, Hiroshima Yaki, and Curry Udon."}
{"text":"Takoyaki is the only the best here but still 6 out of 10. But the rest of the food is shit."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are such good reviews but last night I checked this place out with a friend and we were both thoroughly disappointed. 

As other people have mentioned it's a small place more for takeout. There's two tables and individual seating (4 seats) by the cashier. You get a foam cup for water after ordering your meal (if you're dining in). 

I ordered C4 which is the Meat Udon Soup with onigiri (8.48$) and my friend ordered the same but without the onigiri (6.98$). It took 30 minutes for the Udon to be ready and another 5-10 minutes after that for the onigiri. 

I admit the food is fresh but nothing special about it. Looks like something I could make at home for a fraction of the price and time. The broth was simple not overly salty and a typical taste. The onigiri was bland and lacked flavour. It tasted like white rice but shaped in a triangle. There was minimal seasoning but meh it isn't worth getting. 

I don't think I will be back. It's disappointing for having such an extensive menu if you're unable to cook something simple even relatively decent."}
{"text":"First time I noticed that a restaurant at 7 Byng Ave. It's so small but food is delicious and I will go more and recommend to my friends"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. It's a small take out restaurant with 2 tables and a bar table that can seat a total of 8 people. It's a cute little place to grab a quick lunch with couple friends. 

My husband and I had lunch there on a Sunday afternoon around 2. We ordered a sukiyaki hot pot served with white rice (tofu beef soup) and a pork, shrimp & squid Hirosimayaki (noodles with little cabbage inside a pan-fried batter). 

The sukiyaki hot pot was nice on a cold day, it was still bubbling when served to the table in a stone pot. The soup itself is too sweet for us. There was plenty of beef in the pot which is nice.

The Hirosimayaki has a choice of pork, shrimp, squid or mix of the three. We ordered the mix, but I didn't see a lot of those in there. Some noodles is not wrapped inside the batter so it got crunchy when pan-frying which is nice. A lot of noodles so it's very filling. Wish there was a little more of the brown sauce inside, overall was good. 

It is more of a take out restaurant so don't too much. They will bring you the food and there is a water machine so you can get your own water with the provided foam cup (hot/cold). They also serve drinks. 

They also have some Japanese comic book (about 5 super thick mixed stories) if you are interested. 

The restaurant is located on Yonge, so parking maybe limited."}
{"text":"Great place. Tried okonomiyaki a few times and this is the best place so far. It's really small, but usually small places sell the best food. The food took a while, but I didn't mind because I've seen how takoyaki has been made and it takes a while, and there were other people waiting for their order. Overall, great place, there was actually squid in the okonomiyaki. Definitely will come back and eat more food!"}
{"text":"Nanniwa Taro is a small place tucked away on Yonge and Byng Ave. It is run by a Japanese couple and is a make to order kind of place with only one person in the kitchen so you will expect longer wait times.
It is meant for take out but there is a side table that can seat 4 people and 2 small tables.

There were many items to choose from including okonomayaki, takoyaki balls,  modanyaki, yoshoku, hirishimiyaki, dons, soba noodles, and katsus just to name a few.

In the end I decided to try the Okonomiyaki (mixed) which comes with squid, shrimp, and pork - $7.98. You can also choose to have only one of the toppings as well for $6.48

It was about a 10 min wait to order, and 30 min wait for the food.

My first bite - The Okonomayaki was crispy on the outside and creamy but not too dense on the inside. The crispy batter part was not too oily as well. The presentation of it was nice, drizzled with mayo and a thick brown sauce that tastes vinegary and sweet. It is topped with moving bonito flakes as well. As for the filling there are some small shrimps and small pieces of squid tossed together, but couldn't really taste the pork. Overall the pancake probably tasted just ordinary due to the proportion of cream to shrimp/pork/squid in the filling but it was still good
 
I would still come back as the food is okay, but because the wait times are long I would give it a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"I noticed place while picking up an order from VIPS sushi.  Naniwa-Taro is next door and offers a lot cooked Japanese meals.

Pros:
Lots of authentic Japanese meals to choose from
Staff are very friendly

Cons:
Food takes a while
Small space

When you first come in, you notice the place is very small.  There are two tables and then the place where you place your order.  This place is mainly for take out.  I've been told this place used to be in the TNT food court at Middlefield and Steeles.  

One look at the menu and you notice they have a lot to offer.  If you're a fan of Japanese food, this is your kinda of place.  They have various meals ranging from rice bowls, curry to yakisoba.  They had so many items that my GF and I couldn't decide on what to get.  We ended up getting the chicken katsu curry, beef oyakodon and an order of takoyaki.

The food itself was very good.  It's always a good thing to know that the staff at the restaurant are the same nationality as the food they serve.  The curry was your basic curry with some veggies in it.  The chicken though was very good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The oyakodon was very good as well.  One thing to note is they give you an ample amount of rice.  You will be full after a meal here if you eat everything.

Orders here take a little longer to get to you.  I think we waited about 15-20 minutes to get our food.  This is probably due to them making some items fresh to order.  Takoyaki is something you need to make fresh.  You can't make it ahead of time and hold it later to serve.  It doesn't taste the same and people can tell right away.  I don't mind wait time when it comes to reasons like this.

I have a small gripe with the size of this place.  It forces you to basically take out.  Some of the items on the menu are best eaten right out of the kitchen.  This includes the takoyaki we ordered.  We only live 5 minutes away from this place but by the time we got home it already wasn't the same as if we had eaten it there.  I would definitely be a more frequent customer if they had a better seating area.  Still, apart from a few items, you won't notice this too much.

Naniwa-Taro is a great place in the Yonge and Finch area if you're craving Japanese food.  I will definitely be back to try the other items I want to try."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the Takoyaki and Shrimp Tempura with rice. I normally wouldn't order Tempura at a food court because I'm usually disappointed. But seeing the owner/cook is Japanese I expected a decent bowl of Tempura with rice. It took a good 15 minutes to get my food and I was the only order they have on hand. 

When I got my tempura with rice I knew I was going to hate myself for ordering it. The tempura batter is obviously wrong because it looked like a piece of fish and chips with the thick batter instead of the light fluffy tempura batter. The rice was overcooked that I thought I ordered porridge. They also gave me regular soy sauce instead of tempura sauce. So I went back to them and told them I wanted Tempura sauce, they gave me the same sauce. I'm pretty sure they have no idea what tempura sauce is. This is by far the worst tempura rice I have ever had - including some really crappy food court places. 

The Takoyaki is o-k. It's a little soggy for my liking because there's just too much sauce that the Takoyaki looked like an inflated ball underneath a bunch of crap. It was also a bit salty because there's just too much sauce. 

Maybe I had too much expectations that the cook was Japanese and expected better quality food. But I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who wants decent Japanese food - even for food court."}
{"text":"The Takoyaki was awesome! Cooked to perfection. It was my first time there and I ordered the C1 Combo - half Okonomiyaki and 4 pcs of Takoyaki to take away. Even though the lady said it would take 15 minutes, I ended up waiting for close to 25 minutes even though it didn't look busy. However, the owner was such a sweet and friendly lady, I couldn't really get upset for the wait. 
The Okonomiyaki was good too but I would have been really happy to just have gotten the full order of Takoyaki. I'll definitely call ahead the next time I order from them."}
{"text":"The takoyaki was fantastic. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. This isn't the frozen takoyaki you get served in many other Japanese restaurants in the city, but is made fresh just like in Japan. However, that does mean it takes some time before you can get your order so call ahead!

Next time, I want to try the gyudon. Actually, I want to try the entire menu. The entire menu is reasonably priced and all items are listed in Japanese and English."}
{"text":"Naniwa-Taro is so good, it's brings a taste of the night markets to your dinner (or lunch) table!

It's a small Japanese restaurant (tucked away on a side street off of Yonge Street) which specializes in a variety of fried foods such as Okonomiyaki, Takoyaki, Croquettes, Shrimp Tempura, Udon Soups, Katsu, Curry, Noodles and Rice Combos. 

This place is the real deal and all food is made fresh upon ordering. Be prepared to allow some time flexibility for the chefs to prepare your meal, it's well worth the wait! The owners are the nicest people too. 

Their Okonomiyaki was far better than other restaurants in the city. The pancake dough was perfect with just the right amount of ingredients throughout it so that every bite was full of flavour and texture. Same goes for their Takoyaki, which was bursting with flavour and served steaming hot. 
If you haven't had these dishes before, try them here, they make some of the best dishes in the city!"}
{"text":"I wanted to eat takoyaki and okonomiyaki one day and was in the area so I decided to check this place out due to the good reviews on Yelp. The first time I went, they were closed! So here's a warning: if you want to try this place out, make sure you check by calling ahead or see the schedule paper posted on the door if they're open or not. 

I am glad that I called 20 minutes ahead for take-out because they are super duper slow. When I went into the restaurant to get my order after 30 minutes, they were still not done with my food and I only ordered the takoyaki + okonomiyaki combo ($6.99 + tax). The place is mostly for take-out as there are only ~ 6 chairs for dine-ins, so I'd think it would be faster. There was only one other person waiting so I don't know what took so long. 

The tiny restaurant seems to be owned by Japanese people as they were speaking in Japanese. In terms of the food, the takoyaki (4pcs) and the okonomiyaki (half) were alright, nothing too special. I definitely have had tasted better Japanese food elsewhere."}
{"text":"3.5 really close to a 4! 

The wait took forever but the food was good. We ordered

C1 - Okonomiyaki (half) + Takoyaki (4pcs) - This was awesome and must try.
K7 - Chicken Katsu Curry - Sauce was amazing
B5 - Sobameshi - It was a rice/noodle combo. It was bland and a bit dry. Skip
B8 - BBQ Beef Rice - Not a beef person but liked the flavours

Next time I'm getting noodles or a curry dish. But I would likely call first to order then pick up. We went in and waited likely 45 + mins..............Love the prices here as it's super cheap and portions were generous. 

The restaurant fits only 8 people. I would definitely recommend take-out."}
{"text":"A very small hidden away shack. It does have some seats available for eating in. However, majority of people would do take out at this restaurant. It is the best takoyaki I had in Toronto. Their Okonomiyaki is delicious too. It's owned by a couple and you can tell the food they serve is a nice home cooked Japanese. Prices are quite cheap with most dishes under $10. I personally wished I didn't live so far away. I would come here more often."}
{"text":"Great Japanese home food in north york area. Had chicken katsu curry and croquette. Croquette was decent appetizer size and very crispy. It was a little greasy since its deep fried. Recommend finishing it before it gets cold. Chicken for chicken katsu was salted so it was a bit too salty for me. But its ok. I really loved their curry and rice tho! Will come back to try other menu!"}
{"text":"Naniwa-Taro is my go-to place around this area for authentic Japanese food. Seating is limited (2 tables) so it mainly serves as a takeout place for most people. I've been a repeat customer of at least 7-8 times already and the food quality is always great and consistent. Some of the items I always order are Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki, Modanyaki, Chicken Katsu Curry, Grilled Eel Egg Rice, Omelette Rice, and BBQ Beef Rice. 

Their Chicken Katsu Curry is the most authentic Japanese curry I have tasted. It may not be as fancy as the katsu curry at Katsuya, but it certainly tastes like a delicious home-cooked Japanese curry. The owner is a super nice lady and always greets you with a smile. I can tell she really cares about the food she serves as well as her customers. Of all the places I get takeouts from, hers is the only place that pokes little holes on the lid of the Styrofoam container with toothpick, so that the condensation from the heat of the dishes does not make your food soggy by the time you get home. That to me is really what makes Naniwa-Taro special in my heart, getting takeout from there feels like getting a personal lunch box from my grandma."}
{"text":"Some photos of the food looks way better than the food itself. But the taste is good and authentic. Worth it a try!"}
{"text":"Naniwa-Taro is very authentic and inexpensive Japanese cousine place. Okonomiyake is wonderful there. Business owners are very nice people. The place is very small so you might see some line there sometimes. Good for take-out. If you want to try some authentic Japanese dish other then sushi it's a good place."}
{"text":"The aroma of the place reminded me of Japan. The flavours are good but they didn't use Japanese rice."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for around here. Price is reasonable since its in a food court. Food quality is great. Seems very authentic japanese taste and smell. Only downside is the wait could be long since they make the orders fresh so no complaints. 

I've only ordered Takoyaki and the pancakes. BTW.

Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I really appreciate this underrated Japanese restaurant in North York mainly because it's run by an older Japanese couple. This tiny place feels like their little family project and their food is definitely authentic, or at least, something that normal Japanese families would eat at home. You can't compare them to a 5 star Japanese rated restaurant in Toronto but Naniwa-Toro has some pretty traditional Japanese dishes - curry, udon, takoyaki, omurice, okonomiyaki, and etc. Everything is simple and homey here. I ordered the takoyaki and sukiyaki and really enjoyed both - it's truly like a small piece of Japan here. 

If you're looking for high-end Japanese food, move on."}
{"text":"Best takoyaki around! The various Japanese staples are also very authentic: okonomiyaki, Beef Udon, Katsudon,  Oyakodon all very delicious! 

They make everything to order and definitely worth the wait. Eat everything and do not take out because the food quality will definitely decrease! 

Prices are very reasonable and I definitely visit every time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"This place has been here like forever. I've always walked by this place and never tried. Finally came for a quick dinner on a weekday.

Half Okonomiyaki & 4 pieces of Takoyaki ($7.98)
I like how they have this mix and match combo cause ordering one of each would have been too much since we wanted to try a bit of both. I personally thought the okononmiyaki tasted better, although it really is the same ingredients but just in a different form. The okonomiyaki had a lot of cabbage and not just mostly batter which is probably why I really liked it, was loaded with ingredients! 

Beef bowl rice ($8.98)
This was a little disappointing, different than what I expected. The egg was overdone, not runny to mix with the beef and rice. The beef meat was thin and slightly chewy. I guess I was expecting more of a sukiyaki type of beef.

There is only one cook so the meal did take quite a while. The place is really small, 2 tables and the bar - it's more of a takeout place. Food was okay, I would come back to try their other things or if i'm looking for a snack."}
{"text":"This is one of the few restaurants I have given 5 stars. Wow. Thank you blogTO and Yelp! this place was on the top noodles list but boy there are so many good dishes here. Takoyaki is most authentic I've seen, soft not doughy and crispy on the outside. Udon is also fantastic. I wasn't eating meat on this particular day so she voluntarily substitute fish for me - so nice. It's a small place so can't come with a group which is too bad. Wish there was a picnic table outside the store.  Dishes take a bit long to make. Authentic Japanese food. Just don't come in here if you are heading to a fancy party the smell may stay with you. We will definitely keep coming back to try everything but this is now my to go place for udon and fried noodles."}
{"text":"i'm a big fan. when i heard the tnt at middlefield and steeles was closing. the first thing ithought of was, what's going to happen to naniwa-taro? i had to look for restaurants in the area and i happened to come across this shop and i was thinking, \"could it be?! is this THE naniwa-taro?\"

the answer is yes. i absolutely love this place i almost always order the omurice, but i should definitely start trying the other stuff. takoyaki is pretty much almost always a must as well. this time they had no more rice so that asked if i wanted to sub noodles instead of rice. omunoodles. personally, i think this was even better than omurice. i always have it topped with ketchup and mayo.

i think what i like most about naniwa-taro is that is tastes so homemade. there's a lot of japanese places in toronto, but this is the one place that truly reminds me of the flavours i tasted while i was in japan.

the place is super small. basically 2 tiny tables with 4 seats. it's definitely not intended for dine in lol."}
{"text":"Sublime takoyaki. Soft, tasty, fresh and hot melt-in-your-mouth amazeballs. Some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I ordered C1 since it looked like a good deal. I didn't expect such a long waiting time. This meant that they actually make everything hot and fresh which was a bit surprising for me. I asked for it take out but then I decided to eat there. There was only space for 8 chairs and a few tables. When I got my food, it was steaming hot! The okonomiyaki was very good and the takoyaki, I expected it to be undercooked but it was just as perfect. I will for sure come back and try their katsu and curry."}
{"text":"Don't underestimate this small establishment! Seats get filled quickly and there was a continuous flow of people coming in. Impressive. Although it was a bit cramped dining here, the food made up for it. We ordered the Takoyaki, Pork Katsu Curry, and Pouched Eggs Yakisoba. 

I enjoyed the Takoyaki very much. A light crunch on the outside with a hot and soft filling of pieces of octopus on the inside. (And please... don't stuff the whole Takoyaki in your mouth because you'll be in for a burning experience!) A lot of Takoyaki that I've tried in the past were mainly comprised of batter however, this one here is the real deal. Definitely a nice treat or appetizer to start with. The Pork Katsu Curry was my favourite of the night. I don't know what they did with the chicken but it was very tender and filled with flavour. The curry was very aromatic, not too salty or creamy it was of a good consistency. Quite a large portion I must say, for a good price too! Lastly, the Pouched Eggs Yakisoba was a 'nay' for me. Very bland and nothing out of the ordinary. Tasted like something you can replicate at home. We tried to revive it with some hot sauce and it did some justice... overall, the yakisoba was OK.

It takes some time for them to make the food so, remember to submit your order a head of time otherwise, you'll be sitting there salivating from the aroma! Also, if you want to dine there, remember to call in and make reservations! 

Will stop by again to try their other items."}
{"text":"This review for Naniwa-Taro will be based on the single item I ate there.. the Ramen. 

Yes I know.. it is bias
Yes I know... I should be ordering Takoyaki NOT a Ramen. 
Yes I know...I will be back again to try their Takoyaki and write an update, OK!

Finally Naniwa-Taro is opened after my numerous \"drop by\" attempt. Order the Vegetable Ramen with the pork option (extra $1). Don't order the Pork.. it is basically really fat pork meat boiled, really chewy and has no flavours at all. The soup base is one of the saltest I have, definitely not for you to drink as a soup! The noodle itself is ok, no bad.. but not something I will be daydreaming about.

After I ate the Ramen and grocery shopping in T&T, I have this urge to buy every cold refreshing drinks they have! Talks about MSG attack!

An update for Takoyaki from Naniwa-Taro will be available shortly! 

Stay Tuned!"}
{"text":"Small japanese snack bar in the Finch area. I came here because I was craving okonomiyaki and I was on the hunt for some good places in the area. Before I got here, I read that most people like to do take-out from this restaurant and call in to order beforehand, and just pick up on the way out. However, we forgot to do this and ate in instead. There's only a few tables in the tiny restaurant, and seating is pretty tight. You can definitely tell people take the food home usually.

We ordered the takoyaki and okonomiyaki combo. It wasn't anything special to be honest. I should've expected this because they're both made from similar ingredients. The other food on the menu looked pretty good and are reasonably priced. I think this place is a common spot for people to order lunch and pick up while they're at work, or to grab on their way home for dinner. It's actually authentic which i definitely appreciate too.

I'd probably come back and try the other items one day!"}
{"text":"Been a fan since they were at the food court of T and T. So happy I found them after getting my nails done in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"4 stars for the takoyaki!!! 
I order the takoyaki every single time. They don't skimp on the octopus, and the taste is very authentic. Would be better if the outside were a bit more crispier!"}
{"text":"They are located in the food court of TNT Supermarket. I was hesitant. I had the Hiroshima Okonomiyaki and I thought it was DELICIOUS! My husband had the regular Okonomiyaki and he loved it too. Great prices for great food. Better than the Okonomi House (which we tried the next day, and had to go back to this place the day after). 

The only downside is, they are a bit slow. It is probably because some of the food takes awhile to make, which is totally understandable, but they do not take orders until they are ready, even if they see you waiting. So make sure you go earlier than you want to eat. I absolutely hate waiting, but I will wait because it is that good. :)"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant.

Ordered chicken yakisoba and their infamous takoyaki for my dinner. 

Price and quality go hand in hand.

Portion is promising for $8.

Satisfied my tastebuds and will be back to try their other dishes.

Place is small so better to order take out.

Owner was very nice

Photos do not look too well because I left it in my car for a few hours."}
{"text":"Not really worth to go, we ordered the chicken katsu curry, takoyaki and the hamburg combo, the chicken Katsu curry is alright, not good and not bad, the down side about it is instead of using Japanese rice, they used some Chinese rice. Highly not recommended to order the Hamburg combo cause it just tastes like regular hamburger meat, the portion is extremely small, definitely not worth for the price and they used Chinese rice again. The takoyaki is nothing special, takoyaki is so much better at guu izakaya and the price is about the same as well."}
{"text":"I went on a friday night and it was empty inside, so that's good I could sit down and ate there. I ordered the takoyaki and deed fried pork chop. The price was very reasonable but it took very long time almost 40 mins (considered there was no one else there) . I know they made it fresh and the food came out very hot. But it wasn't worth the time to wait."}
{"text":"Came here because this place was recommended by a friend. To be honest I was quite disappointed. I ordered 5 dishes (around $10 each) and the best one is the Takoyaki. I was recommended here for the Okonomiyaki which I think was okay, might come back and give another chance. Would recommend Teppan Cave for the Okonomiyaki. Also tried the noodles which was plain, I'm suspecting the cook forgot to add seasonings. On the other hand, the beef hot pot was salty..... also got Omurice (egg covering rice) for take out, which is decent nth special. Overall disappointed but will give another shot."}
{"text":"Super-authentic, very good quality food, and quite low prices for some of the more complex dishes. Try the yakisoba or the takoyaki!

As noted by other reviewers, biggest downside is that they will be closed without any notice, usually only at lunchtime though. Some dishes are slow to prepare, but that is only a problem with respect to the size of the place, overall the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Located in the TnT Supermarket(Milliken) food court. Its kind of small like a mom and pops joint.  I always go for my Curry Pork Katsu on Rice dish.  Its really has a good taste and filling. I tried the Takoyaki but always taste the same like any other takoyaki joint.  I been too here fews times since it is near by.  Wait times are not the greatest but oh wells. Bought it for a complete of colleagues and they ask me where did I get it from.  All in All I would recommend it but go early I been there when it was sold out of katsu at 3pm..strange..ahh..Happy Eating~!!"}
