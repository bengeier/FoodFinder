{"text":"Food prices are okay but everything else was lacking for me. Everything was okay until after we order and the dishes started coming. We forgot that we had ordered a fried rice too so when we asked for white rice, we asked for too much. When the waitress brought it to the table, we explained the situation and apologized. She immediately rolled her eyes to the back of her head and walked away, not even letting us finish because we were going to keep 2-3 bowls out of the 5. Then when she brought up the steam fish, she jerked right next to the tablet and myself, spilling some of the streaming sauce to the ground but thankfully not onto me. Then she cursed loud enough for my whole table to hear her, walked to get napkins to clean up the spill and then walked away. No apology. 

Food was okay, but nothing special. So with this service performance, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I ordered plain congee for take out two days ago. It came up to just about $7. It was in 2 separate containers enough for two people. 
Today i ordered the same thing. When i came to pick it up, it was only one container and it was a smaller container as well. It was enough to feed a midget. 
We told the lady and she just replied with \"No. thats one order.\" 
Upon looking at their menu on yelp, i noticed that plain congee wasn't on their menu and the fancy a** congees were only $4.75 
I can't even describe how my green tea milkshake was. 
 There's a reason why this place is 3 stars..soon to be 2."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for cheap congee. Service is not that great, but hey... what can ya do. Dim sum is awesome, we had the siu mai and the har gow which was really good. DO NOT get the ginger beef lo mein... it taste some what cardboard with a hint of ginger."}
{"text":"For my first time at this location, I'd say my experience is Okay. I do agree with a few fellow yelpers in their points they've made about this restaurant. The place is clean and not dirty like how some pointed out. The servers do pretend not to see you possibly b/c they wanna do something else (like not work) haha. The menu choices here is HUGE!!! And there are lots of  booth to sit which is great for couples. While the food here may not be as great as a 'Congee Queen', its still Okay.

I ordered the 'Turnip Patties Singapore Style'. ($5.5). The size is reasonable and it is cooked fine, but there is definitely lack of seasoning.

Also ordered their 'Oyster Patties Chiu Chow Style'. ($6.5) Its shape and cut like a mini pizza size. The patty was cooked very tender, so this dish is fine.

Last dish ordered was their 'Thai Fried Rice w/ Soft Shell Crab'. ($8.75) Now the portion on this dish is HUGE. Enough to feed at least 3-4 ppl. The rice is cooked well with no clumps on rice, and generous portion of soft shell crab. Now it did lack seasoning on this dish as well, but I guess its better not salty and just add your own, instead of the dish being salty and there is no saving it.

Final bill with one drink: $25 before tips. I do believe I would come back here to dine if I am hungry for somewhere close by."}
{"text":"It's 3.5

Great place if you go for their pick your own \"wor choi\".  Wor choi for 3 is $25.99: comes with soup, 3 dishes(pick your own), and rice. 

Highly recommend their Gui Fei chicken, pork neck with celery, satay beef with vermicelli in hotpot, salt and pepper pork chop, and salt and pepper squid.

Also, their hot milk tea and red bean ice drink with ice cream are among the best in the GTA(not joking!)

Their congee is nothing special but go for their wor choi and drinks for sure!"}
{"text":"Portions are large and the food is decent. I don't have anything bad to say about this place for my first experience. Very good."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Gets a little busy during weekends at dinner but the turnover is pretty fast.  Service and food are excellent.  Cantonese chow mein, yang chow fried rice and crispy chicken are the usual favorites and they don't disappoint.  Hot and sour soup and seafood congee also quite tasty.  Only drawback is if you have a large group and they sit you on the left side away from the servers.  The service drops off so order everything at once and do it early.  Parking across the restaurant are plentiful but always 3/4 full at night.  Located in Woodside Mall. Been back multiple times."}
{"text":"Just opened 6 mths. Now.  Note: local on McCowan Rd., even though address is Sandhurst Cr.  
   Wonderfully decorated, dark wood tones, Stainless steel or chrome.  Some dishes very tasty but pricey.  They get busy esp. Nights and/later.  Wonder why orientals eat so late and where they put all that food!  Washrooms are super clean and quite roomy.  Wheelchair access.  In my Neck of Wds, so repeat patron satisfied."}
{"text":"At first when I pass by this restaurant, I was excited to find another restaurant similar to Congee Queen/Wong. They serve big portions for a low price. Looks fairly neat and big when walked in. However, the food is tasteless, I never walked out a restaurant before with food left on table and hungry still. Food needs big improvement. Such disappointment. Not returning."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new and I actually like it. I like the fact that I now have a place to go to with food the same TASTE as Congee Queen or Congee King or whatever other congee whatever the f--- you call them places that serves what I think is Chinese food. 

Comparing this however to Congee Queen would be a sacrilage only because of the fact that Congee Town is way more budget friendly. My parents love this place so much that they practically ordered food from here for take out 4 nights in a row last week and I think they still eat there at least twice a week.

It's good, I love it. But I gotta stop eating there once a week. I'm getting sick of it. But its gooooood."}
{"text":"I went with my friends for lunch. It was crowded with people during the time because it was 1pm on a Sunday. We waited for almost 15 minutes to get a seat.

We got the jumbo-sized seafood congee. There were hokkigai in the congee that were enough for exactly three people, because there were exactly three pieces of it. There were, however, an abundant amount of salmon, but I'm not really a salmon guy. To my surprise, even shrimp were lacking in the congee. Gladly there were many chunks of white fish inside. 

We also got XO sauce beef chow mein and it was decent. 

The shrimp dumpling lo mein we got was alright although I would rather just order a plate of shrimp dumplings."}
{"text":"Went today and awful service... No servers available to take or order and all of then telling us to wait and they will be with us in a minute but it took 10 mins to order.  Food came anda big chunk of beef in the dish wad completely raw in the middle oozing blood.  I told the server she wad like do what do you want? I'm like hello it's raw thats unacceptable and she said oh the meat wad folded in half that's why it didn't get cooked.  I don't care if it was folded in half or not the bottom line is that it should not have been raw in the first place and there should have been some quality control there cuz it's not my job as a guest to find the raw parts in the food and pick them out.  I would not eat here ever again the server did not offer to take the raw dish off my bill she just ordered to have it stirred on the wok after i told her the raw juices touched all over the dish.  The food was bland and the portions were small."}
{"text":"Food is not fresh. I ordered congee that was tasteless and thick. Their BBQ was awful, I ordered steamed chicken with BBQ duck and got bones and fat pieces which included a neck piece. I felt like I paid 9$ for a plate of white rice and sauce and scrape pieces of BBQ. Awful"}
{"text":"Wrost restaurant ever, bad customer food, and most importantly the food is awful. The price is high, the tea is awful. They can't even cook the congee right, I mean is a congee town right, they should know how to cook congee. Anyhow, I give them one star is the best I can but what I have in mind they don't deserve any star"}
{"text":"Went with the family for a quiet dinner.  We paid $116 cash on a $104 bill (about 11% tip).  When you pay the bill, the server usually serves everyone a bowl of dessert.  Now a 10% at a chinese restaurant is common, especially considering how the servers here NEVER ask how your food is, NEVER  ask if you need anything, try to ignore you as long as they can pretend they don't see you, which all is fine, but that kind of service really doesn't deserve more than a 10% tip.  This time, the server took a look at the bill, picked it up and told us to serve the dessert ourselves.  We enjoyed our dessert without a second thought when another server brought the cash back, but in the amount of $114 ($2 less than what we paid).  Perplexed, we went to the counter to ask what the deal was.  They said our tip was too small.  After a heated discussion, it turned out, the server mistook the bill amount.  Ok, fair mistake.  

But that kind of attitude was certainly unacceptable.  The idea behind a gratuity is to reward good service.  This restaurant was not one of even one mediocre service standards.  This kind of service was not even deserving of a tip.  If there was a problem with the bill, then they should come back and inform us of the issue.  not return our cash without word (minus $2) as a form of insult.  

The quality of service here also varies depending on how white your table is.  My family is probably very obviously of mandarin descent.  Occasionally, we may bring white friends to this restaurant for convenience.  THERE IS A VERY CLEAR WORLD OF DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU HAVE A WHITE PERSON SITTING AT YOUR TABLE.  they treat you like kings, make sure you're served and bring you extra napkins.  

We used to love this place, but it has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"Very good food quality for the affordable price. We had five people and spent about $70 before tip. We ordered a seafood set, 1 soup, 3 dishes and 1 dessert. It was my first time there and the taste was much better than I expected. Service was good, too. They responded to us very quickly, but some people think they have bad service, i think because there are a lot of customers and they get too busy... but the lady serving us dessert was really quick changing our plates and splitting the dessert..."}
{"text":"Chicken and duck congee was very good. Grilled lo bok go was alright. Noodle with tendon was good. Waited half an hour for the chicken and Chinese sausage hot pot, but it came undercooked, so we sent it back to the kitchen. After waiting another 20 minutes, we could wait no longer and decided to leave. Asked the cashier to take the hot pot off the bill, but had to argue with her for a few minutes before she would do so.

Was able to connect to their WiFi, but was not able to connect to any websites with it."}
{"text":"I came here with my grandma for dinner and ordered the black bean sauce rice noodles with chicken (I think it's something like that in English). We told them to make it with extra sauce and they said ok. When our food arrived, it was apparent that it's not made with extra sauce. We flagged down a waiter and said that they made our food wrong. We've come here before and they made it with extra sauce every time. However this time, not only did they not remedy the problem, the waiter was very rude. \"That's not extra sauce to you?\" Lmao bitch hell no it's not! Of course I didn't say that to him though. He said that its extra sauce and we said it's not and asked if he could do something about it. He muttered something under his breath and then said no and walked away. Ok..... So we dealt with it. 


I later asked a waitress for a hot ovaltine. She completely forgot about my order and I had to ask once again. The ovaltine was very watery. Very little ovaltine taste. And it wasn't even hot! It was luke warm. 

I'm writing this review as I wait for my bill and I've been waiting for about 5 minutes already. 
Update: I waited an extra 7ish minutes for my change. Wasn't even busy tonight.
Some reviews here say that this place is comparable to Congee Queen and I highly disagree! Congee queen food actually tastes good and their waiters aren't rude. 

** TLDR - service sucks, rude waiter, tolerable food but in no means good"}
{"text":"Made reservations for a large group of 20 people and I was impressed that they were able to accommodate us on short notice for lunch one Sunday. When we arrived on time and the tables were ready! The call button for service was a bonus. One table ordered the chicken fried rice, beef with soya sauce noodles, Cantonese chow mein,  Chinese broccoli, shrimp and chicken with mango, sweet and sour chicken, deep fried turnip, and salt and spice squid. Of all the dishes, only the beef and soya sauce noodles tasted off. Portions and price are reasonable. Ideal place if you want fast service, filling food, and are not picky."}
{"text":"FOOD: solid Chinese food, nothing special but nothing terrible either

AMBIENCE: typical Chinese fare, lots of tables and conversations

SERVICE: waiters and waitresses are intelligent and think quickly on their feet. Not always the most attentive, but they respond immediately

PRICE: fed a group of 12 for around $95, approximately $8 per person. 

TIPS: they take credit and MasterCard, and have good lunch/high noon options as well."}
{"text":"always consistent food is good, albeit i don't go for the congee, the others that i do go with do, and we always come back.  spicy tofu and deep fried pork cutlette are a few of my favourites."}
{"text":"Food is still good but the service leaves much to be desired (at least for the night time staff).  Rude cashier snapped when I asked for the late night snack menu. \"It's mine! Not for you\" is the exact English  translation. I realized afterwards that it was not time as of yet. She could have simply stated that without blowing a fuse.
Ordered 1 dish which they forgot to put into their system. 30 mins later, I just got up and left. Horrible service after 9pm. Go during the day. I won't be back for a long time"}
{"text":"**1/2 stars

Located in the mall at Sandhurst Circle right beside the Regal (which used to be the old Ruby Restaurant).

The restaurant itself is quite spacious and is setup similar to your standard congee and noodles places with booth seats along the wall and tables in the middle.

Ordered the Fish and Beef Congee, HK Style Street Rice Noodle Roll (steamed plain rice noodles with a hoisin-peanut sauce, sprinkled with sesame seeds) and Shrimp and Egg Rice Noodles.

The congee was not properly seasoned (e.g. Lacking in salt) but was easily remedied with a dash of soy sauce.  The fish was quite tender while I found the beef to be a bit on the chewy side.

The HK Style Street Rice Noodle Roll was not thoroughly steamed as the edges of the rice noodles were still hard.

The Shrimp amd Egg Rice Noodles were standard - nothing exciting.

Service was lacking although the dishes came out pretty quickly. There are definitely better congee and noodle places in town!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, yesterday.  We arrived at 12.40pm and there was a wait for a table.  The restaurant is quite large but they have too many large tables(for 10 people) and not enough tables for 4 or less people.  We waited around 10 minutes and were seated.  As it was our first time here, we took our time studying the menu and deciding on what to order.  

We ordered a ginger and spring onion lo mein, preserved veg and minced beef congee, home style vermicelli, bbq pork steamed rice rolls and a veg in soup rice noodle.  The food overall was ok, however,  I wouldn't order the rice rolls again.  The bbq pork wasn't very fresh, I understand it's the leftovers but it was a good 2/3 days old, if not more.  The rice roll itself was small, thin and not very good.  The best dish was the congee, the consistency was a tad too thick but they used proper minced beef and not just chopped up beef slices, that everybody else gives.(including Congee Queen).  I hate it when people offer minced beef and they don't have it and just chop up beef slices for you, it ain't the same.  

Service however, left a lot to be desired, ie there is no service really.  The 3/4 staff were overwhelmed and were trying to do their best.  We asked for the bill twice and finally got it, after 10 minutes.  Then I decided to go up to the counter to pay because God knows when I would have gotten my change.  They really need a few more staff members to cope.  

Overall, the food isn't bad, not superb.  I would come back again, my kids liked it."}
{"text":"Congee Town is a great place for some classic Cantonese cuisine. It is a great alternative to one of my favourite restaurants in Chinatown, House of Gourmet.  The decor is vibrant with a nice elegant touch. The service is decent. If you want to have a nice meal, be sure to arrive early or make a reservation since this place is very popular among the locals in the area , especially during peak lunch and dinner hours. 

There are a lot of menu choices to choose from ranging from Congee to Rice Dishes to Noodle Dishes to Barbecue Dishes to Stir Fried Dishes, there are many options. 
I would definitely recommend trying the congee since the portion is very reasonable for a good price. But, if you want something special, I would try the Singapore Style Stir Fried Turnip Patties . In my opinion, this is the most popular dish that is ordered in this restaurant.  The rest of the menu options are fairly decent, pretty simple and classic, you can not go wrong in your menu choice. Also, there is afternoon tea special with very good prices. 

So, if you want a nice meal to enjoy with the family, Congee Town is the place to be."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and have been extremely satisfied every time.  Only once, when I ordered Chinese brocoli and you could tell it was not as fresh, but otherwise have always been very pleased.  It is clean, the food has great flavour, the menu has a great variety, the service is friendly and quick.

I am in an interracial relationship and my husbands family are Chinese.  Chinese parents (old school) can be hard to please when it comes to new Chinese restaurants, gotta be cheap and good, and they loved it!  I was happy to be able to impress!!

Thank you, we are ordering take-out tonight, look forward to it!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, solid portion size, comfortable seating, very reasonable prices, variety of options and decent quality round out a great experience.
What I Got: roast pork with rice
What I Wouldn't: Hainanese chicken
What I'll Get Next: I was eyeing the minced beef fried rice. Tons on the menu.

This may have just supplanted Kenny's as my group go-to spot. Swung by Sunday around 230 pm, and we took a look at the late afternoon tea specials.

Simple decor is backed by comfortable seats and really friendly service. Since I was the only one of my group not to get something off the special list, the server decided to get me a pot of soup on the house.

Plus, they supplies tons of water quickly and without hassle.

The food itself? Large but not overwhelming portion size. 

Roast pork rice was very tasty. Good mix of lean and fat parts, with some veggies thrown into the mix. Could've used a bit more sauce, but it's pretty standard. 

Hainanese chicken does not use the traditional chicken oil rice - seems a bit off (friend suggested it was more like fried rice). Chicken itself had bone in and didn't look special.

But I guess that's the point. This place isn't special in terms of quality. Decent but not spectacular. Your typical 3 star level. Where it excels is everything else: service, portion size, pricing.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Hot, flavorful and fresh every time. Haven't been disappointed yet for dinner. In the summer they do a house dessert that has coconut milk, grass jelly, tapioca, red  bean and Mung bean..... Have no idea what it's called but it's served cold and it's so good. Service is very quick and actually kind of pleasant considering customer service isn't really a priority at Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Congee town is a solid place for Cantonese food. I don't think I ever had a bad experience and the food is exactly what you expect from these kind of places. Decent food, portions, and reasonable prices

What I like about this place is that it's definitely more roomy and spacious than other similar places and they had huge flat screen TVs showing sports (who would have thought would be watching baseball at a place like this). 

We went with a seafood combo and everything was decent. The seafood fried rice was good and actually had decent amount of seafood in it. The lobster was your standard ginger garlic one but I felt it could have used more ginger and garlic. The deep fried chicken could have been more moist but then again, most places have dry chicken breast as well. They gave a lot of gai lan which you can never have enough. We ended the meal with some good tong sui. 

There was a lot of food and we all left super full. No problems with service but you can just tell how fast the waiters were working because it was busy."}
{"text":"All show, No go

This restaurant has potential. As you enter the establishment, you will notice the set up of tables is clean with decor that is welcoming. There was no wait on a Wednesday evening at 7:30pm. I had just spent the day bumbling around Toronto on a family trip and I was ready to get my grub on. 

My aunt and uncle took charge and ordered for our table of 8 to satisfy our hunger for food. The food arrived briskly and the portions were healthy. The problem was that the food looked good and plentiful, but it was lacking in flavor. The corn soup was sub par. The chicken fried rice with salted fish (one of my fave dishes) was flavorless. The dish of steamed fish was a bit overcooked and I felt like I had to douse each piece with soy sauce. The remainder of the dishes were alike. Do you see a trend here?

Aside from the sub par food, the service was ok. They were some what attentive and did at least bring our food out without having us wait a long time. 

The highlight of my meal was being able to spend more time with my family from Toronto. This restaurant is not a good representation of delectable chinese food."}
{"text":"Weekends and dinner time are packed. We tried lunch and yes it was busy but we were seated within a couple of minutes. Waitresses were super efficient and just the right degree of friendliness. We went with noodles all around and did not disappoint. Favourful, tasty and satisfying."}
{"text":"Nice place...had a huge lineup on family day but the food was pretty good. The waitress didn't even hand us menus, (we had to get them ourselves) but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because they were so busy. The congee was also quite slow to come and they served the deep fried bread wayyy too early (because youre supposed to dip those in congee)."}
{"text":"Congee town is one of the after hours meal places that I frequently go to with my family. The restaurant is usually open until midnight and offers rich comfort foods in the essence of congee, noodles and fried rice - the types of food Chinese people associate with \"siu yea ??\" or late night snack. 

Ambience: the lighting of this restaurant is very bright, typical of Chinese restaurants. What's atypical about this restaurant is the background music: abundant are the various pop and rap songs that you won't associate with Chinese restaurants. This makes the pairing a bit odd. Case in point, at some point Eminem was in the background. But it none the less doesn't affect the dining experience. 
3/5 stars

Service: the servers were in general very nice. The food was very promptly delivered. 
3/5 stars

Food: we ordered a variety of dishes to be shared. Of particular note is the abalone clam and chicken sliced congee. The congee rice was cooked to a very smooth texture that was a delight to taste. The abalone clams were very easy to chew, and added a rich seafood flavour to the congee.
3.5/5 stars

Price: decent price, reflective of the quality of the food served.

Health: I will elaborate more on the congee here. The congee that I got is a delightful treat to those whose stomach would get irritated easily otherwise. It's very easy to digest, and was not heavy in added flavours (although I do taste more salt on the congee here compared to home cooked congee)
3.5/5 stars

Overall, a delightful restaurant for the late night snacker or just regular dinners with the family to taste an authentic Hong Kong style Chinese cuisine. 

Overall rating: 3/5 stars"}
{"text":"ordered Hainanese chicken takeout
no chicken meat, nothing but bones. they even threw in a drumstick bone without the meat
I called to complain, they said that's the way they prepare the Hainanese chicken
but I believe they are recycling other customers' uneaten food
pretty bad.....avoid this place"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, but I came to this place two-days-in-a-row.
What makes this place really popular is the food selection, portions and price.
Weekends be weary as the wait times can be long.  Congee town is not ONLY known for its congee...well it is actually lol they have a great selection of congees at extremely.,,EXTREMELY reasonable price, I mean where else can you get a super-huge bowl of congee for under $9, nowhere. 
Aside from congee, this place has a wide selection of shareable dishes to choose from at a set price which is awesome.
The ambiance is clean with plenty of contemporary decor, however its all about the food and service which was up to my standards.  

I don't think it will take me lots of time to become DUKE of this place."}
{"text":"I've been to several Chinese restaurants (almost a resident at congee Wong) so I'm familiar with the service and quality of a typical family Chinese restaurant. With that being said, Congee Town is actually better than average in terms of quality of food and pretty friendly service!! Would definitely try to make it back here again soon.

Came here with a family of 15 and got the Prix fixe.so much food, but all your typical Chinese dishes, including my favourite: shrimp balls.

Shrimp balls here are not only fragrant, but actually crispy on the outside, not chewy and super soft on the inside. Love em'."}
{"text":"Congee Town is in my old neighbourhood and I've been there a few times. It's spacious and clean and the prices are very reasonable.

On this occasion, we kept it simple by ordering a corn and tofu congee, Singapore vermicelli, and stir fried chicken with Chinese broccoli (gai-lan).

The congee wasn't my choice but it had more flavour than I expected and I had a second bowl. I usually order one that has some kind of meat and/or egg. The vermicelli was good but I could have used just a pinch more curry flavour. The chicken was tasty and the gai-lan was cooked properly, tender but still had a little crunch.

There's a call button at the table and the response time was very quick and friendly. Overall, it was a good experience and I would return."}
{"text":"Went here with my family on Sunday.  I have asked them for their opinion and this is what they like: 1) not salty food 2) decent portion sizes 3) decent price
What they didn't like was the noise and crowd... and we had to wait a bit before sitting down.  Overall, they were shocked when I told them this place was rated as 3 stars.  They would like to give this place 5 stars to boost the rating.  Nevertheless, I liked the food and maybe most people would rather eat their meal dunked with salt and soy sauce, I liked how it was on the light side and not soo greasy."}
{"text":"This review is about a breakfast only.

Congee Town is a big restaurant.  There weren't a lot of customers in the morning we visited, so we got seated immediately.  The service level was reasonable.  I ordered a breakfast combo that consisted of a plain congee and a cheung fun.   The cheung fun was not very good, and the management made it up with portion.  The plain congee was quite decent.  The texture was a little thicker.  I like it this way, as the meal became more substantial.

In conclusion, congee was all right.  Not confident about other items."}
{"text":"Living in this area makes me a frequent here. They provides all kinds of Chinese food for very reasonable prices. Taste is good for this price range. Good customer service."}
{"text":"A very large restaurant for a place that serves congee. However, this is not the only thing they have here. The menu is massive. You can get dim sum, afternoon tea, breakfast type foods, Chinese BBQ and more. 

Chicken and abalone congee - I found the congee was a bit too thick. Tasted okay though, especially when accompanied with the deep fried dough sticks. (I have no idea what its called in English but deep fried dough sticks is the best description I can give :)

Rice rolls we ordered tasted okay as well but they did not taste like they were freshly made. Not as soft and silky smooth like they should be.

The egg yolk custard bun we ordered was also okay.

I think they have way too much to choose from on their menu. Food is decent but would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"This place is horrible... 

Starting with the food... I ordered fish congee for take out and got home and the fish was still raw and cold. the BBQ pork isn't yummy at all. The food quality I would give it a 1.5/5

They have the worse service... the waitress would pretend they don't see you and they are poorly trained. Rude and no manners. I gave them many chances as my family goes there cause we are close by... I would give their service 1/5

I will not return again as I have gave them many chances. One word that describes Congee Town : DISAPPOINTING."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a weekday. No line up, plenty of tables available.

Breakfast here is cheap!!  
Under $5 gets you a huge bowl of plain congee and a plate of rice rolls with some kind of meat. Congee is just average - not terrible, but not the best. The rice rolls are served in a bowl and topped with your choice of meat (brisket, ribs, char siu) and they were not good at all. 

For under $7, you can get a plate of fried noodles and a congee with your choice of filling. The noodles weren't the freshest, they looked like they were half leftover noodles and half freshly cooked noodles. 

Service here is good though! Efficient and friendly! 

Come here for the prices and not the taste."}
{"text":"I can tell by how good this place is by how packed it was. We had the turnip patties shrimp and scallop fried rice and shrimp Congee I like Congee queen better but this place definetly comes in second place. The ambiance is nice. The staff were very attentive and super friendly. The turnip was crispy and very moist inside. We also had an amazing dessert tapioca mago pudding which warm and very tasty I can eat that all day. This type of places will never disappoint me"}
{"text":"I admire the owner here. She had managed many similar restaurants and never ceases to be so energetic, responsive,  and responsible.  It does the her staff team which is of equally high calibre. Great selection of food.  Includes soup, fried dishes, noodles, rice, congee, vegetables, rice rolls and dimsum.  Clean place and family friendly decor. Good portions, good quality, good taste, and good price.  I also love it that the place opens late.  Great place to rewind with hot Chinese dishes after a long day of work."}
{"text":"There's a huge selection of food here from congee to dim sum to noodles. I love getting congee at restaurants because it taste better than homemade congee (probably because of the MSG). I got the chicken and duck congee this time around and it was decent. There was more bone than meat which I expected. My boyfriend got sweet and sour chicken, har gow, siu mai and fried turnip. The dim sum were $2.80 each which is on the expensive side. The fried turnip wasn't too oily which I prefer and they had some shrimps mixed in which was nice. Overall, the food here is good and you're bound to find something you'll like here."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit or miss for me when it comes to service but in terms of food, it has yet to disappoint (for me at least). It's a good place if you're craving cheap chinese food - they have daily deals! This time around, my friends and I ordered take-out; 9 items and everything came out to $57 with tax (suuuuuuper cheap). For their service, I would say they have some good and bad days... some just literally forget about you after serving your food. Some of them even tell us \"that's enough\" when ordering as if we don't want leftovers. Then there are days where they're attentive and more polite. I always enjoy their deep fried spicy pork chop, chow mein and dimsum!"}
{"text":"I cant say that the food here is terrible, because it is extremely cheap. You get huge portions as well. If you are on a budget and want Chinese food, this is the place to go.
Service is not great, feels congested inside. I'd rather pay more for better food."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese food. Prices are average. Usually come here if I'm in the area to grab a quick bite but nothing special. Food is more on the oily side in my opinion though."}
{"text":"My initial reaction when I entered the restaurant was that the interior is well kept. It had a good and well-maintained ambiance, but the food is ok. There's a lot of selection, which is what kept me from walking out the door.

FOOD: I usually don't have high-expectations for Cantonese cuisine, so I wasn't surprised that it tastes like all the other restaurants. We ordered the Sweet and Sour Pork Rice, Shredded Chicken & Duck w/ Egg Congee, and BBQ Pork Rice Noodle Roll. The amount we paid in relation to the quantity--superb. The quality of the food, mediocre."}
{"text":"This place is very good in terms of atmosphere, service and food. The fried rice is a must get!! (I suggest the Thai Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice or the Seafood Fried Rice w Shrimp - they are both very tasty for a price of ~$11). They're combos are very good, bc its inexpensive and it comes with a drink (I prefer HK Milk Tea Hot - just because its the originals and it actually taste somewhat like the ones in HongKong!!). There's one lady server which is very energetic and would serve you kindly like always be at your service, and would help you pack your takeout (most servers don't do that) Yay!!! However, do not get the Hainan Chicken Rice bc the chicken is very soft, don't get the french toast bc they don't really fry it that well. But other than that every thing is very good and the stir fry is quality & quantity for the given price, as Cantonese people say: the dish has \"wok hay\". Also, the congee is preeety delicious as well!! 

Hope this Helps!! :)"}
{"text":"The moment you walk in, you are welcomed by the overwhelming scent of bathroom deodorizer. Hoping to get used to this unusual smell in the dining area of the restaurant, we sit down.
We order our food. 
I go to the bathroom. Funny enough, it does not smell like bathroom deodorizer.
We had ordered one of the lunch specials. It came with a beverage. I chose coffee. They didn't ask what I wanted in it. It arrived with cream already in it. I told them I couldn't have cream. They insisted it wasn't cream (when you're allergic to it, you know it's cream), they brought it back black a few minutes later. No sugar. I gave up. 
We had the Hu Fun lunch special and the Cantonese Chow Mein (this is the dish I rate all Chinese restaurants with.) 
The Ho Fun with beef was very good, the Cantonese Chow Mein was average. 
Service overall was average, not fully attentive, but just enough to say it was good.
I don't think I'd have to return to the restaurant again. It is average, in this neighbourhood with so many other choices, I know I don't have this as an only option.
If you are wondering what happened to the bathroom deodorizer scent, it was faint by the end of the meal. However, I will always remember this as the \"Bathroom deodorizer scented restaurant\""}
{"text":"food quality was excellent for restaurant type.
Waitstaff could definitely give better service sometimes though.
Ate here twice last week.  
They didn't mind that we just had drinks and dessert the second time.  Good thing."}
{"text":"First family dinner of our vacation. Nine adults and three toddlers. We ordered a set dinner and added a dish. Because they didn't have the whole fish in stock, we opted to substitute in a couple of other fish dishes. 

Service was fantastic and the food was very good. They were right when they said we wouldn't be able to finish it all. Had our other brother joined us, we would have been fine. But alas, there was an abundant amount of leftovers. The last dish was Noodles and Dumplings in Soup. We had no room for it on the table and everyone was stuffed so we asked them to box it up for us. They were kind enough to place the noodles and dumplings in separate containers. Guess who had it for breakfast over the next two mornings? 

I'm not going to rate each dish individually here. There were so many and all of them were very good. The name of this restaurant, Congee Town, sells it short. They have much more than Congee here. We recommend coming here with a large group so you can order lots of food and enjoy many different flavors!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place as everything else was closed at 9AM.

The service here is somewhat slow as it was only 9AM and there were only 3 people in the restaurant, yet servers took anywhere about 3 minutes - 5 minutes to notice me from ordering to paying for my check.

I ordered the minced beef with preserved egg and it was somewhat odd tasting.  The beef and egg were fine but the outcome of the congee had a odd wooden taste?  The dough sticks came out WAAAAAY after I was already finished the congee (like literally when I asked for the cheque).  The chicken wings and fries were decent but a little expensive for only 4 chicken wings.

The table and silverware were somewhat sticky...

All in all, I'm only coming back if everything else is closed again and I actually venture out that early."}
{"text":"Only ordered Congee, but the price and quantity was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 10 after Case Deluz next door had a massive wait time. We were seated immediately and service was fast. They took our order very quickly and brought the food and tea pretty fast. The food portions are huge and the food isn't too bad. It's also nicely renovated inside. Overall, I liked my meal here and would come back."}
{"text":"This is your HK cafe experience in Toronto for lunch time. They also serve traditional Cantonese style dishes until late in the night. 

Decor: Pleasant, clean surrounding, spacious. 

This used to be my go to lunch spot. They've raised prices slightly... but all restaurants have, it is still very affordable with large portion sizes.

Recommended Dishes: Tomato pork chop baked rice, salmon congee (large bowls), Portuguese chicken baked rice."}
{"text":"2.5 star 

Sometimes I lost track of which Congee place I was eating at.. Since they are all named similarly King, Queen, Time, Wong.. and the newcomer to the Scarborough area is Congee Town.

The deco is clean and simple... and though the restaurant is big, the owner packed the table capacity to the max... the problem is on a busy Good Friday late lunch hour, they don't really have enough staffs to handle the crowd.

\"Take a number and wait\" which I don't really mind..but at least clean the tables and sit customers promptly. It was so annoying to see dirty empty tables left unattended while people anxiously waiting for their numbers to be call!

Lai Wan Style Congee ($3.95)
- good congee based..even the ingredients are quite interesting: roasted duck, pig skin, pork, squid...
- they did not put in any salt.. but you can always sprinkle some table salt to make it a little saltier..

Fried Turnip Patties ($5.25)
- The turnip was quite tasty, as they deep fried the diced patties so it is hot
- the shrimp and the chicken though are cold, though they were fully cooked but kind of gross me out a little

Fried Eggplant/Tofu ($3.75)
- freshly deep fried and the black bean sauce with a hint of spiciness giving them a kick, A- OK

Mince Beef Cilantro Rice Roll ($2.95)
- portion is a little small... the beef lack the Cilantro flavour and it was like paper thin... 

The food served quickly after we ordered that was a pleasant surprise since it was so busy. Wait services though really lacking, staffs really over worked and grumpy.

The tea cups and bowls are all chipped.. so be really careful when you sip your tea... for a place that is newly opened that should not be happening!

Maybe I might come back on another day to try out their noodles dishes.. but definitely not when I have to wait for a table! The food at Congee Town really doesn't worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and always enjoy the food here, which I think is comparable to Congee Queen (both the Kennedy/Sheppard location and the Don Mills one). I prefer the setup of this place however, (especially compared to the Kennedy CQ) since it is a lot brighter and a lot more spacious. It is usually pretty busy during lunch time on the weekends, and you'll likely have to wait, but at least there is sufficient seating and standing area around the front.

Usually if I come with my family we will get one large bowl of congee and then either a fried rice or noodle dish to share. The prices are very reasonable. Most recently we had a huge bowl of seafood congee which was $7.75 and fried vermicelli which was $6.95. They were doing a lunch special thing where you could get the noodles with a choice of soup of the day/milk tea/lemon tea/soy milk for like an extra $0.50, which I thought was a pretty good deal. I got the lemon tea and it was okay. Quality of the food is good, it doesn't taste overloaded with MSG or overly greasy or anything, so I am a fan. The seafood congee comes with a lot of seafood and really big chunks of salmon, so you do get your money's worth.

I would only give the place 3 stars though because the service was pretty bad. I went last Sunday for a late lunch (arrived around 1:30 PM) and the place wasn't even that full or busy. After our orders were taken and food arrived, no one came to check on us at all, and it was a struggle just to get someone to come and refill our teapot. It also took us a fair bit of time to flag someone down to get the bill. Not impressed.

Overall though, food is good, service is meh. This place is worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We had a late night dinner/snacks here after coming back late from a movie downtown. This place opens till midnight on most days which is a nice if you want a meal late at night.
The food quality was very average and portions are surprisingly small for chinese standard. We had a supreme seafood congee bowl to share; it was bland and the seafood was scant; the fish in the congee didnt taste very fresh. 
Turnip cake portion was very small and it was just okay. 
Cantonese chowmein was good, nice crispy noodles and good amount of meat. 
The restaurant was spacious and clean; service is adequate (chinese restaurant standard).
Overall, it was an okay place to have a bite if you're in the area. I however prefer congee queen.

Overall, it was an okay experience"}
{"text":"First off, this restaurant is super loud, maybe it was just the timing, but there were screaming kids that echoed from across the dinning area! I couldn't even hear myself talk...
I came here with my family on a Sunday evening,  it was super packed, but didn't need to wait. We ordered a set menu, and a side of sweet and sour pork (we order it at every restaurant to try it out). 
The dinner combo came with:
- fish belly soup - which was made with pork skin - not fish belly
- Chinese broccoli - lots of leaves attached to the stem
- Tilapia (fish) - decent, but lots of scales..
- half crispy chicken - pretty salty, and skin wasn't even crunchy - take out food does it better 
- seafood fried rice - very typical - comparable to take out food 
- one lobster - super small and stale tasting - the meat was mushy 
- sweet and sour pork - not crunchy, much comparable to take out food 
Our dinner also came with a dessert, it tasted great until..  we found a fish bone... 

Overall, the food is pretty comparable to Chinese take out places. I guess if you're looking for a decently priced place, this could be it! :P"}
