{"text":"The Samosa Factory always has great service and fantastic food. My order is ready on time and the food is consistently perfect."}
{"text":"These people take their food seriously! I called to preorder our samosas and requested a Sat 2:00 pick up time. My Hubs and I were just running around the city and were running behind our projected pick up time. You wouldn't think this was a big deal except I got a phone call at 2:15 asking where I was! lol! In the end we were about an hour late and our order was ready to go. There is a certain air of enjoyment when walking in and not having to wait like every other person in their packed store front. Pre-order people!   The samosas are delicious and there never seems to be enough of the dipping sauce so we always buy a couple more to be sure. We freeze our samosas and they come back in the oven/ toaster oven beautifully.  The location is awful. Period. It really couldn't get any worse. Oh wait, yes it can... There is ANOTHER Samosa place with a similar name just around the corner with huge signs which is misleading."}
{"text":"Check your orders before you leave. I recently ordered 3 dozen chicken samosas. When I got home, I found out that 2 dozen of the samosas were beef. I gave them a call back and lady on the phone was super apologetic. I returned back to the store and exchanged the beef samosas for chicken. I figured they couldn't screw up twice so I went back home without checking. Big mistake. Out of the 2 dozen new samosas, 50% of them were beef. I called back again, the lady on the phone was super embarrassed so she offered me 3 dozen chicken samosas on the house. She said that she would add that note to my account so I could pick them up the next day.   The next day I called back and spoke to a man. I'm not too sure what his position is but he was really confrontational. I told him my situation and even before I finished speaking he said that he would not give me what was promised. He said that the lady I spoke to was misinformed. I would of brushed the whole thing off but the guy acted like such an ass about the entire thing. Too bad. I won't be going back. I can't support a business that doesn't value it's customers. Seems like all he was worried about is saving a few bucks."}
{"text":"Had the vegetable and chicken samosas. Could use less salt in both the fillings but good all the same."}
{"text":"They are not samosas, just fried ravioli ! I wrote to the owner because we were very dissatisfied, no answer. We visited India many times, and have eaten in dozens of Indian restaurants in UK , Toronto and USA. Nowhere they tried to pass us a ravioli for samosas, with their special pastry folded the right times. It looks that nobody knows true Indian food and snacks"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Took about 15 mins for them to make up my order at lunch time. Next time I would call ahead. Had the veggie & beef. Not greasy at all. Wonderfully spiced. Did not get soggy on the 2 hr drive. Will get more the first chance I get."}
{"text":"Ordered half beef and half veggie samosas - the filling was delicious and flavourful, not as good as mom's, but pretty close! The dipping sauce that came with was delicious as well. Placed an order earlier in the day for 6:30, waited 20 mins past for pickup so keep that in mind when ordering. Will definitely try them again!"}
{"text":"**POST SHUTDOWN REVIEW** The samosa's are better than ever! Bought medium sized veg and beef samosas. Both were wonderful and very tasty. I devoured them in a single seating #NoRegrets.   What took me by surprise was the balance of the spices. It was not spicy, and the flavors were not overpowering. All this with a perfectly crisp exterior that was not too soft and not too brittle. A very pleasant surprise as I have found some restaurants using spice as a substitute for flavor.   The prices are reasonable! And they can manage large or small orders. Would definitely recommend visiting to fix that craving! Enjoy.   -keep in mind order before hand if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Samosa Factory is the perfect place to go if you're in need of a crowd pleasing party dish. There's always a box of their crunchy, delicious samosas at our company pot lucks.   I like to think of samosas as the ninja stars of the hor d'oeuvres world: pretty and easy to hold, but deathly delicious. The factory is tucked away in a strip mall in the middle of Castleridge and there's always a line up of customers. You can get ready-to-eat, deep fried samosas, or frozen ones you can bake at home. We always go for the 40 pack of veggie for $12, which is an insanely good deal!  In addition to samosas, the factory also makes pakoras and traditional Indian desserts. I've yet to try the desserts but they looked really good.   I love finding hidden gems and Samosa Factory definitely counts as one. Forget the pre-packaged party trays at your nearest grocery store. You'll be the hit of the party with these tasty puppies! Mmmm......"}
{"text":"This place is tiny and very busy.  No seating. Pickup only. Good idea to call ahead if you can. They're also not very organized which is odd considering the volume of orders they were filling. I ordered 20 medium peas n potato samosas and 6 beef. You cannot order individual pieces here, only sets of 6 or more.    The beef was tender and flavourful and the samosa skin was light. I chose to defrost them in the microwave prior to placing them in a 400F oven to finish crisping up. You can buy minis, medium or large size samosas and they also offer chicken filled ones too.   Not the best samosas I've ever had but I still rate them a 4 based on taste and product quality. They are great to have on hand in order he freezer for a quick appie or a light dinner."}
{"text":"Oh yea, these snacks bring up some fond nostalgic memories. I felt like I was 5 years old again eating Momma's freshly fried batch of samosa's.  The medium-sized pastries were perfectly sized with the proper dough to potatoe ratio (really separates the samosa-posers from the real deal). The chickpeas and fresh chutney were tastey compliments to the savory snack.  Keep that production line rolling, I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Samosa Factory, my family frequents this place like crazy!   It's strictly a take-out place, I haven't had any issues with ordering or delays in picking up. They are always prompt and the food is always ON POINT!  The veggie samosa is divine and you must get the chutney, I actually don't know what it's called but the orange one and green one (mint, I think) are amazing!   I would definitely recommend you order your samosas from here or if you need a potluck idea, this is the place."}
{"text":"Great mini veg samosas perfect for parties, bridal showers, events it's amazing and always fresh. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for take out, the mouse poop is free and yummy. Read the news!  This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"Awesome to go to for one of those days you don't want to cook and just need something to hit the spot. I like you can order half boxes for just two or a couple boxes can feed a small army. I usually go for the vegetarian but the spinich and paneer is s nice change too.  The meat lovers in my family love the beef and chicken."}
