{"text":"Love this pizza!  Very close to the style back home in jersey!  People are cool, too!"}
{"text":"I think Ray's offers the best pizza in N Scottsdale.  It's still not the perfect, floppy, gooey New York style pizza, but close as you're going to get.  I do think they are a bit pricey for what they offer, but it's never been bad. The atmosphere is not fancy, just a super casual, order at the register pizza joint.  My favorite is their monster with all the toppings, substituting Jalapeno's for the green peppers to give it a bit of kick."}
{"text":"I love Rays Pizza!  I'm a Jersey girl that loves plain cheese pies and Rays is the closest pizza to those I enjoyed growing up in New Jersey. Crust perfect and the cheese and sauce too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I exercise just so I can keep eating here!!! Great people and prices."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Ray's! I love the marinated mushrooms and bell peppers. The pizza crust is actually crusty on the edge, and tomato, not sugar, is the standout ingredient in the pizza sauce.  I've eaten here many times and appreciate the constent quality that goes into the food!   It's worth noting that Ray's Pizza in the Phoenix valley started is a family owned chain, with some restaurants  individually owned and operated. Unfortunately, all Ray's Pizzas are not alike.  The CaveCreek Ray's Pizza off 48th St is by far my favorite. Well worth the drive from Anthem!"}
{"text":"On Christmas Eve they were the only place open late! Which was such a life saver!! Being from Bronx New York myself it was like a taste of home!!!! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"I had the $6 Slice/Salad/Drink special and I left completely satisfied. Nice people, too. I used to live in NY and the pizza was just as good right here."}
{"text":"Staff is always nice and their pizza is awesome! The wings are good too! And so many other things! Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this rays for years with many family members and friends. We love coming here and have become regulars and are recognized by the friendly individuals whom work here each time we walk through the doors. They are extremely hard working and have always given our family a great experience each time we come in. The pizza is great as well as the subs and one of our favorites, the antipasto salad. We have made it a tradition to come eat here after every lake trip over the summer. I recommend this rays over all the others in the area. We love it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this pizza place for a number of years and it's pretty much the most well run pizza place around. Awesome people, family owned, and nice atmosphere. I usually get a few slices for myself but sometimes I like to get their spaghetti. Pretty much anything you order will be amazing. And make sure to grab a beer and a friend, it will make it even better!"}
{"text":"Rude owner. Will not be returning based on this alone. He should probably learn some customer service skills if he wants to keep his business afloat."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings are great!!!!  My family and I love Rays pizza.  It's our favorite pizza place.  It's always clean.  The prices are great.  The staff is wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"I wish they use fresh mushroom instead of can. We ordered half cheese and half monster but  the monster was loaded up and it made the bottom of the pizza soggy. Then the other pizza was sausage and mushroom (can) and pepperoni. That pizza was good but would have have be awesome with fresh mushrooms. I like the crust on the pizza it was crispy.  The guys at counter was nice and we didn't have any problems  like other yelpers."}
{"text":"The sauce and cheese were good on the pizza....however the dough needs work...it needs to be thinner and cooked more.If Rays upgrades to better flour for the dough they might have a NY pizza....."}
{"text":"Been going for 6 years  and great pizza just like my  previous home on Long Island. Service and atmosphere stink."}
{"text":"Ray's pizza is amazing! Great service and even better pizza. They treat their customers  with the upmost respect. Of course the white pizza is my favorite part about this place and the cheesecake too.   A slice of heaven!!!"}
{"text":"I had a manicotti plate w/ an Italian salad and toast to top it off- it was a truly delightful meal... Definitely well worth the drive.. Food is delicious, like always- must run in the family. Not only that, the staff was very accommodating and  helpful.  Would recommend 100%."}
{"text":"SOOOOOO miss our Ray's Pizza.  Ray's Pizza don't you want to open up a pizza place in Oregon?  You will make a killing here!  http://www.salvagesisterandmister.com/pizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzza/"}
{"text":"I typically liked the food for take out.  This time I ate inside and found the booth seats were nasty, table dirty, ice cube maker and tea machine smelled moldy gross.  I stood at the counter to request a fork for like 5 minutes before I was acknowledged after the food was delivered to the table.  My food was just dropped onto a silver platter without even using a paper plate as a liner.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't think I have had a bad experience at any of the Ray's in the North Valley.  As we have moved, there has always been one nearby.  The staff are always friendly and the food is always good!  If you can eat pizza without a napkin, it's not pizza!  It should be juicy, flopy and messy-with cheese that tastes like cheese and fresh veggies.  My wife grew up in Queens and Long Island- this is NY Pizza!  Thanks Rays!"}
{"text":"Awesome as usual!  We have moved a couple times over the last 10 years, and just recently moved near this Ray's location. All the other Ray's we were near rocked- and this one is no different. The cheese tastes better than anyone else's and the sauce is laid perfect- not too much but not too little. Glad we found one close again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely addicted! We have now began making this our weekly lunch stop (sometimes 3/4 times a week shh) I always get a calzone. I had the pizza and salad the first time and really enjoyed it! But the calzone is my love I get the plain calzone cheese, sauce, and I add only one ingredient PINEAPPLE! LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Everytime we walked in i pick up and menu set it down and get my regular. Pretty bad when the gal at the counter knows my order :) We have yet to be let down by this place! Our whole work is addicted, I cant wait til we move closer, but my pants im sure can wait! ;)"}
{"text":"Loyal customer from the East Coast for years. Excellent food. Pizza is always awesome."}
{"text":"I'll go here if I want the wing and pizza special.  Big, greasy, cheesy slices.  Interior is a little drab, not very warm.  I like to think that Ray is actually making my pie."}
{"text":"We found Ray's Pizza on Yelp during vacation in Scottsdale. If you're looking for an authentic NY style pizza, theirs is the real deal. Excellent sauce, good cheese, good crust, perfect taste for a NY/NJ pizza snob. We ordered a whole pie and it was prepared quickly. The staff was friendly and it was great to find a little taste of home out in AZ! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER  every time we try somewhere other then rays we regret it their pizza is the best in the area the only thing we would change is the hot sauce on the wings the flavor is great but the hottest they have tastes like a mild sauce other then that  RAYS IS OUR FAVORITE PIZZA"}
{"text":"Best pizza within 2,000 miles. I've had pizza in NY hundreds of times and this place is the best i've had outside the NY metro area. They've managed to do thin crust, yet don't skimp on the cheese. And the mozzarella is high-quality and melts in your mouth  - not the consistency of rubber. Sauce is great too. Please open a SE valley location!"}
{"text":"I love the experience everytime!! :-) I always feel welcome! I am big on customer service and it feels like family when I walk in!  I love all the food!! My personal favorite is the salad, pizza, and wings! Even the lasagna! Lol everything is delicious! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I understand why the place is always empty because the food sucks. The manager is rude everytime I go and the food takes for ever to make. I been there 3 times and I always leave pissed off. (I go to rays at last minute because Joeys next door always busy) I will never go back to rays."}
{"text":"This is a Sunday standby or always good for watching the game!  Normally, I am decidedly vegetarian when it comes to pizza, but the sausage pizza from Ray's is out of this world."}
{"text":"This pizza is absolutely great!!! My husband and I stopped by on Sunday, and I found myself there again today! The sausage and pepperoni slice (or pepperoni and sausage) was a great taste and a bargain( $3.12). The dough is thin, the toppings are plentiful, and the taste will have you wanting to eat pizza for days!!!!"}
{"text":"We lived in Surprise 6 years ago and would frequent Rays Pizza on Grand regularly. The price was fair and the pizza similar to what I experienced when I worked in NYC. I remember they spun and  threw their dough up in the air. Awesome.  We moved back to Surprise this summer (2016). In November, we ordered a pepperoni pizza and wings from Rays on Grand. Unfortunately, the pizza changed dramatically and tasted like something purchased from Costco or Sam's Club. The dough, which I believe is the heart of a pizza pie, had turned from a thinner crust to a cheese and tomato sauce on a piece of bread.  After eating a slice, I called Rays on Grand and spoke with the manager about the pie. I mentioned the dough is nothing like it used to be. Too much bread and not enough taste. The manager on duty stated nothing has changed in their recipe/process, but it was not the same. I said it was their business and this only a suggestion from a previous lover of Rays Pizza on Grand.  Will be looking for a new Go To pizza parlor in Surprise."}
{"text":"The customer service at this place is outstanding!  You feel like a long lost friend when you walk in the door.  Food is great also."}
{"text":"The thick crust pizza here is fantastic! Sicilian pizza is eat you want. The thin crust is about average.   Is the thin \"real ny pizza\"? No. Its good though for AZ. But the sicilian is stellar!   Good Cannoli as well."}
{"text":"Ordered one each;  large pepperoni, hawaiina and meat lovers along with cheese sticks and bread sticks.  They said 12 minutes until ready for pick up which seemed too short a time frame.  Well, that's because the pizza was not done in the center!  The bread sticks were dry; what happened to Ray's Pizza??"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have been going to this Ray's for over two years now.  The food is always great, wings are crispy and awesome.  I really like the pizza, the dough is chewy, crust is crispy, and toppings are really fresh/tastey.  We go there so many times the lady behind the counter (she's always there) already knows what we're gonna order as we walk through the door.  The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that the place can get really \"mucky\" feeling in the summer time, kinda like they're using a swamp cooler, makes it a little uncomfortable while dining in.  But none the less, we keep going back because of the food, service and location."}
{"text":"I'm a born New Yorker & I approve!!! Great taste, great service. I will come back again!!!!!!! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely impressive! I wish I had more stars to choose a higher rating. To begin, the pizza is definitely great (not sure about other menu items because all I ever got here is pizza) and to top it off, the customer service is better than any single restaurant...yes... restaurant (not just pizza) that I have ever frequented. Each time I am here, it doest change. Same great service and comfortable atmosphere! Prices are competitive. Good beer selection in addition. I can't find one thing I would change. Bathrooms are clean, as is the overall restaurant. Tables don't remain dirty for longer than 2 minutes after customer leaves."}
{"text":"The regular pizza is quite nice for when you're dining in, but the greatest thing is how well the Sicilian re-bakes.  Buy one, take it home for later, 15 minutes in the oven on a pizza tray and greatness follows. I think it's probably better that way than fresh (sounds counterintuitive, but the firmer crust is great, and the rest seems to hold all its flavor, even after being in the fridge). It's also a huge pizza (the Sicilian) for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Always friendly. Smile and greet everyone! Pizza is good Husband loves the wings the steak special sandwich is big enough to share. We love coming here."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! I enjoy the pizza a lot. I like how crispy the bottom crust is. As long as things don't change you can expect to see me back time after time!"}
{"text":"I won't get too verbose about the food. I will merely say this: it's the best pizza I've ever eaten, period. I don't know what makes it different from the other New York-style pizza-by-the-slice joints around town, but it's head and shoulders above anything I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"Sooooo I was leaving work one day, called the place I wanted to eat at and they weren't picking up the phone, 59th is near my house so I hit up yelp and saw rays pizza, I was a vegan(keyword WAS) but to please my woman I figured I'll surprise her with pizza, safe to say I'm not vegan anymore(vegetarian now lol). Rays is addicting like no other. Jalapeno and garlic slice well done is divine, only thing that is compareable is the art of making children."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch special great value! Lots of toppings no skimping here good service delicious food!"}
{"text":"Great pizza great prices and service always good service great food. I highly recommend rays pizza"}
{"text":"We had an hour to kill between my boys baseball games and found this place on yelp.  Food was very good and fast.  Friendly service.  We even had some extra time to kill so we watched football on one of five tv's."}
{"text":"Called 5 after 11 and they wouldn't take an order for pick up. The guy who answered said \"no, we close in 5 min\". Clearly their hours were until 11:30. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This pizza is not really good. It was super greasy and the cheese tasted funny! I was told this place was the place to go for good pizza in Scottsdale but obviously they were mistaken. At least the staff were nice."}
{"text":"Best sausage pizza in the area.  They slice flavorful sausage and do not dump on the sad deer turds that the other guys use. Super friendly staff.  Everyone here has always been really nice to me.  I live near 75th and Cactus and there are four pizza place right by my house but will always drive here."}
{"text":"Ray's makes a good pie, no doubt. The problem I have with this place is not the food. It's with the environment. The counter help appears to me to really want to be somewhere else. The guy that makes the pizza, who I think has been there since the dawn of time, is not real friendly and kinda grumpy. He doesn't handle complaints real well. He is the type of person who thinks that the customer is always wrong.  The other major issue is that they have a flat screen TV hanging above the entrance. The counter is about 25 feet away. The staff feels that is super critical that they not only see the incessant sports that is always on, but that they can hear it as well. This means that the overly loud TV is constantly blaring. It is so loud that you can barely hear yourself think. It escapes me as to why the management feels that this is OK to do. This is not your personal living room. It is a place of business.  The bottom line is this: The food is good, not as good as some here who seem to be doing cartwheels and think that the more exclamation points they use, the more weight their review carries. The problem with those overly enthusiastic reviews is that they often appear in the middle of 10 bad or so-so reviews. And to me, that is suspect. It's like someone from the restaurant itself posted the \"review\".   The atmosphere, however, is another story. It is far too much effort to try and block out the blaring sports nonsense that is always screaming from the TV. it may be time for Ray's to wise up and understand that this is a place of business, and not their personal entertainment space. After having been there a few times, and having always been quite bothered by the overly loud, blaring TV, I don't think they will."}
{"text":"Finally a good steak and cheese great meat not  to greasy not to salty they put  marinara sauce on it so if you like it traditional don't forget  ask for no sauce. My wife gets chicken fingers and she loves them. I'm not a huge fan of the pizza bit it's great value. It's great that you can grab a slice and a drink for cheap and fast. The buffalo wings are really small like the picture shows but cheap and tasty. Very very fast and friendly and great place to bring kids. No delivery but they have your order ready fast..."}
{"text":"Services is horrible. Never welcoming when you walk in. Wings and pizza were not fresh what so ever."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful staff, been going here for 30 years! Love it! If you want yummy pasta and pizza, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"No no. Just don't. There are other places to eat in the complex.  The food is super low quality and the service is shit."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and wings from here,, pizza was okay. The wings had good taste but were the smallest wings I've ever seen in my life. They were about an inch long. I can't believe I paid that much for that size of a wing. I will never waste my money again buying wings from this place. ATL wings or red devil have much better size wings. It's not a bad place just not worth the price you pay."}
{"text":"I LOVE Rays Pizza. I drive for 20 minutes just to get THEIR pizza.  It is delicious. They pack on the cheese and toppings, even though we usually pick up the pizza, we love to leave a gratuity.  I hope they never change the way the make their pizza.  This is where I always buy my pizza and take relatives when they come to visit.  Thanks Guys:):):):)  You ARE The Best!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for respectable New York-style pizza by the slice, Ray's is worth a visit.  If you're only interested in taking down a whole pie, don't fret because you can get that here too.  I have had their cheese slices, sausage slices, mushroom slices, and Sicilian pieces on many occasions.  All of these are good options, especially if you are looking to taste a vestige of New York cuisine."}
{"text":"I think Ray's has very good pizza as far as Ny style pizza goes. I'm surprised that the reviews are so inconsistent. I think when you compare pizza from different restaurants, you have to compare cheese to cheese. Forget the meats, etc.  .  Pizza should be judged on just the crust, sauce, and cheese. Ray's makes a great slice. Crust is perfect. Crispness on bottom and I can still  do the NY foldover.  I'd recommend this place for a traditional slice. Note: It's always been very clean when I'm there and I like that there's plenty of seating.  My kids enjoy the sports channels."}
{"text":"EAT AT RAYS    Ok,  Ex NYer, 4 years in the valley of the sun..via a 10 year \"lay-over \" in Miami.     My second job as a teenager for one year and two summers was at Tony's Pizza in sunnyside queens.  I was so promising the owner put me in the kitchen to make the dough and cook for each day.  11 hour a day job to cook fresh!   ABSOLUTELY THE BEST MOST CONSISTENT DELICIOUS HOME COOKING STYLE PIZZERIA IN THE VALLEY..All due respect to my chicago cousins.    AND NOT JUST THE PIZZA.... The specialties and sandwiches are perfect.           The place is spotless, staff warm and friendlly, extra sauce, cheese, condiments...No Problem...    Friends brought pizza from a chain to one of our football parties...and wings...    I went to rays.... ALL OF THE WINGS AND PIZZA from RAYS WERE SCOFFED UP BEFORE the first quarter.    THE Chains pizza....did its time in the microwave later and We had to toss the other leftover wings.    Dough's fresh, Sauce perfect, toppings fresh, Crust-perfect....I eat my daughters left overs.    One of the very few Pizzeria's that know what a \"white-pizza\" is and its made from scratch.     Theres only one thing they dont have...delivery.      Its worth every minute of the drive to pick up.  Dont trust me stop in for a slice."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the area. We go there at least once a month and are never disappointed. Great staff and fantastic pizza and wing special. You will love it."}
{"text":"Famous Ray's Pizza-Surprise... Damn if they didn't out do themselves. I had a SPECIALTY PIE request. One I personally built ( my own creation) at one time. I didn't really expect them to comply with my request, but after a little discussion amongst themselves. I got my pie. I have got to say, \"It was Delicious\". Not too shabby either as far as price went for the kind of items I had them put on it. Better than some of the other local pizza restaurants. Needless to say I was a happy camper. Thank You Ray's. I will be back."}
{"text":"If you are on a budget and still want great taste this is the place to go.  I spent $20 on a pizza and 20 wings.  The pizza is always made just right with golden crisp.  I love the staff they are always friendly and they keep the place clean. It is an older interior but they make it up in taste and service.  I also have tried their deep dish and its not that bad.  I prefer the thinner pizza.  I would recommend it to anyone on a budget that does not want to sacrafice taste and service."}
{"text":"The server behind the counter was friendly, ans the place looked clean. The crust and pizza were cooked well, and great flavor. It was just very greasy, and I wasn't offered peppers or cheese. Not sure if I'd come back for the cheese and pepperoni pizza, but maybe wings."}
{"text":"This place rocks. I love my NY style pizza and these guys get it done right over here. There's a reason why this place has outlasted all the other shops that were once on this corner and it's because of good pizza and prices. They also have a good lunch special so check them out sometime."}
{"text":"Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust."}
{"text":"So mad... How rude can an establishment be when they serve rotten lettuce and burnt dry wings with a so-so Pepperoni Pizza. $35 bucks wasted.  After we took the food back to just ask for a quick replacement we were greeted with distain and disbelief EVEN though the owner was staring at wilted, yellow, slimy lettuce and burnt dry wings with zero sauce (I ordered extra sauce by the way) We go here because it's close to the house (every time something is wrong, but we don't complain and just eat) but drew the line with the wretched salad and wings this trip and will  have to drive farther to eat good food next time (Lorenzo's on Scottsdale Rd and Pinnacle Peak- delish)  Sorry but this Ray's Pizza is horrendous and I will never spend another dollar here, nor will friends and family."}
{"text":"Better than Barro's, but still disappointing.  Got heartburn after eating it.  What causes heartburn, anyway?  Still looking for great pizza in this area.  On an aside, I was overcharged  by several dollars.  Didn't notice it until after I left.  Check your check!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The pizza is cheesy and saucy. The wings are great, the sauce is just the right amount of heat but I wish they put more of it on. The cheesecake is great and the canolis too!. They charge for extra ranch and the discount on the site does not apply to the Glendale location which sucks. The staff is nice."}
{"text":"Worst service i have ever had in my life. Ive been here 3 times. First time i thought \"okay maybe they were having an off night, it happens.\" Second time same nasty attitudes by the girl behind the counter and the owners. Thrid time was the worst. Horrible attitude. I asked if they could leave 5 chicken wings outta the 20 piece we ordered plain for my 3 yr old and the told me it was impossible. So i said fine can u do half with no sauce? They agreed and then charged me for sauce on the side. We bought a large fountain drink and their fountain machine was broken so i asked for a refund on the drink and the owner yelled at me, literally yelled at me with my 3 yr old in my arms about how it wasnt his fault and why couldnt i just drink water from the fountain machine. After making a scene infront of the other customers He slammed the money on the counter, shoved it to me and stormed away. Not a family environment at all and horrible people! There are other east coast pizza places and i will never go back here again!!!"}
{"text":"Omg omg omg. Best pizza place around! There is something about their cheese that they use... well maybe pepperoni... errr im sure its the cheese.   They don't deliver, but doesn't really matter to me since its only down the street.  It only takes about 10-15 mins for them to make it extremely hot (I never learn and burn my mouth)   Their wings are okay, not the best, but not the worst. The pizza definitely makes up for it.   ugh writing this makes me want some right now!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and I feel like there has been a drop in quality. I still drop in from time to time, and have relatively good service, but the food has gone down a bit. Apart from a few misunderstandings with the workers (due to heavy accents or other reasons), they are generally helpful and nice. I still vastly prefer Rays to other pizza places, and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since grand opening over 30 years ago. I grew up on it and now continue to enjoy it weekly. I just really love the pizza. Big slices just fold it in half and it's sturdy! The sauce is perfect. The dough isn't too thick or too thin. I don't like dough that seems like a lot of spongy bread. One of my favorites is just a cheese pizza that I ask to have a little more cooked to it's browned on top but the bottom is still perfect. I enjoy the subs (house special hot) salads, wings, and dinners come with bread and salad. They've kept it small and simple. It's family owned and ran, a great neighborhood pizza place that's been doing it the same way for a long time making great food."}
{"text":"I am something none of the other review aren't.  An actual New Yorker. To me there are about 4 different kinds of Pizza, the kind you can get La Piazza el Forno which is the top of the top, New York Pizzeria Pizza which is primarily what I ate in NY. Pizza that tries to be ny pizzeria pizza and the crap that doesn't even bother, your pizza hut, pappa johns all that. This isn't the best pizzeria pizza but it's good enough. The closest I can compare it to is NY Pizza Department which is in the same league but just different enough they put too much cheese on the pizza here but that's something I know for next time, The pizza is scolding hot when it comes out of the oven the way it's supposed to.   Its nice that Ray's is around the corner and happens to be pretty damn good."}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta dinners simply have no flavor. Very disappointing. The greatest turnoff however was the fact that the owner was loudly berating and arguing with one of the employees (a relative I believe) in front of the customers. It made everyone very uneasy and was extremely unprofessional. As a business owner, he should have known better and addressed his issues in private.  When another customer suggested as such he told her to mind her own business. He was rude and disrespectful and clearly in a very bad mood. Perhaps he should be putting that energy into improving the flavor of the food."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for the nights I get held up at work and don't have time to cook dinner. Not only is the food great but the staff make you feel like they are welcoming you into their homes rather than just another restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have always been a huge fan of Rays and recommended the establishment to others looking for close to authentic NY pizza  but my experience with them on March 3, Sunday, has changed my mind. We called about 15min before they closed (kind of a dick move, but they were \"technically\" still open). Service was fine. We ordered a medium white pizza and a plain calzone. When we brought it home (a 5min drive) it was cold. No biggie though, just stuck it in the oven for a couple minutes. Once we took a bite into it though.... UGH!!! The  dough was so tough it seemed that it had been sitting out for hours. I get it that we were probably one of the last orders of the night but this was worse than cafeteria pizza that had been sitting out through 3 lunch periods. Its unfortunate that this happened at one of my favorite spots, but I wont be returning. Head to POMO if youre in the North Scottsdale area. MUCH better and MUCH more fresh pizza!"}
{"text":"I dig this place, mostly, because of the square pizza.  You can find it on a platter when you walk in, and its really the diamond in the rough.  It is so hearty, and filling, and crunchy, and flavorful.   The staff reminds me of New York.  They sort of have an attitude, but you realize its not really an \"F u\" attitude, but rather they want to know what you want, and get it done.  They don't waste time beating around the bush - you ask a question, you get an answer.  Not with a smile, or a thank you - but, it feels like New York - what can I say.  They get it done.  At the end of the day, that's what I want.  When you are into your food the staff isn't in the dining room at all, so your conversations never get interrupted, and they never make you feel like you need to leave.    Did I tell you to try the square pizza?  Someday I am going to order a whole pie like that, and feed myself for a week!"}
{"text":"worst pizza i every had! salad was ice berg 2 slices of onion and 3 slices of tomato and olives, maybe a dollar of cost to them and charge four. had to stop at Wendy's to eat after spending 20 dollars for bad food!"}
{"text":"The pizzas here are delicious. It might not be as great as anything from the east coast but I don't know about that. I've never been there. As for  being in the east valley of Az, its pretty damn great. The ingredients are fresh and the dough is authentically hands tossed.  Everytime I come, the service is friendly. The price is a tad bit on the higher side but these pizzas definately aren't some $5 pizzas from dominos.  If you're ever in the east valley or Apache Junction area, ya might considered trying Ray's."}
{"text":"Best New York Style Pizza in Scottsdale. They have Slices & Square Lunch Specials during the week. Not sure about the weekend. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty. That about sums up this place.  You go up to the counter, point out what you want, pay at the register, and wait about five minutes for your slices to get warmed up. Pay attention or someone will yank your slices at lunch madness. Also, there's no table service or hand holding here - real New York style.  Some decent sandwiches as well, but the pizza slices are the main reason to stop by. Ask for the daily menu on slices and don't be afraid to request a knife and fork, we are in Scottsdale, not New York!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special. Got two slices of cheese and a drink for around $6 with tax. Crust was terrific with great crisp and no flop. Perfect ratio of sauce and cheese and the size of the slices were pretty generous and came out HOT. Loved it. Place is clean and the people were very friendly so it gets five stars, but rating the pizza 1-10, it gets an 8.5 from me."}
{"text":"Ray's Pizza, authentic New York Pizza, and the only place to get Authentic NY Pizza...end of story."}
{"text":"I have been going here as long as I can remember all the way back when I was in high school and the place has not changed. The pizza is the best in Glendale! Although I have not had anything else from here it is still the best place to gran a bite to eat. They serve pizza by the slice or a whole pie if you want the portions are big not like some other pizza places kids will have to cut 1 slice in half just to be able to pick it up, the price is comparable to the hut about 19$ for a large, but I mean large!!"}
{"text":"one of the best new york style pizza joints on the west coast. I love their huge slices of cheesy thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Just shy of being 5 stars. The service was great- people were very friendly. Place was clean."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed.  In my mind, when you're holding yourself out to be New York pizza in the Valley, you'd better stack up in three categories: crust, sauce and cheese.  This pizza didn't live up to my expectations in any category.  Let's start with the crust.  When I remember New York pizza crust, I think of a crust whose outside is crisp, but whose inside is still moist and doughy, allowing for a convenient fold.  Ray's crust reminded me more of cardboard.  The crust snapped in half when I tried to fold the slice!  Moreover, the crust didn't have any of the sweetness that I remember.  It had no flavor whatsoever.  Having saved the outer crust for last, thinking maybe that it would save my meal, I took one bite and stopped.    The sauce continues the flavorless theme.  There was no sweetness, no acidity, to the sauce.  I think they could have omitted whatever sauce they used altogether and the end product would not have been any worse.  And the cheese.  Despite the fact that my slice was put in the oven and came out piping hot, the cheese hadn't seemed to melt at all and didn't move at all from first bite to last.  In addition to not melting, the cheese (or should I say \"cheese\"?) was ... wait for it ... completely flavorless.  It didn't appear or taste fresh and completely failed to live up to the quality of even the shady $1 slices you can run across near Grand Central Station.  I would not compare this to Peter Piper Pizza, much less New York pizza.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"When I lived in Scottsdale, I would eat Ray's Pizza after Wado almost every Tues/Thurs at 8pm, the employees are great people, and collaborate very well. The pizza is always warm, delicious, and most importantly, safe. There's a reason the pizza is pricey people! It's pricey because they buy high quality ingredients to make sure you don't wreck your toilets!   I live in Tempe now, it's about a 15 minute drive to Ray's, but me and my buds still make the trip, and are more than satisfied every time.   The best part of the restaurant is the atmosphere, it's inviting, well lit, clean, entertaining (there are 3 HD televisions in the place), and family friendly.   To all the people comparing the place to New York and Jersey, you do realize this place is in SCOTTSDALE, of course it's incomparable!  If you're ever in the area, stop by and grab a slice, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Have had pizza at their scottsdale location many times and it was great. The food at this location is not so good! I will definitely never have pizza from here again I was excited when I moved to East Mesa that there was a Ray's close by.. Very dissappointed the pizza tasted very bland!"}
{"text":"This Rays never disappoints! Consistently delicious! Will happily pick up a to go order over delivery any day. Our pizza place of choice for 4 years since moving to the area."}
{"text":"Place has been on a slide last few years.  Loved the food when  they first opened.  As a NY transplant I was happy to have Ray's nearby. Disappointing  crust had a cardboard texture.  So little sauce that the pizza was dry. Cheese not fully melted.  The crust ends were skinny and poorly formed.  Slightly better than frozen supermarket pizza."}
{"text":"I been there on Monday,, ordered for alfredo chicken pizza,, awesome  good service ,, thanks for chef and front desk,,"}
{"text":"Horrible pizza / Horrible service. I was hoping the pizza would make up for the rude service by an angry woman with a New York accent. Owner? Scarey! . . . but that didn't happen. The watery, tasteless sauce, sat on top of chewey, undercooked dough like soup. I have nothing good to say about my experience with Ray's Pizza. My father is from Brooklyn and even he would be shocked by the horrible service. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for a slice of your favorite pizza!  My husband and I come here every Friday night.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  Their salads are amazing.  The small greek salad is huge and the pizza specials are very inexpensive.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sardella's is my favorite pizza chain in the valley, but this a good substitute in Surprise. Tastes similar to Sardellas, good wings."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and I've been trying desperately to find a great pizza place. I hadn't had any luck until I tried Ray's.    I walked in and placed an order to go for a whole pie with mushrooms. The employees were all friendly, and the restaurant was clean.  About 10 - 15 minutes later, I walked out with a piping hot pie that turned out to be the most delicious pizza I've had since I moved here a few months ago.    The crust was crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  The cheese was ample and greasy (in the best way possible) and it had just the right amount of sauce.  I have to dock them a star though because they use canned mushrooms.  They're edible, but I really believe mushrooms on a pizza need to be fresh.  If they had been, this would have been the most perfect pizza I've ever eaten.  Ray's has a new customer."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite pizza joint.  Ray's pizza has been in our neighborhood for over 25 years.  My family's favorite is the deep dish Sicilian pizza with the thick slices of cheese and pepperoni and the delicious hot wings served with celery sticks and ranch dressing.  When my family members, who live in the east valley, comes to visit they always stop at Ray's for pizza and their big salad loaded with fresh lettuce and vegetables.  Ray's customer service has always been top notch, and always friendly service."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere, nice people, and always an NBA game on.  This is no nonsense NY style Pizza.  You either like it, or you don't.  If you don't, I don't like you."}
{"text":"Consistent pretty decent pizza, wings and calzones.  One of the few places to still just grav a slice ....Nothing fancy but does the trick and it's priced right ....if you are one of the few that has never been it's worth a try !!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Rays since they opened. Pizza is always on point, great crust, sauce and toppings. Wings consistently great. Hoagie special is great cold but even better hot!  The guys working have been there since day one. Home town go too New York style pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Picked up two pies for a Superbowl party. Should have gotten three, they were gone too fast. Great flavor with the perfect amount of sauce. A chewy crust that is begging for the fold-over....NY style.   Wish they deliver, but even so, the best traditional pizza I have found in the desert. Even better is to stop in for a slice. When they reheat the slices they get and even better finish on the crust."}
{"text":"Great pizza place with a genuine feel.  Pizza is great and service is always with a smile. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Monster pie Sicilian style, every time! The best ingredients and sauce for take out pizza in the valley!"}
{"text":"First off the lady on the phone mumbles, ended up spending $9 more dollars because of miscommunication. It's impersonal, she gives you a number to remember.  Then, hoping my nine extra dollars goes far with the taste, and...no sauce, sour taste, and left me feeling crappy and shameful that my life has resulted in stuffing this cheese on bread triangle in my mouth.  As if that wasn't enough, crust was good, that's why the unfortunate matter of receiving an extra star had to take place. Dang integrity."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here, excellent every time! Great pizza, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We have ordered sandwiches from this place before , and they were real good. Tonite ordered a large Italian sausage and thin sliced meatball pizza on a thin crust. That was the BEST f----n pizza Ive ever eaten, period."}
{"text":"ordered 2 pizzas last night with wings one loaded other with cheese only. Crust was tough and both pizzas were not cooked long enough. The loaded pizza was a soggy mess in the center. There was a ample amount of ingredients on the loaded pizza. I would recommend ordering the pie well done. Wings were good nothing special."}
{"text":"Great place to go. Good lunch deals, great wings and subs, and the pizza is some of the best on this side of the valley. Also, staff couldn't have been better or kept the place cleaner."}
{"text":"Don't call this New York pizza, save your money and buy a frozen pizza in the supermarket on the way home."}
{"text":"I am from Brooklyn, and Went there for dinner one day and usually, the food, & the Pizza is ok, not like NYC-and this recent visit the owner very rude, especially when I asked for a special request. It was like asking for a million dollars, they said no and it's an inconvenience to the kitchen, but, not the ones paying their bills I guess, I was a little shocked, being from NYC I shouldn't be. In my business I go out of my way to accommodate my customers within reason. I don't need to eat there when  people have horrible attitudes. I feel they are too big for there Britches. Gone to their heads. This is the honest truth."}
{"text":"Ok. These guys are great! When they say New York Pizza they mean it. We just got a lunch special with cheese pizza and I can hardly wait to come back and try some other options. The crust is amazing. Highly recommend!! We will be back often."}
{"text":"Our family has been a customer of this Ray's Pizza location for over 25 years. We've ordered pizzas, steak & cheese hot sandwiches, lasagna, spaghetti & meatballs and other menu items all prepared with premium ingredients and first rate taste.  Steve"}
{"text":"It took me a while but I have been back to Ray's quite a few times since my first review.  The pizza is great!  By the slice is surprisingly good, every time I've had one it tastes as if it was lifted right from a pie fresh out of the oven.  I don't know if the turnover is that good or if they have some slice saving secret but I've had them at different times of the day and with different toppings and I've never been disappointed.  Fresh tasting cheese, good sauce and a  chewy thicker crust that has a crisp on the outside.  Oh the slices are gigantic too.  We get the Sicilian slices when they're available, we chop them up into small squares for a nice snack or save them since they reheat really well (and freeze well too). The full Sicilian pie is even more delicious."}
{"text":"Our aunt & uncle brought us to \"their favorite pizza place\" tonight.  super tasty pizza, amazing tiramisu dessert & best of all...the most friendly staff I've encountered in a restaurant is quite some time."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. They serve you nasty tough leftovers they couldn't sell at lunch time, they just add toppings and warm it up in the oven.  If you want the real Rays Pizza go to 83rd ave and deer valley road. I grew up next to this one and it never disappointed. Clearly there are different owners."}
{"text":"Great Pizza , and Subs !!  Pitchers of beer go perfectly with the fine Italian cuisine. Nice French fries as well ;) though .  Service is friendly and fast , just the way everyone likes it. The Cannoli tops off the meal  of your really hungry and want to add some delicious calories to bun off at the gym later ;)"}
{"text":"OMG this is my new favorite place to pick up dinner to go. The dinners, pizza and sub's are amazing. Great customer service. Everyone is friendly. As soon as I walk in the door I get this feeling of happiness and start smiling. I love that the counter employees say Hi with a big smile, then you hear a Hi for the guys cooking. Go check it out and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you are looking for REAL New York style pizza then you will love it here. The owners take pride in their food and we have never had a bad pizza. It's the only place we will get pizza from around here!"}
{"text":"Great place!!!  The food is amazing, the pizza, the salads, the cannolis, amazing!!  They are family owned, which I love and so friendly!! I go there once a week, just can't stay away!! I have ate at other Ray's and everyone says they are not as good as them.  Well I am here to tell you they are better!! My whole family is now hooked and this is our pizza joint for sure!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Calzones!!  Trust me if you order the calzone be ready to have some leftovers for lunch the next day..  Solid choice for Pizza by the slice..  Go get some Rays..."}
{"text":"Only reason not 5 stars is because they do not deliver. Food is great. Amazing customer service and feel is family owned!"}
{"text":"I love the rays on 59th and greenway, this place shouldn't be allowed to share a name. Not even the ranch dressing at this place was good, I just threw six sides of it away along with most of a gross pizza. My son said the cheesesteak was okay"}
{"text":"As yet another NY (actually, Long Island) transplant to the Valley I ache for good pizza like I can get back home....or as least as close as I could come to it. I found it at Ray's. Other places come somewhat close but their pizza is either too \"doughy\" or has too much cheese. Ray's is consistent. They have the right amount of cheese and the crust is done to perfection, just the right amount of charring on the bottom. What I also like about them is I can walk into their shop and pick from four or five pizzas that are already made, as I could with any pizzeria on Long Island or the five boroughs. Other \"NY style pizza\" places out here take upwards of 20 minutes just to get you a couple of slices.  Even though I live in south Gilbert, I have no problem driving to Scottsdale for this pizza.  Bravo ray's!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and the food was great.  Got a meatball sub and a calzone.  Both were delicious"}
{"text":"We really like the pizza.  We brought my father for dinner and he said this was the best pizza he'd ever had: my father is 96-years-old.  That says it all :-)"}
{"text":"Our go to pizza place! Love the pizza, love the owner and staff! Darn good value too!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype....just ok.   The honey BBQ wings were gross. Smothered in a ton of sauce! The regular hot wings (well done) were decent."}
{"text":"My entire family loves this place. The pizza crust is delicious (crispy, but not dry) and the sauce is amazing. Toppings are toppings in my opinion, and Ray's offers a good variety of them. The service is always excellent; I never mind stopping in to pick up my order."}
{"text":"3 stars for the garlic knots. I've had better, they were kinda doughey, but the garlic and butter flavor was good and you get a generous tub of marinara too. I think I'll stick to the pizza, the slices are PERFECT."}
{"text":"Dear reviewers, This pizza place is amazing! They make everything so delicious and are reasonably priced. I have been coming here since about the beginning of the year. Every time I go in they always greet you with a smile on how are you doing none of the employees ever seem upset or seemed distraught about work they all seem happy and it makes this environment very welcoming. I like how they normally have deals going on if you ask. They make you feel like you are at home and comfy while you eat some amazing Pizza. I would recommend to try once and see if you get hooked or not my only regret is that I did not discover this place sooner."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Got 2 slices that were clearly made yesterday if not before. Threw a topping on them and heated them up and called it fresh...for $7.  Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Great wings, pizza & calzone. Goes well with beer. We tried the garlic knots today & they're good too. This is one of our favorite Fri haunts. Try a canole sometime. Quite delicious. This is a nice cozy little mom n pop Italian place. Hope they do well & stay in business for a long time."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation on how good the food is. I was disappointed with the salad that had brown wilted lettuce that tasted old and the Sausage sandwich was just OK. Next time I will try the pizza only.....that's if I make it back."}
{"text":"Most disqusting pizza I have ever tasted. 2 Slices and a soda for over $8.00? Are you kidding me? Stop trying to imitate NY style pizza and create your own. This joint belongs to the same group with Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's and Little Caesar's."}
{"text":"Had the special 2 slices and med drink under $5. Great deal great pizza !!"}
{"text":"I was here about 2 months ago, (hey i been busy ok)  this pizza was very very good , I had  2 slices of white cheese pizza one with spinach one with tomatoes, 1st)  I was completely stuffed for about $5 bucks and it was some of the best tasting pizza Ive ever had - this side the mississippi ... im serious, and ill be back"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Even better calzones. All made by some of the hardest working business owners around. These guys work their store 7 days a week. It shows the quality of the food is the best!"}
{"text":"This pizza is so good that every couple of months i drive 30 miles there to get some. It's a journey of an hour total which is kind of insane, but that's how much I love this pizza.   There are many Ray's Pizza restaurants in AZ, but for some reason this specific Ray's is better than the rest. A lot of it in my opinion has to do with the older gentleman that works there. The guy is a pro. This is legit NY style stuff here.   the thin slice pizza is great, but I mainly go for the Sicilian, which is deeper (not deep dish) and square. I don't feel like I am being hyperbolic when I say it's mind-blowing.  To me the texture and juiciness of a pizza are very temperamental characteristics and Ray's bakes it perfectly. What you get is a very balanced slice that bursts with flavor. The ingredients all seem to go so well together. This cannot be overlooked. For instance, it matters that the pepperoni tastes good, but it's also important how the pepperoni tastes baked with the pizza. The ingredients used here are clearly all top quality and it shows.    Overall, if making pizza was considered art Ray's would be classical top tier stuff."}
{"text":"WORST PIZZA EVER  & I EAT A LOT OF PIZZA  Staff was nice and very accommodating but the food was awful.  Don't know what they do with their Itlaian Sausage but it wasn't chunks, it wasn't crumbled it was kind of thin sliced and torn into little pieces.  The pizza seemed wet on the edges.  I took that to be because the did not drain their mushrooms or vegies before putting them on top or maybe it was not cooked long enough.   Hand leftovers  decided not to eat them."}
{"text":"We have been ordering pizza and wings from this location for years. They have always been consistent with great food. The staff is always super friendly and even during really busy times they always want to make your order correctly. I've never had a bad experience here. I just wish they would do better specials sometimes. :-)"}
{"text":"This Ray's is as good as they get.  I've been to several over the years, but who hasn't?  I had never been to this one until I moved a few months back to the area.  I must say that I have never experienced poor customer service at a Ray's, but the customer service at this particular location is out of this world GREAT.  The employees smile so big it looks like it hurts and bend over backward to make you feel welcome and that your business is GREATLY apprecaited.  You ask for a ranch, they come back with three.  You ask for ONE extra wing sauce, they beg you to take two, and they don't even mention that there are already extras in the bag.  SO REFRESHING.  Oh geez, I got so caught up in the service that I neglected to mention that their pies are friggin perfect.  For New York style pie my wife and I like it a little crispy on the bottom with plenty of sauce and chees on top.  For a Ray's, this place does it perfect, every time.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Heard about this place forever from friends and finally tried it tonight.  SOOO disappointed. To start,  to lay eyes on canned mushrooms on a pizza?  Get out!  Tasted one and sure enough, rubbery and tasted pickled.   Couldn't cut through the crust with a pizza cutter.   It was so tough you couldn't bite through it; literally no sauce that looked like plain canned tomatoe sauce, thin dried up cheese, and the sausage and pepperoni had no flavor.  The black olives were fine.  Ha.  And so were the wings.  Need I say more?   Sure didn't get our pizza fix at all.  We decided Costco or frozen grocery store is much better than this.  Stick with Streets of New York."}
{"text":"This is the best Ray's pizza in town! There are several but for some reason this location just tastes better than all the rest of them, hands-down. The people that work there are totally awesome and greet you the very second you walk in the door. They're very accommodating and helpful. And the food is just awesome! Pizza pizza pizza!"}
{"text":"To say I was excited to see a Ray's out here for the first time would be an understatement. It's not as good as the Ray's in Manhattan, but it's damn close enough for me.  I love these \"pizza-by -the-slice joints. I hate when I'm craving pizza, but I don't want a whole pizza. So it's a good place for lunch, or to grab a quick slice if pizza. Fair prices and it's run by some real New Yorkers.  Tip- go with the freshest looking pizza"}
{"text":"This is the place I stop to pick up food when we get together for UFC events and playoff games.  I go for the life-reducing Monster Pie. With tons of peppers, onions, and meat, the Monster Pie isn't for the faint of heart. This pizza feels twice as heavy as any other pizza. Two slices will probably satisfy the average person's hunger.  The wings here are also pretty good. They're usually crispier on the outside, and don't have a lot of the messy sauce. The medium wings are mild enough for most people to enjoy.  The thing that really sets this place apart from others is the friendly staff. These guys have never given me an ounce of attitude. Everyone is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! Tried the pepperoni and it did not disappoint! Fantastic service and nice dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza parlor. Pizza here is amazing. Ask them to leave your pie in the oven so that it comes out crispy. The wings are my favorite and affordable. Ray's has been in the valley for years and it shows. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE Rays !!!  When ever I'm in Phx this is my first stop. I always get the pizza and wing special. Large pizza and 20 wings.  They have the best wings in valley !!!"}
{"text":"Being from the Chicagoland area I find it hard to find really good pizza in Arizona, but Ray's is an outstanding exception.  Ray's serves great New York style pizza! That is enough for me, although my fiance also loves their wings, fried zucchini and fried mushrooms, so every time we go we always end up with tons of leftovers.  The price can be a little expensive, but we find it to be worth it as the food is just so good!"}
{"text":"So here's the thing.  Intellectually, I KNOW this is not the best pizza in the world, let alone Scottsdale.  However, if you happen to be from New Jersey (as I am)... THIS is pizza as you know it.  What does that mean?  Greasy, chewy pizza that you turn into a pizza cone and pour the grease out.. and THEN mop the rest up with a napkin before eating... charred crust with BIG bubbles...served by guys in grease stained white aprons and thick accents.  Ray's is right next to the North Scottsdale Animal Hospital so it's likely enough that you'll catch a view of a doggy taking a poo while enjoying your greasy pizza (possibly one of my doggies, in fact).  However, all that said, Ray's is worth a visit, and if you're from NJ or wish you were.. a second, third, and 50th visit too."}
{"text":"Da a bomb! ** Great fresh New York style pizza. Great staff/ owners. Always smiling and happy to help. Even in the busy times(which is always) there speedy and delicious! Highly recommended for quality pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pie, on time for pick up. Reasonable, friendly and clean. Nice thin crust pie...."}
{"text":"Very rude people here.The pizza and wings are good but the people who work here have zero people skills.This will be the last time we come here to this establishment and spend our hard earned money.Even the pizza makers are rude.Redicilous.They get just one star and that's just for the food being ok"}
{"text":"I will say that the pizza in this place is delicious,  but the wings were under cooked and this wasn't the first time that we had dined there for lunch and the wings were not good.  Then the girl at the counter was rude, she went back and forth with me when asked if she could heat our wings, she then asked a thousand questions when I asked for a to go box for our leftovers.  After the customer service experience in this place my coworkers and I decided we won't waste our lunch break again by going there and dealing with that type of service."}
{"text":"We placed an online order for a large pizza and 20 mild wings.  Got home and the wings were bone dry.  Called non stop at 9:50 for the last 10 mins of their opening to see if we could run back for sauce but nobody ever answered.  Called today and got told their end says plain wings, and we offered to bring a copy of our online order and the uneaten wings back in and have new ones made and we were told NO!  My husband said well then how moving foreword should I prevent this when I ordered through your app, the \"manager\" said \" well don't use the app then\".  UNBELIEVABLE!!! I am SO PISSED off! What about customer service?  I know it's just wings, but it's the principle! And we live like 15 minutes away. Went there specifically because they have amazing wings and after understanding mistakes can happen and just wanting wings, Re-made, they weren't willing to make it right.  They will never get our business ever again."}
{"text":"So glad I took a chance on this place. Clean, fast and friendly service. I especially love the lunch slices have light crispy crust with just the right amount of sauce. Yum! :-)"}
{"text":"Just in the area dropping off a friend for a graduation event. Stopped in for a spinach and mushroom slice. The other Rays Pizza I went to before had fresh mushrooms and spinach. This place used canned mushroom and spinach.  My pie was cold at some points and luke warm on others. They used the pizza that looked to be sitting there for an hour. +.  Not only was it $9 for both slices, the service was like 5/10.  I was the first to say hello out of the 4-7 employees on shift. Wall art and murals are enticing. I was going to ask for a refund but I didn't want to waste and have another trash can eat better than 50 percent of the worlds population. I'd say just go to the gas station and grab a burrito next time."}
{"text":"They call this NY pizza???? They need to have their head checked. The furthest thing from NY pizza is more like it. Tried to pick up a cheese pizza... Yep, a plain cheese pizza. When carrying the pizza outside it felt like it weighed 6 pounds - it was undercooked and the cheese was out of control... When I went back in to return it, the manager couldn't understand what was wrong... Never again!"}
{"text":"Always treated like family. Enjoy the single slices and delicious pizza . I am a regular, that can't get enough Ray's pizza."}
{"text":"I rate the pizza as 4 stars but the service is 1 star. I'll have to agree with the previous posts about good food but crummy service. I am a huge fan of their pizza, but honestly, I'm a little frightened to go in there to order. I sometimes feel as though I'm rushed to order my food. They seem really impatient and it's almost a bother to them. When they do shout out  that your food is ready, I have no idea if it's mine or not. Typically you have other customers just looking at eachother wondering if it's your food or theirs. They are just plain rude but the pizza is so good, argh! I don't know if it's because of the service or what, but lately that place seems kinda empty. Would it kill you to crack a smile once in awhile?"}
{"text":"By the slice is best Whole pie was dissatisfied with quality and lack of toppings  Will not return"}
{"text":"I moved from New Jersey to the West Coast 15 years ago, and I have been searching for great pizza. Ray's is by far the best pizza I have had since moving and is always fresh and great.   The pizza is a little pricy but totally worth it. This is our go to place and I even have a NYPD pizza across the street. The customer service isn't the best but the pizza makes up for that. If you are by a Ray's, I suggest you try it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and ordered for numerous parties. Always good food and service. Owners are nice people."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times in the recent months.    Each time we have ordered whole pizza. And also had the special which includes wings.   I have been very happy with this style of pizza. And wings have been very good also.  Wings are meaty and have nice cover of sauce without being over powered.  I will say that this style of pizza (in my opinion) is better with only a few toppings.  Once you add too many toppings, it seams to come out a little heavy.  Will stick to the traditional one or two toppings and keep it more of the NY style.   I have only been there in the evening and ordered whole pizza. So I cannot comment on whether it is a good place for one or two slices.  I will say that the pizza that was under the lights at counter did not look very appealing or fresh when we came in in the evening.  I would probably avoid the one/two slice order based on appearance.   But want a good whole pizza, this is my place!!!"}
{"text":"Last Friday (4/21), we stopped in after not having been there in years.  Ordered a pizza and had a pitcher of beer while we waited for our take-out pizza.  Put a tip on the receipt for the entire bill even though 3/4 of the bill was for take-out food.  While we waited, the young man who processed our order stopped by table to advise that the $5.00 tip would not process on our credit card because all tips must be processed before they run the card; not wanting to short anyone, I grabbed a $5 out of my purse and gave it to him...ONLY to find out today that, in fact, the tip and cost of pizza and flat beer did process on my credit card.  What inappropriate business practices.  Based on such dishonesty and other recent reviews (read Jesse's from 9/2016!!), we will not be back"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I LOOOOVE this pizza joint! We live walking distance (if we really wanted to walk there....) and order more than we probably should. The antipasto salad is delicious and enough for 2 people. Their white pizza with spinach is my absolute favorite! Everyone is always super friendly and they're usually pretty accurate on the timing if you order to go. The large pizza + wings special really is a solid deal!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! Very good service. Delicious cheese pizza! We always order same pizza and ask to do extra crispy."}
{"text":"Great pizza, I would definitely have it again. They had a special going for 2 medium pizzas, which we got, and the crust was the best! The smell when you walk in is awesome, you can tell right away their pizza is good."}
{"text":"The wings were great and the calzone was good. But, the \"Italian\" submarine hoagie sandwich. Horrible. I could have done much better making it myself at home. Not much meat and it was almost tasteless, except for the vinegar they give you to put on.  I will not be back for any sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped in here this evening before grandsons karate class almost next door. Greeted with friendly smiling faces. Generous servings of Eggplant Parm and salad were delicious. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Strange that my husband I have never been here when it is so close to our home. But finally we did last weekend. I have never had a pizza with so much toppings. We ordered a pepperoni with mushrooms. Sooo good. and we had a draft beer while waiting. I have never had a colder mug or colder beer. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A two star is generous. I have heard of Rays pizza and was stoked to try it. I ordered through the third party delivery service and had no options for a half and half pizza. I placed it under additional comments for the pizza (which I know they read because it had the directions to my hotel and room I was staying in and it says it on my receipt.) Needless to say I got a whole Hawaiian Pizza but still optimistic it will be good. The pizza was cold and floppy making all the toppings come off in one bite. The wings were cold and the garlic bread was over well done. Not a good first impression and definitely not worth $50.00."}
{"text":"My guys love love this pizza... They say it's the best combo of cheese and crisp of the crust. I did try the wings and just not a fan, but if you want great pizza then you'll love it here. I came back and had the 10\" gluten free pepperoni pizza and it was awesome! Best Gf pizza I've had!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good!  Also ordered an anti-pasta salad, which was good as well.  We ordered the meat lovers pizza, which wasn't too greasy.  That's a plus in my book.  Only thing was, it said meatballs were on it, and I didn't see any on the pizza, but there was a large meat that was sliced, so perhaps those were the meatballs?  Anyways, it was good.  Want to try the calzones next."}
{"text":"Goodness. Best pizza and wings in the area. Not the cheapest, but more than worth it. The \"slice\" app that you use for mobile ordering is very easy to navigate. Friendly service and great food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love rays ..on 35th and union hills ..food is in large quantity for the price ..always fresh ..wish they delivered ...I usually go there once a week ..a great variety on menu.lb"}
{"text":"A group of students walked over here after class and we split 3 pizzas, spending less than $5 each for about 3 slices each I think.  I just needed to update that I am not a fan of most veggie pizzas, but the veggie pizza here was so great & filling, I actually didn't miss the meat!  The mushrooms & tomatoes were great...actually, now that I think about it, the lack of green veggies but the variety of others was what made this pizza so awesome.  As always, the staff rocks."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer for 7 years and recently I've noticed but the Pizza has changed. The pie itself is much smaller than it used to be. I remember one slice would take up the entire paper plate and now I can put two slices on that same size paper plate along with a couple wings.   When I went in I noticed that there were new people behind the counter making the pizza so I'm guessing this is why. Its such a shame because now I have to find a new pizzaria."}
{"text":"Monster Sicilian pizza and 40 wings every time. so good!"}
{"text":"WORST PIZZA EVER!! Talked to another location owner of Rays Pizza on 35th ave and Union Hills. These are not chains. The location on 35th ave and Union Hills is the best by a longshot. The owner/cook at Happy Valley skimped on toppings, sauce, customer service and he has a piss poor attitude. At the 35th ave and Union Hills location their Monster Sicilian Pizza blows the Happy Valley pizza out of the water."}
{"text":"This place is good eats.  Wings are very good traditional deep fried hot sauced wings.  Thin crust is better than anything I ever ate in NY.  And deep dish monster Sicilian is only second to Lou Malnatis in Chicago.  Yes it is that good.  I love the way they slice the sausage so thin.  Very cool.  Quality is spot on and tastes the same each time I visit.  About once a month.  I wish I lived closer but I am about 8 miles south of this location."}
{"text":"Best pizza and customer service in town!!! The staff is always happy with a huge smile!"}
{"text":"The pizza was nothing special. We came here on vacation and were just looking for a quick place to grab lunch, the pizza sitting on the counter for the lunch special had to be reheated in the oven and then served. I dont know how long it had been sitting there but it tasted old. The service was okay but it was just your average run-o-the-mill kind of place. nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm actually pretty shocked there aren't that many 5 stars.   Well, I've been going here since they opened and I actually consider them to have one of the most authentic New York slices here. Not like the fake \"Grimaldi's\" New York style, but the kind that everyone references.   Growing up in NYC myself, I thought it was good. I've tried the chains of Rays and well... they're a chain restaurant, I'll leave it at that! Lol.   The owner of this pizzeria is actually blood relative of the original rays in NYC.l and is INDEPENDENTLY owned. Makes sense now!   I hope the other reviews don't stop you from trying out this great pizza joint.   Ps. You know it's a real pizzeria when they have garlic powder in a bottle for easy access"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker who moved to Surprise, I was very happy to find Ray's pizza. It is the closest thing to a real NY slice you can find in Arizona, and you can't beat the friendly service either. I've even tried their pasta and it was just as fantastic as the pizza."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good prices and huge portions, it's my go to pizza place"}
{"text":"Grew up back East NY/NJ area so I am fine with being a Pizza Snob.  Have to say that Ray's Pizza is one of my favorite Pizza's in Phoenix Area.  Giving it a 4 star because the mushroom pizza is not very good.  Mushrooms taste like can mushrooms.  Other than that everything else is fantastic.  Tastes like home."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I've never had their numerous other Italian dishes, but it all looks amazing!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping that this was the place that would crack the lousy pizza streak that I have encountered in the Phoenix metropolis. The place was called ray's, which is the gold standard for good pizza in New York, the cook said the owners are from NY (upstate I later learned) and things looked New Yorky from the photos. Ordered a large meatball (homemade and they were the best part) for about $16. Pizza wasn't cooked enough because the cheese shifted on the way home creating somewhat of a cheese tidal wave in one corner of the box. It looked good, but there was major issues with the crust. It was off and it didn't look like NY crust, it was breaking apart in the box and although it was foldable, too much cheese made it not a great fold after all. Basically, the bottom of the pizza was somehow undercooked as well and it just didn't work out well. Owner/Cook was a nice guy and will probably try a hero next time, but avoid the pizza and the search continues."}
{"text":"I have, on many occasions, seen numerous cars in the parking lot in front of this restaurant around dinner time so we decided to check it out. An odd experience in that the pizza was neither good nor bad. It wasn't flavorful and it wasn't flavorless. The service was not surly but neither was it accomodating. The ingredients were canned mushrooms,canned sauce, and some kind of Sausage Cellophane substance... seriously, the sausage looked like micro thin brownish plastic wrap. We were each given a single paper plate of the thinnest, cheapest variety (you know the ones with the corrugated edges), which was instantly soggy and useless. No one ever inquired if all was well or if we needed anything or even a simple \"how was everything\". The staff was there to \"Get Paid\" no more. Just kind of left me a bit depressed. Oh yeah, the medium pizza we received was cut into 4 humongous slices, each of which could have been cut in half themselves... who does that?"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner and love to support any local businesses. We have hit this place three times now and have been happy each occasion.  Yup, it's NYC style pizza and I'm a Chicago guy but, they do a very good job. Crust is doughy and flavorful and toppings plentiful.  Service is fast and friendly - and it is definitely a family run place! Prices are right as well.  One knock - the wings are on the small side but we like the flavor so not much of an issue for us.  Overall - Very good local pizza joint we are happy to put in the rotation!"}
{"text":"just got the same pizza girls there were super friendly!! and as usual pizza is amazing!! large meatball and pep!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, fair prices, nice friendly people!  What more can you ask for?  Thank you Ray's for all that you do!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have amazing food and customer service! The atmosphere is exciting and I always have a blast when I'm there!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Pizza is good and affordable only $5 for 2 slices and a medium size fountain drink."}
{"text":"Classic NY style pizza, great counter service, basic wings and a limited Italian menu. To quote Cookie \"You ain't gonna get any nouveau, amandine, thin crust, bottled water, sauteed city food.\"  This is great pizza-101.   The Arizona bureau of weights and measures should use this pie to measure all other NY style pizzas in AZ.  Its hand tossed, thin soft crust, has a little tomato sauce and quality mozzarella that leaves it a bit greasy.  Also being named Ray's helps as much as using NY city tap water in the dough.    I agree with some other Yelper's the wings, salads and other menu items are fine, but the star is the pizza.  You can get by the slice so don't be afraid to drop in if you are by yourself or in a rush.   I have been eating here for around ten years and love the owners.  The guys up front don't know how to stop smiling and I don't want them to.  If great classic pizza makes you happy, come get your smile on."}
{"text":"I go to Ray's at least once or twice a week for lunch, I've been unable to find a better pizza joint in the area. Their white pizza is delicious and possibly the only reason I continue to go back. A little pricy, I'll usually just order my pizza and grab a drink from the vending machine back at the office. I've never had a problem here, the staff is very friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Rays pizzeria is my local pizza joint i hit. It is one of my favorite pizzeria's usually get Sicilian style same prices as a regular slice of pizza but i get toppings of sausage's $.50). There sausage is sliced thinner than a pepperoni not those rabbit turds. They have lunch special of 2 slices of cheese and drink for just around $5,lunch offer times are m-f from 12-3. The employees are great and put customer service e first for buiz. The bathroom is always clean as well the dining area. CHECK EM OUT ITS REAL NEW YORK PIZZA STYLE. SUPPORT THE LOCAL BUSINESSES."}
{"text":"Prior to our visit last night, my wife & I had the impression of Ray's as being a of \"a slice of NYC in 'The Valley.'\"  Not any more!  Much has changed. Never impressive as a \"clean\" restaurant, the floors and tables looked and felt dirty. We both ordered the \"Penne Pasta\" dinner. The salads were as we remembered, though smaller in size. The garlic bread was served with so much spread, that the bread could not absorb it, and as a result, it trickled down our throats as we bit into the bread.  The main dish was a shocker! The penne pasta was smaller in size and \"cooked pre-al dente.\" The sauce was practically non-existent, as the excessive amount of grated Parmesan cheese \"sprinkled\" had turned it into mush.  While we were \"eating,\" a take-out customer entered the restaurant, approached the cashiers, and demanded her money back for her order which she claimed was \"poorly cooked and inedible.\" Had she been refused a refund, we would have jumped to her defense as our \"food\" proved to be the same.  To add insult to injury, we also had ordered a single slice of cheese pizza that was in the waitresses hands but never given to us, it went to another table. Fortunately, they did reimburse us for that oversight.  In our opinion, \"Ray's has seen better days.\"   Looking for an authentic New York Italian experience in \"The Valley?\" In our humble opinion, seek out a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is always good and ready quick! Love their pizza and wing special."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in a while. We got one with Just mushrooms and cheese. Didn't even ask for extra cheese but it was loaded. The sauce is perfect. Stands up to the mozzarella but doesn't overpower it. And it was a genuine NY style crust.   Can't wait to try other stuff on their menu. I'm sure everything is delicious."}
{"text":"I am a New Yorker.  Rays pizza is the closest thing to NY pizza that I have eaten in Arizona.  It has melting cheese, and olive oil that sort of runs off the slice. Their sandwiches are delicious and I love their antipasta salad.  The place is spotless and you can see the kitchen.  Everything is made to order.  Counter help is very friendly and nice.   good place for a slice or for dinner and lunch."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 3 years now. The service only gets better and better.   I cant speak for the salad because i dont eat rabbit food.   The wings are bomb. Im a MILD guy through and through. Love their flavor.   Want a Ray's secret?  Their calzones are AMAZING!  So much food for what you pay and tastes sooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this place, and right off the back I found it very homey. I looked at past reviews and boy it made me hungry. The service here are very friendly, smiling, laughing, bickering, just like a family, well at least like my family. I took out this time but waiting for my food was interesting enough to keep my appetite. Food kept rolling out to the customers at the tables at a fast pace and boy did it smell and look yummy. The mozzarella sticks were soooo good, breading was on point. They gave me salad and bread sticks on the side that I didn't know about. The chicken wings were crispy, juicy and spicy just the way I wanted them to be. Lastly the spaghetti, was amazing. The meatballs were not overcooked, the sauce was a littlw tangy from the tomatoes which enhanced the flavor. All in all, I noticed family after family came in and out with smiles on their faces. It is a diamond in the rough for sure because food looks bomb and tastes great too.  I'm really glad I found this place, and I plan to come back :)"}
{"text":"Had the thick crust Sicilian pepperoni 3/14/2009, took it to the drive in movies, and while it was expensive (23 bucks), it was worth it! This baby could feed 6 people, and it was pretty good as well. I wouldn't get this on a regular basis because of the price and the calories, but I think its the best pizza they have."}
{"text":"Good Pizza and sure beats the chain pizza companies around.  I really like the pepporoni pizza and the sicilian slices were delicious.  Perfect amount of pizza crust to toppings.  Delicious.  If you are looking for authentic NY pizza give the sicilian a try.  My only complaint is that we were charged for ranch when we ordered the chicken wings."}
{"text":"$20 pizza and wings is a great deal. The sauce was tasty and the wings were perfect. Management please start carrying blue cheese for the wings."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have had in years.   Just moved here from Hawaii and we loved every bite !!!"}
{"text":"I wish they would rename this Ray's Wings & Pasta. Wings are the best in the area, something I've been hunting for 6 months. Pasta was absolutely amazing on all three fronts: flavor, cheesiness, volume\". Pizza was decent but could go without next time."}
{"text":"I was craving a huge slice of NY style cheese pizza.  I decided to give Rays another shot.  I ordered a pizza and 20 wings.  Cost me about 20 bucks or so.  I asked for the wings to be cooked well and extra crispy.    Got home and dug in.  The pizza looked great.  Huge slices.  Lots of cheese.  And then I took a bite...umm I think some laffy taffy got into the yeast.  I had to literally close my teeth and yank back with my head to remove a bite of it.  Im not talking a little chewy it was like putting my teeth and jaw into over drive.  When I want a NY style pizza I want a foldable light crisp dough with a slight chew after the bite.  This was far from my expectation.  The sauce was also over board for me.  Oh well I already knew my taste and Rays pizza doesnt exactly agree but I was still hoping it would click.  I decided to give up on the slice and go for a wing.  I open the box and shake my head.  Whats this 16 wingettes and 4 drumettes??  Nice.  Thanks Ray.  I understand drums are more popular but this is a bit insulting.  Nice and crisp you ask?  Nope.  Cooked as if I never even asked it.  Nice and chewy not chewy like my pizza but rubbery skin chewy.    I ask my wife what she thinks.  She says well you already knew what you were getting into from the last times.  I can't see my self giving this place any more business."}
{"text":"The owners must be in the witness protection  program. Authentic Brooklyn pizza in Scottsdale. It's true east coast pizza, family owned and Great service. If you want to taste NY Pizza out west, this is the spot. If not stay home and don't be a hater!"}
{"text":"Ray's Pizza is a good, go-to spot to grab a slice or a full pie. I'm not sure why there are 5,000,000 Ray's Pizzas throughout the country, because there cannot be that many dudes named Ray, but I digress.  Anytime you walk in, you are greeted very warmly, and there are always at least five different types of slices available. In addition, Ray's has Sicilian slices, which not many places do- which is also a bonus. After you pick your slices they go in the pizza ovens for a quick reheat- and the slices come out and taste amazing.  The dining area is vast and clean, with plenty of TVs to watch as you eat your pie. All in all you cannot go wrong here, unless you are weird and get a salad at a pizza place, which in that case you are strange and your friends talk about you when you're not around."}
{"text":"There was no Ray's Revenge, but this place is strange to say the least. They have a slices special for lunch, but there are no slices displayed. It is one of those pizza places that makes the individual slices in the back where who knows what is taking place. Usually that means poor food and/or leaving, but we gave it a try and it was not bad, not great, but foldable. Likely won't return due to unusual language being spoken (Russian maybe) and an empty place around lunchtime. Spruce the place up, bake a few pies for display at lunch and then we can talk. Price was 5 bucks for 2 slices and drink, so that was fine. Oh, using magic marker on your pre-printed menu to raise prices is not a good look."}
{"text":"First time I ordered from here.  I am from NY and this is NOT NY pizza!!!! Unimpressed to say the least! Barely any toppings on the pizza as well as cheese. The fried mushrooms and zucchini were a joke....completely overdone! Garlic bread looks like hot dog buns and barely seasoned. Spent $45.00 to get a nice sample of everything...no where near worth it!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza. Although the cheese is so so but the bread and tomato sauce are amazing. I love the way Ray make the bread for their pizza. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"This place should have been gone long ago!  Buy a frozen pizza, you will be better off.  My daughter and I got sick eating reheated pizza.  Weirdo guy working there.  I will never go back,"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to come here for some pizza while we watch the Football games going on. So why not some Pizza and wings and football, what's better than that????! We ordered a large pizza, two slices of cheese, 20 wings and a cannoli. The total was about 35$ which isn't bad to be honest that's pretty reasonable for all the food we got. The pizza was very greasy which can always happen when you order pizza but it was a little to much for myself. The wings we asked for Crispy which kinda came out that way but the texture was gross and the amount of chicken on them was just not enough. The cannoli was okay it was way to crunchy on the shell and it broke apart and I couldn't eat the filling. So if you want pizza that's greasy and wings that aren't that special I guess this is your spot. The customer service was okay nothing to wow about and the wait time was good only about 10 minutes so that was good. So for my experience Rays pizza is okay."}
{"text":"I've had two bad experiences here, both were the same issue.   Once, was on new years eve. There was a young girl working the register. Once we ordered she informed us that even though it was not posted anywhere, they would be closing an hour early and that we would not be able to eat our food there. Luckily we hadn't paid and left.  The second time we went in the other night, it was 9:50pm and the store hours for that night said they are open until 10:30pm. We noticed there were already chairs sitting up on the tables and they were cleaning the place out. Once more we went in and asked if we had enough time to eat. The guy, who I believe is either the owner or manager of this location said \"It depends on what you order and how long it takes us to fix it and how long it takes you to eat it.\" He went on to explain that they like customers out of there well before 10:30pm and that they are only open that late for pickup orders, even though this is not mentioned anywhere on any signs and seemed to be more of a on the spot rule.   It's hilarious that some businesses get by operating like this. We live right down the street and wanted a good little dinner time pizza place to go to.   The food itself is honestly not worth the price. The meatball sub is small and doesn't come with any chips, pickle or anything and the bread is too doughy. The pizza is very bland and as some one else said, always so scorching hot that it will burn a hole through iron if you're not careful. It's overly greasy, thin and just very bland.  There's so many better choices in the area for pizza establishments, don't waste your time on this one."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  I called in my order ahead of time and still had to wait 15 minutes once I arrived.  I like to support small chains/mom and pop shops so I figured I'd finally try out this Rays on Deer Valley.  The place was so packed I feel no need to support it after finally getting my pizza and wings and getting home because I was ultimately disappointed in the product.  This style of pizza and wings may just not be my cup of tea.    I ordered a pepperoni and jalapeno pizza and 20 hot wings.  The pizza was covered in cheese.  I like cheese on pizza but each slice felt like it weighed half a pound.  Were talking mound of mozzarella that didn't have much of a flavor in it.  The sauce was too thick and pasta like for me.  I think it would be good on raviolis or spaghetti but it was much too thick to be on a pizza for my taste.  The bread was okay.  I believe all the cheese and sauce damaged the bread instead of complimenting it.  On its own I think the crust would be much better.  The jalapenos and pepperonis were nothing special.  Tasted like normal store bought toppings.    The wings were chewy and not spicy enough nor did they have any kind of spices or seasoning other than red sauce.  I'm not a fan of wings that aren't crisp and have nothing more than franks red hot sauce doused on top.  Very boring and old school.   I may be back to try a sub or calzone as I remember them being good from other Rays locations I've been to before.  I cant imagine ordering pizza or wings from here again.  I may have been spoiled from all the amazing pizza joints popping up in the valley the last decade.  But more than that, I personally would even prefer pizza and wings from places like Barros and Sardellas over repeating them from here."}
{"text":"The prices are a little high and the food is ok. I have had better pizza. The wings where also ok. The people where nice both times we have eaten there."}
{"text":"Ugh I can't say how much I love this place. When I was a child my family and I would order from here all the time. I moved away to Atlanta for five years and I missed the pizza from here. It's just as I remembered it. But tonight I placed a pick up order and when I showed up I was greeted with a warm smile and a friendly hello. Luckily my order wasn't ready. I had messed up on what I wanted so it was confusing to them but the lady behind the counter was so amazing she was able to get what I wanted on it before they put it into the oven. But as i sit here waiting for my food I'm watching them and this is some of the best customer service I have ever seen. Take it from me I run a small restaurant myself and they beat mine out.   If you haven't had their pizza you need to try it. It really is amazing but the service is even better. Keep up the great work from the kitchen staff to the front of the house staff as well. Thank you for continually making fall in love with this place more and more."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have had the wings, gluten free pizza, calzones, fried zucchini, and more. Everything is great! And they know you by name the more times you come in. Family owned and personable. Love it."}
{"text":"Over the last 12 years, I have tried just about everything on their menu and also created some of my own things. This place has amazing food, good prices, and staff that makes you feel welcome and valued"}
{"text":"This place is the best on so many levels!! For one, the pizza and the food are always awesome!! I'm a native New Yorker...born and raised for 34 years, and I can honestly say that this pizza is authentic New York style!! The wings and the Chicken Parmesan hero are also the best! The staff is always friendly. The owners are hard working, extremely friendly, eager to please, and very appreciative of your business. I love walking into the place and having the owners greet you with a sincere welcoming!! I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"My wife, our grandson Michael, our friend Kathy R. and I went here lunch a while ago and I forgot to submit a review so this is long overdue.   I'm from Rhode Island-born and raised--and have had pizzas from authentic Italian mom and pop pizza joints so admittedly, I am hard to please when it comes to Italian food.   This pizza is good: perfectly greasy, cheesy, chewy,  gorgeous, flavorful and is always piping hot, very fresh, and the cheese and sauce are excellent quality. While Ray's isn't the best pizza I ever had it was to my likings. I do appreciate a good pizza.   Some people may think  \"pizza is pizza,\" but you'd be wrong. It is hard to find a real good pizza in Arizona especially because I was raised back east and have had some great pizza.  One of the more expensive pizza restaurants in town. In addition they don't have delivery.  It's good pizza! But not mind-blowing. The crust is actually super fantastic.  FOOD:  It wasn't the best pizza I have ever had in Arizona but it's right up there in the mix. The pizza was a typical New York style pizza, nothing special although the pizza is always piping hot, very fresh, and the cheese and sauce are excellent quality. CONCLUSION: I didn't think it was anything special as far as taste / flavor goes. The ingredients of the pizza tasted fresh and I believe it was of high quality. Good pizza, but not as good as some. Their pizza is between OK and I'm-a-fan-  RETURN FACTOR: 100%]  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT"}
{"text":"6 words.. Burn your face, Shit your pants.  If you like overly greasy pizza that falls apart with cheese slapping you in the chin while trying to take a bite, then having an immediate stomach ache afterward, this is your place.  Rays has been around for a while, but I remember it being a lot better when I was in High School.. Perhaps it was an off day, but It just, wasn't good. And the girl at the counter could not have been hating life more.   next."}
{"text":"I have been going to Rays for years! This is the best pizza in Arizona. New York pizza is amazing and Rays is just as good! For the one who left a bad review, you must have left a review for the wrong place. Pizza is perfect and delicious every time and their wings are great too! Plus they are cheaper than the wanna be pizza places like papa johns pizza hut and Dominos."}
{"text":"Clean  great service food is awesome best cheese steak you could drive for hours and not get a better sub  refills on drinks  sports on 2 TV's good price also"}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite of ours, but wow have things changed for the worse. Stopped by for a couple of slices last night and instead of the great pizza they used to make, what we had could have easily been beaten by a frozen grocery store pizza. Very little cheese or sauce and what little cheese there was had zero flavor. The veggie slice was laughable - a cheese slice with a mound of canned veggies and a ridiculous amount of onions that were barely cooked. I don't remember them using canned mushrooms, but they do now. No such thing a fresh ingredients here! Sad to see what used to be a 4 star pizza joint come to this."}
{"text":"Its hard to find good pizza in Scottsdale.  There's a lot of fluff restaraunts that spend more money on decor and advertising than quality chefs.  Ray's is basic.  But that's what you want.  You don't need to have 5 star seating with 1 star pizza.  This place has the best pizza within 10 miles.  The Sicillian is awesome, but so its the regular pizza.  Its the best of New York style without dripping fat or floppy dough.  Give them a try.  Its worth it."}
{"text":"I have been going to this rays pizza for years.  They do not pay me for this review or probably don't even know I am leaving this review.  The service is second to none.  The food is amazing.  The slices for lunch are huge!  Some of my favorite wings in the valley too!"}
{"text":"Typically great wings.  Just ordered crispy, came out gross and fatty, undercooked.  Customer service terrible, I told and showed cashier who did not fix order and responded poorly.  Sadly as a regular customer, I will not be eating at this location anymore and would recommend that you not eat here either."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a few times and each time the quality of the food has gone down. The most recent a time ordering from Ray's, the pizza was horrible. The cheese just slid off of the crust whenever we took a slice out of the box. The crust was soggy, I wasn't sure what caused it, but then I noticed the excess grease at the bottom of the box, making both pizzas a complete disaster. Soggy crust, a lot of grease and subpar toppings, the two pizzas weren't worth the amount I paid. I could've taken my family out to a decent dinner for around the same price. If it were up to me, I'd order from a chain pizza joint before ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, check it out!  Always better when eating in and delish as take out too!  We are from the East coast and this is the closest we can find to replicate."}
{"text":"Just had the WORST experience with these jokers. Ordered online (through Eat24) only to get a call 30 min later to tell me they don't deliver to this area.  Too bad for Ray and crew they work with Yelp/Eat24.  Screw all of you people.  I'm not happy with 15 hungry people waiting for food now I need to go figure something else out."}
{"text":"The pizza is true New York and very good. Single slices are offered which in my world is important. Prices are middle of the road. Service is friendly and prompt. The tables are regularly bussed and the restroom rating a 7 out of a possible 10. All-in-all a pretty good pizzeria."}
{"text":"Good pizza an awesome service also not to busy so your food is out fast an prompt.   The owners are also nice an well mannered an treat you like family."}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza and wings. Love to get their specials. Sometimes I'll spring for one of their pasta dishes. Always solid"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! Every time I got they are super nice and the pizza is delicious. I order a pie to go- so I haven't tried the pizza by the slice. Oh and don't forget wings, they are great too!"}
{"text":"I love this place reminds me of NYC !   Very authentic NYC pizza.  Sicilian and white pizza are amazing."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good and the people are so nice! The only reason I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 stars is because their ranch is gross store bought buttermilk crap. I'm a huge ranch and pizza person so I was disappointed but it was still delicious"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza and wings in Arizona!! Ray's has the best crust, toppings and sauce. Their wings are crispy, juicy and all-around amazing. The staff is always friendly and eager to serve. If you're looking for a good place to get pizza and wings you must check out ray's."}
{"text":"Sickening, I made the mistake of getting the white pizza (don't remember the exact name). I think it may have been sitting out all day and possibly not fully cooked to begin with. I had a horrible case of food poisoning and an unpleasant trip to urgent care after my last visit here."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this rays pizza for years now! I have to say it has always been a 10/10 experience and 10/10 when it comes to their food. This time Katy took our order promptly and was very friendly, also she is a hilariously good conversation. All their staff seems to enjoy their work and are always is great mood! The pizza and wings always come out to perfection, they really do have it down. If you're in the mood for a cold beer with pizza and wings, this is the place hands down!"}
{"text":"I've been here lots of times and it's been 5 stars every time! They're a family owned business (I love supporting small businesses) and their food is good! They have a special flavor that makes me come back. They are very clean and friendly and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and always enjoyed the pizza here. Thin NY style crust the way I like it, good sauce and toppings, very informal and relaxed atmosphere. Can't really say anything against it, other than that it's too close to my gym!"}
{"text":"This Ray's Pizza isn't so much of a \"restaurant\" as much as it is a \"high caliber happiness factory\" constructed by the gods themselves.  The staff here consists of some of the best humans to ever grace this planet with their glorious existences, although I suspect that at least a few of their workers are secretly angels on earth with invisible wings.  Silently protecting us.  I would compare the experience of eating this pizza to looking at your first newborn child for the first time, in terms of overall happiness felt.  Life is difficult and terrifying.  Humans can be so cruel and evil.  Let us rejoice that Ray's Pizza exists as an illuminating light in this dim, dark world.  Thank you, Ray's Pizza."}
{"text":"Not bad pie but probably not up to NewYorker expectations...  Ordered two slices and 20 wings (hot). One slice with mushrooms, one pepperoni. This Ray's uses canned mushrooms, which is ok, and they loaded it up for us, and the pepperoni was classic NYC style, thin crust with lots of grease. I'm giving them 4 stars but subtracting 1 star for the wings. Sorry guys. Buffalo wings NEED bleu cheese dressing and a couple sticks of celery... there is no other way. Do some research, ranch dressing doesn't cut it. period. The sauce was fine, but they needed to be a tad bit more on the 'crispy' side when cooking, other than that, they were good / ok. Would I go back? yea maybe, though there are so many more places to try... I not sure if I ever get back over on that side of town, but thank you guys... you have a good operation... clean & friendly, As a consolation they treated me to a refill on my soda. Thank you.  Hope you could make these small changes for your future customers ;)"}
{"text":"When I come into town to visit family, we always come in for a couple of pizzas and wings - the meat lovers pizza is so good.  Good selection of drinks including beer.  If they delivered, that would be a bonus."}
{"text":"Great pizza! A little on the pricey side, but it was definitely a good quality, homemade pizza. Crust was very delicious. We ordered two large pizzas and it was enough for about 7 people."}
{"text":"I don't know why some people were writing bad reviews about this place the are nuts and don't know what REAL pizza is.I grew up On Staten Island,NY and the ORIGINAL RAYS was on the Manhattan side of the Staten Island ferry and it was the BEST pizza ANYWHERE,except Italy.The same family is involved with Rays and the wings are delicious.I'm sorry to see this one go.I don't know what happened.We have to go to Scottsdale,a sister pizzeria, to get this authentic and delicious pizza.It IS worth the trip."}
{"text":"I grew up on Staten Island,NY.One of the oriinal Rays was on the Manhattan side of the ferry.The smell was enough to send you into a feeding frenzy.I discovered the rays in mesa years ago and cannot go near without stopping,sadly last time we were there it was closed,what happened???Fortunately I found another in Scottsdale,a sister pizzeria,and it's worth the drive.Never had pizza that when you picked it up a bit of olive out rolled off.Now that's the pizza I remember.YUM!!!!!  If I could make pizza like this I'd be set for life."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona visiting my Girlfriend and in the mood for pizza and wings.  She recommended this place.  Turns out, it was a great first time visit to a neighborhood feeling pizza place.  The service was casual and friendly.  The food was that no frills neighborhood pizza place, that you love to order from.  We had pizza, wings, and salad.  Everything was great.  The wings were plentiful and zesty!  The pizza was also equally as great!  In the mood for pizza, wings, and salad, then this is the neighborhood place to visit!"}
{"text":"While visiting in town, we were told Ray's was pretty highly recommended so we gave it a try for lunch. The place was empty when we arrived a little after noon and most of the time we were there (except for a few people getting take-out). The staff was very friendly and provided excellent service. Not only did they have canisters of red pepper and Parmesan for seasoning, they also had containers of garlic powder and Italian seasoning for the table. A very nice touch! Unfortunately, I just was not very impressed with the food. We started off with an antipasto salad which was simple and had a variety of tasty ingredients but the dressing was pretty flat. The garlic knots were a little overdone and did not have much flavor unless you dipped them in the marinara (which was pretty good). The pizza tasted OK on the hot first slice but, for me, you get to see the true nature of a pizza when you get to the second or third slice. The pizza just didn't hold up as the cheese had little flavor and the sauce appeared somewhat bland.  It looks like the owners really want to make their customers happy so I'm disappointed that I could not provide a better review. I would be willing to try Ray's again so maybe I'll have better luck next time."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's far from my home, but close to my brother's so whenever I visit him, I need to get some pizza and wings.  Large cheese pizza and 20 wings runs you $19.99.  Can't beat that for what you get.  The wings are exactly how I like them... crispy and Frank's hot sauce on them.  Pizza can get a bit card-boardy but I love the sauce and cheese.  It reminds me of the Pizza Den in NJ."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Great chewy and crispy crust and wonderful sausage mushroom herb pizza! We have ordered takeout pizza here two times now and will be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years... since when i was pregnant with my now 4 yr old!  Since then, the quality has changed. We used to stuff ourselves silly, and still be craving the pizza afterwards. I don't know if he changed brand of ingredients, or gotten a bit lazy, but the quality had surely changed. Still good but not like it used to be.   Really cheap food. We get the Large pizza and 25 wing special for $25, which is a great deal if you ask me.  We love the owner. He always asks about our daughters if they aren't with us, and makes us feel like we're special customers. The kids he hires to help out are really nice and friendly.   Whenever we're in this area we'll continue to come here, because of the owner and the memories we've had here if anything. I just wish the food was the same."}
{"text":"Ray's pizza had been a Friday night ritual for my family but we usually order from the Peoria location.Pizza is always consistently good and the thin crispy crust is too die for. THIS LOCATION IS NOT THE SAME! The quality of the ingredients is way lower & the staff are just plain rude.The girl who took my order over the phone was rushed & short seeming she wanted to hang up on me as soon as possible.We ordered our usual a marinara cheese & sausage and a white sauce spinach tomato and ricotta pizza.I called them the exact names as they are called on the menu.And yet when my father got home with them the order was wrong.The \"spinach pizza\" was just a cheese pizza with bitter tasting canned spinach lightly strewn over it. DISGUSTING.I had called back to simply let them know their mistake & the same girl on the phone gave immense attitude from the start saying it was all my fault & she had just assumed I wanted it like the first pizza.WE WILL BE GOING TO THE PEORIA LOCATION FROM NOW ON!!"}
{"text":"Spent 15 years in Manhattan, its pretty great pizza. Its my new favorite. The crust, the sauce and the big slices. Try a monster pie or a slice."}
{"text":"Grabbed a couple slices from here for lunch. I went in a little before 2pm and it was very quiet (yet all the parking in the front of the place was taken...)  Employees were courteous, service was quick. But 8 bucks for 2 slices that have been under a heating lamp? Don't get me wrong, the slices were yummy but gourmet this is not."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place the employees are always happy always smiling and always so polite one of their best foods there is the calzone. They also have good lunch specials."}
{"text":"So glad we found this gem.  The food is quite delicious.  We ordered two cheese slices for our boys, mozarella sticks, a pepperoni and sausage calzone and lasagna.  The portions are huge!  The slices were a meal in itself for the boys.  The mozarella sticks were gooey and fat.  The calzone was ginormous and according to the hubs, very good.  He couldn't finish it.  The lasagna was freshly made to order and so very flavorful.  It comes with bread and a salad.  Lots of food and every bite awesome.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  Love this little hole in the wall and the fact the owner and workers knew many customers coming in and out by name.  That really says something and probably why they've been in business so long.  We will definitely be back whenever we are in town for a Cardinals game."}
{"text":"We heard the pizza was good and we were willing to try it UNTIL we called for delivery... in order to do delivery, you have to order through a 3rd person. WHAT? When I order I either order direct from the business or not at all, so it was not at all, how do I know who this 3rd party person is?  Sorry Ray's, you missed out."}
{"text":"I've been in AZ for 11yrs by way of NJ.  So when I happened on this place I fell in love. The best NY style pizza I have tasted since being back home. Mmmmm and their hot wings with fresh garlic, as I love them, to die for! Don't forget to add a big pitcher of cold frosty beer! Now you got yourself a Friday or Saturday night meal!!! The pizza & wings are my fave, so much, I have never tried anything else. So yes, I would have to say this place has the best pizza ever! (Been eating here for years) BUT wait there's more!!!! I will never ever ever eat there again! I would rather buy a pie from Walmart & pop it in the oven at home! And the wings, I throw down myself at home, hot, lemon pepper, teriyaki, spicy garlic.....whatever flavor I can make that right at home!   Why? I thought you'd never ask. As my family & myself dined one evening on a pie, wings & beer, just as we were finishing up our meal my daughter looks to the side towards the back of the store and there the owner is sitting at a table picking his nose feverishly, mind you there's a bathroom right behind him if he needed to go and clean his nose, therefore wash hands when returning to work. As a customer enters the shop and stands at the counter waiting to place an order he gets up and goes right behind the counter and serves this customer food, never ever stopping to wash his hands!!!!  It's times like this I wish I was an undercover food inspector!!!  Now if you have read any of my other reviews you can tell I am a bit of a germaphobe. And this little stunt  and booger the owner has pulled, has lost a customer in me and my family forever!!! This review gets one star because I cannot give it anything less and like I said their food is the best so if you do not mind a little boogering in your food, then go for it!"}
{"text":"Been going to Rays for years.  Great pizza, subs, calzones and wings. Only thing I do not like is they do not deliver."}
{"text":"Before we discuss the food:  BE AWARE that if ordering online, there is a $1.50 \"transaction fee\" AND a 3.5% \"processing fee\".  Now for the food: as we stepped inside the first thing I noticed was Ray's had the proper Italian restaurant aroma and we were greeted with a warm smile. Our food was ready at the promised time and the salads were packed separately and kept refrigerated.  The lasagna and manicotti were certainly not the best, but my husband and I have definitely had worse.  The lasagna noodles were a bit on the thin side, as seems to be the current trend and I definitely prefer the old school thicker noodle.  The lasagna portion size and meat sauce were generous (enough for leftovers) but the sauce seemed to be missing a little something.  The manicotti portion size and sauce were also generous (once again enough for leftovers) however, per my husband, the filling was virtually tasteless.  The antipasto and garlic bread were the stars of the night!  The salad was very fresh with lots of goodies and the vinaigrette and croutons were excellent.  The garlic bread was yummy, garlic-y and buttery without being too greasy.  Both the lasagna and manicotti improved after sitting overnight and being reheated in a low temp conventional oven.  They made for a delicious dinner the next evening.  We will definitely  try Ray's again, this time for a pizza or calzones.  Who knows, maybe both."}
{"text":"Wow' I love a thin crust pizza and this is great stuff. Always hot and fresh daily. By the slice is a great fast lunch any day of the week! Try the Chicken Alfredo! Delish!"}
{"text":"Went in to eat and tables are not suitable for bigger families. Pizza was pretty good however we ordered thin crust and didn't get it. It was a little greasy and slices are huge. I would go back giving them another try."}
{"text":"Ever eat a pizza with friends? Thats what its like at this Rays. The employees are awesome! Friendly! and Fast!  Pizza is fantastic and cost friendly. Try this place, you'll love it."}
{"text":"The name Ray's is used by over a hundred places in New York. In fact, several NY papers and TV stations have tried over the years to locate the \"original\" Ray's and as far as I know they've failed. One of the Ray's contenders in NY had a Yelp review that started: \"... can be summed up in 4 words \"It's better than Sbarro\"  Tough crowd!  So what exactly is a New York pizza?   Well it has a very thin crust, that when you pick it up, the front flops down. That's why New Yorkers fold it in half. The better tasting ones seem to use San Marzano tomatoes and a better type of mozzarella.  A few dust their pizza with oregano or EVOO.  This Ray's is the closest to that New York pizzeria feel and atmosphere.  It has those glass counters that you will find up there.  It even has what we call Sicilian slices, or \"squares\".  This Ray's tries real hard and for the most part it succeeds in creating a New York pie. So it's \"A-OK\" in Yelp-ese.  In my previous review, I said that NYPD makes me feel like I'm waiting for an E train to Queens; whereas Ray's feels more upper east side-ish.  I still believe that's still a fair assessment, though their crusts have suffered over time.    On some nights, depending on who is making the pies, these two places might only be slightly better than Sbarro.  Sadly, the crust can sometimes be as hard as cardboard.  So after two and a half years, which one do I believe is closest to tasting like a New York pie?    Well... it may be the nearby Philly steak place Corleone's.  Go figure!"}
{"text":"Delicious greasy pizza. The crust is nice and crunchy. The cheese is delightfully gooey. Great lunch place!"}
{"text":"Margarita pizza is so good. Literally put me into a food coma"}
{"text":"As close to NYC pizza as you can get. My fav is the tomato pesto. It was so delicious. Now I know why pizza is the complete food. Ray your making Scottsdale a sister city to the Big Apple. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"First time ever at Ray's. There's a location near where I work but it always looked a little too seedy. Tonight we were all set to head out for dinner at Outback Steakhouse for my birthday. I figured that the q-tips and their snowbird brethren would all be in bed by the time we got there (7:20pm) but no, the woman there asked me if I had call-ahead seating and when I said \"no, er, how long's the wait?\" she told me it would be 40-50 minutes. I basically walked out of there, pushing past some Minnesotans on the way back to my car. I'm not standing around for freakin' ANYWHERE for that long, not even a Ramsay restaurant. We wound up driving to Ray's on a whim as I just couldn't be stuffed trying to figure out anything else.  Got a giant Sicilian \"monster pie\" (ie a supreme) - they kindly left a single square without any topping but cheese, for my toddler. Took about 15 minutes to cook, but that's fine because we're an uber geek family - we iPhoned, Droided and Leapstered up and next thing you know, the food was on the table. It was possibly the largest pizza I've ever seen and yep, it was square. Took a slice and went at it with knife and fork; I get real messy if I eat with my hands, especially with something this size. The bottom of it was real hard to cut - crunchy. After a couple of slices, my right index finger had a rut in it from pressing down so hard on the end of my knife, and my fork looked like Uri Geller had taken it up the wrong 'un.  The pizza was actually pretty good. Good enough for me to finish about four slices of it. It reminded me of the Chicago 7 (one of my favourite pizzas ever) from Old Chicago over at Bell and 57th. The kid actually ate more than expected, about half of his slice (which is a typical sized meal for a toddler like him, way more than half a grilled cheese sandwich). It was late so I didn't let him finish the rest although he probably would have. The wife finished two slices. We still had about half the pizza, I'm guessing almost 2 pounds of food left to take home. Everything including a free pitcher of soda for $21 including tax. Not bad at all. Considering that on my recent trip back to Australia I paid $120 (US$128) for lunch at an Indian restaurant for three adults and the kid, I'd say that a meal of this magnitude was pretty good value - quantity and a decent amount of quality too. I didn't mind that the pizza was a little crunchy on the bottom, it actually lent it a good texture. Maybe that's standard for Sicilian, maybe they overcooked it, who knows - I'm not an expert. But the wife gave it three out of five stars, which is actually above average for her, and I'll give Ray's that on Yelp as well. Bye bye one week of eating reasonably healthy, hello exercise bike."}
{"text":"USE to be the best Pizza in town. Unfortunately that was like 10 years ago. Now this place is overpriced at about $10 for 2 slices and a drink. Trust me you can find better pizza almost anywhere and they charge for ranch as do most pizza places. But isn't a pizza joint charging for ranch the same as a burger place charging for ketchup?"}
{"text":"Hi Ray's this is Linda!  I'm the cheese and tomato pizza customer.  I love you guys.   Excellent family owned business.  Run by the family. They call me by name and know what I want without telling them.  Personable. Friendly.  Happy place.  Put out quality food. We love their pizza and calzones.  Sandwiches are great too.   All employees are very nice.  The family guys who make the food are funny and personable.  Be ready for them to say \"my friend\" to you.  Go early Friday's. Gets packed quick."}
{"text":"Rays is a slice of the east coast; the pizza is good, the staff is great, but the sauce! Oh goodness it's great!  Get yourself some garlic knots and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has always been good, both food and service, for the last 10-15 years that we've been coming.  We're not the types who are dedicated to one place (there's just too many good pizza places out there), but we do stick to local, rarely the pizza giants, and this place is in our rotation.  They only have Bud Light on tap, which is kind of a downer, but they said they're working on getting a better selection.  We've only ever gotten the regular style pizza, the Sicilian, and the wings, but all of it is always delicious, and has never been a let down.  The staff is always over-the-top friendly and helpful, and will bring your order out to the table, even though you order at the counter.  If you're in the area, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"The cashier said they raised the prices. That's good for the owners, I have no complaints there. But when the girl told me the price..WOW!..I was being charged $20 for the one slice of pizza and salad combo. The menus price states $6.95. Granted she said \"they charge something like .15 per topping\" This is sad because this was our favorite place to order from. Time to look else where"}
{"text":"This is a special treat for us as we don't eat pizza and wings often, but they have the best in the area imho! Service is fast, and always friendly!"}
{"text":"So good!! Great prices! Quick friendly service! I had the calzone and it was a little too big at first. Once I tasted it I cleared the plate."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! Best NY style pizza in the valley. Nice friendly staff and they are open later than most! They have gluten free pizza now too and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"We live around the corner and come here for pizza and beer couple times a month. this one is a little family owned one with the same people always working which is nice. The pizza is always delicious, fresh, and crispy! The booths and chairs are outdated but other than that it's cute on the inside."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Being from jersey I feel embarrassed for the clowns that run this place that call it \"pizza.\"   Here's a clue...travel to the east coast and look at the crust to make sure you know its thin and doesn't taste like cardboard. And when your sign says open till 1130 on Friday and it's 1030...try and look polite and invite your customers in by taking their order.   All they had were 8 nasty slices of pizza made like yesterday denying to even make you a cheese pie with 1 hour left until they close.   Welcome to America and learn to treat your customers with respect. We're the reason you have anything. Don't worry I won't be back to hassle you with making me pizza at YOUR pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"I've lived across the street for two years now and finally decided to give this place a try. The pizza was so thin that when I went for my first bite the whole untie pizza just fell apart. The crust is super thin and Can't hold anything. I don't like how they also charge you for toppings, you are already paying enough money for the pizza, it should come with a topping. The only good thing about then is that the wings are actually good, so if you go there just go for some wings. The pizza is not good."}
{"text":"This place was great!!!  The staff was CRAZY friendly and on top of all requests from your order to getting you to go boxes.  The food was good but this place went above and beyond in all regards of service.  We tried the wings and the pizza and everybody in the family agreed we need to go back our next time to the area.  NY Style pizza in a hospitable friendly environment for the win!!!  D."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was somewhere between 6-9 years old. I am not sure when they first opened exactly but I was there (I'm now 30). 21+ years later and up until 5 years ago (when I moved)  I was in like once a week. I still drive up to Scottsdale every so often just to eat here. It always has been and always will be my favorite. Granted I liked it better before the remodels and expansions but that's just me stuck in the past. Many of the people who worked there when I was a child still do today. I have eaten here well over 1000 times. And I'm not kidding, granted I have only ever gotten two things off the menu cheese slice and cheese Sicilian slice. Seriously try it."}
{"text":"Great ny style pizza.   The right amount of crust thickness.  Feel right at home.  Get a slice you will love it."}
{"text":"Take this place off my list!  First of all, they are very disorganized, no system at all.  A coworker likes going to this place so another coworker and I decided to try it.  What a disappointment.  $7.00 for a lunch special of drink, salad and slice of pizza.  NOT WORTH IT!  After placing our order, we paid, no one told us what to do next, we stood around looking lost, then a server comes out with our salad, we told her where we wanted to sit.  We started eating our salad, and again, lost... Where is our pizza? So I go back to the counter and one of the guys behind the counter asked what I was waiting for, and I said the cheese pizza that comes with the special.  No one had gotten the pizza ready so he gets a slice of cheese pizza, I told him two please, he sticks it in the oven to warm it up.  Again, I am standing not know what to do or what is going on.  After 5 minutes, I asked how long it will take to warm up the pizza, he says it's ready, takes it out, puts it in this cheap thin paper plate and hands it to me and I had to almost run to my table as the pizza was HOT and I didn't want to burn myself...  Eeeks!   The salad is packaged, pizza too cheesy and soggy.   Nope, this place is totally off my list..."}
{"text":"DON'T BOTHER: The experience at this \"restaurant\" was so atrocious it made me want to quit trying new things. Front staff possess ZERO people skills, bathrooms look like they should be in GITMO, and that's all BEFORE you sit for a slice. Your money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on Hayden. Apparently they're not the same.  This pizza was most closely related to cardboard. The pizza was ready quickly so I added a couple stars for that."}
{"text":"Ordered their dinner deal, large one topping pizza with 25 wings for $20.95! Loved the deal, but the food was just okay. The wings were sauced perfect and had great heat (ordered the medium) and flavor, but the pizza was sub par. The dough was really tough and chewy like someone had kneaded it to death. The service was lacking, my husband asked about substituting the type of pizza we were ordering and the owner stepped in and gave this long winded explanation of why it was a bad idea... Next time a simple \"no, we can't substitute\" would be more than enough."}
{"text":"Talk about horrible customer service. Their pizza was horrible and drenched in grease. It took 10 paper towels to get some off it off. They have horrible attitudes  towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food. I've worked in 5 star restaurants and would've gotten fired on the spot if I treated a customer like they treated me.  Beware! This place is the worst place I've ever been too. I would take Peter Piper Pizza over this crap."}
{"text":"Pizza in Phoenix is all just ok... My good friend told me without good water you'll never get good dough. Rays has a good sauce and a great mix of cheese only if they could have good dough"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have had a great experience every time!!!  I can only base this review on the pizza because I haven't tried anything else.  The employees have been friendly every time and the place is always clean.  Hard to find a place that makes Sicilian pizza out here and even harder to find a place that makes it good.  I get 2 slices every time I go, 1 regular and 1 Sicilian, and they are always MMM MMMM GOOOOOOD!!!   Thanks for bringing me back to NY even if it's only for the few minutes that it takes me to eat my slices."}
{"text":"well i will never get a pizza from rays ever again.    i picked on up last night and got it home and took a bite of the crust and their was a small rock in the crust.   im sure it was from the flour.  so that will be my last time at the place.   check out our ingredients better.  Their are a lot of better place for pizza. And its not RAYS that'S for sure."}
{"text":"Two slices of cheese and medium soda for 4.28 including tax. Can't be beat! Delish!  Lunch special.2 slices and free medium soda for 4.28. This place is so yummy."}
{"text":"This Rays Pizza is amazing! They have very good authentic NY style pizza and their bone in wings are out of this world!!!! The specials they have are great prices as well! Large pizza and 20 wings for $20.95. And if you are hungry for dessert.... Their cheesecake and tiramisu is to die for!!! Definitely eat at this Ray's pizza!!! The owners and staff are also so amazing and always really friendly!!! We love coming to  Ray's!!!!"}
{"text":"It's horrible pizza. Order four large pizzas and out of the four times I have gone the pizza is extremely greasy. If you like greasy pizza then go for it but its horrible."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars.  3 for the pizza, it's not fantastic. Maybe it's because I prefer Brick Oven style pizzas, but these pizzas lack flavor. I've been here on a couple different occasions and left unimpressed both times.  But, the service is 5 stars without a doubt. They're super friendly, will strike up a conversation with anyone, about anything. From the second you walk in the door to the moment you leave the staff here is wonderful."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I ordered a couple of slices of veggie pizza. It was loaded with fresh veggies and I love that, but the overall taste of the pizza was just OK. This pizza must be eaten immediately, the leftover slice 2 hours later made me wanna cry. I only ate half of it and sadly threw it out! I spent way to much money for bad pizza."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years, and man has this place went downhill.   First, to start with what seals the deal, the woman \"serving\" us was TERRIBLE. She actually put a piece of pizza fresh out of the oven in front of my three year old daughter. Before I could move it the hands went in, and my daughter was burned. Rather than being caring, apologetic, or anything else she could have been she chose to roll her eyes and walk away as my daughter screamed hysterically. I touched the pizza myself and it was way to hot to have served period, much less sat in front of a toddler.   The pizza, man has it changed. It tastes as if it has sat out all day. Odds are it has, so no surprise. My wife got two slices of veggie pizza, and to my surprise there is now (maybe always been there just not charged, who knows) a 55 cent PER TOPPING PER SLICE charge. Her two slices were almost $15 by herself! Sure, it is on the menu as such, but what other pizza joint goes to the literal number of toppings on a specialty pizza?   Needless to say, we will not be back. The lack of common sense and sympathy by the waitress alone would have sealed that deal, the pizza tasting like a cheap take and bake was just icing on the cake. Don't be fooled by the 4 stars this place has, they have really gone to isht...."}
{"text":"Super nice staff with great service. Pizza is chewy with no flavor. I sent the canzone back because  the ham was not edible. Sorry Ray., I won't be back again."}
{"text":"lasagna to die for.  inexpensive, fast and no frills.  get this stuff to go and enjoy it at home.  we crave it.     Monster Pie pizza...nothing better out there!  Staff could be a bit more friendly (the girls at the register) but ...we over look it cuz the food is good."}
{"text":"Great pizza the white  pizza is the bomb !! Their wings are delicious as well! The guys are always super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza joint, but knocked down 2 stars for using CANNED mushrooms on the pizza. Ewww. That's a no-no."}
{"text":"The pizza had no flavor would rather of had frozen a pizza. We also had fried mozzarella sticks and Fried Zucchini when they came out they were burnt."}
{"text":"Simply put--awesome. Awesome pizza, service and price. I could not have left happier or more satisfied.  Had a lovely conversation while we were there with the staff and they are so down to earth with the NY accent to boot. Not sure how they managed to get to The Valley of the Sun but I'm glad they did."}
{"text":"The best local pizza that We've found in Surprise. Order at the counter. We have only had the thin crust variety so can't say anything about their other menu items but based on the quality of the pizza we wouldn't hesitate to try anything"}
{"text":"I overheard and watched the owner being very rude a customer who asked about gluten-free customer say that and his place he's the boss here and he'll do the things he wants and he doesn't want to here about gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"Great food lots to choose from fresh ingredients. I suggest this place to all. Better than Spinatos."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years! Great pizza and wings; get the $22.95 deal and you save $8!! Good lunch specials too!  Pick up ordering always ready within 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"Ray's has been a staple in my diet since my father discovered it in the late 90's. I will and do drive 23 miles from my house for the best pizza in AZ. When I order a pie, I'll order it with extra sauce, light on the cheese with a crispy bottom, but then again, I am from NY. When I go to get a slice, it is tasy, although a little bit heavy on the cheese for me, but a Zoni's dream. I love the spinach and tomato slice. Warning for vegetarians... they have chnages their pasta sauce to incllude sausage. Not my cup of tea in the slightest. I'll stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"I have tried pizza all over Arizona, California, Hercegovina and even Italy the home of pizza, but Rays Pizza is THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE HAD. Been coming here a long time and the food is always on point. If you haven't already try it out. The pricing is good for delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"I love Ray's pizza. The owners are very friendly, the service is quick and the price is right. Ray's is great especially if you are just looking for a few slices as you don't need to buy a whole pie here. (Unless you want to! I have in the past and they are nice big sizes!) The garlic knots are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Rays for as long as I can remember the food is always great, however tonight I am not pleased with this visit. In fact its truly enough to never give this place my business ever again. First of all let me start by saying I tried to call my order in multiple times before 9:30pm none of my calls were answered. I 4 god damn times. Ridiculous. By time I get there from my work its 9:40 I walk in and try to order 4 slices of pizza and an order of wings. The employee literally tells me they cant do that because \"something like that would take too long about 15 minutes\" EXCUSE ME???? They don't close until 10:30pm, I looked it up to make sure!!! Its 9:40pm. Im so disgusted with their customer service. Especially when I just left my own work late from customers coming in late, but I still treated them as if they came in earlier as you should with good customer service. Been coming here for YEARS, to be told I cant order what I want is so disrespectful. Never again."}
{"text":"Found rays online while staying at the  cibolo vista resort. Only about 5 miles away from resort and very good . We purchased from them 2 nights in a row .   We ordered a large veggie-with chicken  large pepperoni and 40 wings mild and med and everything was delicious . Only complaint they forgot to give my drink . 2nd night basically a repeat of previous order minus the pepperoni pizza. No complaints would recommend"}
{"text":"We love Rays Pizza. The food is great and the service is amazing . They always make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"Got a pizza and wings for get together. I went in and picked it up. I wasn't prepared for how quick the transaction went. I told him told him what I wanted and he gave me a number and said it'll be ready in 20 minutes. Boom done. I showed up in 20 minutes and the pizza just out of the oven the wings just came out of Where are the wings come from and I was on my way. Price was good too."}
{"text":"I went here for my first time last night. It's really good! Excellent thin crust New York style pizza. Home made dough, hand tossed. Cooked perfectly and the pizza was huge. We went in there at 1130pm also, right before closing and they were very kind and had no issues with taking our order. And they didn't rush it, they made a great pizza for us as if it was the middle of the day. I'm very impressed all around."}
{"text":"I have been to Ray's twice. Once for an Eggplant Parmasean Sandwich and once for a Meatball Calzone. The Eggplant Parmasean was Meh and the Meatball Calzone had me saying \"Where's the Beef?\". The Calzone really didn't have any taste. I will never go back to Ray's."}
{"text":"Great staff. The pizza was good but the dinner plates were paper. Would have been 5 star if plates were provided."}
{"text":"I consider my self a connoisseur of pizza and wings and Rays is by far one of my top 3 favorite pizza and wings spots and right now my favorite place to go for pizza and wings! They have a great large cheese with 20 wing special.  I get hot wings extra crispy and they are top notch! I add sausage to the pizza and the sausage is thinly sliced and gets nice and crispy when baked...AMAZING pizza and BOMB wings!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza place, my second time here brought my mother she agreed. And far as I'm concerned if my mother the pickiest woman on earth and if she likes it then I'm sure it's as excellent as I think. The thin and thick crust are both amazing, I can't decide which I like better."}
{"text":"The Food:  I ordered the 1-slice of pizza and a salad special for $7.25-ish. The pepperoni pizza was good and the salad was decent sized and tasty as well.  The Price:  In a fast food world that has created a standard of a \"meal-deal,\" I thought Ray's was deceptive. Here's why:  The real deal was actually:  1-slice of cheese pizza (any topping is an add-on, which was not posted or not very visible)) and the drink was an additional $.75 (which was posted).  In the end, it was $9.25-ish for the \"Special\"  Overall it was good but the pricing is somewhat deceptive.  Suggestion: I would post all specials with the price of the drink included and have an option of at least one free topping on any pizza deal."}
{"text":"Mmmm crispy hot wings! I'm forever sold on this place. Ray's has good pizza too but I've only had it at the Scottsdale location. It's clean and quiet at the Glendale location, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"I've been going to school up the street for the last 4 years. I can't go more than a couple days without stopping by Ray's for lunch. Can't beat a slice of cheese pizza, six BBQ wings, and a Mountain Dew from Ray's for lunch. I'm moving and there's nothing in this area that I'll miss more than Ray's. Friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"It took us a while to find some good pizza parlors in this area. Now in the last few months we have found some! We were not sure if we wanted to try this place? It was empty, and the crew was just sitting around doing nothing! So we went in, I ordered the pepperoni and bell pepper pizza well done. Wife order their spaghetti and meatballs. Unless my mom made the spaghetti, I'm not eating it! Their pizza was very good, the sauce had a lot of flavors, not sure about the crust yet. But the pizza is well worth an other visit!"}
{"text":"Well we finally tried Ray's after hearing a lot about it. The girls and I stopped off on our way home.  We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, with a mixture of BBQ and mild wings. The wings were really good. They were brought to us hot, wings had a crispy texture, and they both had a great taste. Now the pizza, I asked them to over cook it so the pizza would be crispy. However, I guess my overcooked is different then theirs? Pizza was good, but I could only imagine how much better it would have been if it was cooked well done?  Workers their were great, and their service was very quick."}
{"text":"Best pizza west of the Hudson.  I am born and raised in New Jersey but left in 1992 for Minnesota. Now I live in Surprise AZ and was lucky to find  Ray's Pizza in Surprise, it was like stepping into a time machine from my youth.  Rays of Surprise appears to be family run and they speak more itialian than english, just like when I was a kid. Hand streached dough, not by a machine and cooked in a real oven, not on a conveyor belt.   Perfectly cooked, crispy but not burned. Not too thick, not to thin.   I tried another so called \"New York\" pizza place in town and found it worse than Dominios (if that's possible.)  I waited a long time to live by a pizza  place like this!"}
{"text":"The crust on the pizza I didn't like also I ordered the tyraki wings and BBQ. Which tasted burnt."}
{"text":"Is it the Ray's from New York? Doubtful. That being said, and for who anyone who knows anything about New York Pizza IN New York, there are a thousand \"Ray's\" and \"Famous Ray's\" and the like, and this could very well be one of them. It's not the most amazing pizza I've ever had, but it's far from the worst too. Pizza is such a subjective thing these days, and I truly feel that people have been too hard on this place.   Its really good New York style pizza. That sentence should tell you everything you need to know about the place. If that's not good enough for you, ok...then here's some more you should know:  The pizza is damn good, the service is damn good, and the prices are fair. Other than that, its pizza, ok? Good pizza. If I lived in the area, it would probably be my go-to for delivery (if they offer that, I don't remember). We live in AZ, people. Great NY pizza is hard to find, and this is some of the better stuff around."}
{"text":"I love their wings they are nice and meaty with good flavor.    Their sicilian style is super huge and yummy! I get extra cheese on mine.    The place is kept clean and has a nice pizza parlor appearance.   Service is with a smile and they are great for conversation also."}
{"text":"This is an ok place, but just kind of mediocre. Good to keep in your back pocket if you are looking for somewhere you haven't been too many times. However, it is not cheaper than other places where are demonstrably better."}
{"text":"hello once again we stop in to get a pizza  from our place we go because  it  feels like family there and we enjoy  going yum yum from movie mike"}
{"text":"Love this place, great pizza and wings,nice family, fast great service,will be back often"}
{"text":"Not the Rays I expected even though they claim to be from the New York Rays after yelling it to me...not by a long shot!"}
{"text":"We love Ray's the family run staff rocks, so great to get a smile and someone who remembers you simply by what you order! We are so very thankful to have a mom and pop local place to support for pizza!"}
{"text":"Was starving and popped in with my 8 year old on Sunday. It reminded me of my childhood in Queens, NY- I was able to pop in and get a slice. My daughter loved  the pizza, and it tasted as close to NY pizza as you can get in AZ. I wish there were some healthier options- maybe some nice salads or side dishes that are not fried, but the pizza was delish. My kid even wrote a note on our chalkboard at home to go back to Ray's Pizza. The guys were super nice also. I am glad it's right down the street!"}
{"text":"I am a bit disappointed by this place recently because part of their appeal to me is that they stay open later than any other decent place in the neighborhood. However on at least 3 occasions recently I tried to go here after 10 at night before 10:30 when they say they close and found a closed restaurant. Major bummer especially since on at least one of the occasions I would have stopped somewhere else on my way home if I had known Rays would not really be an option."}
{"text":"Solid lunch option that gets by more so on its budget friendly price then pizza.  Regardless, still the best slice in the neighborhood for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The classic \"sticks in your gut\", \"makes you want to take an afternoon nap\", guilt inducing pizza that everyone should indulge in every now and again.    Also, great value."}
{"text":"I've been eating Rays at multiple locations for 10+ years and have always had a great experience. You really can't go wrong with this place if your looking for NY style pie. They always have great deals as well!  This was my first experience at this location. You know your getting some authentic pie when you walk in and the employees are speaking Italian. The staff was very polite and respectful.   For $26, I got a large pepperoni and 20 hot wings! Thats an amazing deal! Pizza is always great, can be slightly greasy but that's typical with real cheese pizzas (I always dampen with a napkin). Wings are awesome as well! I always order them extra crispy, especially for take out."}
{"text":"Love this place love this place love this place!! This is my favorite AZ pizza place as close to NY as I've found here.  We eat here couple times a month and their pizza is fantastic and affordable!!  Staff is extremely pleasant as well!"}
{"text":"I have a horror story about this place  Although it was 5 years ago I will never forget it  I spent about $70 when I was there I ordered a large pizza chicken wings anti pasta and a sub  I had my order to go and as soon as i got home we opened the boxes and it look ok  So me my daughter my son and my wife sat down at the dinner table  And my daughter found a hair on the anti pasta salad So I told her to put the salad away And upon closer inspection I found that the pizza the chicken wings and the sub all had hair in it  So I thought this was no coincidence. but when I ordered I was very polite like always I gave no reason to do this to me  I was a paying customer I don't think there's any reason to do that to anyone!  So I packed up all the food put it in a big plastic bag and took it back to the Pizza Parlor  I told the manager what happened And as I was explaining there was a young guy in the back fixing pizza. And sure enough the hair length and color matched exactly like the ones I found on the pizza and the other food. No I'm not no forensic DNA tester but give the fact that all my family has black to light brown hair. And the hair found in the food was a lighter color kind of like a blonde almost with orange tones. He turned to me and the manager stepped into our conversation and said \"sorry we forgot to charge you for that\" referring to the hair!  He was very rude and I was right at my breaking point I was about to go postal and being from Arizona that little punk should have known that everyone is packing heat. But then I tried to come down it took every part of me to keep my composure.   The manager told me that there's nothing he can do about it he can't even replace my food. But at that point I wasn't even hungry anymore.  Ever since then I've been scared to eat at pizza places in surprise az thinking that that family might own it and history will repeat itself.  I can't tell you with anything taste like because we never tried it not even a bite  I have fantasies of slowly torturing that kid who told me those words even till today. Maybe one day I can punch him right in the mouth. And tell him that I forgot to charge him for that"}
{"text":"I have not really ever been a pizza eater but this place has changed my mind. From the melted cheese to the crafted dough life changing"}
{"text":"Well, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. When I pay $2.10 for a slice of pizza, I'm expecting an interesting challenge for my taste buds. But I didn't get that. It was very plain. Granted they made it fresh, but i suspect they used cheap ingredients.   When I got there, I noticed the dim lighting. I also noticed the lack of greeting even though there were 2 people behind the counter both of whom saw me when I came in. They have a flat screen which was showing basketball so I guess that's a plus.   I scanned the unorganized menu and discovered that they sell beer and full glasses of wine, which was cool. I didn't get the wine but if i ever go back there, ill definitely try it out.   So behind the counter, there were a couple of precooked pizzas one mushroom and one pepperoni. I asked the cashier if I could have a slice of each. She said 5 minutes. 15 minutes later I got my pizza. Although I was a little bit annoyed, I was impressed that they chose to make me a couple of fresh ones instead of the precooked slices.   So as you could imagine i was excited to taste fresh pizza. The slices were pretty big actually. And smelled pretty good too. The taste however wasn't special.   The peperoni slice was a little more greasy than normal. I got a sensation that the cheese was not all the way melted when I bit into it. You know when you take a bite of pizza that is well cooked and when you take a bite, a stran of melted cheese stretches between your mouth and the slice? Yeah, I didn't get that. Instead i bit it and it easily came apart. I noticed the same thing with the peperoni. I personally like my pepperoni to be slightly crunchy. This pepperoni was not. The sauce had very little flavor. But it did have a good texture. And last but not least, the crust was actually good. It was flaky and crumbled nicely in my mouth. And despite the higher amount of grease, the crust remained dry.   The mushroom pizza was the same except the mushrooms again, had very little flavor.   Overall it wasn't a bad pizza. It was New York style but most New York style pizza has a lot of flavor in it. These didn't Also the environment and customer service was sub-par. But, I would go back just for some wine. Also I want to try the wings. You never know when you discover a hidden wing gem."}
{"text":"I dropped in for lunch today.  I ordered a small salad and 12 wings which were both good.  The wings were good, hot, and cooked perfectly---I just wish they offered 6 wings instead of 12.  My salad looked fresh (sliced tomato, sliced white onion, green and black olives) but they did not have blue cheese dressing AT ALL.  I did not have the pizza---the reviews about the grease was disturbing and I know I cannot handle a bunch of grease.   Dining area was clean, it looked clean behind the counter, customer service was good and food was fresh --- keep in mind that I came around 1p-ish on a Wednesday so they were able to take their time with perfecting my order."}
{"text":"I ate here once a long time okay and it was just okay. I went today as a friend suggested we meet there but I have to say the pizza was actually pretty good.  We ordered 1/2 cheese and I had 1/2 pepperoni.  I'm not one that cares for sliced sausage so I went with the pepperoni.  I have to say it was a lot better than papa Murphy's and bjs on 56th that I have recently tried.  I think next time ill get it but bring it home.  Hope they will slice it in squares when I ask !  I will suggest thou if you have the time to order it freshly made"}
{"text":"Well, I was skeptical, but Rays actually makes a pretty good slice of 'Za!   This is my family's goto place for pizza because it's the closest to their house. We got a meat lovers and a cheese pizza, I'm guessing the largest sized pie because these pizzas were huge! You know what they say about enormous pizzas right? ... big slices!! lol I would probably ask for the slices to be double cut if I was ordering for myself but my family likes the big slices. Just know that when you look up the calories in a slice of pizza you probably need to double the number because these slices were the size of a Costco slice!   Now for the pizza quality review, no shortage in toppings!! The meat lovers had a 1 inch thick layer of meat covering the entire pie! I don't eat meat so I didn't try it but it looked good!   I had a slice of cheese, and at first, looking at the pizza I thought they didn't put much sauce on it and thought it wasn't going to be that good, but nope! Alas, my judgements were wrong because there definitely was plenty of sauce, it was just covered in a thick layer of ooey goey cheese! You know the kind of melty cheese that when you take a bite there are strings of cheese still connected to the pizza! Loved that it was still that hot and fresh! Haven't had take out pizza like that in a while!   Typically I go for a thinner New York pie. I know Rays calls itself New York pizza but it's really not quite New York style, that said, the 'za did not disappoint! I definitely recommend trying this place if you find yourself in the area!"}
{"text":"These guys are the best! Eager to please and the pizza is very authentic and they toss dough old school. Booths are a little cramped but manageable."}
{"text":"The owner should be embarrassed. I go in there at 9 pm and order wings and pizza. You can see the kitchen is shut down. The guy takes left over wings and tosses sauce on and puts in oven. The were bones! Pizza ok, then the guy mopping under my feet while I am trying to eat. Place still open and floors are soaking wet, looking for a lawsuit if someone slips. Close at 8 if employees want to go home that bad! I used to like that place, but no more."}
{"text":"This location was amazing. The pizza was fresh and the toppings were plentiful. Definitely worth the money!!"}
{"text":"Was recommended this place and have no regrets. Amazing from scratch food! If you haven't had Rays, you need to."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had since moving to Scottsdale. Service is quick & friendly. Pizza is top notch - you can grab a whole pie or get it by the slice. Great little spot to grab a bite while you're on the go or to hold court with all your friends. The white pizza and the margherita are my favorite 2 slice combo - throw in a drink and you got dinner for under $10. If you fancy a little appetizer the garlic knots are delicious. Given all the various choices for pizza in Scottsdale, this place is the one I'd chose every time."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and great service! Being from out of town this weekend is special and this was the perfect place to start our weekend!"}
{"text":"Sitting here eating thin toast \"pizza\" then doesn't bend. Try using a timer since when people ask for pepperoni you just add then reheat a cheese slice"}
{"text":"I'm a native New Yorker, born and raised in Queens, lived in Brooklyn, now retired in AZ.  I've been on a year long quest for NY style pizza since moving here and I finally found it. Hey, Rays isn't great pizza but it IS mom and pop NY pizza. As good as you could get at most corner pizzerias in, say, Queens or Brooklyn.  I wouldn't jump for joy if I found this place on Kings Highway. But in Surprise, it's a big deal. I'm just talking about a regular cheese pie. Who eats pizza with spinach? Yechhh. Anyway, loads of  quality cheese and  good sauce that slide off a hot slice if your not careful.  YESSS. And the wings ain't bad either."}
{"text":"This place THE BEST!!! The pizza is the best in the west valley. Wings are second to none and the customer service is the best of all. I come here at least once a week and I'm always greeted warmly."}
{"text":"This place has pretty awesome food.  Sadly, they lose a star because they keep increasing prices and the food isn't getting all that much better or changing.  The same people have owned it for a really long time though which is nice because the food and service are consistent.  They have a great lunch deal."}
{"text":"Leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered a large pizza.  It was litterally dripping with grease.  The crust was really hard (like the oven was probably too hot)  They only give you super thin paper plates; my husband cut right through his trying to cut a slice up for our son.  Limited choice of toppings.  The crust, sauce, and cheese had virtually no flavor.  However, the pepperoni is on the spicy side.  Staff was ok, not overly friendly or very helpful to the first time customer.  The bathroom was clean and that is what got them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Very nice people  good food at a good price   helpful and accommodating  Happy customers"}
{"text":"First time trying Rays Pizza, wings are so tiny my son commented the poor little birds weren't even given a chance to live. I tried breaded mushrooms, the batter was still raw,left them sitting on the table.Pizza was ok. But for the price I've had way better. Our cashier was so shook up the manager was yelling at everyone, very loud and nerve racking.Sure won't be going back."}
{"text":"On our way out of Staples we couldn't help but become enticed by the smell of fresh baked pizza.. following our noses we saw the window.. frickin nice! It reminded me of some of the Asian places in San Francisco where you can see before you buy.. so many wonderful looking pizzas..   Ordered 3 slices and had seat.. this place is immaculately clean, huge kudos!! Pizza, cheese, pepperoni and a slice of cheese Sicilian.. all were really good, not like amazing or anything but very solid. I like the fact that they had herbs, parm cheese and garlic powder to dust your slices with.   While I wouldn't go out of my way for Rays Pizza, Id certainly come back when in that neck of the woods."}
{"text":"So I'm a typical dumb american who's been to New York several times and then drives by Ray's and says \"HOLY CRAP, THERE'S A RAY'S PIZZA HERE!!!!!!\"   No.   Epic fail dumb American, See \"copying business practices\" in business ethics book.  I understand that Ray's Pizza in NYC is for the most part independent but,I'm not that impressed with \"Rays Pizza\" in AZ, I'm just....not.  I don't know if I'm getting my hopes up too high everytime I  pull up to the place or, if I'm just going when my pizza palate isn't at it's peak.  Either way, both times I've gone, I mean yeah I'm satisfied and all but a part of me says, Meh, I've had better.   The slices out front look delicious but just IMO fail to deliver the extraordinary cheese, greasy meats and crispy/chewy crust that all come with the NY pizza dining experience.  I guess it's okay, I just feel you can get a better slice from NYPD pizza or Joe's in old town."}
{"text":"I'd been craving pizza for a week straight when I just caved and ordered online from Ray's. It was pretty easy to just pick my pizza, set up a time to pick it up, and pay for it online. Yay!   I went with the white garden pizza which had tomato, spinach, garlic, and ricotta and the fried mushrooms and scheduled to pick it them a couple hours later, closer to dinner time. Dropped by around that time and was able to grab my order quickly, but was somewhat disappointed because the pizza was lukewarm. I only had a 5 minute drive in order to grab the food so I doubt it cooled significantly on my drive back, but that was a slight letdown. Lukewarmness aside, the pizza itself was delicious and I definitely gobbled up everything including the crust. The fried mushrooms were a super yummy appetizer as well!   Prices are decently fair and based on taste and distance, I will most likely hit this place up again! Drop by if you want some satisfying and delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Très bon spaghetti. Pain chaud et salade inclus. Vous en avez pour votre argent. Sandwiches très généreux et délicieux. Pas de luxe ici mais ce qui compte est dans l'assiette. Je recommande."}
{"text":"Turned out to be a great place for meeting up with all the running ladies I train with. Accommodating, a little dingy, friendly staff, reasonably priced, and a pretty delicious slice of pie."}
{"text":"I have ate at Rays a few times and each time I am not super impressed. It's know as a Scottsdale \"landmark\" and a pizza place that everyone loves but frankly I don't think their pizza is all that it's cracked out to be. I will admit that the size of slices are really nice and the flavor is pretty good. However it seems like the pizza's are never cooked enough so the cheese isn't fully melted and it's still pretty doughy. The worst part is the amount of grease on each pizza. The slices are so soggy because of the grease that when you go to take a bite all the cheese and toppings slid off and grease drips all over you. You need at least two napkins to dab off the grease before even attempting to eat a slice. Not a good idea if you are on a lunch break and don't have time to go home and change. Basically Rays is a place where I'll eat if I have to but I wouldn't chose to eat there on my own."}
{"text":"This place is so freakin good! I come here one a week to take home pizza. The pizza is so cheesy it's oh so good! Reminds of the good ol days of mom and pop pizza shops. The girl that usually takes my order is always pleasant and she rocks a sublime shirt so that a plus lol. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's looking for New York style pizza. Something in the cheese is so addicting. I haven't tried the rest of the food there but I'm pretty sure it's good. The service is pretty quick you wait about 10 to 15 minutes for a large cheese. But good food is not made a microwave speed. They have a great deal there were if you get two large pizzas you get a free 2liter pretty good if you ask me. I will definitely visit soon."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ and I wanted something authentic, New York style. Rays is right down the street from me and I pass by it all the time! I decided to try it. WOW! Blown away!!  I had a large pizza to share with my family. The food is major quality. Crust was crispy outside and sot inside. The Cheese was real good anf melted. The toppings were fresh. Probably some of the best pineapple I've had on pizza. Still crunchy like it was freshly sliced!!! The wings were cooked to perfection and mildly spicy. The Cannoli was awesome too!!!  Very high recommended if you want that real, new york style pizza. You wont go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious, staff are friendly, restuarant is clean and just like a delicious hole in the wall New York pizza place! Prices are decent, pizzas are huge and I can't wait to try the cheese cake!"}
{"text":"Pass this place up. Pizza was soggy, ingredients were canned. Wings were so small and vinegar tasting. I have 'Ray's Revenge'. I should call the Health Department."}
{"text":"The food here has really become a hit and miss. One day it will be fresh and taste good and the very next day you will get half burnt , old cheese , pizza. Ray the owner is also not very attentive. It seems that he makes it a chore to go out of his way and say hey when a customer walks in. There is one flat screen and it is always playing sports (great for sports fans) not so much for family and kids. The prices are pretty extravagant to for $8 for 12 wings I believe.  2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink is $5.75 plus .55 cents for every topping you want.  I'm hoping this place will up the quality of their ingredients and I will be able to come here again , until then off to gilbert for some real authentic and fresh New York style pizza!"}
{"text":"Always passed this place and finally got around to trying it. Got the white pizza with spinach and it definitely appeased my pizza appetite. Slices are huge and it was made fresh.   Walked in with some friends late one night to order for take out, the guys were cool and had our pizza out in no time. Especially recommended for drunk food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday, had one of the specials of 6 wings and a slice of pizza.  The pizza was fine, nothing special but good.  The wings were the tiniest wings I've ever seen - must have been quail or pigeon LOL.  The wings also were not crispy at all, definitely skip the wings here!   Service was friendly."}
{"text":"place looked like it had potential. $8 bucks for a slice, salad and drink! Not really a lunch special. Pizza is mediocre at best and salad comes pre wrapped and was soggy (salad bar would help)"}
{"text":"Best pizza place ever! We eat there every week. The guys are so friendly too. Like family. Again best pizza ever!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza ever. When you crave a good pizza and Rays is the only one that will suffice you know you're hooked. We love their wings too. Yum!! All around...."}
{"text":"Rays a locally owned family operated place that has been there since I can remember. I however am not a huge fan of this style pizza. That being said I still gave a 4 star review.   Ordered a large pie with pep and a order of wings. The pie was hand made fresh as can be, with a ton of cheese and pep. The wings were large and meaty with a great flavor. They came with a free 2 liter.. who doesn't love free.   The pizza was good, the crust was great. I wish the sauce had a flavor other then a hint of tomato, but that is my issue with Ny Pizza. Again the crust was great. I wish they had better ranch IE not Buttermilk.   I had the left overs just last night and it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. They make an excellent pizza. We love their Monster Pie cooked a little longer with a crispier crust. The staff is friendly with what looks to be brothers/cousins/uncles all working the magic behind the counter. Great sub sandwiches and the wings are also very good. It's got a great family feel and can get crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"We thought we'd try Ray's Pizza as they were one of the closest places to where we're staying and the pictures posted of their NY thin crust pizza looked amazing. And the pizza WAS amazing! Toppings were plentiful and big (particularly notable was the ham, mushrooms, and anchovies... mmmmm!)  Then there was the wings. Another win! \"Mild\" was more of a medium Buffalo which was perfect for me but just a little hot for the DW. The price while reasonable seemed a little bit higher than a nearby competitor, but the meal was better. We WILL be back and will be looking forward to trying some other items that we fully expect will be just as good."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and a antipasta salad to go. Got home, looked at the salad.. Welted lettuce like literally brown. See photo. The wings were tiny little over cooked bones.. Not enough sauce in the world could make them edible. And the pizza was just meh. Anyways, we drove back to Rays to swap out the wilted salad for something a little more green and get wings with meat on them.. When we talked to the manager and the owner, they were not apologetic for the repulsive food but instead chose to argue and insist that the food was \"fine\"! Really? If the food was fine, do you think we would have driven all the way back to swap them out? Wow."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza! Honest people working here too! I left my wallet there tonight and they kept it safe for me! Thanks rays!!"}
{"text":"Not good pizza. We ordered a large pizza from here tonight as we live down the street and wanted to try it. We will never be back. For $22 you get pizza with no taste that falls apart. Oh and the mushrooms are canned...gross"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I tried this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Quickly ran through the reviews before going in and decided to give it a shot.   The pizza...SO YUMMY! We are pizza fanatics and it takes a LOT to impress us but this was exactly what we were looking for. As new residents to the Phoenix metro area, I am happy to say we found a NY style pizza place we will frequent often. Not only is the pizza delicious (we had 1/2 sausage, 1/2 white pizza. LOVED both!), it is reasonably price, too.   The reason I'm only giving 4 out 5 stars is because, yes, the owner is a bit abrasive and cantankerous. He was irritated with the employees which made me feel a little bit uncomfortable. I wouldn't want to work for this man but I do love the pizza."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza, and to top it off the service is great. I believe it's a family owned business, which explains why the treat you like family. I have to have their pizza at least once a month. It's your traditional New York style pizza that is hard to find."}
{"text":"Like Ray's in NYC, if you are in a hurry you can grab a quick slice that gets reheated.   I like to order the whole pie.  The monster comes with a ton of toppings and is one mess of a pizza.  Love it."}
{"text":"Not a pleasant experience... I like to find the positive in most anything, but trying to do that for this location of 'Famous Ray's Pizza' is going to be a challenge.  We went in because Jared was craving a slice or two of pizza and we were headed north for the weekend.  At other pizza joints around town, you can literally walk in and choose your slice from the counter and it is ready to go... not the case here.  Jared ordered his slices and I ordered what I thought would be a grilled chicken salad.  Side note - Jared questioned the girl taking our orders about what kind of meats and cheeses they use for their sandwiches and she had no idea.  He wanted to hear 'Boar's Head,' but he got a clueless expression instead.  Anyways, back to our order...  Not only could he not choose his slice, but we waited a good 10 minutes for the slices and the salad... which would be ok if the food were good.  Unfortunately, the pizza was really greasy and the salad came with fried chicken (not grilled as I thought) and not only fried, but fried with a huge piece of hair inside it... GROSS!  Since I did say I try to find the positive, I will say that when we made the restaurant aware of the hair in the salad, they offered to replace it, give us a pizza, or give us our money back... I was surprised when Jared said \"it's ok, just remember us next time we're back.\"  I think he felt bad... needless to say, we will not be going back anytime soon - free pizza or not!"}
{"text":"After a long day at work,  i just wanted a quick bite to eat. I ordered a small order of plain chicken wings with hot sauce on the side and a small dinner salad. My husband and I split the dinner and it was the perfect portion. All the employee were so friendly and happy and the food came out relatively quickly. Their wings are the best,  hot and crispy! Glad to have a great pizza place right down the street!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a whim and glad we did! He had two slices of pepperoni added jalapeños, no complaints. I ordered a gluten free pepperoni pizza and it was amazing! Hands down best gluten free pizza I've had. I recently gave up on gluten free pizza and this restored my faith in it. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm only sad that I didn't know Ray's was even here until a few ago!!! This is as good as it gets if you are a pizza purist like me. All you need is a regular slice, just cheese. Yum..........."}
{"text":"Wasn't as great as I had hoped. It wasn't really anything having to do with the staff, they were really friendly and loved seeing a new face. The pizza and wings were good but I don't know, it just didn't stand out to me. I may have to try again and get an updated review."}
{"text":"The pizza here is great and I love their hot wings. But the one downside is the one asshat behind the counter. I keep wondering why I give then my money when some of their staff can be so out right rude. The plus side is at least the cashiers seem to be friendly."}
{"text":"Best wings in the state and awesome friendly staff.  I bring my family here all the time! -mike"}
{"text":"I live right down the street and every time I come in here it's nice to see familiar faces. Family owned and operated. Not once have I been disappointed with the service or food. Outstanding calzones and pizza definitely one of my favorite places to go. Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I gotta say this place had a warm vibe and friendly owner and awesome NEW YORK Pizza. First time here and don't have the time since I'm traveling alot but it's worth the drive and affordable prices."}
{"text":"Me and my 2 buddies were in town for Spring Training, looking for a place to grub one night. We Yelped around and found this place, glad we did! Ordered their wings and pizza special, they tossed the wings at our table and served us slices when the pizza came out! A great neighborhood, family owned place with good food and great prices! We'll be back next year!"}
{"text":"Wow this pizza is great! My son had 2 huge pieces of cheese pizza, I had a piece of sausage and mushroom, and my daughter had a salad, garlic knots, and soup along with drinks, and it was less then $20 for all of it. When we walked in there were 3 people waiting to take our order, which was  awesome because we didn't have to wait long at all for it to come out! To top it off they have super fast and free wifi! Great lunch! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is soggy especially the veggie. I have tried Ray's pizza a number of times and they still can't seem to master the veggie pizza.  My pizza was not fully cooked as you can see the raw dough when you remove the toppings. The bottom of the pizza was also wet and not crispy. Sorry Ray!"}
{"text":"If you want to be yelled at, rude to, and just plain insulted. Go here!  The owner of this pizzeria does not have customer service skills.   The pizza is pretty good."}
{"text":"I've tried their white pizza twice avid both times it was AMAZING! The slice was huge, the crust was thin and crispy, and the cheeses were perfectly melted. The second time I visited Ray's I left my purse behind! When I returned the next day to see if they had found it I was grateful to find that they had put it away safe and sound and tried to contact me. It's a small town pizzeria in a Mesa strip mall!!!   Now, I need to stop leaving my purse in restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Best place for pizza and also by far the best costumer service. I love stopping into Rays just to even say hi to the employees. They are amazing and the pizza is the best!"}
{"text":"Really great food at Ray's. I recommend to stop by and get a bite here. Menu has diversity with different items to choose from."}
{"text":"If you could give no stars I would...reheated cheese pizza which came out burnt greasy and flat...served on two paper plates hello what a waste and way to fill our land fills... Styrofoam cups for eating in yuck.. Coke drinker not a Pepsi supporter... Reuses seasoning jars for parmigiano cheese... Personal talk between employees could be heard not work related topics... All about personal lives on what you should do and not do..."}
{"text":"Back to rays again! Always super friendly, quick, and delicious.   I always make it a point to go here when coming to Arizona and it never disappoints.   Thanks again, guys!"}
{"text":"Truthfully this place is more like a 3.5 in terms of pizza. You get that east coast slice and a really good crust but not enough flavor. Also pizza is a little too well done(can't get that pizza fold because of this!) I strictly base my reviews off of cheese pizza only.   Mostly clean Fans blowing regardless of temperature outside Decent staff Oregano"}
{"text":"Great pizza! New York style with lots of flavor and the dough is higher quality than your standard pizza place. I used to eat here a lot when I was a teenager after hockey games and recently went back as an adult and it's just as good!"}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly and pleasant.  I had my son with me and they offered to cut his slice of pizza into more manageable bites for him.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome food at a great price.     The staff here is wonderful.  Every time I'm in. They are very friendly.   Love the wings here.  And the bread is super tasty.    Lived on this place when I moved into the neighborhood.   Be sure to give it a shot when you are near by."}
{"text":"Ray's has great pizza. I was born and raised on Brooklyn... so I think I an say safely that I know what a \"Ray's\" pizza should be like. And this place is pretty close.   I am NOT a fan of their chicken wings... sorry. I HATE chicken wings that sit on an inch of the wing sauce. I know some people do like it that way... I do not. Redendo's (down the street) has way better (crispy) wings.  Ray's does have a great variety of gourmet style pizza. Most is available in \"slice\" format. The prices are reasonable... if leaning towards the expensive side.   I like the pizza in the \"window\"... very reminiscent of my NYC days."}
{"text":"Knowing my love of pizza and my search for an AZ favorite, a co-worker highly recommended that I try Ray's.  Wanting to to see if the pizza was really as good as he claimed, I braved the never-ending strip mall/parking rodeo that houses this location and oh, I am so glad I did!  Walking up to the door, I nearly swooned over the beautiful aroma of baking crust, garlic and red sauce.  For me, it holds the same allure that \"new car smell\" holds for guys.    Inside is even better!  It is kind of a controlled chaos near the entry - lots going on but somehow it all works.  The guys behind the counter were taking orders, handing out food and working 5 ovens that I could see at the same time - very impressive!  Initially I was just going to try a slice, but decided I needed a whole pie all to myself!  It was ready quickly, and I am very proud of myself that I did not immediately rip the box open in the parking lot.  I managed to wait until I got home to savor the flavor!  Of course I went with the pepperoni and mushroom new place test combo and I was very happy.  Even reheated for lunch the next day, very tasty.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Like the food. Subs are great but wish the people behind the register and making the food would have better customer service. For being there as long as they have they should know the regulars names. A smile works wonders."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. I order here almost every Sunday, and they never disappoint. If you are looking for great wings, this is the place."}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza and Meatball Sandwich in Arizona.  Came out for mlb spring training.  Glad i stopped by this place.   Pizza dough was thin crispy, sauce was very flavorful,  New York style for sure.   Meatball sub was very flavorful and huge. I'm quite picky when it comes to pizza and meatball subs but without hesitation this place received a 5 star review.   We will be back during next years spring training if not sooner.."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!  Their staff is friendly, and fun!    They have amazing wings and pizza.  The large pizza is so big it doesn't actually fit in the box!  There is always enough for leftovers in the morning, and it's a treat!  I just wish they would deliver..."}
{"text":"Ok...taste was \"meet expectations\". If you're traveling on the 17, camping, out on lake for day then it's a decent pizza place. If you want to help out small business then do your duty and get some pizza. I thought the crust was crispy, portions good size, taste ok, service good.  And there's an older guy who was making pizza that day. I just got the feeling he was Ray. He should be retired and relaxing. He gave me a genuine, sincere thank you.  That's why I gave it the 4."}
{"text":"It may not be the nicest looking place in town but you can't beat Ray's pepperoni - delicious!  I've had better luck with whole pies vs the standalone slices; don't know why.  Maybe they've just been sitting out too long."}
{"text":"Decent pizza if you're in the area and are hungry. Vegetarian option (or two) under the heat lamp all the time. Beers!"}
{"text":"Definitely reminds me of thin NY slices with a bit of oil dripping off. Same experience here,......the first time i bragged and took someone here.....we got some old slices.......not good!  Been eating at that other pizza joint that starts with \"V\"ever since."}
{"text":"Ordered and picked up around 1030 pm and the food was surprisingly good for this time of night.  Pizza by the slice better than most places - the sausage was thin shaved and DELICIOUS.  Also got salad and hot wings.  Good, quick food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Horrible. Being Italian and from the east coast I am a snob when it comes to good italian food. This place was horrible. I had the baked ziti and antipasa. To much dressing on the salad and no sauce on the ziti."}
{"text":"With so many pizza places it's hard to find one that's a step up from the chain places.   Rays was actually really good. The wings, crispy. The pizza, cheesy. Fried mushrooms, crunchy and not over breaded.   My gripe was the steak special. I didn't like the addition of marinara to the Philly cheese steak, but the bread was crispy and the meat was sautéed nicely.    The staff was nice overall, and for the price, I'd happily return. Oh and the wait was not bad either."}
{"text":"When I think of pizza, I think of Ray's. Multiple family owned pizza shops, all the locations are great. The workers here are a pleasure and the prices are very reasonable. You won't get the scottsdale attitude here. Instead, you will get the authentic NY attitude. The ingredients here are of good quality. They are not stingy on the toppings and you better know what you want when you get to the counter! Thank you Bobby for creating this establishment 30+ years ago. Many more to come. I can't wait to satisfy my cravings when that pizza hits my tongue."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza and chicken wings are great too!  Being from NY, that is important to find this far west:). Ray's is aways our \"go to\" place for parties!  They guys are helpful and friendly. Once over the years we had a mistake and they were quick to make it right.  I just stopped in and grabbed some clean pizza boxes for our school's class project... Great customer service!  I'm proud to advertise during our school's Showcase night:)"}
{"text":"So, this is going to be honest and an unhappy review. I went in earlier this week lunchtime because I had to go to Staples and it was convenient. When I first got to the counter I was a little hesitant because I felt like I think I need to know what I want and do it quickly and be done just in case they are rushed. 2 friendly workers man and woman greeted me and took the order.got it then realized  what time it was and I had to leave to go back to work, so I asked for a to go box and then out of nowhere seemingly an owner or family member pops out from the back and looks at me but startled and ask me some question I could not  make out. He (older thin stressed man) asked me what i needed almost didn't want to say because I already spoke to and looked at the worker. His vibe he gave was already negative, and I said what I needed and then he answered my question with a question about what I ordered. I didn't see the point in that and I just repeated myself that I need a container, he proceeded to say well for you tell me the correct answer that I can give you what you want. And I said you didn't hear me the first time, and he responded with it's always my fault nobody else. I will not be returning. They need better salad greens instead of iceburg lettuce and that man could learn from his employees - be kind take the high road dude!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I been coming here for over 5 years best pizza!! Wings are really good too! This rays is the best been to the one 7th st and bell the other one on happy valley and i17 and for sure this is the best!!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Rays Pizza, been coming here for years, but they have tweaked their recipe and now have fresh mushrooms. So good, makes me hungry just writing this. The pizza crust is the best in the area, New York Style, chewy . . . but if you ask they can bake it more crispy. The prices are great, easily feed a family for less than any other place in the area. Nice cold beer, excellent family owned service you just do not get anywhere else. Must try place, catch your sports game there too on their big screen television."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Ray's Pizza. The sauce and toppings were flavorful and it was not too greasy. I did not experience \"Ray's Revenge\" as my in-laws said I might so Ray's is a win in my book."}
{"text":"Love this Mom and Pop pizza shop. High quality,  fresh ingredients, thin crust and reasonably priced. What more could we ask for? How about a delicious, fresh,  homemade tomato sauce spread abundantly throughout? Will return frequently for my pizza fixes! Thanks Rays!"}
{"text":"Ok.  It was a weekday, but compared to the other visits I've made to THIS VERY LOCATION, it was really a WEAKDAY.  Normally 10 pizzas to choose from; this day-3.    The employees I've come to know by sight were nowhere.  One slice, mushrooms and pepperoni: $4.63.  I think that's a lot.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  If a pizza pie is 8 slices, that's now a $30 pizza.  Chris Bianco doesn't charge that and I won't pay it.    Now, throw in the unfriendliness of all the fake Italians that work there, you got yourself a real loser.  Stay away from this dump.  The only worse Ray's is at 7th Ave and Bell."}
{"text":"I was dying for a slice. Not a whole pie, just a slice. At the time, this 59th Ave location was the closest.   Now, I got good news and I got bad news. The bad news is, this Rays is in a shopping center that is basically vacant. And it is desolate. The good news, THIS IS THE LAST RAYS THATS WORTHWHILE.   I got a slice with mushrooms, and was so deceivingly hot I burned my mouth badly. Damn pizza stuck to my mouth). Not their fault. Delicious pizza. $2.50 for the slice...beautiful.   And then I saw a Sicilian \"Monster Pie\" that looked UNBELIEVABLE. HUGE, full $25 and easily worth it!  I'm going back. Period."}
{"text":"The pizza is authentic NY Style.  The pizza is not cheap, but the quality is very good.  The stromboli is also good.  They serve pasta and sandwiches as well.  The staff is very friendly.  They make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Conveniently located, good food good prices friendly staff what more could one ask for"}
{"text":"Like the wings. The pizza is good and they? will double cut it which is perfect for parties. Eaten here a few times.  Good family nite spot that's reasonable? priced. Foldable slices for those who want it New York style"}
{"text":"Next time you're in the mood for pizza and you're in Scottsdale, look no further than Ray's Pizza.  I used to work across the street from this magnificent gem but unfortunately, I changed jobs and now work in Mesa.    New York style thin crust pizza seems to be hard to find, at least at this level.  I just moved to Arizona from Utah and in Utah, there's a small pizza place called Pie Hole that serves the best New York style thin crust pizza I have ever had, until now.    I have searched for a while for a good pizza that lived up to Pie Hole and Ray's has delivered.  They have various flavors that are standard in the pizza world but they make them better somehow.  I think it's that thin crust.    If you don't like thin crust, please don't knock this pizza before you try it, because it is incredible.  I ordered 3 slices because at Pie Hole that's what I normally did.  I would order 3 slices and call it good, but holy crap this place doesn't not joke with the size of pizza.  I ordered 3 slices and was full by my first bite into the 2nd slice.  If you go, order less and then buy more if you need to because that pizza is large and in charge.  It will fill you up.    I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and I'm itching a little for some good pizza again so maybe I'll have to travel up to North Scottsdale to cure this itch for good New York thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hawaiian pizza and hot wings. Very generous with the toppings making it a hearty pizza. I'm always skeptical with a delivery pizza place that offers wings, but was pleasantly surprised with the quality wings served. They had a little bit of crisp to them and a whole lot of flavor. Let's just say if my buddy Dan was here to try them and would've lost his god damn mind! Oh yep!!"}
{"text":"Normally I'd give a positive review. However, today is a bit different. I was the only customer in line, and the place didn't have close to 1/4 of the tables filled with customers. The order taking pizza guy grabbed a fresh hot pizza out of the oven to set out under their warming lamps. Each half of the pizza contained the exact ingredients I wanted for lunch. I asked to have one slice from each side of that nice hot pizza he just took out of the oven, he looked at me as I spoke, ignored me, and proceeded to give slices that had been sitting under the warming lamps for ....? I told the cashier lady and the manager who was standing right there, all the manager had to say was \"Oh don't worry all that pizza is fresh, I guarantee it\". Clearly, not one of the 3 staff members cared about what I wanted, only in pushing old pizza product from the warming lights and not the fresh pizza that was just made! I reluctantly ate the slices given to me only because of time. I mentioned to the cashier and the manager on the way out that next time they should probably give their customer the slices they asked for that were fresh out of the oven rather than giving them warmed up slices that were not really warmed up, YUCK!! It made me feel like a poor college student all over again. Which is not the expectation I had for this place. So much for the manager's \"Guarantee\".   Ray's Pizza- you just lost a customer for life!"}
{"text":"the location has been taken over by a new owner.   Great lunch specials   quick service we try to get here at least once a month.   Give the new guy a shot.   You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We recently tried Ray's, based upon the Yelp reviews. I had a Philly cheese steak sandwich and my wife a slice of pizza. Both delicious and reasonably priced. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, service is even better, love this place!  Bought 2 large pizzas with 20 wings together and comes to $25-30.  Love their wings, tho, in medium--and ask for a side of hot sauce if one of you wants it hotter.  Love this place--it's our new go-to pizza place!"}
{"text":"New York pizza, this is not! Where the crust wasn't soggy, it was tough and rubbery. Add that to canned mushrooms and frozen spinach (at least it tasted like frozen) and you've got one disappointing calzone. My husband, raised on New York-style pizza, was not impressed either. The only reason I'm not giving it only one star is because I was able to eat it."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the East Coast. Since I have moved to Arizona, it's been incredibly difficult to find good pizza. And by good pizza, I mean New York style pizza. (I enjoy Chicago-style pizza too, but love NY pizza!) I'm a picky eater too - I want the crust thin and crispy, the sauce herby and tomatoey, just the right amount of cheese, the Italian sausage flavorful but without heat and other toppings that are fresh. Thats exactly what you get here. This is NY pizza in AZ and I will be back! And this place is waaaaay better than Oregano's!!!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza purist, and admittedly, a total New York style pizza snob. Finding the right combination of flavor, crust, and format has been an ongoing struggle since leaving the east coast several years ago. I've lived in the south, the midwest, and now the southwest. Finding good NY style pizza has proven challenging time and again. Rustic style pizza seems a little easier, and while delicious, nothing beats a good slice of a perfect New York pie.   Yesterday we wandered into Ray's Pizza for the first time. It's a very casual atmosphere and I appreciated that they had a few beers (and some mediocre wine) to quench our thirst given how casual the atmosphere was.   The pizza was good. Not excellent, but good. The flavor of the pie was spot on though. In fact, I'd rate the flavor of the sauce and cheese as first-rate. The cheese was clearly good quality and the ingredients fresh. The crust was a little too thick and puffy. I'm told you can ask for it thinner but I'm always interested to see how a pizza place throws their dough without me asking for -- and typically never receiving -- a specific thickness or thinness.   So while Ray's didn't exactly meet my NY style pizza hankering, it came damn close. And in the epic struggle for the perfect pie this far from home, I'd take Ray's and be happy about it. Not to mention that the service was awesome and about the friendliest staff I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"First time having Ray's:  We ordered the pizza to be delivered and it was VERY GOOD!!  SO happily surprised after being so disappointed with other delivery pizza.  The portions are HUGE ! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm from the East Coast and I still long for that super thin - crispy bottom. (maybe ordered in the restaurant it would be crispy; that's usually the way it is).  BUT - for Arizona, this will do just fine :))    WINGS are super yummy too!! We ordered way too much than we needed because we're used to the sizes from other pizza places.  No complaints here.  We'll be back !"}
{"text":"I tried Ray's Pizza for the first time yesterday. The dining room was very spacious and clean. The pizza was tasty--- a little bit old, but I was there at 2:30 or so, so not a typical lunch or dinner time frame. All of the staff was friendly and professional except for the woman that rung us up. She was very unhappy looking and was wearing sweats. That was a little weird.   I'll definitely give them another try though."}
{"text":"Love there pizza, always good always fresh! This location is well maintained and the employees are very nice. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Love Rays pizza.  I love how the sausage is ground and on the pizza.  The sauce is good.. The wings are delicious. Want a good meal go to Rays."}
{"text":"yeah, here it comes.  Old fart forgot my slices...  I sat in the place for over 15 min before I went up to see what was up.  Guy looked at me like I was a ghost.  I am like, uhm, how much longer on the slices.  He said, 'Huh?  You ordered slices'????  I am like yes, 15 min ago..  Him - 'Oh, I am sorry, someone must have taken them'.   Not to bag on the guy too hard but he was totally lost.  Either way, got my slices and scoffed em down.  Funny thing is, as i was leaving, he said to me, 'next time you come back, slices are on me'.  I am like wha??  you forgot me and my slices and that was 15 min ago how are you gonna remember the next time i come in?? Anyways, I will be back cause I like their pizza but this time, thumbs down on the service."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to get pizza. The pizza is delicious and the wings are amazing. It's nice to walk into a place and know everyone there...a real neighborhood atmosphere. This is our feel good restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not disappointed with Ray's Pizza, I'm just not all that impressed either.  It probably doesn't help that when it comes to the battle of New York vs Chicago pizza, I'm Chicago all the way.  Ray's pizza is quite cheesy, the crust is very crunchy.  $2.50 for a generously cut slice (that's for cheese, toppings are extra) isn't too steep.  I had a slice of cheese and a slice of Pesto.  Both were good, just not anything amazing.  I can't say I've ever been to THE Ray's Pizza in New York (or any of the infinite number of other places in New York also called Ray's), so I can't compare if this is anything like the real New York pie.  There's nothing wrong with Ray's Pizza.  I just wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Rays Pizza and would normally rate it at a minimum of 4 plus stars. Although tonight something was different. The dough was not fresh and tasted old. Part was crunchy but the crust was clearly old therefore the outcome was thick and chewy. Very disappointing. Hopefully the resin was because it was late in the evening, although, seriously, that is not an acceptable excuse. Hopefully our next visit will be wonderful! If not, I'll be searching for a new pizza joint.  And so after writing this review....I slept on it and thought,....ok, if I were the owner, I would want to know if someone thought my pizza was off.  So, I called, not for a freebie, but because I was curious if the pizza dough recipe had changed or if maybe since we came late, the pizza dough was old.  Well, let me tell you, the phone conversation did not go well.  Nothing like an owner who just does not want to hear that something was not right!  I kept explaining how much I LOVE Ray's Pizza, but he just kept saying I should have brought it back so he could replace it or refund my money.  I told him I could bring what I had back/ almost 1/2 the pizza and then he said that was not enough....well, when you have pizza for 4 people...what do you expect...right.  Everyone takes a piece, and then someone complains......you know the drill. I explained to the owner again...I did not expect him to replace the pizza, but thought he would want to know.  His ending comment to me was.....\"there is nothing wrong with  my pizza. He said....I take great pride in making my pizza...and no one else has  complained today, so you are wrong!\"  so sadly....my voice was not heard. What a HUGE EGO this guy has...so sad to know he is so close minded to hear an honest customer trying to help him out!   I might need to sit back and think twice if I want to return to Ray's Pizza.   Hey, can anyone recommend a fabulous NY Pizza place in North Scottsdale? I am shopping for a new place!"}
{"text":"There won't be any issues with me comparing Ray's to NY places since I'm a Texas girl through and through.  But don't think being a country bumpkin disqualifies me from knowing good pizza when it's crammed into my talkhole.  It was surprising at first how easy it can be to find a droolworthy pie here in Arizona, and in some ways we are spoiled for choice from a few great places.  Ray's stands out in a few ways.  Before I even mention the pizza, I'll show some love for the simple online ordering rig.  Call it anti-social if you want, but there's just something to being able to order without having to shout down the phone to each other. Pickup was a breeze, parking was abundant and I was in and out in no time flat.  I braved the tortuous drive home with that box of deliciousness filling my car with some of the best smells... And it was worth every centimeter of that drive.  I ordered the Sicilian thick crust with plain cheese.  The dough was like a heavenly little pillow wrapped in a snug blanket of flavorful sauce and cheese.  Oh so.much.cheese... Ahh, a pizza maker after my own heart.  Needless to say, I will be returning.  And if I can tear myself away from that temptress that is the Sicilian thick crust, I'd love to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Wow, great service, great pizza and sandwiches, we love this place.  Definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Called this location on a Friday night at 11:10pm (they are open til 11:30pm) to order one pizza for us to pick up (we were 5 mins away). The extremely rude man who answered the phone when we went to order stated \"well we close in like 10 minutes...\" So my fiancé asked \"so does this mean we can't order anything?\" And the man was so rude. If you don't wanna make pizza and be open until 11:30, I think it would be a great idea to close earlier. If you're open, maybe you should make some freaking pizza!! Ugh!!  Also, whoever the heck answered the phone needs to learn about a little thing called customer service."}
{"text":"We were out doing some work in Deer Valley and were hungry for some wings. Ray's Pizza popped up so we decided to check it out. Ordered wings and a couple slices of pizza. We were very impressed with the pizza, crispy with great flavor. The wings were finger-licking good! If we lived closer, we'd be regulars at this spot!"}
{"text":"I think this was one of my worst experiences in an eatery so far. I went to Ray's pizza after reading the reviews on this website. I was planning on having a pizza party and wanted to impress everybody. I went there a few days before to sample the pizza beforehand, and I am glad I did it.  Once you get there, there are multiple boards and handwritten signs where prices are displayed making it very confusing for the customers. We couldn't figure out what we wanted and how much was going to cost us. The bitter old lady at the counter did not even greet us, and gave us attitude. She finally showed us a printed menu, which had updated handwritten prices all over it. I kept saying to myself, they make very good pizza so anything we order is going to be fantastic. We decided on veggie pizza and white pizza, and then she said they don't sell white pizza by the slice and I changed it to mushrooms and ham. The printed menu said a slice of pizza was $2.50 but our total was going to be over $8.00. So we said, \"Wait a minute\". Then she explained that the base is a slice of cheese pizza that they charge $2.50 for, and then any extra toppings are $0.50 each. I looked at the menu and showed her: \"pizza slice\" is $2.50 , not \"cheese pizza slice\". And she didn't care. We both ordered a slice of pizza with a couple of toppings each, and we waited patiently at the table. Anyone who has children knows how difficult it is to control little ones in a restaurant. My 18 months son started to play with the salt & pepper shaker and napkins holder, and I was glad he was at least sitting at the table, and I did not have to run around after him. Well, surprise, surprise!! The bitter old lady came to our table and grabbed the shakers and the napkins holder from him and moved them on a different one. How rude is that? I mean, have you ever seen such bad customer service anywhere? Just plain rude! Later we got called at the counter to get our pizzas. The slices were very big, and they were placed on two single-use foam plates. My pizza looked like a pile of ham and mushrooms, on a top of a cheese pizza. They literally stick to the menu; you could see the base, tomatoes and then the grilled cheese under the toppings. Ham slices were covering the cheese pizza, on top of the ham there were huge slices of canned mushrooms, and not a bit of cheese on top of it. My pizza base was a little warm; the toppings were almost cold, without any sign that they were placed in the oven. My husband had a Mediterranean (or veggie) slice and it was just a pile of raw vegetables, with a sprinkle of cheese. I mean, they were all raw: onions, peppers, olives, tomatoes. I tasted it and the veggie one tasted better than my pizza. I could not finish mine because it did not taste like pizza at all, and the taste of cheap ham and canned mushrooms was just horrible. We left the place very disappointed by the customer service and especially by the food. I am glad we sampled before embarrassing me at a pizza party. Don't go to Ray's Pizza because they overcharge and whatever they serve is not called pizza. Bad food and bad customer service doesn't have room in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Yep. Always good.  Did slices again today, instead of ordering a whole pie. Reallly good. Dare I say as good as a whole pie?  My ONLY complaint,  and I've resisted the urge to say this before, is the napkins. I really hate those cheap napkins. A good place deserves good napkins. I'm messy and I know it!  PS- thank you for always having football on when we come, it appears Sunday is our Ray's day."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings weren't bad and the service wasn't bad either. However being from NY I can't find something in the west side close enough to a authentic delicious pizza. But I'll go to rays any day of the week instead of dominoes or papa johns"}
{"text":"They have pretty good pizza but I really come here for the wings (extra crispy) They are very affordable."}
{"text":"Started getting pizza here after moving to the area and sometimes it was good, other times, I felt that the pizza had way too much cheese and was too salty. Recently, we ordered more items including, pizza, chicken parm sandwich, cold roast beef sandwich, and mozz sticks. The pizza was cold, not cooked enough, very heavy, too much cheese. The chicken parm barely had any chicken on it, chicken tasted frozen, def not fresh, bread was so soggy, too much sauce. The sauce is horrible. It didn't taste fresh at all, was very dark red, salty, either cooked way too long, or had too many spices in it. The roast beef sub was gross, roast beef was gray and rubbery, not good quality meat, asked for extra oil and vinegar, and sandwich was drenched in olive oil. The mozz sticks were not fresh at all and as hard as a rock. Will NEVER give them my business again. Total waste of money and nothing at all like NY style pizza or food. (59th Ave location)"}
{"text":"So my family and i where looking to eat some good pizza. We found Rays on Google and we decided to eat there. I must say that it is not what i expected. When we got there we where greeted by a cute young lady and a young man with a New York accent. The whole atmosphere was something i would expect if i was eating in New York. It was awesome and we loved it. Now half of my family is Sicilian and i love their food. The young man behind the counter suggested the monster pizza Sicilian style.  We ended up getting the pizza and hot wings with our dinner. The bread on the pizza was nice and fluffy and it didn't overwelm you like some other deep dish pizzas. It reminded my a lot of my cousin Trevors pizza. The sauce was not to sweet and they didn't put a lot of it on the pizza. I recommend this pizza joint to anyone who wants a true New York Style Pizza. I will be back to try their  Calzones."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying ray's and I have to say I am completely pleased! The service was so friendly the food was delicious and pretty inexpensive. The pizza and wings are great. The cook was very interactive and energetic! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very yummy pizza! Had the large Monster one . One slice of that is enough for me. My bf had 2 slices and some hot wings and was very filling for him. Wings are good too. The only thing I didn't like about Rays is it's too pricey. $20. For large monster pizza and $8 for 12 wings :-O but other than that it's worth trying it out. I definitely will be coming back. Oh and the crust is delist!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are vacationing with some friends here is Arizona and on our first night we were looking for some pizza. We found the BEST pizza ever at Rays. It is family owned and they were amazing!!We have eaten pizza in Italy and this pizza was as good as any we had while overseas. Truly authentic taste with awesome service. If the opportunity arises we will be back!"}
{"text":"I've never been here before but it was close to my work and I decided to give it a try. It's a pretty small place but it was clean, the staff was friendly, it seems family owned. I ordered the special steak sandwich and a regular drink it was a little over $10 bucks but the sandwich is pretty big but does not come with any sides not that you need sides it's pretty filling. I wouldn't say it was great, but it was not bad, I felt like it lacked flavor but it could be that I have a favorite elsewhere and this just doesn't come close. I did see they have lunch specials on their pizza but honestly I saw the pizza and that's why I opted for the sandwich, wasn't very appealing IMO."}
{"text":"First of all let me say that My family & I love rays pizza so this pains me to write. I ordered over the phone & got 2 medium pizzas & 24 wings. When I asked for the total the guy on the phone hung up. When i got to the store he told me my total was $60. I simply asked him to review the receipt and go over why it was so expensive. His response was \"you go to mcdonalds & buy burgers & its $30\" rather than just giving me a receipt. My family & i used to be regulars at this location but after this experience we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Good customer service!  A variety of yummy food in the menu and the pizza is pretty authentic."}
{"text":"At first they stated they could not deliver to me and I cancelled the order they call back and stated they will deliver to me, so that changed my review I hope the food is Great that is what you call customer service"}
{"text":"Love Rays pizza.  They are always really nice when you go in.  James at the Carefree Hwy & 7th Street store is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very good New York style pizza. My third favorite in AZ behind Red Devil and Times square. The spinach and tomato pizza was really good this time but can be a bit inconsistent. sometimes big chunks spaced far apart and sliced tomatoes and sometimes diced tomatoes and small pieces of spinach all over. Overall more good than bad but be prepared to spend 50.00 for two large pizzas."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch one afternoon. Ordered two slices and a drink. It took the older gentleman behind the counter a few minutes to pry himself away from what he was doing to tell the kid in back to come take my order.  The pizza was barely edible. One slice was stiff as a board. You could hold it at the point and it stayed straight. The other slice was sloppier than a wet noodle and on the borderline of being raw.  Horrible. I will not be back and I would not recommend them to anybody."}
{"text":"The service is great but I wish the pizza was more like their location on 35th avenue! It might be due to the other one being family owned but it just seemed like slightly smaller proportions but still a great value! 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"We still enjoy the food, e.g., pizza, spaghetti and lasagna dinners, but often they mess up our take out orders with missing items."}
{"text":"Boy, I wouldn't suggest this place. First, it was warm inside, AC not working right. Second, the beer wasn't ice cold.  Third, the dough on the pizza wasn't raised right at all...it was like eating wet cardboard that's baked on the bottom.  This is the heaviest pizza I've ever eaten. Then the cheese was almost tasteless and the green pepper were clearly not fresh at all...they even had a cucumber taste to them.  And finally, it turned my stomach and I had issues if you know what I mean. Never again.  Sorry Ray!"}
{"text":"The food gets 4 stars, but they lose 2 stars for LOUSY service.  The pizza is pretty good NY style pizza.  The crust is cooked just the right amount, just a little crispy on the bottom and the perfect consistency to eat folded.  Because we are a family of five we tend to buy a whole pizza rather than by the slice.    Wings were also good and very saucy.  We got the mediums, and they were just the right amount of spicy for everyone to enjoy.  They had a deal for a large pizza and 25 wings for $22.  Watch out, though, because the drinks are $2.50 each, so with a family of five we paid over $12 just for the drinks!  Dining room and restrooms were both clean.  Unfortunately, what detracts from the Ray's Pizza experience is the service.  The service SUCKS.  We were told we would get the wings first, and then our pizza would come out.  They yell out to you from the counter when your order is ready, but you cannot understand what they are yelling out.  I kept checking to see if our wings were ready every time someone yelled.  After about 15 minutes, I went to the counter to ask about the wings.  They told me they take a while to cook.  (Huh?)  Finally, they called out our pizza order; still no wings.  I again asked about the wings and the man behind the counter said they would bring them to us.    We started eating the pizza and when the wings finally came they were COLD, like they came out of the refrigerator.  Even the plate they were on was cold.  I hate sending food back, but I carried them up to the counter and gave them back to be heated up.  The girl who was at the counter look perplexed when I told her the wings were cold, like she did not know what to do.  The man working the pizza ovens, though, took them and said he would heat them up and bring them out to us.  10 minutes later, we were finally eating our wings.  The service problem is not so much in the screw-up.  I am a forgiving person and mistakes happen.  The service problem is in the attitude  of the people who work there.  Just a rude and abrupt demeanor.  You are not a guest in there restaurant, they are doing you a favor.    It's too bad that bad service detracts so much from good food."}
{"text":"Crispy crust and decent toppings on Ray's pizza slices.  Really inexpensive which was great with me since I had to wait around for a meeting in Scottsdale the day that I went to Ray's.  The owners were there helping the busy lunch crowd.  The pizza choices are set out and the slices are pre-baked.  Once you order, they slide the slices back into the oven and it does come out perfect!  Ray's is clean and spacious, great for lunch with or without kids."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint in the valley!  Consistency and friendly service pay off.  My family has been eating at Ray's for a number of years, and I have tried most of them in the north valley.  I keep coming back here because they are the best.  The 2 brothers that run this location are the best.  They are friendly, welcoming, and go out of their way to make their customers happy.  I once asked them about their pizzas.  I have eaten a lot of pizza there, and I have never had a bad one; I also have never seen a bad looking pizza there (the crust is always uniform, about 1/3 to 1/2 inch. always.)  The answer was simple.  I was told that one, if not both of them are always there; and they look at every pizza before it leaves the kitchen.  When they are busy, I love watching their crew work together; I wish all restaurants took this kind of care with their food and strived to put out a quality product.  Both the Neapolitan and Sicilian pizzas are great; but if you order the Sicilian, you will have a lot of pizza (not that this is a bad thing!).  The chicken wings are like the wings at almost every other place, deep fried with the usual choice of sauces.  They are always fresh though, just cooked, and we have never had the \"old oil\" taste that you sometimes get at other restaurants.  Dinners (spaghetti, chicken parm, etc...) are also available.  They all come with salad, bread and real butter.  I like the spaghetti and meat balls; nothing fancy, but tasty and comforting.  My wife likes the chicken parm dinner, a generous amount of chicken with sauce and cheese, plus a side of spaghetti, plus the aforementioned salad and bread.  This Ray's is over 20 miles from our house, and we have to drive by 2 other Ray's to come here.  All I can say is that it's worth the drive.  Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Do not order online.  I went through their website, my card was charged and no store had the order despite charging my card.  Deer Valley location manager told me \" I don't know what you want me to do, I don't have the order. Call your credit card and disputed the charge\".   Major hassle!!!!"}
{"text":"Native New Yorker.  This is what good New York pizza tastes like."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza! We ordered the monster pizza and it was literally a preheated pepperoni and cheese with all of the works added afterward and reheated. Very disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"This Ray's location is great when you just want to grab a slice and maybe enjoy a beer after a long day of work. The place seems to be family run and they are always friendly and helpful. The food is good and comforting. I enjoy coming here for a relaxed and friendly atmosphere with tasty food to enjoy."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Ray's Pizza, as I recently moved here from NYC and was missing the pizza terribly.  Unfortunately, this pizza reminded me more of Pizza Hut than even the worst pizza place in Brooklyn. NY pizza requires a sweeter crust, doughy but still crispy on the bottom, and sause with actual flavor. This crust was like cardboard. You couldn't fold the pizza because the crust was so dry that it broke if you bent it at all. The sauce was bland and was missing all of the flavors you would expect from a good slice. I don't even want to talk about the cheese but I will. It was probably kraft cheese. It tasted like nothing and didn't move.   Also, the service is bad. I get it that New Yorkers have attitude... but it wasnt the attitude that was wrong. It was that they forgot to put our pizza in the oven when we ordered it. We had to remind them that the pizza sitting on the counter should go in the oven so that it would eventially come out of the oven and end up on our table.  Maybe we should have just left it behind the counter after all..."}
{"text":"Born and raised in NY. Transplanted to AZ via NJ two years ago. About as close to NY/NJ pizza you'll get in the area. All food is delicious. The white pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"Not my favorite, but definitely not the worst.  I have been coming here since high school many many moons ago. This place is fairly consistent on their pizza. Get it by the slice or by the pie. They also offer calzones and a few other pasta dishes. They are definitely the next option if you are done with the big chains and you want a more homestyle made pie, but they lack the flavor of places like barros and spinatos. Like I said, still not a bad pizza joint if you just wanna drop in somewhere and grab a slice. Not too expensive either so I feel like it really is a must visit."}
{"text":"Thought I would give them a 2nd chance... Bad idea! Employees make you feel like your putting them out for ordering overpriced pizza. this place will be out of business If  the owners don't  make a change quickly."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great wings, I dare you to find a nicer couple of guys anywhere than the owners here.  Ray's is about as Arizona as cactus and rattlesnakes and after nearly 35 years of eating this brand, it still is just about untouchable- top 5 in the state, time after time."}
{"text":"Authentic NY pizza?  Well...it's closer than any other pizzas I've tried in the Phoenix area.  And the owner, well, you can definitely tell he's from NY. :)  We heard rumors about this place being every bit as good as the original Ray's Pizza in NY, and that's quite a claim.  While I can't say it's as good (because seriously, what can beat the real thing?) it's pretty good.  We tried the plain cheese because in my opinion, that's how you can tell if it's good pizza.  The crust was thin, and if it had just a liiiitle bit more flavor, it would have been perfect.  But still, good.  I enjoyed the sauce a lot, but there was just a tad too much cheese on our pizza.  Overall, I'd try it again.  Oh, but the cannoli?  That was awesome. :)"}
{"text":"This is NOT authentic NY pizza for a few reasons:  1. The cheese is too thick 2.  The crust is too thick 3. The taste is rather bland  Real NY pizza has that certain something that's in the crust that really makes it memorable and the cheese is not lopped on there.   I will say however I liked the cheese to sauce ratio. A lot of mediocre places don't do enough sauce but this place did better than average.   About the name:  the pizza box says \"Famous Rays\". I guess they are trying to emulate all of the Rays, Famous Rays, Famous Original Rays etc in NYC. Lame.   I should have known better. Next time I come back to Glendale (here for Spring Training) I'll stick with Mexican."}
{"text":"We love this pizza place they are super welcoming and very friendly ! Love the Italian accents it's nice to get a pizza pie from people who are actually Italian the pizza is some of the best pizza we have ever had and the pasta is the best, their Italian salad is a must have."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and ordered pizza and wings from here the other night. Overall, I thought it was a good value as we paid about $25 for 20 wings a a large pizza.   Growing up in upstate NY and having lived in Chicago and now Phoenix the past 3 and a half years I have had a hard time finding actually good chicken wings. These were the best wings I have had outside of upstate NY - A medium wing was actually medium. My only complaint is that they provide ranch instead of blue cheese and no celery. Additionally, if you like crispy wings I would ask them to leave them in the deep fryer an extra 2-3 mins.  Next, I really enjoyed the pizza. Although it's not as thin as I typically like (it could be if they turned their 17' pie into a 20') the flavor was awesome. One thing I would suggest doing is asking for the pizza to be well done to get a little more crisp from the crust.  Overall my wife and I really enjoyed the pizza and wings and Rays will more than likely be our go to pizza at our new place."}
{"text":"I always visit Rays pizza whenever i am around. Pizza is delicious. No questions about that.  My only complain is the price. A slice of pizza with 2 toppings costs almost $5 including tax. You couldn't get an entire pizza for another $2-3 at regular pizza places.  They should atleast provide some discounts or coupons for regular customers like me ;)"}
{"text":"Great NY-style.  Grew up in Bklyn and love this stuff."}
{"text":"Was a good slice of cheese.  Nice crust. Only negative was a bit greasy. Service quick nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Pizza Not!! the best has a doughy taste so gross and super oily and to top it off the Girl that works there has a nasty Attitude answering the phone like what do you want! Wtf bitch!!!  what I want is for you to get some fucking customer service!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Ray's Pizza in Manhattan many times no comparison to the Surprise location. I wonder if anyone here ever worked in NY.  Ordered a thin crust pizza and the pizza they served was 3/4 to an inch thick and when I mentioned is this thin crust she said you could have ordered extra thin, not listed on the menu. Then like someone else mentioned in reviews you get dirty looks instead of an apology."}
{"text":"Pizza is yummy, eggplant parm sandwich is super delicious. We live around the corner and order all the time."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work so I stopped for lunch, let me just say the wings and pizza are delish!  Great lunch specials .... definitely worth a try.  I got the \"hot\" wings and they were perfect, not to spicy."}
{"text":"No one can beat the mushroom and sausage pizza or pepperoni and mushroom!! Love it all !!!"}
{"text":"Nice crust but not much flavor. The best by the slice was the sausage. The pepperoni tasted a little like it was frozen meat that might have changed the flavor a bit.  I would have given 5stars but the wine choice tasted like cheap boxed white wine.   A pizza place should always have at least one good red and white even if they charge a bit more. That's my suggestion."}
{"text":"Ordered a pick up and was nothing like we get in the past...from the crust, sauce and toppings very disappointed...may have to consider another Rays...I called them and inquired her answer was nothing changed...not satisfied!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ray's for years.  As an ex-New Yorker it was a treat to find such a good NY Pizzeria in Glendale.  I visit a couple of times a year and the quality of the pizza has remained consistent for several decades.  Compared to prices in the Bay Area and elsewhere in California, maybe even New York, the price for a large pie is very cheap ($12 or 13)."}
{"text":"Rays pizza....what can I say other than AMAZING pizza! Everything about rays is delicious.  I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have always left satisfied! You couldn't ask for a better pizzeria!  Staff is extremely friendly!  If you are looking to satisfy your taste buds then make sure you stop in at Rays. This is a new favorite spot for me!"}
{"text":"Rays is the stuff. Love the crust! Pizza by the slice yippie!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Rays pizza? I remember back in the day every Friday it was a family tradition that we order the deep dish pizza from here. The guys that worked there 10 years ago still work here now. They're genuine and never a disappointment. Their pizza always tastes wonderful and is so fresh always!"}
{"text":"Driving around looking for pizza, came across this place. The by the slice options weren't fantastic although to the stores defense it is later on a Sunday night. I must say the people working the register, I'm thinking the owner? Was very very grumpy. I had a question but could hardly imagine having asked it since he looked like he would ask me to leave if I didn't do what I supposed to. Pay and walk away. The pizza, very over priced for by the slice and was - even though heated up again in the oven very soggy, greasy and lifeless in the flavor department. Hey you never know until you try it right? Skipping in the future, not really any reasons to come back other than convenient hours."}
{"text":"Short and sweet, nothing fancy. Ray's is simply one of the best little pizzerias in the valley to grab a slice of New York style pie. Great for lunch, very casual."}
{"text":"I have been a Ray's Pizza fan for at least 20 years! The service is great, the Peroni's are refreshing and the pizza is the closest to New York style one can get in the valley. I am a fan of the Chicken Alfredo pizza...add jalapeños!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a coworker from New York. He said it is so close to New York pizza it's unbelievable. We have a large cheese. Which was more like a extra extra large cheese due to must restaurant standards. It was good, greasy. Reminded me of the pizza they use to serve in grade school. I won't mind eatting here again. Just not something I would write home about."}
{"text":"I was not really impressed. We have been looking for a new pizza place and we have them a shot. The pizza was subpar. The fried mushrooms had a strange taste. The booths were very small and this is one of the first times I did not finish my wings. The staff was nice, but a bit creepy, they kept staring at us since we walked in the door and not in a \"how may I help you\" way. I blame the proximity of this location for its bland pizza, sun city residents don't like salt."}
{"text":"The Good: - One of the best crusts we've ever had.  Perfectly cooked with a light crunch, but still soft.  Also plenty of flavor.   - Fair prices on everything.  - Good choice of appetizers/sides.  The Bad: - One of the greasiest pizzas I've ever had.  We ordered a pepperoni and that can sometimes be a bit greasy, but this was significantly worse than other places.  We're hoping this was a fluke.    The Nit Picky: - Terrible cheap napkins.  I'm a sucker for a place with good napkins.  It is sad how many places cheap out on the napkins these days.  This normally isn't anything more than a minor annoyance, but when the food is super greasy, you need a way to clean up.  We probably went through 20 napkins between three of us just to keep the grease off our chins.    I'm sure we'll go back to give Ray's another try.  There are some great looking pictures from other Yelpers that make me look forward to trying the wings!"}
{"text":"Ray's Pizza is a little restaurant where you seat yourself and order at the counter.   The man who I assume must be Ray speaks with a heavy Italian accent and is a little feisty.  If you aren't listening when he calls out your pizza order, he just may give it to someone else and make you wait while another order is cooked up for you.   Kinda funny.   But the pizza is worth the wait. It's delicious. You can order by the slice and they're huge. A slice of cheese pizza is only $2 and their specialty slices are a little more.   You can also buy whole pizzas, pasta and cannolis. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ray's is really good pizza. I am italian and my dad is from central italy so I have high standards for pizza, and ray's is definitely legit."}
{"text":"I'm utterly confused by the four and five star ratings of this place. Those people that use adjectives like \"wow\" and \"best pizza ever,\" aren't from anywhere near the east coast or New York. I, on the other hand, AM from New York. Was born and raised there, and I know good pizza when I eat it. Ray's, I'm sorry to say, is not authentic.  Now, to be fair, I didn't order a slice. I decided to go with something a little heartier, like a chicken parm sub. But let me back up a moment. I have to echo some of my fellow reviewers about the service in this place. The two girls running the front counter looked as though they were working a funeral parlor and not a pizza place. No smiles. No hellos. It was quite depressing, actually. I even mentioned to one of the girls who brought me my food that she should lighten up and smile. She cracked a shy grin and told me that she was sorry and that it was \"too early.\" A customer doesn't give a rat's ass how early it is (It was 1pm!) Your front counter is like a receptionist in an office. They are the face of the business. They set the tone of the whole experience. If you can't get that right then the customer won't come back. With my sub I ordered a side salad. I paid and walked over to my table to wait.  The food came out in pretty good time. I didn't feel like I'd been waiting long. The salad was pretty standard stuff: iceberg lettuce, a couple of tomato slices, olives and a few croutons thrown in for good measure. The Italian dressing tasted like it came from a bottle; it definitely wasn't home made. I give the salad a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.   Ok, on to the chicken parm sub. It was pretty massive, but that's about the only good thing I have to say. I mean, it was just \"okay.\" I'd tell you what the sauce tasted like but they barely put any on, which in the end, made the whole thing way too dry. The bread was nice and crisp on the outside and doughy on the inside, but the chicken cutlet didn't taste like it was made in house. I have my suspicions that it was pre-packaged frozen cutlets; it was way too salty and very dry. It just tasted mass produced. The whole thing was smothered in cheese that could have stood to be melted a little more. It was a consistency that was half melted and half not, kind of rubbery. I give the sub a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  All in all, between the depressing front counter and the lackluster food, you won't find me going back to this place. Authentic New York style pizza places don't have to promote the fact that they are authentic, like Ray's does. (They use the word in their advertising.) I'm sure there are other pizza joints that are more \"authentic.\"  When I find one, I'll let ya know."}
{"text":"Great food and even better people.   I would come back just for the friendly service.   My go to place for wings! Best wings in town.   Pizza is great. Subs are great. Pasta is great!  Did I mention the people???   Feels like you are ordering food from your best buds.   I might just have to invite them over for a BBQ soon....  Rays on Deer Valley Rocks."}
{"text":"The Pizza & Wings Special is great, and good NY pizza-by-the-slice."}
{"text":"Steak special looked really good. Couldnt wait 30 minutes though so i walked out. Yes paid and out $10 for nothing but thats how upset i was. Never again. $10.69 to be exact. Maybe they'll be nice and credit my card back without me asking and i might give it another shot"}
{"text":"Service was very good! Pizza was smoking hot and delicious! What more could you ask for!? Really enjoyed it for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good. We had a large half-cheese half pep and sausage plus a dozen hot wings.   The wings? Horrible. They were very small, NOT very hot even though they were ordered as hot. But the worst was they had an \"off\" taste to them. Not sure if they were spoiled or what but I ate one and threw the rest away.   Sorry but I can't give more than 2 stars.  I can't really comment on the service too much. My togo order was taken over the phone by a pleasant gentleman and I sent my daughter to pick up."}
{"text":"This is definitely a family owned atmosphere. The employees are genuinely kind. Their pizza is perfect and pretty quick for deep dish. This place is on the top of my list for pizza and wings. I love coming here and always feel welcome."}
{"text":"First couple times I went to Rays I was impressed....good pepperoni pizza...although the person making the pizza...I later found out was the owner was rude and I almost walked out the very first time ....  I decided since the pizza was decent I would deal with the \"Pizza Nazi\" ...after bringing the whole family in for pizza while they  were in town from Chicago  I was pleased the staff was helpful...until we tasted the pizza with everything on it...it was soggy and just plain GROSS...  Of course I am a Chicagoian...with New York roots and love both styles of pizza.... this pizza was plain unacceptable....however having dealing with the owner in the past we chose to never come back...  That was almost a year ago..and I have never been back...  If a restaurant has good food and a horrible staff or owner....then it simply is not worth going back...  Rays has other locations and there are several good pizza places out there...  Why settle?"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the food and the service tonight. Ordered 2 chicken parm dinners, 1 chicken alfredo, and a slice for the little man.  Chicken was good and flavorful sauce, the alfredo was served in a big bowl, looked like a half pound of pasta drenched in Alfredo sauce. Each dinner came with a small salad and some garlic toast.  I had a beer with my dinner, but they do have soda and wine as well. They have some Cannoli, and tiramisu for desert but I was pretty full.  Family owned and operated by an Albanian family that spoke both languages at times. Always nice to help out a family trying to live the American Dream."}
{"text":"I ordered some food online, recieved an order confirmation via email. When my husband went to pick it up they hadn't received the order. So he placed the order again. Instead of giving us a discount for their mistake, they offered my husband a free drink. He chose the green tea. He took a sip and immediately spit the tea out because it tasted like mold. Im sure the spout for the tea isnt being cleaned properly which is causing the tea to taste bad. The food itself wasnt good. There was too much cheese that the toppings were falling off. There were too many jalapenos. And the crust was burned...it ruined the flavor. This is the first and last time we will order from this place."}
{"text":"Its fast and by the slice but the pizza is mediocre at best. The staff was also less than friendly the last couple of times I went in."}
{"text":"Don't bother telling them they got your order wrong, they will argue with you and they will not do anything to make it right!!!"}
{"text":"If I know one thing it's pizza. I've tried them all from Chicago to NY to Italy and hands down this is the best pie I've EVER had. Just the smell of the pizza when you walk in will make your mouth start to water. There is the right amount of cheese throughout each slice and they don't hold back on the toppings.  In order to make a great pizza pie you have to make it with love and their staff loves what they do. Everyone is so warm and welcoming, it made me feel like I was apart of the Rays family."}
{"text":"The best Rays Pizza in town. Family owned and always happy to see regular and new faces. Better food, prices and service than other Rays pizza in the area. Pizza is fresh, good crust, cheese and texture. Wings are good and never undercooked. And they give you plates for a to go order unlike the other Rays..."}
{"text":"If you ask for extra crispy thin crust (they will make it thinner and cook it a bit longer) it's perfect! This pizza really reminds me of home :)  ** I REALLY wish they delivered though. I'm sure it would boost revenue quite a bit."}
{"text":"Great Pizza.Served hot and not lukewarm like some others.We purchased plain cheese and sausage and pepperoni pizza,s and they were outstanding.My Dad even called and thanked the pizza maker for an outstanding pie.(Dads 77) he,s not easy to please.Keep up the great job we will be in again soon.............................."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find - I can't believe how many times I passed this place by... I have been here three times in two weeks now. The slices are perfect for lunch (one is plenty) - they also have great salad/pizza lunch combos, etc... I will be by for dinner and get my own pie soon."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers I've passed by Ray's on many occasions. Today we were headed for Wildflower Bread but as usual their dining room was packed. My partner was starving and it was too chilly to sit outside so he suggested Ray's. I reluctantly agreed.   He ordered Eggplant Parmesan and I had two slices. The eggplant seemed to take an eternity, but it was a HUGE order with a side of spaghetti. The slices were just okay. A little greasy for my taste and the tomato/spinach included canned spinach, not very pleasing to the palate.  For some this might be just the ticket, but I doubt I will be back. Too many other good choices (Rendendo's: http://www.yelp.com/biz/redendos-pizzeria-ristorante-scottsdale) right near by."}
{"text":"Tried ordering online (a large pizza, half cheese/half pepperoni, and 6 BBQ wings) but I didn't get a confirmation so I called the restaurant to verify. They said they didn't get my order so I placed it over the phone. The pizza was very greasy and limp. I soaked some paper towels. It still tasted alright, but I was not impressed. My dad said the wings were the smallest he had ever seen."}
{"text":"Thin crust, good sauce, fast service, and clean. If you like New York style pizza and you're in the area this isn't a bad option."}
{"text":"I've been told that this is a family owned shop that has been around for years so I was very excited to try this spot for a quick bite to eat. We went on a Saturday afternoon before the dinner rush hit. The woman who took the order was efficient and quick. Two huge slices of pepperoni pizza and a soda cost about $8. I really enjoyed the pizza. It was big, greasy, and the right temperature. The restaurant also had a quiet, peaceful, and laid back feeling which I am always in search of when dining out. I do plan on making this a regular stop when I am on this side of town again."}
{"text":"My hot man and I stopped by this location a few months ago. I believe it is family owned and the staff was extremely friendly. We each ordered a beer, some wings, and 2 hot sandwiches. The food was TASTY! I knew it was going to be good because we were there during lunchtime and most of the customers were regulars. If you want decent food and great service head on down to Ray's! :)"}
{"text":"Family owned.. always willing to go the extra mile for their regular customers .... great food & cold beer...!!"}
{"text":"I love the family atmosphere this place has.  These guys are legit New Yorkers and native Italians and know how to make great food!"}
{"text":"Piss-poor service!! Food used to be really good. But it has home down hill since. I have been a customer for over 20 years and my last visit will be my LAST!!  Ordered an antipasti salad for myself. To share with my two toddlers. And two slices of cheese pizza.  It was hot plate leftover pizza.. I expected that. It's by the slice so you get 2-3 hour old stuff. But there was no excuse for the moldy mildewed lettuce and freezer burnt meat in the antipasti salad. I sent it back and showed the lady at the counter the mold. She got huffy and it took 20 plus minutes for a new salad.. This one had freezer burnt meat and that lettuce was soaking wet like they washed it a lot. By the way tha first salad was prepared in the front by the pizza toppings. The second salad was prepared in the back.. Out of all the years I have eaten there all the salads are prepared out front.  I threw the salad away and left. NO WAY IM GOING GO FEED THIS GARBAGE TO MY CHILDREN.."}
{"text":"I love this Rays location. The wings are great, pizza is great, prices are great. The lasagna is very saucy and hearty. The family that runs this place are awesome. They remember you after you've been like twice.   I love coming here."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza, Italian Sandwiches, Salads, Pasta, and Cannoli!!! I love this place; every time I walk in, I feel like I'm in New York. These guys are true Italians serving up authentic New York style pizza by the slice (and of course the whole pie) & everything that you're craving when you think \"New York Italian Pizzeria\"!  (See the photo of the ovens, counter, their Top Props awards for Best Pizza, etc. to get a taste.)   My usual is the Lunch Special for only $8.50: Salad, Soda & Slice (If I'm bringing it home, I'll get a Whole Pizza or Sausage & Cheese hot sandwich), but today I thought I'd switch it up and try a Veggie slice. (Check out the photo of this slice of pizza!) It is absolutely loaded with sweet red and green peppers, \"meaty\" mushrooms, onions, etc.! I can't believe that a slice of veggie pizza could fill me up so much that I didn't get the Cannoli. I'll post a pic of their Cannoli next time.  If you've read any of my other reviews, you know that I'm a stickler for cleanliness, and I review for Dining Grades, so I inspect everything. This place is so clean, from the kitchen to the dining room to the restrooms! I can definitely see why they proudly display their A rating."}
{"text":"Pretty good place! But the only thing that bothered me was the pepperoni pizza...had a little bit to much cheese on it! I also had 20 wings on the side! Wings was pretty good but didn't have that much hot sauce on it! But thats okay...I'll let it pass. But overall pretty good place I'll say!"}
{"text":"I've been here like six times, and the food is phenomenal, and the service is a-ok!  Just know what you want before coming in.  Practice orating it before you walk in that door.  As you walk in the place, step immediately to your right.  The main thing is to keep the line moving.  Announce your order with a loud clear voice... \"I would like one slice of pepperoni, one slice of pepperoni and sausage, and a third slice of pepperoni and mushroom\"  It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.  At most, you can say... \"Can I get that extra crispy?\".  If he gives you 'that' look, just drop it an move on.  Then you hold out your money and step to the left.  If using a credit card, insert it into the chip reader on the counter.  Take your receipt and find yourself a booth.  They will call out the pizza order when its ready, so listen up, yous!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza for AZ and for the price.  You are definiately in for a treat with the pie at this place. Especially the Sicilian Slices! It's top notch.  Can't believe some of the poor reviews of this place. Must have gone on bad days.  Here is what not to order IMO:  WING. We did not care for them at all.  The pizza is great and we recommend you get slices. Try the Sicilian as well as the Napolitano.  Other than the old man making the pizzas, the rest of the staff never seems to know whats going on. To their defense its usually just kids. Good pizza joint. They could use more TV's and a Beer license."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had so far in Phoenix. As a newcomer I have been on the hunt for great pizza and I think we have finally found our spot! I had the one slice cheese special with 6 wings. The wings were also very good. My husband got a Sicilian with pepperoni and sausage. He loved it. We will be. Ack Rays!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings around!!!! Staff is super friendly which makes eating here very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Another reviewer said it well...this place is weird. It's dated and feels awkward sitting here. When you order by the slice they have cheese pizza in a warmer and you add the toppings. It wasn't bad pizza but it wasn't worth what I paid by any means. It's never busy here so if you want something quick you can get right in. Service was slow and the girl was on her phone the whole time."}
{"text":"Despite the droopy interior, the big slices of pizza are legit. The owner is super nice and incredibly cute so I will definitely be back not just for pizza"}
{"text":"Been my favorite for at least 2 years now. Originally from the Northeast(Philly area) and this pizza reminds me of what I used to find there. Sauce is perfect, not too sweet, not too garlicky, pizza crust is cooked correctly with a slight crunch to the crust when it's right out of the oven.   The wings are delicious too, no rubbery and flabby half-cooked wings here. The sauce is exactly what I want when I want buffalo wings. Nothing fancy, just fantastic food the way I like it."}
{"text":"Had a loaded pizza, deep fried mushrooms and hot wings! Great service and delicious food! This was our first time here and we will be back! Good job guys!!"}
{"text":"I give this no stars! This was the worst expierience ive ever had. Not only was the staff rude, our food was disgusting. The lady upfront TAKING ORDERS didnt even speak english so didnt understand what I was even trying to order. The pizza had no sauce as you CAN SEE.. The pepperoni's were not cooked. It didnt even taste like pizza. More like cardboard. We ordered a philly special and asked for mushrooms on half of it due to an allergy that my husband has to mushrooms. The lady was completely rude and said they couldnt do that. Umm ok?? Still not understanding why.. She said they could do it that time only. We sit down and they come and ask us if we want the tomato sauce on the philly.  It is called a steak SPECIAL people, that is the only one that comes with tomato sauce on it.. Why would you ask that? Its like they dont even know there own recipes! The philly came out with mushrooms on the whole thing and the bread was soggy. The sauce came on the side watery , didnt even taste like tomato sauce. I dont usually write reviews but this one made me get the yelp app! Do not eat there unless you want rude service and gross food."}
{"text":"Pricey for pizza but I guess when it actually tastes like the pizza I am used to eating I am willing to pay a little extra.  Considering the pizza I have had here so far this is the best. Maybe a once a month drive through for a medium pie on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I've never been to New York but I'd imagine this is how it'd taste. Pizza and wings are excellent. My go to place for pizza and wings in Glendale"}
{"text":"Tragedy! Went in later at night after I got off work, trying to find something to eat! Got a couple slices of pizza... Wish I didn't! The pizza was cold and looked like it had been sitting there for hours... Not to mention the old guy that works there was rude!!"}
{"text":"Always a FAVORITE of my fams! Love the salad!!! Can't beat the pizza that is always served with a hard working smile"}
{"text":"Some of the fellas (and one lady) from work tapped me on the shoulder and said that they were headed here for lunch.  I drove over there to meet them and to try out some pizza.  They have a great deal M-F for lunch.... 2 slices cheese and a drink for only $4.10!   Can't beat that!  The pizza was good...crisped up in the oven nice.  The cheese looked a tad greasy but it was not...no puddles to be found anywhere.  The sauce was just alright but the crust made up for it.  Really good crust! The slices were really big too!  Score!   Service was to the point, not friendly, not rude but you could tell that they were appreciative for your business.  It's only a mile or so from work so I'm sure I will be back for that killer lunch special.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food too!"}
{"text":"So, I had some training at work, and this place was right across the street.  Recently opened, and they had a lunch special on the window for 2 slices and a drink for around $5.00.  Decided to check them out.    Went with 2 slices of cheese and a drink (Pepsi products).  Slices were decent.  A little bit small compared to other \"Ray's\" nearby, but still a decent size.  Sauce was a little bit bland, but the one good thing about this pizza was the crust.  It was better than the other \"Ray's\" around town, so at least they got that going for them.  Cheese was good and not too greasy.  Service was friendly enough, and it was a quick, inexpensive lunch.  Not sure I'm coming back to this one specifically just because the size of the slices, but if you only have $6.00 and are nearby, it would be an ok option for lunch."}
{"text":"Just had one damn good cheesesteak from right here  at RAYS the very best in the North West Valley Valley. yep I tried them all ....."}
{"text":"Order this pizza , Ive eaten pizza from Alaska Wa Az  Ca Nv IL Nh Ny and this f********* pizza was amazing !!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on NY style pizza, and this place reminds me of home!!! Staff is very friendly as well as knowledgeable about their products. Decor is a little... Mismatch? But the food is always delicious and the environment is friendly, so it doesn't take away from the overall experience."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over 10 yrs and sorry to say will not be going back. Restaurant is clean, sometimes with friendly service, sometimes with poor attitudes and bad service.  I have been dealing with that for 10 yrs and am ok with it. What I can't deal with is the thick crunchy crust I have been getting lately. I keep giving them another chance but the crust has only gotten crunchier and thicker. There is NOTHING NY about this pizza any more. Many of these reviews praise their thin crust?  I cannot agree with that in any way, shape or form. Their menu is not bad and I have no complaints there but am terribly disappointed in how their pizza has progressively gotten c over the last year or two, to the point I will not go back after 10 yrs.  This is sad."}
{"text":"Coming from NY to have a nice pizza joint close to your house is great.  Good pizza with real NY attitude, sort of breaks up all the politeness."}
{"text":"The Monster Pie is the best and the cold mugs for the beer cinches the deal!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years. Pizza, wings, appetizers are all cooked well. We typically go simple with a pepperoni pizza and 20 wings, but I have heard the sandwiches are good too. The people are also very friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite pizza places in town! I feel like this is the closest you will get to an authentic NY style pizza! Best cheese pizza!  I wish their ranch dressing was a bit better tho, that's not so authentic and they charge you 50 cents for it...   Overall, totally recommend it! Great family environment!"}
{"text":"Pizza is so personal.  It's almost like discussing religion or politics.  If you are from  back east, you will love Ray's.  And this location is the first one in Arizona and still run by the same family. I've been coming here for over 35 years.  I've tried a lot of others all over Arizona and alway end up back here.  Everything on the menu is great. The Sicilian pie here will kick the butt of any of these new over-rated Chicago pizzas in town."}
{"text":"Service is horrible and the wings are ehh... But Geee Wizzz it's the best Alfredo pizza by the slice I have ever had!! Only order food Togo... The arguing or employees isn't pleasant to hear but hey, the Alfredo pizza is!"}
{"text":"Ray's.. the ubiquitous Ray's.. of NYC Fame.. ha.. definitely playing off a famous name..  Figured we would try it.. Very pleasantly surprised it lived up to it's name..  Stopped in with  my wife Donna for a slice before a movie..  Wow.. great pizza.. Thin Crust,, I couldn't finish 2 slices of \"monster\"  loaded.. my wife is more traditional with the pepperoni,,  fold it in half.. from tip to crust yummy.  Probably 10 different kinds of slices to choose from ready to go.  My wife, the pizza aficionado of our family had us go there two nights in a row.. that is a serious pizza jones.. Even Sicilian Squares.. Lots of other choices too.. just liked the pizza.  I like the layout of the place with the pies under glass countertops.. the tables and tv's, even the semi circular \"bar\" for the quick bite..  You can get take and bake pizza's.. go figure.  really good pizza.  we'll have to the other dishes sometimes.."}
{"text":"Blown away by these guys I literally work next door and always get food there cause it's close. It is by far the best pizza and baked ziti I've ever had always take care of me! I highly highly recommend these guys over any of the other rays ;)"}
{"text":"Kind of hard to rate pizza joints since you can't throw a rock without hitting one, but Ray's is above average.  Haven't had a bad pizza from them yet.  Also, pretty good wings.  The only real negative is they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Pizza is very greasy, which can be a good or a bad thing based on your preferences.  I asked if they delivered and apparently they don't, so I'm not sure how they stay in business.  The building is a bit of a dump.  The pizza was decent New York style pizza though."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is one of my favorites especially for their lasagna. The guys are friendly and know how to make you feel welcome. Their pizza always hits the spot and satisfies my carb cravings. Many times I've only bought pizza and they throw in a free drink which I greatly appreciate. They definitely have earned my business and keep me happy. Thank you for making such amazing pies."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza joint! Love the pies and wings. I visit them at least once every couple weeks for their two slice special. Service is great, also!"}
{"text":"I've given Famous Ray's two chances (another location had raised my hopes), and both times I've walked away nonplussed.   The pizza is especially greasy. The sauce and crust are okay, but the cheese is synthetic and the toppings are either old or low-quality... they just didn't add any flavor.   The cashiers I've had have both done their job of handing me my pizza and ringing me up, but neither looked like they planned on being at the job tomorrow. I didn't dare peek at the chefs.   The store itself was what you'd expect from a take-out pizza dive. Flourescent lighting, poorly cleaned, totally unappetizing."}
{"text":"Love the small town feel! Great food and service"}
{"text":"I love Ray's pizza. That said I can only give it three stars, here's why: the service is spotted, the pizza - while always above average (for an AZ pizza joint) - can be fairly inconsistent, and most of the gripes written up in other reviews are pretty much true. However, I love Ray's in spite of all those short comings. Adjust your expectations and you won't be disappointed. It's a fact that Ray's is a little bit more $$ than the crappy cardboard flavorless pizza slices from most non-NY competitors, the Greek staff can be temperamental, and the three or four topping varieties offered don't always cover *Every* possible way pizza can be topped.  If it's at it's best, it's by far the best slice in the valley."}
{"text":"The best pizza bar none!   Have been going here for years.  The pizza is a great hand tossed thickness and the wings are amazing.  My wife likes light sauce on wings and pizza and Ray's nails it every single time.  Their dinner special of large pizza and wings is also a solid deal."}
{"text":"Rays is near my office and we frequent the restaurant once a month or so for the past several years.    The pizza is really really good most of the time.  I always suggest Rays when employees or co workers want pizza and everyone is satisfied.  Rays is probably about as good as pizza gets in north Scottsdale.  Personally I dont get the slices, I order a pizza, so the negative comments about tired slices int he window may be true, it just doesnt apply to my experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza...but as another reviewer mentioned -- they are a bit feisty. Be forewarned that the slices are humungous, so one might do it if you have a small appetite, like moi."}
{"text":"Something in the water out here in Arizona prevents the production of first rate pizza.  Even the Grimaldi's and NYPD's can't attain the quality of crust that you get on the East Coast.    Oh well...  Ray's does the job of satisfying our pizza cravings. The cheese is a bit salty, and the crust is somewhat floppy.  Wait, sounds like a corner pizza store in small-town USA.  Which is exactly what this is."}
{"text":"Been going here a few years now and never disappointed. Always friendly and they may not know your name but always remembers your face."}
{"text":"Not a fan, not even a little bit. Underwhelmed by the overall taste and the sauce on the slice, which I think is the most significant ingredient was bland. Not likely to give Ray a chance to make a second impression."}
{"text":"I love this place for pizza.  Low cost but tastes great.   If you have never been here, you should go give it a try.  If you have been here before, you should go again.   I have also had the mild and BBQ wings. They are good and go great with the pizza.   Stop reading this review and just go to rays!"}
{"text":"I received delivery of a Sicilian veggie pizza and an order of spicy chicken wings. The pizza crust was very thick and raw on top. Nothing like biting into wet/raw dough. On top, it was just a greasy/cheesy mess. The wings were the worst I have ever eaten - so tough that it was like jerky (you know how you think it's meat and keep chewing it forever and finally have to spit it out because it won't break down)... I was lucky to get 2 small bites of over-cooked meat off each wing. The sauce on the wings was so tangy and sour, it was like licking a combination of lemon juice and vinegar. This meal speaks of a restaurant owner that doesn't care at all about his food. I'll never eat from there again."}
{"text":"Ray's does a pretty good job of reminding me of the slices I would get in NYC.  Prices are right and the place offers plenty of space to sit as well as to go orders.  I have enjoyed their eggplant parm and the house salads are not bad.  The pie crust could use a little less dough and more of a crunch, but I can look the other way with the convenience factor being that it is located right across the street from Thunderbird."}
{"text":"Place is simple, food is good and the service is even better. They are very cool dudes there, I run into them at the grocery store too. We often order the pizza and wings special, my hubs loves the pizza and the wings. I order the chicken Parmesan sandwich. So good and I highly recommend it. We go about 1x a week at least."}
{"text":"Have a couple of slices of  sausage pizza,  was actually pretty good   Would definitely go back when in area   Very nice staff"}
{"text":"What makes Ray's special is that it is nothing special. Just a great neighborhood pizza place serving yummy inexpensive food to a crowd that can't get enough. This is the type of soulful family run restaurant that always makes me happy."}
{"text":"Whoever the manager was on Sunday 30th Dec was awful. I called to let him know that we got a pizza with things on it we did not order. His response was, \"we use a mix so if you order green peppers you get other peppers, and i'll bet you $1000.00 there was no tomato on your pizza, you're just saying that because you didn't like my pizza\". Not acceptable. I will never go there again. We have given them many chances and I'm always disappointed. If I have the opportunity to talk to the owner I will let him know his people need to step it up...My only frustration is that we actually have tipped ungrateful people :("}
{"text":"This family owned pizzeria was awesome. not only was the customer service great and the pizza was delicious as well.  We ordered a half pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The salad was fresh and enough for two. Visiting from out of town with friends. Will definitely visit again when I'm the area."}
{"text":"I'm always doubtful when trying a new pizza place - so many factors - dough, grease, sauce, seasonings, toppings, done-ness.  Ray's was surprising and tasty - not too doughy, cooked through, with a bit of crispiness! We got the meatlovers-type pizza, and the meat had good seasoning, plenty of cheese, not too much grease, and a sauce with a bite.   Also, the wings were good and the fried mozzarella - excellent appetizers. What are the odds the closest pizza joint to you is that good at my three pizza-place staples! Not the best pizza ever, but a nice option"}
{"text":"This location has good pizza and good wings. You definitely can't go wrong here if you're looking for the above and a few domestic pitchers. A decent place with very good service. For my taste, the Happy Valley location does it a little better but I know others the would disagree.   Check it out for yourself and \"You make the call\"."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh slices today.  Always 2-4 pies to choose from and they start coming out of the oven right before 11 am.  They've repainted and redesigned the lighting inside so it has a little more cozy feel (not as bright as before).  Lunch special is hard to beat - 2 slices, soft drink, for only $4.25 *including* tax!  They have some of the best tasting cheese of any pizza place in the west valley.  Crust is always just right as well."}
{"text":"Good slices here, especially at 10:30 when the first round of pies come out of the oven.  Prices not bad either.  Quick.  Tasty.  Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Another great lunch at Ray's - 2 slices with drink for $4.00.  Crust was just right with golden brown edges, nice crisp on the bottom, moist & chewy in the middle, and topped with a tangy tomato and milky mozzarella cheese.  Crust has a lot of residual flour on the bottom, which is perfect for me (and preferable to cornmeal).  Staff are always friendly and the atomosphere has a NY-tribute theme going.  An older crowd was enjoying their slices at lunch today, which is perfectly fine with me."}
{"text":"Looked up their menu via a link on Google maps and when we got there, the menu was completely different.  Wonder if it was just a bad link, or what? The place had a good atmosphere, but they need to fix the link. This rating is only for the irritating link, not the food."}
{"text":"We are picky.about pizza and we love this place.  My husband love's their subs.  All of the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza you will ever find. The food is to die for, the service is more then you could ever ask for, and the atmosphere is inviting and friendly. I drive over an hour to eat at this particular Rays, it surpasses all the rest and is worth the drive. Try it and enjoy! You will not find better! We will never eat at another Rays pizza!"}
{"text":"Rays has been and always will be one of the best pizzas Arizona has to offer. With excellent prices and icy cold beer this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty dang good. Calzone is frickin' ridiculous! The best I've had outside of Metro Pizza in Vegas. It's big enough for two average eaters or one me. Plus, it's only 8 bucks. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"When I got the invite from a friend that we will call 'Little Hulk' to go grab a slice of pizza at his all time favorite spot, I was in. Along with his lovely wife Lindsay (a New Yorker, I might add), our friend Monty, and my hubby Shane, we all headed to a place called 'Ray's Pizza' for our Saturday night grub.  Located in a 'strip mall' (let's face it, everything around here is in a strip mall)  I realized that this is definitely not the local 'Saturday night hang out' since there were only three tables occupied.   I became a little skeptical, I must admit.   When Monty arrived (fashionably late) we all got up from our comfy booth (yes.. it was comfy) and went to order our slice (slices for me) of pizza . After looking at the menu that hangs in the wall, I was surprised to see that they also offered a selection of drinks- wine, pop (soda..depending where you're from) and beer. I ordered a Moretti beer (an Italian lager) that came with a frosty mug glass.. didn't even have to ask for it!  Lindsay ordered a cheese pizza from the different display of slices that they offered, and asked to have fresh tomatoes and jalapenos added to it..my kind of girl.  I had a thick crust (squared shape) cheese slice (middle slice, I might add), and a cheese, garlic and spinach slice.  Both slices were good, but after one bite of my cheese pizza..I was so happy! The cheese was gooey and tasty, the sauce was mild but packed with flavor, and the crust was buttery with a little crunch. We all enjoyed our pizza!  Skeptical? after a few bites, I was a fan."}
{"text":"An attempt at a NY slice. I have eaten here a few times and all in all a three star attempt. Not a bad attempt but still not NY. Why is it so hard to make a good NY pizza here? Everyone uses bottled and/or shipped water anyway. This issue continues to allude me. The staff was great--- 4 stars for that."}
{"text":"Went here just to get pizza for me and my kids and we loved it. The place had a nice and friendly service that definitely made us feel welcome. The pizzeria was very clean which is definitely key. The food was fresh and delicious. We will definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I do not know how the food is as I have yet to taste it. I Google'd Ray's pizza as there is one at 35th Ave and Union Hills. I clicked on that one at 35th and Union Hills, and then clicked on the website. I then looked at the menu, made my order. Then I paid by credit card. I went to the Ray's I thought I was ordering from. I was told that they do not do the on-line ordering and that my order was at 59th and Greenway, 5 miles away. The woman had a sneer at that Ray's as if this happens all the time. She did not even seem to care, what customer service! I then drove to the other one, already upset. When I got there, they did not have my order, I was told this happens with the on-line ordering. The owner was nice at this one, but if there is a problem with the ordering system, why do you keep using it? I then canceled my order and he said no problem, but was wondering why the other Ray's did not call him and he would have canceled it and they could have made the food there. What a FUBAR! I did not get to try the food, and with how this was handled, will probably not ever go back!"}
{"text":"Being an ex NY'er, I can safely say I have eaten the best pizza East of Chicago.   This location has friendly workers and good pizza.   The sauce actually has flavor and they do not skimp on the toppings.   The calzones are stuffed with cheesey goodness! I also really like how clean they keep it.  Tables are cleaned quickly, spills are cleaned up right away.  You can tell they take pride in the business."}
{"text":"Delicious overpriced pizza (when ordered by the slice) I can't offer an opinion on a whole pie until I buy one. Money isn't everything but $9.01 isn't my idea of a lunch special. I'll have to stick to Barros for my lunch pizza fix. No hard feelings Ray."}
