{"text":"What a great little find near old Montreal. Pleasant and friendly staff ( who also speak English) and great ambience. Their breakfast is fresh made and ample. Excellent coffee too! There are awesome sandwiches and other tasty pastries to take along as you tour the old city. I'd highly recommend this place!."}
{"text":"J'aime bien y aller le proprio est très sympathique .Le cafe est bon la facture un peu élevé !Rien n'est parfait ..."}
{"text":"Je suis alle a cette place
pour dejeuner : latte (dans un bol yeah! ) très bon, chocola chaud bon, pain au chocolat riche mais original et succulent. Les gens ont le sourir. Seul petit bemol, la machine de paiement met par defaut un service de 15% alors qu'ils ne servent pas aux tables..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a double shot macchiato whilst sitting in the winter sun that was streaming in the window. Nice slice of chocolate cake. Wish these places would open earlier in the day but notice that later opening hours seem to be more common in Montreal. That is you can't just pop in for a coffee first thing morning."}
{"text":"Delicious. We came here for breakfast three days in a row, and with all the great places around, that's saying a lot!! Love the chocolate hazelnut croissant! Also, their lattes are great! Bottom line: Come here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"A nice place for a quick bite.  

I was lured in by a sign of my favorite coffee on the wall - Illy (which is apparently not used to make a regular coffee). The Mon Plaisir croissant with ham, cheese and lettuce was tasty. The personnel was courteous. I didn't see any sign of a washroom, but my hotel was around the corner, so I didn't specifically ask where it was."}
{"text":"Great service and incredibly fresh food. Nice and cozy place to sit and unwind before continuing to tour Montreal..."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick snack while touring Old Montreal. It was a cute little store and perfect for a quick rest and free WiFi. I enjoyed the decor and I really loved the chairs they were cute and comfortable. It was not crowded and the other people I saw there either had take out or were also unwinding in the shop with their laptops. The staff were friendly and hospitable, spoke in English. Ordered a green salad (which they didn't have already made so they offered to make me a fresh one) and a chai latte, both of which I enjoyed. Was worried they didn't have a washroom bur after searching, they definitely do have a single washroom next to the counter, on the other side of the main seating area."}
{"text":"Perfect if you're looking for a light, quick, and delicious breakfast. Their omelettes are wonderful and the guy who runs the place is super friendly."}
{"text":"Inexpensive quaint place to have a simple but satisfying breakfast. Had bagel with egg special which was very good. Daughter had salmon bagel, also nice. Coffee was good. Service was slow but friendly."}
{"text":"MI sono trovato bene. Ho fatto aprire in anticipo i gestori, che stavano ancora pulendo. Capisco che è sabato, ma alle 8:30 è già tardi per la colazione ;)
Ottimo il croissant appena sfornato con la marmellata fresca di arance. Ho preso anche un bagel con uova e verdura. Ovviamente, ho preso il cappuccino con il caffè Illy!
Sarò stato condizionato dalla mediocre colazione della mattina precedente al mio hotel cinese, ma questa era veramente buona.
Ambiente carino e pulito. No servizio al tavolo. Non fanno crepes e pancakes, ma sono ben fornito di tutto il resto."}
{"text":"Small cafe with some seating.  They have food but it's not cooked there so if you have something like an omelet it will be precooked and warmed in the microwave, same with the soup.  Friendly service.  Nice for what it is but probably best for coffee.  If you want a full breakfast go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The croissant with egg and cheese was excellent, my husband said his bagel with salmon and stuff was also very good. They gave me coffee instead of the tea I ordered, but the coffee was also quite good. Comfortable and relaxed place for a quick breakfast before exploring Montreal."}
{"text":"Solid cafe close to Notre Dame, in the corner is a McDonald's,  skip it and come here instead.  Coffe, croissants and more really good."}
{"text":"Nice people and atmosphere. Good coffee, croissants and OJ. Exactly what we were looking for."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Excellent espresso and the croissants are excellent.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Coffee was underwhelming, and the whole atmosphere of the place left a lot to be desired. I'll walk further next time."}
{"text":"Café Bistro Mon Plaisir is a lovely little spot located just two blocks from the Cathedrale de Notre-Dame in Vieux-Quebec. The café itself is quite nice, comfortable and inviting, with many small tables where you can sit back and enjoy a little something to start your day. 

What brought me her this particular morning was a photo posted by a fellow Yelper of a lox and bagel sandwich, and my quest was well-worth the walk from my hotel. Start with a classic toasted and seeded Montréal-style bagel, add a generous portion of quality smoked salmon on some greens, top the salmon with a sprig of dill and some cucumber, and put that all on a bed of creamy cream cheese. Partner that with a strong cup of coffee and you've got yourself a winner. 

The owner and his staff are quite nice, and the café also offers a variety of choices for lunch for stay-in or take-away. You might easily walk past Café Bistro Mon Plaisir because of the Nestlé and Haagen-Dazs ice cream posters in the window, thinking that it's a tourist trap, but it's not - inside, some tasty pleasures await your arrival."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are pretty good. I had no idea how it would taste and it was an excellent pick to have for lunch! Being that I only speak English it was sort of difficult to communicate with the employees. But they were nice to me. The drink selection is great btw."}
{"text":"My mother and I got the salmon with lox and it was delicious. Their sweets and cappuccinos are good as well. Very cute atmosphere would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit and use the computer - not crowded, great wifi and some sockets

The food is excellent by cafe standards, I've tried two chicken salads and the quiche. The service is friendly. Menu is all in French which may be why there's not more tourist traffic, but the staff speak English."}
{"text":"Pas de grande cuisine ici, mais plutôt de la cuisine rapide avec sandwich et salade, à prix vraiment correct. En revanche et il n'y a pas à dire, les gérants sont vraiment sympathiques. Ils ont l'attitude de petits commerçants de quartier et prennent de vos nouvelles comme si cela faisait déjà dix ans que vous les fréquentiez. Dans les faits, cela donne des propriétaires qui se souviennent de vous à chaque passage et qui vous préparent votre commande avant même que vous n'ayez ouvert la bouche !

Si j'y retourne ? Volontiers pour aller luncher sur le pouce."}
{"text":"Yummy shrimp sandwich on a bagel bun!  This was a nice spot to sit and grab lunch while walking around Old Port.  It's cute and quaint with great lunch specials.  I was delighted to see that they had a shrimp sandwich and immediately settled on that for lunch.  The shrimps were plentiful and didn't have a fishy smell.  The bagel bun was amazing.  It was the everything bagel but light, crispy, and chewy.  I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Old Port!"}
{"text":"Personnel accueillant et la nourriture (et le café) y est excellente. J'y arrête pratiquement chaque jour avant mes cours!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles. We stayed in Quebec City and Montreal for a little over a week, and actively searched for the best croissant. Crazy,  I know. But, hey... why not. 

We stopped here for a quick bite, not thinking it was going to be great. Wow, I was wrong. 

The BEST croissant I've ever had. Period. Chocolate and hazelnut heaven. Their quiche is very,  very good,  as well.  

Coffee is Illy, I believe. Can't go wrong there. Service excellent. 

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I like the cheap price for the area and the breakfast croissant was good and fast, thank you. I feel confy there :)"}
