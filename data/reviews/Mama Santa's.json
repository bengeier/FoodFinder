{"text":"Ordered a large sausage pepperoni for pick up, ready in 25, pretty good, nothing to write to grandma about, but no complaints. 5/5 will be back"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Having tried some of the other Little Italy restaurants, I figured I'd come here for some cheap pizza and italian appetizers. Walked out angry...  Let me start out by saying that it's clear this place's specialty is pizza, and that's really what we wanted. Maybe it's a unspoken rule that you must order to-go and call ahead for the pizza, but that's definitely a well kept secret. So when we sat down to order pizza, she told us that \"it would take too long\" and asked us to order something  Atmosphere: Not wanting to take out (only can afford / make it to Little Italy so often) we wanted to sit down in the dining room. We got lucky, because there's normally a long line down a crowded hallway, but they were able to sit us right down. Unfortunately they then sat down a table with numerous children pretty much right next to us, making enjoying the dinner hard.   Food: Tasted like frozen food heated up. No non-red sauces for pasta. Pasta was watery. Bread was cold (?)  Not so good.  UPDATE ============ I finally got Mama Santa's pizza and I'm definitely feeling the place much more then I was after eating in. Delicious crust, a lot of cheese and pretty good sauce. Large Cheese = $6.   Still, it's clear that this is a cheap option. Toppings are sparse when you add them and the sausage didn't taste great. Just get the cheese and deal with the fact that this place isn't anywhere as nice as the other places in Little Italy. Don't go  for eat in."}
{"text":"The ol' lady and I dined at Mama Santa's a little while back hoping that perhaps it was an approximation to one of our favorite places in Chicago, Marie's Pizza and Liquor.  Having heard this Little Italy establishment is a bit dingy and encrusted with decades of lovely gaudiness, we thought this could be the place.  While the tacky wood paneling when we walked in was promising, the Chuck E. Cheese-like quality of the pizza was way disappointing.  Add to that the horrific lighting in the chilly back room where we were stuck nearby unruly children while the waitstaff did their best attempt at ignoring us, and it's safe to say we won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I am compelled to write this review to attest to the fact that the pizza here is sooooo delish as is the homemade spaghetti.  Carmela's in Euclid and Villa Rosa in Cleveland are also just as amazing.   For me these 3 places have the only pizza worth eating in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"People in Cleveland think that the Little Italy area is lovely and romantic, but having lived there for three years, I think it's kind of overpriced and bigoted. There's definitely a dark side to Little Italy, including but not limited to a racist mob and some super gentrification going on.  Most of the restaurants in Little Italy are overpriced and vermin-infested. One of the cheaper places to get something to eat is Mama Santa's; and it's where we got pizza from while we were in college.  I went with my friend to Mama Santa's for a walk down memory lane, and both of us being visibly queer, we were treated with some condescension (weird looks, snippy remarks) from the waitress. The food was the same ordinary food we enjoyed during college; nothing special.  Note well that they don't serve pineapple on pizzas here... the waitress made it clear to us that we'd need to go up to Hippie Coventry to get something so outlandish as that.  Anyways, pictures are on my blog as always: http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/07/mama-santas-little-italy.html"}
{"text":"A must have for a quick lunch in Little Italy. I recommend the Pizza. A thicker crust, and a home made italian sauce. Simple, delicious. Not much for interior, but none the less a homestyle Italian place."}
{"text":"Two homemade pasta dinners with a bottle of chianti--$36. If that's all you need after a long day of work, come here. It is most definitely NOT the Italian restaurant you think of when your mind wanders to Little Italy in any major city. This is a plain neighborhood spot that happens to occupy prime real estate location. Could they do a whole lot more with what they offer? Sure. It is a bit of a tired version of Italian cuisine (to be kind) but at this price, who cares? My husband enjoyed his spaghetti. My cavatelli was okay if you like that type of pasta. I agree with other reviewers about the need for salting the pasta water. Meatballs are extremely bready, if you get what I mean. I didn't notice salad on the menu, and that would have been nice to accompany a heavy pasta dish. I'm glad we stopped here nonetheless."}
{"text":"Save yourself money and time and possibly an upset stomach. Mama santas does not deliver....quality is below par. Ordered the meat ravioli and my friend ordered the lasagna. Not only did both of our dinners look like something chef boyardee might make, they were salty as a clam shell. And are you serious with the portions? So small. There was one waitress for all the tables and she came around once. Surprisingly the place was decently packed though it was Friday night. The food...was crap. And the maitre d who looked like a dude from jersey shore...what was up with your douchey attitude. Not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Starting with the kind \"Hello\" at the door to the soft fresh baked bread, you know you will enjoy your dinner. We had the linguine with white clam sauce and the lasagna with meat sauce, side of home made sausage. Nothing was left on plate, we used all the bread to enjoy all the gravy.  I will be back when we return to the Cleveland Clinic! !!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I think it's going to be amazing - and every time I'm disappointed. The place has a stellar reputation and awards all over the walls; so they must be doing something right, no?  Honestly, it's probably the cheapest sit-down on Murray Hill, and the food is definitely on par with the price. Cheap, decent, but not award winning."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night with my family and we got two pizzas and two pastas. The marinara sauce on the pasta was pretty good, although watery in some parts and thick in others (still very flavorful). The pasta was cooked perfectly al dante, and the meatballs were delicious. The pizza was overall mediocre. The sauce isn't exactly bursting with flavor and is just OK. The crust seems to always come out crispy around the edges but is kind of thin for a non thin crust pizza. The starter bread they give you is a joke though. Its just room temperature white bread. No garlic butter. No sesame seeds. Not even warm. Service was excellent and the server was very nice."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to eat cheaply. The decor is definitely old school. One thing they may want to consider changing is the access to the bathroom. There is a booth right there and literally about a foot between it and the wall which one must slide through to get to the bathrooms....lmao....I am VERY skinny and just made it.  The pizza was quite good as well as the service. We were there on what seemed like a slow night. I would go back if in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"I love Mama Santa's. Their food is very good. My Grandmother took me here on my trip to Cleveland, and I can definitely say the experience was great. The staff was pleasant, and the decor was very unique. I am very picky about my food, and with that said, I still enjoyed my meal. They were very willing to cater to my likes and dislikes regarding my order, providing me with a good meal, a full belly, and a fun time in Little Italy."}
{"text":"I used to think that Mama Santas was the best pizza in Cleveland.  Ive eaten there for 25 years.  Tonight I convinced my kids to head down to little Italy check it out.  We were totally disappointed.  The food was awful.   Undercooked pizza and salty sauce. A meatball sub served on a cold roll with unmelted cheese.  We waited for a long time for our food even though there were very few people there.  Won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered salad, homemade cavatelli with meatballs, homemade ravioli (1/2 cheese, 1/2 meat), large pizza, side french fries.  The food was just as good as I remember as a kid, if not better.  The service was excellent and attentive.  From now on, this is our go to family restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, that's all we've had here but it's always really good, the best we've found in Little Italy. Very friendly, the atmosphere is super family friendly it feels like a real pizzeria."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here but unfortunately the pizza was left in the oven too long and edges were burnt !  They served it anyway like that!!"}
{"text":"The worst meal I ever have, the worst lemon I ever have, omg. Come on, can you do even worse??? Look at the lemon, did you just chew on it???"}
{"text":"My first time and I was very disappointed. Ordered the pizza (canned mushrooms were disgusting) and overall not good. I can't believe it! Also made the mistake of ordering a pasta dish but not asking for real pasta. So got stuck with poorly cooked boxed pasta. Server got every part of my order wrong but I let the drinks, salad and pizza order errors go because I was sure the food would be great. It was just gross. Don't fall for the \"authentic Italian\" scam. They are using cheap canned and frozen ingredients.   When I was asked how my food was, I made the mistake of answering honestly. Yikes! Go somewhere else along the street!!"}
{"text":"The best ravioli I've ever had in my life!!!! The antipasti is the best and let's not forget the sauce!! I grew up in South Philly and this is better!!"}
{"text":"I've only had entrees other than pizza a handful of times, and I've been going to Mama Santa's for years.  But the pizza is good.  I certainly wouldn't call it the best pizza in Cleveland, but it's enjoyable, especially if you're down for a Little Italy experience.  The overall consistency of the pizza throws me a little bit, though the taste is fine.  Compared to the prices of some of the other Little Italy restaurants -- and just restaurants in general -- it's a good pick for a quick bite, a casual gathering, or take-out."}
{"text":"this is only an OK pizza, not excellent pizza by any stretch of imagination. Possibly, it was excellent pizza in the past and this helped to build up the reputation. I dare to say: Mama Santa does not deserve the reputation anymore.   There was a huge, 30 minutes wait. The place was packed. Another 30 minutes wait for the pizza. We received not the pizza we ordered. Another 30 minutes wait. Our pizza was very mediocre, not properly baked, little flavor. We had a greek salad which was basically a lettuce with 3 olives. We also had a lasagna - it was good, we shared it and 30 minutes later we were fighting who can go to the bathroom first.  Very average place, there is NO way i would go back there."}
{"text":"C'mon man. Maybe this place was good 20 years ago but it sucks now. Tried a variety of the menu items including pizza, side of olives, side of anchovies, pastas and they all were made from cans. Olives -  just plain black olives from a can. Anchovies - cheapest they could find in a can. Mushrooms on pizza etc canned. You get the picture.  Unbelievable that this place still gets credit for what the original operators did in the 80s. I grew up a few miles away and this place is nothing like it was then. Go to the West Side market or Galucci's and get some real olives, cheeses, fish and meats and stop serving grocery store canned goods.  Just incredible what some reviewers think is acceptable Italian fare."}
{"text":"I suppose there is a certain charm to eating an Italian meal in your Aunt's wood paneled basement, where you get what you get, but not if you are paying for the meal.  I took 3 of my kids there on a Saturday night, and it turned out to quite memorable.  First, after 2 requests for lemons for our drinks were ignored, we ordered fried zucchini to share.  When the zucchini arrived, I commented that they looked like mozzarella sticks, and that I had never seen such thick zucchini.  Sure enough- they were mozzarella sticks.  Luckily, the kids enjoyed them, but we were already marveling about our server's indifference.  Finally, our meals arrived.  A large pizza was enjoyed by 2 of my kids.  My youngest son had the veal scallopini, which he enjoyed.  I ordered rigatoni with meatballs.  When it was presented, I realized that it was not rigatoni, but penne.  The pasta was al dente, so kudos for not killing the pasta.  The sauce was just OK, and the meatballs had no body and were bland and mushy.    I didn't expect fine dining, nor did our bill reflect fine dining.  The staff all seemed pleasant enough, though, and aside from the multiple mistakes made by our server, service was not bad.  You get what you pay for.  You gotta hand it to them for the lack of attention to detail on our orders, though.  Aunt Emma in her wood paneled lightless basement really didn't care if you wanted cheese sticks or zucchini...you eat what she gave you."}
{"text":"This may actually be my favorite restaurant on the planet! When I visit, this is a mandatory stop. A great family restaurant, with amazing food...period. The homemade cavatelli is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pizza places in cleveland. I would recommend the triple meat pizza or the customer favorite."}
{"text":"Always think of Mama's as an inexpensive place for pizza and italian food in University Circle. Nothing fancy-just simple good food cheap. Try it if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have never been dissapointed by Mama Santa's. The staff is friendly and helpful, and I love their pizza! It is always hot when it comes out and always delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to Case and ate a lot of Mama Santa's pizza over the years when I lived nearby.  So, when my wife was at University Hospital I thought I would stop by for lunch.  I  should also point out that all of my grandparents were born in Italy.  I ordered the veal cutlet sandwich.  Veal cutlet is expected to be thin, pounds out and breaded.  This was wafer thin.  It was served on rather thinly sliced Italian bread. The veal did not even cover the small amount of bread that was served. I  was shocked.  My mother would have embarrassed to serve such a sandwich to a guest.    To add insult to injury, they served it with black olives from a can, the kind you get at the grocery store.  They couldn't even come up with some oil cured olives in Little Italy!  The people were pleasant enough, but if that sandwich is representative of the current menu a fine tradition has been lost."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Mama Santa's I didn't even really like pizza. Well that was eleven years ago, and times have changed, so I finally went back. One thing they do pretty well is the home made pasta noodles. This is something I'm always looking for, and it's so hard to find. The homemade Spaghetti has huge noodles that would normally be called oversized fettucini. The sauce is simple, but it's tasty and hearty, just the way I like it some times. The real stand out dish was the Manicotti. I've only had manicotti that good one other time in my life."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars... I would.  Being a transient Clevelander from NY, I know good pizza when I taste it. After hearing  from numerous locals about Mama Santos, I couldn't help but grab a pie.  Pros: The staff was friendly.  Cons: Crust had no flavor and was stale. If you're going to have a crispy crust, then there has to be flavor. (See Johns of Bleecker Street) The sauce had no hint of garlic or basil or ANTYHING. I expect that from Ragu... not a pizza shop. Toppings were canned and gross.  You're better off getting a pie from Dewey's by Cedar Lee."}
{"text":"I've noticed that for every 4 or 5-star review, there's a corresponding 1 or 2-star review.  I guess, then, a potential diner should go without expectations, but don't be surprised if it's terrible either.  Here's the deal:  I've been here a few times because 1.) it's cheap and 2.) it's cheap and you get a lot of food (typical cheap pasta joint).  To me, inexpensive is GOOD, so it gets an extra star just for that.  I would say I'm a bit of a pizza connoisseur and critic, especially when it comes to a LIttle Italy neighborhood.  I've had outstanding pizza and average pizza across the U.S. and in Italy.  Verdict: This pizza is mediocre.  It should not be in Little Italy.  I really think that people who say it's good are simply inexperienced when it comes to the joy of quality pizza.  If I want a cheap, inauthentic pizza, I will go to my grocer's freezer, and ultimately be more satisfied by the taste.  The sauce, the cheese, it's just plain bad.  The service, too, has been under par when I've gone.  Get a sandwich instead, but I don't recommend the marinara.  Oh, and that reminds me, the bread they serve is not even good.  I wouldn't be so critical if they weren't in the Little Italy neighborhood where patrons have expectations of quality and authenticity."}
{"text":"Mama Santa's is, hands down, one of the best Italian restaurants that I have ever been to. Normally, there is a wait, but it's completely worth it. I absolutely love their pizza and pasta, it's cooked perfectly and is so amazing. I would definitely recommend Mama Santa's for a fancy or casual dinner."}
{"text":"My family went to Mama Santa's recently for dinner. We had great food, wonderful service, and a fun time. Everything was very authentic and honest in flavor. In reading the other reviews, I think people are judging this restaurant against more trendy / modern restaurants that likely wont be around in 5 years. What they should be doing is judging Mama Santa's against other family owned and managed restaurants that have a long track record of serving consistently good food. Under that level of scrutiny, Mama Santa's is a home run."}
{"text":"This place is family friendly. It also was my go to for authentic little italy pizza pie. It's good friendly service even if the pizzas (that's all I've tasted) is a bit on the brown side."}
{"text":"Where do I get started?  From some reason this place is popular.  The pizza is not very good at all.  There are much better pies on the hill.  Also look around the inside.  I doubt a place that dirty has a clean kitchen. Think about it."}
{"text":"Canned mushrooms. If you love canned mushrooms, then this is your place. Having heard this place dishing out some of the best pizza in Cleveland (seriously, are these people who have never tasted pizza before?), I jumped at the opportunity to try Mama Santa's during a recent trip to Little Italy. Can't complain with service, as we were seated right away, but the pizza ... hmm ...   The crust is a thin-crust, which I prefer, so points there. But, the crust was lacking flavor. Seeing that our pizzas came out with burnt edges, I was expecting a wood fired, smokey flavor. Nope, just a charred, burnt flavor. At one point, the crust was reminiscent of that rectangular slice of pizza we'd get on Fridays during elementary school. And, that's not a good thing. Eek!   The sauce was okay, maybe homemade. But, when I saw those CANNED mushrooms on my pie, I took back any thought that their sauce might be homemade. I also got pepperoncini on my pizza, which was good, but for the wrong reason. They were crazy spicy, which I love, and helped drown out the lackluster crust and ... well, those canned mushrooms.   If you're looking for great pizza on the east side, don't miss Geraci's Restaurant. My photos & review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/geracis-restaurant-cleveland#hrid:55H1O4g1DBteyB6DFD4X4g"}
{"text":"Mama Santa's seems to be getting by based on whatever they did 100 years ago. For me, that's not enough.  The service really is as atrocious as everyone says. Maybe that has a charm to some people, but not me. The décor is dark, drab and ancient. I'll give them that, too. Some people want their pizzerias like a cave. The tablecloths? Yeah, that tacky plastic. Buncha whiny kids? Yep, two feet away from you because everything's packed in so tight you wish you could scream like those kids.  But the food? Surely this is what saves Santa's, right? No. It's bland, it's uninspired. I had a salad that was shredded lettuce. The pizza dough was all right, but not great. The toppings really sunk the pizza; it seemed as if they came from the \"everything a dollar\" rack at some discount grocer.   Basically, pizza requires care to be good. It requires love. I'm sure that Santa and crew loved pizza when they were alive. These days, it's better to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parm.  The sauce seemed very thin, almost watered down, and it was very bland.   The antipasto was mostly lettuce, with one tomato slice and some very thin slivers of salami and cheese, although it was described as \"Italian meats and cheeses\""}
{"text":"Since I live across the street from Mama Santa's, it has always been the cheap, convenient, but bland go-to when I am studying for finals and haven't left the house for groceries in two weeks. Unfortunately, I can't say I get from there because I am craving, but for sustenance only. The first time I picked up a pizza from there, ordered a small pepperoni and mushroom pizza. I was shocked to find that the mushrooms were slimy, chewy, and had the taste of botulism from being from a can. I don't even think Little Caesars pizza even uses canned mushrooms. Not only are the toppings abysmal, the dough itself is nothing to rave about. Unless you're drunk or stoned out of your mind, I wouldn't even pay the cheap price for their pizza."}
{"text":"I'm honestly surprised by some of these reviews. My hunch is that the one and two star reviews are from college kids who are used to suburban chain restaurants. If you go here with expectations in line with Lolita or Greenhouse, you'll be disappointed.  Is this the best pizza you'll ever have? No.  Is the service amazing? No.  Is there some quintessentially Cleveland about this place? Yes.  I've never had bad service, and the food is good. The decor is circa 20th century. If you can figure out the decade, please let me know.  For the love of God people, it's a solid, hole-in-the wall pizza place in one of the best Little Italy's in America."}
{"text":"The only people I saw dining in this place apparently were on a budget with screaming kids. It's cheap, yeah, and the food tasted accordingly.  Who ever thought the highlight of the meal would have been a screaming child?"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Cleveland.  In fact, it's the only pizza in Cleveland I've really liked.  It's thin crust, inexpensive, and delicious.  If you like NY style pizza, this is your best bet in Cleveland.  yes, the toppings are limited, and everything else on the menu is pretty unimpressive... so I don't recommend going for anything besides pizza, but if it's a pizza night this is your place.  There's no delivery (but nobody really delivers around here), but you can get take-out if you call about 20 minutes ahead."}
{"text":"I have never completely understood why people go crazy for Mama Santa's.  It's cheap yes, which might be why there were only eight olives on my pizza.  And yes, they were even the garden variety from a big tin can.  The crust, depending on the day, can be cardboard like ....    I have had some good times here with a cheap carafe of wine and/or the mock sangria and then pizza then was a-ok, but hey, I was drunk.  And with good friends.  The pizza did not the good time make!"}
{"text":"I guess I like this place cause I went here throughout high school and then when I was at Case.  The pizza is solidly good and they have pasta and other choices.  It is a local institution.  A bunch of friend were here late one night and we spontaneously decided to drive to New York for the July 4th weekend, so It will always be memorable."}
{"text":"Great pizza, authentic atmosphere in little Italy.  Very affordable!"}
{"text":"I used to live in CLE, and always remember the pizza from here being excellent. Here on the holidays and brought someone with me, and were highly disappointed. The pizza tasted like little ceasars if they were to actually serve hot pizza. Sat right next to the kitchen, and it was in shambles, incredibly dirty with towels all over the floor..... Big let down"}
{"text":"We had high hopes based upon others reviews, however.......We traveled into Little Italy to have  some geniune Italian food and get a pastry for desert.  We decided to give Mama Santa's a try based upon reviews and word of mouth.  NEVER AGAIN.  the lasagna had dry and crumbly ricotta which had a mealy feel in your mouth.  My sons manicotti was the same way.  The prices were high considering that there were no sides (like a salad) that accompanied the meal.  We paid but will never go there again.  Frozen lasagna from the local Big Box would have been superior to what we were served."}
{"text":"A staple of Little Italy....simple casual Italian eatery......tonite for dinner I Had Veal Parmigiana and my Lady had Eggplant, which she rated as the second best only to the New York Spaghetti house on East ninth.  The veal was tender and tasty, my only issue was that portion of pasta was on the small side. Sauce was very good.  Prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Wow...since I've moved to the west side...I gotta say I miss this place.  Weird thing is I originally thought their pizza was only OK and just went there cause it was cheap....that all changed when I found the key topping that I seem to have trouble finding at other pizza joints...the pepperoncini pepper....mmm so goooood.  NOT a banana crappy pepper..these have way more kick and lack that bad pickle taste...anyway..I digress.  GOOD STUFF:  The Pepperoncini and Pepperoni large pizza please, to go.  Cheaper than most other pizza places.  Cool location in Little Italy so you can walk around before and after.  BAD STUFF:  The wait....lines can be outrageously long at times...given that the interior is nothing special I advise to take away rather than eat there.   PRICE:  cheap, even for pizza  OVERALL:  Still my favorite pizza place in Cleveland.  I don't get it as much now that I live on the west side.  If you like spicy pizza toppings definitely check out the pepperoncini at Mama Santa...you won't be disappointed.  (minus one star for the wait)"}
{"text":"After many years, I was back in Cleveland and looking forward to a pizza from Mama Santa's. We arrived late about 10:25, but not to worry Mama's is open until 11, right? After all that's what they said. Well, we barley made it in the door and were told, sorry we're closed. Not quite a customer-friendly, \"the dining room is closed, can we get you something to go?\", Nope just we're closed (even though the sign says we are open for another 35 mins)  The second star is for what I remember the pizza tasting like."}
{"text":"Pizza is yummy.  Pasta is average for being in Little Italy.  Nice little joint to stop in for lunch."}
{"text":"Visiting my son at CWRU. Went here for dinner. Basic Italian menu - pasta, pizza - and basic decor. BUT the food is prepared exceptionally well! I had the manicotti with a side of meatballs, my son had fettuccini with red sauce and meatballs (single dish). The manicotti was magnificent. The sauce is a hearty, spent-all-Sunday-on-the-stove-at-Nonna's-house kind of sauce. And the meatballs may be the best I've ever had! If you're looking for simple Italian food done the right way, come here."}
{"text":"I like this place Pizza is so good the rest of the foods good too the pizza and the service is good too authentic Italian pizza"}
{"text":"Shatangi, sometime I need to tell you my Little Italy New Year's Eve story, when the house we were partying in was stormed and literally trashed by angry local \"utes\" because we dared have people of color at our party in \"their\" neighborhood.  That being said, I did enjoy pizzas here but not much else."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by Mama Santa's, but it has become one of those last minute dinner spots for me. I never find myself craving anything specific from here, but it's definitely not bad at all. It's also really nice to have a plain old Italian restaurant to go to, instead of the fancier ones in Little Italy.   Pizzas are always good here and I've had some delicious ravioli a couple of times!   Sometimes the servers are a bit slow, sassy, and serious (jokes sometimes don't go over well), but at least you get your food and it tastes great! The only thing that really bugs me is the lighting. It gives me a funky feeling like things are dusty, and they might not be, but the tone of the lighting makes it seem that way."}
{"text":"I went here a while ago with a friend who was in from out of town, and I had heard good things about MS.  My brother and his girlfriend always go here, and I figured what the heck.  It was ok.  Service was kind of slow, but they were busy.  I had chicken parm, it was alright.  In all honesty, my brother's girlfriend Heidi makes better chicken parm thatn they do.    Bread was good, I will admit, I do like the decor and ambiance, but I'm a sucker for kitch."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's not the end all of pizza.  That being said, it's the best pizza in Cleveland, and the only thing that even comes close to the east coast.  If you want anything other than pizza, I can't comment on that.  I'm from Philly, and I can honestly say it's worth ordering from here if you're homesick.  Grab a pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni and banana peppers if you want the real experience."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for the pizza which is why I came here.  If I were to take into account the other food we ordered, it would be 3 stars.    I would not come here for anything but the pizza.  I came here on a weekday around 2pm, so the service was great as the restaurant was not packed.  The waitress and the rest of the staff were all very friendly.  We ordered a large pizza, a small antipasto, and veal parmigiana.  First the pizza.  Delicious.  However, contrary to what some reviewers have said, this is NOT NY style pizza.  The crust is much thicker than NY style pizza but still great.  I was a bit disappointed by the antipasto as this is usually a favorite of mine and I am used to the traditional (I've been to Rome half a dozen times) antipasto with chunks of cheese and large slices of various meats.  This was more of a salad with thin julienned slices of meat and triangles of some sort of processed cheese.  It was this processed cheese that also made the veal parmigiana a bit below average.  Rather than \"real\" cheese on there it was clearly a couple slices of processed mozzarella, and the veal was a bit thin for what I was paying.  The spaghetti that came with it was pretty tasty and the sauce had a sweet smoky taste to it that was pleasant.  Overall, if I was in the area I would come here for the pizza but go elsewhere if I was in the mood for other Italian dishes."}
{"text":"Great affordable and good food.  Although I didn't eat the pizza, I tried some more classic pasta with marinara and was delighted with the taste.  I'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Why doesn't this have more stars? Are you kidding me? The smell draws you in from outside. They have the best pizza hands down and the service is always great. If you haven't been here, have you really even been to Cleveland? I love this place."}
{"text":"A classic date spot and not because it is swanky. It has a laid-back atmosphere and the food is great. No fancy plating, no nouvelle cuisine, just good pizzas and pastas for a good price. The food here is simple and delicious, from the ravioli in red sauce to the chicken parmesan. Great for CWRU, CIA, and CIM kids on a college student budget!  The pizzas are the real reason to eat here. They are by far my favorite pizza in Little Italy. Try sprinkling it with a little parmesan and red pepper flakes for more of a kick.   My parents used to go on dates here as CWRU students in the 70s, and I loved the idea that John and I could continue this tradition. Mama Santa's was one of our first dinner dates together, and I will always fondly remember it as a place where our relationship began.  We ate here again recently, after our engagement photos. Our photographer and his wife were great company, regaling us with tales of their honeymoon in Italy while we ate. It was a lovely evening.  If you're in the area, you may be tempted to try a restaurant with a fancier storefront. But I would urge you to give Mama Santa's a try. Your taste buds and your wallet will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"Simply a great pizza and pasta place.  The help isn't super nice, but strangely adds to the charm.  Lasagna is SUPER and as one of my favorite foods, I'm a bit picky.  The cavatelli is my kids fav along with the pizza.  Everything about this place outside of the occasional line to get in is something we enjoy. The new decor is tasteful and understated and upscales the place just a bit.  Great cheap dining!"}
{"text":"The reviews are right the pizza from here was a big disappointment with soggy crust and lack luster cheese. It looks as if this place was good a while ago but now the pizza is very bad and an easy place to skip when in town. if visiting skip this and go to a better place for you limited meals in town."}
{"text":"Over-priced soupy Italianish food. I have no idea what draws people in here aside from the pizza....which I have not tried.   The tables are crammed together in a windowless closet space. The waitress couldn't be bothered to smile. Both the veal and chicken parm were smashed representations of what the SteakUm people would make if they went into the microwaved Italian food market. The sauce was watery and acidic....like they threw some unripened, unpeeled tomatoes in a bowl of water until what was left was a red puddle of sloppy goop.  Did I say over-priced? $50 for 2 reasonably-sized (yet horrible and portioned to save money obviously by the sickening thin \"meat\") pasta dishes, simple salads, and soda? Not my idea of a nice lunch experience.   Don't go."}
{"text":"Warm, cozy and well-lit. The owner said, \"Come on in,\" as if I were a friend of the family. I had a small Pepperoni pizza and an Italian beer-Peroni? I wish I had more meals here to explore their more traditional kitchen menu."}
{"text":"Wanted so much to LOVE this place after it's reputation. Sorry to say- didn't happen. Pizza was so-so. Salad was swimming in dressing. Cavatelli was good but the sauce was bland and watered down. Meatballs were horribly soggy. Waitress was nice but very disappointed in the meal."}
{"text":"Wow. I  had some really bad luck here the last time I visited.. The pizza did not look burnt...it was absolutely burnt...as was our garlic bread-( both times our rather clueless server brought it out). Salad greens were a touch less than fresh. I'm not much of an in-house complainer...but when I asked for food that wasn't so burnt, the server and her manager were really rude.Granted, it's cheap....but definitely not worth what I paid for it. I remember really liking the pizza years ago- don't know if it was a really, really off day or maybe has just gone downhill. Anyhow, won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"This time I went with homemade cavatelli and meatballs.  The cavatelli freaked me out, actually.  It tasted great, don't get me wrong, but it looks like worms on the plate.  Red sauce didn't taste as good as I remember.  The Italian dressing on the salad was too sour this time...kinda weird.  Service is always attentive.  Pizza is the thing to order."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this classic Little Italy pizzeria!! Grab friends, a large pie and a bottle of Chianti!  The pizza truly is excellent- add basil and tomatoes and don't forget the garlic toast!! It's 'old school' and very layed back so come casual and expect the checkered table cloth!!   Go in with low expectations expecting a non-fancy old fashioned pizza and you'll be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Family dinner, Sunday night, Italian food. It's not fancy, it's the kind of food that brings you back to the homemade meals your Italian grandma would make, if you have one. (Although my Nana would say Papa was the real cook in our family!) The pizza is awesome. Their spaghetti sauce is on the sweeter side. It's simple, homecooked, and served in friendly way every time. We have been over 6 times and never had unfriendly service. Just don't go in expecting fine dining haute cusine type servers, it's not that kind of atmosphere!  You should never critique a restaurant's service based solely on your expectations. A true gem like this has a personality and tradition all their own, and if you walk in knowing that, you will be happy."}
{"text":"Great place for a pizza and a beer with friends. Decent pasta dishes as well."}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza at decent prices. My favorite is the pepperoni pizza. This is not a place I'd recommend dining in - but pretty reliable for take out. Couldn't speak to  items other than the pizza."}
{"text":"Easy to get in for Saturday lunch but I've tried on a Friday night and it was near impossible.  Lunch was easy. The server was personable and authentic with her thick accent.   Antipasto was tasty and enjoyed the pep and sausage pizza.   I'm raised on good Akron Luigis pizza and. Mama's cannot replace Luigis   But if you can't make it to Akron. Mama's is good!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mama Santa's since I was in diapers.  Literally.  This is my favorite pizza in Cleveland by far and always has been.  This isn't a fancy place, but the prices reflect that and it is cheap, cheap cheap.  That said, if you're thinking of getting anything other than the pizza or a salad, don't.  I'm not the biggest fan of their other dishes and there are better places to get pasta or veal/chicken parm on the same street.  There's nothing better though than a pie at Mama Santa's followed by pastries at Presti's or cassata cake at Corbo's.  I've always liked its location in the Little Italy neighborhood.  I spent a lot of time there as a student at Case and as a resident of Cleveland suburbs before that.  I heard that the upstairs of the building used to be a headquarters for the Cleveland mob.  That sexy little tidbit has always drawn me to the place just a little bit more.  The Mayfield Theater across the street has always seemed really cool to me as well, even though it's been closed at least since I was born.  If you're looking for a cheap place to get some awesome pizza in one of Cleveland's coolest neighborhoods, check out Mama Santa's!"}
{"text":"I got a chance to dine in Mama Santa's and the the wait was nearly an hour...if the weather is nice it's worth the wait and the stroll around Little Italy to check out the ethnic village...if not your stuck in the rain or in a crammed hall way. The pizza is high quality with generous portions, I also enjoyed the manicotti and homemade meatballs.  This is a great family spot with an old school dining experience. Try and ask for a booth as the tables are similar to school desks. Great food, 3rd or 4th generation Italian spot for every walk of life."}
{"text":"Best cleveland pizza I've tasted! Wonderful service and always a friendly atmosphere. Homemade noodles are also a definite to try!"}
{"text":"Walking down the street of Cleveland's Little Italy you are bombarded by the smells of pizza and the sights of fresh pastries. So when we were tasked with the decision to choose one of the greasy and meaty smelling places I relied on my boyfriend, and so Mama Santa's was chosen.   We walked in and there was a long line (maybe 14 in front of us), surprisingly we only had to wait 10 or so minutes. I thought this place was small but there seems to be tables tucked in every nook and cranny.   We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, onions, and pepperchinis on top. We also ordered some homemade noodles and meatballs since the Yelp tips were informing us we should do so. I sat, waiting for my food, mentally preparing myself for the carb-overload/coma that was probably going to happen.   The noodles were okay...AHH! before you yell at me keep in mind I am not a big noodle dish fan. But as far as noodles go they tasted very grandma and homemade-ish--which was good!  The pizza on the other hand I can properly vouch for! The crust was amazing! I think there was an extra garlic seasoning on it. It was on the thinner side (more NY style if that is better for you to understand). What made this pizza unique are the toppings, everything was diced up, so the onions and pepperchinis were diced and every mouthful had its fair share of toppings. Yummmm, cue mouth drool.   So if you are in Little Italy, this is a definite safe bet on getting some mom and pop Italian food and service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant will always hold a special place in my heart.  My family would come here often throughout my childhood.  The food is good and the room is casual, but they take service seriously and I'm always happy after my meal.  Is there better Italian food in Little Italy?  Of course.  But it's the food AND the atmosphere that make Mama Santa's worth visiting.  It's like eating in my Italian aunt's kitchen.  Great place to take the family."}
{"text":"Used to like to come here about 30 years ago right after I graduated Case. That they are still in.business the food must be continuing to be good."}
{"text":"Not the same Mama Santa's of old!  Doesn't seem like staff even cares anymore.  A great name was built BUT must be maintained.  Portions are very small for the price.  Too many other good places that aren't riding on their name if old.  Extremely disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The lasagna? Unbelievable. Nothing else like it in Cleveland. There must be twenty thin layers of pasta, cheese, and a delicate meat sauce doused with a generous ladleful of marinara. It doesn't look like much when it's served up - more like a piece of torte than lasagna - but holy cow is it delicious.  The pizza? Meh. Not especially good but not especially bad. I like mine New York style so Mama Santa's doughiness doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"It's a shame to see that Mama Santa's only has a 3 star rating. This place is the cream of the crop in Cleveland. It's a humble, old school Italian joint that gives me a very \"homey\" vibe every time I go. I have been going for about 10 years, at least once a month, and have never had a bad meal or experience. My favorite thing on the menu is the Veal Cutlet w/ spaghetti and meat sauce. You must order the meat sauce!! Best in the city and maybe the best I've had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Coming from New England I am really picky about my pizza since I grew up eating New Haven, New York, and New Jersey pies. I lived in Maryland for 2 years and never found an edible pie. I expected it to be much the same in Cleveland.  Mama Santa's did prove me wrong. It's edible, yes. Is it the best pizza I've ever had? Not even close. It's a good substitute for the real thing, though."}
{"text":"I feel like Mama Santa's is a pretty solid three.  Nothing to write home about, but decent food at a decent price in a setting that couldn't be more stereotypical of a small family-owned Italian restaurant.  Today I went to lunch with 17 co-workers as a send-off to our beloved boss, who is retiring tomorrow.  The service was tremendous considering the size of our group and the bill came with a 20% gratuity added (as I had expected for such a large group).  The server was apologetic about it and she told me that if I was dissatisfied we could amend it, but I felt that they had exceeded my expectations and so I tipped them a little over 25%.  Part of that generosity can be attributed to the amount of money everyone threw in.  The person who collects the money always has to worry about getting stiffed, but I probably set a world's record by collecting 60% more money than the bill (minus gratuity) even though I kept asking \"are you sure you don't need change?\"."}
{"text":"Maybe their pizza quality varies by day. Whenever I've gone over my four years of college, the pizza has been outstanding. It has a unique flavor, and it's not too expensive. They offer take out, which is perfect for the college student."}
{"text":"Their pizza is 5 star amazing - the crust is just the perfect combination of crispy and chewy and flavorful. We ordered half cheese, half sausage and loved every bite. My picky daughter also had an order of fries and they were fresh cut and salted with a good amount. The service is why I give them a 3 overall. At the beginning of the lunch hour we waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged and seated. Then were put at the booth by the bathrooms when the other sections were open and mostly empty. Finally we requested parmesan and red pepper and water refills and never got them. And they still weren't busy. My recommendation is to get takeout instead of dining in."}
{"text":"This is one of the more talked about restaurants in the Little Italy area on Mayfield Rd.  I've been here three times during my undergraduate years in Cleveland, but I was pretty disappointed all three times.  The pizza there is very ordinary and bland.  It is overcooked so the cheese ends up being a little burnt.  I feel harsh in saying this, but I would compare it to microwaveable thin crust pizza.  I've had their homemade pasta with marinara sauce.  It was an interesting concept, but was very bland in taste as well.  There are plenty of better restaurants in the Little Italy area, although those are a little more expensive.  But to me, its worth spending the extra money and going somewhere else.  I don't think I'll be back here."}
{"text":"IMHO...this is the best pizza in Cleveland. It has been a while since I've been able get to Mama Santa's which really I don't have an excuse for because my mom lives in Little Italy. Today was a bit of a cluster...we ordered takeout and my wife hopped out of the car to run in and get the food. Meanwhile I had to keep circling because as anyone who's been on the hill knows there is barely anywhere to park and a constant stream of traffic both on foot and by car. So after about ten minutes and 3 laps she emerged with our pizzas and I swooped back in to extract her. The minute she set foot back in the car that familiar smell tickled my olfactory senses and I couldn't contain my happiness. We hightailed it to my moms to eat. We ordered a large pep, onion, mushroom, green pepper and a small cheese for my son and nephew. The crust was perfectly cooked and had a nice crunch. It's on the thinner side which is right up my alley. It's like a hybrid NY/CLE pizza. They loaded the toppings and used the perfect amount of cheese. The thing that ties it all together is the sauce which is a perfect balance of salt and sweet. These 3 factors are why for me...this is the best pizza in Cleveland....and all for $23. You can't beat it. If you haven't been to Mama Santa's I suggest you get there soon and try it for yourself. I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time  or money  this place sucks it's a joke they call it Italian food"}
{"text":"Mama Santa's is always a spot I try to hit when visiting family in Cleveland.  We went in July, 2014 and had a wonderful lunch.  We both had pasta dishes with salads, tea, soda extra bread, and of course, the pizza.  The pasta dishes were very delicious and the pie did not let us down.  The bill was average and the service was excellent.  Typical lunch time crowd and the atmosphere was good.  They have a small parking lot behind the pizzeria (maybe 6 cars max) and street parking."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the pizza is just meh. Edible but not memorable. I've had better pizza at Costco.   We ordered two large pizzas, one with mushrooms and veggies (we had vegetarians in the group), and the other sausage and veggies. The bell pepper and onions were minced past the point of recognition, and the mushrooms were canned. The only good thing was the crust wasn't soggy.   Mama Santa's wine selection is good. They serve their reds at room temp. Could be better if they actually had temp controlled storage. It gets really hot in there when it's busy and the wines become super warm. Meh.  The place gets real busy too, so while the staff is friendly, they're extremely slow. Because of understaffing, our water glasses were never refilled, and like I said before, the place was extremely HOT.   I wouldn't go back, even if I still lived in Cleveland."}
{"text":"So, Mama Santa's is not as good as I remember.   While the cavatelli and sauce is spot on, their pizza is REALLY mediocre. I'm not sure what everyone else is saying when they say it's the best pizza around."}
{"text":"My grandmother first brought me to Mama Santa's forty years ago. I think we ate here at least twice a month my entire childhood. I bring my family a few times a year....they love the food but they get sick of my reminiscing. Make sure you give Mama Santa's a try next time you are in the mood for Sicilian."}
{"text":"Mama Santas:  What a place!  What a woman!  My date of course...ah what the hell Mama Santa also.  This is a classic place and staple of Cleveland's Little Italy area.  The pizza is hand made and all of the meat topping (pepperoni / sausage) are extremely fresh.  The only drawback is that when it is busy the small dining area can be very loud.  A quick recommendation with respect to dining at this place:  Once you are finished eating, walk a block and a half up the road and have a fresh doughnut at the sweets stand.  Bring back to your dorm room a half a dozen doughnuts for your overweight college roommate and he will leave the room for you and your girl."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the east side. Crunchy, delicious pizza. A staple since I was a kid. Old school, cheap, great Italian food!!"}
{"text":"I moved away from Cleveland, but I often sit in my Los Angeles kitchen and crave Mama Santa's pizza. There is nothing like it here. It is a buttery and crisp crust, with a light tangy sauce.  I have been there hundreds of times and was never wiling to try anything else. I had to save room for the pizza! But this Thanksgiving I went home and straight to Little Italy. Feeling adventurous, I tried something new. I have never had such amazing homemade noodles! Why had I never tried them? I got the thick spaghetti noodles that look like linguini and taste like the ones my Dad makes. The sauce is thin and authentic, and I loved the meatballs... but it was all about the noodle really. Go in. Try those home made noodles. I think they are called CASA, but you have to ask for them or they will give you the store bought ones."}
{"text":"I grew up going here as a kid anytime we visited my grandparents in Cleveland. I hadn't been in a few years. I went Saturday night with two friends. I had the homemade pasta and meatballs. It was very good, my friend had the lasagna and the third person had a veal dish. The lasagna looked different than expected. I tried a bite and it was amazing. I would definitely consider ordering it next time. I love how this place hasn't changed in 20 years. It is all just simple basic and good. No fluff just good old school Italian food. I love that it's still family owned and that they all work there. Prices are good too. Great for families or a casual date night. I will be back soon for sure! Check out this old gem in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"If you like Italian food, go here.  It is the best!    Questo è il posto migliore per mangiare cibo italiano. Giù le mani miglior servizio e cibo migliore."}
{"text":"Finally made it back here, the last weekend in January 2012, and was not disappointed.  My significant otter and I shared a small pizza for lunch.  Theirs is my preferred version of deep dish pizza, with a thick but not too much so crust.  They bring little water glasses for your beer which some part of me just loves.  Their prices are very reasonable and the service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is an emotional review as I grew up on Mama Santa's. Back in high school my wife and I used to have date night here when the pizzas were only $4.25. Even at that time the average pizza was $10-12 elsewhere so this was a bargain. Not to mention it was in Little Italy, one of the best neighborhoods in greater cleveland and a nice romantic place to go for date night. Well they've done a moderate remodel since those early days but it's still the same Mama Santa's. Quaint, classic and friendly with great, cheap pizza. I can't eat the normal pizza these days, but they even have an above average gluten free crust available now.  When we are in town we make sure to take our kids and watch as they roll their eyes about their parent's dating stories. If you're looking for gourmet, romantic Italian food in Little Italy there are far better options. But for casual nights, or nights on a budget, Mama Santa's can't be beat."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza at an amazing price.  My only complaint is that I'm a vegetarian and I only get cheese pizzas from them, I got a pizza from them once and it had a piece of sausage on it, YUCK!  I guess things like that happen so I'm definitely still a big fan."}
{"text":"THE UP-SIDE: If not the best pizza in Cleveland, a close second.  THE DOWN-SIDE: No frills and rushed, impersonal service.  Weird, old people hours.  THE SUM-IT-UP: This place is a must if you are in Little Italy.  Go for the pizza but don't expect any added bonus."}
{"text":"I am a Cleveland local, who has worked on a tv show that was filmed in Mama Santa's. When we were there, the place was nothing but accommodating, friendly, and fantastic. They went above and beyond with accommodations and their food. Without working on something that filmed there I would already have said it's my favorite Italian restaurant in Cleveland. But that just re-confirmed it 100%. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't believe the bad reviews for this place. I''m 56 and have been coming here since high school. We currently live in Massachusetts (where pizza is an absolute joke), but every time we come home to visit, this is the first place we come to. It's a family tradition for us and this past weekend (7-20-15) was no exception. The food, especially the pizza is FABULOUS! The pizza, by far , is the best in the known world. Old world style, it's absolutely perfect. If you like old fashioned Sicilian/Italian restaurants like right outta the movies, this is it. Nothing fancy, inexpensive, but fabulous! If you don't like this pizza, lay down, you're dead."}
{"text":"Almost gave it four stars. The pizza here was traditional and very good. Great crust that tasted like a biscuit almost. I even ate the ends. The chef salad is just lettuce and some shredded carrots and cheese. The complimentary bread wasn't very good. They have cheap domestic bottles of wine and we got pinot grigio and it was good. The ambiance is almost non-existent. There aren't any windows and we sat in the middle of a bunch of people and it was loud. However it was pretty cheap. And the pizza and wine were fine. Soo go here is that's what you are looking for. But I wouldn't get anything other other than pizza."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Northeast Ohio!!! Right in the middle of little Italy and one of the oldest restaurants in Ohio. Great fresh ingredients and homemade sausage. Affordable prices but limited parking. A must stop Resturant if you are in Cleveland :)"}
{"text":"Cavatelli it's self was good, sauce was awful. Brad could have been warm and garlic bread needed garlic on the slices."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza here. The flavor of the sauce is amazing and there is a perfect amount. The cavatelli pasta is also delicious but I am not w huge fan of the meatballs. My only problem is that service can be a bit slow when they are busy so be prepared for a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Allow me to open by saying I love pizza.  Really, really love pizza.  That said, my experiences at Mama Santa's have all been disappointing.  I've visited Mama Santa's a few times over the past couple years (2012-2014) and I've never been blown away by their food.  The pizza is alright, but not nearly what I expected from a pizza place in Little Italy.  I agree with other reviewers who stated the ingredients seem to be canned/not fresh; the pizza is just meh. Not the worst I've had, and definitely far, far from the best.  Their pasta is the same; just alright and made with canned/not fresh ingredients.  Maybe this place had delicious Italian food at some point, but I'm afraid those days are long gone.  I really don't know why Mama Santa's has the reputation of serving the best pizza in Little Italy.  Inside is a disaster. It's dirty, everything has a weird sticky feeling and there are gnats everywhere.    Go to Valentino's instead."}
{"text":"This review is mostly for the pizza, because this is my go to spot for a nice take-out pizza! The crust is exceptional, and is the best I've had in Little Italy. The ingredients are all fresh, the pizzas aren't too greasy, and it's always a great value for the price. Also if you dine in house, definitely try the sangria!"}
{"text":"Here are my notes:  Extra charge for fresh pasta, instead of the stuff from a box. Veal paizziola was light on veal, and rather pricey. Chicken cacciatore lots of oil but good flavor."}
{"text":"Worst service. I didn't even get a straw. I came with my family and they sat us in the middle of the bathroom and the entrance. They only give one refill (which I didn't even get) in the small cups they offer. I asked for fettuccini Alfredo and got fettuccini with butter sauce. The word to describe that was disgusting. Parking was terrible to add to the already bad lunch"}
{"text":"Our family loves eating at Mama Santa's.  The food is delicious. The bread is fresh and the meat sauce tastes like the true 8 hr. simmer type.  We love the cavatelli noodles.  It's not a chain.  We travel from West side to East side just to experience it.  Don't expect something out of a magazine...just come hungry."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but our last visit was terrible. The pizza cheese was so greasy it was soaking through the dough. The large antipasto salad that I ordered for $8.00+ was barely the size of a dinner salad and had hardly any meat or cheese on it. The meatballs weren't bad, so that's why I gave them 2 stars. There are plenty of other places in little Italy to get a great meal."}
{"text":"First time visitor to Cleveland and enjoyed lunch at Mama Santa's.  The bread was very good.  I ordered cavetetti with meatballs and it was very good.  My brother had ravioli and it was tasty.  My sister enjoyed the manicotti.  The wait to check out was long.  The place is old with lots of character!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, pretty bad ambiance.  I wanted to start it out like that, as I don't want to sway people on coming here. The pizza IS good.   My companion and I (on another trip to Nat History Museum, again, the lovely Elizabeth) came here for a quick lunch before heading over. I've heard story upon story about it, so I wanted to finally find out for myself.  I'm sure all you know the history, been there for years, blah blah blah. It looks like it. The dining area has NO WINDOWS...definitely from the days of people wanting to be shut out from their surroundings (which, in great part is the major problem with Cleveland, but that's another story for another board). So, the restaurant is pretty dark.  But, there were quite a few people in there, so it wasn't without merriment.  We had a medium pizza with pepperoni, some of the pepperoni slices so thick that they could be divided up and go across an entire Rascal House large. 8 slices, plenty for two people. The crust is a bit thinner than say Dominos, but thicker than suck-a$$ NY Style pizza. The slices stand on their own, and don't run grease down your wrist.  They have Pepsi, not Coke. But, I forgive them for their misguided choices.  (are there STILL Pepsi-over-Coke people out there? Sheesh. Ever wonder why Jack and Pepsi doesn't exist...??)  Price was very good, just $15 and change for the whole pizza and two sodies.  I'd definitely go back, but not before trying everything else in the 'hood. The no-way-out style of dining room really bugs me.   So, three stars. And another must-eat destination off the list."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend after craving some pizza for a while. I thought this was a great little spot; and a necessity amongst the pricier and more refined restaurants in Littly Italy. I was a little disappointed with the slow service, but some of it was to be expected since the place was packed, and rightly so because the pizza was quite good. I would shy away form the appetizers next time, they were fairly expensive and not quite up to the quality of the pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The crust was very good. Also got the cavatelli and meatballs. You can tell everything is homemade. Sauce seemed a little runny for my taste. Desserts are homemade as well. Those were solid. Cannoli and Tiramisu!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  Best pizza ever, best prices, real italian pizza.  Love the staff.  It's adorable and a great memory every time I eat here!"}
{"text":"mehhh..... I've experienced better.  That's an understatement.  I've been here 3-4 times now (over a period of 5 years), each time hopeful to find something praise-worthy and memorable in this nostalgia restaurant.  In my visits, I have tasted their chicken parm entree, cavatelli with meatballs, and their pizzas. I wouldn't bother with anything but maybe the cavatelli. Each one was as sad as ever. Chicken parm was basically cafeteria chicken parm resting on a sad plate of bland pasta. I felt like I was eating a dish from several decades ago, very old-fashioned. Cavatelli was nice, a little doughy but not bad, and they did the very old school pour-red-sauce-over-and-top-off-with-2-meatballs. Meatball was nice, super-soft, and actually had some flavor!! Nice job. Unfortunately, the same can not be said about anything else..  Ok, moving on to their ever-so-famous pizza, let me break it down for you guys:  Cheese: Bland, bland, bland. And I actually even tried chewing it longer to see if I could salvage any flavor from the charred pizza skin. Futile. tbh- the cheese reminded me of the kind of cheese used in my middle school cafeteria pizzas. Ouch, I know.   Sauce: Very sweet, if you are into that kind of thing. I can see why some people would like this, but not for me, they over-sweeten it, and as a result, you are left with less tomato taste.   Crust: Medium-thin, tastes similar to the bread-sticks you order at chain pizzerias. A little buttery, a little boring. But again, I could see why people like this.  Proportions & overall. If I had one word to describe their pizza: greasy. REALLY greasy, and I'm from NY! They have similar proportion of cheese sauce and crust to NY pizza, meaning a thin crust, little sauce, lots of cheese. But for their sake, they should put less cheese....  **Despite my experience here at this dingy old-world restaurant, I want it to succeed! And I think they can improve greatly with just a few minor tweaks. First- they should salt the pasta-water. If you are going to do a pour over sauce, you better have at least seasoned your pasta. Second- change the dress-code of your wait-staff. Third- get better cheese, use less of it, and don't burn it so much. That way, you will be able to TASTE the cheese AND the pizza won't be so greasy! Pizza grease usually comes from the cheese.**  I don't think I would dislike the old-world feel of the place and their dishes if they tasted better. In fact, I think they could use it to their advantage. But just the overall blandness and greasiness coupled with the dingy lighting and old-school feel just doesnt work. Step up the ingredients, make a few tweaks here and there, and this restaurant could really be a standout in this Little Italy.  Food: C- Atmosphere: C Service: B-"}
{"text":"Amazing food, prices and service! Love the manicotti and homemade ricotta. Yummmmm. I always get the spumoni as well - it's a staple that I won't miss (even if I'm stuffed). :)"}
{"text":"Contrary to some of the reviews here, I do not mind the Mama Santa's pizza - I think it is good, but not great. They tend to overcook the pizza, but some people, me for example, find the crunchiness of it to be appealing. And, they are not stingy with the toppings, which I can't say for many other pizzerias...The decor is sort of old cafeteria style, so I am not a fan of that, hence I order take out instead."}
{"text":"God awful.  Shut down by the health inspector for several months a number of years ago, and it came as no surprise to me. I have literally never understood the praise heaped upon this restaurant. It is routinely the 'best pizza in Cleveland' winner of various sites/magazines.  Yes, they are pretty cheap. So is dog food.  Dirty, crowded, burnt or generally unpleasant food, poor service, its really got the works. Once my water glass was even jagged on the top; luckily I noticed before slicing my face up. Infection is guaranteed at Mama's!  And yet inexplicably it seems everyone else in Cleveland loves it!"}
{"text":"My coworker took me here for lunch to welcome me to the job.  REALLY great pizza.  It was my first time ever getting peperoncini ON the pie!  All my years eating pizza, and it wasn't until Mama Santa that I tried that combo!  It completely removes any need to add hot sauce!  Truly, though, the marker of great pizza is the crust.  Mama Santa's crust is perfect...light and crispy outer, with a softer inner for that perfect crunch-followed by-cushion feel to the tooth.    OM. NOM. NOM."}
{"text":"Good traditional Sicilian food. Great service. Very reasonable prices. 60 years of continuous service by the same families and time tested recipes. I took my mom there from the Cleveland Clinic and she loved it. She worked part time for a family owned Italian restaurant back in NY and she felt it was very authentic."}
{"text":"The decor and service is what you would expect of your average pizza joint- not so great. That being said this is the best pizza I've had Cleve. The house red wine wasn't bad at all either! The Lambrusco with the twist top- it's a drinkable 11 dollar bottle of wine, I liked it a lot.  We ordered sausage and pepperoni pizza. For the first time in my life I knew what great sausage on a pizza tasted like! It was like a lighbulb went off over my head! I tried the spaghetti too, and the sauce was pretty great.  I read a couple of these reviews, and ok ok, the service isn't the best. It's a pizza shop though. When they start charging what Spago charges I'll hold them to an unachievable standard too. We were talking to our waitress though, she was a school teacher and a mom. I like the fact that the owner hire's strong women like that. She reminded me of my own mom, in that she did the best with how clearly understaffed they were, but made sure I had what I needed to eat.   Again- it's a pizza shop, relax! I'll be going back- it was \"divey\", affordable, and solid real food."}
{"text":"Somehow, a lot of people speak pretty highly of this place. Frankly, it's cheap, but that's all it has going for it. I've been a couple times. I've tried the pizza and the pasta dishes. I've tried dining in and taking out. Every time it's just horribly disappointing.  Pizza hut has better pizza, or if you really want an excellent pizza, walk down Murray Hill Rd. to Valentino's. Now they serve some great pizza!  Everything from the decor to the service to the food to the grated cheese at the tables is cheap. I'm not going back, and I recommend you don't either"}
{"text":"Local place in Cleveland's Little Italy - walked down from the CWRU campus where I'm staying for a conference. It was fun to be somewhere different and the service was good. Food wasn't anything special though - nothing awful but just okay. I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"A classic and vintage 50s style Italian restaurant cafe decorated with plaid black and white tablecloths. Known for their inexpensive southern Italian cuisine and pizzas. Pizza is served thin crust. Tiramisu is a must have. Very clean and brightly lit. Service was pretty good. Full bar is well stocked and food is pretty good. Hostess seemed clueless in her lackluster attempt to seat us. Nobody greeted our table for a full seven minutes. When we asked for bread we were actually refused when we were told our meal doesn't come with bread and that they were short. All this while we subsequently watched several tables get a bread basket. So that was a bit tacky. You would think that if you asked for a side of cottage cheese with an ounce of red wine poured over it they would accommodate you. Apparently this is not their motto. The redeeming factors are that it's very inexpensive, they do offer carryout service, and the food is decent.  Park on the street if you can. There are municipal lots but they're  a brisk walk away."}
{"text":"Awful service. Just wish they had some vegetarian and chicken-based options. Ambiance was not too good, but then you get what you pay for. Wish I could have given it less than one star!"}
{"text":"I'm in Southern California dreaming about Mama Santa's pizza. No place I've tried here holds up against Mama Santa's. It's not five star dining it's five star pizza... ya dig?"}
{"text":"Meh. That's really the perfect word to describe Mama Santa's for me.  My main problem isn't with the ambiance or the brisk servers - it's the pizza. I feel like the crust on these pizzas is too thick, too heavy, and always ends up way too oily. The canned mushrooms that they use also kind of gross me out.   I would come here again if I were with someone who really loved it, but considering all the other great places to eat in Little Italy, this wouldn't be my first (or second or third..) choice."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in area. We drive 30 minutes to go here. Have great service and more than just pizza when you feel like a bigger dinner. Terrific!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were dying to try Mama Santa's because several of our friends raved about it. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, but the food was rather bland. We tried 3 different menu items and figured that it'd be great to have some leftovers for work. Although we did have some leftovers, it was not what we imagined. The pizza was not as fantastic as our friends made it seem, and the ravioli dinner was flavorless. However, we did enjoy the fried zucchini we ordered. Unfortunately, we will most likely not return because there are better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some friends, and despite wanting to like it, I just wasn't impressed. I went with some friends and everyone agreed that the pizza tasted undercooked. Those that got the pasta dishes said the flavors were a bit flat. The wine was pretty good (a standard Pinot noir), but nothing spectacular. The service was good and the people were very nice, which makes me feel worse that I couldn't get myself to like the food! I'd skip this place, there are definitely better pizza places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I can't believe two things about fellow Yelpers' reviews of Mama Santa's.  Firstly, the antipasto salad.  Come on.  They have been making this simple yet scrumptious salad forever, and it still rocks.  The secret must be the vinaigrette, which I believe they make.  I've eaten two by myself at one meal (happened to be my birthday, so I was entitled).  It has meats, cheeses, olives, tuna and comes with their great bread.  You wouldn't go to the Louvre and skip the Mona Lisa, would you?  Secondly, 2.5 stars average?  The food here is excellent.  I concede the canned mushrooms, but the sauce, the crust and the meat toppings are killer.  If there is a Cleveland style pizza (and I don't think there is) this would be it.  I have never had a bad meal here - been going my whole life (and my parents started going when college students before I was born).  The soups, pastas - in fact everything I've had here has been good, but the antipasto and pizza are what make it a must stop when I'm back in Cleveland.  This is the epitome of a family (owned, run, friendly) pizza place.  The worst thing I can criticize - parking isn't the easiest.   I've copped to nostalgia influencing my reviews in the past, but this one stands on its own.  If you don't like it, that might say more about you than about Mama Santa's."}
{"text":"Classic. Mama Santa's could serve this food out of an old, rusted out Van and still get 5 stars. It's classic fare done incredibly well, perfected over years and years. It's timeless Italian food.  Pizzas are killer. Cavatelli and a Peroni are my paradise."}
{"text":"Hey! You talkin' to me?  That's the kind of old school, Italian attitude that I think of whenever I visit Mama Santa's. No frills, good food, period.   At Mama Santa's, it is what it is--an ancient pizzeria with sassy, middle-aged waitresses who just want to do their job. I walk in knowing that I might not have the nicest server, but I'm going to mow-down some damn good pizza that's for sure.  I really don't think this place has changed its decor since the day opened, or at least it doesn't appear so. But you know, I kind of dig it. Yea, I know the ambiance isn't much, there aren't any windows and everything inside looks like it's from 1920. So what? All I'm saying is that if I want a fancy, Italian meal, I'll go to a nicer restaurant. There are tons to choose from in Little Italy.   I come to Mama Santa's for a laid back experience and some bomb-diggity, authentic pizza pie. Thinner crust, traditional ingredients, simple, perfect. I have to say, I really like their sauce too! I've actually ordered pasta and was way more than satisfied.   Hey, maybe my palette simpler than others, but my tastes buds know what's good. And they say Mama Santa's is a great spot to sit and enjoy some 'zza. Enough said.    ....now get outta here!"}
{"text":"I think someone else hit it on the head with no-frills and the service is a little low-energy if not downcast. They have some decent homemade meals like spaghetti and canneloni. Not bad if you just want eat something fairly tasty and don't want to spend too much. I would definitely come back in that circumstance, but usually when I'm going out to eat it's because I'm craving something that will knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in years. Not a fancy place, but We didn't come for the ambiance.   Crust was buttery and delicious. Perfect amount of sauce and cheese. Great flavor.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Why, oh why do people rave about Mama Santa's? First, Cleveland has many strengths in the food arena, but pizza is not one of them. So when pizza in CLE isn't good--it really is not good. I think it's a tourist trap for those visiting Little Italy."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here for years and years. Definitely the best pizza in the greater Cleveland area. Casual and reasonably priced, this is a small, intimate place run by friendly folks. 100% would recommend to anyone- I take all of my friends here when they're in town."}
{"text":"never understood why this place has such a reputation. it's just boring, flabby pizza. sort of like my first (and lasting) impression of cleveland - nothing good, nothing bad, just sort of OK. i have no idea why people go bonkers or wait in line for this stuff other than it's cheapness. the pasta is especially boring.  if you do go, it's definitely better to get takeout - otherwise you will end up taking the greasy pizza smell home with you."}
{"text":"Mama Santa's is an okay spot to hang out with friends and share a pizza (particularly on a budget), but as a restaurant, this place cannot stand on its own.  The highlight is the pizza sauce, which has slightly more sweetness than most other pizza sauces, but everything else about the pizza--the crust, the toppings--are ordinary and insipid.  The fried zucchini and cavetlli with meatballs are similarly bland and uninspiring.  This is a case where the hype far exceeds the reality."}
{"text":"The customer service we received from our waitress, Sarah, was atrocious.  And the food was not much better.  Sarah didn't come back to our table once after she brought us our food.  Therefore, we went without refills until after we were given the check.  The food was mediocre, the manicotti noodles were good, but it was clearly jar sauce.     The alfredo noodles were fine, but the sauce was yellow and they charge you two extra dollars for what you think should at least hold up to the standard of  \"Little Italy\".  I don't understand the hype whatsoever, it's a tourist trap.  Don't waste your time/$$$."}
{"text":"an average place. nothing outstandingly bad. not exceedingly the best either. but it's still okay."}
{"text":"Cheesy, greasy goodness. The wood paneling inside is a trip though. i felt like I should be wearing polyester while Uncle Guido cooks in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Their pizza tastes like no other pizza I've ever had, and I crave it! In addition to being a Cleveland institution, it's also super affordable. I live around the corner and I frequently get take out."}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed by the food.  We order pasta, may be we should have had the pizza?  It tasted like it was not seasoned well.  Very bland.  I added everything that was on the table to make it taste like something.  The bread tasted like it came from a bread making machine.   I make better Italian at my house."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here after hearing so many excellent reviews of this restaurant. Huge disappointment. The food had little to no flavor and tasted like a microwave dinner; it definitely wasn't what I was expecting to come out of Little Italy. Unfortunately the service was less than mediocre as well. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"When I moved to Cleveland, everyone recommended me 2 spots in Little Italy- Mama Santa's and Trattoria. Mama Santa's was supposed to be this family owned restaurant that closes for a month every year but they had the best homemade pizza and spaghetti. Because it sounded so unique, I figured it was a restaurant I had to go to.  I was pretty disappointed by this place. As homely as it is, the menu had just your normal type of food: pizza with different toppings, spaghetti and meat sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, etc.. Just nothing unique and different in the menu. Regardless, I ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce asking for their homemade pasta noodles. And, again, I wasn't impressed. The meat sauce is your regular meat sauce and the home made pasta was really thick and undercooked. On top of that, I felt like they only gave me 10 pasta noodles.  I've been back to Mama Santa's since. I've pretty been there about 5 times now. Although I wouldn't say it's the BEST place, their food is very regular and it's the place I go with Trattoria is packed."}
{"text":"Bad pizza. Canned mushrooms, really!  I moved into area and wanted to love it or even like it but it's not possible. Chain conveyor pizza is better. At least poppaJohns has fresh ingredients. Tasteless sauce. Sorry to say. I will likely try the pasta since it supposed to be homemade in house and that's rare these days."}
{"text":"This a Cleveland staple.  A casual place in Little Italy is always full of locals. On typical weekend evening you may see tons of Case students as well.  The pizza is good, the sauce is great and the medium crust has a nice consistency.  The large pizza 10$ before toppings, each topping is a 2$ upcharge.  The pastas are about 10$ as well."}
{"text":"I think they put crack in the pizza seriously it's that good. The ingredients are simple and the pizzas are fairly large. You will probably eat the entire thing no matter what size you get! Overall Mama Santa's is a no-frills family-friendly place and the prices are definitely reasonable. Definitely a good place to go when you want a casual (and cheaper) dinner in Little Italy with friends."}
{"text":"I love the pizza and pasta here.  It can get crowded, but it is worth it.  Nothing overpriced.  Not fancy, just good Italian food.  I stop here after classes alone for pick-up or with my family.  We always enjoy our visit."}
{"text":"I went here on a week night with my best friend and we were really excited to have some pizza. I always have my share the The Feast, but it was my first time actually sitting down in the restaurant. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, I felt like I was at home. The garlic bread was terrible, but I really only came for the pizza, which did not disappoint. Honestly, it's great pizza, and you know I'm all for Danny Boys, but this is pretty close to it :)"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food was good. But our pasta was cold when it came out.  But it tasted great.  Home made pasta was great.  Be sure to set in one of the side rooms in the winter as the front door let's cold air in the main room.  Brrrrrr.  We got pizza too. It was good but came out about 30 minutes before the pasta.  The kitchen needs to get their act together.   Still a great landmark in Little Italy.  I will be back.   Hanna did a great job."}
{"text":"Oh man.    I grew up in the west side suburbs of Cleveland, and since I haven't lived near my home in a dozen years, I've become a longtime defender of my city from all of the people, nationwide, who dump on her.  Also, of I'm of Italian heritage.  Little Italy city sections warm my little red-white-and-green heart.  So I really, REALLY wanted to like Mamma Santa's.  But I just can't do it.  First, let me start with the obvious, and it's not a reason for a low review but maybe it's an indicator of a place that hasn't really got it together.  Mama Santa's (or is it Mamma Santa's, or something else?) doesn't know how to spell its own name!  There are two signs on the outside of the building, with one spelled each way.  A wrought-iron sign on the inside uses the \"two-M\" variety, as does the menu, but all of the awards on display and the newspaper reviews use one \"M.\"    If you think I'm overblowing this, go to their website right now: www.mamasantas.com.  You will notice that the URL uses one \"M.\"  The page title is \"Mama Santas Home\" (no apostrophe). The large logo at the top says \"Mamma Santa's\" (WTF?).  the sign pictured just below that says \"Mama Santa\" (no S, with apostrophe or otherwise). In the bottom left, \"Mama Santas.\" In the bottom right, \"Mama Santa's.\"  If you're counting (and I am), that's FOUR different ways of spelling your business' name ON YOUR OWN WEBSITE!  This is seriously alarming, and I'm kind of amazed that more people haven't noted this.  In an age where branding is king, here's a restaurant that doesn't really care if you're able to spell its own name in Google.   But, I'm willing to be won.  After all, I don't generally judge a restaurant by its spelling, and I kind of like a place that thumbs its nose at convention, as if to say, \"it doesn't matter what you think about us; we're so good that it doesn't matter.\"  I can think of lots of good hole in the wall places that have that charm.  they don't need to advertise, and they don't need to follow the rules because they're just that good.  I respect a place like that.  Mamma Santa's (I shall use that spelling henceforth) wasn't that type of place.  We were greeted by a passing waitress who barely acknowledged us, and we learned just in time that she had intended for us to follow her to a seat.  She tossed the menus on a table and jogged the other way.    In fact, all of the servers were running, which was strange because the dining room didn't seem particularly busy, and the customers didn't seem unsettled.  But surely, everyone was stressed, and the dining area took on that feel.  The bottle of wine we ordered was acceptable, though it was put on our table rather abruptly, with no time to taste it.  Our waters were warm tap water with a couple of ice cubes that put up a struggle for a few minutes before melting.  The pre-meal appetizer was bread; dry, not warmed, dense Italian sliced white bread.  I ordered Manicotti, which is my standard dish at Italian restaurants, my dining companion ordered eggplant parmesan.  We waited for 49 minutes after ordering to get our food.  The waitress stopped her gallop in front of our table long enough to say (to herself but out loud), \"is your food ready? Yeah, it probably is\" before going to fetch it from the warming table.  Still, I had high hopes. I will gladly suffer bad spelling, warm water, dry bread and less than relaxed service for a dynamite meal.  This was not that meal.  My manicotti was firm, as if the whole thing had been frozen rather than cooked fresh.  It was bland and tasteless.  My companion's eggplant parm was fairly good, but the accompanying pasta was overcooked and the marinara was nothing special.  When we paid at the front, the woman said, \"was everything ok?\" And we answered with a pause, and a clearly ambivolent \"well, it was all right.\"  This prompted no follow-up question, just a request for the money that was due.  We paid and egressed the building, probably for the last time.  I was only back in my hometown for the weekend, hoping to experience the best it had to offer.  I do hope that there's another Italian place out there that can offer better."}
{"text":"I admit that I haven't been here since maybe 2+ years ago. When I first moved to Cleveland, I heard this was THE place to get pizza. I lived near Little Italy and man, every time you pass by this place during the weekends it is jam packed and looks like quite the hot spot. You can even order to go through that little peep window! Very busy, crowded place it is.   And for what? Well, I'm not really sure. The pizza is quite...umm..how shall I put this nicely...crappy. Certainly not authentic, and certainly not anywhere near the rankings of the best pizza I've had ever. In fact, I think this is worse than Pizza Hut- I have to agree with another yelper on this one.   Now remember, it's been a couple years, but the only things about this pizza that stick in my mind (and not in a good way) are the canned mushrooms (what the heck is up with putting canned mushrooms on a pizza?!) and the gummy, low-grade cheese. That stuff is thick-gooey icky. Fine, maybe the cheese can stay, but the canned mushrooms are inexcusable. I think they use fresh mushrooms even at the fast food cheap places! What the diggity!   And that, my friends, is why I have not returned to this establishment. I would rather use my pizza stone at home and make my own food."}
{"text":"We are staying at a hospital nearby and just ordered veal parm, chicken parm, and cannolis for carry-out. Freaking amazing!  Every bite was wonderful. The spaghetti option that I ordered with the chicken was so good. I imagine they were made there?  Idk for sure but I loved it!"}
{"text":"Let's keep this brief:  Mama Santa's is coasting on its past reputation.    My fiancee and I stopped in for lunch on Saturday afternoon.  After waiting five minutes to be acknowledged, the host walked us into the next room, handed us menus, and pointed at the table where he wanted us to sit.    We ordered a medium pizza.  The crust was oversalted.  The sauce (where existent) was flavorless, as was the cheese.  The mushrooms were straight out of a can.  The green peppers consisted of tiny little cubes consistent with the frozen variety.  And if there were onions, I sure as hell couldn't taste any.  In quite amazing fashion, Mama Santa's managed to make a pizza that tasted like a German pretzel bread.    Hands-down, this was one of the blandest and worst pizzas either of us have ever eaten.  It's quite obvious that no one on the staff cares.  Take your money elsewhere--I'd be happy to recommend several great pizza places, or a frozen DiGiornio pizza that you heat at home."}
{"text":"Good solid eyetalian food. Didn't have pizza, but handmade fettuccini and house made Italian sausage was very good....and $10. Fugetaboutit...."}
{"text":"This is a very poor restaurant with a good story but very poor quality food. Servers can't focus or give you attention you need. Sauce is not seasoned nor is the chicken. Can't believe that. Salt and pepper can go along way. Pizza is very dry and flavorless. Overall poor food and service."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to say, but Mama Santa's has gone down hill. The food doesn't taste inspired, it tastes like someone who is bored and doesn't care anymore....... I don't know what happened. This is an embarrassment to Italian food. Their sauce tastes like Heinz Ketchup that has been heated up in a pan. Fix yourself, I can't help you find your inspiration."}
{"text":"Are you kidding? You don't go to a landmark of Cleveland for the atmosphere! This is the BEST pizza in Cleveland. I have been coming here since I was a child and the decor hasn't changed much to be honest... But it makes me happy! It reminds me of my childhood.. And a bit of my grandmas basement...  But again, I don't go here because of the interior I go here because the pizza is beyond words! Their cavatelli is outstanding as well!"}
{"text":"Called in a order (pizza & spagetti). I was told it would be ready in about 25 min. When I arrived my pizza was ready but the spagetti wasn't. I waited for an additional 30 min. while my pizza sat on a table. By the time the spegetti was ready, my pizza was cold and obviously, I wasn't too happy. I work in customer service so I know things happen that's out of your control sometimes. I just felt that the kitchen and the person taking the order wasn't on the same page and, my pizza shouldn't have just been left out to get cold while I waited for the spehgetti to get done. Sorry to say, I will never go there again."}
{"text":"My college professor used to sing the praises of Mama Santa's, and an Italian-American from upstate New York should know his pizza. Finally, ten years down the road, I made it here. The service was friendly, and since our order got messed up (our pizza was accidentally sent out for takeaway) they charged us only for a small cheese pizza.   The pasta was fresh, and the house made sausage was definitely better than store bought. When the pizza finally came (pepperoni, mushroom, and onion) the crust was perfectly crispy - hot, lightly oiled, and not too doughy. A particular kind of pizza - not too thick and not too thin - definitely worth a taste if you're in Little Italy at lunch time or want an alternative to the fancier places around."}
{"text":"My Alfredo sauce tasted like it came out of a can. The food was mediocre and nothing special."}
{"text":"PIzza was kind of soggy, and fairly bland. We ordered some toppings on the whole pie, and some on only half.  They made it a some toppings on one half, and some on the other, they charged full price for all toppings (which isn't an issue due to the hassle of having to make a half (also not that much of a hassle) but seriously if you're going to do something, do it right) anchovy app was just a can of anchovies on a plate (I should of asked). Pass on this place.  Random side note, the restaurant origin story on the menu mentions the founder fought in WWII for the Italians and was a POW. It doesn't clarify if he was fighting with the Nazis and captured by the Americans or vice versa, but it would be nice to know."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland. Pizza and fake Sangria are a great combination and incredibly cheap. Get extra sauce on the pizza. The  cheese is supposed to be caramelized. Best sauce on a pizza ever."}
{"text":"First off, let me tell you that for a college student on a budget, this is a great place. I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and it was great! It was a good portion, and the taste was amazing! The waitress was attentive and my glass was never empty. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good, not great food. Sugary sauce. Homemade pastas were not much to write home about, but the pizza was very good. No parking other than street which is very tough in Little Italy."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Mama Santa's pizza.  Truth be told, I was a little disappointed.  The pizza was decently priced and fairly good -- but there's gotta be better ones out there.  Each size of pizza has a set price and you get charged by the topping.  There are no pre-set, recommended combinations or prices.  While some people enjoy this freedom, I'd like to know the restaurant's recommendations and what works best.  We got a large with sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, onion, and pepperoncinis.  It had way too much red sauce and not enough cheese.  The toppings were plentiful and worked out well together, but the crust was a little too thick and flaky.  I'd recommend it for anyone wanting to try out the Little Italy experience -- but I'd like to search out better pizzas in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Great pizza fresh and crispy with enough chewiness. My only complaint with Mama Santas was their were a few discrepancies between their online menu and their restaurant menu. Other than that I enjoyed their pizza."}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience.  Waitress was unfriendly and unhelpful.  Food was late.  Took 30 minutes or better to get my wife's food and another 15 to get mine.  Food was soso and pricey for what you get.  Never again."}
{"text":"Is this some type of a joke? The worst Italian food I've had in my life.  Stale bread, and a  chicken parm served on white bread!!! Unbelievable the service was ok, but the food was horrible.  Tasteless, bland just shitty.  A trained monkey can do a better job cooking."}
{"text":"I've been a couple of times since I am a student in the area. It's generally pretty busy. The food is very home kitchen-esque but I really enjoy it. It's definitely the best value in Little Italy. I love the pizzas (there or for take out) and it's really cheap for what you get. I also highly recommend the lasagna which is made Italian style, not American (sorry no cheese on top). And they have a good selection of wine all very decently priced too.   The only complaint I've ever had was the last time I went with a friend and she ordered a pasta dish and I ordered a pizza. Hers dish came out so far ahead of mine that she was done eating before I even got my meal and all the waitress had to say was sorry they come from different kitchens....  But like I said, that's my only complaint. I would definitely suggest this place for anyone who wants to eat in Little Italy without spending crazy amounts of money!"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor to Mama Santa's since I was a little kid.  The decor hasn't changed, but that is okay with me because the food hasn't either!  Love their tomato sauce and the delicious crispy crust on their pizza.  The homemade pasta dishes are also a good choice and portions are generous.  Mama Santa's is a great place to come for an inexpensive lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Maybe I've been deprived of good pizza living in San Francisco for so long, but this was sooooo good!!!  And SO affordable!!!  This is an old-school pizzeria down to the fake-wood paneling and red checkered table cloths!  No pretensions, no gimmicks, no \"upscale\" over-priced mediocre pizza...the real deal!  Sure, I've had better pizza in my life, but this was darn good!!!  I went here for my birthday, where they were nice enough to give us a reservation for a large party.  The server was really sweet, the food came in a reasonable amount of time, and the sangria was cheap and delicious!!!  I would DEFINITELY go back here next time I'm in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since I was little.  I grew up on the West side, so my only complaint is I wish it was closer.  For a classic Italian pizza, it doesn't get any better.  On top of the amazing food, everything is very cheap (pizza, wine, etc.)."}
{"text":"My entire family loves this place.  We have been here too many times to count but one thing is always consistent, the food quality; it is simple yet delicious.  Do one thing and do it well.  The pizza is the best I have had anywhere in the US and their homemade pasta is fantastic.  The decor reminds me of my grandparent's kitchen dining room or an Italian basement where you would find all of the men drinking homemade wine after dinner.  The staff is quick and attentive and the prices are reasonable.  As with anything worthwhile, be prepared to wait outside on a Friday or Saturday evening.  Mama Santa's is one of the best casual Italian eateries around.  Thumbs up to a great family run business."}
{"text":"Revisit about every 10 years when in town.   Liked it 30 years ago and still do.     Fair is simple and dependable."}
{"text":"WOW was there a huge line when I got to this place. The line was awful, hot and crowded. The waitresses were splendid but I'm marking them down for the food. The pizza is not great, I think even Pizza Hut has better pizza that this. Like a previous post mentioned, they use something that resembles canned mushrooms on their pizzas. I was not expecting that at all and was extremely disappointed. The canned mushroom taste does not go well with pizza.  We also got the pesto w/ noodles that are said to be homemade. They reminded me of gnocchi, wasn't anything special. Some people say this place is popular cause it is cheap,,,,, but I don't think it is THAT cheap. I do wonder how the pizza gets rated the best. They get their bread from Presti's that they serve here which taste good. Bottom line I would not come back. i think I can whip something up my self that would be better [and i can't cook!]"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in Cleveland . And I would put it up against any in the USA . Everything about this place is amazing . Pasta just as good as the pizza . Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a great dining experience . Pay the 7 bucks to valet , & when you're done with dinner walk to down to Presti's for dessert."}
{"text":"a good pizza staple in the cle area. it starts at almost $9 with just plain cheese pizza and then every topping i think is like $2 each which is kinda pricey tbh but its pretty good so im willing to go back. its thin crust, and marinara sauce is not too thick and tastes like actual good qual red sauce. servers are okay not as nice as mia bellas'. food comes at a decent time not as fast as mia bellas' either. you can also order over phone and then pick it up which is nice quick and easy. you pay at the front instead of them picking up your payment from the table which is fine. the pasta i didnt care for. it was meh. the sauce was thick and honestly couldve just made my own red sauce pasta at home."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, unexceptional pizza. Satisfactory enough food but not of a quality befitting the restaurant's reputation."}
{"text":"Ok, ok, ok, I'm biased, I've been going here all my life! My boyfriend says this place is not much more than OK/good, and he has a point, I really only like it because it brings up great family childhood memories. I do enjoy the homemade noodles. The chicken parm is good. The pizza is ok. They do appear to use canned mushrooms which is always a big big pizza turn off for me. I don't mind the atmosphere, but like the kitsch. The decor probably hasn't changed since my first visit."}
{"text":"This legendary Little Italy haunt is a top-5 pizzeria in Northeast Ohio, but you already heard or know that. They do a home-style crust that's a little crispy on the bottom with a zesty, delicious sauce. The old-school Italian decor in the dining area makes you feel like you're eating at Nona's. As a bonus, the prices are surprisingly reasonable. Little Italy needs a parking garage!"}
{"text":"I've lived here for twenty years and even worked at a restaurant in Little Italy, but never tried Mama Santa's. I've always heard such great things!! But, unfortunately, I don't get what all the hype is about. It was kind of a thinner crust and so it got soggy fast. And flavor wasn't mind blowing or anything. Essentially nothin' special, just order Pizza Hut.  p.s. mushrooms are canned, blegggch."}
{"text":"Mamma Santa's is always great. Pizza and home made pasta is awesome.   Love me some mamma Santa's!!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in town. If you want an authentic Italian food experience that's made with the same love you would experience from your mother's kitchen, Mama Santa's is the place to be. Not only is their pizza the best in Cleveland, but their homemade pastas, meatballs, and sauce are the best you'll find in Little Italy.   But first, let's get to the pizza. You know when you travel to other cities and tell people you're from Cleveland, and the first thing they mention is Mama Santa's pizza you've got something special. They make some of the softest dough you'll find, with great sauce, cheese, and toppings. The toughest part about eating a Mama Santa's pizza is not eating the whole thing yourself!  Make sure to try other things on the menu too like the veal scalopinni, homemade cavatelli with meatballs, and even the T-bone steak. I highly recommend anyone in Cleveland to visit this gem. There's a reason they've been around for over 50 years!"}
{"text":"Great food. Generous portions. Laid back atmosphere. The staff is so friendly. You could come to this restaurant anytime of the day or night. Really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"They have decent pizza here, and the antipasto salad is pretty good.  They put tuna in the salad instead of anchovies, which I'm told by Sicilian-Americans, is a no-no, but they'll gladly substitute or add anchovies for free."}
{"text":"Real Italians make sweet sauce!  That's what makes Mama Santa's the best, it's real! If a pasta dish costs more than $10, it's not authentic. Southern Italian food (spaghetti and meatballs) were made for families on a budget.  If you want some type of lobster, bla bla bla, fine.  Pay $25 at some fancy place.  If you want real, down to earth Italian food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Growing up in the 70's as a person of color, Shatangi was taught to avoid Little Italy because it was \"dangerous\". Nothing could keep me from Mama Santa's when I discovered it in the 80's. Incredible pie mad in an ancient oven. Looks almost burnt but tastes the best in C-town that i've had. NY stylee yo  Shatangi told you"}
{"text":"Everything on the simple menu is delicious. The homemade pasta is a must. Charming little old school place."}
{"text":"I was in Clkeveland for a week and a local recommended this restaurant.  The interior is old, we were seated between the fron door and the kitchen.  It must have been delivery day- numerous men carried huge sacks of flour and other supplies past our table.  Our waitress was accomodating but not friendly.  There are framed newspaper articles showing \"best pizza\" awards.  Don't believe it! We sent back the fetticinni alfredo and got a  credit for the noodles but was still chrged for the nasy \"sauce\".  Parking was next to impossible.  I'm returning to Cleveland next year but we'll pick a new restaurant in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Good pizza, TERRIBLE service which, sadly, has gotten to be par for the course in Little Italy."}
{"text":"The last time I ate pizza like this there was a giant mouse singing show tunes, a ball pit, and hundreds of games I could play for tickets to win crappy toys made in China that I would never actually use.  The place was called Chuck E Cheeses and is known for have atrocious vomit inducing pizza.   People that eat at Mama Santas and think its good obviously have never left Cleveland."}
{"text":"My husband and I try pizza everywhere we go. We LOVE pizza. This was the most lackluster pizza. No flavor at all. It was slammed and the server tried her best running from table to table but we'd never return"}
{"text":"Best italian I've ever had outside of Italy. Service is excellent, and the prices are reasonably cheap.   Not exactly fine dining, but is family-friendly and date- appropriate."}
{"text":"Their pizza is a great value and delicious (that has been so for decades).  What they are under rated for is their \"homemade noodle\" pasta dishes.   Little Italy location is pretty, park at Holy Rosary, say a prayer for us all. Then go inside Mama Santa's restaurant which is refreshingly no fuss and humble.   Great restaurant for family meal with kids.  Also great for takeout pizza too.   I love Mama Santa's."}
{"text":"???????? ?????????????????? ?????????????????? ????????????????????? ????????????? ?????????"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by their limited menu options. It seems they have nothing but pasta and pizza, which is standard Italian food, but not the only. My friends and I shared a large pepperoni pizza here, and it wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"As always, this place is exceptional. At $5.75 the Italian sausage sandwich was outstanding not only in terms of value, but in quality as well. It gets a little busy at times and the waitresses can get behind, but the food always delivers."}
{"text":"Poor service. Waitress never checked in on us.  Subpar pizza. Buddy's in Michigan is way better.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is old school Italian all around. Service and food were incredible. My kids split a pizza, and agreed that it was THE best they'd ever had...ever. I had the Cavatelli and meatballs. No words to describe how good it was. Perfection. The meatballs were tender and flavorful, and the Cavatelli was simply amazing. Not to mention a great value....with our beverages our total was around $30 before tip."}
{"text":"If you're a pizza person, this is not the place for you. All hype. I've had better pizza at Valentino's and Geraci's, and you don't have to wait as long at either place. That said, I still think Crostatas has the best pies on the east side."}
{"text":"we've been here a few times during trips to cleveland for takeout pizza. the pizza is very reasonably priced and very delicious if you like thin crust. as far as i'm concerned, this place is a can't miss even for someone just passing through"}
{"text":"We drive 30 minutes to get their pizza. It's not fancy but all the food is great. Love the neighborhood, Little Italy. This is a very casual, friendly place to eat. I like to get the manicotti and a side of sausage or meatballs, that way I have more pizza to take home."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Little Italy. Always picked up, I've never sat inside. Everytime I bring their pizza to parties it is a hit"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we were definitely not disappointed. We arrived right after the Food Network left...so look out for their episode on Cheap Eats. We were immediately greeted with a genuine smile from Nancy and after letting her know it was our first time she made sure to reccomend the fresh homemade pasta and pizza. We decided to try both. Our server Liana was just as amazing and friendly as Nancy. She even found a way to get the kitchen to put fresh garlic on our pizza despite it not being one of the menu options. Yay!!!! It took about 15 minutes for our food to get out and yes, it was every bit delicious as we were told. They have for sure  created guests for life. Thanks guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best places for pizza in the Cleveland area!  Be prepared to wait in a potentially long line for a table. The wait will be pleasurable because everyone in line feels like family, chatting openly with each other. You'll be seated at a small table and greeted by an extremely friendly server. Everyone who works here is friendly!  The menu is small but that doesn't matter. All you need to order is pizza. The crust is soft, and on the thinner side. The sauce is tasty and the toppings are generous. If you're in the area, Mama Santa's must be your go to for an amazing pizza."}
{"text":"I've gotten the pizza here and it is very good. Much better/authentic than pizza from chains like dominos etc. I ordered a chicken and pasta dish the other time I was here and that was very good too. Good serving sizes. Pastas here are great, it's an Italian restaurant, so of course it should be."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Almost a sweet dough. Crunchy, crispy, delicious. Only thing I could bitch about is that they definitely use canned mushrooms --- honestly, it's so good. I don't even care."}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever! It took a while to get a server, but it was worth it. Because my wife and I waited for 10 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order, she brought over an order of homemade meatballs that were amazing! When the pizza arrived it was mind blowing. Their menu was a lot cheaper than most places too which makes it easy on the wallet. My wife and I will be back again and don't forget to stop at Cabo's Bakery across the street for dessert!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST little Italy restaurant that I have tried! Got a large pepperoni pizza that was amazing (a little on the greasy side, but hey that's what makes pizza great). The large pizza was super affordable. I was really impressed with the sausage fettuccini. The noodles were homemade and the sauce was just perfect. I have never had pasta in little Italy this great before.  The service was great as well, everyone was so friendly and helpful. I will most definitely be returning to try more pasta!"}
{"text":"Mama Santa's is not the fanciest or most refined establishment in Little Italy, but it is one of my favorite places to dine.  The pizzas are good...not great, but passable.  I really enjoy the pasta choices.  If I had to describe the quality of food as a color, it would be beige.  Not bad, but not really doing that much for me.  The selling point is that it is relatively inexpensive, which is a deciding factor for college students in the area.  The decor is pretty lackluster as is the service, but I am loathe to criticize because I don't want to get taken out back...  Overall, I will continue to frequent Mama Santa's because I think that it is one of the most \"real\" places in Little Italy.  They don't try to jazz anything up or put on a show.  What you see is what you get, and I respect that."}
{"text":"Mama Santa's is an old school authentic Italian restaurant. My family grew up on Murray Hill so this place holds a certain sentimental value.  Any time I am in Cleveland I make it a point to go to Mama Santa's for some homemade cavatelli. I would suggest the manicotti and cavatelli! Mmmmmm... Oh, get sausage and meatballs too! And ask for some sauce to dip the bread in!! While Mama Santa's makes a decent pizza, their pastas are where it's at. ;)  This is NOT a corporate commercial establishment so if you like the Olive Garden or Pizza Hut, you should know that you will not find that type of food or service here. Mama Santa's uses fresh ingredients and makes most of their food by hand. There are no 'additives', 'preservatives' or other crap in their food. If you're a commercialized idiot, this place is not for you.   I see reviews who slam Mama Santa's for being an old restaurant...well, that's what it you dummies. This restaurant has been family owned for generations, just like Corbo's and Presti's. Yes, the restaurant is historic, it's in Historic Little Italy. Yes they have old Italian tablecloths....duh, it's an authentic traditional Italian restaurant! If you don't like family restaurants, take your ass to Olive Garden and eat prepackaged food made by Cysco Foods where you will pay way too much for nasty food but hey, you can sit in a building which costs 300 times as much to own and maintain.   Mama Santa's isn't just open to make money. They provide family style food in a family atmosphere, something it would appear most people could use a lesson in."}
{"text":"I have heard MANY great things about this place and I finally decided to go there to give it a try. And as I expected, it was only ok. lol.  The restaurant looked very old and I don't really like the table clothes that they use - they are some what dirty and oily. The waitress was ok and accessible. Food was cheap - that's probably one of the only reasons why people liked this place. The pizza was not bad to be honest. and their garlic bread was pretty good.  You do have to go out to the cashier to pay."}
{"text":"People don't go to Mama Santa's for the service or the decor. Come on, let's get real. People go here for the pizza, pizza, and oh ya...the pizza. If your doing anything else but, your doing it wrong."}
{"text":"We went here after getting a recommendation from a bartender at our hotel. We felt it wasn't bad, but the spaghetti didn't have enough sauce, and the eggplant parmagiana had too much. Service was a little slow, we noticed people who came in later getting served before us. But I guess the flavor makes up for the negative."}
{"text":"Good Italian food.  Very popular with the locals.  It was a neat old fashion Italian resturant.  The pizza we had was just ok - nothing either my son our I would rave about - but my wife had the gluten free pizza and she said it was the best GF pizza she's had.  She has a side order of GF pasta the was equally good and I agree.  Our server was great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Awful service...the owner literally carried a dripping toilet plunger through the dining room...the food was edible but not worth going back for."}
{"text":"Great pizza it seems to be a quicker place to eat to go then dine in excellent food but a salad should come with all dinners it is extra. Pizza is the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Recently moved to University Circle close to Little Italy and wanted to try the legendary Mama Santa's. Took awhile for the pizza to be made so I sat talking to the waitresses as they set up for dinner hours. They were friendly with an Italian mama vibe for sure.   Now I just got a simple pepperoni/mushroom pizza --- and I'm not going to totally judge a 56 year old Italian restaurant on that, no way. I mean you want Italian, order manicotti or veal parm etc. right? So the pizza... well, it was good and as others have said, simple. I would say there wasn't really anything special about it, but there was and that oddly enough, was the crust. I don't know what it was precisely, but it was crunchy and slightly sweet. Whatever the indefinable pleasantry was, it was definitely homemade.   I can't say I'd go back just for the pizza, but anyone who's ever visited Little Italy knows there's a certain charm and now that I'm less than 10 minutes away, there's no reason not to go back and order that veal parm!"}
{"text":"Burnt pizza, canned mushrooms, rude, slow service-- but it's cheap.    Really, the pizza is pretty bad.  The mushrooms are canned.  The anchovies are salt packed-- not a sin in and of it self-- but you do have to soak them before cooking with them.  Mama Santa's doesn't.  And yes, they burn the crust every time, yet leave the toppings strangely undercooked.    I will say that the pepperoni are pretty good and the sauce is tasty.  The pasta is generally overcooked.  However, the homemade noodles are a bit better than the dry stuff.  Grated cheese is of the canned sawdust variety.  Additions like mushrooms are the same canned ones they use on their pizza. The sauce is OK-- a bit sweet for my taste, but OK.   And it's cheap.  The place hasn't been redecorated since it opened.  Again, no big deal, but they should probably clean it a little more often.  The service is really, really rude.  I've been in there and watched tables who came in well after us have their orders taken and their food served before we were even acknowledged.  Then after flagging someone down, the waitress acted like I just insulted her mother.    Which I totally didn't.  Although her mother could have taught her some manners.  Oh well.  There are much, much better pizza joints in Cleve-o.  It's just sad that they are not in Little Italy."}
{"text":"After writing our medical student inauguration oaths this morning, a few m1s, my wife, and I decided to eat lunch in little Italy. Dressed up in nice clothes and beginning to sweat in the Cleveland humidity, we decided to look for the closest place that was open. After striking out at the first two places, we found mama Santa's which was open already at roughly 11:30. Some thing I can't say about many other places in little Italy.  We got seated fairly quickly and were given a menu with plenty of goodies.   I ordered their lasagna and my wife had their house special spaghetti and sausage.   Lasagna was good, not too cheesy, and not too noodle-y. Perfect ratio.  From what I had of my wife's, it was tasty with good flavors. The sausage was a bit tough but I liked it. I got to eat 80% of it cuz my wife doesn't like tough meats. It had a nice crust. The noodles looked and tasted like hand cut noodles more frequently found in Chinese restaurants. They were tasty, but not really anything I expected in spaghetti.  The only other thing is that they didn't have huge portions for the prices.  Last few comments. Waitress was nice and they asked if we wanted split checks from the beginning which was awesome. Water came out quickly and was refilled often.  As we were leaving we noticed it getting really full. Must've been a good choice I guess? Or at least a local favorite.  tl;dr: good food, good service, decent portions, nice location/hours, plenty of choices!"}
{"text":"I got the lasagna, the hubby got the chicken parm.  I'll be honest, this isn't going to be like transporting yourself to the old country taste wise.  The food is solid old school prep which can translate to slightly lacking flavor if you have a spicy palate like mine.  But they have pepper (red and black) on the table so I was fine.  Served with a basket of fresh baked white bread, it was a filling italian meal in a no frills dining room but the extra star is for the family feel.  You have an older Italian man greet and seat you and the nicest servers.  Italian accents and goodwill abound and that's worth an extra star in my book and for $23 (which is the price of an entree at the place we walked out of before we came here), I'll take not getting gouged in Little Italy."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for some lasagna one day and decided what better place to get lasagna than Little Italy, right? Wrong. I ordered two servings of lasagna and one medium sausage and pepperoni pizza. The lasagna was mediocre in the sense that I could have had better if I bought a frozen Stoffers one from Giant Eagle. The ricotta cheese to meat ratio was about 70-30. Myself, not being a huge ricotta cheese fan, that's my only real complaint about the lasagna. In fact, the lasagna is the reason why I'm giving the food two stars instead of one. The pizza on the other hand is what earned Mama Santa's such a low review. I opened the box and began on one of the slices in the car and was immediately disgusted. I absolutely hate chain pizza restaurants but that honestly would have been a better choice than the cardboard I had just consumed. I ended up taking it back to work and leaving it for the other officers to eat; however, they were just as appalled as I was. While they attempted to consume the bland excuse for a pizza I began working on the lasagna I described earlier. Ultimately this was a wasted $40 and leaves me wondering if friends and family of the employees are saying \"best pizza in Cleveland.\" This was the first time I've ever thrown away pizza."}
{"text":"Cheap, convenient, fast, lively environment.  And for those reason this place gets 1 star.  Keep in mind this restaurant is near a college campus and you might understand why it averages 3 stars.  Service: nearly nonexistent.   Someone will come take your order and years later, you'll get your food.  Plates will come stacked and you'll have to divvy them out yourselves.  Soda comes with only 1 refill.  Food: this is not \"pizza\" and this certainly is not \"Italian food\".  The pizza dough tasted like it was frozen, prepackaged, mass produced....maybe even from the same factory that makes domino's pizza....(on second thought, domino's dough is better).  The cheese was probably the closest thing to what you'd normally find on a pizza.  The sauce...I don't even remember.  We ordered their spaghetti and meatballs, which consisted of a pile of spaghetti (tasted like grocery box-type dry spaghetti) with a small pile of sauce, topped off with two medium sized meatballs - yup just two meatballs for the entire entree dish (which also tasted overground/store-frozen).  We also got zucchini sticks - such a sad excuse for an appetizer.  The zucchini was probably 3 mm in thickness and again tasted frozen.  I'm pretty much convinced that they buy their products from the same factory that ships out the frozen food you'd find in a grocery store aisle (and no, not Whole Foods).  This might sound harsh, but when there's places like Lombardi's/Grimaldi's in NYC and Lou Malnati's/Giordano's in Chicago (which all get 5 stars), I simply can't give this place anything more than a zero for food if it's going to call their food \"pizza\".  Best part about the whole experience was when the check came.  Oh wow!  Such a cheap meal.  Yes, I certainly got what I paid for!"}
{"text":"Went to get a pizza after work at 10:30 on a Saturday night. They close at 11. Or at least that's when they claim that they close. When I tried to order something, I was informed that they shut everything down and could not cook anything. I don't run a restaurant, but I'm pretty sure being unable to make food a half hour before you close on a Saturday night is pretty damn pathetic."}
{"text":"A Cleveland classic.  Very good meal at a reasonable price.  Have been here many times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars really.  Server was nice and attentive, didn't mention the fact that I had two kids with us, no menu or drinks offered to them.  BAG SALAD...ick.  Pizza pretty good, crust was soft and chewy.  Good sauce.  Prob won't go back.  House wine was not bad, but unless I'm in Italy, I prefer to know what wine I'm drinking."}
{"text":"They burn pizza like nobody' s business! Seriously, i think all the Mama bashing is a bit much. The pasta fagioli is hearty. The drinks are affordable. The atmosphere is cozy and basement-ish(like Polish Village in Detroit-that's not a bad thing). And one of the people burning the pizzas back in the day used to be a dj from the Chamber. I guess that last tidbit was pretty useless. Also, my mom used to wash dishes here when she was fresh off the boat back in the 70's. So at least the dishes were clean three decades ago.  It's cheap,casual and homey. Good enough for me and adds some authenticity to the high falootin' yuppified neighborhood. I'm gonna pop in on Columbus Day and get a burnt pie, yum!"}
{"text":"It's rare that you find a restaurant with a traditional setting and recipes that keeps today's crowd. As a fan of New York-style thin crust the pie was delicious. The seating was a little too cramped for bigger parties which is rough for a restaurant in Little Italy where you can expect large waves of customers. But the pies I've eaten here are delicious and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"1 out of 10: Location: 10 Food: 7 Service: 5 Professionalism: 0  Upon walking in the restaurant I was unwittingly filled in on the current drama in the restaurant due to a waitress loudly explaining to the manager(or owner) how upset she was with a customer. (Understandable, but extremely unprofessional to do in front of everyone at the front door) soon after sitting down, I witnessed the same waitress demand that the manager say something to the customer and then, when he tried to get a waiter to do it, tell the manager that it's his job because he's \"the boss\". Right after that, I overheard one waitress call another a B**** again, loudly in front of customers. Then, a butch of wait staff sat at a table eating food and complaining loudly about other wait staff And customers.  The food was good(could be better), our waitress was ok(handed us our dinnerware and placemats to put out ourselves but she was friendly), just the unprofessionalism was unreal. I am only reviewing for the benefit of the owners that are hopefully unaware of the abysmal behavior of the staff. If it weren't for the location, I would give this place a month. I hope this helps."}
{"text":"Mama Santa's is my go-to for pizza when I'm near Little Italy. It's at a reasonable price, and the pizza is always done the way I like it (golden brown). The rest of the menu is just sub-par in my opinion, but that's okay because I know what I am ordering when I go there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places of all time! I'll admit the prices can be a little steep- initially it doesn't seem like it because the base cost of the pizza is pretty cheap, but every topping you add is pretty expensive- but it is so worth the cost! The authentic Italian vibe adds to the overall experience and I'm a huge fan of the homemade sangria the restaurant serves. Unfortunately, during dinner hours the store can be packed busy and I've even seen a line out the door at some times so finding a good off hour is very helpful."}
{"text":"Got a take out House Favorite and it was delicious as well as reasonably priced. Quick and friendly service. Definitely plan on going here again."}
{"text":"The veal parm was bomb, not a big fan of the pasta they use but it was a very good meal."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time, the food has always been excellent, while I myself am not from little Italy Cleveland Ohio my mom is, and it's always nice to hit up the places my mom and family used to frequent.  Oh and did I mention that the food is excellent. This review is from \"Wild Bill on the hill's\" grandson."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for decades and have rarely had a bad experience. Even though I'm a west sider, I try to cross the river every so-often. Went for a visit this past week and the food was still consistent with previous visits.  Pizza is really great- good sauce, crispy crust. Cavatelli is also wonderful. Homemade and cooked to perfection. This place knows how to do pasta. The sauce is also very good. I'm going to ding them on their meatballs which I think are just ok, nothing spectacular. The bread crumb to meat ratio is too high for me, but other people I've dined with love them.   My only criticism is if you get the pizza to go, the crust doesn't hold up, and sometimes they don't put enough sauce on the pasta, but we just ask for more if that happens. The decor is a bit tacky, and the worst part is that they just did an update (slaps forehead)! But, I'm not eating the decor and it's not a fancy joint so I don't really care if there are fake wood paneled walls."}
{"text":"So much of the dining experience depends on the way that the restaurant staff treats its customers.  Though I would say that the food was decent (not great), what I found most memorable about Mama Santa's was just how unfriendly the staff was.  The man who seated us looked put out that he had to walk us to the back of the restaurant and couldn't offer up a greeting or smile.  Our largely absent server was equally unfriendly.  As for the food, we ordered various chicken dishes and thought they were pretty good, but the side of spaghetti tasted like it came from a can.  Brings back childhood memories of Chef Boyardee!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why people think this place is so wonderful. It's the most overrated pizza in Cleveland. Our pizza came to us burnt, it was even black in places. We were told we should have ordered it \"undercooked\". I didn't know you had to tell someone to cook a pizza properly. On top of that the service tends to be very brusque, indifferent, even borderline rude. Topped with the fact they tried to overcharge my debit card. I know prices are cheap here, but there's much better pizza and service to be found in Little Italy."}
{"text":"The best pizza you will ever have-- I pickup pizza here nearly every week! You can smell the pizza from the minute you set foot in the little Italy area. Traditional diner interior with brick walls, nothing glamorous, just a great place to get pizza! I generally do not order their pasta, it's not nearly as good as the pizza is. Usually very crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings, but completely worth the wait. Thin crust pizza with perfect sauce and a stringy cheese: the true definition of Italian comfort food!!"}
{"text":"First I have to say that the food was good and the service was friendly.  The pizza was not as good as I expected, but that is only because so many people had built it up.  Their meatballs and homemade noodles were amazing.  I only wish we would have gotten take out.    I am only writing this review in case someone at the restaurant sees it and takes note- the place need a deep clean and some TLC!    The floor was so grimy and had food all over it, there were at least 3 fruit flies on the left over bread basket on the table next to us and 2 fruit flies on my wine glass.  I am not a picky person but the place just needs some love.  The prices are amazing and so is the food.  I don't think I can order take out though from this place after seeing how dirty the dining room is, I would hate to see the kitchen!"}
{"text":"This is an old school Italian Restaurant with the prices to match - a real gem!  I was in a party of 5 and we were all hungry for pizza.  We were told by the locals to come to this Little Italy landmark for authentic \"Cleveland\" pizza, so we went across town from Westlake to Mama Santa's.  The owner welcomed us like we were old regulars and we settled into a table.  Barbara, one of the friendliest waitresses I've had, came and took our order for a few beers and a bottle of wine.  A couple of us wanted anti-pasta but she said we could get a large, share it with the whole table, and save some money.  She also helped us with the pizza order and explained about how the pizza dough is made daily along with the tiramisu and cannoli.  The couple at the table next to us had also driven from Westlake and they had been regulars for 30 years.  They said they made the drive a couple times each month.  The pizza did not disappoint and the tiramisu and cannoli was the best I have had since South Philly about 30 years ago.  We all had a great meal at a low price and a good time - we all said that we would be back on our next trips to Cleveland.  The only negative is that they do not take American Express."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the east side. Sicilian style thin crust authentic. You have to try the spaghetti.  It's home made and with a meatball it's perfect with the sauce that is really authentic too. Best service from all especially Deb. I would really miss this place if I couldn't come here anymore. Deb treats me like a king every time I'm here. A little Italy institution."}
{"text":"the pizzas are good here--still not new york style, but good. pretty thin crust, better than most you'd get in california fo sho.  the best part was our server, I believe her name was amy.  Super friendly, and knew the menu.  easily accommodated our 12 person party that came in just before the 11 pm closing of the kitchen.  she was super tired, but was still very friendly and gave us lots of great advice about what to order, including the hand made pastas, and of course the pizza.  I always just get a cheese to test how close to a Ny style they are, but we also ordered a pizza with everything, and they were both good.  good crust texture and taste, good sauce, good cheese ratio.  The pasta, while being fresh, was a little bland though.  I got the homemade spaghetti which was very thick, but the marinara sauce was pretty bland, and the noodles could have been more chewy."}
