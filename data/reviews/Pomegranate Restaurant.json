{"text":"Lovely small place with great decoration/ambience, sadly the food is very mediocre, the prices do make up for it somewhat."}
{"text":"maast-e saadeh vegetarian fesenjaan"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It makes me so happy to see people from all cultures enjoying Iranian food, amazing food, cozy atmosphere, nice classic Iranian music in the background and great service too"}
{"text":"I had zeitoon parvardeh it was well season and was the perfect appetizer to start with  my friend had fasenjaan a great vegetarian dish and  i had aloo ghesi it was pretty filling good mixing of flavors and authentic.  the sitting the arrangement is snug and nice"}
{"text":"The cons : The place seems to be packed all the time which is great.  But the pleasant but harried owner needs to stop telling the customers when to leave the minute they walk in the door.  Find a better reservation system.  It's off-putting to order dinner knowing they are waiting for you to leave from the minute you arrive. That said-- once we got our food no one came to our table again to ask how the meal was or if we wanted more drinks.  I've had better saffron rice and some of the food was a bit bland but....  The Pros: the lamb is absolutely amazing in all the dishes. Cooked to perfection. That and the atmosphere made it all worthwhile. The decor and music is wonderful and transformative."}
{"text":"BEST persian food in Toronto and GTA!  I have had all their food in their menu (not in one sitting lol) and they are all great!  great service, a little bit slow on some nights but generally speaking not that slow. they take reservation! it is always packed!  and they have LLBO  perfect  and the lady that works there is so authetic!!! never seen some one like her! She is a non persian who speaks fluent farsi! amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Pomegranate for the first time with three friends last night and loved it. The service was excellent but not stifling and the food was delicious and affordable.   As the three of us had never been to the restaurant before, we asked the server's advice about what to order. We are all omnivore/carnivores, but one person in our party is lactose intolerant, which we mentioned to the server. We'd picked some appetizers (dolmeh and charred eggplant dip - both delicious and piping hot when they arrived) and the server expertly recommended three dishes as an introduction into Persian cuisine, all of which were complex and filling.  We shared the dessert plate of three pastries, which was a perfect end to the meal. With drinks (they have a decent wine selection, too), appetizers, mains and a shared dessert, the bill came to around $100 for the three of us, which was amazing value for the great meal.  I can see how this place would be challenging for vegetarians, however, as most of the curried and stewed dishes are very meat-focused.   I will definitely go back, probably bringing out-of-town guests to try it out as it's a comfortable atmosphere with great food and reliable, friendly service."}
{"text":"The decor!! Makes me proud to be inside.  The service is nice. It's cool being served by non-Persians who are enthusiastic about the pronunciation and the food items.   Khoresht (stew) is the best in the city. The gheymeh tastes like Ashura gheymeh!!   The appetizer option of mirza ghasemi is the best I have ever had. Has a smokey taste."}
{"text":"Being married to an Iranian, you get familiar very quickly with good vs. mediocre Persian food, and this place never fails to disappoint! Their specials are very interesting and they offer more traditional fare compared to the usual kebab places that pop up frequently around Toronto. Food is very fresh and flavourful, although if you are not a fan of lamb or a vegetarian the menu will be more limited for you, although the eggplant dishes are great. Their lamb shank is out of this world, fall-off-the bone, and I highly recommend the jeweled rice (morasah polow) and mirza ghasemi eggplant. The staff is always lovely and accomodating and very knowledgeable about the food/language. For some extra fun reserve the \"takht\" to sit on at the back and don't forget to finish off the meal with tea!"}
{"text":"Awesome and cool environment and unbelievably tasteful and fresh Persian cuisine, already tried dolmeh,fesenjoon and baghali polo and lamb shank and they all were one the best i have tried in canada"}
{"text":"Their food is good. what I didn't like was their attitude. I tried 2 times to go there for trying their deserts.The first time we went with my colleagues and after the waitress took our order, the owner lady came and told us in a harsh way that they need the spot for people who want to dine. so we had to leave.  the second time, I asked the waiter at door hoping that they might change their attitude. and he said they don't have spot for us and they have only for people who order food."}
{"text":"Group of 6, it was hit and miss between the group.    First, the service was pretty poor, had to give the staff a serious talking to before they got into the game.  Waiting with no water, waitress running around doing nothing between getting drinks, huge wait just to get there. After the talking to, they got down to business.  Those that ordered dishes with lamb enjoyed them, those that didn't like lamb and got the various stews thought they were way too sweet and not very good."}
{"text":"This place offers high quality gourmet persian food in very generous portions. I am Persian myself and am very familiar with Persian food and have tried Persian restaurants around the world, including in Iran itseld, and I must say I was extremely impressed by the quality, presentation and value of the Persian food at this restaurant, as the amazing vegetarian options, which make this restaurant very unique.  After a very satisfying first experience tonight, I tipped generously and promised myself to go back multiple times for the period of my stay in Toronto."}
{"text":"our friends refereed us to this restaurant . once we arrived we saw a note that the place will be closed for 2 weeks. I checked their website the night before and I did not see any notification.  We went to Sharzad  ( next door) which is the grill section of Pomegranate restaurant  and is own by same owner.  The waiters are road.  Food is pricey with compare of what u get  the washroom is tiny and dirty ( It reminds u of road washroom u see in Iran roads ) Do not take kids with yourself  Very tiny u cant breath    I guess Iranian friends recommend this place since it has nice tradition decoration so u fool  yourself that food is good too. Well, I did not go their to eat just the decoration ! As I worked in downtown, I have tried different restaurant but this one was the worst so far...  I can say for sure Persian take out I ate in North York are much more better that the garbage this restaurant serve."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here based on the reviews.  Really enjoyed my meal.    The lamb stew special was fabulous.  Favourable, with tender meat and a variety of mushrooms, accented with tiny pickled grapes that contrasted beautifully with the rich lamb.  Our meals were nicely presented with well-cooked rice and 2 salads.  The flavours of the rice and salads complimented the stew and rounded out the meal.  Appreciated the friendly and efficient service provided in a team approach.   Our experience was enhanced by this.  Great to see how popular this spot is.  We arrived early and saw it fill up quickly.  The decor added to our experience.  Many beautiful pieces on the walls set the tone and give a peak into Persian culture.  Felt we received good value for the quality and portion size.  It is a cozy restaurant, so don't expect a lot of space between the tables.  I will definitely visit again and look forward to trying out the sister restaurants as well."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. I will never go to pomegranate again. The guy named Daniel had a terrible customer service for us. The food came late,tasteless and cold ! During the meal no one came to check if we need anything !! And ofcourse ridiculously expensive. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"I couldn't find my friends when I first walked in ... because they were around the corner, seated cross-legged, sock-footed on an elevated platform covered with Persian rugs and cushions! Being a sucker for novelty, that got things started off on the right foot for me.   The vegetarian fesenjaan I ordered was pretty good -- a thick stew with a complex flavour made with portobello and button mushrooms and pomegranate -- however, the rest of the dish was unabashed filler. To accompany the stew was half-heartedly seasoned white rice with a pile of salad and a cup of salsa fresca (?!). Aside from the fesenjaan itself, I wasn't impressed, but my perceptions might have been different given better presentation.  For dessert, we split the plate of assorted Persian sweets, which left a better taste in my mouth than my entr√©e, literally and figuratively. I'm hard-pressed to name what it was or describe it (website isn't any help), but it's certainly worth trying.  The entire restaurant is beautifully decorated with Persian rugs, tiles and assorted objets d'art. Coupled with the dim lighting, it's a good place to impress a date with your worldliness, and if you really hit it off, you won't even notice the culinary shortcomings.  My socks are far from being knocked off, but I'm intrigued enough by the food and others' glowing Yelp reviews to want to give it another go sometime."}
{"text":"I've noticed this place in \"the hood\" for a while now and have always wondered at why there would be a line-up for a fruit market.  On a quieter night, I stopped in to see what was the big stink.  As it turns out this is not a fruit market, but is in fact an Arabian restaurant.  I gave it a shot!  They (kind staff) recommended the meat, which I was told was sheep and was soft in my mouth.  There was a lot of white yogurt which I enjoyed more than cottage cheese, which I do not like.  A pleasant surprise, and the good news was that I got to eat pomegranate seeds also!  \"Why not?\" I say!"}
{"text":"4/5! Recommend the eggplant dip to start, and the chicken stew and lamb shank polo as mains. We would definitely go back or try one of the sister restaurants"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite restaurant in the GTA!  If you're into lamb, the morasa polo is the best!  The chicken fesen jaan is also highly recommended.  If you are going on a date and want some romance, ask to sit on the back tact."}
{"text":"My favorite Persian restaurant in Toronto. I tried almost every thing and all food tastes perfect. Appetizers are must to try!"}
{"text":"I'm Persian, so I've had plenty of experience eating at other Persian restaurants both in Iran and in California. Persians pride themselves on hospitality-- that means that families and restaurant owners go out of their way to make their guests feel welcome-- even unexpected or late guests. This was not the experience here.   I was in Toronto for a conference this last October. My colleagues had heard good things about this restaurant, so we decided to book a table. Be forewarned-- they are a small restaurant that is not accommodating to a dinner party size that increases by 1-2 people. Two colleagues and I came 20 minutes later than the rest of the group. They refused to serve any hot foods to 2 out of 3 of us because we were seated at a different table. \"Our small kitchen can not accommodate any additional people at the 6pm serving.\" We could choose only from their cold appetizer selection. The appetizers we did order-- the kashka badamjan (eggplant dip) and mirsa gahsame (eggplant with egg dip) both didn't taste right. They were bland, and not very flavorful. These dishes are usually serves warm, with warm/ toasty bread. The fesanjan (pomegranate walnut sauce) also didn't taste quite right (again very bland) and was very watery.   I would not recommend coming here if you wanted real Persian food. That being said, 1/2 of my non-Persian colleagues, who had never tasted Persian food, seemed to like what they ordered."}
{"text":"Such a amazing place and food. Taste like real Persian foods. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"A true 5 starts for one of the finest restaurant in Toronto.   I live in New York City but every time when we visit Toronto my husband and I love to eat there.   The ambiance is warm and welcoming, the decor is very nicely done, pictures of Iranian poets, painting, Persian calligraphy, lighting everything make you feel you like to stay there eat and chat.    Even though both my husband and I love the food in the menu but we love to hear and order whatever the chef cooked that day and believe me there is always a new twist to the same food.  My personal favorite is \"Boz Ghorme\" beef stew with Kashk and eggplant served with basmati rice, it is divine and to die for. This is one one of the few places I am so happy I am not vegetarian!!!!!!!    Adas Polo(lentil with basmati rice), Gheyme and Fesenjoon are fantastic too.  Trust me whatever you order will be fantastic."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten here - but I do hear that the food is excellent. Every time I call to make a reservation they talk to me like they're doing me a favor - \"oh, you can have the table for 7:30 but you'll have to leave by 8:30.\" Maybe I'm being overly sensitive but it's such an off putting way to go about your business. I'm sure they're doing fine without me, but still - maybe they'd do even better business if they didn't greet you by telling you when you had to leave."}
{"text":"if you like Persian food or any kind of middle eastern food you will love this place. It is a small restaurant, not too many seatings, but very nicely decorated and wonderful service. the food is really tasty. I love the eggplants and the lamp. to be very honest, everything we tasted was very good. very casual so dont dress up"}
{"text":"Olive and pomegranate appetizer was out of this world. The price is higher but the portions are ridiculous to match! Get reservations or get there early. They close earlier than you'd think they close. I've been disappointed two nights before I finally was able to plan ahead and eat at this tasty restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the nicest decor ever - it totally gives you the feel of a Persian/Middle Eastern culture. The food was tasty and the service was superb! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"TASTY!  A small cozy place with beautiful persian decor.  I almost always ordered the moraso polo, jewelled basmati rice with braised lamb shank. My favorite dish!  But, special of the day always sound so good! For appertizer, zeitoon, an olive paste with lot of garlic, and, dolmeh, stuffed vine leaves, are just delightful! All dishes are fairly price. They are always busy, so, I always call ahead."}
{"text":"Daniel is loveliest ever and all the girls working there are very nice and they know how to serve.   The food is amazing and being there is like you are home."}
{"text":"If food reminiscent of an Iranian university cafeteria is what you're after, look no further. Pomegranate serves up mediocre renditions of Iranian favourites, complete with waitresses wearing \"Free Palestine\" bracelets. I mean, can we at least EAT in peace without needing a side of politics?  Appetizer dips leave much to be desired; Dolmeh was a tad better than the canned grocery store version.   * Ghormeh Sabzi reminded me of a version I had eaten at a fast food joint in Tehran. (2/10) * Fesenjaan was a bit better but still not even remotely close to the real thing. (4/10) * Lamb stew special - nothing Persian about it, but perhaps that's why it was the best thing our party ordered that evening. (6/10)  Desserts were rather good, and the decor was nice, both a saving grace for Pomegranate, and landing it a very generous 2-STARS."}
{"text":"The food was ok but nothing extraordinary. Their 1.5 hour rotation policy is ridiculous, particularly as they refused to bring dessert and basically told us to hurry and get out. Totally unprofessional and completely rude, as we waited 10 minutes for our table to be ready and service could be faster."}
{"text":"I ordered the Dolmeh as an appetizer, the Qeymeh for mains and the Rose Water ice cream for dessert (forget the actual name). The Dolmeh was good but the Qeymeh was not for me. The taste wasn't anything particularly delicious; it was just a dish I continued eating because it was dinner. Perhaps I'm not able to appreciate Persian stews so I won't put this one on the restaurant. The dish consisted of a lamb and lentil stew, some rice, a tomato salad and a mixed greens salad. The mixed green salad had several wilted spinach and I was disappointed by the lack of effort put in to selecting the leafs for something which only really consists of leaves. I still had hope, in case the dessert made up for the meal. It did, only somewhat. The ice cream tasted good and it was even better with cinnamon sprinkled on top of it. The issue with it however, was that it was pretty much frozen solid. I had to almost cut into it rather than being able to scoop some out. The service wasn't anything spectacular either. Overall, the restaurant didn't meet my expectations and the best part of the dining experience was the decor."}
{"text":"The customer service was very bad, the waitress couldn't take our order and had to keep asking the owner. There was no explanation of the food when it was served. The apps were just quickly left in the corner of the table. The food was okay, nothing special. The ambience was really nice, and smell was delicious, but unfortunately the other factors gives this a 2 star."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Great veggie options (four of us ordered different things and shared), super cool people, and fairly inexpensive.  Would eat there again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The best persian food you can imagine! Friendly and kind servers, authentic decore, very delicious food (it really can compete with the best homemade dishes I have had  in Iran), reasonably priced.  It is usually fully booked, so make a reservation in advance, especially if your group is larger than 4."}
{"text":"Thanks to the reviews here, we decided to try this place when we came into Toronto.    We were looking particularly for a Middle-eastern place where the three of us could comfortably sit and converse over dinner. I say this because my spouse and I (as well as the friend we were with) are all partial to good food first/good dining second, but we wanted a more relaxing atmosphere than some of the excellent-food-but-the-folding-chairs-are-hard places we are happy to patronize when we're taking food home.  Pomegranate is a cozy restaurant which welcomes you in under traditional tile work lintels and an interior that has just enough Persian touches to set a tone without going overboard.   We came in early-ish for dinner (around 6:30), but the place was already filling up and we did promise to be out by 8:00, when reservations would take over our table.  I was pleased at the beer and wine selection, which seemed thoughtfully selected for flavor and variety.  Then there was the food. It was delicious. The offerings were interesting and stayed away from the \"meat on a stick\" variety.  The kashk-e bademjaan, a charred eggplant, was rich and smoky, filling your mouth with a wonderful blend of flavor.  The babari bread was hearty enough to hold the appetizer, without taking over the taste.  I had the aloo gheysi, a wonderful chicken saffron stew with plums and apricots, while my friend had a special that evening, a lamb stew and eggplant with beet.  Our meals arrived nicely plated, the stews in a bowl on the plate next to a really nice saffron-tipped pilau. Each of us had a slice of the crunchy bits from the bottom.    The chicken was marvelous. Tender chunks of meat in a rich whey-saffron sauce, the dried apricots and bokharan plums adding tart and sweet to the palate (be warned - the plums are not pitted).    The lamb was equally delicious, but coming from a different end of the taste buds. Aromatic, with a strong (but pleasant) taste of lamb countered by the smokiness of the eggplant, its flavors complemented the tart-sweet of the chicken.   I would definitely return to this restaurant, and work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Time: 8pm-ish Dec 23rd, made reservations but did not need them- effing freezing weather outside  Ambiance: SO CUTE, persian poetry border on the walls, ethnic-y table cloths, little candles, very warm and cozy  Service: Waiters a bit inattentive, took forever to get the cheque  Food:  Starter: Shared Eggplant with tomato-y stuff and flatbread- a little oily but AMAZING! Entree: got lamb morasa polo, so tender falling off bone, but a little bland, saffron rice with orange peel, pomegrates, nuts were yummy Dessert: shared mixed sweet platter dessert- lacy dough in rosewater (i did not enjoy), pistachio and sweet stuff was kind of like peanut brittle, chickpea cookies were melt in my mouth powdery goodness  I want to come here again and try other things!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely make reservations!  My fav is beef koobideh and the tea   xoxo M."}
{"text":"Strangely enough, the best Iranian restaurant in GTA is run by White folks! I haven't had such good food even in Iran!"}
{"text":"Pomegranate is a popular downtown spot for anyone looking for Persian food (particularly stews).  I actually didn't know that they had a sister restaurant next door that served up kebabs.  I often order kebabs, so I'll have to check out Sheherzade some time.    We started with the dolmeh (2.95 for 4 pieces).  They are so simple but probably one of my favourite appetizers.  Vine leaves were stuffed with rice and herbs, deliciously citrusy.   A lot of people were ordering the kashk-e bademjaan (6.95).  A warm eggplant dip with garlic, walnuts, topped with delicious fried onions and served with a basket of fresh bread.  It was good but not stand-out.    For my main, I ended up ordering one of their specials which was a boneless lamb stew with eggplant and beets (14.95).  The stew was aromatic and the lamb was fall-apart tender.  The beets added a lot of colour and sweetness to the stew. Pretty fantastic!  Dessert was awesome!  I ordered the ice cream (5.50) and it was huge!  Enough for four people or two very large ice cream eaters.  The ice cream looked a lot like cheesecake but it was less creamy and more icy.  It was white in colour but packed full of the flavour of sweetened rose water.  It was garnished with sliced pistachios and pomegranate seeds.  A surprising  and unique mix of colours, tastes, and textures.  If you are coming here as a group, they generally don't do groups larger than 8.  Also, no separate bills.  However, the service was still great and I would love to come back and try another one of their stews!"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmmm good!! One of my new favourite restos!  Had dinner here for the first time last night. We arrived at 8pm and the place was about half full and filled up quickly.  Reservations are strongly recommended. I love the decor and atmosphere of the place.  I was debating between ordering one of their specials of the day and the qeymeh so I asked our server about her recommendation.  She really sold me on the qeymeh and I was happy to find someone that was so passionate about the food and knowledgable as well.  Qeymeh is a lamb stew with lentils and dried lime and it was oh so mouthwateringly delicious!  The lamb was cooked perfectly, tender and not too gamey tasting.  Went very well with the lentils and there was a nice tang from the dried lime. Served with saffron rice, green salad and shirazi (diced cucumber, tomato and onion salad).  You can add a side of yogourt for $1.  It's about a 1 cup serving and is enough to share between 2 people (unless you like to smother your meal with it!). For dessert, our table of 3 ordered the rosewater ice cream and 1 sweet plate sampler with 3 different kinds of sweets/cookies.  The rosewater ice cream is a large portion so totally shareable.  It has a delicate but intense flavour.  It was too perfumey and overpowering for one of our party but I really enjoyed it.  The sweet plate was also very tasty though be advised, the short bread cookie is also very fragrant.  I believe it was scented with cardamom and I really liked it but again, one of our party found it to be too overpowering.  The servers took a bit longer to take our orders but the food arrived fairly quickly after that.    Pomegranate exudes a kind of warmth and familiarity that I really enjoyed and I'm sure I will be dreaming about my meal here for the next couple of weeks.  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is very good. Probably the best Persian restaurant in Toronto. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered here has been fantastic.  I tend to take people who are visiting Toronto here because I know it will deliver on taste, service and ambiance.   If you are looking for real Persian food, this is the place! The meat is always done to perfection and if you mix butter into the rice, it pulls out even more of the aromas and flavours.  I would recommend a reservation-it is a busy busy place! If you can't get a reservation-their sister restaurant is next door and also a 5-star place"}
{"text":"Delicious. Healthy, authentic complex flavours with all the right spices and tangy notes. All entree dishes came with salad(s) and rice! My friend and I made a reservation Friday evening, and both the restaurant and our bellies were full by the time we left! Would definitely come back and recommend to friends for Persian cuisine :)"}
{"text":"A solid choice for Persian cuisine. Consistent quality...  Probably the best of this kind you can find in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was recommended by my good friend. It was delicious, healthy and beautiful food. Make sure to make a reservation - and keep in mind that this place opens for dinner. Order the specials because it is tasty and you cannot go wrong with what is recommended for the day. I had lamb, and another dish with pomegranate. It was well made and it looks like something that's made for a special person :) good food, happy stomach!   +good for taking your teacher out for thank you!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Persian food at a restaurant.The portions are huge for the price and quality of food is amazing. I just wished they used more saffron for the rice because I couldn't taste it at all. I got the Fesenjan, it was really good and other people at the table really like the lamb shanks. Noon-o-paneer-o gerdoo was a really good choice for appetizer (it was flavourful, healthy, and light!). For dessert, the ice cream is completely frozen, so you will have to wait a bit for it until you can use your spoon. It's extra rich and you can really tell that it's homemade.  The restaurant got packed at around 7:00 pm (we went mid week) and there was a line-up for the tables so make sure to make a reservation in advance!"}
{"text":"Dinner   Ambience: 4/5   Food: 3.5/5 (Notes: ice cream was memorable) Service: 3/5 (Friendly) Value: 3/5  Repeat: Perhaps."}
{"text":"I came here for a work dinner and was really looking forward to it. Overall, not a bad experience. However, I've had a lot better Persian food.  The appetizers were good; we had one of the 4 yogurt plates, which was tasty and then the kashk-e bademjaan, which I loved but then also dolmeh, which I'm not crazy about and it doesn't matter where it's from (Greece, the Middle-East!) and also zeitoon parvardeh, the tapenade. Also not my favourite thing. But the bread was good. I wish they had brought enough for all of us to enjoy and finish the appetizers.  We then had our mains. I had the special, which was lamb with aubergine in a delicious sauce. Can't remember. Served with rice and salad. The lamb and rice were wonderful, but my goodness, they put a lot of lemon (and nothing else) on the leaves/cucumber salad. While it may have helped with digestion, it didn't do anything for my taste buds. The mint tea was great for after, but it would have been nice to have been offered dessert. And we weren't. More like 2.5 stars than 3. Not in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"After much anticipation, i finally got to try Pomegranate. I'm saddened to tell you that I did not like the dishes at this restaurant... which was disappointing because I generally love trying new types of cuisine and flavors. I should mention that this was my first time trying Iranian food so my palette may not be used to the different flavors.  We ordered the chicken in the pomegranate-based stew and the lamb in lentils stew. I was content with the lamb dish (however, it was under-salted) but the chicken dish was way too sweet. It was an unpleasant balance of sweetness and tartness which did not deliver.   I also ordered the doogh drink which was a strange salty yogurt drink adorn with dashes of spices and nuts. Again, it was hard to drink as the flavor combination was too foreign.   The servers were very nice and enthusiastic, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday with a group of 8 people.  The staff were very friendly, and were attentive.  They gave us plenty of time to pick our order, which was perfect!  The food was really good - they have a good selection of vegetarian food, too.  I think everyone really enjoyed their meal.  One person felt that the restaurant was overpriced, however the rest of us thought that it was very reasonably priced.  There was so much food, that there were leftovers for me to take home!"}
{"text":"Delicious!    Entrees were reasonably sized and priced at $14.95.  Quality excellent.    I had the morasa polo which is described as  \"jewelled rice - slivers of seville orange peel, almond and pistachio with diced carrots and barberries blended in saffron basmati rice served with a braised lamb shank \"  The rice was simply amazing ... I am still thinking about it now.    My husband ordered the adas polo - \"lentils, dates and sultana raisins blended into a saffron basmati rice topped with crispy onion with barberries\"  I had a bite of his and definitely liked mine a lot better.  His rice had an overwhelmingly onion-y taste.  He loved his rice but admitted there were too many raisins.  The only complaint I can think of with my dish was that I wish the portion was bigger ... but now I am just being greedy.  Ordered two appetizers as well - the dolmeh - rice wrapped in grape leaves and the vegetarian caviar.  Both were pretty good but kind of pricey for the amount served.  The pomegranate juice is \"meh\" and overpriced.  I think the POM juice is A LOT better.    You need to make reservations at this place.  We were almost turned away even though we arrived at the restaurant at 5:30 - and the restaurant opens at 5:00.  Great place for a date - very cozy and intimate.  Not really appropriate for kids ... whoops :("}
{"text":"Amazing! I had braised lamb that was so good it just fell off the bone -- seriously, I ate it with a fork and spoon + beautiful Persian rice with orange peel, pomagrante and piatachios. Special food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Unique food that took me years to finally get out to the place and then the first time I decided to go, they were full. Persian is popular- plan ahead and make a reservation.  For vegetarians, the entree's are unique, but I'm not sure it's the type of food I crave. Pomegranate seeds and walnut sauce make up the most of what I remember. Didn't opt for dessert. Too many great restaurants in the city to focus on persian."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was higher expectations given the ratings on yelp or the fact that we've eaten lots of similar but much better (and cheaper) food in Montreal, but my wife and I were very disappointed by our food here.  The atmosphere is nice, and the price is good, this is true.  However, the food was flavorless.  Decent quality ingredients (except the not-so-good cut of lamb), with very interesting sounding mixes, but somehow poorly executed.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Just a really good, unpretentious, homestyle Persian restaurant. I'm sure if I had a Persian grandma this would be the food she'd be cooking. The jeweled rice and various lamb stews are delicious. Only shortcoming for us was the spinach dip appetizer - barbary bread was hot and tasty but the dip was a pretty generic cold cream cheese-like dish.   Overall, food tastes very \"clean\" if that makes sense, not overloaded with salt and fats like you often get eating out. Prices are super reasonable too."}
{"text":"Most of our group had never had Persian food, and only one had been to Pomegranate before, so this was definitely a new experience!  They had two daily specials for $14.99 each, both lamb, one being a lamb stew with beets, fava beans, and parsnips, alongside their regular rice & salad combo. This had a good flavor and was on the runnier side, so you def needed to have rice with it. Slightly oily from fatty lamb but I was ok with that :p  The FENSENJAAN was quite lovely - praised by the repat customer of our group but too rich for another member, what with the walnut base of the stew  The ALOO GHEYSI had a good balance of tartness and sweetness, which I found ok as I'm not so much a fan of the sweet&salty combo  The ADAS POLO with lamb shank had fall-off-the-bone meat, which I didn't try, but heard to be cooked well, however there didn't seem to be any particular spices/seasoning to it. The main part of this dish that shined was the rice, which was enjoyable.  The only thing that none of our group was a fan of: the salted, carbonated yogurt drink with mint. I'm not sure I tasted any of the mint but the yogurt/carbonation combo did not sit well with my palate..  The staff was super friendly and accommodating for our group of 9 (we had made reservations), even though a couple of us were running late and wanted to hold off on ordering, and even though there was another large group booked for the table a couple hours later  Gorgeous decor, great service, reasonable prices - i def wouldn't mind coming back again :)"}
{"text":"The wait staff is beyond rude.  We asked for more bread three times and gladly offered to pay for it.  The waitresses had to turn to face our table to walk passed because the place is so over crowded.  She passed is 30 times but no bread.  My food was too sweet and I wanted the bread for the salt.  Finally when they cleared the plates, I said that we had asked for bread 20 minutes ago.  She had forgotten us and so had the other waitress we asked.  The waitress offered to bring bread, but at this point I would have had to eat alone in front of everyone because she had cleared the plates.  The waitress didn't even apologize.  I was really looking forward to the rose ice cream, but by now had a bad taste in my mouth about the restaurant.  I asked the group if we could go somewhere else for desert or more drinks, and everyone agreed.  I will not return.  They don't respect their customers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! The place is very cozy and fun, and the food is just amazing. It is also reasonably priced. The staff are very nice and do their job very well despite the place being rather busy most of the time."}
{"text":"This place serves excellent Persian food. I don't eat Persian too often, but this place definitely satisfied my middle eastern taste buds. Had the morassa polo along with the noon-o-panneer o-gerdu. Scrumptious. Staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Tasty and authentic Iranian food! I ordered the house special which consisted of a lamb stew with lime and although it was a bit sour for me, the lime flavour did not overpower the meal and the lamb was extremely tender. I would definitely recommend ordering the Mirza Qasemi as the eggplant flavour was amazing! As well as the maast-o Khiar which had a nice crunch to the yogurt from the cucumbers. However the bread to dip ratio was way off and we had to ask for more bread a few times in order to finish the dips so a good tip would be asking for extra bread right off the bat! For dessert the rose flavoured ice cream is fantastic and a large portion that is great for 2-4 people to share."}
{"text":"Good Persian food with nice and friendly atmosphere. The zeitoon-parvardeh wasn't the best I've tried but the stews are very good"}
{"text":"After having a set a high bar for grilled items at their sister concern next door I was looking forward to this spot. We were running a bit late so I was kinda starving when I arrived. The place was packed and they gave us a corner seat as that was the only table left.  After going through the menu we ordered the following maast-o khiar for app, morasa polo and fesenjaan with chicken as mains. The menu is focused mainly on rice dishes from what I could tell.  The app arrived and looked appetizing with a bit of color which is kinda the signature for this cuisine. The yogurt was very light the raisins and walnuts added a nice taste texture to this simple dish. Now for the main they did come with a side of salads which was very bland. The shank though tender was bit cold and was a small portion. Rice was very good. The chicken dish was poor with very little chicken and it seemed like it was later added to the dish and not cooked together. The rice on the side was again quite good but didn't save this dish. They do even have the seating where one can feel like getting the royal treatment on the Takht (Daybed) so if you enjoy that kind of thing by all means give it a try and call ahead for a reservation. Personally I would rather go to their spot next door sans the Takht."}
{"text":"Ate: Spinach borani, eggplant puree  Drank: Various beers  Liked: Food was delicious, decor was cool.  Disliked: Service was pretty slow.  Chicken:   Would mom like it?: Unlikely.  Would I go back:  Unlikely.  Recommend: Eh."}
{"text":"Great place for persian \"khoresht\"  (stews)  very authentic flavors and pleasant staff!"}
{"text":"This is probably the most famous Persian restaurant in Toronto, always busy for a small place! I love the decor, it reminds me of home lol. The music and the atmosphere is amazing. The service was also really good. The waitresses speak Persian even though they're white. The food is amazing obviously! I've pretty much tried every dish and they're all fabulous. KEEP IN MIND that this place serves traditional Persian food, so no kabobs!!"}
{"text":"The main dishes are pretty good, but your experience will be ruined by the slowest, most inefficient waiting staff in the city.   I asked for the bill, and it took 35 minutes while they milled about."}
{"text":"Both Pomegranate and Sheherzade, two doors down, are owned by the same family. They are both Persian restaurants but serve different styles of food.  This location offers you more traditional home style Persian cuisine. The kind of food you would find in someone's home over in Iran. Alternatively, their other location serves the kind of street food you would find in a bazaar.  The food is truly great at both of their locations and you will see that the owners of these two restaurants are super passionate about the food from their home country."}
{"text":"Enjoyed going here on a Thursday evening, the place was lively but not too crowded. We were seated beside some customers who had reserved a bed that you could eat on, which seemed pretty cool if you're into that. The food was a little pricey but very reasonable for the portions that you get. The service was pretty great, and the food was good as well. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The place is double booked on every table so they give you a table for 2 hours only. There are only 2 waitresses that never come and ask you what you need and you basically need to beg for water. Service is super slow and you get your food too late and they kick you out at 2 hours point before you even finish your food. The manager was extremely rude when we complained and handles it terribly. Food is only ok. Nothing special. My friends and I will never go back and will spread the word for sure."}
{"text":"Too bad you cannot give zero stars or even negative stars, because this is what this place deserves. Pomegranate cannot be an authentic Middle Eastern restaurant  Middle Eastern culture prides itself in hospitality, and this concept is unknown to Pomegranate servers. I was meeting a friend in there. When I stepped in, instead of somewhat welcome, a server informed me that there are no tables and she cannot help me. what she did not say is that there were tables close to the bar, and I could have gone and looked for my friend there (who was there already). Fast forward and being reunited with the friend, I sit down and no apologies, no nothing. they promptly ignore me for 10 minutes, then the same server comes to take my order and literally rushes me. I ask about drinks, and she snaps that they have no ciders (I asked if they had them) and they she would give me a menu to look. Huh?  I ordered fesenjaan with chicken. It comes with a huge rice portion, but the stew itself had 4 tiny chicken pieces; the stew was ok but the taste was on a sweet side. It seemed very unbalanced. The \"best\" part of the night started when I was half way through my meal. A bill came in abruptly. The servers started referring to some \"deal\" they made with my friend, and that we had to leave by 7:55. It was 7:50 pm. I was asked if I wanted to pack my meal with me. Excuse me? I am not done. They repeated 10 times that they really needed the table. This is just unacceptable, and if you do need the table that bad, how about remind people 10 minutes before they have to leave. We did leave at 8:03 after paying for the meal and leaving zero tips. We did not experience any service there, so that was fair, but the servers became even more rude, and completely ignored all my comments. Nobody cared even to attempt to apologize. Obviously, I am not coming back, and I suggest that you always take your money elsewhere, unless you want to have a mediocre meal and be kicked out of the restaurant because the next party has arrived."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful place with amazing Kebobs and dizi! Love the taste and the atmosphere yet I didn't give it a 5 star rating because of the price! It is very expensive to eat at this restaurant , don't get me wrong the food is good yet it's just typical persian food , nothing extra special ! It's too expensive in my opinion and if you have a party of 4 people they will charge you services on the bill whether u like it or not!"}
{"text":"I started to write a review about another restaurant, and realized that no middle eastern restaurant can hold a candle to Pomegranate.  This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.  Reason being - I love variety and complexities in my food.  The use of different spices, meats, fruit - it is foodgasm over and over.  The decor - amazing.  I just *sigh* can't even express how beautiful this spot is and how I have only been there once (shame on me!!!).    Pomegranate, I will be back soon, I promise!!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends and one of whom is Persian. The place was small some say cozy but I dont really go to a restaurant for the decor.  We got 2 appetizers the first was maast-o khiar which consists of yogurt, walnut, raisins and rose petals. I didn't really like because I am not a big yogurt fan but my friends liked it. The second appetizer was kashk-e bademjaan which is charred eggplant, persian whey, garlic and walnuts topped with crispy onion. I liked this one thought it did taste some what similar to bhabha ghanouj and an indian appetizer called aloo bangan. Both appetizers came with the light and fluffy babari bread which is the tradional persian bread.  The entree that I got was called fesenjaan chicken (a smooth rich stew of ground walnut and pomegranate syrup served beside a plate of saffron basmati rice). The dish reminded me of some type of indian dish due to the fact that the sauce was very thick and oily. Nonetheless it was very tasty the  pomegranate syrup really added to the balance of the dish as it gave it some sourness  Overall I would recommend this place but don't expect to be taken in a new food experience. However my Persian friend was impressed with the food as it was quite similar to the food they eat back home.  Food - 3/5 Recommendations - Fesenjaan or baqali polo"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time at Pomegranate tonight. The staff were very friendly and the food was tasteful. We had zeytoon parvarde, kashk bademjoon and their special, morgh-e torsh. They were all good and presented well. I also liked their interior design, makes you feel cozy and comfortable. I would definitely come back next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Remember when you saw that Monet painting up close and you realized that it's just made out of little dots of paint?  And then you took a few steps back and saw how wonderful it really was.  Eating here is a bit like that.    This place offers a nice range of stews and spreads of various blends served with rice and breads.  The menu deliberately avoids items that require a lot of last minute prepping or plating.  Whatever you order, you think to yourself, hmm, I could make that.  However, as you eat, you uncover further layers of flavour.  Your initial guesses at the combinations are thrown out and eventually you just stop guessing.    Making these recipes seems simple enough for anyone with a blender and a slow cooker.  But getting all the subtlies in place could take a life time."}
{"text":"I've lived in LA and New York and am a native Persian. I haven't had food like this in all of the U.S. When you walk in you feel like your in an original Persian tea house. The service is spectacular and the attention to detail is incredible. Things that someone who wasn't Persian may not notice but believe me work went into the decorations and the menu. The food is unreal. I hadn't even heard of some things but my parents couldn't stop talking about how they hadn't seen this food since they were in Iran. Get the kashke bademjan for sure. Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. Every time we visit we try to get a reservation in advance (we are not always lucky, and those visits suck). They have an amazing menu, and their specials are so unique and delicious!  Every aspect of dining here is excellent. The decor, music and ambiance transport you to the middle east and create an exotic backdrop for your dining experience.   The service is solid, even when they are very busy (which is pretty much always). Every time we have dined here we have been one small table in a full dining room, with only two servers working the room. Amazingly the food comes out pretty fast, and the servers are very attentive.   On my last visit, we were there for Valentine's weekend (the weekend before Valentine's day). Not only was the place totally packed, but we witnessed 6 couples get turned away because reservations were full. So, reservations are HIGHLY recommended.   I have eaten most things on the main menu, but here are the stand-outs for me personally:  --The 'noon-o paneer-o gerdu' appetizer is so delicious! Enough for two people to share, it is basically, olives, cheese, herbs, walnuts and bread. I try to take a little of everything in each bite to savor how the flavors all meld together. This appetizer, versus some of the others, which are mostly dips, has more depth and complexity, with a variety of textures and ways to combine the various items on the plate in each bite, which means as you eat through it, you can constantly experience something new. Love, love, love.  --The 'fesenjaan', which is a traditional walnut-pomegranate stew with chicken (you can also get a vegetarian version) is amazing. When the nightly specials don't grab us, this is our go-to. The portion is generous, and you get their saffron rice and a side salad on the plate. The entire dish is a feast for the eyes as well as your taste buds. If you aren't sure what to get, get this.  --The 'baqali polo' is basically the Pomegranate-version of braised lamb shanks. The shanks are cooked to perfection, meat falling off the bone, and the rice, combined with the dill and fava beans provides a rich, tangy and just delicious backdrop to the velvety meat. Yum! Makes my mouth water now, weeks later.   Whatever you do, MAKE SURE you leave room for the ice cream at the end. They have this rosewater-saffron-pistachio ice cream which is a great way to end the meal. The serving is large, definitely enough to share. And it is really well balanced between the rose water and saffron flavoring.   Pomegranate also has a great wine list, and the servers are extremely knowledgeable: tell them what you like or ask them to make a recommendation. We have always been very pleased.  Last comment, and perhaps the most important for those of you looking for an outstanding dining experience without breaking the bank: this place is a GREAT value. Most dishes are $16 or under, and for the amount of food you get, the atmosphere and food quality, there is just no way to go wrong. Don't forget to make your reservation though!"}
{"text":"Food is okay (not great) but service was poor.  Called and made a reservation but a little after we sat down (and prior to even ordering) we were told we only had an hour before we'd have to give up our table because of another reso.  This message was delivered  by a manger or owner, who although spoke in a pleasant tone, obviously didn't care how that effected our meal.  We asked for an extra water but it took an hour before it arrived. By the time the food arrived we had about 30 minutes to eat and pay the bill before we had to be out.  We asked for our leftovers to be packed up and realized the next day when we opened it up that all three completely different dishes were just thrown into one container.  This essential made the leftovers inedible since one dish, which needed to be warmed up, was covered in another yogurt dish (which can't be reheated) and also covered in a third dish, which was also supposed to be eaten at room temp.  We've been to this restaurant several times before and have never really had a great experience but this will definitely be the last time we go.  The only saving grace was that the actual server seemed nice,but she may be the one that packed the leftovers."}
{"text":"Interesting menu, and a lot of stews. Came here with a huge group of people for my friends birthday, I had the chicken pomegranate walnut stew, the chicken was beautifully cooked, however i wasn't a huge fan of the stew because it was to tangy for my liking. My friend ordered a lamb dish, it was also cooked very well. Flavours are different and overall the dishes we tried have had some pomegranate which gives it the tangy flavor. at the end we brought our own cake for the birthday girl and when we got the bill, $10 was added as \"open food charge\" and weren't notified before. I thought that was pretty unfair as we could've brought the cake somewhere else and ate it there. Since we came in a big group the automatic gratuity was 18%, didn't think the service was worth that much on top of the $10 they pocketed from just bringing 10 plates out. I don't think I would be back here again."}
{"text":"I have a fatal weakness for food I can't pronounce. It gives me this illusion that I'm on vacation in a different country. Pomegranate Restaurant achieves this goal spectacularly. Most Persian places that I know only sell kebobs and they resemble a fast food chain more than a restaurant. Pomegranate's exquisite decor and menu full of food made with exotic ingredients gives you a truly unique experience.   This place focuses on the lesser known Persian dishes - the stews. They may look strange at first, but I give you my personal guarantee (not sure if that's worth anything to you) that they are super delicious. We had the fesenjaan with mushrooms and the aloo geyhsi. We asked the server how to pronounce them. We forgot already. Both were very exotic flavors to us. The aloo geyhsi has a light sour taste but yet a little savory. The fesenjaan is my favourite though. It's grounded walnut with pomegranate syrup. It's hard to describe because it's a taste I've not encountered yet but I'm sure to remember it from now on.  If you're not used to middle eastern cuisine, note that they don't serve pork. Pomegranate is also unique in that half their menu items have lamb. If you don't like lamb, they have chicken. If you're vegetarian, it's ok because they have a few dishes for you. All dishes come with basmati rice and salad. The Persian style rice is light and fluffy. It goes well with the stew.   The only disappointment is the service (which is something I often overlook because I care mostly about the food) but for your information, it's worth mentioning. We made a reservation, which turned out to be a good idea because the restaurant was almost full. There are 3 staff working that day. It was a little aggravating to see such slow service. It's not a big restaurant and I imagine that ONE highly efficient staff can serve everyone in the restaurant. One of the staff did nothing as far as I can tell. It took a while to bring us our menu. Another staff must have been new because she couldn't even tell us what the daily special is. Plus she forgot to bring us our bread. Only the 3rd staff seemed to do anything meaningful but she's always busy with other customers.   Prices are reasonable. Their mains range from $10-$15. Portion size is good. I can overlook the service because this restaurant is truly one of a kind. I'm not sure where else I can find Persian stews.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"They do a really cool thing here where if you order a glass of wine the waiter will come over and spill it all over you shirt."}
{"text":"I was SO SO SO SO EXCITED to try this place. It was my suggestion for a Friday night out, and everyone was game! We got reservations for 8:30pm (btw - the waitress on the phone was amazing!)... and then it took a little nosedive (for me, anyway).  As a vegetarian, it didn't strike me to maybe check out the menu THOROUGHLY beforehand. There's always vegetarian options, right? RIGHT. Well... while there were some vegetarian options, I found that what I ordered (the vegetarian fesenjaan) was really not for me. It was an amalgamation of mushrooms (liking this so far) doused in syrups (Aye! not for a main dish - nooooooo!). It was extremely sweet and kind of made me gag. I finished the rice plain and kept ordering bread - because if all else fails, carbs are your friends.   On a brighter note, my meat eating friends were licking their plates clean! Yup - so verdict: TRY IT if you eat meat :) and eat before if you have to go and you're a vegetarian!  And on a non-food related note: the decor was amazing - authentic, colorful and just really ethnic."}
{"text":"Words of advice: Make sure you come with a reservation! Having a table beside the door, we saw probably 10-15 groups attempt to get a table without reservation and we heard the bad news each time \"Sorry, our wait list is full ...\" It was also a Friday night so perhaps less busy during the weekdays.  Anyways, I appreciated the authentic decor in the restaurant which came through in the food as well.  I ordered the charred eggplant and tomato dip which came with warm flatbread for dipping.  Great flavours and while there was a warning about it being mildly spicy, I wasn't bothered by any spice (I don't like spicy food).  We shared the apricot and chicken stew, which came with a huge plate of rice with lentils and a side salad.  We ordered another plate of rice with pomegranates and lentils (not realizing the stew was accompanied by so many sides)!  The stew was very sweet with full apricots.  I would have preferred some additional chicken in the dish (or if the stew itself was bigger)!  So many of the dishes on the menu looked so interesting, it was tough to narrow down the choices being just two diners."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and very reasonably priced.  Loved the decor.  Only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of the 5 is because the service could've been a little better.  They took a long time to take our order and to give us our check.  Tthe servers appeared overwhelmed and since we were sitting in the back, we could overhear them constantly complaining about how busy it was (while it was very busy, take the complaints behind closed doors where your patrons can't overhear you!)  I had the morasa polo -- the lamb shank fell off the bone and the jewelled rice complimented the lamb well. The jewelled rice had a number of different components that blended perfectly -- fruity & sweet, salty & nutty.  The flavors were spot on.  My boyfriend had the adas polo with the lamb shank.  The lamb shank was again perfectly cooked and fell off the bone.  The rice again was very flavorful with the lentils, dates, and raisins."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and friends. Overall the experience was good. I'm especially impressed because the staff spoke Farsi very well, although it was not their native language. This is the first time I saw this and was very impressed.  Here's what we had; Adas polo with mahicheh(rice with lamb): 6/10. Personally I didn't like my dish but others with me liked it. The quality was good except I didn't like the mix of sweet and salty flavors in my rice. Zeitoon parvardeh(mashed olives with other seasonings)= 8/10. I got this as an appetizer and I liked it, although I wish it had more olives in it to make it as sour as I usually have it.  Mast moosir(yoghurt)= 9/10. This is a great addition to the bread. Just a bit of salt and you might not have room for dinner (because you'll eat so much) Khoroshte gharch(mushroom stew)= 4/10. This was too oily and bitter. No one from my party liked this dish. Torshak= 8/10. This was tasty and I'd recommend. Saffron icecream with pistachios: 7/10. I really looked forward to this because this is my favorite treat, but I didn't like it here. The tidewater was very overpowering to me, although others enjoyed it very much.  Chai (Persian tea) with zolbiah bamieh: 8/10. This was a nice little dessert but again not the BEST that I've had and I've had many versions of this."}
{"text":"I have not a bad thing to say about the place! And it all started from the prompt (1 min delay) when they called me back after a left a message for a reservation.   You walk in, and it's like you've entered into another world. It's like the old town in Iran. My Iranian friend who was with me told me the script on the walls were from famous poems.  He also told me how the trays they were used are authentic from Iran, handmade. they are heavy too. Impressive.   Because our party reduced from 3 to two, they offered us the loungey daybed area, covered in carpets and beaded pillows.  It was a different experience, but would be improved if the area was a bit more private. It's right beside the cash and entrance to the kitchen. I'm sure every bit of our conversation was heard.   Nevertheless, it was really nice to catch up with a friend in this setting. The food was a bit hard to eat without my back getting sore, but proper pillow adjustments will help.   I digress.   The food was really good. Something different for sure.  The servers were very accommodating to my gluten/diary free diet. They usually serve the dips (I got the charred spicy eggplant $6.50) with flatbread. I asked if they had something else, and offered me TahDig (if they had it, and they did). It's the crunchy rice you find at the pot. I was SO pleased that not only the chinese enjoy this. AND i get to dip it in stuff! What a great idea!  For the entree I got the braised lamb with the lentil, raisins and dates rice ($16.50)  The giant shank was fall of the bone soft and tender. Along with the sweet bits of the rice it was a perfect combination.  For an extra $1 you can get a side of yogurt for dipping.  It also comes with greed salad and a special persian salad which only seemed like tomatoes, onions and chopped cucumbers. Portions are sizable and you will feel good and full, but not stuffed.   For dessert, there was the traditional Persian dessert there come with three different things.  Small, but will fulfill the sweet tooth: chickpea flour cooki (gluten free), fried honey dough (tastes like a saffron greek honey ball but smaller), honey covered almonds and pistachios. $4.50  Now, i came here with the only Persian in the restaurant.  He was not super impressed, and agreed that although it tries hard to be authentic, it lacked the oomph of traditional flavours he's used to back home.  Our theory is that it's definitely catered to westerners, but what ethnic food in Toronto isn't.   I'd still want to come back here. tasty food, good prices. Great date place especially if you can reserve the day bed area. The food didn't blow my mind per say, but it was very good - along with the decor and the great service, it's a place that's other worldly."}
{"text":"We tried their house speciality. The dishes were tasty with unique taste and was not at all similar to parsi Food in India. Decor was very Persian and service was good. I didn't give 5 stars as the server forgot to bring our appetizer. Must go place for trying something different"}
{"text":"I simply cannot think of a place I enjoy more in the city! The atmosphere is cozy and authentic feeling, the servers are wonderful and the food is spectacular. Everything from the stews to the morasa polo, to the custom recommendations they have given me. They accommodate Celiac's and gluten free extremely easily, making me 'rice biscuits' for the dips. I will continue recommending this place and bringing people here!"}
{"text":"what a beautiful ecclectic atmosphere so much beautiful decor.  persian behemian mixed into one.  good service friendly staff.  now i havent had a lot of persian food in my life so its hard for me to judge quality but i have to say that it was delicious and uniquely flavourful.  my bf really enjoyed his meal.  my taste palette was definately up for a surprise. portion wise my bf and i were full with two plates even without appetizer.  portions were goid but a little stingy on the meat.  a lot of sauces though. i would come back and im looking to try other options."}
{"text":"the food was so delicious, it actually made me feel a bit homesick! cosy environment, friendly staff and owners.  there's definitely room for improvement in terms of service. our table wasn't checked on once to see if the food was ok or not, even though it was great!"}
{"text":"UYE Authentic Persian! The SEQUEL!  Not really, it was just me and my buddy doing some chilling and catching up but I still reserved on a Tuesday night anyways since I'm not taking any chances.    Arrive around 7:00pm the place was half full with couples to a larger group of 6 or so.  First thing I noticed was not the decor but my nose smelled of SPICE and I still can't identify it as the longer I stay there the more de-sensitized I became to it.  We were given table options and took the seat across from the DAYBED.  It is a great setting here with a small fish pond to the crafts on the wall and the Persian lettering all around.  I really appreciate whoever came up with the design here.  We began to chat and SCAN the Drink Menu first then the Food Menu afterwards.  I took awhile for our server to come back to us just to get our Drink ordered.  When my friend got his Pomegranate Juice and I got my Doogh 10-15 minutes after ordering, the server did an INSTEAD disappearing act before I can even say Morasa.  After that I knew this will be a longer meal than usual, but fortunately I had my Doogh and lots of catching up to do.  The Doogh was salty as advertised and I'm not a fan but I'm A-OK with it, however my friend dislikes it.  Our server did come back if you were wondering, actually I'm sorry to say it was a different server this time and it was after trying to wave down a third server to take our order.  That third server never did speak to us or even gave a smirk or smile, I want our ORIGINAL server back.  Moving on I got Morasa Polo, where our second server answered while we ordered is that Polo means the Rice portion of the meal.  My friend had the acclaimed Baqali Polo.  The Morasa Polo($14.95)(jewelled rice - slivers of seville orange peel, almond and pistachio with diced carrots and barberries blended in saffron basmati rice served with a braised lamb shank) was flavourful and satisfying not in the supersize portion way.    The Jewelled Rice is worthy of being re-ordered again next time I visit.  The Braised Lamb Shank was super TENDER so I have to wonder how long it took to braise something like that especially since this is Home-Style Persian food.  The electricity bill in Persian per household must be SKYHIGH.  Maybe a slow-cooker for 8 hours?!?  I gave the Polo of Baqali Polo a try but I think I will stick with the Polo of Morasa Polo.  When the meal was done, the bill came pretty fast as my friend and I finally felt SETTLED in and ready to stay the night.    I will only deduct 0.5 *Stars* for the service this night.  Pomegranate for the Decor/Food deserves 4 *Stars*.  This brings their grand total to 3.5 *Stars*."}
{"text":"I ordered the fesenjaan with chicken for my entree, and had the rosewater ice cream for dessert (pictured below).  The fesenjaan is a thick pomegranate and walnut reduction; not soupy like a stew or curry, but not solid either. Its texture was slightly granular and pasty (courtesy of the walnuts). The taste was decidedly unpleasant. The individual ingredients on their own would probably have tasted better; together, it became a blend of poorly paired flavors that didn't complement each other. The chicken was over cooked and dry, the reduction was dry, and the rice was dry. At least it was a large portion!  On the other hand, the rose water ice cream was tasty, not dry, and had nice presentation. My complaint with it was that it was entirely frozen when it arrived, and as such was difficult to eat. My girlfriend and I had to wait for it to melt sufficiently to actually try it at all.   Overall, the atmosphere is pleasant, with an option for one party to dine on a Persian-style bed or divan of sorts. The service was decent, if somewhat inattentive at times. Also, having different servers for drinks and food seems like overkill, and was confusing."}
{"text":"This Place is Great! Very Polite and the Food is Yummy (Typical Persian Food). You'll Definitely Like This Place. Plus the Prices are Reasonable"}
{"text":"This place didn't disappoint. The food was top notch, the d√©cor was great and the service was great. The portions are really big and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"It's not you they're happy to see, it's your money.   Made a reservation for 8pm. We eventually got seated with only a drink and dessert menu. Then, we were forgotten about.  Finally, one of the waitresses (very kind and was the highlight of our \"stay\") said she didn't know if anyone had offered us drinks. The answer to that was \"no\", though it was kind of her to notice we'd been ignored.  At last, a woman who was apparently the manager started pushing the specials. Me, only given a drink and dessert menu, asked if we could order dessert. She told us if we wanted dessert we could order an entree or leave. I understand if you prioritize getting money from people over customer satisfaction, however, she was extremely rude and then disappeared. Not a single smile or ounce of genuine attention from anyone other than the girl who offered us drinks.  After waiting longer, another waitress finally appeared asking if we decided to stay for food. I informed her no one gave us a food menu. At this point, I'd already gotten a very bad taste of this place regarding the service. I certainly did not feel as if my presence was wanted - the most important thing was the money in my pockets.  We were given a food menu, the waitress apologized, but the menu did not appear appetizing (though I admit to being biased as I did not want to give this establishment my money any longer).  We ended up at another spot down the street. It was a bitter experience in an otherwise very sweet day (at three other fantastic restaurants in the area).  P.S. they had fish here and the poor things kept coming to the surface for air. This is a sign of an oxygen problem in that tank as this behaviour shows distress. No stones, no decoration, it was just an empty tank."}
{"text":"Very delicious Persian stew type food. I have been to this place 3/4 times and I always tend to order from their specials. The food is always flavorful and delicious. I would recommend going there for sure ! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic in every way imaginable.   A feast for both your eyes as well as tastebuds with authentic dishes from various regions of Iran made to perfection.   Highly recommend paying attention to unique daily specials, where rare gems are often found."}
{"text":"*I actually ate here two nights in a row during a short trip to Toronto. It was so delicious!  This is the best Persian restaurant I've had the pleasure of eating at in North America.  The restaurant is managed by the same family owners at Sheherazade and Tavoos, three in Toronto.    I had the lamb on jeweled rice with a side salad ($15.95), and on our first visit we also ordered the pomegranate reduction chicken stew (fessenjen).   it was perfect.  the decorations and attention to customer needs and detail were impeccable. so good that we went there again two nights later on our short visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"I was mind blown by the quality and the taste of my food at pomegranate restaurant. I've had persian food one before and it didnt stand out to me as a cuisine I loved but after visiting pomegranate, I'm in love with persian food.   We ordered one of each appetizer to share and everything was super flavourful. Our overall favourite was the eggplant dish. For my main, I got the lamb and mushroom stew and oh boy, I was blown away by the layers and depth of flavours. It came with a super flagrant and fresh rice and a side salad and the whole meal was enough to feed me for two meals.   Overall, super great value and quality and taste for the price! I will be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 2 star because aside from making a fall-off-the-bone lamb, the place lacks a lot in taste. The appies we had which were mostly made with yogurt were extremely plain and simple. We had to add a ton of salt and pepper to give it some flavour. Once again, the meat was good, because it was tender, but it lacked in flavour completely. The only compliment I would give this place is on its different beer selection. I like fruity beers and they seem to have quite the selection. Service was good."}
{"text":"Went to Pomegranate after several years. Last time we went there was more 7 years ago so I was very excited to go back. In case you are not familiar with Persian food, the dishes in general can be divided into two main categories. First, the bbq skewered meats or Kabobs (which is the majority of Persian restaurants and are what people eat when they eat out back home). The other category is the stews and slow cooked meals which are usually the homemade dishes and everyone likes their mom's version. The food at Pomegranate is of the second category. They offer a variety of stewed dishes and they do a great job at that. I'm not going to say I am blown away by the food and flavors because mainly I am used to the way my mom cooks these dishes but the food is definitely good enough to remind me of a meal at a favorite aunt :) Another reason I like Pomegranate, is the atmosphere and decoration with Farsi scripts and poems with many traditional paintings giving the place a warm and cozy feeling.   Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Atmosphere and service: 4.5/5 Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"I ordered: Morasa polo, Akbar mashti ice cream, scoops from everyone else plates lool  +1 Price vs portion:  - Dish looks small but fulfilling  (+2) Taste + food presentation  - Delicious free bread, sooo good  Morasa polo: - Steaming rice and meat - Fresh and well washed salad, nice sour dressing - Dried fruits and herbs in rice was creative  Akbar mashti - highlight of the night - nice delicious \"soap\" taste (NOT a negative) - pomegranates, pumpkin seeds, etc complimented nicely  Other dishes that I got couple spoons of: - Not really distinctive, all are salad + rice + meat + curry  + 1  setting + customer service - friendly greetings - quick bread refill - quick water refills - server asked about the meal - helpful when spilled water  -1 No wow factor but you will not be disappointed   Recommendation for a great meal: 1. Come before rush hour 2. Ask about the sourness"}
{"text":"Wow, this was a great stop. Of course, if you happen to be dining here with friends who are familiar with Iran and Persian cuisine more generally, it's even cooler. For example, one of my dining companions who was from Iran commented to the chef about the fine details of preparing fesenjaan (he preferred it cooked for hours and hours) while I just ate everything placed before me with the revelatory gusto of someone whose only other Central Asian eating experience was at the famous Helmand, a Karzai family-owned, Afghani restaurant in Mount Vernon, Baltimore (there is one in Boston, too). I ordered the lamb and had some great Shiraz as an accompaniment, then sipped an orange-scented tea with my desert. Superb."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was fantastic. They don't have many vegetarian options but there's a few delicious choices.  The dessert plate had some delicious and unique flavours. Not too heavy either.  The biggest downside is the size. I recommend making a reservation before you go to guarantee a table."}
{"text":"I'd never had Persian cuisine before, so I was excited to take my mum to Pomegranate for the full experience!  The decor is beautiful; ornate hand painted tiles, incredible pendents and glass blown chandeliers, and rich tapestries fill the room. I was showed to a lovely table by the window beside a creepy indoor  fish pond GAG. I admitted to the waitress I have a THING about fish (I avoid the Mandarin like the plague), and she kindly accommodated my request for another table. Diners were all sorts, typically fairly casual.  Mum was late for our dinner date, so I had a CHAI TEA $2.50 while I waited.  Served with sugar cubes on an ornate little gold plated set up, this was as delicious as it was beautiful.  Mum arrived. We both ordered the same wine, which was really good, I think it was a Chilean Merlot?  Started by splitting the SPINACH BORANI $4.25 Delicious fresh tasting yogurt dip served with addictive salty bread (they gave us a second helping of the bread for the rest of our dip, sweet!). While delicious, this dish is kind of a glorified spinach dip; if you're looking to expand your horizons with new cuisine, I'd recommend trying another appetizer.     Entrees are all around $14, and are served with rice, greens, and an AWESOME cucumber/tomato salad called SHIRAZI. So much food!!  I had the FENSENJAAN - thick stew of ground walnuts and pomegranate syrup with mushrooms (also available with chicken). Very heavy but so yummy and tangy, and the pomegranate seeds throughout are just beautiful.  Mum had the ALOO GHEYSI - chicken stew with plums and apricots. Tasty, but a little too light and fruity without strong flavours to anchor it. Good but I preferred mine.    All in all, a beautiful meal in a beautiful restaurant with kind service.  And a beautifully FULL BELLY at a beautiful PRICE!"}
{"text":"A solid cozy authentic Persian restaurant, this place specializes on the stew type Iranian foods as opposed to the most common kebab type Persian places. Their food is authentically made (and most are healthy!) and I love the cultured atmosphere inside the restaurant. The food is a bit pricey but is definitely worth it as you really cannot have it anywhere else!!  I usually tend to say what the must haves are of each restaurant I go to but I love everything they serve and if you want to know what regular daily authentic Iranian food is like, then definitely try this place out.   Just make sure to have a cup of tea with sweets to seriously relax yourself after an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"To me the food looked better then it tasted.. Out of six people I came with 3 did like their meals and 3 didn't. I ordered chicken with plums and it was waaay too sweet for my taste. The ribs were good according to my friends. Also I feel like this place is a little overpriced. Service was just okay, maybe a little too slow. I'm giving this place an extra star for the decor."}
{"text":"I love Persian stews. My favourite, if I have googled correctly, is Ghormeh Sabzi, which consists of beef, kidney beans, parsley with a hint of lime.  At any rate, I went to Pomegranate and they have a better selection, & probably more hygienic, than my corner grocer.   Pomegranate is a very intimate restaurant where they jealously guard reservations. They have a few table seatings and I highly recommend your group is mindful of the time in order to enjoy your meal.  My group ordered a couple of the yogurt dips, the chicken and lamb stews. I ordered the  qeymeh, which consists of lamb, peas, lime in a tomatoe based stew. It is absolutely delicious. Others ordered the fesenjaan, which consists of a walnut & pomegranate based stew, with chicken; aloo gheysi, which consists of plums and apricots.  My entire table was quietly eating dinner because this is one succulent meal you want to enjoy!"}
{"text":"The selections and daily specials are great and the staff are friendly, even when you mispronounce the menu items.  The braised lamb falls off the bone.  Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite Iranian restaurant. It serves perfect Persian stews and flawless appetizers. I do recommend its Fesenjan for the main dish. Its daily specials are also worthy of try. The Akbar Mashti ice-cream is a Must for dessert if it is your first experience with the Persian cuisine. Its decor and its hommy-tasted food make this  restaurant really unique. My only reason of not giving it full stars is the arrangement of its tables which is so dense and sometimes makes the guests uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Lovely Persian/Iranian restaurant, has a great low key atmosphere and authentic vibes. There are a lot of options and if you're looking for lamb - they make it several ways: just on the bone or in stews. Their rices are also amazing - try the Baqali Polo (dill with Jasmine rice) and their Jewelled Rice with almonds, barberries and orange peels. The Mirza Qasemi (charred egglplant puree) was too heavy on the garlic, but had a very nice roasted taste to it."}
{"text":"Delicious bread - it goes well with dolmeh dipping sauce :P  Lamb shank was excellent with heavenly basmati rice.  Would come back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Persian restaurants in Toronto . Specially if you wanna try the Persian's stew . I loved their khorosh Ghaimeh :)  The atmosphere is really nice. The waitress are nice  and polite. The decoration is kinda remind of Iranian cafe :) You would love the food. There is just no parking around it and u have to park somehow and walk a bit."}
{"text":"When you take your 86 year old aunt out for dinner, there's a lot to consider - parking, ambience, aural sensations, spiciness, patience of waitstaff to name a few. My aunt said she was ok with anything but we know that is senior code for don't make a fuss but know that I am discerning and impatient so Dont Screw It Up Andre! At Pomegranate all worked out with the exception of parking nut hey it's College Street, what do you expect. I dropped her off at the door and returned to find her chatting with our most pleasant, patient and lovely server. They took my coat and hat - thank you, nice touch. She explained the menu carefully, answered our questions, and was very patient. We admired the artwork and wall hangings. The decor is to be experienced. I will not do it disservice by trying to explain it. Go. The food-hot, fresh, delicious. We already were warned by the server what was too spicy. Our food was perfect. And a sizable portion. My aunt Mae was swooning and would certainly tell all the cute little blue hairs back at the seniors home what a mice boy Andre is and how he continues to impress with outstanding restaurant selections. Thanks Pomegranate foraking a wonderful night for us."}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about how beautiful this restaurant is, it's so homey and artsy and awesome! I love how unique their menu is, like nothing I've had before! It's nice to see a Persian place that isn't all kebabs haha beautiful braised lamb and LOVED their appetizer eggplant dip!!!"}
{"text":"MUST TRY:  1. Lamb Shank - There are 3 lamb shank mains on the menu. Make sure you order one of them for some tender lamb treatment. The only difference between them appears to be the rice. It can be confusing to figure this out when reading the menu:  a) adas polo b) morasa polo c) baqali polo  (in order appearance on the menu. They are all great. I think the morasa polo is the most distinct compared to other cuisine because of the orange influence)  2. Aloo gheysi - It's a chicken stew, which is sweeter and lighter in colour than the others. I don't think there is a way to describe this properly. Just order it.  3. Fesenjaan - put walnut and pomegranate in a chicken stew and you're probably headed for greatness  4. Kashk-e bademjaan (appetizer) - it's a wonderful eggplant dip  RECOMMENDED:  Ghormeh Sabzi (special)- More intense and herby than the other stews. Not everyone will love it, but it's great.  GOOD:  Qeymeh - Probably just my personal preference. I love the other stews, so it's like finishing 4th at the Olympics.  Noon-o paneer-o gerdu - solid platter for an intro to the rest of the meal    Strategy:  1. Bring a group and share. Each dish has it's own complexity. When you're sharing 5-6 of these dishes it becomes a whirlwind of flavours. It's like a hurricane. Each individual spice, rice, and lamb molecule interacts with the others to create a profoundly mystifying taste.  2. RESERVATIONS. Must have reservations. Reservations or die.  3. Service: is amicable, but slow and strangely non-existent at times. It may take a while to put your order in and get things rolling, but the food normally comes quite fast. They are laid back, but they seem to truly care if you have a good meal. Stay on top of them if you need to get moving, but it's best to only come here if you're open to a relaxed meal.  BONUS: The decor is smart and gives you the sense that you have been whisked away to Persia.  (sample of 5 meals)"}
{"text":"Went here on a chilly night and warmed up w/ a Persian tea while we perused the menu, finally settling on noon-o paneer-o gerdu, a feta and olive appetizer, to start with,  morasa polo, a braised lamb shank w/ jeweled rice, and the special of the day, lamb stew.  The appetizer is a tasty and refreshing way to get ready for the main course. It's a plate of feta, walnuts, olives, sage, parsley and mint with a side of warm bread. Eaten altogether and the herbs help cleanse your palate.  The morasa polo is a heavy, braised lamb shank complimented with a light basmati rice mixed with dried, sweet and tart fruits. Nicely spiced without being salty, the flavors stand at opposite ends of the spectrum and work well together to keep your mouth interested.  The same can be said of the lamb stew special.  The interior looks warmly lived in.  Portions are good sized so we skipped dessert in favor of a long walk despite the cold."}
{"text":"The dishes here are thought out and spicy!  I can't remember the name of what I ordered last time I was here, but I think it was a chicken stew with plums (?).  Every time I go here I'm surprised by the combinations of foods put together to make something delicious."}
{"text":"I love it here.  This place is different from your typical Persian kabob restaurants; they have super yummy stews and rice dishes. The atmosphere is also very cozy and cute. It's a place I always come back to for enjoying some warm and cozy food with very unique flavours."}
{"text":"Bijan V, thank you for opening my mind to Persian Food. I am a fan.   The flavors bursting out of every dish are incredible. Everything tastes complex, rich, thoughtful, delicious! We ordered several appetizers, entrees, and desserts. This is an obvious pro to group dining, and I couldn't have imagined a better way to experience this food.  Service was on point, too, for such a big group as ours. They were extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  My favorite part of the meal was probably dessert. We ordered Persian tea. It was very good. Bijan even taught us the proper way to drink it -- with a half a sugar cube in your mouth instead of in the cup.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food: had the Kashk-e bademjaan as an appetizer which looked great but tasted like mushy baby food eggplant. However the last bite I added salt and it picked up the taste a bit. For my main I had their lamb stew special with plums and spinach, served with plain rice, tomato and cucumber salad and undressed greens. I thought my tastebuds had died. Nothing had any flavour. Very bland. Even the tomato cucumber salad seemed to have no vinaigrette.   Service: is a bit odd. As other Yelpers commented they tell everyone that comes in the door, how long you have your table. I had a choice between a 60 or 90 minute table. I chose 90 as I wanted to enjoy my meal and not watch the clock. I ordered tea after my meal and they gave me my bill (without my asking) before my tea arrived. And I was only there 50 minutes ( at the 90 min table). The server also took my bread that came with the appetizer half way through the first course. Huh?  Prices were reasonable but if you don't enjoy the meal...."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday and to try their food. Loved the food. Everyone loved the tea and sugar cubes."}
{"text":"New experience with Persian food on my wife's birthday along with our daughter. Small place, nice authentic ambiance, attentive service, new flavors indeed...is it fantastic? not that much, I am not sure how rhubarb fits the Persian meal? portions are SMALL, lamb tastes very good but 3 small pieces in the main course and I like to eat meat, main course for $15.50 mainly..OK to try...the eggplant kashk-e bademjaan dip was good..not cheap for $7.95...reservation is preferred."}
{"text":"So this is what persian food is!  FOOD So a friend and I went to this Pomegranate place because....well ...it apparently had great lamb shank.  And yes...this is correct. The lamb shank was fantastic. The lamb was so big and simply just fell off the bone. My friend had the Morasa Polo since everyone on Yelp chose that one and I had the special of the day (I honestly can't remember what it was).  The Morasa Polo was definitely better than the special of the day. It was much more flavourful than mine.  I felt like mine had no taste whatsoever and that everything tasted the same.  Oh well, I just ate my friend's meal. That's what friends are for right? HA.  RESERVATIONS Based on all the reviews, I made sure we got a reservation. But when we got there on the Friday night, the place was only about half full. But since the restaurant was a relatively small place, it's still a good idea to make reservations. I just didn't feel it was that urgent because it never quite filled up to capacity.  WAIT STAFF The wait staff were very knowledgable and kind. I know other yelpers complained that they took a really long time so I let them know that we had a place to be at a certain time and they were pretty quick on their toes.  Mind you, we didn't order desert.  PARKING We found parking on the street with only a little difficulty. There were some side streets (paid parking) that were untouched and relatively close.  All and all, it was a good meal. Just be careful when you order the special of the day. If it's your first time, I would definitely go with the Morasa Polo."}
{"text":"One of my most memorable Persian jeweled rice meals ever!!!! I ordered the morasa polo bc I love lamb but really all the the dishes tasted amazing. We were a party of 6 so each of us ordered different entrees. Also tried a bunch of apps. Everything was amazing. Not a place for grilled BBQ'd meats as that is the place next door but definitely the best rice dishes! I've had better Persian meats in California than their restaurant next door but definitely sample their jeweled rice dishes here!"}
{"text":"I dined here with a family member recently, and overall, the experience was pleasant. We had  reservations close to when the kitchen was closing, so we expected a quick meal. The servers were pleasant and attentive during the experience. We ordered the special of the night which was the gourmet sabzi and the aloo gheysi. Each came with a salad which consisted of arugula and mixed lettuces in a very tangy vinaigrette that my dining partner and I didn't particularly enjoy. As I didn't wish to have the rice, they provided an extra serving of this salad for my dish, although I didn't finish it.   My dish consisted of a a stew with fenugreek, kidney beans, a lime, and boneless lamb pieces in an herbacious stew. It was a bit bitter at first, but I requested additional spices on the side to make it more flavourful. Overall, it was satisfying, but not a dish that I would order again.  My dinner date ordered the aloo ghyesi, and although the chicken, rice and salad were quite good, my friend did not really appreciate the sweetness from the apricots. After trying the dish myself, I would have to agree. It seems like they simply dropped dried apricots into a chicken dish, and although there were supposed to be plums, we could not locate them.  Overall, the experience was 'okay'. I recall it being better several years ago when I first went there. It did end up being quite busy for a Wednesday night, and I'm sure that this institution has built its reputation on providing its customers with quality Persian/Iranian food.   My dining companion described it as 'different' and 'interesting', which I am in agreement with."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night and made reservations earlier in the day. This is a small restaurant that fills up fast so I would definitely make reservations before coming here.  The restaurant is cozy and the servers are very friendly. The price range is moderate, with entrees running from $12 - $18. You can see the full menu on their website: http://www.pomegranaterestaurant.ca/pomegranate/menu.html  The Food:  Main Course Me: morasa polo - LOVED IT I really enjoyed my morasa polo, which is braised lamb shank and saffron rice that has slivers of seville orange peel, almond and pistachio with diced carrots and barberries. The lamb was tender and fell off the bone. The rice was delicious - premium basmati rice that was both salty and sweet with the addition of the orange peel and nuts. Yum!!  Bf: fesenjaan with lamb  - LOVED IT He actually tried to order the qeymeh at first but they were out of it. Not sure how often this happens - this was fairly early on a Saturday night (7pm) so we were a bit surprised that they were out already. But the waiter then recommended fesenjaan as one of their specialties and my boyfriend really enjoyed it. The dish normally comes with chicken breast, but my boyfriend had his heart set on lamb and asked if the dish could be served with that instead. The waiter checked and was able to accommodate us - yay! That definitely scored service points in our books. The waiter actually told us that fesenjaan used to be served with lamb before, but they no longer offer that on the menu, but if you ask for it, you can still get it, so good to know! The walnut pomegranate paste was really different. I thought it was alright, but my boyfriend really liked it. So much that he mentioned it again at dinner tonight (at Pomegranate's little sister restaurant next door) how much he liked it. That doesn't happen often!  Dessert - Ice cream and Mint tea - LOVED IT The ice cream is homemade honey rosewater ice cream and it was really good. The flavours are very subtle and not too sweet, which my boyfriend really liked. The mint tea was simply fresh mint leaves steeped in water, but it was enough to give off a minty taste.  Overall, we really like this restaurant, for the friendly, accommodating service, generous portion size, moderate price and awesome food!   Lastly, I must tell you the highlight of the evening - I spotted Rachel McAdams dining there!! You can add celebrity hotspot as part of its positives.  I rarely give 5 stars, but Pomegranate restaurant deserves it heartily. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cozy, intimate restaurant with great lamb dishes and yogurt dips."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Persian food before... don't.  The taste is not like any other cuisine I've ever ate. Very sweet and acidic. I went here with my girlfriend. Both of us hadn't ate all day... we were starving. Long story short we left after eating maybe 10% of our food. I got the lamb stew special, she got the chicken fesanjoon.  Never coming back.. should have listened to our Persian friend that told us we wouldnt like the food lol.  To be fair it could just be because our pallettes aren't familiar with the flavours at all but we were hoping for more flavour and spice. The food may be good for someone who likes the Iranian flavours but it just wasn't for us. This is the first time we have found a cuisine that I didn't really like. We frequently eat indian, Chinese, Thai, and Ethiopian just to give you an idea of what we like and what we are used to."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Toronto!  Intimate setting, great price-point for authentic and delicious Persian food!  They have a cardamon-rose ice cream on the menu that is simply divine, and they do magical things with eggplant.  Much appreciated by a vegetarian! Staff are contentious and relaxed.  If you haven't tried this place out yet, it's a must! :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night and it was delicious!  The service was great and the decor was very cute. Between 3 girls we had 3 apps, 2 mains, a bottle of wine and a dessert and it was the perfect amount.  If you have a big appetite you can definitely finish a main on your own.  The price for all that was amazing!  The bill for each of us came to $30 not including tip (and they deserved a good tip). The food is fresh and delicious and the servers explain the ingredients and regions the food comes from if you ask. I will definitely return here and would recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Note: the restaurant opens at 5pm, check the time before going there.  This is a sister restaurant to Sherzade (it is next door). It is more vegetarian/vegan friendly, but at the same time almost every meal has an option to add a meat.    Ambiance (3.5 stars): From the first look this place looks like you walked through a portal to Iran, from the wall colors and calligraphy, to the multiple ornaments (shisha, different vases...). The restaurant is self descried as cozy, and that explains it very well.  It seats just around 30-40 people, with everyone being in close proximity.  The washrooms are in the back, clean, but a bit warn down.  Service: (3.5 stars) The server told us the specials and was able to explain the difference between all the meals and gave us suggestions on what to get.  She was the only one working for part of the shift, so the service was naturally a bit slow.  Food: (4.5 stars) The food is delicious, I got adas polo with braised lamb shank. (see picture) The meat was falling of the bone, and the rice was delicious.  I originally was a bit skeptical that it would be too sweet, but it turned out to be perfectly balanced.  Most of the people I was with were happy with the food, but were a it disappointed with the small portions.  Most of the portions were in the $14-16 range.  I would suggest getting an appetizer or desert as well to be really full.   For the full worth, I would suggest going next door to Sheherezade."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is compact. It was packed on a Sunday night. The decor is absolutely stunning. For a tiny restaurant, it's clear that it has been decorated with much attention to detail. The service is pretty fantastic.   Being vegetarian kind of screws me over when trying many cuisines since meat is such a big part of them. Thus far, the only cuisines I've found extremely vegetarian friendly are Indian, Thai, and Mexican. Anyhow, we ordered the Spinach Borani, which was fresh yogurt with spinach in it. It was basically Spinach Dip but much less thicker, and a lot fresher.   I ordered the Adas Polo, and my date ordered the Mirza qasemi. For the first time, I could empathize with what non-Indians must go through upon reading the menu for the first time in an Indian restaurant :)   The Adas Polo was good, but could use more flavour. It was really quite dry. The Adas Polo is, as per the menu, \"lentils, dates and sultana raisins blended into a saffron basmati rice topped with crispy onion with barberries.\"   The Mirza qasemi had the same problem- lacking flavour.   While we both enjoyed our meals, I doubt I will return but that's only because Middle Eastern cuisine just doesn't have much to offer for me as a pescetarian, and not because this restaurant doesn't do it well.  Moreover, my natural inclination is to compare it to Indian food, and it seems rather bland when I do so. This was my first introduction to Middle Eastern cuisine, and it was rather interesting. 1I'm glad I tried out this restaurant."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. It's all Persian and colourful. Service is a little slow but the food more than makes up for it. The lamb is out of this world with the jewels rice and there is a dish with chicken in a walnut and pomegranate sauce that is so wonderful! You need to get it for sure!"}
{"text":"It was absolutely packed when we were here, and that was on a weeknight.   The fesenjaan is good enough to command that kind of crowd.  It was really, really good. It comes with a nice side salad, famous Persian rice, and yogurt. I'd order it again 1000 times over.  The Persian tea was also quite good.  The bademjan appetizer, however, was charred to the point of tasting burnt. I don't know if it was a fluke, but it was not right.   The service was prompt, but verged on condescending at points. Still, the fesenjaan makes this place worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The spinach Borani was so yummy. But Dolmeh was little bit dry I thought.Great service."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday. Ordered two aps for me and my two friends and the waitress brought a small basket of maybe 5 pieces of flatbread. We obviously finished it super quick and asked for more bread. They gave us more which had maybe 4 pieces of skinny pieces of bread. We had asked for one more and the waitress told the owner and the owner looked so angry and said they keep asking for bread!! Charge them for It!! We were right there too...heard it all. The owner seems to be a bit stingy. Anyway the entree were okay. The meals have an acquired taste. Wouldn't come back here again. We were still hungry after."}
{"text":"Ok so i have mixed feelings about this place.  I was excited to finally have tried the place, but overall, i liked the food, but maybe it was too hyped up for me.   I found the food flavourfull, good, but not mind blowing. I've been to Iran before and found the food close to authentic, but at same time, you could still taste Canada if that makes any sense.  That being said, it does good for an Iranian restaurant here....but to be honest with you, there are quite a few similar joints in the north end with the same flavour profile. My iranian friend that came with me to dinner shared the same view as i did.  All in all, great Irani food, especially for downtown, but don't expect this place to be a regular spot that blows your mind. I'll go back for sure, but i won't be making the recommendation to go there."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! The food is amazing, the ambiance is cozy and the service is excellent!   Definitely would go there every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Best Fesenjoon you can get at a restaurant in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD, you can't even get anything close to it in Tehran (Fesenjoon's birthplace). Let me explain the dish first: it is chicken breast/thighs pieces, soaked in pomegranate sauce, with tiny pieces of walnut. It comes with rice, BUT keep in mind that when you're having Persian food, rice is not a side dish. NO NO! It is as important as the Fesenjoon itself, so don't mix it with salad and all the other good stuff you find on the table, it's offensive. I'm joking, but only the offensive part was a joke. If you go here and don't want to order this heavenly dish (maybe cause you're one those people who don't order the most famous dish of the restaurant they go to - no judgment!), other dishes are very delicious too. I also love the appetizers, they come with hot barbari (Persian bread).  Important thing to note: make a reservation for the weekends at least a week in advance. This place is my heaven."}
{"text":"Hands down, Pomegranate is the best Persian food, this side of Tehran!  Don't miss out on the Fasanjoun!"}
{"text":"I'd heard so many great things about Pomegranate that we I thought we were wise to arrive extra early for dinner one evening. While the restaurant was essentially empty when we entered, the friendly server very nicely asked whether we had made reservations and assured us that despite our not having done so, that we could have the table for an hour and a half.   Despite there being two daily specials (both featuring lamb) and a good assortment of dishes on the menu, we both ended up ordering the same thing: mushrooms in a rich ground walnut and pomegranate sauce served with fragrant rice, a refreshing cucumber salad, and mixed greens. I also opted for a side of decadently thick yogourt, which arrived as a heaping cupful, so one order could likely satisfactorily be shared between two.  Over the course of our meal, the warm and richly tapestried room filled up quickly with families, couples on dates, and small groups of friends. All of the happy chatter made for a lovely atmosphere to dine in. While we had been looking so very much forward to sharing the dessert of Persian rose ice cream with pistachios, we were both far too full by the end of the meal, but instead made note of it for next time."}
{"text":"Cozy spot for stewed Persian dishes! Came by on a weekday with a reservation for two at 6:30pm and was easily seated but the place filled up really quickly by 7. We shared the Spinach Borani ($4.50) which was a good companion to the complimentary bread. We liked the dip so much that we got extra bread to really clean off the dish. I had the Mirza Qasemi ($11) - eggplant in a garlicky tomato stew with salad - and I upgraded the rice to Baqali Polo (fava beans and dill) which was a nice, filling addition. Overall the dish was comfy, flavourful and light!  The service was friendly but it was pretty hard to get the attention of the staff since two of them had to watch over the whole restaurant. Would love to come back and try more though!"}
{"text":"The food here was one of the best Iranian foods that I've ever had. I loved this place. I loved everything about this place. Everybody's very nice and helpful here.  We've got zeytoon parvardeh for the appetizer. It comes in a different form than I usually used to get it. It looked like it's grounded. It was different, but it tasted awesome. The food presentation was perfect, the color, the smell the taste. everything was perfect. The rice was cooked to perfection and it was properly portioned. the food came with greens salad and shirazi salad. all the greens were super fresh and the dressing was just perfect. Lemon juice in shirazi salad tasted like freshly squeezed lemons. We had fesenjan and baghali polo, and both of them was perfect. the lamb shank was prefectly cooked and seasoned. I'm not baghali polo fan, however, It was delicious, and it was one of the bests that I've ever had. They say, you have to try real taste of Iranian cuisine in people's house; I'm telling you, their food tastes better than many homemade foods that I've ever had."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience. We went there at a Saturday night, I understand if the restaurant is packed the service will be a bit slow, but at this restaurant I didn't get any service at all. Only the owner take order, so we waited for a long time for her to take our order, the place was crowded but there are only two other waitresses, so we seldom get any water, even if we asked for it we have to wait a long time. Most of the time we can't even see the waitresses, we had to walk up front to ask for things. I wanted to order the ice cream but the owner was so busy taking everyone else's order so we decided to just pay and leave this place. Not surprisingly we waited more than 10 minutes for the bill but it still didn't come, again we have to walk up front and pay.   The food is above average but it's not amazing. I suggest the owner if you know your restaurant if popular please hire more people to help."}
{"text":"Food was interesting, considering I have never tried this type of food. The decor was very interesting, service was great. The jury is out as to if we liked the food or not. Give it a try."}
{"text":"My 300th reviews for my 2nd UYE event!  Thanks Bijan V for organizing this UYE. If not I would have never ever cross my mind to try out Persian food or even coming to Pomegranate Restaurant. And of course fellow yelpers that makes the evening enjoyable!  The Pomegranate Restaurant itself is small and cosy. I have to say the decoration is really exotic. I really like all those rich colours they used in everything. The blue ceiling, the colourful tables, the textiles used, the plates that decorated the walls! (good for interesting, colourful photos!!)  It was really nice to have enough people so we can share the dishes! As I always have lunch alone and ended up it will take me a couple of times before I can tried out all the different dishes in a restaurant, but with all these dinnermates, I got to have a taste of everything!  Since I was not the one that ordering I don't really know which is which item in the menu.   For starter, there are 3 spreads with the bread. I really love the bread. It is freshly baked! I am eating the spreads because of the bread!   There is also this greeny moldy looking yogurt drink that has mint and rose petal water. It is salty tasting with an acquired taste. Some complains it tasted like toothpaste. However, I find it goes really well with the lamb dishes, it naturalized the \"lamb\" taste and the other strong herbal tastes in the meat dishes.  For 4 main entrees we shared, 2 of them are stews (chicken and lamb) and 2 of them are lamb shanks. They all comes with salad and rice. I do enjoy the taste of the stews, the favour is really complex... with all those spices and herbs. The lamb shanks though are really tender and juicy and cook to perfection.  Even as a non lamb eater, to my surprise even I enjoyed the lamb dishes!  For desserts, we have the persian tea... which go well with the super sweet desserts!   The services is nice and friendly. Though we cannot stay longer to relax because our table is needed for another group of later dinners.  The day bed at the back of the restaurant seems like a really relaxing neat place to have some finger food and a drink or 2 with friends!  I have to say that the Persian spices and herbs does need to be get used to! I was burping the whole night! :) or was it from the cabornated green drink that I drank almost half a pitcher?  BURP! BURP! BURP!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested to eat at a Persian restaurant which I was iffy at first since I've never had this type of cuisine before. She said she went here many times and so I trusted her that it would be good.   Entering the place early for dinner, the place was deserted and I was able to admire the interesting decor on the wall and the small pond at the entrance with goldfish. Less than an hour in there, the place was already packed for 6 pm dinner. Indeed, I was surprised!!   Happy:  The waitress was friendly and attentive. The menu is not large, so it was easy to pick a dish that I would like to try. The appetizers were decent in price and cheaper than I imagined for a restaurant. I ordered Mirza Qasemi which is: \"charred eggplant puree in a mildly spicy garlic tomato sauce served with saffron basmati rice.\" The eggplant was placed in a small bowl and it was hot in temperature. I like the tomato taste that went with it. Even the rice was hot since I know the sides tend to be prepared earlier on. The 2 salads were nice, a mixed green and a shirazi (which is tomato, cucumber and onion chopped up with a vinaigrette sauce). I was definitely really full at the end as I devoured everything, except I left some rice behind. The eggplant had the right kick of spice and I liked how it was still hot while I was eating it.   My friends got a chicken and lamb dish that looked similar to mind. They both liked the dish. It felt like a combination of Persian and Caucasian food (the salad).   Not happy:  We weren't able to get split bills so we had to calculate our own bills. Besides the eggplant dish, a different side would be nice to try instead of 2 salads that I know of. Perhaps another traditional Persian dish would be nice.   The vanilla ice cream with infused rose water is quite interesting. At first, it feels like you are eating cold perfume which is weird. I had to get used to it, but at the end, enough was enough. I liked the toppings of chopped up almonds and pomegranate seeds.   Verdict:  It was certainly an experience and I was glad that I went there with friends. I don't think I would have gone there if she didn't suggested it. I wouldn't mind going back again and trying out their other dishes, especially their appetizers."}
{"text":"Overall, probably my favourite restaurant in Toronto.  I'm a sucker for the lamb dishes - qeymeh is one of my usual go-tos from the regular menu.   If qormeh sabzi is one of the specials of the day, ORDER IT (if you like lamb)! This is my favourite dish ever.  I haven't had a bad meal here, or a bad experience. The staff are always friendly, the prices are incredibly reasonable. The only thing I can suggest is to make a reservation, to avoid disappointment. The dining room isn't huge, and it's a popular place."}
{"text":"I liked the ambience, I had the lamb stew, as recommended by many. The side salad that comes with it was pretty unappetizing. The food was good, not outstanding."}
{"text":"If you're looking for non grilled traditional Persian food, this should be your go to spot. Hell they even have the wooden bed in the back that you can done on if you're looking for a serious old school experience. I can't pick one favorite on the menu. Eat it all. Take your friends, eat their food too. Make reservations they're always packed."}
{"text":"I liked the interior, the Persian paintings and accents made the space inviting and set a great atmosphere for the meal.  The food was good, but not spectacular.  I know that Persian food is generally not as spicy but the flavours while good didn't pop.  We each ordered different dishes and tried a number of options.  All were solid but none particularly amazing.  I did enjoy the appetizer of cheese, olives, walnuts and fresh bread.  It was my favorite part of the meal.  Overall, it was a solid experience."}
{"text":"Wow!  One of the best Iranian Restaurants in North America!  Excellent food, friendly service and reasonably priced.  For sure, I will go back next time I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about it ! The food is great, the decor is simply AMAZING , and the price is right. The waitresses were really nice and for me, that's very important.  We went there last Saturday around 6 and I was happy we had reservations because it was already half full.  Even if you're not a big fan of Persian food, you should give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. It is great ot know that my vegatarian partner and my carnivorous self can be saited. The service was fantasti, staff were attentive and great with their recommendation. The food was a standout. Coming from Australia, we never had Persian Food before and we were really happy that we had the opportunity to each here"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here several times. The first time we went we loved the food, and were I writing based on that experience, I would give 4 stars.  We found the owner a little quirky, but that added to the charm of the place.   Sadly, each subsequent visit the quality and enjoyment has diminished. The last time we went we were rudely told we could only have our table for 30 minutes because they needed it for reservations. The place was empty except for two other tables, but what the heck, we thought we'd get quick service anyways. I wish we had gone elsewhere because whatever the chef did to the lamb I ate gave me the worst stomach I've had in years.  The one nice bit of food is the warm pita bread, however, you don't get a lot in your order.  Fortunately the portions are small, so you're not subjected to too much of the greasy, over-spiced meat. Well, it said lamb on the menu... Needless to say, I've been steering my wife away from making plans to return to the Pomegranate."}
{"text":"Love love love! Decor is so nice it's like a whimsical museum up in here and I'm taking ideas to decorate my own home. The food is sooo good I never had Iranian food before such a great introduction. My fave dish was the charred eggplant dish and I'm not even vegetarian. That's how good it is. The other eggplant dip is also very good. The chicken stew with apricots was such an interesting combo but worked well. MUST GET THE ICE CREAM and I'm not even an ice cream person. I love rosewater and that's what it's made with and it tastes so refreshing and amazing. All in all must visit for sure."}
{"text":"Great d√©cor and ambiance. I loved the rice and lamb was really tender. Service was good, however, I've had better middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"I'd imagine eating a meal at Pomegranate to be like eating a meal at my parents home (if I were Iranian). The whole experience was solid from start to finish and I highly recommend everyone to come eat here and take other people here as well!  To start the experience off right, make sure you make a reservation. Don't let that get in the way of the meal.   The place is a cozy place and as you walk in, you'll notice that its packed already. The food though - is unreal. Make sure for starters, to get the kashk-e bademjaan. It's a great dish to share. We went as a group of four and ordered one appetizier to share and four entrees which was more than enough. Each entree comes in either a stew or a meat, with a side salad, a Persian-style salsa, and a side of rice. If possible, ask for their dill rice (green rice). Not sure if it's a regular since we had it as their special, but that's how rice should be cooked. Always.  For entrees, we had the qeymeh, the fesenjaan, the lamb shank, and something else.. I'd go for the fesenjaan everytime. It's heavy though so make sure you come hungry.  Not sure why there are so many mixed reviews about this place but I'll stand by it.   Tagline: Great Persian home cooked food for the masses, what else do you need to know?"}
