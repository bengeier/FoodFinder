{"text":"Pizza is OK however customer service is grossly lacking and leaves something to be desired. Not impressed at all!  Another downside is the pricing.  They seemed to have increased their prices as of late which means that a small pizza with ample toppings will easily run you 20.00!

Also, if you don't wish to wait 1.5 to 2 hours for your pizza delivery, I would highly recommend you order ahead and pick it up versus having it delivered.  The delivery time quoted to me when ordering my pizza on 2 occasions was 45 minutes, each time it took 1.5 - 2 hours and when I called all I got in response was, \"driver left a while ago so he should be there shortly\"!  Go figure."}
{"text":"I like the food that I have had at this place but I am completely disappointed in the service I received.  I work at a local business that is about 10 minutes from this restaurant.  The first time I ordered delivery it was 15 minutes later than the 45 minute delivery time that they promise, we ordered for several people in our office and there were several complaints about the wait and the food including one order that was completely wrong, and they had to bring it back and that they watered down their ranch.  There was a definite different in the ranch  dress we got on the returned 2nd order.   Today I choose to give them a 2nd chance and place my order at 11:00 am and asked for a 12 noon delivery time.  I also called to verify that they had received my order and wanted to make sure that this time all instructions were send over from Beyond Menu, the service that they choose to provide this information for.  At 12:15 I called to just get an estimate of delivery  I was told at this time that the driver had left about 6 minutes ago and should be at my office within the next 6 minutes.  After 6 phone calls, 2 phone calls from Beyond Menu and an 2 and a half hours after I placed my order, my food was dropped off to the front desk.  The restaurant told me that he had given my number to the driver and I had been waiting on a call, they never called me on my cell, but told Beyond menu that the driver had called me 3 times.  The security guard did call my desk but I was in the lunch room waiting on a call from the driver.  I had been waiting in the lobby but got tired of waiting.  The manager/owner did not seem the least bit concerned and give me several different stories including telling me to cancel my order because they were busy. The bag was torn open and they discount they offered me was just left at the front desk.  I  would not recommend them for delivery in anyway shape or form.  The wings are some of the best I had but if the service  and concern for the customer is at this level I will pass."}
{"text":"The only time I have good Sicilian pizza is when I travel back home to northeastern PA. I figured I'd try their \"Sicilian style\" pizza. Not Sicilian style at all. Not terrible, but also not Sicilian. Regular pizza was good though."}
{"text":"Have ordered twice -- the same thing: lamb gyro. It comes with outrageous fries, so be warned, you will have to hide them from yourself. The first time I ordered it there was only three thin pieces of meat, a real disappointment. The second time I ordered I added in the comments section (I ordered online) no onions, extra meat. I was willing to pay extra. Well, they did add extra meat and it was PERFECT! It arrived hot and quickly. The ability to order and pay online is a big plus because I annoy easily ...and waiting on hold, repeating things on the phone, keeping my fingers crossed they got it right is completely avoided. Lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, pita bread tasted home made-delicious and dipping sauce was good. For an Italian Restaurant they nailed this savory Greek dish!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Pizza and wings. The Pizza was cold and taistless. I requested red pepper flakes and didn't get them. The wings were just ok but the blue cheese dressing was also taistless.
Won't order from them again."}
{"text":"Finally found a place with good pizza and wings that delivers! The pizza is much better than any of the major chain restaurants and priced well. I was so happy they delivered to my area!! They got here in under 40 mins which was also a plus. I have lived in the area 3 years and always passed this place and never noticed it but I am so glad I found them on yelp!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst restaurant ever. I ordered take out.  The potato skins were burnt. They gave me no blue cheese or hot sauce with the tenders as I ordered.  It took over a hour to get it the first time.  I called back and was told it would take another hour.  Cold tenders an hour later. The blue cheese was sour with a film over it. Disgusting.   Would never eat there again"}
{"text":"The best Pizza and Steak rolls ever!! The delivered in the snow!!! I just found a new pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!! This is now my 2nd time eating here over the past 3 weeks. The first time I got their small pizza & 6 wings special, which was just enough to feed two. I was surprised at how good the pizza was! The wings were average and so was the ranch, but the pizza won me over.  We both had some slight stomach \"issues\" the next day though, but it didn't stop me from wanting to give them another go. I chalked that up to getting old! Teeheeheehee :-)

So this time I ordered the 4 Star Stromboli (add onions of course) and it was Fantastic!! It was HUGE, could only eat less than half. The buttery garlic taste was profoundly scrumptious! I added a side of marinara to dip a lil :-)  Anywhatever, I only wished they'd evenly distribute the meat across the entire stromboli. I want to take bites of each meat included Everytime! 

Milano's may now be my family's go to spot. I also ordered there & waited...delivery can be sketchy at any fast food joint! I'll pass! Go get U some!"}
{"text":"Seafood Pizza: It is not legal to list \"crabmeat\" as an ingredient if the actual ingredient is imitation crab (imitation crab is made with a type of fish) my friend is allergic to fish."}
{"text":"Tried their pizza and some wings tonight. I was a little skeptical about it as there was no one there at all @ 6pm and their grade was in the low 90s. I told the cashier it was our first time in and thought maybe she would offer a suggestion but no. The pizza was just Ok, nothing special.  The wings were good. I felt like the $2.50 upcharge was ridiculous for requesting all flats and $1.00 for one extra blue cheese. Bottom line it is, it wasn't bad but I think I'd rather just order delivery from papa john's."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them on several occasions and their customer service is always spot on!  Deliveries have always been on time and most importantly the food arrives hot.  This is some of the best pizza in town and is always my go to.  I recently dinned in the restaurant for the first time and just like the delivery, everything was fantastic.  Customer service is polite and enjoyable and they make you feel right at home.  They took great care of us and, as always, the pizza was great!  

I'd recommend mushrooms & jalapeños or pepperoni & banana peppers and a slice of cheesecake to finish it off."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pizza!! It is a little more expensive than some of the other local places, but well worth the extra couple of dollars.

Their chocolate cake, (which is textured more like a cheesecake) is fantastic!!! 
The tiramisu is great too. The slices are smaller than they were a couple years ago. I still love them though. Certainly not enough to share, but do you really want to share your cake with someone else???"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and it was delivered within an hour (estimated time was 45 to 60 min) which is what we were expecting for an order of a fresh made Greek pizza with gyro meat (guys, gyro meat... On a pizza), turkey grinder, and calzone. 

This food was definitely worth the wait! We were so happy with everything and the crust on the pizza and calzone was FANTASTIC! I don't really like turkey that much but even the grinder was delicious. We couldn't believe we didn't try this place earlier and will definitely be ordering Milano's again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lamb Gyro and some Chicken Wings. I thought they were both Pretty Good. I will order from them again soon, but I think I will try the Pizza next time."}
{"text":"Going to Recommend this place to everyone I know! We had take out. We walked in and ordered no problems and got the food in a timely manner. I ordered the Meatball Sub which was so good the Cheese was plentiful and the Meatballs were cooked perfectly. We also got the Pizza Fries we didn't know what they were but ordered anyway. They are amazing they give you so much food! My girlfriend who is a huge food snob especially when it comes to Chicken Parm Sandwiches. These must be amazing because she ate the whole 8 inch sandwich first time I have ever seen her finish a Chicken Parm Sandwich!

Everyone has to Try this place out!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the hotel.  Probably the worst food and service we have had for pizza in years.  Ordered the #1 special with large cheese pizza, wings, and garlic bread. Also a large house salad.

Took 1 hour to deliver.

Pizza was rubber and cold

Wings were supposed to be BBQ but we're dry, over cooked, and tasted like ketchup. Ordered ranch - got blue cheese

Garlic bread was cold.

Salad - ordered large but was the equivalent of a small anywhere else.  Asked for balsamic got nothing!

Called to tell them the order was not complete and the response was basically \"So what.\"  Finally the manager agreed to send over the correct dressing. 45 minutes later nothing.  Finally at 10:00pm I called them back to tell the driver not to bother because we were DONE!

Don't, just don't."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in Charlotte. The prices are reasonable and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Reminds me of the type of pizza I would get back in Michigan. Different from domino's and other chains. Lots of menu options too. Friendly over the phone and decent delivery time."}
{"text":"Food is decent. I've had the grinders, pizza, and wings. Their prices are ridiculous for some things, and reasonable for others. For instance, they charge you .75 for a mayo on a sandwich. WHAT??? Their side salad is 4 bucks, and its basically just iceberg lettuce. That's fine, once you know what you like, you will be fine paying the prices. Its the customer service that sucks. I put in an order for my coworkers, and they wouldn't split the bill. If it had been my food I would've cancelled my order. Even when I asked if they could just take two separate payments, they refused. I've never heard of that. Ever. The way they were talking to me was enough that I won't go back, and I'm the food runner at my job. They lost this company's business for sure."}
{"text":"Good pizza for the south. Thin crust and good cheese. Quick delivery to our hotel. Decent price. Will order again."}
{"text":"The pizza dough wasn't cooked all the way through, and the pizza just didn't taste good at all. I ordered a chocolate cake and it was frozen. Employees are nice but wouldn't order from here again!"}
{"text":"Got the eggplant grinder. Taste great. Very hot. Would have gotten fries but the the cost was 3 bucks more so just got the grinder. The grinder is worth the 6 or 7 bucks."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. Takes me back to Marks Pizza in New York. Prices are on par with other non chain pizza place. If you're looking for a northern tasting pizza definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"We had pizza and wings and both were AMAZING. I haven't been able to find good pizza since moving to Charlotte and I'm so happy I found this place!! Definitely will eat here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I've had since I've been in Charlotte.  Every Tuesday is pizza day at our house. We usually pick it up from different corporate franchised pizza places. My husband won a free pizza from here a couple of weeks ago and decided to try it on the next pizza day.  It was the most delicious pizza I can remember having in ages!  Well, tonight's pizza night, and this is where we'll be getting it from now on!"}
{"text":"I am new to town and I decided to order from Milano's Pizza and Pasta so that I wouldn't have to go out. I ordered a 6inch pepperoni and ham pizza along with a lamb gyro and a slice of cheesecake. The order came pretty quickly and everything looked good. I tried the pizza and it had a weird aftertaste, when I looked at it I realized this was because the  bottom layer of the crust was still pretty doughy. The other half of the pizza was even more doughy. The gyro was pretty good but it was supposed to come with a cup of cucumber sauce and I did not receive that in the bag. I also asked for plasticware since I had nothing to eat with since I just moved in and that was not in the bag either. All in all I was pretty disappointed and will not order from here again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have an Italian resturant in the area.  I absolutely love it.  I tried this place out and wasn't expressed with the food.  Now I have only had the delivery so that might be why I wasn't thrilled with my dishes.  I will be visiting this place again to try it out fresh."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST pizza in Charlotte!! Every time we order, it's consistently delicious! Definitely a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible pizza was soggy.. Meat tastes process. When we took our pizza back to get a refund & they still charge us a delivery fee of $2 plus decided  to keep our $3 tip 
So we lost $5 SO BEWEAR if you want a Quality pizza 
Stay far away from this place. SMH!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for delivery of which I have had twice. I want to love this place as there are occasions in which you really want bar food but don't want to go out. However I can't love this place because the food is only okay (usually arrives cold). Delivery is decent, although we did have an issue last weekend. Part of our order was forgotten and when I called they said they would send the driver back out. We waited over an hour and he still hadn't come back. I called again and asked for them to just credit my card back the amt for the missing order. If I had written this review yesterday I would have said they never did, but I checked this morning and I do have a credit. So I will continue to randomly give these guys a shot because the food isn't terrible and even if they screw up they will make it right. Hopefully in the future I can increase this rating!"}
{"text":"Honestly, we have ordered from this restaurant for delivery at least 12 times now. The calzones are amazing, they've even improved over the last year (love the seafood one). You definitely won't be disappointed ordering the pizza or calzones. The alfredo is very rich, save up your calories for that dish, tasty, but rich!

Delivery is a big plus, never late, always courteous. We will continue to order from here! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed with the food and service at this location. Unable to drive thanks to a severely sprained ankle I ordered in for delivery. The ordering system is fine except there's not enough detail. I chose hot peppers assuming they were banana peppers which really aren't that hot but figured since they are so popular that's what it meant. I waited over an hour for delivery only to discover they were jalapenos, and the Pepsi I ordered came as diet. I was able to catch the guy and let him know I needed a regular Pepsi which he said he would return with right away. Keeping in mind I live less than minutes from this location, I mean it is probably exactly 1 mile. It took another hour and a half to get my beverage. I had to call and check on it twice and the girl just kept apologizing and saying 10 more minutes, no compensation was ever offered. After waiting 2 1/2 hours for a medium pizza and warm 20 oz Pepsi, I will absolutely never order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"After my recent debacle with trying to order via Yelp24, I decided to give Milanos another try. So I just call them and place my orders. My family really enjoys their pizzas, typically the last few weeks we've been ordering once a week. The one thing that I don't like is the way the pizza is cut. While they do have a pretty large menu, I've also tried their chicken Alfredo, which l would recommend as well. I and happy to have a local establishment that delivers in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Finally, a local pizza place that also delivers! Great pizza, wings, chicken alfredo, and the garlic bread is really good. The staff is really nice and they have specials all the time. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing. We were so surprised how good it was. We ordered in one night at the hotel boy I'm glad we did. My wife got a salad and that was also good."}
{"text":"No only was the food AMAZING but the service was amazing they treated us like family and I love that I didn't have to wait long for my food. Officially my new pasta spot!"}
{"text":"My partner and I work a lot of hours and sometimes we put in our most hours from home. We recently relocated to Fort Mill and decided to try Milano's for lunch delivery. The food was fantastic. Don't let t he minimum delivery charge ($35) fool you. We ordered two huge salads (the grilled chicken and the antipasto) and wings which we had with the leftover salad for dinner. So for $35 ($35.60 to be exact because we ordered an extra dressing) we had two fantastic meals and we didn't need to leave our home. Our food was delivered within the expected time frame, and the delivery guy was super friendly.

If you live in the Fort Mill area, work a lot, happen to work form home from time to time and don't have the time or supplies in the fridge to make your own lunch/dinner, Milano's is great."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour and 25 minutes for my delivery. The pizza was cold when it arrived! Very dissatisfied and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"They get 2 stars because the pizza is not too bad. Otherwise, awful customer service, delivery order was wrong 3 times in a row, at which point I gave up. Took 1.5 hours to get to me the last time, and an hour or more previously. The person I spoke to each time could not have cared less. Save your time and money and go to Luigis."}
{"text":"GREAT pizza and Wings!  Also, super nice on the phone when ordering delivery.  So, why only 3 stars?  ...cold pizza.    Hand down better wings and pizza than any of the national chains (even cold) but for only being 5 minutes from the store I would have expected warmer.   

I'll give this locally owned shop another chance in the future but I'll probably go pick it up or dine in."}
{"text":"Have ordered from Milano's many times! Love their pizza! Everything is delivered hot and fresh. Love the fact that they use fresh mushrooms on the pizza, not canned like too many pizza places! Tried the hot wings, decent heat, nicely fried!

My husband I and I love their delivery service. Fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here- ordered delivery- it took about an hour an 20 minutes to get to me and the pizza was cold.  The pepperoni roll was really good though!  Would definitely recommend that but order it to pick up.  I called after waiting for an hour and they assured me it was on the way and were very nice.  Maybe it was an off night or I ordered too late.  I ordered at 9:45 and they close at 10:30. Probably won't order from there again though."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are only 3 stars and bad reviews...this place was amazing! It was the second time I have had it and both times were awesome. 
I ordered the chicken Alfredo and it was perfect. Plenty of Alfredo sauce and enough for 2-3 people! 
We also ordered the Philly grinder and seafood grinder.  The seafood grinder was AWESOME! Big pieces are crab meat and lots of shrimp! 
Delivery to my area was approx 1 hour but well worth the wait! It was fresh and hot when they got here. Fries were not even soggy."}
{"text":"While the quality is pretty decent, there are other issues that after tonight's delivery made me finally throw in the towel and say \"never again.\"  

Let me preface by saying that I live 2 minutes away, and I have NEVER had any order delivered in under 60 minutes.  Not once.  I placed my order at 6:59 tonight, and received at 8:20.  The driver d*mn near threw the box at me and RAN, and the second I opened the box I understood why.  Not only was it completely screwed up after being slammed around, it has been like that for quite some time, as it was barely warm and stuck in its sloshed around shape.  Their price point is quite high, and this is just unacceptable.  While this is the first time my pizza has been destroyed, it's par for the course in that it took 70+ minutes to reach me (2 min away) and was cold.  

For close to $30 (one large pizza and order of cheese bread--texture similar to a football and unsliced), I could have received more than double what I ordered from Dominos (across the street from Milano's), and it would have been here in 30 minutes, and would be hot and un-mangled.  

I really tried, but for what they charge vs the final product and delivery time, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Best Antipasto salad ever, it is big enough for two glad we ordered one.  We both ordered the Stromboli' which is big enough for two but  that is ok now we can enjoy them for dinner too.  A must when you are in the area.  We are staying at Camp Wilderness at Carowinds so it was very convenient and they deliver if you prefer."}
{"text":"Big fan of their Buffalo Chicken Calzone. Their wings are some of the best quality in town! 

Very friendly people overall. I still find myself driving out of my way to grab a calzone from time to time despite the fact I've moved out of the neighborhood. I definitely miss having them just down the road.

Worth a try at the very least!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and the service is outstanding. Everyone there is very nice and courteous. Newly renovated and the atmosphere is fresh and contemporary. A+"}
{"text":"Let's take care of the less impressive aspects first:
We ordered delivery and it took over an hour for what was promised as 30-45 minutes... at 2:30pm on a Sunday... come on now! The pizza and appetizer were both room temperature. The meatballs were nice and warm, but the sauce leaked from the to-go container onto EVERYTHING else, including my carpet. 
Now the good stuff! - the pizza was pretty good, especially considering delivery options in the immediate vicinity. Margarita pizza had plenty of tomatoes and basil, with a fluffy crust, which is hard to come by with other fast food pizza joints. We got the Milano's sampler for an appetizer- it's everything you would expect out of a fried food app, but everyone here was pleased. I enjoyed the jalapeño poppers more than I thought I would and I had a hard time not putting a straw into the included red sauce. The meatballs were great! NOT over mixed or dense like many tend to be.
3.5 would be a more accurate rating, but gave them the bump because there were a few good surprises. As long as you're mentally prepared to wait longer than you expect and possibly need to reheat, you'll still be happy with the product delivered. I'm looking forward to trying more from the menu."}
{"text":"Very easy online ordering. Food was great. Tastes fresh and authentic. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"After ordering from here many many times I'm giving the 3 stars with a HUGE asterisk! Their pizza is great if its cooked all the way, their wings are usually amazing, but their blue cheese dip is a water sloppy mess that doesn't pass the test. Their other menu items are rather average and the owner seems to really care about his customers and fix things if you are not happy with your order. The fried mushrooms are disgusting, so avoid that menu item. Seriously their pizza and wings rival any joint around town if cooked properly*. I've had a few instances of undercooked wings and undercooked pizza. Definitely better than chain food but a little more expensive and not justifiably so. They recently changed up their pricing and made everything even more expensive, so I doubt I will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I think the no cars in the parking lot should have been my first clue at 7 pm on a Sun eve. The no one in the restaurant was my second. Pizza was ok and the salad was ok."}
{"text":"We were in town staying at a hotel and the front desk person recommended Milano's.  Maybe they were having an off night but I was not impressed at all.  Delivery took 1.5 hours from when we ordered and then the food was cold and the pizza was no different/better than any other place - just basic pizza"}
{"text":"Please avoid this place. Had bad experiences after the other. The last straw was when I asked a Philly cheesesteak ONLY with American cheese & oil and vinegar 

I Received a Philly cheesesteak with mushrooms and green peppers. I told the manager I didn't request this , he said its my fault, stuff already comes on the cheesesteak REGARDLESS of what I requested (American cheese & oil & vinegar) I was shocked. No apology or anything. Walked about with no refund or no sandwich. This restaurant sucks people if you want real Italian food in Charlotte go to Joe Mammas, it's on south tryon but further down. I'm from NY and these guys would be outta business if they pulled something off like that there!"}
{"text":"This evening I had Milano's for the first time and could not wait to share how good it was. The employees were very kind and accommodating. I have had a lot of pizza in the Charlotte area and I may have to say this is the best. I don't typically write about places I eat, but this place is worth the time to write a review. I ordered via phone and picked up within 20 minutes (food was hot and fresh), but next time I look forward to trying their delivery service."}
{"text":"This is a really good pizza place! The 1 star calzone is my favorite - actually this is the best place to get a calzone in Charlotte. The staff here is also very friendly. I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Used to have really good specials - 21.95 for 2 large pizzas, 22.95 for 1 large pizza and wings. Would order every couple of weeks. Now they've jacked up the prices by a lot and I don't think I'll be ordering again. Way to lose a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible
I had eaten there a few times, had ordered delivery several times.  Went in today around 11, no one in there except a waitress and her children, seated myself, she finally wondered over, I told her a wanted a pepsi with no ice, she wanted to know did I want to order, told her I wanted to look at the menu for a minute (it was not like they were busy, NO other customers).  This seemed to make her mad.  finally she came with my drink, said oh you didn't want ice, took about 10 minutes for her to come back with my drink, had a sullen expression, asked her if there was a manager, she said I would have to wait, about 30 minutes later a man came in, said the waitress was an owner and he would check with the security cameras to see if she was rude?  He took my order, brought salad and bread about 15 minutes later.  After 30 more minutes he finally brought my food, told him at this point I needed it to go.  Gave me change in ones, I guess so I could leave a tip for the horrible customer service?  Seemed to be setting up for a family birthday party, they should just close if they don't want to have customers in there and just do delivery, that seems to work out okay."}
{"text":"Personally I like their pizza.. not a bad price for a decently cooked pizza.  I do wish they would revamp the wings.. they are ok, but not something I would just order... you can get better wings at other places.."}
{"text":"I used yelp to order lunch. Allowed for the time given for pickup. Drove ten minutes to pickup and when I got to restaurant I was asked \"what order \". The woman found my order on her fax machine and said \"oh, I didn't see that \". It will be another 15 minutes for us to make now. Hello!!! I am on lunch from work. That is why I used yelp! The lady didn't offer anything for my troubles. Went through Burger King drive through and ten minutes late on lunch getting back. Milano' calls yelp and tells them I cancelled order. What??!! Yelp calls me. I explain what happened and they said they would email a gift certificate. That was last Wednesday. Didn't receive anything. Very disappointed with entire experience"}
{"text":"I wish I did not have to give a star. Don't order delivery from here. When it arrived at the hotel the pizza was cold. Minimum order is $35. Ordered $40. Both pizzas were cold. Cheese not moving even the grease was dormant. Call to get it rectified and Vava/Vera offers to refund $10. We arrived from out of town with hungry young children.
Now on our way to take them back to them to get our money back (Update: she says not to return them because they are closing). 
Ridiculous. Tried to say it says 45-60 minutes and this is the reason they were cold. I understand the wait time to make and deliver. She said it should have taken her delivery person five minutes to get to our hotel. She shared, she watched him leave fifteen minutes before. My adult daughter found the gentleman on the elevator. We gave him a tip for food we can't eat or heat up, without it being a soggy mess. Stay away if you are ordering delivery. 
Update:
They said I shouldn't expect delivered pizza to be hot. Really? 
Offered to refund money(2/17): no refund
Manager (2/18) : said pizza may not be hot when delivered. No refund 
Yelp: (2/18) manager said if we return food he'll refund. Too bad we returned home, four hours away and left their pizza in room 417 at the Renaissance."}
{"text":"Let me first say that this place has good food.  We've eaten there pretty regularly by delivery only with no problems until tonight.  Here is how it went down.  I called to get my regular Milano's special and wanted to substitute mushrooms for fries (like I always do) and I was told to \"hold let me ask my manager\".  Then the lady (obviously new) came back to the phone and said \"you can only substitute onion rings\".  I said I've done this 10-20 other times so don't see why it's different now.  She said sorry manager said no.  Then I asked her to speak to the manager.  She said \"no he's busy unpacking boxes\". I then proceeded to tell her that I would  never again order from that establishment and hung up.  It's ashame because they have really good food but this one horrible customer service episode did it for me."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and that's coming from someone who's from NY. That also have a big menu, all of it's great. Definitely the go to place for good food fast."}
{"text":"The food is delicious - but pick it up cuz delivery has drastically declined in the last few months. I ordered at 4:06. At 5:45 they arrive. He tells me there was traffic. NOT BEFORE 5 there wasnt....I ask if that pie is even still warm. Oh yes sir. Let me see I say. Nope, ICE COLD."}
{"text":"Great eggplant parmesan pasta & veggie pizza. I will definitely look them up when I am in the Charlotte area again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened with all these people complaining about the delivery but I got mine delivered nice and hot within the 35-ish minutes quoted to me.  This is seriously some the best pizza I've had since I left Chicago. It's always fresh, lots of cheese which you can tell is REAL cheese (a little chewy, sometimes a little squeaky when you chew it), the ingredients are nice and fresh and the dough isn't super heavy and thick like with pizza chains.  I order it when I'm stuck at work alone all day and have to eat every meal in my store.  I guess my only complaint is that when I eat an entire large pizza myself in one day I'm bound to get fat, but my tastebuds say it's worth it!  Try this place out if you actually LIKE real pizza and don't consider domino's and Pizza Hut to be real."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! I travel a lot and one of my favorite things in different cities is to try a locally owned pizza place. Delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and breadsticks were hot on arrival and the delivery guy was friendly. 

The breadsticks came with a really flavorful sauce and themselves were perfectly baked and seasoned. The pizza was just a cheese pizza and the ratio of cheese/sauce/crust was on point and tasted great! 

As much pizza as I eat I ought to be considered an expert and if I wasn't leaving town tomorrow I'd be visiting these guys again. Great food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"After a spending a LONG day at Carowinds and trying to find a good restaurant opened at 10:30pm we ran into Milanos and were greeted by the nicest man who was so eager to feed us seeing how exhausted and hungry we were :) not only was he so nice but he gave us extra drinks to take back to our hotel room. The experience alone was enough for us and then we ate our pizzas and salad....WOW! DELICIOUS food! Nothing short of great quality yummy food! Thank you Milanos!"}
{"text":"Best pizza delivery in the area. Sure, sometimes delivery can be slow if you order at 7pm on a Friday evening but this is not a huge chain. Pizza is awesome and the ziti is good as well. Get dessert."}
{"text":"Real good Italian food and real great taste. Don't worry about the location it is in. The food is always delicious and hot."}
{"text":"Good food, but even better service. Sometimes family run places can be a bit stand-offish, but my experience here was the exact opposite. Chicken parm is goooood!"}
{"text":"Not sure about the food but arrived at 11:21 Saturday night and they were closed. Posted hours state 12."}
{"text":"Ii just moved to the Charlotte area and my bf and I were looking through yelp for a good pizza place that delivers. I came upon Milanos and read even reviews between good and bad. Quite skeptical, I ordered anyways and this pizza is pretty DARN GOOD AND THEY DELIVER. There is no comparison with domino's. I love pizza and all about quality and they do a pretty damn job. I will definitely order again. I highly recommend this place. Not to say they got to our house within 40 min which is pretty awesome! I don't understand how people do not like this place. I'm glad I went against the people that did not like this place because it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. A little expensive for a meal. Idk if the pizza is as expensive but my fettuccine Alfredo with chicken with a combo was $18! I thought okay this has to be amazing if it's this expensive. Wrong. I open my meal to see that my pasta looks like soup. I stirred it and let it sit for a few mins in hopes it would thicken but I was wrong. I took a few bites and threw it away. Highly upset that I could have made a better fettuccine Alfredo at home. The only reason I would go back is to try the pizza...maybe."}
{"text":"Ordered a few sandwiches and a pizza for takeout. A very nice gentleman took the order, helped me with directions and kept the light on til I got there. I had very low expectations because I wasn't sure how good pizza and grinders would be in NC, but they were well made and tasty. And even though my order was done right around closing time, the food wasn't rushed...perfect amount of doneness on the grinders (super toasty) and pizza
We didn't order anything fancy and nothing green...it was just late grub after a longgggg travel day. I would recommend it to anyone within a 15 min drive, especially for takeout. The restaurant isn't beautiful. It's a strip-mall place that is a bit dated."}
{"text":"I ordered large cheese pizza for pick up and everything was great. Pizza is what you would expect, and was ready on time. Will probably order again next time I feel like pizza for dinner."}
{"text":"My first review. I have been living in CLT for over 2 years now and failed to hit this place. Finally decided to go here and it was worth every penny. I had the Chicken Alfredo fettuccine and my taste buds were satisfied  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yes, a pizza delivered sounds like a good idea. And Milano's is on the Yelp EAT24 system so we went through the wizard and paid for it. The confirming email says \"45-60 minutes.\" At 80 minutes, I pinged customer service who said \"The restaurant assured me that the driver has departed with your order and should be pulling up momentarily.\" Yes, he arrived momentarily if your definition of momentarily is 40 minutes later. My home is 2.8 miles from the restaurant.

The sandwich was good and the salad was good and the pizza (once reheated) was good. They followed my special requests to leave things off or on, which was good.

So. It took two hours. The pizza was room temperature. Cold pizza an hour late? I won't be ordering from Milano's again and I would say \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"This was not a good place to order delivery from, the order was completely wrong and was not good at all. Pizza was incredibly bad and wings were terrible. I ordered a 14\" pizza got a 10\", ordered a combo received a veggie, ordered garlic wings got hot, would not recommend this place for travelers."}
