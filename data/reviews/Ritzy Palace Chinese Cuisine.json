{"text":"Was greeted right away upon arrival as the restaurant wasn't really busy given for a weekday.   They didn't offer a wide selection of dimsum on the menu. They charged $1.50 for tea per person but the tea didn't even taste like what we asked for and it also wasn't hot. The taste of dimsum was just mediocre overall; wasn't anything outstanding. Think it's a bit overpriced for what it is (quality wise).   What I liked was that they offered mango mochi on their dessert menu and also we got 10% off the bill."}
{"text":"This is the WORST dim sum place I have eaten at in my entire life. And I've eaten at a LOT of dim sum restaurants.   As soon as I walked in I had a feeling I wouldn't like it. It didn't look dirty at first glance but it felt dirty when we were at the table. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting.   As for the food, I couldn't even eat it. The chicken feet tasted like leftovers from a week ago that was re-heated and the sauce did not taste good at all either. The tripe was oversteamed, too chewy and overall just plain bad.   Their beef rice noodle roll was slimy and you could tell the meat was bad quality. I couldn't even swallow it, I had to spit it out. THAT'S how bad it is.  Other dishes we had were rice noodle roll in XO sauce and fried rice noodle with soya sauce, and they were super oily and overdone.  The only good dish I had were the taro spring rolls, but they weren't good enough to make this review more than a one star.   If I could I would give this place zero stars."}
{"text":"I quite like this unique place with bright yellow sign and old school Chinese restaurant name.  Love it.  The indoor decor however looks a little too grand for my taste.  There are a lot of crystal chandeliers, with golden colour everywhere.  I think the servers should wear matching colours too to make the golden decoration complete, but their uniforms looks quite normal,  lol!    I arrived around 1pm which is the regular price period, and the dim sums are quite pricey.  All the food are quite good, but I still think it is a little over price.  The highlight for me is the steamed beef tendons with konnyaku as it was soft enough to eat but not mushy with some wonderful aromatic to heighten the taste.  The service was reasonable, but not great.  i do like the fact that they are playing the food documentary on the screen where I learned something about traditional food preparation method of some new year Chinese food."}
{"text":"Came here for my father in law's birthday dinner. He heard that the restaurant offers half priced deals for dinner so our whole family came to try on a week night. We were a little disappointed that we could only order one item from the half priced deals. And I find the food selection is quite limited but we ended up ordering a chicken from their half price promo, steamed eel, sweet and sour pork, e fu noodles, fried rice, garlic veggies, veggies hot pot and honey fried oysters. The steamed eel was huge. They claimed to be around 3-3.5 lbs but for $78? That thing better be huge! Our chicken was cold as if it came straight out of the fridge. The soup which normally comes included from other comparable Chinese restaurants as a starter, costs extra here... In the end, our bill comes close to $300 for 7 adults and 2 kids. It is a bit pricey for the amount of food and its quality. There are a lot more affordable options out there in the area with the same quality."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my family - one of those multi-course meals.  The food was pretty good, but service was kind of lacking.  Maybe it's because the restaurant is new, but they didn't seem to know what they were doing, from not changing plates to bringing things together when they're supposed to.  Hopefully, this will change in the near future - once they're more established. I'd probably give the restaurant FEWER stars had they not been new.  Also, the restaurant really needs to be on social media.  ETA:  What's with the (English) name, anyway?  I mean, it could be really funny/tongue-in-cheek if they were a hole-in-the-wall congee/noodle/rice (jook-fun-mein-fan) type of restaurant, but they're not.  Instead, a name like theirs for the kind of restaurant they are is just plain tacky.  ETA 2: Lowered the number of stars because I really shouldn't have given them three!"}
{"text":"Little did I know that Ritzy Palace Chinese Cuisine is actually a sister restaurant of Grandeur Palace!  Ritzy Palace Chinese Cuisine opened up sometime last year at Woodbine and Denison where a previous Chinese restaurant, Spring Villa Chinese Cuisine, used to be.    When we walked into the restaurant for our dinner (where we had made a reservation for 7:45 p.m.) and we were waiting in the foyer area, I looked at their business card and that's when it showed that Grandeur Palace was their sister restaurant.  When we got seated and I looked around, no wonder the decor was so familiar!  The owners had overhauled the place to look exactly like Grandeur Palace's interior.  The only difference was that Grandeur Palace was a bit bigger and had many large windows.  Here, there weren't any windows and the space was a bit smaller.  Since my relatives dine at Grandeur Palace often, they also recognized a few of the staff that work there who are relocated to this location to work.  That night, the 15 of us ordered a set menu to share.  It was a lot of food and I was really impressed with how big the portions were.  It seemed like the portions here at Ritzy were bigger than the ones at Grandeur.  The tastes of the dishes were very good too.  They provide free wifi here but none of us were able to successfully surf or use the network after logging in.  Perhaps their network is weak or they need to fix the wifi."}
{"text":"We came because they had the half price deal for the Peking duck. Wasn't expecting much since reviews here aren't stellar but was pleasantly surprised. The food was actually pretty good although yes it was overpriced. I would say the taste was above average other Chinese restaurants though. I don't know if I would come again since it's pricey but I wouldn't turn it down either if I had to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a Saturday after 11 and was not impressed. This location is further than other dim sum places for me. But we came here because my dad was here recently with a friend and said it was okay. So we went to try it.   Every day before 11 am they have a morning special all sizes are 2.99 but after 11 am items are charged per size. A large was 4.99 (which most items are categorized as btw.)..sigh...already on the pricier side of dim sum places. What really annoyed was that they did not serve Guantang bao (soup dumpling). I've never been to a dim sum place that did not serve it...It's my favourite dish and I always get it! So from there, I had already set in my mind I would not return for dim sum. But carrying on with the rest of the food, it was decent nothing really stood out. The fried items were nice and crispy but the sauce for the beef tendon and beef ribs were really watered down :( I've definitely had better.   The location itself is new and was not busy considering it was a Saturday prime time. Location is decent plenty of parking since it is in a plaza with no other big restaurants. The decor is a typical Chinese restaurant however the entry way is very cramp little to no room for standing. The washroom is right near the entrance too so there are people walking back and forth constantly which would get annoying if it were busier.   The service was decent, they were very good with refilling water/tea which is sometimes hard to find in most dim sum places. Getting a table, in the beginning, took longer than needed, we saw a couple empty tables and it took the hostess a while to seat us. I guess she was too busy entertaining \"regulars\" -eye roll-  TL;DR: there are better dim sum places, did not have Guantang Bao (big soup dumpling), expensive, early bird special before 11 am."}
{"text":"Dirty plates and utensils. The chicken feet was frozen in the center. The pork with egg congee was luke warm. The bathrooms were disgusting and the toilets did not flush. The staff is slow and non responsive. And after all that, the price per dish was very high for the crappy quality.   Do not go to this place!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on opening night and wasn't impressed. For starters, their large front page advertisement in the newspaper had the wrong phone number, so we couldn't even call to book an appointment. Secondly, they list multiple specialty dishes as being 50% off during the grand opening, but we found out you are limited to ONLY ONE DISCOUNTED dish per table, which they didn't mention in the ad.   The atmosphere is quite nice and looks like the place has been newly renovated from the old Spring Villa restaurant that was here before. Except for the dirty soiled carpet which strangely they didn't bother replacing.   The food here is unfortunately nothing special. It's not bad, but not great. Also, the menu selection seems quite limited compared to other establishments. We got the one special discount oyster dish for half price, which was the only good tasty dish. Oysters were fresh (better be on  opening night) and nice and plump. Unfortunately the beef with veggies was bad, with the meat being of very cheap quality and chewy. The free run chicken was also nothing special. The red bean soup for dessert was almost all water and maybe 10 beans, but at least that was free.   The service here is SLOW! We ordered one extra dish after finishing the first three. After 30 mins of waiting we asked for them to check on the order, after 40 mins we asked again, and after 50 mins ended up cancelling the dish. Some servers are friendly and try to be helpful. Others are in serious need for some training.   It's their opening night so I will cut them some slack on the slow food service. But the mediocre quality of food and limited menu selection is a little disappointing. The dim sum menu looks more promising, so I'll likely give that a try, but unlikely I'll come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Strike 1: The name. It's tacky. It's really trying too hard.  Strike 2: The food isn't worth the prices. I'm talking regular prices, not early bird. Small is $2.90, I think, but there are only 4 on the entire menu, and 2 are desserts. Medium is $3.90, if I recall correctly. I mean, the food doesn't suck. It's okay. I've just had significantly better at that price point.  Strike 3: I'm Chinese. I speak Chinese. I can't read it though. I read #41: Braised Vegetarian Chicken (Tofu). I know what that is. I ordered it. I also read #40: King Tofu Roll. I ordered that too. When they came, I didn't realize those were the dishes I'd ordered. I wasn't the only one who ticked things off, so I assumed they weren't my orders until I asked if everything had come, heard the answer was yes, and noticed the dishes I thought I ordered weren't there. I asked the server. She pointed to the two that came. The first looked like a piece of taro, a piece of vegetarian chicken, a large piece of shiitake mushroom, and a piece of ham/sausage wrapped in bean curd sheet. The smallest of all the fillings was the vegetarian chicken. Based on the English, I was expecting an entire dish of vegetarian chicken, and not any of that other stuff. The second dish looked exactly like the first, except it didn't have the vegetarian chicken in it, and it was wrapped in steamed, sliced melon of some sort. There was no tofu. Clearly, neither of the dishes fit the English name. We called over one of the managers and explained our problem. He got super defensive really fast. He didn't begin with an apology. He started angrily explaining that they were a Chinese restaurant and that they could have mistranslated the dishes. He asked whether I understood where he was coming from like I was dumb. He kept saying it was about grammar, etc., and made it sound like it was my fault for saying something about it. After like five minutes of arguing with him, he basically angrily said, \"Well, do you want me to take them off your bill?\" Well, I wanted you to solve the issue in a civil way, but clearly, that didn't happen, so sure. Take them off my bill. I'm still not satisfied. After I said yes, he condescendingly said something along the lines of, \"Thank you for pointing out our problem. Sorry.\"   Side note: We had a server named Crystal who was delightful. She told Grandpa she'd mark that he got 10% off before the food came so he could put his VIP card away and not lose it before the end of our meal.   Ritzy Palace? With a name like that and prices that supposedly match the high class establishment you're trying to create, if your manager is going to act like a pompous king, he can pay to come here. I won't willingly be coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has replaced the former location of Spring Villa. The decor is a bit much considering it is not a big location. We lined up for early dim sum as we were told that they did not take reservations. However, there was some people who obviously cut the line.  We finally got our table in time for the early bird special where everything from small to large was under $3. We tried a wide variety of dishes and they were somewhat unique. Overall, the food was not too special and I would not come when it's at regular prices. The service was ok and I could not recall the per person tea charge that most dim sum restaurants now include in the bill."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ok?????????????????"}
{"text":"Mediocre and over priced.  Came here for a family dinner.  Decor: Lots of gold and white. Gaudy yet tacky.   Service: Unorganized and awkward with food servers needing to wait for your waiter to come to your table to help them make space to put your food down. So the food would show up in some guy's hands and he'd stand there and stare at you while you eat until someone came to help him put it down. The servers have almost no social skills. When you thank them they ignore you.  Cleanliness: When we first sat down we had to replace a dish because it was so oily. I grabbed a plate from another empty table and it had food bits all over it, so I had to snag yet another one. My bowl was chipped and dinged up too. When dessert came the forks had food bits still left on it. One bit looked like a large piece of tomato skin.  Food: Very underwhelming. We had the peking duck which had almost no meat, just skins and they didn't cut it in front of you which tells me they likely don't make it in their kitchen. The wraps were cold. The flavour was okay though. Texture was dry, not crispy.  The mixed mushroom stir fry was very bland except the oyster mushroom that was very flavourful.  The deep fried oysters with honey pepper sauce was pretty good. It comes with 8 pieces of large oysters and a few broccoli.   Dessert: Well Chinese dessert in my opinion is a culinary failure. Such weird combinations. We had green mung bean soup which I've had at other places before and didn't mind it but this place seems to have a non sweet and barf look-a-like version.   Bill came out to $75~  I'd recommend this place if you lost a bet and owe someone you especially dislike a dinner."}
{"text":"On my last 2 visits for dimsum the food has been a bit disappointing, especially the siu mai (pork dumpling). Service was not great either."}
{"text":"Was here for Father's Day dinner. We opt for the $588 combo ( Cash Only) which is for 10ppl and includes the following:   1. Suckling pig with jelly fish- 4/5 2. Fried Shrimp balls 3/5  3. Stir fry beans, shrimp & scallops- 4/5 4. Shark fin soup- 3/5  5. Bok Choy with goose feet- 3/5  6. Chicken- 2.5/5 (didn't like the sauce)  7. Maggi Lobster 4lbs- 2.5/5 (was on sweeter side)  8. Double steamed fish- 4/5  9. Lotus leaf steamed rice- 4/5  10. Noodles 1/5 (didn't have efu noodles)  11. Pastries & red bean desert 3/5   Was at the meal worth it? Yes, if you have a big group, you get a lot of dishes and the service was good, they help us change dishes several times. The interior is very bright with good lighting so good for photos! As for food, some dishes are good and some aren't as good, but overall 3/5"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday morning. Despite coming in at 9:45am, there was a long line waiting for tables. Food portion is reasonable and you can find many staple food as well as some uncommon ones. Price is a little more expensive than other dim sum restaurants in Richmond Hill and Markham. The main issue that dragged down my rating was their service. Some had the \"I don't care\" attitude and a few were impolite. This seems to suggest that management issue could be involved"}
{"text":"The dim sums are really good.  Recommended : ???? ????? ???? ??.  Must try: mango Mochi!!!!!!! Best Mochi ever !  The customer service is alright."}
{"text":"Ritzy Palace's predecessor used to be Spring Villa, one of my favorite dim sum places. Dining room decor was impressive. Ritzy's food is very good. Shrimp and chive rice noodle rolls had large yummy tasting shrimps but were missing the chives. The sticky rice with egg yolks/meat, hargow and shrimp sui mi were delicious. The Seafood congee tasted great and would have been perfect if it was slightly hotter.  Service was good. Restrooms were acceptable."}
{"text":"Ritzy Palace Chinese Cuisine's half price special during during time is a good deal. Even though the selections  is limited and you only allow to order one special from the menu.  The rest of the menu is quite standard. If you are into Cantonese food, you will find them quite OK.  Service is friendly especially if you are a regular.   Not a bad choice for dinner if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Food was okay but terrible service ruined the overall experience. Waiters require some training in basic social skills, as it became a game to see who would first crack a smile or say a polite word.   And the icing on the cake - we were charged $4.50 for tea even though we didn't order tea, \"as a service charge\" and then when we disputed the charge, the waiter told us to \"stop arguing and just pay.\"   There are plenty of other restaurants that offer comparable food with happier people."}
{"text":"Slow service plus average dim sum set in a cringe worthy who-on-earth-decorated-this-place at a higher price point. Lol yeah I think that pretty much sums it up. Maybe this was why there wasn't much of a wait here.  Ok items: Ha gow Fish rice roll Chicken feet Cha siu baos  You might want to avoid: Taro nest triangles (what are these really called?) Milk tarts Dough fritter rice rolls Spring rolls  Wonder which restaurant will replace this one in a few months!"}
