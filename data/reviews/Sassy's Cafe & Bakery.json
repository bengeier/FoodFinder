{"text":"The best cinnamon roll I've ever had. (And I've had a lot.)  The guy at the counter was very friendly and helpful.  I took home some cupcakes and a brownie, which were good but not my favorites.  But I'll be sure to stop by whenever I'm in the area for another cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"I hate styrofoam plates.    French toast was amazing.  Service was friendly and they were super busy with some civic function when we dropped in.  The decor is cute, but the location is a little off the beaten path.   Even so, it was a decent little place for a fun breakfast.  Definitely will give this place a second look if we get down to this part of Arizona again.    This place is A~Okay!"}
{"text":"It seems like every time I come in, this is visit 4, I leave disappointed. I really wanted to like this place because it's so close to where I live. But their hours are inconvenient, the service is always mediocre, and I can't seem to order a cake no matter the lead time I give them, it's always some event that comes up where they can't or the cake I would like to order, I didn't give enough lead time, etc. Now I came in for cupcakes and received the coldest reception/purchase experience ever. They sent me a coupon to use via email for a free cupcake, tried to redeem it, but the cashier was not having it. She kept talking down at me and insinuated that my coupon was a fake. Its not my fault their coupon system doesnt work! That's it, done here."}
{"text":"Good local place, pretty decent food, and the best cinnamon rolls ever!  I can't eat any baked goods from super markets (yuck).  I am very picky when it comes to sweets but these hit it out of the ballpark!"}
{"text":"We have been to Sassy's many times and truly love their pastries, cupcakes and cookies. On this visit I took my toddler in for a cookie and she requested to eat her cookie at a table while we were there. There was one other customer dining in besides us. At another table the owners/bakers/employees were sitting and talking and being one table over with my child, their topics of conversation were completely inappropriate and their use of curse words was shocking! I was seriously uncomfortable the whole time and tried to distract my toddler from hearing any of their conversations, which was hard because they were not quiet about it at all. I am really kind of upset that what was once a fun place to take my children for sweet treats, my family can no longer go to."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my family.  I ordered 3 dozen mini cupcakes for a bridal shower over the phone, since I live out of town and was shocked that their mini cupcakes are extremely small, about a fifth the size of a regular cupcake. I have had many mini cupcakes in my life an these were a third of the size regular cupcakes. I would refer to these as sample size cup cakes. I was then told by the lady giving me the order that they have three sizes of cupcakes when their website only listed two. I wished the lady who took my order had explained to me their mini size is not the normal mini cupcake size. I ended up having to buy two dozen regular sized rather than serving these cupcakes. The cupcakes themselves were well received but I was extremely disappointed with wasting $40 on cupcakes I could not use."}
{"text":"So good! We've had breakfast here multiple times. Food is great, coffee is delish. Love the baked goods as well (duh)."}
{"text":"Sassy's Pi√±a Colada French Toast is so delicious that my husband said he's certain it is served in heaven. The Stacker is delicious with either sausage or chorizo. The service was great. They were very attentive and quickly fixed their mistake on another customer's order. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here for the first time. Great food and friendly service. Love the Cronut!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food and service has always been very good!  Cute place and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Their cinnamon buns are the best I've ever had.  They also have great cupcakes, huge variety for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place.  We have a group of  16 - 18 ladies.    The leader of our group made arrangements. Whole month in advance.     We arrived and the tables were NOT set up for us.    Extremely disappointing.  Probably will NOT come back again.    Why bother with reservations, if the one you talk to on the phone does not pass the information on to the hostess or owners.  Poorly run business."}
{"text":"Maybe their cookies, donuts, sandwiches are good, but I ordered a Birthday Cake for my 96 year old mother hoping it would taste like a fresh baked cake instead of a frozen grocery  store cake and paid $52.00 for nothing.  I should have went to AJ's or the Cheese Factory for that amount of money and get a better tasting cake.  Sassys tasted like a week old pound cake.  No more business from me! Jeannette"}
{"text":"Do they take bitcoin. No. Do they have free wifi. Yes. Do they have to reset it to get it to work every time I go in. Yes. I like Sassy's for breakfast. Good waffles, hash browns, etc. Looks like I'm going to have to try the cinnamon roll! It's a nice quiet place to have a meeting. Booths and tables, and if you don't finish your meal, they bring you a lid that snaps right onto the plate you just ate from. Pretty genius."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Hawaii and just saw Mel on the show a few days ago and HAD to go to the bakery. I was so excited when I saw her in the parking lot. I seriously got star struck and felt like I should ask for her autograph :) But the food.... simply amazing!!! I'm just here visiting but I will be back for sure, at least once maybe twice.  He husband, was so kind, sweet, and funny. They are a small business and deserve a stop in. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!!! I got my wedding cake made at Sassy's cafe and not only did the cake look AMAZING! But it was so delicious!!!!! Thank you so much for everything!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I'm the first to write a review for this delicious bakery!!  You MUST go try this place!!!  Especially for breakfast!  And the desserts are absolutely to die for!!!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at the bakery I ordered 2 dozen mini cupcakes chocolate and vanilla. They where really good, moist and very flavorful I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BBQ pork sandwich was great! Don't go there if you don't like styrofoam dishes and cups. I would go there again!"}
{"text":"Yummers! Not only was the food great the owner and staff are very friendly as well. My partner and I  stopped in for lunch after a day of wedding planning. The owner checked on us to make sure we were satisfied and inquired about our day. When we divulged we had just come from a cake tasting she informed us that she also creates wedding cakes and offered us two complimentary cupcakes to get a little idea of her flavors (which are abundant and AMAZING). After checking out her site we have decided to give her a shot and are excited to schedule a tasting. We will definitely be coming back for lunch we just wish this place was closer to phx! =)"}
{"text":"I thought it was wonderful! The food tasted great. I thought it was a little pricey. My husband got the pulled pork sandwich which was delicious. But for a sandwich and a drink-no side it was 13 dollars. I got the quiche and a tea-7 dollars. (my quiche was a small slice).So overall I would come again. A little on the expensive side which is why I gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love this bakery/cafe. I found the staff to be friendly and very helpful. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and spaciously designed. This is a warm, welcoming place to meet with friends and family for a great homemade meal and dessert like grandma used to make.   If you need a catered event this is perfect. The prices are reasonable and will leave your guests begging for more. The owner makes beautiful wedding cakes. I will always recommend Sassy's to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot,  I had the breakfast sandwich, hash browns and a side of bacon and everything was cooked perfectly to my order.  Even the cook came out to ask how things were.  That always goes a long way and shows how much pride and care they have."}
{"text":"More than 2 years later and they still make the best cupcakes around.  Their coffee is also really good - a medium roast (not like a starbucks medium roast that tastes more like an almost French roast) that is almost as good as the coffee I make at home with an Aeropress."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant we tried for lunch.  The food was delicious.  We tried the chicken salad croissant and had a Caesar salad with it.  I love how every plate comes with a mini cupcake - so good!! Great food, food came fast, but my only complaint was the counter service was awful.  We stood waiting to order treats to take home for at least 5 mins with no one else in line.  Employees would walk by and ignore us.  The cashier walked by and told us just a minute but right before she helped us, the phone rang with someone wanting a custom order.  Instead of putting them on hold or calling for backup, she proceeded to take a very long phone call, going into the back to ask questions multiple times, while again ignoring us in addition to several more customers.  After 5 more minutes we gave up and left-- this was after 2 other people in line behind us had also left."}
{"text":"For valentines day i wanted to do something special for my boyfriend. Baking isn't my strong suit, so i opted out of baking one of his favorite cakes, apple spice. I've never been to sassy's before, i just searched apple spice cake bakeries online. Once i found the bakery i called like two days before valentines day, the pastry department was really nice and helpful. Not knowing what to pair the cake with; fillings icing ext.. The helpful employee talked me through each option, i decided on a apple spice cake with a mousse filling, walnuts and topped with the most amazing whipped cream topping. Great price, decorated nice and clean. I'm rating my experience 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that i ordered walnuts and you could rarely see or taste them in any slice,  the lack of nuts was very disappointing for such a delicious cake. Next time i suppose i\"ll just have to emphasize heavy on the nuts.Looking forward to my next baked good from sassys cakes!"}
{"text":"I think that the cupcakes are comparable to sprinkles and I think I'm a cupcake snob. The right sweet and not dry. I haven't returned in but I'm sure that's just as good"}
{"text":"I tried Sassy's this past Saturday morning with three friends to treat them for helping me out with a dinner event.  A gal I work with had said it was good.  We arrived at 10 a.m. hoping to be able to order breakfast or lunch but they only serve breakfast until 10:30 and no lunch until 10:30.  No one greeted us upon arrival so I asked the young man behind the counter if we needed to seat ourselves.  He was very friendly and explained the procedure of ordering at the counter.  We ordered two quiche plates that they said came with a small cup of fruit only so we ordered two sides of bacon to go with.  We also ordered the ala carte breakfast of two sides of bacon, two egg orders (one poached and one over easy) two toast and one crispy hash browns.  Then we asked for four waters and two cups of coffee.  The other ladies sat and I waited at the counter for drinks.  We only got two coffees and two waters and had to ask them to refill the creamers.  The water crock was empty.  Our quiche came to the table.  Very small slices and NO fruit.  The hash browns were very undercooked and we got TWO orders. The over easy eggs had NO runny yolk and the poached eggs came over easy.  The toast came dry.  I went back to the counter and asked for butter and jelly.  There were at least four people in the kitchen and the young man at the counter.  They handed me 2 butter packs and one small container of jelly.  Then I asked about the fruit with the quiche.  The young lady put on one glove, reached into the strawberries and handed me ONE strawberry for two orders.  I said \"You couldn't put it on a small plate\"?  I did not take it.  Then I inquired about the hash browns being undercooked and asked if we could send them back but they said they don't do that they would have to make a new order.  A few minutes later a man brought 3 strawberries in a plastic container to our table.  I expressed our displeasure of the way things were going.    A while later fresh hashbrowns came.  After that - NO ONE ever came to our table.  No refill of water, no offer of more coffee, no inquiry as to how anything was or if we needed anything.  There was one other table in the restaurant - a table of 8 ladies who ordered after we did.  We were polite, not unruly.  We are employees and retirees of the school district.  The bacon and quiche did taste good. There were NO desserts in the display case except for large chocolate cookies.   I believe in order to be successful you will need to work on the staff's interaction with customers and I understand not having table service but it would be nice to at least get more water.  Maybe someone could walk around with a pitcher and at least ask if things are okay.  I was so disappointed that I feel like I owe my friends another treat to thank them for their helping me.  There are an awful lot of restaurants to choose from and I do not believe I will visit Sassy's again.  I drove from close to Meridian and University to visit.  Good luck to you!"}
{"text":"The pastries are awesome. The atmosphere is a great local bakery and restaurant with good seating. I like to go here to catch up on my work email. But the service is lacking because they like to stand around and chat with their friends rather than wait on the other customers that have been standing at the counter. I seem to experience this 75% of the time. It is good to be personal with your clients, but make sure someone is taking care of your other customers too. They could use a lot of practice in that regard. Back to the pastries though, absolutely awesome and worth the stop. No doubt."}
{"text":"Melody could not have been more amazing to work with! I had an out of town engagement and she delivered cinnamon rolls to my hotel - and they were the best beyond amazing ! She clearly loves what she does and her cakes! Wow! Perfection! I would highly recommend this bakery!! I look forward to trying everything on the menu when I bring my husband Andrew to AZ!! Thanks for such a wonderful experience !"}
{"text":"The food was incredible, especially the pancakes. Staff was helpful and friendly. The portions were generous and the strawberries were the freshest I've ever had. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am  writting this review while sitting at Sassy's, I've been here only twice but have decided that this is my new \"go to\" joint. I've tried their breakfast and their lunch as well as cupcakes and cookies and I have not been disapointed with anything. The chicken  salad sandwich is the best I've ever had ...EVER....PERIOD!  To let you know how good this joint is I travel from Hunt Highway in south Gilbert to visit Sassy's and it is worth every mile traveled. So in a nutshell all I can say is GO TO SASSY'S NOW...that is all."}
{"text":"This place was so good!  I got a mozzarella, tomato, and basil panini for lunch and it was DE-LISH.  I also got 4 cupcakes to go, and they were all amazing!  Better cupcakes than \"Sprinkles.\"  I am going to be a regular :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice now for breakfast.  The first time was with a Groupon and the second we were repeat customers.  So, that tells you that we liked it enough to go back, right?  Breakfast: The breakfasts here are super duper sweet.  I adore the cinnamon roll french toast and I've tried both the pina colada french toast and the crepes (off of hubbie's plate) and enjoyed those as well.  I can't decide whether I like the fact that there's not an automatic combination plate available or whether I really like the option to add a la carte pieces to my breakfast.  Adding two eggs to the french toast is $1.49.  Three slices of thick bacon is another $1.49.  The eggs were a perfect over-medium both times, but the bacon was short of the well-done I ordered the last time.    Bakery: This last time we went, we decided to get  some cupcakes to take home.  I don't think I'll do that again.  For a regular sized cupcake that I could make in my kitchen at home, it was $1.50.  But wait.  There weren't any regular cupcakes available, so I had to purchase filled cupcakes at $2.50 a pop.  $10 for 4 cupcakes just seems high to me for the quality and size received.  I won't be purchasing them again.    Service: The staff is perfectly nice, but could definitely afford to smile more.  I get that the name is Sassy's, but you can smile with sass.  Promise.  That said, service is definitely good.  We even commented that it is better than a lot of server-based restaurants.  We're always greeted on our way in and asked if we need help with the menu, and thanked on the way out, our waters are refilled a couple of times without us having to leave our seats.  Customer service isn't an issue.    The atmosphere is a little cutesy for my tastes, with maroon and pink and expected decor, but the quality of the food will keep me going back.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great local breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place to have a fantastic lunch! Love the lunch items, especially the salads and the little cupcake treat: awesome! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Has a quick menu to grab a bite to eat and the cakes are wonderful we keep coming back and the cost is fair for what you get"}
{"text":"Went to Sassys for lunch and had the sassy club. Everyone at my table got something different and we loved everything. And every plate gets a red velvet mini cupcake that was beyond amazing I had to get one for dessert. Overall an amazing service and food. Great dining experience! Definitely going back, I highly recommend Sassy's cafe and bakery!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place by using the 'nearby' choice on Yelp --headed in for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. There are not many restaurant choices in this area if you don't want to eat Mexican, so finding a sandwich and salad place with tempting baked goods was awesome! We got sandwiches and were pleasantly surprised by the small cupcake treat that accompanied our lunch. The staff and service was out of this world.  And the food was really really really yummy! I would recommend this place to anyone. :-)"}
{"text":"4 stats for the food, 2 stars for the urgency that your employees show. I've been sitting here watching for almost 10 minutes, waitinf on a friend to get here. It took one girl OVER 6 minutes to get cookies boxed up for a customer. There were 4 of us in line  (3 if I don't count myself bc I am sitting and technically not in line). Another girl came out and leaned up against the bakery counter and just stared outside, then looked at all of us and then left. Having only 1 person up front during the 11am to 1pm hours is NOT a smart business move. I sincerely hope that moving to this new location hasn't led you to forget about taking care of your customers. Love the new place and layout, LOVE the food. Like I said, SPEED UP your sense of urgency!"}
{"text":"I am late writing this... but I experienced the greatest customer service from these people. Melody made me a wedding cake 2 years ago and it was so damn delicious, I went back a year later and had them make my anniversary cake. They also gave me a really great deal on the wedding cake. She even ended up using fondant when it wasn't part of the original plan and didn't charge for it. I have not tried any of the other foods, so this review is only of their desserts. Most excellent."}
{"text":"So amazing food. Breakfast burrito, turkey avacodo sandwich, quiche, and of course some cupcakes for desert. We were all so amazed at the high quality of the food. Will so be back."}
{"text":"Was very delicious. We will definately be back sooner to try some desserts and other options."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is great and they did the cake cupcakes and cookies for our baby shower and they were Absolutely beautiful would highly recommend them"}
{"text":"I've come in for coffee on and off the past couple weeks. They have a good brew, I've tried two different cupcakes and they were amazing the red velvet cheescake  and the other I forgot the name of. I'm usually rushing to the office and never have time to try their food so this morning I said what hell I can be a little late. I ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage, it was plated very nicely for a burrito and taste like love rolled in a hot blanket. My tortilla was goldened by the stove which I appreciated because I am very picky. I like cooked not just warmed tortillas, color is flavor.   The girls up front and in the back are very nice, always smiling and always helpful. I ask a question they have the answer.  The dinning room has nice open seating with either booth or table options. The decor is easy on the eyes and very inviting. I look forward to trying other food from the menu, I will be coming back very soon. If you have a sweet tooth ... Be careful .. You might never leave ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing desserts. Don't come here if you're in a hurry. It takes a while to order and if there is a line you're going to be waiting quite a while. Every once in a while food comes out super fast but it can take some time too. A half salad is plenty. I love the mixed berry salad. Everything comes with a little red velvet cupcake. The 4/5 stars is for wait time and prices. It's far too expensive to come here regularly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Love the cronuts. And the people are so very friendly! A must try! And you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"I ordered a graduation cake 2 weeks prior to the event. I was very specific with no buttercream frosting. It was to be a red velvet cake with whipped frosting with school colors. I drove to downtown Mesa approx 13 mi one way after texting the lady that I was coming for the cake. Never heard back and it was after the time the cake was supposed to be ready. When I got there, I waited a full 5 minutes before anyone asked if they could help me, seemed like I was inconveniencing them. They asked me what time I needed the cake, then I knew something was up. I said \"well, I'm here now\" I was told they were putting the finishing touches on the cake and that they would be happy to delivery it around 4pm free of charge.  When the cake finally arrived at my house around 445. It looked like buttercream. I asked about refrigeration, one girl said no,I didn't have to refrigerate it, the other said yes I did need to because it was whipped frosting. I pointed out that it did not look like whipped frosting. To late now, I needed a cake. Sure enough, when it came time to serve the cake, it was buttercream. For $55 this cake was not spectacular at all, highly disappointing.  Definately not what I wanted or ordered.  Still wondering what actually happened, I sent a text message to the lady who made the cake and told her that the cake was not all what I ordered and I wanted to know what actually happened since I got 3 different stories. She then proceeded to tell me that she made a cake with whipped frosting and the  colors were beautiful.  When she went to the fridge to check on it later,  all the colors had bled into the frosting and they had to remake the cake. Why couldn't they just be honest and say that in the first place? She apologized a few times then zaid she would be happy to make me another cake free of charge. I agreed,  but I think I would rather have my money back since I drove out there, and was lied to a few times before I finally got the actual story. She offered to make another cake, I would rather have my money back which was never offered. I won't be back and its too bad because she was recommended by a friend who is a caterer."}
{"text":"Love the cupcakes.  Wish they had chocolate croissants tho...  We go at least once or twice a week great people and wonderful staff!    Plus is next-door to fizz so how can you lose?"}
{"text":"I've only ever been there in the afternoons, but I find the ladies there to be a little standoffish and sometimes rude. the guys at the counter always seem helpful. the pb&j and cookies are good (per my coworkers). overall, unless you need a special cake (they're wedding cakes look beautiful), then any place else would be better. not so much talking down to you."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat and would recommend it to health oriented people.  Also, you or anybody you know are thinking of buying a house here in Arizona, then please visit my website for more information on getting qualified for a mortgage! caesarcalderonloans.com  -Thanks, Caesar"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places.  I love the cinnamon roll French toast and the cupcakes."}
{"text":"Wonderful, filling lunch with a surprise mini cupcake at the end. Delicious!  Great customer service."}
{"text":"Always my favorite place for food. The cinnamon rolls are to die for, or if your feeling healthy and want something fresh, their salads are the bomb! Of course there is the sandwiches and soup of the day too. Ask for Sam! Shes my BFF and Sassys VIP!"}
{"text":"A wonderful breakfast place. It's cute and clean. Nice service.  Wonderful waffles with lots of whipped cream and strawberries. The cinnamon French toast was to die for with its ooey gooey center and caramel syrup. The stacked was so good with crispy hasbrows tasted great as did the perfectly cooked bacon cheddar quiche. The crust was flakey and it was creamy. Sooo yummy we'll definitely be back and bring our family!"}
{"text":"Love everything we have eaten here! The sugar cookies are OFF THE CHART good! I was in flavor heaven when I enjoyed the Breakfast Slider last week.... Can't wait to get back there next week. Customer service is so good that you feel like you're at home!"}
{"text":"Came in to get pricing on a cake. The gentleman that I spoke with was friendly, but at 3 in the afternoon, the impression that I got was that I was bothering him. Nevertheless, he gave me the info I went in for and sold me a couple cupcakes.  I noticed a sign on the bakery case stating that the kitchen closes at 3pm. Not sure if this is every day. I guess from 3pm to closing you can only get baked goods.  The cupcakes were excellent. Five stars all the way. Decent price as well.  We will be back for breakfast or lunch one of these days."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time today.  Just came for dessert and found the cupcakes to be divine! Perfectly moist with delicious frosting and filling. I would love to give this place 5 stars if I didn't feel as though we were annoying the girl working at the counter. She's seemed completely put out that we were asking what the cupcakes were, as there were no labels or descriptions posted. Hoping this is a one time occurrence, because I hope to come back and try more food. Sassy should describe the food, not the service... If you just want a yummy cupcake and excellent service, just go next door to Fiiz. Sassy's makes their cupcakes too and you can get a yummy soda concoction--with great friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband and I got married in June, and we went to them for our wedding cake, and cupcakes for our reception. The owner was so pleasant to work with, she made sure we got everything we wanted and more. There prices were great, and they are really on top of things.   This is by far the best cake I have ever had. I would recommend this place for your wedding, any event you are having, or if you just need something sweet to eat!   This place is so great, thank you Melody for making our wedding perfect!"}
{"text":"I ordered a German Chocolate cake for my husbands Bday. What I got was a Chocolate cake with with German Chocolate icing as decoration."}
{"text":"Looked on Yelp to find a place that had breakfast and found Sassy's. We were only a short distance away so gave it a try. I ordered the pancakes and my bride ordered the cinnamon roll French toast. Talk about good! The portion size was humongous and we could have easily shared one meal and still had leftovers. We took the leftovers home and enjoyed another breakfast the next day. Great place for breakfast and or lunch. It sounded like they may be moving to a new location in a short time, but only about a mile or so. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed that's for sure."}
{"text":"We went to sassy's yesterday for lunch and this morning for breakfast. Lunch consisted of tomato soup and a chicken Caesar salad. Very good combination, soup was hot salad was cold excellent lunch. To top it off they placed a mini red velvet cupcake on the side of our plates, it was the best cupcake ever! The frosting was out of this world, so good I brought four full size cupcakes to go. Today's breakfast consist of cinnamon French toast and sassy's hash. Oh how lovely they were. Sassy's is the perfect place for breakfast or lunch, the decor is nice and the whole place is super clean. Maybe a little music in the background might enhance the experience, but overall sassy's is five star place to me!"}
{"text":"Great place!  food is awesome, service is great!  Dazzled me."}
{"text":"First class, well run bakery and cafe.  The pastries, cakes and cookies are all phenomenal.  My wedding cake was just what I wanted and at a reasonable price.  They offer a complimentary tasting session before purchasing your wedding cake.  The chefs have great training and produce delicious products from the fresh ingredients they use.  The ambiance of the cafe fits the name.  It's sassy and fun!  The lemon water was a nice treat on a hot day.  Chicken salad is awesome.  Breakfast portions are generous.  There is a large parking lot, easy access and convenient location.  I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Update with a review on their cake-making skills.  I ordered a cake for my gender reveal party.  It turned out beautifully, tasted amazing, and they were very familiar with the concept of a gender reveal cake.  They were even willing to have it baked and ready for pickup at my requested date - which happened to be over the holidays when the regular restaurant was closed.  The bakers came in special to bake my cake (and a couple other people's cakes too) so I could pick it up on the day of the big reveal."}
{"text":"My 10 year old daughter is a huge fan of the baking challenges on Food Network, when she found out Melanie's bakery was so close to our in-laws, we had to go!  First and foremost, the food is delicious - my daughter had the BLT, and the bread was fantastic.  I had the BBQ chicken quesadilla - nice flavor, not competing flavors.  You get a little red velvet cupcake with your lunch - very cute.  I heard the breakfasts are even better, but we are here during Thanksgiving, so I doubt we will make it.  The staff is awesome!  Melanie came up and spoke with my daughter, and she was definitely star-struck!  Melanie was so nice to her, answering questions and taking pictures.    Great experience all the way around!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to inquire about some bake goods. I was greeted by a very nice boy behind the counter. I think he may be the owners son. He was very knowledgeable and super helpful. I ended up getting a salad while I was there for my son and I. And a very yummy sugar cookie. We sat and ate and chatted with nice young man who had been helping us. I never knew about Sassy's until that day. I would recommend everyone try's one of those yummy sugar cookies."}
{"text":"My daughter and I are in Scottsdale for a meeting when we decided to try Sassy's. It was fantastic! The portions are really big. But the salad and sandwich was great. We decided to try the cupcakes and they are just as amazing!"}
{"text":"Perfect cupcake. Moist cake  Soft, fresh icing. Various flavors. Very good. We will be back ;)"}
{"text":"My husband and I needed a quick place to eat, I pulled this up on yelp. The food was awesome and I had to try a lemon raspberry cupcake, to DIE for. The workers where so nice and helpful about what was their favorite. As this was our first time here. I would come here again."}
{"text":"We had a dessert table for our wedding but I REALLY wanted a banana cake. I ordered a 10 inch round vanilla cake, banana cream filling, and vanilla whipped frosting. It was AMAZING! And absolutely GORGEOUS.  I did not want anything written on it so they covered the top in white chocolate shavings. If I lived closer, this would be my go-to bakery. Highly, Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered a few different cupcakes today and took them home. The service at the counter was great, the boy working was very friendly. The flavor was just okay, you can really taste the shortening in the frosting. I wouldn't suggest these cupcakes over any other cupcake in the valley. Go to Sprinkles instead."}
{"text":"So sad. My first exper ience at sassy's was so over the top good and today is missing so much. There was a group of people in lobby having a hard time figuring out what they wanted. The only help they recieved was the two cashiers stating they could each help them. No assistance with favorites or suggestions. My family finally orders, my daughter is cut off before she finished speaking. RUDE. Our food finally came out and they were just put on the table not explained which sandwhich was which. As it turns out my daughter and I were given the same sandwich (with a spicy sauce) I did not want nor order anything spicy. When I brought it to their attention I recieved a \"oh sorry about that\" Very disappointed."}
{"text":"They recently did a wedding cake for my Dad & Stepmother. It was simple but beautifully done AND was the best wedding cake I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"I love Groupons, has led me to some fabulous places that I never would have found otherwise.  And also some not so fabulous places  This one was the first kind.  Huge fresh salads, wonderful service.  The panini I got was ok, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.   But the cupcakes, oh, the cupcakes.  We got a few different ones, but the one that really stood out was the filled red velvet.  I'm not sure what the filling was, but I dreamed about it last night it was so good.  Gonna take my boss there next week for her birthday too.  That's how great this place was.  Highly highly recommended.  They close at 6pm and are closed on Sundays.  Can't wait to go try something else, but definitely will be getting one of those cupcakes!"}
{"text":"Delicious little gem!! Super duper good chicken sandwich which had soft fresh bread and a generous portion of chicken. My mom said that this place has the best quiche she has ever had!! And she's had plenty quiche in her days! So, naturally, I have to agree with her. The cute little cupcakes that come with your meal is the perfect ending and a clever way to let you sample their home made cupcakes. The cafe itself was very clean and has a nice wide open feeling to it. Impressed."}
{"text":"Love every lunch I have had there. Especially the little cupcakes that come with the sandwiches and salads. All the food is a little special without being over priced. I like to take visitors here - they are always impressed.   Having a dinner party at home ? The cupcakes are a very special dessert. Just the right size and pretty as well as uniquely delicious.   I hate to sound like a commercial for this place, but I love it. Quality food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday, I had the philly cheese steak and I was amazed how good it was. Hubby had 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad. HE could not eat it all and he enjoyed it. The special treat was the tiny red velvet cupcake which left him wanting more. We don't live close so won't travel there very often, but if you live in area, should check it out. My only complaint would be prices. For the philly cheese steak, it was 10.95 and comes with nothing else. His sandwich and salad 11.75. We did not see the prices for bakery items but they did look enticing.  With drinks over $28.00 for lunch, something to think about. They do offer a senior breakfast but no other discounts. Something to think about again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend sent me a cake and breakfast for my birthday. Both were absolutely delicious! Cake is 3 days old and kept in the fridge. It just gets better and better each time I eat another slice!"}
{"text":"Just started eating here a few weeks ago and it's amazing. I work close by and so I have had lunch there 4 times and each time the food is delicious. Order on the phone a head of time make it even easier to pick up and eat lunch on my break. My favorite sandwich is the Sassy Club!"}
{"text":"Amazing bakery in Mesa Arizona!!! I flew in from San Francisco (a city known for superb pastry chefs) and looked on Yelp for the best cinnamon rolls in the area. Sassy's came up as tops on the list. So I just happened to be watching a food network channel and saw Melody as a contestant on a baking championship. I figured it was coincidental karma that I MUST go and check it out. I'm glad I did! We had the cinnamon rolls (amazing!!!!) and also the Molasses Cookie which was to die for. A friend had the quiche and loved it. BUT the dessert that made us all stop in our tracks was the chocolate whoopie pie. OMG wow!!! Dark chocolate cakes) the only type of chocolate you should be using) with the most flavorful frosting filling then dipped in more dark chocolate. It's very rich do we had to share it but WOW! I hope Sassy's goes into franchise and we someday get her up in San Francisco. I can't wait to go back. You should know that you can pre order the cinnamon rolls and bake them fresh at home or take home a whole tray of six. I don't remember seeing that on the website but good to know for the future. And if you're going over the holidays put your order in advance or you may miss out. This place is family owned and operated and although there was some confusion at the front desk (it was very busy) they ultimately figured things out. Love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Why have I not heard of this place before?  I had breakfast. It was filling and yummy the tea was good. I souls try the coffee next time. Oh yes. I will be back. Clean place. Decorated well. Do wish there was pricing on the desserts in the cases I hated to ask on each thing. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"I love this place and cannot wait to get here every year to get in and get my favorites.  When I went in they didn't have macaroons so I asked.  She said they weren't selling so they weren't doing them.  I also wanted a couple chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter mousse inside.  She said they were out but let her check.  She said they had just been put in freezer and would be cold is that ok?  I said sure.  I got several and no mousse inside but a little bit of white creme.  They tasted old!  I also got lemon bars and my friend said they were ok.   I got sugar cookies and they were amazing as always.  I have a group of 20 going for lunch in a few weeks and hoping it will be like normal.  I don't know if I hit a bad day."}
{"text":"Sassy's is AWESOME!! They have made two custom cakes for me, one a beautiful, shimmering sweet 16 and the other a spectacular Spiderman. Both were showpieces and were absolutely adored by the recipient.  I also love to be the hero of any party, just by showing up with their amazing sugar cookies.  When we have stopped in for lunch the food has always been good. One of these days I'm going to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Gotta have the Sassy Sandwich... it was amazing! I had their key lime tart for dessert- again- amazing! This is the kind of place that you'll say, \"Let's come back tomorrow!\""}
{"text":"How have I never heard of this place? It was so tasty. I had the caprese chicken sandwich and it was delicious. It comes with a little red velvet cupcake and it was one of the best cupcakes I've ever had. The service was excellent and the food came out quickly. Great little spot!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I do have a small choice of foods to choose from.  Their baked goods are unbelievable.  I love the atmoshere.  I have taken friends to the restaurant several times and will return today with two more friends."}
{"text":"Super cute little place in an unassuming location.  Well decorated, cute menu...but it sort of went downhill after the first impression.   Fairly disconnected staff, and just watched a women in her 70's bus a table (she is here as a client, not staff)  and wipe it down because every single booth that didn't have guests, was dirty and had dishes on it...all of them.   Lots of staff moving about, but nobody cleaning tables apparently.   I ordered the breakfast burrito and a cup of coffee.  $11.20...OUCH! This is Mesa, where you can't spit without hitting a breakfast burrito place, they certainly think highly of theirs. I will get to that shortly.   For my $11.20, I ordered at a counter, poured my own cup of coffee, got my own hot sauce and had to retrieve my own fork from across the restaurant.   For that same $11.20, I got a good burrito...but not that darn good. A bit on the small size compared to the regular breakfast burritos that are all over the area, good chorizo for sure...but unless that strawberry has $5 rolled up and hidden in it, I won't be back again for the same meal.   The rest of the breakfast menu looked really good, but I was 27 minutes late (breakfast ends at 10:30). I may try it again...but I may not. $11.20...self serve, small burrito....dirty tables....I think for half the price I'll enjoy the massive burrito and dirty tables at one of the many authentic mex joints."}
{"text":"All I can say is yummy breakfast. I had the French toast and it was amazing!   All of the food on others' tables looked really yummy, too! We didn't have any room left for any of their cupcakes or desserts, which were spectacular, but we ordered two cookies to go and ate them later. After eating the cookies, we were disappointed we didn't buy more!   We will definitely be back to try other food and desserts."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here today, but I was very impressed with the food! The BLT and cupcake that I ordered were delicious - in fact, it was hands down the best BLT that I have ever tasted!! I was a little nervous when the word \"avocado\" was misspelled throughout the menu - I wish I wasn't \"one of those\" people, but I am...hahaha. However, the food redeemed the restaurant and I left very happy and full and no longer annoyed by the spelling errors :)"}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches and cupcakes"}
{"text":"My spicy beef sandwich was ok , a little light on the beef slice of cheese  and a lot of bread shredded lettuce and a few slices of tomato . I'm not sure where the spice was. It was served with a yummy red velvet mini cupcake and a strawberry. Price was around 12 bucks .... a bit pricey ........"}
{"text":"This place is  no frills no thrills for me but the chicken caprese sandwich I will have to say is good. Average age when I was here is 70ish. But if your looking for a place that seems easy in/out for lunch , They also serve breakfast untill 1030am ."}
{"text":"2nd visit because the first was so good and wanted to be sure  .... 1st time had the turkey sandwich and loved it. Today had their Chicken Caprese sandwich and was very impressed with it. Great big pieces of chicken and fabulous bread. Also tried the tomato bisque soup which was creamy and very flavorful. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sassy's Cafe is known for its baked goods, but it's cafe eats are not to be overlooked! Went there for lunch and had a Turkey Cranberry Sandwich and cleaned my plate (the mini red velvet cupcake you get with your meal was also a plus!!) The whole family thoroughly LOVED their meals, Sassy's lunch is a must stop in Mesa. Capped off the meal with a moist and chewy Molasses Ginger Snap Cookie - excellent!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on a Saturday morning.  There was a breakfast wedding reception going on so half the sitting area was reserved.  The place is actually bigger than I thought it would be so there was enough sitting for people walking in.  There were about 9 tables available and they were all full when we left.  There was a steady flow of people coming in the entire time.  Some of them were regulars as they knew the owners by name.  The wait staff was really friendly.  We ordered Belgium waffles and a French toast cinnamon roll.   Both were really good. The French toast cinnamon roll didn't need any syrup, it was pretty sweet.  The coffee wad decent, regular coffee.    I would go back for breakfast again.  Would like to try lunch there one day also."}
{"text":"Baked goods are very moist and tasty. The cinnamon rolls are very very good. The staff is very knowledgeable about what is in the baked goods. They are also very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Sassy's  to my friends and family."}
{"text":"We live close by which is a blessing and a curse. Everything is so good here. My go to is the crepes, but we haven't had a bad meal yet. Or course, the cinnamon rolls are scrumptious and huge!  Cupcakes are a treat too."}
{"text":"Bf had the pancakes which were fantastic and I had the turkey avocado sandwich. I asked for it on a croissant and added cream cheese which they did and it turned out great."}
{"text":"I just went for the first time and had the cinnamon bun French toast. This was a true experience. It was not the usual deal where cinnamon bread is used, Sassy's actually bakes a full sized cinnamon bun and slices that to make French toast. It's insane and wonderful. Even the syrup is special. Instead of plain maple syrup, it is some sort of sugar and cinnamon concoction that pairs perfectly. The bacon was also amazing.   The service was spot on and prices were very reasonable for the high quality. It's easy to see where the quality comes from as well. When leaving an in person compliment, the man running sassy's will apologize very nicely for not having time to talk but he is in the back making all the magic that is hitting the tables. 10/10. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I've ever had! Someone told me about the chicken salad sandwich and it's amazing! I've tried almost every other sandwich and I have to say they are all exceptional! Sassy's is not just a place for desserts."}
{"text":"BEST breakfast. Definitely recommend the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I have now tried the food here it was great, I have always came in and bought the to die for sugar cookies! My son came in for Lunch on Friday and were very impressed, great customer service."}
{"text":"They have great baked goods here. Loved everything I have tried. Cookies and cupcakes were unique and delicious. I also get the dipped pretzles."}
{"text":"Shabby Chic meets the dining room.  Think of  a poor man's Sweet Cakes Cafe... complete with the sandwiches, cookies, and the scores of women gathering for the lunch and the latest gossip.  Sandwiches above average but man those cookies are something special.  My dentist thanks you."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food as I have not eaten there. However did try some of the desserts which were good. However, I was looking to purchase a large quantity of desserts and thought they might be able to discount it but they would not. Was a little disappointed as I was hoping to introduce people to this place. It appears to be a little overpriced."}
{"text":"There aren't many things I wouldn't do for a Sassy's cinnamon roll, that being said there are even fewer I wouldn't do for their cinnamon roll French toast.  The folks at Sassy's have created beautiful breakfast harmony...and I thought I knew happiness before that point."}
{"text":"Sassy's is a great family owned bakery that created my beautiful wedding cake masterpiece. Wedding cakes are stressful because you want a beautifully decorated cake, but also one that tastes scrumptious! Most bakers and friends told me I would have to pick ONE of those for a wedding cake because I wanted a 3 tiered fondant cake. Fondant limits the kind of taste you want because whipped cream won't hold up fondant so Sassy's gave us an alternative... top tier REAL cake and the bottom 2 tiers foam covered in fondant; then have a delicious sheet cake on the side to serve to guests. It was brilliant because we still got our cake slicing experience and pictures with a gorgeous cherry blossom cake, but then we got to serve out mouth-watering sheet cake. With the square sheet cake, they let us pick 2 flavors so it was half-n-half. I really recommend Sassy's: they were super friendly, created exactly what I asked for, and were very affordable. They even lent us a beautiful pedestal for the cake to sit on :) I will post a picture of our cake, it was a 3 tier cherry blossom cake."}
{"text":"1st time here... Amazing food and staff. Atmosphere was great. In for a sweet treat if you give it a chance.. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I havnt eaten a meal here but I did buy 4 delicious cupcakes to share with family. 4 differant flavors and all superb. I think they were 2.50 a piece. Definitely crafted by a master baker. The young adults running the front were unprofessional and unfriendly. One girl rung me up and went right to the next customer without saying thank you, goodbye or anything. They wernt even busy.  Awesome cupcakes though."}
{"text":"A couple of our friends took us to this cafe for breakfast. It was amazing! I ordered the Sassy Stacker which was has hash Browns, eggs and sausage. My wife ordered the Cinnamon roll French toast! It was so good it didn't even need syrup, but the syrup made it even better.   The service was great. We didn't have to wait long for our food which was nice. I didn't get to try any of their desserts but I am sure they are amazing. I would recommend getting the Cinnamon roll French toast. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Don't bother making reservations.  The food was good.  The service was slow.  They ran out of tea.  I would not recommend going with a large group."}
{"text":"The Sassy Stacker is delicious for $5.95. The staff was nice. The atmosphere is great. They serve breakfast, lunch and breakfast  items. Located southwest of Lindsey and Main in Mesa. I will come again and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Yum! That frosted cinnamon roll and endless cup of coffee we enjoyed was de-licious! The wait staff was friendly, and the atmosphere open and cheerful. The three salads we ordered to go were each fresh and delicious. My sassy cousin and I will return!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for a brunch time breakfast.  You order at the counter and then sit down.  They bring your food out to you.  I had the cinnamon roll french toast and my wife had the crepes with a side of potatoes.  Both were delicious.  It was tough finishing both because they are both on the rich side but the taste was great.    The only reasons I'm downgrading this to a 3 star experience...staff attitude and utensils/condiments.  The staff wasn't rude but no one was friendly either.  It was just  blah type attitude.  This probably would've made the experience a lot better.  When you go to a small mom and pop type restaurant you sort of expect them to be friendly and treat you differently than a chain.  We didn't get that here at all.  The second thing was the utensils and condiments.  The utensils were plastic which seemed odd and wasteful.  There was a single station for getting the utensils and napkins.  The condiments were two bottles of hot sauce and that was it.  We had to ask for ketchup for the potatoes which came in a small little cup.  The place has a decent amount of seating so it just seemed an odd choice for the setup.    I will most likely be back for some of the bakery items.  I'm not sure I'll be back to sit down and eat again.  This place may do great business.  I'm really don't know but I would guess they would do a lot better with a couple of small changes."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. We came here in a pinch with a cake that we had bought somewhere else that didn't look anything like we ordered. Geoff was super friendly and fixed our cake for us in just a few minutes. We will definitely be ordering our cakes from here from now on."}
{"text":"Picked up cupcakes. Expected a decent product for the price and they were really not worth it. Have had the best I guess in Edmonton Alberta from Flirt Cupcakes!"}
{"text":"This spot is our favorite. Everything is so good, customer service is fabulous amd all the sweets are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time the other day and are quite impressed. The Philly cheese steak was delicious and the homemade Oreos were amazing, creamy and rich. The atmosphere is warm and friendly. We'll definitely be back!  Update: We did come back to try the cinnamon rolls which were hot from the oven. They were flavorful and gooey with yummy frosting."}
{"text":"They made a very special rosette cake for my son's 18th birthday. It was colorful, beautiful and super fresh! We were so pleased and he was so surprised it made the party that night so memorable I will definitely order more cakes from your bakery in the future thank you for listening to my request and building the perfect cake for my son!"}
{"text":"I stopped by recently to pick up some sugar cookies for my co-workers. I had friends bring me cookies before, so this was my first time here in person. I had no idea that this place had breakfast and lunch too. The dishes look pretty good, so I will have to come back and try some of them. As for the cookies, my co-workers were very happy. So much for everyone being on a diet. ;)"}
{"text":"WAY overpriced. I ordered the mozzarella, pesto, tomato, basil sandwich. For $10, it should come with at least one side. For a sandwich like this, it should be priced at $5-6 including a side. Taste wasn't that great either. Salads were $11-ish. Why??? Again, way overpriced. Salad was OK but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Sassy's Cafe and Bakery is a diamond in the rough. On the outside it looks like a small establishment, however step thru the door and you realize you have ventured into the wondrous sites and smells of a delicious bakery. A quick glance will show you they serve breakfast and lunch as well. This is a top notch bakery. The glass case is filled with delicious treats of every kind imagined. Not only do these treats look good they taste every better.  Customer service snd help go beyond the normal and Melody will do anything to make sure your visit was a good one. The decor is very pleasing and makes you feel like you stepped back into time. A time when life was simple and carefree. Where kids could have cookies and moms could  enjoy a cup of tea or coffees and some good conversation.  Sassy's cafe and Bakery is a must stop to have a true small town experience of fun, great food and memories that could last a lifetime"}
{"text":"Great food and service!! Hot cakes are the best in town!"}
{"text":"They have room up at the counter for another cash register. It might be a good investment for them. Came here on a Saturday afternoon and waited10 minutes behind only 2 people. Third person back must have stood  20 minutes. Another thing they could do, is have paper menus to look at while standing in line. Then people can fill out an order slip and drop it off at the cashier.  Half sandwich and soup combo was $9.25. Fresh strawberry on the styrofoam plate, is a nice touch. Would have been better if it was washed.   Chicken caprese sandwich, turkey cranberry sandwich, and \"one bite\" cupcake are delicious.  Broccoli cheese soup is very creamy but to spicy for me. Whole, Fresh ingredients. Won't find any processed, mystery meat here!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten-free birthday cake from here and it was outstanding.  I look forward to going there soon."}
{"text":"I actually really love the food here but I find their portions for the price to be on the high side, especially for a self service cafe. I work close by and splurge here for lunch every once in a while and like I said, ALL the food and desserts I have tried are delicious. Just know it aint cheap. And portions are small. A roast beef sandwich has about 2 slices of roast beef and lots of lettuce filler. I also don't find their service to be all that friendly and I've noticed that their comments to any negative review on here are defensive, which in my opinion is not the way to go about business. People are entitled to their opinions the same way you're entitled to run your business the way you see fit. If the food weren't so good I'd probably stop coming but they do make a good sandwich & salad, so I'm torn."}
{"text":"2 words: sugar cookies. They are unbelievably delicious and addicting. Everything here is great. Of course the cookies and cupcakes are my favorite but their salads and sandwiches are also yummy- the spicy beef sandwich and strawberry salad are my favorites. The only bad thing about this place is it can sometimes take a long time to order if it's busy- they only have 1 register. Honestly though it's worth the wait :)   My mom also had a custom large sized sugar cookie ordered for my birthday which was cooked perfectly. She also ordered my graduation cake from there, it was chocolate with white chocolate mousse filling. My family and friends all agreed it was one of the best cakes they've eaten!! I really love this place and it's my number 1 stop for a sweet treat even though it's 20 minutes from my house!"}
{"text":"Went in with a bunch of people for lunch. What a rip off, I ordered a $10 Turkey sandwich with cranberry. I got ONE little piece of meat on the sandwich.  Will never go back. Total Rip Off."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter which bakery item you desire, they are always best tasting.  My only regret today is only buying one cookie!"}
{"text":"This is the second winter my wife and I have been in the Mesa area. Sassy's in one of our favorites. We love the cinnamon roll french toast! If you want your sweet fix, that's the stuff to get. Staff very friendly and helpful. Oh yea, great freshly baked bakery treats!"}
{"text":"Decided to try some place new for my daughter's birthday. We love their cookies. so the cakes must be great plus they offered filling for smaller cakes. I don't know how what I ordered got lost in the translation. I wanted maroon and gold flowers on top of the cake. I got swirls. Ordered peanutbutter cup filling. The filling barely tasted like peanutbutter. And the person I ordered from said they would put some peanutbutter cups on top of the cake. NONE. To top it off the cake was too high for the box. The girl boxing it put the lid down and I didn't realize until I got home and was ready to deliver it to ASU that the frosting was now squished swirls on top. I would have driven back but live on the border of Chandler/Mesa. The cake tasted great and was really moist, but was disappointed in the presentation and not the way I ordered. I left a message on FB but was never replied to back in October. Oh well."}
{"text":"I popped into this bakery spur of the moment to pick up some cupcakes for a last minute dinner party... key lime pie, chocolate mocha, vanilla cream, oreo, chocolate cheesecake and pretzel caramel.  I literally tried a bite of everyone cupcake and not one tasted fresh! The flavor was totally subpar.  The icing on all of the cupcakes tasted like a fake whip cream that was very stale.  The kinda stale taste you get from having an unwrapped item sitting in the fridge too long! The texture of the cake on all of the cupcakes was strange, kinda chewy, not sure if that is the right term but they were not good.  My biggest complaint is the staleness of the cupcakes!  If you are going to have a bakery, the baked goods should be baked everyday, no day old of several day old should be served!    The decor was cute inside but did not match the tacky look of the outside of the building.  There is glass paint all over the windows, odd for a bakery/cafe.  They were busy with people standing in line for lunch items and the workers were not at all friendly! It was a real bummer of an experience!"}
{"text":"I visited Sassy's for the first time yesterday. It was the bright spot of my day! I had a wonderful red velvet cupcake with fresh, yummy frosting and a cup of coffee. As soon as we sat down, the attentive staff offered us fresh coffee (twice). Looking around at everyone's salads and sandwiches I almost wish I'd eaten lunch there. I'd say, give Sassy's a shot. I walked away a happier woman."}
{"text":"Sassy's is a great place to pick up a salad to bring home. I usually order the BBQ chicken salad, but also enjoy the Mixed Berry salad as well. I really appreciate that Sassy's offers them as either a full or a half salad option.  I have one pet peeve that they could easily fix...Sassy's includes a mini red velvet cupcake with all orders. (A nice touch) For some unknown reason, they place the cupcake inside your to go salad order. This means that the frosting gets cheese, lettuce, corn etc. stuck in it. If I could remember, I'd ask for it on the side, but why they just can't do that to begin with, I don't know.   Other than my mini-rant, I enjoy the salads at Sassy's!!"}
{"text":"Got my grandson a basketball jersey cake and it looked and tasted like purfection also your lunches are delicious thos place has some talented bakers"}
{"text":"First time in, had early lunch.  Turkey cranberry sandwich is delicious.  Service was great. Beat lunchtime rush.  Music was a bit sleepy."}
{"text":"Sassy's completely nailed the cupcake order for my baby shower! Everything was perfect, and ready right on time! When ordering they didn't hesitate to inform me that some of my original ideas and flavor combinations probably wouldn't work so well. We made changes where necessary, and the cupcakes were a hit/ The whole process was seamless, and now I know where to recommend others when in need of an awesome bakery!"}
{"text":"Ate the chicken salad on croissant and it was excellent, crisp and fresh. Very happy. Didn't care for the ice tea."}
{"text":"Dropped in with two of my co workers to try out a lunch. I heard some good things about Sassy's and the chicken salad sandwich was a top pick. Upon arrival I was greeted with fast service and a huge chicken salad sandwich. What I found unique was the almond slices all over the freshly made salad mix. All the toppings were on the side and they did not go cheap with the quantity of toppings. Half a tomato and a grip of lettuce.  I did not need any chips as the sandwich was more than filling. There is plenty space inside and lots of tables. Very clean inside and decor is very girly. I'm sure all the ladies love the decor. I got to take my wife! Next time I'm going for the breakfast!!"}
{"text":"I used Sassy's for a last minute work related event and boy did they amaze me! I called them at 2pm the day before the event and asked for 200 bite sized brownies. I was not picky about what kind they were so they gave me some wonderful suggestions.  I picked up the brownies at 9am the next morning and everything looked perfect! During the event I had many people ask where I got the delicious brownies from! I should have grabbed some business cards to help promote them! My event went so smooth because of the help from Sassy's! I highly encourage everyone to use Sassy's for your next event or just stop in to grab a quick bite from their bakery!"}
{"text":"I went into this location yesterday a purchase a few sweet treats to go. I'm not going to give 5 stars being I do feel the customer service needs a bit of work. It was not clear on how to read their cupcake menu which also should be a little clearer. The cookies icing is awesome  but cookie itself was not so good. As for the cupcakes...those babies are spot on and I was looking for more. They have the perfect balance of icing to cake to filling! I can say it is pricey but well worth it for the cupcakes!  I had a butter fingers, raspberry, strawberry, and vanilla"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous little gem that we just love to go to.  Breakfast items are above awesome and no one in town can cook hash browns like they can. They know just how to get the centers warm and soft and the outside brown and crispy.  They have also had a Senior's Special which was delicious for $5.99.  Not sure if this is on going or not. They also offer great combos for lunch.  Lots of places let you do a house salad and soup or sandwich, but Sassys let you choose your salad from any of their fabulous selections. Just wish they were open Sundays!"}
{"text":"Best, freshest food ever! You will not be disappointed. Nuff said. Oh, except try the red velvet cupcakes, and the pina colada french toast, and the crepes, and the ham & swiss, and the creamy potato soup, and everything else on their menu. They do wedding cakes & catering, too."}
{"text":"I have been trying to place an order for their signature cinnamon roll mix in their \"Sassy's Bakery\" bags for over a month. This was supposed to be a birthday gift first, then after they didn't have it in time I was going to make it a mother's day gift. Each time they tell me it's on back order. I don't think the owner ever placed the order. I keep being told I will receive a call back and I get nothing. The first time I called to order they said it would be available the next day. I went to pick it up and they didn't even know my order existed. I placed the order again, I was told that it would be ready the next day, again. Called them to verify the next day and they said they had no knowledge of my order and it would be impossible for me to order this from them as they were out of the bags. They didn't even bother to call me and tell me this! I placed another order and was told it would take 2 weeks. 3 weeks later I call after not hearing anything from them and it's still on backorder!! I would not trust ordering anything from them, especially a wedding cake if they can't even get a cinnamon roll mix order right. They don't even have the courtesy to call their customers. Beware if you have a deadline for an order because you won't get it! Thanks for ruining a birthday & mother's day, Sassy's! I will not be back with the service I have been given."}
{"text":"FROSTING WAS SHOCKING. Shocking because I did not expect it to be the most amazing (buttercream?) frosting I have ever had. This was the frosting on the spice cupcake. Also bought a peppermint whoopie pie. It was amazing; not just because chocolate and peppermint, but because of how soft the frosting filling was, how chewy and perfect the cookies were, and how non-hard the chocolate it was dipped in was. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars was because the coffee sucked. But seriously awesome baked things"}
{"text":"My daughter recently got married and I used Sassy's for her salads and desserts.  Nothing but great things to say about this company! They delivered everything fresh and on time. All of the wedding guests complimented the deliciousness of the desserts.  The salads weren't only yummy but were beautifully prepared and presented. If you are looking for a company to do your catering, I highly recommend Sassy's! Thanks for helping to make my daughter and son in laws day fantastic!"}
{"text":"Found our new favorite breakfast spot! Love their Belgian waffles (especially the syrup)! We usually end up buying something extra to take home for Sunday since they aren't open.  Staff is great as well!"}
{"text":"The chicken salad sandwich was delightful great Just the right amount of  dressing  We split  we each got a cupcake for an up charge  the wait staff should have explained that so you can decide if you want that We visited with the owner they know what they ate doing  This is the place to come for a light meal and sweet treats  The counter is full of wonderful goodies We will be back"}
{"text":"Who would of thought this cafe/bakery would have the best breakfast we've EVER had. My husband had been raving about the sandwiches and their cupcakes for a while. He said we should go and try breakfast there. Oh man I'm so glad we did! The cinnamon roll french toast and pancakes with a caramel like syrup are unforgettable! The over hard eggs which typically are never made right were made perfectly and looked beautiful! I don't know how they cooked these eggs but I need to watch and learn. Lastly the portions are large and great for the price! The owners pretty awesome too! A very sweet family owned business!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to see the owner on the Food Network Holiday Baking Champion Challenge and NEEDED to taste some of her creations. Small restaurant where you order at the counter and get your own drinks while they prepare and then serve your order.  We work overnight so we're always at restaurants for breakfast time. Menu is limited for me, I don't like eggs and like most places they're on everything. I wish they served their sandwiches all day.  Husband has enjoyed all of the different things he has ordered (he loves eggs).  The star for me are her baked goods! Cannolis I would Tanya Harding someone for! Everything we have tried has been delicious. I recommend  Sassy's to everyone I know and those who have gone have loved it. Yum! Now I'm wanting a cannoli!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Sassy's for custom cakes. The Thursday before a Saturday wedding, as a groomsman I was tasked with finding a cake (procrastinators, I know). We found Sassy's here on yelp and called to make the order. They were super helpful in walking us through the flavors (of which there are many) and getting us lined up with a delicious cake worthy of our friends' big day. Despite the short notice, the cake was ready and waiting for us at the appointed pickup time, giving us plenty of time before the reception. We had some of our own flourishes to add to the cake, so the kind souls at Sassy's gave us some extra icing to make it easy to adhere the decorations once we got to the venue. All the way around, the process was simple and painless, and the cake delicious.   P.S. we couldn't resist a cinnamon roll and snickers cupcake while we picked up the cake. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Cutest little place tucked away in a shopping center, but totally worth the stop! The bakery items look amazing and the menu is perfect... Both lunch and breakfast available! I got the turkey avocado. And friends got the turkey cranberry! It's about big enough to share!! Comes with the cutest little red velvet cupcake."}
{"text":"Used them for a gender reveal party.  The cupcakes were fun and delicious,  and I dare you to find better cake pops."}
{"text":"Found this place just off yelp, as it was conveniently located near a rehearsal space.  What a fabulous find!  The bread was so soft, the food all delicious, and the cupcakes fabulous!"}
{"text":"Sassys made our wedding cake. Their cake is AMAZING! I would give their cake 5 stars. But their customer service is poor at best. Every time we come in or call, they seem inconvenienced and rushed."}
{"text":"I had the club sandwich and it was delightful! I don't know what was so different about it from other sandwiches like this but IT WAS AMAZING. I would totally come here again. I also really liked that they gave you a cute little red velvet cupcake on the side. Such a fun shop!"}
{"text":"So we have been here on multiple occasions but only to pick up bundt cakes that have been out of this world good!  But today we had brkfst, me and the kiddos.  Absolutely delicious!  Brkfst sandwich was awesome, daughter had French toast that was probably a little on the sweet side, ahhh who cares ;)!  Son loved the pancakes, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I thought I've already left a review but it looks like I haven't. I love Sassy Cakes before they moved it was that a closer location to my wedding venue and they made the cupcakes for my wedding. they delivered on time, had a great price, and still my favorite cupcakes I've ever come across. I wish they want to move further out it's not as easy for me to get there now during the week but it's still worth trying if you have a chance. I recommend the BLT also..."}
{"text":"I visited Sassy's cafe for the first time and ordered the chicken salad sandwich. It was heavenly. The sandwich was fresh and flavorful. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Traveling seniors'  Found this little cafe near our motel! For breafeast me mister healthy oatmeal!  Great with all of the fixings, her eggs and toast,  Bacon ! Well something went Real wrong with my wife plate she had to send it back, and no more food! The server comped our meal, a real class act! Will be back! A great selection  Of  delicious pastries! By the way the  establishment is very clean!"}
{"text":"Have used this location for so many different things - it's hard to remember them all - ranging from work: -Tri-level cake/cupcakes with custom prints as well as creative industry specific creations -Catered events with setup as well as them lending display items for serving (delivered and setup by the owners themselves) -Ongoing client lunches (like today - always a great option)  to personal: -Baby shower for my daughter - tri-level cake and cupcakes decorated perfectly in the same theme/colors as the shower/invitations/etc.etc.  -Also provided catering for this event with setup and referred a person for us to use for setup/serving/drinks throughout - was PERFECT -Daughter's first birthday - tri-level Elmo cake - also perfectly done (worked with both of the owners on these two separate events personally - always accessible and both go above/beyond to make your event/needs feel like their number one priority) -occasional needs - holidays/special occasions/etc. etc.  I couldn't be any more happy with what this company has done for me and can't believe I didn't find them sooner than I did.  Even living 35-40 mins from their location, I still continue to use them despite the drive because of preference and ongoing service and reliability - not to mention the personal touch/availability.  Wish every experience with a company could be like this - oh, and did I mention that the food/baked goods are amazing.....?  May have forgot to mention that along the way, but believe me when I say - you'll appreciate the find/experience from start to finish.  Thanks for everything guys - you'll see my admin team again today, and we'll continue to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Once again Sassy's went above and beyond I LOVE their cakes cupcakes and customer service. Melody was SO nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey sandwich with cranberry aioli and it was delicious. All of the sandwiches come with a strawberry and a little red velvet cupcake, which was to die for & made me wish I had 5 more. A coworker also got us some of their frosted sugar cookies and they were the best I've ever had. Would have given 5 stars but I think they are a little overpriced. That being said, I will still go back and try other sandwiches and definitely other baked goods."}
{"text":"Today is National sandwich day instead of going with subway or like jimmy John's I decided to go with sassy's trust me that was the best choice I could have made for the day I had the sassy club everything about it was correct from the butter toasted bread to the meats&to top it off with the honey mayo sauce I would highly recommend this place I'm pretty sure you will love it as much as I do"}
{"text":"Definitely the best cafe I have ever been to, and I travel to cafe's for a living. Way better then sweet cakes cafe"}
{"text":"Needed a last minute special birthday request of buttermilk pie and Sassy's came through.  It was a bit different then some others we've had, but still delish!  I called 3 pie shops in the East Valley and none of them could make buttermilk pie.  Thanks so much!!  It was a hit!"}
{"text":"ok, when I first walked in I thought it was a cute place.  then there was only one line open so it took forever to order lunch.  I asked the lady for lemon water but she just told me where the cups for water were.  and No, there were no lemons there.   I ordered the Caprese Chicken sandwich which I asked the cashier to describe to me.  It sounded like something I would like.  Well she told me that there was a balsamic glaze on it and my mouth was watering.  Geeze was I wrong.  there was a mayonnaise type sauce on it, not a balsamic glaze and this was not a true Caprese.  I know cause I use to make them in California.  it was awful.  I ate the sandwich cause I was being treated for it and when we got to the car I asked him how his lunch was and he said not so good.  and to top it off, within 10 minutes I was so sick I had to go to a bathroom at an antique mall cause of the way this sandwich effected me.  ahem.  Worse ever.  A true Caprese has balsamic,  not a mayonnaise type sauce.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Even the tart I brought home was watery.  YUCKY"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was lacking. All the tables were dirty, people were having to bus tables to sit down. Then I watched as a bus boy came out, grabbed a few dishes and didn't wipe the table, he didn't come back to take care of it either. I wasn't given my full order, I attempted several times before I was actually able to get someone's attention (having a two year old with me I couldn't just leave my child at the table). They need to figure out a better way to take care of the dining room. I had been looking forward to trying this place for a long time and I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered cupcakes from Sassy's through EZ-Cater for a work event and I had the best experience! Sassy's brought the most delicious cakes AND they looked fantastic! People from work were raving about the quality and look of the cupcakes and I agree, fantastic service and fantastic taste! I will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Been going to Sassys every week for years...it has NEVER disappointed! Every single salad is cold, crisp and delicious. The soups flavorful and hearty, the sandwiches  are clever combinations of fresh, well prepared ingredients. And the desserts, oh the desserts! Cupcakes! Cookies! The BEST sugar cookies! The individual chocolate torte is to die for! It's pure heaven when you walk in to fresh cinnamon rolls being pulled from the oven! Literally, every week I go. It's THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"I stopped by with a Groupon and had the bbq pork sandwich.  It was a meager lunch for the price.  Most places will give you some kind of  side (chips, potato salad, etc.) with the sandwich.  All we got was the sandwich and a strawberry and mini cupcake for almost $8.  Glad I didn't have to pay the full price.  The only way I will come back is with a Groupon type deal."}
{"text":"It's never a good sign when a restaurant also hawks wrinkle creams. Doesn't mean the food won't taste OK; it just means that the owners and staff are distracted from the enterprise of excelling at the primary focus of serving good food in the most pleasant way possible. They're not professionals.  Another bad sign was the fact that beverages were served in styrofoam cups. Not even paper, unless you order coffee--no, Sassy's uses the cheapest, most environmentally damaging, most carcinogenic substance possible to drink out of. And they have no recycling options in the whole store.  And the coffee is just awful, so bad you have to wonder if the people who brew it ever taste it.  Sassy's stops serving breakfast at 10:30, so I was glad we arrived at 10:10, with plenty of time to order. Even though ours was the only order being prepared, it took a fully 20 minutes for us to get our food.  Waffles and French toast are not especially labor-intensive meals--which I'm sure is one reason Sassy's offers them.  The kid behind the counter spent more time hugging family members who had come in for a discount meal and other staff members than doing anything to help customers he wasn't on a first-name basis with.  When our order arrived, it was served on more styrofoam. Guys, buy a dishwasher and some decent plates, glasses, and flatware!  It's more cost effective in the long run--and it's a much more pleasant experience for your patrons.  My French toast was tasty enough, but I expect more from restaurants I frequent: I want them to show respect for customers and for the resources and practices that create a sustainable business model. Sending so much material to a landfill every bleeding day is not sustainable.   In short, Sassy's serves palatable food, but it's a shitty business"}
{"text":"New location, but same great food! Food is always fresh and the staff is always friendly. Best cinnamon roles around. Period. I refuse to eat anyone else's cinnamon roles. Give this place a try for breakfast, lunch or to cater your next event or party. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and pastries in town. I have tried most of the food here and it is all good! I just had the breakfast stacker with a fried egg on top... I'm very happy right now! Oh, and the cinnamon rolls are the best I have ever had. My kids love the pancakes and of course the sugar cookies. I could go on and on... Just stop by and give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good.  Pepsi products.  Known for cakes and deserts.  Groups welcomed with reservations.  Strip center parking.  Good service.  Order as you enter but get your table!"}
{"text":"Wanted to grab some cupcakes for a family members birthday and noticed that Sassy's had a little more variety than other places around. They did not disappoint. Stopped in for the cupcakes, stayed for bacon, eggs and toast (with purchased cupcakes awaiting me in the cooler) They were a big hit!"}
{"text":"I was craving cupcakes and did a search here on yelp. Sassy's seemed close and per their menu/advertisement cupcakes were 1.50 or 2.00. I called got the assortment of flavors for the day and thought I'd give them a try. The staff was very polite but immediately when a \"regular\" came in, I was rushed to get out so they could help him. I realize small businesses thrive on their regulars but if you don't make new ones feel welcomed, dot expect your business to grow. Then when I asked for price clarification I was told that all the cupcakes were 2.50 because they were filled and how much work went into them.... Really? I looked at their menu and supposedly they were to have different price points. Due to my cravings I did buy some since I had driven all the way there. They also have frosted sugar cookies that were very good. I highly recommend those. I've tried two of the cupcakes so far and the lemon drop far outweighs the vanilla cream.... I wouldn't say don't go to this place but be prepared to pay small business prices and if your not a regular you may not be a priority... Lastly, the decor was pink, reminded me of candy land but service is far more important to me than decor anyways... They do serve breakfast and lunch and from what I saw going out it looked decent but if have to eat it to review."}
{"text":"What a nice little bakery;).  I had cinnamon roll French toast.  I was also very pleased that when I went there to have a mom and daughter time but was there after close the owner let us come in and get our cupcakes to go.   That was awesome service in my book.    Can't believe that I have lived near by for over 2 years and never gone in.   We now have a new place for little treat."}
{"text":"Ordered another cake, this time for our daughter's 21st birthday!  Not only was the cake absolutely delicious, they picked the most perfect color blue and made the cake beautiful with a chocolate 21 on top!  Quite a jaunt to come down to pick up a cake here, but so worth it!  We also had their delicious cinnamon rolls while there too- also amazing!!  Thank you Sassy's!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be more happy with the amazing wedding Sassy's Cafe and Catering did for us and 30 guests we invited! We didn't even have a venue and Melody Larsen and her Husband Geoff said \"let's have it here at the restaurant. I picked up bulk flowers just as she suggested and dropped them off the day before the wedding. I was totally amazed as where all my guests that arrived the day of our wedding. They totally transformed the place with beautiful candlelight tables,floral displays, as well as beautifully set tables. Each place setting was set with a beautiful rosette frosted sugar cookie which is her signature and my personal favorite! But if that wasn't enough the food was beyond amazing. The dinner was a delicious spinach berry salad followed by a cashew crusted chicken cutlet with a apricot glaze, green beans almandine and their other signature stuffed potatoes!  She made a beautiful rosette covered cake and instead of just serving cake for dessert she set up an elegant dessert bar with cannolis, eclairs and gourmet brownies and cupcakes. I highly recommend Melody and Geoff owners of Sassy's Cafe for any special event you are planning. Their prices are unbeatable for what they did for us. So do yourself a favor and check them out!"}
{"text":"Sassy's cafe made bride and groom pretzel rod's for our wedding last week. They were soooo amazing! Not only did I think they were good, but I had tons and tons of guests come and tell me how awesome they were too. I will be using them for all my bakery needs and would 100% refer my friends and family also. Customer service was amazing! You don't feel like a customer when you walk in there... you feel like a friend."}
{"text":"Love this caf√©.  I wish they had molasses cookies every day and not just as seasonal which the cashier told me today.  I was very disappointed.  Also noticed they are using less frosting on the sugar cookies than they did when they first opened.  Other than that, great place."}
{"text":"Thanks for another great breakfast at Sassy's!!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Not great for breakfast. Servings are skimpy and expensive. No table service. Order at the cash register. We ordered the Sr breakfast. Price was good but eggs were over cooked, bacon was skimpy and toast was not buttered. Also ordered the Belgian waffle. One waffle with no sides or meat for 9.50. Not a good value."}
{"text":"Sassy's was great! The owner is a DREAM to work with; she is so sweet!!!  Her girls working the front were really nice to me the day I paid in full, which I just laughed off.  Her cakes are AMAZING though, and my wedding cake was beautiful and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Snuck in for an iced cinnamon roll & coffee as a first timer. Wow is how I describe the roll. Returned for lunch with the wife & was wow'ed all over again. The cream of chicken soup was superb. Lots of chicken & noodles in a light cream liquid broth served with bread & the signature strawberry and cupcake. The BBQ chicken quesadilla was as flavorful & was full of chicken, black beans, & corn. The owner explained his menu & told me about the scratch biscuits and gravy served on Saturdays.  Guess when I'm coming back?"}
{"text":"Oh my gawd best sugar cookies on the planet! Stopped in today to see what the pastry case looked like as far as gluten free on hand baked goods and did not leave disappointed.   Because I am GF by choice not necessity i have the pleasure of occasionally tasting a past worlds flavors of love aka Gluten..   So to my disappointment there was not a labeled or displayed GF sweet treat to indulge in for myself (so GF must havers can stop here- but consider this fair advice for gluten lovers in your life). I decided to snag a beautifully colored sugar cookie in the case for my daughter before we left, purple to be specific (must be the color of heaven). Now my little princess is two, so she only got a tiny morsel of this sweet goodness but heaven it was.   Never had a better, softer, fluffier (if that's a word) sweet, almost salty (weird I know, maybe that was the crack, jk) buttery cookie in my life.. Heaven. Nom nom nom. If they could make me a GF version I would be massive and loving every bit of it."}
{"text":"Sassy's had quality home style cooked food with a comfortable atmosphere that really made me feel like I was in someone's home and not a business. Over the course of a week I had a Stacker, Slider and the Cinnamon French Toast and enjoyed a snickerdoodle cookie as well. The strawberry at the end of each meal was a nice touch as well.  It got even better when I met the owners, Mel and Geoff, who treated me like I was family.   I will always stop by Sassy's when I visit Arizona!"}
