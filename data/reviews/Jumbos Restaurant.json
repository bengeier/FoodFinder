{"text":"Very expensive for one of the worst club sandwiches I've ever eaten. I would recommend eating almost anywhere else before eating here. With all that said the staff was fairly friendly."}
{"text":"Ate there and was not impressed. Very expensive compared to other fast good places, and quality of food isn't there. Decor feels like a work cafeteria.

Wil never recommend and 
Will never go back too"}
{"text":"Don't let the other reviews discourage you from eating here. 

It wasn't my favourite restaurant at all, but the food was good enough, although it was pretty expensive for the quality. The decor isn't wonderful, but it's because it's a spot for truckers to stop (hence the massive parking lot and the location). They have lots of options in food and serve breakfast as well as lunch/dinner. 
I had breakfast here and actually really enjoyed the hash browns and beans, and the eggs were big! The bacon was burnt black.

I have mixed feelings about this spot, but I would give it another chance if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Don't let the negative reviews sway you. This place is exactly what it's trying to be. A nice comfort food spot with great sandwiches and fries, very friendly staff, and a bright and cleanly updated dining area. 

We ate here during a visit to Centre DMV with our pup, while waiting for some tests, and it was exactly what we needed. The supreme club and fries were great, and the poutine was amazing. Lots of variety on the menu, and we'll definitely be back next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this is rated poorly? Fries, good, poutine, good, sammich, good. Staff were friendly and accommodating. For what it is, a greasy spoon, it's good!"}
