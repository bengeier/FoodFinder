{"text":"Idk what this Christopher m's issue is. I was there the same week he was. Michael(the man responsible for making all the food) was out of town with his fiancé(who does most of the wrapping) so the business was short staffed with two of their most important parts. I go there at least three times a week with at least five co workers. Our lunch break always falls in the middle of their busy hours. The food there is so good they have a line out the door everyday. But we have never waited more than twenty mins for our food. And twenty is pretty good compared to a chipotle or a panera. The only difference, the food here is outstanding. If I could, I'd eat here every day of my life. I love it."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and wraps are very delicious. It's a decent portion size, too, and leaves you feeling full and happy. Due to their short hours, however, I can only ever come here during lunch time over the work week, which tends to be difficult. However, I'm never disappointed!  Today, I decided to try their Sicilian pizza with added basil. It was very good. It comes as 4 slices or 8 slices (whole pizza), so I got 4. It was very fulfilling, so I get to save 2 slices for lunch tomorrow (yay!) Note: I am not shy about eating more than I can handle, so this is no small feat!  The style is thicker crust with good amounts of cheese but cooked very well, with good flavors.  Adding on toppings does tend to get a bit pricey, but the homey, Italian feel of this place makes me forgive easily. Also, the staff/owners are wonderful and kind.  I personally prefer their wraps but I was pretty happy with my pizza.  I stole a bite of my husband's Buffalo chicken wrap, which was delicious, too.  Not surprisingly, many people come here to grab lunch. It's located near Heinen's but definitely stands out on its own.  I would easily say this is one of my favorite sandwich cafes. Now, if only they could be open on the weekends!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were amazing!  The game changer is a game changer and the mafiata had to be defended from my kids eating all of it! Very friendly service!! We will be back, oh yes we will be back!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Ethan's Green and stopped here for a sub many a time. Recently I was visited Twinsburg and had a chance to return.  The subs are still next-level - significantly better than any chain e.g. Jersey Mikes, Firehouse Subs, etc.  The Italian and Club are both phenomenal. The buns are always toasted perfectly.  The veggie sub is a standout. It's probably the only place I go and the thought of a veggie sub makes my mouth water. Try it out.  In addition, portions are also nicely sized (full meal for me, two for my wife)."}
{"text":"Best things about this place -Locally owned business (YES!) -Fun owners who care about their food and customers -High quality ingredients with killer combinations -Reasonable pricing so you can be a regular without breaking the bank :)  This place has been around like 13 years and I haven't had it since HS. I don't work in the area and they always seemed to be open hours I wasn't able to go (lunch). Well....FOOD LOVERS REJOICE!!! They are opened extended hours for dinner now! This community has needed fresh quality easy to grab take out food for as long as I've lived here and they have answered our prayers.   I went in on their second night open for dinner because I saw them post about a special of pulled pork and homemade mac & cheese...they had me enticed already. It did not disappoint, the croutons and added cheese on the mac made it exceptional, the pulled pork was a very generous portion and had the meltiest cheese. I'm still dreaming about this meal-its the best one I've had in a while, and you guys know how much I eat out, so that means a lot lol  Can't wait to continue checking this place out and trying more things on the menu. I remember their tuna being killer and pizza looks delish too. I'll keep you all posted! YUM!"}
{"text":"I have been shopping at the Heinens right next to this place for 15 years and I never even thought of stopping in and trying this place until today and I'm not sure why!!!!  Maybe it's because from the outside it doesn't really look like much and kind of blends in with the businesses around it.  I was even a little apprehensive to walk in not knowing what to expect! Was this really a cafe!?    Well by George it is!! A nice cozy feel.  About 10 or so 4 top tables.  Grab a paper menu and a seat, figure out what you want, and order/pay at the register.  They'll bring your food out to you.  Which by the way was rather quick!   We had a cup of their chicken tortilla soup, and it was delicious!  I was wishing I had a larger size by the last spoonful.  I also had the summer turkey sandwich.  Everything was perfect!  Not to bready not to sweet, just a perfect blend of flavors!   My hubby got the game changer sandwich which hold on to your pants folks, it's a meatball and Italian sub combined!! Yes, it was delicious!   We can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu and the dinner items on thu. Fri. Or sat. Evening!!   Kicking myself that I never tried it sooner!!!"}
{"text":"Our go-to lunch place. As soon as we say Michael's everyone wants an order. I get the chicken deluxe wrap every time and it is so yummy and filling. Coworkers always get the summer turkey and the game changer. Good prices, good food, good people working there. They argue sometimes because they're family but it's cool. Must try!"}
{"text":"Prior to this review, I had driven by Michael's a million times and had never gone in. But I am so glad I did.  From the outside, I didn't expect too much in terms of ambience.  But the inside is surprisingly adorable. It has comfortable seating and a cozy vibe that feels like you're at a friend's house. The prices are also super reasonable and the service is fast, so what's not to love?  You order at the counter, pick a table, and they'll bring you your lunch. I loved the summer turkey sandwich with a side of potato salad. All the ingredients were very fresh (down to the bread), and in very generous portions. Yet, I didn't feel guilty, and their sandwiches really heighten the game around town. It was huge, flavorful, and completely crave-worthy. They have a huge menu of sandwiches, salads and soups, and I could have easily chosen five other things. They also do catering, which I'm sure is equally wonderful.  Side note: this isn't an actual full service café. They have coffee, but it's not a full service bar. They also have Wi-Fi, and you just need to ask for the password. But you can totally grab lunch, ask for the wi-fi password, and hang out. Can't wait to revisit this homey family-owned business."}
{"text":"So I really do like this Deli for fresh food and good soups. But lately their quality and quantity is going down hill.  Attached to this review is the pic of a chicken tortilla soup that I ordered to go. I got half a cup with one piece of chicken in it. This is not the way to treat a regular customer. I know they have it in them to improve. So my advice check your to go order."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich place.  First time there they talked me into trying an Italian sub which isn't my first choice for a sandwich but it was beyond good!  Been going back almost 1x a week since. Their menu is huge with affordable prices.  Portions are very generous and I haven't had a bad bite yet. If you're in Twinsburg you gotta try this place"}
{"text":"This is a small, family owned business that has been here for about 15 years. Coincidentally, I have been coming to Mike's cafe for probably 15 years and have loved every one of my visits there.   The place primarily specializes in sandwiches but there are other options on the menu such as salads and pizza. Most items cost $7-10.   On the topic of sandwiches, the sandwiches that I have tried here are among my favorite, if not actually my favorite, period.   Forget about your subways, quiznos, penn stations, jersey mike's or any other sandwich place you visit and come try a sandwich Mike's Cafe. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I just can't do it anymore.  25 minutes to put together an Italian.  The food is still good, but it will take you between 15 and 30 minutes to get your food, for take out or done in.  If you think a sub is worth the wait, then here you go.  Maybe call ahead would work? There's got to be an answer, because the pain to benefit ratio is really slipping for Michael's."}
{"text":"Not too many people outside of the immediate area are aware that Michael's makes some of the best sandwiches in Cleveland. My friend used to live around a mile away and claims to have eaten every sandwich on the board. Not all at once, after many visits though. He said everything is outstanding. About a year or two or three ago I had the turkey and it was delicious. Yesterday, we split the asiago chicken wrap and corned beef sandwich. The corned beef is outstanding. It is a very lean cut which is what I like. It is not piled as high as Slyman's or any of those overrated places. I would prefer a lower stack of meat with only high quality cuts off the brisket. If you have ever had to cut a brisket of corned beef up, you would know what I am talking about because the fat can be gross. When I worked at a deli in college, I would sometimes have to cut the brisket. Sometimes hungover. It was really shitty experiences with brisket fat that has taught me to appreciate a lean cut of corned beef."}
