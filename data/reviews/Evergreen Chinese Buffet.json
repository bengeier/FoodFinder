{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese buffet in the area.  The food has been sitting forever, there was very little food available. Not worth the time or money. GROSS."}
{"text":"Foods are not fresh, the service is also... Especially the old waiter, very rude, upset me"}
{"text":"Standard Chinese buffet.  What's on there ranges from decent to pretty good.  Very limited rotation on the items, so if you liked something that was on the buffet today, there is an excellent chance it will be there the next time!   I keep hoping that they'll do away with the always pristine, never touched salad bar and replace it with another set of options."}
{"text":"Food is not nice  but service is good . Dumpling is always  over cooker  and noodle is too salty"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and usually good service behind food that is typical of Asian strip mall buffets. Usually the food is of good quality, and more traditional than adventuresome in the available selections, which I suspect is what clientele here want, as the place does a good business. However, beware the oil: everything fried tends to be swimming in it, as the food does not seem to be well-drained after frying, and is sometimes literally floating in oil in serving bins (every time more food is added, the oil accumulates...). The furnishings are attractive and the recently remodeled layout eases traffic flow. Overall a good place for a quick Asian bite or lunchtime pig-out."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese buffet I've ever been to. There weren't many choices and then food wasn't even very good. Very disappointed because I heard good things about it."}
{"text":"This is overall a great Chinese buffet. They have good general saos chicken and lemon chicken. The service is also decent. I would get this for takeout even before I went to some of the other Chinese places in town. I would come here again and was satisfied with the quality of the food. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"They have a decent selection of dishes and the crab legs are a plus but I wish beef and broccoli was available on the buffet. It's best to go on a Friday or Saturday evening because they are busier so the dishes are fresher. The dessert options could be better but the ice cream has improved recently. I think it was ice milk before."}
{"text":"I love going there to eat with my friends. Can't beat that good fried rice and General Tso! Not very expensive either!"}
{"text":"This is my son's favorite place for lunch. We love the chicken teriyaki skewers and fried dumplings.  I love the crab Rangoon and the chicken dishes with vegetables.  The soups are good too. This last visit we had awesome sautéed green beans.   The plates and cups and silverware were clean. They were constantly stirring the buffet trays and wiping spills and drips from the buffet surface. I am a germaphobe and have had no issues eating here the past 3 years. I wouldn't come back if I did."}
{"text":"I do not care for this Chinese buffet. The food is not very good, it's usually not fresh, and they put pepper on absolutely everything. Way too much pepper by the way. Like, way too much pepper.if you are craving Chinese head east a little bit towards Ravenna and hit number one instead."}
{"text":"Really rude guy at the front. Almost left due to his lack of customer service and negative attitude. Table waiter was friendly. Pretty good buffet for the price."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at the buffet in years but I do enjoy the lunch take out, it's always good"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years.  Today my family and I were there and the food was horrible. This establishment is not just for the College student the locals support this business as well. If the quality of food continues to decline they will go out of business."}
{"text":"Evergreen Buffet is meh. You won't say this is a 'Wow' place, nor a culinary delight, but it fills the need in your belly. They have all the staples, rice, rangoons, sweet and sour chic, and etc.  oh, the garlic green beans are very good.  It's all good, and will fill your hungry tummy.   Deserts are offered, canned pudding and cream puffs from somewhere. Frozen ice cream machine and cherry pastry thing.  We'll return again.  4 of us (adults) ate for $53."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went for dinner last night and the food was either stone cold or barely warm. We told our server/waiter and he then told the people that prepare the food and they basically said it was our fault because we took food from the top and that we should have taken from the bottom... yeah OK!!! They also said it was because the air conditioner was on... WOW. We've been going to Evergreen for close to ten years and we have never complained about anything but last night pretty much sealed the deal for us... we are done with them!! There are way too many places out there that appreciate their customers and understand the meaning of customer service."}
{"text":"Evergreen is my favorite Chinese food restaurant in this and surrounding areas.  I've been going with my family for years. The buffet area is not as large as some of the others, but the food quality is superior in my opinion.  Crab legs are included and they don't pull any of that \"crab legs cost extra\" bull crap I'm starting to see at other Chinese buffets.  Try the broccoli chicken and if you love hot and spicy try the volcanic three.  It always makes my eyes water but it's so good!   And I recently started getting take out there!  You can get a combo for around $6.50!"}
{"text":"I love everything about it. Great college dive. I get it every time I return to Kent."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I mean its a Chinese restaurant in america. Only complaint is the cream puffs sucked."}
{"text":"I love this place, but definitely for the lunch time price. Don't expect more than buffet level quality though. This food is great, for Chinese buffet food."}
{"text":"Overall a great buffet. We try to go early as the quality seems to lag as the day goes on. Service is like most Chinese joints, meh. Crab legs are rarely very good. The 4 stars are for lunch."}
{"text":"The road trip continues...  I met with a family friend and he took me to this place.  Pretty average Chinese buffet, as far as buffets go.  Dinner had crab legs but beefed up ones, not just refuse of the ocean that most places serve.  Not a bad choice if you happen to be passing through Kent."}
{"text":"Went here on Father's Day my husband loves General Tso Chicken.  It was nice, clean food was decent.  Best part is they don't charge extra for the crab legs."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible. I got two plates of food, the first I just picked around on and the second one I got so that I could give the food another chance. I would've gone for a third but I already wanted to throw up thinking about the first two. Our server looked absolutely miserable, he brought us out drinks then kind of just stared at us awkwardly throughout the rest of our meals. Honestly the food doesn't even looked appetizing, and has awkward weird labels on them like \"crispy sweet chicken\" and \"cheese balls\". I know it's harsh to judge buffets for food quality, and the price was right (especially for a college town buffet), so I'll leave two stars instead of the one star I'm inclined to leave."}
{"text":"My mom used to love this place 6 years ago, so I thought I'd try it for a quick lunch today. What a mistake! At 200pm, the bins were all filled nicely, with room temperature food. Stacks  of egg fu yung 10 high meant only the one on bottom was hot, but it was swimming in  water. The fried chicken was cold, as general tsos chicken. The fried rice was cold, as was the longest mein. The \"crispy chicken\" was all soggy. I was excited to try the lemon chicken, and it probably would have been great - were it hotter than room temperature. The wonton soup was warm, but tasteless. The egg rolls were OK but not fresh. I cannot express how disappointed I was with this food. I feared digestive issues, so I just stopped and paid my bill.  Since it was not busy, the waitress did a good job clearing my dishes. Maybe you have to hit this place at noon and 600pm to get hot food. Mom is rolling over in her grave, as she would definitely not be eating here now."}
{"text":"I see poor reviews.  My experience was great.  Also the food was HOT.  Any buffet lovers understand that is more often than not an issue.  And you see oriental eating there.  More authentic than most"}
{"text":"First off, the manager sucked. I have NEVER said this in my life for any review EVER! He was a huge grouch, mean and very persnickity! I would not go back for that reason alone. THEN there was the food. I have eaten food in 3/4 of the States in our great country and this was not even food that I would ever eat \"on purpose\". I was so discusted! First of all, the buffet was tiny and had all chicken - or at least it seemed so. The soup was the only good and HOT food and they ran out as soon as we got there of the dumplings and it took almost an hour to refill them. SORRY but NOT SORRY this place is awful."}
{"text":"I think the owners of all the Chinese buffets in northeast Ohio got together in 2013 and decided \"let's all be mediocre, that way we'll get equal business\".   Fun Buffet in Streetsboro went downhill fast. Mandarin Seafood Buffet in Twinsburg was marginal at best before the remodel and I haven't returned to try it. The Royal Buffet near Chapel Hill is hit or miss. The Pacific Buffet in Macedonia is awful. Most recently, the Evergreen Buffet has begun its decline.  Back in the day, Evergreen was good almost every time. The service was usually attentive, and the food was usually good and at the correct temperature. The last couple times I've visited, including today on New Year's Day, it's just been average to below average. Nothing was particularly bad today, just so-so food that wasn't up to temperature. The young man who is usually at the register is never rude, he just is very curt and unfriendly. He never asks if your meal was good. Today's waiter was also unfriendly and never asked if the food was good."}
{"text":"Great Chinese buffet! Traditional offerings that you find at a buffet. Cost is $6 for lunch and $9 for dinner. Lunch menu is slightly different than dinner and I enjoy both. The owner is local and you'll often see him and his family working and eating there which is always a good sign. :-)"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area! All the chicken and sauces were great.  Server was friendly. Buffet seemed very clean and frequently refilled."}
{"text":"3.5  Most buffets are not very good in my opinion but I almost gave this one 4 stars bc I was kind of impressed. I have had my share of Chinese food and this really was pretty good. They have a great selection, change out the food quickly, and everything does seem fresh. Now, I wouldn't go to the salad bar here looking for fresh lettuce, but sticking to the Chinese part, there are a couple highlights that I found to be just delicious. The crab Rangoon. Ok these were fantastic. I had more instead of having dessert bc I liked them so much. Also, any of the chicken dishes were good along with the green beans, my husband even tried the chicken wings and they were cooked well and nice and crispy! The Chinese donuts and a nice cream machine rounds this out to a really great meal.   I hate to do but on the down side, the white rice and the fried rice wasn't very good. Kinda hard like it was sitting so a long time and as a Chinese place, you gotta do something about that. Also, the sweet and sour wasn't fantastic. That's not my favorite dish anyways but even my husband who really likes sweet and sour chicken wasn't impressed. Also, like I said earlier, I wouldn't come here for a salad.   Sometimes you just need a lot of Chinese food....well I do anyways and this is a solid place to go. I will be back dominating at the buffet"}
{"text":"Classic Chinese buffet. This is a cheap way to enjoy some crab legs!"}
{"text":"I ordered the extra spicy schezuan tofu but was given a mild Hunan tofu. I politely told the waiter (grumpy guy named Mike) that I was given the wrong order. He went and got the manager - a 30 something burly Chinese guy with a Brooklyn accent. The manager yelled at me in front of my company and said I was wrong. He ATE OFF MY PLATE and said it was schezuan tofu. Then he took it into the back and returned with \"new\" food. Aka a cup of chilie paste in it. He threw it down and stood over me and said \"I'm going to watch you eat this.\" Next day I had food poisoning. Seriously people, this kind of crap is not worth it. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst chinese food I have ever had. I went once in the middle of the week for dinner and was completely disappointed. There are very few options to choose from for a buffet and all of the items I tried were not good... The rice tasted burnt, the chicken was slimey, and the eggroll was very oily. Yuk yuk!  I did give them one more chance, thinking that the quality might be better for a dinner on a weekend. Nope! There are some much better chinese buffets in the area. I would not waste my time with Evergreen."}
{"text":"Inasmuch as we are cursed to never find a Thai restaurant open when we stop to dine, we went two doors west and ate at Evergreen. It was a weekday 1:30 PM or so for reference. Most of the items were reasonably hot and reasonably good.  Most notable exceptions were as follows: the pork dumplings varied from the norm, which is steamed then pan seared on one side, these were fried and pure leather on the exterior.with a reasonably good interior if one could access same.  Most of the battered/fried chicken based dishes were roughly equal parts dough and meat.  The \"gravy\" for the egg foo yung  was something other than gravy, more broth than anything.  Some of the items had not been refreshed as recently as would have been ideal.  Service was somewhat indifferent and just adequate.  Nothing here a heaping tablespoon of chili oil didn't put out of one'smind."}
{"text":"This was a mediocre experience. The table we were sat to had a dirty floor, the selection of food was slim and most of the food was cold. The guy who was supposed to check the food sat at a table and played ipad games the whole time. The chicken and broccoli dish was 95% broccoli and 5% small bits of chicken. A bug also fell onto the table while we ate. The food also didnt taste good and tasted like chemicals and bitter. I ate until I was full as it was $12 a person but I will not return here."}
