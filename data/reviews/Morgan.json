{"text":"Very good fish and seafood, but if you go there for lunch, make sure you call ahead so that they know to expect customers."}
{"text":"This place is food taste good but they are extremely very expensive especially appetizers. This place is ripp off. They come up with their own price especially if you don't order food from the menu. Owner says from menu order taste is not the same as you pick your own fish and the price would few dollar difference. We ordered grill shrimp there were only 13 pcs and they charged  $25. Also we ordered 2 whole grill fish, rice and salad our bill came up $175. Guys don't go there if you do go take $$$$$"}
{"text":"Ordered Fried whole Dorade fish and it is excellent. Very happy with the meal. Very excellent customer service as well."}
{"text":"Sea food was fresh and well prepared, same for the seafood soup .... the wether was cold so it was just perfect"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked fish. Went there because I had gotten a tuango offer but will definitely return for more. The service is  extremely friendly and their menu looks really good. The tuango offer was limited to certain plates but the rest also looked good. Their menu contains pictures and the result is that you want to try everything. My advice is try the place our if you like eating fish you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Friday night, it was top shelf. Had a wonderful time, was very well looked after all night. The food was amazing!! By the far one of the best seafood places our city has. Bring your own wine is always good for dinners on a budget, makes the whole experience just a bit more personal."}
{"text":"Morgan Restaurant Poissonnerie is a Fishmonger, so you know the fish is fresh.  I went for lunch with a small group and enjoyed the fresh fish.  The manager placed our tables nicely so that everyone was able to talk to everyone.  The service was slow but worth waiting for.  Found my  Dorade fish a little on the greasy side. Did not appreciate that the menu on line and the menu in store had a significant difference in price!   I also did not appreciate that no one received a bill but we all paid taxes."}
{"text":"It's my first time here , the place and service and food is so good and delicious , I ordered soup and salad and fish grill , everything was so good and defiantly will come here again!"}
{"text":"I came to this place after hearing an advertisement on the radio. I started off with the seafood soup which tasted amazing. The seasoning on it was exceptional. I then followed with the dorado plate, the fish was seasoned beautifully and was very juicy. The service was also great they go out of there way to ensure you are happy. This is my first time I visit and defiantly not my last."}
