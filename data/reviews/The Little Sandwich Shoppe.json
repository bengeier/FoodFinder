{"text":"Me and my wife stopped over Toronto to meet our sister in law who gave us a tour in the neighbourhood until noon when we parked by Sheraton Pacific Mall for a brief lunch.  We found this tidy and clean shop manned by a pleasant lady Wendy.  We ordered the mushroom, the pumpkin and the veggie soups plus veggies sandwiches.  The soups are creamy, silky and yummy, tempting us to buy two more back home for my sister in law's children. The sandwiches are filled with fresh veggies and delicious sauce.  Just healthy and thumb-up. The coffee is just far better than what we drink in the coffee chain stores nearby. Keep up the good food and hoping that we meet again maybe next year when we come over on our planned trips to Mexico."}
{"text":"Amazing place for soups and salads. Salad quality is similar to expensive upscale restaurants. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Definitely recommend it if you looking for some healthy lunch."}
{"text":"The Little Sandwich Shoppe is located inside the Sheraton Parkway foodcourt. The traffic is average during weekday lunch time.This shop is one of a kind and stands out in the food court because the rest of the stores has typical Asian dishes, rice and noodle. It's rare to find a sandwich shop in an Asian food court. I ordered the chicken wrap and clam chowder soup combo ($10). I would say that the food is comparable to upscale sandwich cafe. The chicken wrap is so big and super tasty. It has the right amount of ingredients inside, very fresh and yummy sauce. The clam chowder soup is very creamy and you can find countless clam inside. I found that if you order soup from other bigger chain, it always taste like powder add with water or it's always super salty. And I guaranteed you this place is not, it's comparable to the soup made in the high-end restaurants. I would highly recommend this place, for sure you would notice significant difference between other bigger chain out there. And if you want healthy food, this is the right place!"}
{"text":"I work in Richmond Hill and it is very difficult to find a good sandwhich shop here that isn't Subway or any of the chains. This place was clean and the food was great. The lady who u assume is the owner was extremely pleasant and helpful there. I got the turkey and havarti sandwich which was fresh and delicious. The mushroom soup I also got had big pieces of whole mushroom. Will definitely go back!"}
