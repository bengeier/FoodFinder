{"text":"With a secluded feeling and an amazing view of the Toronto skyline, Pauper's Pub arguably has one of the best patios in Toronto. The wings are slightly charred and saucy, and they have a pretty decent draft selection. While the second floor lounge is a cozy space, the first floor could use a reno because with its handmade 60's fabric lampshades and dull brass railings, it definitley doesn't hide it's age well."}
{"text":"Nice looking place, but service needs help.  Seated ourselves and took way too long to get anyone to notice us.  Since we weren't getting any service, I went to the bar and ordered two drinks.   I was told \"no\", that someone will be with me.  So I had to go back to my table and wait even longer for someone to notice us.  After a much longer wait, we finally ordered drinks, which took way too long to arrive.  Our table was soaking wet.  The food was decent, so I'll give 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday evening and opted for the street level patio.  The location is great and it is not often that you have a choice of multiple patios.  I have been on the rooftop one and on a warm summer day, it can get really packed.    The beer choices are average and the food is not so great.  I guess you don't go to pubs like this for the cuisine though!  I agree with other yelpers that it is extremely convenient, but is never really a destination for me.  It is one of those places that I walk past and say to the person with me, \"hey, you wanna go for a beer in here?\"  The service was fine, but the patio was about a quarter full and there was one server covering the whole patio.  By the way, the Women's bathroom is grossitating!  I was not happy about that."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my girls and I on a friday night. They sat us at 2 separate tables-mind u, we were a group of 15 girls. We had a rude server with an atittude idk where he finds who pretty much had a serious face all night long, i mean come on, u r in d customer service business. The food was also terrible.  Yikes!! Never again!! First  & last."}
{"text":"Was at the Patio around the corner, place looks great, service sucks, waitress brought us food, however no napkins or cutlery, had to go in and get it myself......."}
{"text":"They have a great view with their rooftop patio, however I got a really bad case of food poisoning on my last visit which has deterred me from returning. I had the Thai chicken fingers and they made me terribly sick."}
{"text":"The patios are great, the service is decent enough, and the drink selection is solid. But the food is very very subpar. A pub that can't do fries & wings properly is a pub not worth eating at. Every bar should at least be able to do burgers, fries, and wings without messing them up, and that's why I just couldn't give this place 3 stars or higher. There are so many other better food options close by, I would eat there and just come here to drink on the patio.  UPDATE: The manager messaged me to address this review, which I can appreciate, they want to put things right and they care about their customers' experience. I respect that and if I could add a half star, I would bump this up to 2.5 stars.  I stand by what I wrote about the food though, it was very subpar. However, it was one experience, and Paupers does have enough going for it that I would give it another chance.  So after I have another meal there, I'll update this review to reflect that experience."}
{"text":"My first time here was a few summer's ago, when I participated in the UofT summer women's lacrosse rec league --- the girls really seemed to like this bar. Over the past couple of years it has not failed as a place for dinner, catch up over drinks, or even the first date location for the man currently in my life : ) (And when he suggested Pauper's, I gave him cred for having good taste!"}
{"text":"This place is best any day of the week from 3pm-6pm when all of their apps are half price.  A few other reviews have said that the apps are only half price during the week, but this is not the case, weekends they are cheap too, so how can you go wrong.  The food has always been good, although it is limited to typical bar type apps, nachos, wings, calamari, onion rings, etc..., but since these simple items are cooked correctly they are always tasty.  If you aren't up for apps, they always have a stuffed burger special that changes daily which is always good too.  The atmosphere is cozy, and the bathrooms are clean, so no complaints about that either.  The best part about this place is the giant roof top patio and bar that is great to sit on in the summer for people watching and the views of the city.  If the roof is full, there is another patio on ground level that is nice to sit on on hot days, as it is usually all shade.  The final thing this place has going is constant drink specials.  Pints of domestic beer are cheap until 5pm, and even after that there is usually some sort of beer special.  On top of that, you can get a bottle of wine for less than $30, which is a steal of a deal in the city!  I am here at least once every couple of weeks, and will continue being a regular customer so long as they keep up what they are currently doing!"}
{"text":"I recently booked a party for 40 people in the 2nd floor piano bar. Not only was the service outstanding and the manager very accommodating but the fee for booking was incredibly low. The location was convenient for everyone and a great time was had by all.  I can't recommend them highly enough. Thanks from the Opera folks!"}
{"text":"I hosted a private reception here for a large theatre opening and couldn't be happier with the result. The advancement of the night was smooth, quick and the manager was SUPER flexible, offering suggestions of how to come in under budget and maximize all $ spent.    The food was amazing.  We had a Mediterranean buffet with fresh grilled veggies, spreads, cheeses, FRESH breads- not what you would expect from a \"pub\"; and to satisfy those with \"pub\" cravings, we mixed in some more traditional pub fare as passed hors d'oeuvres.  My guests, who were not pub-goers at all, raved about the food afterwards.  The staff was ON it- I have worked in the restaurant industry for 17 years, and even though this is a \"pub\" they were as attentive and caring as if we were in a fine dining establishment.  I would come back and do another event in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The rooftop patio is very nice for drinks. I used to find their simple burger one of the best in town. For some reason they changed it about two years ago. Became very mediocre.   Go for a drink on the patio, it's worth it. Might want to skip the food."}
{"text":"I could really spend too much time at this bar! On the positive side, they have some really good drink specials, and the food can be very tasty, and the way the seating is arranged is quite fun - you almost always end up feeling like you're tucked away in a corner rather than out in a room of a million people.  On the down side, Paupers is a complete pain to bring people to, because they don't have pitchers and they insist on giving you one bill, which means every evening out there ends with the bad vibe created when a bunch of drunk people with no cash try to split a huge bill. I've actually stopped going lately just because it's so inconvenient and the bill thing is always such a huge pain - both things they could easily just fix and allow me to have the ideal two-story dive-bar experience. So close, Paupers, so close ;)"}
{"text":"Chances are, you have probably already been to Pauper's Pub.  Even if you only remember it as \"the really huge pub with the rooftop AND side patio\".  In fact, it was one of the very first bars I went to after moving to Toronto, and I have been back for everything from business meetings to nerdy internet meetups to the Toronto After Dark Film Festival's famous \"Pub After Dark\" nights.  Its central Annex location makes it an ideal meeting ground for groups coming from different areas of the city, and unless it's St. Patty's or some other major holiday you are pretty much guaranteed to find a seat.   Paupers is very much like its sister pub down the road, the Madison - same owners, same menu, same fetish for huge amounts of patio space, brass railings and red velvet.  The menu is full of your standard pub fare, with a few kicky exceptions like the \"loaded\" fries topped with cheese and pulled pork (we'll see how long that menu item lasts) and the salmon \"burger\".    The staff are without exception friendly and seasoned veterans of the huge amount of people traffic pouring through the pub.  Each floor has its own bar, as do the patio seating areas.  This means you're always within quick reach of another cold beer.  Kitchen items can take a while, but appetizers never seem to come out much faster than main meals, so stifle your urge to over-order and just pace yourself.  A lovely tradition is that starters are 1/2 off before 6pm (used to be 7pm, grumble grumble), which means if you're an early bird or a happy hour after work type, you are in luck.  Several of the appetizers also are on special different days, so be sure to ask your server what the specials are. The only tragedy is that we don't live in a climate in which we could enjoy that amazing rooftop patio year round. Appetizers are affordable, with a few App combos for large groups.  Burgers and sandwiches run in the $8 - $10 range, with the only items breaking the $10 cap being the mains, which cost around $11 - $15.  Favorites: Voodoo Chicken fingers, onion rings, Lumberjack \"burger\" (chicken and bacon, mmm), mussels, cold beer on a the rooftop patio on a beautiful day or a cozy booth on a cold night. Everyone seems to love the stuffed burgers.  Needs Work: I've never had luck with nachos there, they have switched up their style but the nacho problem persists. I have never had any of their \"Classics\" main courses (ie; meatloaf, pasta, schnitzel) but I've only ever seen anyone eat the fish and chips, which received a passing grade.  Finding seating for big parties can be tricky outside of patio season or during peak hours, the main two floors have booths which make large parties difficult, unless you snag the party room on the first floor. I once had a birthday party in the back area of the first floor.  We took up five booths.  Luckily, the staff was kind enough to patiently help us wade through the resulting bill."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I am not a pub fan. They are usually to loud with lousy food and even worse service...BUT paupers changed my mind!   The service was outstanding! The food even better! (I had a Caesar salad with steak OMG  the steak melted in my mouth!)   Atmosphere is very warm and welcoming with cozy booths, lighting is at a nice level for a first date or even drinks with the guys. They have achieved a great balance.   The only down side and why I did not give 5 stars was they don't have debit. We had to cut our evening short because we needed to run up the street for a bank machine. However they do have a generic ATM in the front but I am to much of a worry wart to use those ones..   I WILL return to this pub... I am from Guelph and I will 100% say..it's worth the drive..or better yet take the train to Bathurst station and walk 3 minutes south to bloor they are on the south side of Bloor"}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night (Jan 23rd) for a few on beers with a buddy. I like the place, great selection of beers, nice atmosphere and decent prices. Have to say I was disappointed with our waitress(short blonde), she went out of her way to ignore us. She wasn't overwhelmingly busy but she ignored us even though our beers were empty and we were obviously ready for another round. We ended up leaving early just on principle. I would go back but I would turn right around and walk out if she was working."}
{"text":"This is for the service, the bar is decent, specials are great but our server Karen was fantastic. She's sweet, on point and knows her stuff. Will definitely be back just for her and her kind, professional manner and playing along with my terrible puns :) I've been here before many times but she's by far the most personable person I've had the pleasure of having as a server."}
{"text":"Cozy booths with cozy seats. I came here on Halloween and to my surprise it wasn't too packed. One of the male employees dressed in a green body suit, which was hilarious and very....tight. I wasn't feeling festive but did want to come for a drink. Service was good and our drinks came out in a timely manner.  I can't judge the food yet but maybe one day ill come here for something to munch on."}
{"text":"Nice size and location but I found the barman/owner to be rude.  I ordered a pint and while he was pouring it I asked if they were looking for staff.  He may have been asked this question a lot but he could have been a bit friendlier with his response.  Instead, he kind of frowned and said they'd just hired a load of new staff. He seemed pissed off that I'd asked.  Also, I was going to order some food but I noticed that he had some kind of flakey scalp issue and there was a pile of dandruff on his shoulders.  I'm glad I noticed before I ordered any food.  The pint was okay but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"A pretty average pub. Went on a Tuesday and it was pretty packed and noisy. The service was quick and gruff - didn't really care for it either way. The food is good for the value - the store bought fries were cooked well and the burgers were pretty good. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but if I'm in the area and really hungry I'd be happy to go here. Oh yeah - they don't take debit but have an ATM at the entrance. Super convenient!"}
{"text":"Bartender overcharged us for our beers. He charged more than the price on the specials board outside, and even more than the regular price that it said on the menu. Unfortunately. We only realized after we left. Will not return, theres absolutely no excuse for overcharging customers."}
{"text":"I really will never go back. Unfortunately, as nice as the staff was, I felt extremely ignored and for all of my waiting and patience, and energy put into just placing my order, the food was pretty awful. I was prepared for the place to be busy, it was the Eurocup final after all. I'm a server, and I understand. I'm a server and that's how i can tell when someone is trying and when someone is not. Industry people are known for giving the best tips, but I assume that the young woman who waited on me, assumed she wouldn't receive much of a tip, as I was alone. I came in and sat myself. Right next to me was a server on a computer, ringing in an order. Thought it was strange she didn't acknowledge me, but thought maybe I wasnt in her section, and that she was focused on what she was doing. I could tell she was new. At this point, I'm nowhere near annoyed. An older staff member came by and gave me a menu, and told me who my server was (surprise it was the girl on the computer). I moved tables so i could charge my cell phone, still in the same servers section. I had to ask her every time I wanted a drink.Now, i know busy, this girl wasn't that busy. She would glance at me, glance at my empty glass, and casually walk by. I had to ask her to order. When I came back from the bathroom my food was waiting for me. I didnt see the waitress again for about 10 minutes, so finally I could ask her for ketchup, mustard, anda  new drink. she dropped everything off, and left my empty glass on the table. it remained there until i was done eating. i asked her for my bill, and for the first time in my life, didn't tip. I didn't tip because i could see she could've payed more attention. I put more effort into my time at paupers then the server did. I left her a note on my bill. 'sorry, service was awful!' ive never done that either. instead of assuming i wouldnt tip, she couldve easily made $10 off me, with little effort. maybe that doesn't mean anything to her. beyond that, I would've come back to this establishment, and now i wont, despite some of the nicer staff. lets move on: i ordered the veggie burger with salad (as much as i couldn't resist the 'quality mcCain fries' listed on the menu! haha), not the worst thing ive ever eaten, but definitely not interesting at all. for a pub in the annex, i definitely expected more. too bad, i think this place could be great."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for a few pints last night and saw a party of mice run from the booth beside us. Immediately afterwards our server offered us half priced appetizers to which we both exclaimed NO THANK YOU! We got our bill and left shortly after. Would not recommend anything here."}
{"text":"Great experience at Paupers Pub! Came here with a couple girlfriends who were greeted at the door by the friendly security guard who told us live music was upstairs on the second floor. We sat around the horseshoe bar which was pretty cool and the friendly bartender let us know all the amazing deals! 20$ bottles of wine \"wow\" and she said every sunday and thursday $4-$5 mixed drinks we will defiantly be coming back! She also mixed us these shots and took her time to ask us the ingredients we like and don't like! Overall great atmosphere the live music was pretty cool to there was a girl playing the violin. I think we will come back on a thursday for 4 $ mixed drinks!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were at El-Furniture Warehouse earlier hoping to watch the All-Star game along with some drink and food. Sadly they didn't air the game so we decided to go to Paupers. We've been to Paupers quite a few times now and this is the first time that we've experienced bad service. When we went in, they weren't airing the game yet so we just sat at a seat that had TVs accessible to us, but they had some of the TVs on SNL so we asked to move seats so we can watch the game at the TV that had it on. But the all the other seats that were facing that TV was occupied so we sat down at a seat near the door which had a lamp post in the way of the TV. So we just ordered drinks and the girl at the bar was serving us. When our drinks came, there were finally seats available that we facing the TV, so we asked the server to move again and they allowed us. When we were ready to order, the other server said the girl at the bar was still our server, so we had to wait for her to come. When she finally came, we ordered just an appetizer since we already had a bit of food from El-Furniture Warehouse. So we ate the appetizer and ordered some more drinks (which took a while to come) and then we decided to ask for the menu again . But after she left the menu, she didn't come back to ask us what we wanted to order. We waited for quite a long time and I was starting to get annoyed. As I looked over to the bar, I noticed that she was on her cellphone and also watching the TV rather than coming to serve us. We waited a long time and finally decided to not order and just leave. We asked for the menu so obviously we wanted to order. We literally waited more than half an hour and that shouldn't be the case considering it was not busy and also she was able to go on her cellphone. We were excited to come and enjoy the game along with food and drink but ended up with disappointment. They should really fix their service."}
{"text":"Pauper's saving grace is its rooftop patio. It is probably the only reason I go here from time to time. The drinks are ok, caesar tasted pretty good although it could do with some garnish - it's what adds to the fun of ordering a caesar! Servers seem to be hit or miss - had a nice waiter when I went today, but my last visit was kind of a disaster. The last time I visited, I ordered a sangria. The sangria was served to me with a fly in it. I politely notified the waitress that she had served me a drink with a fly in it and her response was quite surprising. Rather than apologize and offer me a new drink, she said \"So would you like me to scoop it out with a spoon?\" Um...does she know that flies eat poo?? When I told her that I did not think that was hygienic and I would like a new drink, her attitude made it seem like I was being unreasonable and inconveniencing her. I could see her take the drink to the bartender, who then looked pissed at having to make another drink. I really hope that it is not their practice to just scoop out an offending contaminant and re-serve the food/beverage.   If it weren't for the roof top patio, I'd never go back. Why do I have to love roof top patios so much..."}
{"text":"Paupers pub is definitely one of my go to places in the annex. I've been there on several occasions for birthdays or just a social night with a couple of my friends. Wicked atmosphere inside since the building used to be a bank back in the day. Lots of decent beers on tap for the beer lovers out there plus some yummy pub food options. If you're looking for a decent place to go out with your friends I would definitely plan a night out at the paupers pub."}
{"text":"Continues to be relentlessly meh. Fine spot for an after league game beer. Passable nachos and other standard college pub fare. Decent cold beer."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the worst experience eating at a pub in downtown Toronto. Unattentive, uncaring, rude staff, and expensive cold food.  Got a seat at the patio with some friends I hadnt seen in a while and for reasons could not drink, the waitress was rude and rolled her eyes when we didnt order alcoholic drinks. Took incredibly long whenever we asked for orders on anything. On multiple occasions she would make eye contact with us when we asked for assistance but ignored us or sneered at us for asking for her.  When my food came (Thursday's chef special, $16) it was a few scraps of cauliflower and a lone pork chop that barely filled the plate. Cauliflower and pork chop were cold. My friends linguini was cold. When we asked the waitress to heat my dish up, it took quite a while just to be returned to me cold again. I ate it anyway because I was starving but I might as well have not because I was still starving after the bland meal.  When I said this wasnt okay, she offered to get the manager to see if there was something she could do for us. Waited forever. We asked for a refill of our waters which we hadn't gotten once. After a long wait she brings one glass of water (I guess for the three of us to share) and we ask for the bill because I just wanted to leave and get a full meal. Took another incredibly long time to get the bill. Manager never showed.  Awful. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Do not get the nachos. The nachos used to be decent, but then changed to \"nachos supreme for one\". Which means they took out half the nachos, and kept the $14 price tag. I'm sorry, but if you're going to serve half the nachos, charge half the price. Paupers has been a regular spot for me for years, and I don't want to give it a bad review, so I'll settle on 3 stars (because the rest of it is fine) but come on, those nachos are robbery."}
{"text":"They killed my favourite salad. There's something magical about finding a healthy option in the sea of thai food and fried chicken that is bloor&bathurst,  that has everything you like, nothing you hate, AND you don't have to make yourself. Magical!  I used to live in the area and Pauper's was a solid local pub choice. I have been here dozens of times and concur with other positive reviews. The tandoori chickpea salad was worth a trip on it's own (a trip I've made several times). Sometime in the year since I moved they changed their menus. Previously prices were reasonable, which in an area heavily populated by students made sense and there were a few gems to be found.   I dragged my boyfriend there last night because we were in the area and I missed that glorious salad. The price had gone up to almost $15 (fine, inflation, #worthit, whatever..) but what arrived was HALF THE SIZE it used to be. I was still starving after (previously I could barely finish it) and went home and made something else, mourning the demise of a favourite. Boyfriend had a sandwich and I'm told it was acceptable.   As a post-script to the management, who I see monitor reviews (which is nice) - I did not complain to our server. She was friendly and attentive and I'd wager not responsible for menu design. Besides which, I was tired and hangry and wanted to compose my thoughts."}
{"text":"Best Wellington in Toronto.  After the obligatory Saturday-afternoon java-jolt at the Green Beanery, my cosmopolitan companion and I moved east for something a little more libacious.  This was, after all, stop number nine on the Epic Birthday Bender.  I suggested Paupers because on both of my prior visits I had been served the most delicious pint of Wellington I've had anywhere (and I've drank a lot of Wellington in my time).  I was not disappointed; my Wellington Pale Ale was beergasmic and Emily \"I love me some stout\" H. had an equally delicious Guinness.  I've heard they clean their beer lines religiously here; it shows.  We were also taken care of by a friendly and professional server, which is always nice.  Every time I've been, there's been room at the bar or in the dining room.  There's also a semi-private room that looks like it seats about ten.  The rooftop patio will be a fantastic place to hang in the summertime, though I think beer options up there are limited.  I can't speak to the food yet, but I'll be sure to revisit and post an update."}
{"text":"I actually had one of the most horrible restaurant experiences here, mostly due to the staff and not due to the food. We came with a larger party of around 15 on a Saturday evening. It was early enough in the night that it wasn't very busy yet, especially in our dining area on the second floor. Firstly we had an extremely rude waitress who sassed a few of our group and snapped at one of us when we asked for our beverage orders. Next, our orders took around 45 minutes to come, and when they did they were completely mixed up, with at least half of us getting the wrong order. One of our waitresses continued to be rude to us the entire night, snapping at every request and slamming down cutlery/plates. The food objectively was adequate, regular pub fare. Among our group we had tried a variety of burgers, the fish and chips, and soup. However for the experience and the lack of common courtesy we definitely would not go back."}
{"text":"Went to paups with some pals for some darts, beers, and burgs - before the big gig, of course. What followed was 45minutes of waiting for a not-so-fresh burg AFTER chilling with said pals for 30 minutes already. It's Saturday. And the Leafs were losing."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great rooftop patio in the summer and service is never slow.  Similar decor as the Madison but it's a lot more intimate and less frat friendly. The mixed drinks are well priced and you can actually taste the booze in them which is a nice change. Half priced wings on Wednesday is a steal of a deal. 2 pounds of wings with fries for $8.50. You pay more for a box of frozen wings in the grocery store. They're decent sized wings with a good amount of meat on them and just the right amount of sauce.   The Sexi Mexi burger is the best. Can't go wrong with guac and jalapenos on a burger.   Definitely one of my favourite pubs in the city :)"}
{"text":"Zero stars, but that isnt possible. DO NOT GO HERE. They refused business to my friend who has a physical disability. They assumed she was drunk because she has a limp. They completely embarrassed her and made her walk in front of them. Does she need a giant sign that she has a disability? She's a fucking human being that deserves respect."}
{"text":"I went to Pauper's Pub with a group of four and we were all very impressed with our meals.  As a huge eggs benny fan, I had to try their benny option. Pauper's has one of the best hollandaise sauces I have ever tasted. And having the base of a biscuit instead of an english muffin was surprisingly yummy.   I will be returning! Great service, great food, and affordable!"}
{"text":"We ducked in on a rainy Sunday to grab some dinner and a drink. We were delighted to find there were 1/2 price starters from 3-6pm! Nachos and tacos were excellent and even comes with chilli for dipping. Everyone enjoyed their mains. Service was excellent! Friendly and very quick!"}
{"text":"If your looking for decent drink prices, beer that is poured with care, a venue that can handle large groups without a booking and good live music, then paupers is the place."}
{"text":"L'une des valeurs sures du quartier Bathurst, un étage et un rooftop avec vue imprenable sur Toronto. Choix de bières correct et restauration de bars pubs à la carte : nachos, burgers, sandwichs. Service rapide et efficace.  One of my favorite bars in the bathurst district, one floor and a rooftop with an amazing view of Toronto. Good choice of beers and goods meals : burgers, nachos and sandwiches. Staff is cool and quick!"}
{"text":"During the day, patient with kids.  In the evening, great for people watching.  The mixed drinks are stiff and the atmosphere is boisterous.  It's not like I can say it's stand out for any one thing... yet I keep ending up at Paupers."}
{"text":"Paupers Pub has been a nice meeting spot for nights out. It's location is great with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby along with the Bloor St. Cinema across the street. And it's very close to Lee's Palace too making it a perfect before concert meetup spot. There are different areas, or rooms in the place along with the different levels, which can be reserved if you have a group. A friend has done this many times and there have been no problems, just many accolades to the staff and management. The food has been good there as well. I've heard there is a back patio, but haven't made it out there yet. Some businesses are Toronto landmarks and Paupers Pub is one of them. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I don't like my pubs huge or my visual sense overwhelmed.   The beer was fine....the atmosphere ok....but the whole thing was just kind of meh.  If I were in the area with a bigger group, then perhaps I would be back, but I wouldn't seek this place out."}
{"text":"This won't be much of a review, because Paupers really isn't anything special.   The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that it smelled like puke. Pretty bad first impression right there. When I went to the washrooms, it was pretty surprising, because the bathroom actually smelled better (nice air freshener guys.)  The next thing I noticed was the outrageously red plush seats...tacky, but super comfy. Unfortunately, because the place smelled like vomit it really made me wonder what sort of stains might be lurking in the fibers. Kind of like when you ride the subway.  Service was Ok to start off with, but after the second round we pretty much got ignored. They have $6 martinis on Wednesday, but only from 6 to 8pm (and I arrived slight too late to take advantage of that).  Aside from that, it was the usual pub drinks, with the usual pub atmosphere and the usual pub crowd.   OH! I lied, there was something very memorable about Paupers. One of the servers looked just like the cowboy at the bowling alley from The Big Lebowski.  Same mustache, but sadly no cowboy hat."}
{"text":"I had a get together with a couple of my classmates and one of them recommended this place. We decided to try the roof top patio, to our luck seats were available.   The waitress which happened to not be our waitress if you know what I mean, helped us got seated, was very kind and actually really helpful. She had to find our waitress when we were ready to order cause ours never came.   Now here comes the part where I dreaded the most. Our waitress had such a serious attitude, she looks like the type of person who was hating her life. She has such a terrible attitude as if everything we asked for was a nuisance. Was ordering one thing per person too much?  And asking to pay our bill? Total of 4 people including me. We didn't even bother ordering more drinks because we didn't want to be bothered by her.  The food as well took longer than it should and I'm talking about an hour for a burger.  If I had the first waitress I think my experience would've been a lot different. She was a mess but at least she did it with a smile and was concerned about  our well being intermittently. Our waitress didn't bother checking up on us at all the only time she actually put any kind of effort was when she had to give our utensils, food, and the bottles of ketchup, mustard etc. Else she pretty much disappeared.   Overall not coming back definitely not worth going through that kind of experience again. There are tons of pubs nearby with better service and more menu item selections."}
{"text":"Stopped by this way after a play nearby with family and friends for a quick bite and to seek refuge from the Polar Vortex.   The place was packed but found one long table hidden in a little pocket. Perfect for our larger group but the light was broken so we had to make due with candles. 4pm and candle light? Why not!   The service was quite slow and the food came to us on the slightly cooler side with dips missing. I know it's busy and I have grace for those in this industry but still.   Regardless, my sweet potato fries were what you would expect and my burger? That, alone, almost gave this place a higher star rating.   Sexi Mexi Burger: an ok seasoned patty, but topped with fresh chili, guacamole and lots of jalapeños and ur cheese and tomato and lettuce! Mmmmessymmmmmm!   I love your non-traditional burger! And this was delightful as I'm a big Mexican food lover too!   The low point of our experience was the wait for our bills at the end, contemplating a shameful dine and dash...don't worry, we did pay.   For overall service, location and quality/quantity of food. It was a standard 3/5 but oh that burger.....(drifts off into burger dreamland)"}
{"text":"Went in there for a late night drink (around 8:30pm is when we arrived). Seated ourselves, service was a little slow even though it was empty. Got the brownie dessert, which was great. My friends all had beer from tap (I was designated driver, so I didn't drink... got a hot chocolate) and all of them had diarrhea from it. No, it was not the food we ate before coming here because I was fine and we all had the same meal beforehand (ramen). Something is wrong with the beer on tap. Please don't order it."}
{"text":"Came here today to sun myself on the patio and enjoy the 20+ degree weather. The service on the patio was good and they half half-price apps between 3-6 every day. The Voodoo Chicken fingers and Chicken Qasadilla (sic) were quite good, better than the usual pup grub. Beer selection was meh, and they didn't have their house beer on the patio."}
{"text":"This pub has the best roof top patio in the city. There is good service and pricing is very fair. The food choices is typical pub grub but done very well. Definitely a favourite spot of mine. Duely note they don't offer pitchers of beer just pints."}
{"text":"I wanted to try their rack of ribs special which was advertised all over the place the day we were there, but they were sold out by 7pm. If you no longer have the special by dinner time you should consider erasing it off the board and not give people false hope. As a result I didn't get anything to eat and was extremely hangry. I didn't much care for the decor either. Safe to say I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"I was on Bloor St., doing my regular boutique shopping with a friend and decided to have a drink here at the roof top patio. The walk up this place is well worh it, you see a great view of buildings on Bloor. My first impression of the roof top patio was that it looks like a backyard party, having the sun shining and the music pumping, it was fun. Now th best part, is how cheap beer/alcohol is at this place, your saving close to $2-3 dollars per beer/glass of wine. So most people were just grabbing drinks and enjoying the weather. At these places you find your own seating which I like since I dont like to be burned out in the sun. Our server was really friendly and never seemed rushed even though she had a lot more other people to serve. After having a ceasar to drink, I happened to get hungry and so did my friend so I grabbed the Bbq Brisket with cheddar and a side green salad w/ poppy seed dressing and my friend grabbed the turkey brie sandwhich w/ a side navy bean vegetable soup. Both of our entrées were delicious and filled me right up. Our server came to check up on us often and we really enjoyed the vibe of Paupers Pub. I will definitely come back ;)"}
{"text":"It's okay. Thats all I can really say. I've been here a few times because I am a Pure Pwnage fan and there's always rumors circling at the screenings that the cast will show up there later on that night... they never do.   Service has always been friendly, sometimes slow though. Washrooms are nice. Atmosphere is classic bar feeling, not so much a pub.   Not my first choice of bars to visit when in the Annex."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times for meetings, dinners, and events. My favourite thing is the really comfortable atmosphere. It's got a warm glow, lots of wood: it's welcoming.   The service is also fun, with lots of smiles and the efficiency to back it up. The food's tasty and well-prepared, too -- pub fare done nicely to comfort and warm you. They have particularly good chicken fingers (Hey... I like chicken fingers!) and I have also enjoyed the nachos and the stuffed burger recently. All worth getting!  I tend to find myself here in winter and fall more than spring and summer, but they also have a cool rooftop patio if you're there in warmer months.  One thing to note is that, like many older Toronto buildings, this spot is not accessible as far as I know. You may be able to get through the door, but washrooms are down or up stairs and there are stairs to the dining areas as well, for the most part. This isn't unique about Paupers so I am not dinging them for it, but it is worth mentioning if this is of concern to you."}
{"text":"How do I rate my experience?  Picture this - you're the uncool kids in high school and you're looking for a seat in the cafeteria and all the cool kids are looking at you like you have leprosy. That was our current experience.  From the bartender who in his best condescending voice told me that they had \"plenty\" of room at the back for 7 people, to two female servers who winced and grimaced through every transaction with their fake-as-fuck smile plastered over their face, followed by the tsunami of wind that came from every exaggerated eye-roll after asking for reasonable things like a straw for a drink, this whole experience was just. total. shit. I mean - unsalvageable shit. Honestly, for a restaurant that was 15% full, you think some customers would be treated with at least a modicum of cordiality, but alas, no. We spent 2 hours feeling like a grave burden on two very under-worked waitresses that, really, should have taken a moment to realize the context of the situation.  You serve, we buy; you serve well, we buy more.  As you can imagine, we bought very little and left quickly, despite the great appetizer deal at 50% off before 6. Again, if you have such a deal, naturally we're going to take advantage of it, so if that's what you're pissy about, take it up with your boss who made the promotion.  All in all... if you're a university student with low standards and a focus on getting fed and drunk, visit paupers.  If you have any sense of being treated like a person, go somewhere else.  (our visit: Sunday, October 2nd, 3pm - servers, 2 young white females, reddish hair, and a whole lot of attitude plastered very thinly beneath a false veneer of hospitality).  (ADDED: In response to the owner's comment, we DID speak to the bartender, asking about the poor service and he was as flippant as the waitresses.)"}
{"text":"This is a cool pub. The vibe is relaxed and the server was very friendly.   They have these awesome red booths. On Sunday the place was not too busy. We came here strictly for drinks. They had a good deal for $5 Caesars or $4 mixed drinks.   I ordered the whiskey sour. I can't say it was the most amazing cocktail I've had, but for $4 it was worth it.   It's a cool place to grab a drink and hangout with friends."}
{"text":"A fan of the Pauper's! Yes, it is nothing especial when compared to other pubs from afar, except that in fact make it a relatively cool locale when you add the sum of its parts.   A-) This place is pretty big. It's three floors of fun. First floor is the regular bar. The second floor is also a regular bar, except with a grand piano, a dance floor and a back area to book if you want/need the space. The third floor is an awesome little patio, worth spending an evening during a cool summer night.  Now, as some of you may know, I run a few social groups plus Toronto's largest Spanish speaking peer-to-peer language group, and I want/need the space. (For more on these and other shameless, self-promotional plugs, please check my profile :-p)  B-) The relatively cheap beer. I mean, let's not kid ourselves, most people don't go to pubs for the decour or the high end food.   C-) The really great patio! I have uploaded a photo or two so take a look.   D-) The pub is a tight ship. Yes, there might be the odd hiccup but the night manager, Jose is very attentive and willing to work with you to make sure events go without any hitches  E-) Special pricing on most nights! Which goes back to B-)  F-) If you are interested you can catch hockey/baseball/whatever games on one of their many large screens, which depending on who is playing, they may have drink specials based on that! Like cheaper pitchers if the Leafs are playing in the playoffs. Again, that goes back to B-)  G-) Live music on Thursday nights on the second floor!   H... I am losing track here... ;-) The piano! ...I like grand pianos and I get to play on it from time to time.    All in all, an institution of the Annex if you are willing to go for something more straight down the middle and laid back than say, posh-lite Insomnia, or dirt-hole The Beer Station."}
{"text":"I've been here over the years and have had large group meet ups on the outdoor patio. Tonight my friend and I had dinner and caught up on life. Mozz sticks for apps. I had the Tennessee Jack burger which was delicious, I did have to ask for the fries to be sent back as I had asked for well done. My friend at their turkey and brie sandwich which she said was really good but the soup was not great and she sent it back for fries."}
{"text":"I love Pauper's.  It's so great because unlike the vast majority of pubs in the hood, it's not always filled with skanky college kids with too-short skirts and shaggy hair.  It's more about the old men watching sports during the day and there's a younger crowd for events upstairs and enjoying the patio outside.   It's great for a quiet beer or pub fare during the day (there's wifi) but it's also a good, not-too-loud pub to go with a couple peeps to catch up.   Good place.   The waiters aren't particularly friendly, but it's alright-totally doesn't ruin the place whatsoever.  Still worth checking out."}
{"text":"great location right in the hart of the annex.  lots of seating inside and a huge rooftop patio!  regular pub food.  been here many times and will come back again!"}
{"text":"Pauper's was a local favourite where friends and I would meet up and enjoy some basic pub food and a pint; family from out of town would almost always want Pauper's for a quick, satisfying bite before a night out and the rooftop patio was a nice getaway from busy Bloor street below.   All of these kept me going back to Pauper's, along with its familiarity, friendly service and good grub, until recently. Somewhere between spring and summer this year, Pauper's changed.   The menu is different and the food isn't as good as it once was. I haven't been the only one to notice. Several others have commented on the lack of quality in the once satisfying meals. I hate to say it, but Pauper's is no longer the great place it was."}
{"text":"I'm really up and down about this one.  There are definitely pluses and minues to this place.  People are all about the rootop patio.  It's pretty nice, but always swamped.  And like others have said here, its nothing special.  The food I would say is above average for pub fare.  Had the cajun burger and fries, and was pleased.  However....they dont serve pitchers...  Also, the service can be pretty awful.  Our waitress had to ask each one of us to repeat at least part of our order and seemed to be dozing off while we were speaking to her.  Her air-headedness definitely detracted from the experience."}
{"text":"Upon our arrival, we werr neglected for 30minutes by the waitress and when we finally caught her attention we were treated with attitude. After attempting to take our orders, not only were we meet with more attitude but she also didnt even know their own menu that well. To get things going, we ordered some finger food and to our utter disgust there were hair inside our food (after taking forever to arrive) and when we raised the concern to the waitress she implied it was our own."}
{"text":"Not too shabby, this is a huge multi-level pub with tons of seating, live piano on Friday and very comfy seats.  Service is decent and the beer list is pretty good. I like the place, but the Hubster doesn't, so it's out."}
{"text":"Updated: We didn't come here for the live piano or music. We came for the blue jays game advertised outside. Note: volume is turned on, on the second floor. I wish I went upstairs instead of staying on the main floor. The place itself is quite big, looks very similar to the Madison's Pub but with an older crowd. We ordered the side salad, burger, and wings. Wings are good, I wouldn't order the salad and the burger next time though. Our server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Nice place with nice service. Food is OK. They lack espresso coffee."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place sucks! The waitress gave us attitude, rolled her eyes at us, and ignored us after making eye contact with us several times. The food was tasteless and cold to say the least, all THREE orders. We asked them to reheat my friend's pork chops and after 10 minutes of ignoring us after calling for our waitress, they took her plate and 'reheated' it. I don't know how but they came back 10 minutes later with the food just as cold as it was. Honestly ridiculous.  We asked our waitress to get us water after being ignored for the better part of the evening and she returned as we were leaving with just 1 glass of water. WHO DOES THAT?  Honestly, save your $$ and go elsewhere this place is definitely not worth it!   The $5 you pay at Elfurniture Warehouse across the street will get you better service and quality of food."}
{"text":"I've been to Paupers many times.  They generally have good customer service and a nice atmosphere.  The menu is ok and they often have deals (ie. a specials menu) which make it quite affordable.  It isn't normally overly packed so you can usually get a seat, even on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pauper's for years, but it's more out of convenience than desire. It's large enough for you to usually be able to find a seat, but that tends to spread the service rather thin.   I never know what to order. The menu is a sprawling mess and I'm never sure what's going to be prepared fresh, or what's going to be thawed out, pre breaded, and revolting. The other day I had the Turkey and Brie sandwich and it was pretty tasty. If you don't know what to order, order that. I wish they would chop the menu down so they could make all the food this kind of quality.  For some reason, the main area is carpeted, so it stinks all the bloody time. The tables have hanging lamps that sit at a very awkward level, and they're covered in dusty old lady fabric and macrame. If they ditched the carpet and annoying dust clump covered lights, it might be more appealing.   Service is hit and miss. There are a few very good staff, but for the most part, you'll be chasing down someone to get anything."}
{"text":"A  nice rooftop patio with food that I remember being better than I expected in a large quantity as well. And like Lauren mentions they do have good drink specials and the bartenders I've had have always been the right amount of friendly.   I've been here for large group events as well and have had a chance to sample their party platters and all the platters I've had (which is most on the menu) have been big in quantity and tasty too.   They've got a nice set up of TVs for sporting events too if that's your thing as well.   All in all I do enjoy Paupers and would recommend it if you're in the area, or especially if you're coming out of the Bloor Cinema as it's right across the street!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this bar. It's usually packed but the wait staff is friendly and attentive. Best of all, in addition to the large beer selection, they also have food. The sweet potato fries are quite excellent. The kitchen is open late which is super helpful for those of us who get hungry after a night out at a concert or a movie. Pauper's Pub has a very lively atmosphere, comfortable seating, and is definitely a fun spot to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I was within walking area of the Annex and seeing as how it's patio season now I decided to try out one of the places on the list of patio places put out recently by Evelyn.  I was here early for lunch, right when it opened and during the week this place isn't so busy during opening I'd imagine over say a weekend.  Still this place is really large and while I could see the rooftop patio sort of from the street, it's not open at lunch.  They do have a side patio facing Lippincott which is just fine.  I'll start off with the check in offer.  I'm not sure if this is part of the patio season or not but the wording may need work.  The check in tag line reads,  \"50% off Your First Check In, Check In here to unlock this offer\".    OK so while I didn't expect 50% off my entire bill I was expecting a wee bit more than what the offer REALLY was.  For anybody that checks in you have to slide the offer, actually check in with or without comments and you have 4 hours to use the offer.  The thing is the tag line is ambiguous to say the least.  The actual offer is 50% off a STARTER (app) with the purchase of a beverage.  So the gaping misunderstanding could be that there is an assumption of 50% off something but not specific until you actually check in.  You can't really see what the offer is until you physically check in and you can't check in unless you are within proximity of the business.  The only benefit of this check in is that it would trump their regular same offer but that is only valid between certain hours (normally not lunch time).  When I mentioned the check in offer the server wasn't sure how they would do it because they normally only give specials during their happy hour.  She said she'd speak to the manager or somebody.  She said they are always doing something but they aren't made aware of these offers.  Regardless of the check in the place is a very accommodating size and a nice feel to it.  It does feel a little divey inside and outdated but that is part of the charm of it.  I saw a photo coming back from the patio and the place was once a CIBC back in the day.  It is a really nice structure and it has a large solid footprint as well.  I had ordered for my wife that was meeting me for lunch.  I had an Amsterdam Boneshaker to start.  Honestly I felt the pour was short.  It was served in a small snifter type glass but I really didn't think it was anywhere near a pint size if it was full but this had so much head on it.  I should have said something but I didn't.  I just wasn't in the mood.  I had ordered the smoked turkey with brie on a ciabatta and side salad for her and a cheeseburger with fries for myself.  I also ordered the onion rings as a starter but everything basically came out at once. I have to say the food was really good.  I'd give a 4 for the food alone.  The burger I had wasn't frozen.  On the menu it said it had 3 ounces of cheese on it and melted it probably had more.  The onion straws are a nice touch.  I love crunchiness when I can get it.  The onion rings were good too, nothing too out of the ordinary but a solid starter.  My wife enjoyed her food and saved the other half of her sandwich for later in the day.    Overall the experience was ok.  The server wasn't aware of the check in offer or wasn't even sure if she could honor it at first.  It turns out they were able to honor it.  On the receipt where they applied the discount it was marked \"Four Square\" tsk tsk!  So I saved a whopping 3 bucks on what was listed as a 50% off my first check in.    Regardless of the check in the service was also ok, the space is a nice space but the food was great.  The drink was good but I think I should have had a little more... I have a photo of the drink as it was served with the amount of head on it.  If I'm wrong about the volume of this, please somebody let me know.  I'm not an expert in snifters and they are strange to me all around."}
{"text":"I must first state that this revised review and rating has little to do with Paupers, I still quite enjoy it, but more to do with their strange choice of security.  I believe that they contract out security on the weekends ( I may be wrong), and I hope I am, because the treatment that I personally received from security here was nothing short of appalling.  I may be dating myself, but I am well past the legal age, and like most I'm sure, do get somewhat flattered when asked for ID.  On the rare occasion that I do get asked I usually make a light joke, present it my ID, and then keep reminding the person or people that I'm with that I got ID'd and they didn't. This usually wears pretty thin by nights end.  So all joking aside.  We went to Paupers on a Friday night after a concert at the Phoenix, and as we got inside the front door we were immediately asked for our ID's.  As I have mentioned I sometimes make light of such situations, and did so as I opened my wallet to produce my ID,  the security officer asked me \"how much I had had to drink,\" and then proceeded to instruct me to walk a straight line heel to toe.  I laughed because I thought there may be a hidden camera capturing this spectacle, yet security stood stone-faced and told me that if I didn't walk heel to toe in the small confines of the front entrance I wouldn't be admitted in! As we were already meeting people inside and it would have been somewhat of a herculean effort to try and coordinate alternate plans, I had little choice but to walk three feet in a straight line back and forth, back and forth, until he was satisfied that I could do so.  We were then let in, but not without a totally sour taste in our collective mouth's.  I found this experience to be totally humiliating, unnecessary and somewhat abusive.  We will not be back on any weekend!!!"}
{"text":"We were walking along Bloor street and decided to check out the rooftop patio at Pauper's Pub.  The vibe is awesome and the servers were great; they had a good deal on a bucket of 5 coronas (25 bucks), but the downside was the one appetizer we got: the nachos.  To be honest, if nachos are priced around 16 bucks, I'd expect a lot more (in both quality and size).  Although the place seems busy (at least on the rooftop patio), food should be served in a timely manner.  When the nachos arrived, you could tell it had been sitting for a while -- the cheese wasn't stringy, rather, it had already solidified.  I would have been pretty cheesed if I had to pay full price -- thankfully they had a 50% off an appetizer for a first check-in.  What's a plus for this place? They actually had single bathrooms upstairs in the rooftop patio space! Definitely a plus.  Would I come back? Perhaps for their daily drink deals, and perhaps their 1/2 priced apps before 6pm.  Otherwise? Probably not."}
{"text":"We came in here on a Saturday. The rooftop patio was open so we head up there. They had a special on long island iced tea. They also have great beer on tap along with the usual. Half price appetizers from 3pm-6pm. Overall great place to meet friends. Definitely head up there to their patio during summer time."}
{"text":"I would go here again for sure! Went here a few nights ago to watch the Leafs game and it was pretty awesome. Beer pitchers are CHEAP which is great. They have two patios, one rooftop which is really cool but small and their ground level patio which is bigger. We sat on the rooftop before the game started and had some apps. We ordered wings which tasted pretty good but received 7 wings which I found a lil'weird. A lb of wings is normally 9-10, from my experience anyway. Because I was short changed 2 wings, I was in a slight foul mood. Lol. I was hungry, okay! Overall, this place is a great pub. It has many levels to choose from and the food is alright, it's pub food."}
{"text":"Took advantage of late night drinking and eating on the rooftop patio just before it got too cold out! The first floor seating space was completely filled with college kids, which was not a factor when the roof was calling me. There was hardly anybody up there. It's pretty spacious, but smoking is allowed, so I had to get up and move upon realizing I need to breathe. The ambiance is casual, an enclave escape above the bustling Bloor St. I can't comment on the food yet, as all I ordered was nachos, and they were just that. Good spot for meeting someone new, or catching up with an old friend! Now go do that!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, very different experiences both of these. First time was great. Sat on the patio and the waitress was super nice and when we moved inside it was just as excellent. Fast and efficient.  Second time the service was definitley slower and not as polite. But still not too bad. Decent prices, but one of many pubs that doesn't really shine brighter than others."}
{"text":"The pub itself was clean and well laid out but our group had the rudest and most unpleasant waitress which lead to us leaving earlier than anticipated and heading to the Green Room down the street. I ordered a Tom Collins which looked and tasted like extremely sour kool-aid, I would not order that drink again. I might go back in hopes that I will get a better waitress next time as I did enjoy the actual space, it's like a smaller and cleaner version of The Madison Avenue Pub down the street."}
{"text":"Pauper's is a great place to go for food and beer between 3:00 and 6:00 -- starters (including good wings, sliders, and house salad) are 1/2 price, and pints of beer are $1 less than the normal price. Service is good (on the main floor and patio, at least.)"}
{"text":"Shortest review I'll ever write.  Eeeehhh."}
{"text":"The rooftop patio is great, have an awesome view of the city.  Food is pretty good too. Just shared apps, the Thai chicken and calamari.  Thai chicken is three large breaded pieces of chicken, in a spicy/sweet Thai sauce... Very good.  Calamari is breaded in something wonderful because they were melting in my mouth!!  The vibe was good, 25's to 40's crowd, good mix of music.  Fun place to start your night on the weekend, or for a night cap during the week."}
{"text":"A great hidden pub in the Bathurst and Bloor area that offers a lot of cheap food and drinks specials. Fantastic place to dine out with friends on a budget and getting bang for your buck. The pub also has a rooftop patio and a regular patio as well. My friends and I sat on the patio on a gorgeous Summer day and ordered a bunch of appetizers. They usually have a featured beer on tap for their special and half-priced appetizers/starters between 3-6PM every day and other featured daily specials during the week. We ordered the voodoo chicken fingers, nachos supreme, the Mediterranean flatbreads and roaster wings. Their starters were all quite delicious and very appetizing. My favourite one was probably the voodoo chicken fingers which were saucy, flavorful and a bit of kick in it from the thai sauce. All the starters were fairly good portions including the nachos. A nice place to dine at or to have a drink if you are in the area. One of my new favourite places for sure and would be back over and over again! Highly recommended place to come here for good food at an affordable price that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Whenever I need a quick lunch I come here and grab a special and it turns out it's usually quite good. Menu itself is a bit long too many items. Specials are usually done with a lot more care and turn out alot better."}
{"text":"The only thing I would change is opening the 2nd floor a little bit earlier. I like it better than the first floor, more room for bigger groups and it just feels cozier to me.  Their spicy sausage pasta is AMAZING, good selection of beer, the live music is a nice touch. Another thing I love about it is that it doesn't get too loud like a lot of the bars in the area."}
{"text":"Overpriced food ! I ordered fish and looks like its stale and cooked using extra oil which you don't want. The beer is good and good patio view though."}
{"text":"This is one of the several bars that seems to benefit from the spill over at the Madison and the Brunswick House.  They type of people you'll find there, are the type of people you'll find at Pauper's.  The clientele seems to be comprised mostly of college kids, and locals looking for a drink.  The bar itself is a multi level pub which includes a rooftop patio that is very popular in the summertime.  The food is standard pub fare, as is the beer.  The big annoying this about the beer is that pitchers are only sold during football and hockey games.  As soon as the game ends, so do the pitchers.  Depending on which floor you're on defines what kind of environment you get.  It's mostly the same, but differences like a live piano and/or guitar player on the second floor, vs a lack of such things on the first floor will possibly change the experience.  If you're looking for a quiet(er) drink, stay off the second floor, as Joe Acoustic with guitar and list of Top 40 covers will really challenge your ability to have a regular conversation with your friends."}
{"text":"Wicked roof top patio.  I can't give it 4 stars because i didn't try the food.  Just came here for some beers on the roof but if you haven't been it is a nice spot."}
{"text":"I usually end up at Paupers only because it's located in a good spot. While there's nothing ostensibly wrong with it, I can't say anything about the food has ever really jumped out at me. And I've had experiences with really awesome service, but I've had just a couple more experiences where the service was pretty slow and inattentive. It always seemed to be under-staffing, but who knows?  There ARE times where I seek Paupers out, and that's because of the awesome rooftop patio. Certainly one of the best views in Toronto. That said, the last time I made it up there, there were a number of pigeons hanging around the overhang and bombing bird crap danger close.  EDIT: Thanks for the reply Janet! Can't wait for patio season :)"}
{"text":"Great pub atmosphere and the Piano Bar is great on Fridays headed by Matthew Campbell. Alot less crazy then The Brunswick or The Madison, Pauper's is the alternative for the 25-plus crowd who want to get krunky, but not over-the-top pukey like at the others.  Great Voodoo chicken fingers as well- yumskees!"}
{"text":"I had heard that the wings here were underrated and very good. As a big wing fan - I was very pleased to have tried the wings here and my entire group really enjoyed them!  I'm also quite a fan of delirium and finding out that they had delirium on tap as well was a terrific surprise!  I haven't tried much of their other food but the menu looks great and I will surely be back."}
{"text":"Size and location and great. Several floors and a rooftop open patio are great on warm days and nights. I went several times last year but have always only drank beers and such. Good selection and to be expected with a bar of such size. I've always been in groups of at least 6-15 people and we've never had an issue (to my knowledge) with paying bills, and splitting. And that is saying something since people come and go throughout the nights we go. I ordered food for the first time last week and had Calamari. It was 'meh'. Had better, seen better, tasted better. After I ordered about 4 others did as well. I pretty much wished I had ordered anything else. But something are hit or miss. But still, this is a not a place you go to to really enjoy calamari I could tell clearly from it composition, consistency and taste. Get a burger, plate of fries and make it a regular food night.   I don't have my usual format for this review, but that's mostly because I think the experience was so meh/blah. Not bad, not great, all about the company you keep by your side. I had great friends so I had a good time. Our waitress was attentive last time I went so that is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday after work hours and was glad that this place wasn't too packed. We were on the ground-floor patio split among 3 tables, since our party was fairly large. The half-price starters from 3-6pm were great to split. Sweet potato fries were definitely the best in our opinion. The rest of their menu didn't seem that exciting or special though.  Service was great and I'll probably come back, to be honest, mainly for their starters!"}
{"text":"Don't recommend coming here if you have food allergies or sensitivities. I asked the waitress if an item on the menu had an allergen and she said the manager was too busy to check. I eat at restaurants all the time and never experienced a place where they were \"too busy\" to check if a food item had an allergen. A chef should know what they cook so this made me question where their food comes from. It was also not very busy..."}
{"text":"Just a normal pub.  3 stars because of the decent drink prices and the rooftop  patio otherwise this is a 2 star place.  Personally I wasn't that impressed with the patio. It was crowded and the tables are mostly cheap Canadian tire plastic furniture.  Pros Cheap prices Cool rooftop patio.  Cons Crowded patio Uncomfortable chairs"}
{"text":"4 stars for the older decor, interior. Wings, fries very salty and small for 15 bucks. Lots of booths and good for small and medium groups."}
{"text":"Upside, amazing patios (up stairs and downstairs) downside, food is gross and waitstaff can be slooow. But the patios are fantastic. I can see having a party in the upstairs one and a group of us did not leave the street one for almost 2 hours, it was gorgeous in the shade. Only for booze."}
{"text":"The best part of Paupers is the rooftop patio. It's big and, if you avoid the high tops at the very back (I think there's kitchen exhaust or something coming out of there - it smells), a pretty solid place to spend some time drinking beer. There's no real view, but sometimes it's good enough just being outside.  Service has fluctuated between awesome and average, so I think it's very much luck of the draw. The ladies bathrooms have never been the best but on my last visit 2 of 4 stalls on the second floor were completely unusable due to dirt or the back of the toilet tank being on the seat (no idea what that was about).  Food is average. When I read the menu, however, I feel like I'm being nickle and dimed to death based on the pricing and the set-up. Maybe I'm being oversensitive, but it just seems a lot more blatant than other places.  Go in with middling expectations, enjoy the rooftop patio, and take advantage of some great outdoor drinking space in the Annex!"}
{"text":"I came in here with a few friends to grab some drinks and chill. We sat at the bar and ordered some beers and chatted. I looked around and saw a lot of younger 20 year olds doing the same. The place looked like an old, but once was, upscale pub. Theres red leather booths, red velvet stools and creeking old wood floors. I kinda liked it here. We had about ten drinks between us four and the bill came out to $60! Pretty cheap."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto on a trip and wanted to walk somewhere close to our AirBNB so we found this place.  It was by far the worst service I have ever received. Server clearly didn't wanna be there. Took 20 minutes to get created and we were about to leave. Wish we had! Took another 15-20 min to get waters, never got the beer I ordered and when I asked she said \"oh we're out of the one\". Food came fast and hot was the only saving grace.  Watched the server ignore others and just stand at the bar computer. And it's awkward that they stand there while you have to punch in your tip on the card reader. Would never waste my money here again."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a smaller version of Madison Avenue Pub which I really liked. They both have that cozy, warm Annex atmosphere that is super nice to simply chill/eat with friends. They also have daily specials (such as $20/$25 wine nights on Friday!). I was digging the live music Friday night, mad props to the band! The reason for the 3 stars is because our server was friendly but she seemed a bit overwhelmed tbh and she forgot about my drinks twice. Perhaps they're a bit understaffed? Idk, but I did enjoy my time here and will definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Toronto, I went to this place a lot.  Like too much a lot.  Probably because I had a friend working there who through the wonders of staff prices was able to hook us up with booze to the point of discomfort.  Paupers has not changed, but I like to think that I've matured a bit since the days of Why-Am-I-Having-Another-Jager-Shot?  Even so, this is a place I love to meet up with friends for a quick drink or a pub meal.  Affiliated with the Madison Pub (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/madison-ave-pub-and-restaurant-toronto), this definitely still has the attraction to a younger crowd looking for cheap food and drink before the night out.  Located at Bloor and Bathurst, it makes it a great starting point and meeting place before carrying on for a show at Lee's Palace (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/lees-palace-toronto).  Admittedly, this is chiefly what I use this place for.  It is a pub not dissimilar to the feel of the Madison with warm wood, high ceilings, carpet, deep booths, and multiple levels.  In the summer you can enjoy one of its patios, either at street level, or atop the pub itself.  Arguably, this is one of the best patios out there, providing seclusion, distance from the street, and thanks to the absence of skyscrapers one of the most stunning views of the city.  The beer taps are plentiful, the menu more than ample, the food as tasty as your usual pub fare.  What is nice to see is that favourites found on the menu at the Madison have found their way onto the Paupers menu, thereby not forcing you to subway your way one stop just so you can have some Voodoo Chicken.  A great place to meet, or wind down the workday or night out."}
{"text":"There's just something so refreshingly comfortable and unpretentious about Pauper's. The place looks like it hasn't been renovated in at least 20 years and that's undoubtedly a big part of its charm. The red décor and plentiful booths contribute heavily to its exceedingly comfortable atmosphere, and though the food is average (at best), I'll keep returning for the low-key, non-hip vibe.  On this particular visit, my eye was drawn to the daily special: a burger stuffed with cheese and jalapeno. Stuffed burgers are notoriously difficult to get right, but I'll admit I was curious to see if Pauper's could pull it off.  Nope.  It's not terrible. I ate the whole thing, admittedly. And the first couple of bites were quite tasty, to be sure, with the oozing cheese and jalapeno mix certainly as irresistible as I might've hoped. But by the time you get to the middle of the burger, the filling is almost completely gone and you're left with a dry, overcooked patty. This thing required a heck of a lot of chewing power. (The accompanying fries were pretty much terrible, which didn't help matters. They clearly emerged from a bag out of the freezer. They were hot, at least.)  I will nevertheless be back at Pauper's sooner rather than later. But maybe one day I'll learn my lesson and just stick with booze while I'm there."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 2/5 Location: 3/5   In the heart of the Toronto Annex, this place is perfect for those Friday night patio hangouts with friends. You're within walking distance from the subway, restaurants, and plenty of entertainment venues. They have a patio on the side with a street view and a roof deck.  There are lots of great beers on tap for the beer lovers out there. When I went I got the Canadian burger (it has bacon!) with a side of house salad. The salad was a bit bland but the burger was fantastic. The service was slow and they screwed up on a few of our orders (sides and omissions)."}
{"text":"Probably more like 3.5 Stars but gave it 5 to help make up for the clearly bitter people who gave it 1 Star because their small, one track minds were offended in some way. These simpletons should not be allowed to vote and are likely the reason we have a Liberal government as they just can't comprehend the bigger picture.  Had the Fish & chips which is made fresh in house and was a very tender and thick portion.  My only complaint would be the mozzarella sticks which were also very good but 5 of them for $10.25 is rather pricey, luckily I checked in here which unlocks 50% off appetizer offer.   The people complaining about the ambience, decor and red valour should stick to Harvey's, that's more their style."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Service is terrible. They couldnt care less. We waited for 15 minutes and no one even bothered to ask us if we wanted anything (not even a glass of water).   Tried to flag some of the wait staff down but were totally ignored. Walked out. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"This is a really nice pub. The atmosphere is great, friendly staff. Their beer selection is average, food is average. Would go again :)."}
{"text":"Met up with a pal here on Saturday night. Right in the Annex, you're within walking distance from the subway, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Paupers is a casual bar with a great selection of beers and a pretty good food menu. The drinks here are quite reasonable for Toronto standards. I had a bottle of Desperado for $6. There's a lot of seating so it's a great place to meet a group of friends; there are also a lot of booths so you can meet up with a friend or two.   Bonus - Check in with Yelp and you get 50% off of one appetizer.  Good for: drinks, pub grub, groups"}
{"text":"Key Features: Show up between 3pm and 6pm  Monday - Friday and the rating is bumped up to a 4.  Half price appetizers is an inconceivable deal.  Located near Honest Ed's, it's tough to find an appropriately priced pint of beer.  Paupers has you covered.    Free Wi-fi (and FourSquare deals) can help take some of the bite out of your cheque.    The food is alright, the beer is cheap.  You're at a pub.  What more could you possibly want?  As mentioned in the Key Features - show up during happy hour, and there's just no reason to go anywhere else, after work."}
{"text":"I think Pauper's has deteriorated over time. I've been going there for maybe five years with a certain group of friends who meet there every month.  1. The menu used to be very very affordable. It's gone up in price and I think the portion sizes have gone down. They've stopped adding little extras to the food, like a pickle with a sandwich and fries.  2. There used to be regular wait staff who knew us. Now I hardly see the same face twice even though I'm there the same hours every month. I don't know if this is high staff turnover or just shift shuffling.  3. Last time we were there, even though our group had a standing reservation (and had done for ten years!), they'd given our space to someone else. We did complain, and we're going to try again in January and see if they remember who we are.  4. It was 7:30 pm and they were out of cider? Bwah?  One more bad thing, but this is not a change, just the way things always are: it's not accessible *at all*. There are a few steps to get up to the main floor from the sidewalk, stairs up to the upstairs lounge and rooftop patio, and narrow, steep stairs down to the washrooms which are in the basement. Hell, I wouldn't navigate those stairs if I were drunk or low on blood sugar, or if my feet were bigger than they are.  Okay, now the good stuff: the food is really, really good. The grilled cheese sandwich on egg bread is made with real cheese, not plastic American cheeselike food product. The soups are fantastic and so is anything deep-fried. Sometimes all I want are onion rings.  I love the decor too -- English-pub-style with plump red velvet seats, stamped tin ceilings, wood and brass fixtures. It really is an old building that's been well-kept, and looks like it (and this would also be the reason for the lack of accessibility).  No matter how crowded this place is, I have never been unable to have a conversation with people at the same table and I've never had to yell to be heard. The acoustics are good. Whether you want to go watch a game or just sit with friends and talk, it's the right place."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times on the roof top patio. Its cute! Sometimes it can be really crowded though.   I went there last Sunday with a few friends to the roof top patio. The patio was less than 1/2 full and the service was TERRIBLE.   I arrived after my friends, but was not served upon at all. I had to borrow a menu from the table next to us. I ordered the veg quesadilla and about 30min later I was brought a veg wrap with fries.  Conversation is as follows: Me: \"I ordered the veg quesadilla, is this it?\" Server: \"yes\"  Me: \"Oh I thought they were flat\"  Server: \"oh we roll them up here\"  Woman @ table next to me: \"that is NOT a quesadilla, don't take food you didn't order.\" They take it back. 10 min later they bring me a chicken quessadilla. I send that back and 5min later I finally get my veg quessadilla (on the house).  We were there for over an hour on a half empty patio and not once did our server ask us if we wanted drink or refill. Had to chase her down for everything.  So in summary, go for the patio and not for the food or service!"}
{"text":"I like going here with my friends for the roof top patio but it gets pretty crowded pretty early on in the evening. It's good for the summer.  I also like going there for their indoors. I've spent considerable time here and have never been disappointed. They have nice banker lamps on the first floor which adds gentility to the establishment despite the hordes of students thronging here.  They have a piano on the 2nd floor which adds to the charm. Their servers have amazing memory, our server remembered what I had ordered three weeks after I had gone their initially!  On the 1st Wednesday of each month Paupers has $3 drink and food specials! You gotta get there fast!   A great neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for relaxing late night snack or drinks.  Pauper's has great wine prices in general and they have a great wine deal on Friday's. They also have a decent beer list.  The food is pretty decent but it's your basic pub/bar food. You have a choice of a wide range of deep-fried foods and burgers/sandwiches.   One thing that I wish, is that they would actually seat people properly or put up a sign that says 'seat yourself'. The service is friendly, but it seems to be at its best when I have males with me.  I wish it was a bit more consistent and not dependent on whether my company is attractive enough for the the waitresses.  In all honesty, there is nothing too special about this place. It's a decent place to grab food and get your pre-drink on before heading out, but I wouldn't take my family here."}
{"text":"Great old school style pub to grab a celebratory drink with mates after a league game, and that's just what I did! They were easily able to seat a group of 10 of us without a reservation in the back of the pub where the darts boards are located.   DRINKS: They had a small selection of beers for a pub (hence the 3 stars), but it's not bad of a selection nonetheless. I was a little disappointed when they didn't have any guinness on tap, but they did recommend a Murphy's stout which was superb.   Overall, this is a great place to grab a drink with a group of friends, but don't expect anything special or over the top here."}
{"text":"Exactly what the other bed reviews said happened, happened to me. I read the reviews before coming here so I was keeling and eye out. I went in there on a Friday afternoon/early evening. The waitress took our drink orders fairly quickly and delivered them quickly as well. That was the only decent thing about my time here. I wanted to order food and tried to make it obvious (looking at the menu then placing down at the edge of the table, making eye contact with server) but our waitress completely ignored me. I had to flag down another waitress to order my burger. My food came quickly but with no cutlery, I had to flag down yet another waitress for that. The burger was fine I guess. Then we had to flag down our waitress for the bill (recurring theme here huh?) I paid in cash and needed change,  and she couldn't for the life of her do the simple math in her head which felt very much like a tactic to get a bigger tip. Unfortunately for me it worked because i eventually said \"just give me five and you keep the rest.\" This place sucks, big time."}
{"text":"After coming to visit from the states, we decided to stop on into this pub and have some drinks. Upon getting in, we were asked for our order and then asked for IDs, we all presented him with our US state IDs, and the bartender went to whisper to the other staff members. He then came back and threw the ID he had and said he couldn't serve us because they were fake. He then dismissed us, and even after I told him I could present him with a passport and other forms of identification he ignored my party and I. I have never felt this level of disrespect and needless to say discrimination. They were so rude and disrespectful towards us, I will never be returning back or ever recommending this place."}
{"text":"Come here for the rooftop patio and the rooftop patio only. I would even wait until seats open up on the rooftop.  Food here is cheeeaaapppp. They even have cheap wing nights, I think it's something like 25cent wings or half price wings? I can't really remember. What I do remember is eating a lot of them and not having to pay much but that's a different story. Even if you don't get the wings, all the other food on the menu is cheap but not necessarily good. Food here is miss and slightly miss so don't expect much on quality here.   Service... well they can be assholes. Most of the time they are absolute dolls. Many times dolls though. Especially on the rooftop. I don't know what it is about the rooftop that makes them so nice. Maybe they think they are on top of the world because they are literally on top of it all. Whatever, the service is hit and miss. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes mean, sometimes nice.... hit and miss.   What makes this place good is the drink prices. Drinks are CHEAP!   Overall, it's nothing special. Great for the rooftop patio during summer nights and cheap drinks to keep you cool. Not the best pub around but one of the best rooftops. I always have fun here. Just don't expect anything extraordinary."}
{"text":"Came in with some friends after a show at Lee's, had some cold beer with wings and they were really good. The wings weren't the best but I still enjoyed them. The price wasn't very bad as it was well within budget for the food we got. Onion rings were great and..service was good too no real complaints. Oh wait yeah the waitress did stand on the couch and began changing the chalkboard sign which is okay to do at the end of the night but not while wearing a skirt and exposing your cellulite legs to people that are in the middle of eating. Other that everything was good."}
{"text":"Agreed that this place is really only worth visiting for the small rooftop patio.   The rest of the pub is BIG (2 floors) and I do kind of like the atmosphere but only because it really reminds me of my time spent living in the UK; it does have an authentic British pub feel.  They have some decent drink specials worth noting - $3.50 mixed drinks on Thursdays/Sundays, $5 imports on Friday/Saturday, $6 3oz martinis on Wednesdays.  25 cent wings on Wednesdays and 1/2 price appetizers every day from 3-6pm.  It's also a decent place to watch hockey games during NHL season (tvs and projector screens on both floors)"}
{"text":"While I love the atmosphere at Paupers, and the many levels and patios.... I came here to watch the Leafs game tonight for some entertainment, and instead found myself more entertained by my server.  She stumbled over to our table, slurred our drink orders back to us, and then came back 10 minutes later to take our order...again.  We watched as she proceeded to do the same with tables around us, and marveled at how someone could be permitted to work, clearly intoxicated....  I will know now to carefully assess who my server is before I get comfortable here in the future."}
{"text":"I come here for drinks often with friends. They have a large selection of drinks and half price apps after midnight which is awesome! Their daytime menu is delicious and affordable, much better food than you would expect from a little pub the Annex. The wait staff is always very friendly and I have emailed customer service before and found them to be extremely helpful and accommodating.  Overall a great place to go for a meal or hangout with friends. Its large and the atmosphere suits many different events. I would highly reccommend. The only thing that kind of sucks is that they don't offer pitchers."}
{"text":"Came here just for a drink after dinner.   Service was prompt and waitress was attentive. Overall a good experience. We didn't stay for long, but the short time we were there, we had a good time."}
{"text":"First time there. Had one grouchy waitress and one waiter that was cheerful and pleasant.   Their suicide wings were really good. They didn't have a vinegar taste that I imagine all suicide wings would have but they had a dryish seasoning that they used which I thought was quite delicious. The wings were hot but no where close to Duff wings armegedon or death sauce."}
{"text":"This is a great spot with an eclectic crowd - young couples, old couples, construction workers, accountants, hipsters, people who hate hipsters. They have cheap drinks with specials on game nights. Their ribs are over the moon. The staff is great too!"}
{"text":"Rachel is the best! She greeted us right away even though she was really busy. Took a few minutes to order but after that we got our drinks and food super fast! Really appreciated her genuine personality :) thanks again Rachel!"}
{"text":"I came to Paupers AGAIN on Friday night. I went this time with 5 other people plus myself. We went around 12 at night and were going out for a friends birthday. We got their and headed to the rooftop patio again. It was soo busy there was no tables. The waitress had to quickly clean off a big table for our group. The service wasn't so good this time. My drinks for some reason were always 10min later than everyone elses! I was kinda annoyed by that.. The group ordered Nachos which turned out to be huge! All of us eatting them and we didn't finish it!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff, though the food is good, beer is plentiful, the place looks great, and the price is right."}
{"text":"Our waitress was absolutely rude and grumpy the whole night. We got there and when she was assigned to our table, we started ordering drinks (just beers) and because we ordered different kinds, she yelled at us and said \"This is unacceptable! I can't keep up with all of you\" and LEFT. She didn't come back for another 20 minutes (even though we watched he serve other customers) and then told us we were being assigned numbers. She then referred to me as \"3\" the entire night. She came by the table once more between the hours of 7 and 10:30, so we had to go up to the bar and order. She then cut us off at 10:30. She was short, angry, rude and bitter. We tried to cheer her up when she came by, and tried to make her feel good, but got nothing but anger. We spent over $400 as a group of 8, including food. If I ever return, I will leave if she's working. The manager apologized and said she was just having a bad night... what an experience.  The manager then deemed us \"fit to keep drinking\" so he took our orders of shots and beers. But, after the waitress started insulting us (pretty much in front of us) he brought our shots and not our drinks, without even telling us. So we waited for drinks that never came. Some of us literally only had 2 beers the whole time we were there.  If your 45-year-old wait staff cant handle a busy Thursday night, then she shouldn't be working at a pub. Put her on Mondays or something. We ended up going to play pool at the bar beside it called Beer Station and had a wonderful rest of our evening.  P.S. I should mention, I scored a perfect darts game while there. And left close to sober. Just because a waitress is flustered, doesn't mean she can just stop serving us."}
{"text":"In terms of patios, this place is the King, not a pauper. At least in the Annex. Massive side patio plus a roof deck. Al yes-co.   The decor inside of this joint is far beyond English tartan. Yep, Pauper's really brings the heat, as everything is draped in red velvet. It sounds more luxurious than it is, but I think Costanza would still be proud.   Every weekday from 3pm-6pm is half priced starters. I am partial to their hot and tangy Voodoo chicken fingers and mozza sticks. Their beer is a bit overpriced, but I'm just sick of paying $7 for a pint, especially this close to a University Campus. That has to be a crime.   They have a lot of semi-private rooms (draped in stained red velvet, naturally) that are good for groups. Bottoms up.   PEPPER POINTS for the piano bar. Shoobeedoobopbopbop."}
{"text":"In a building that used to be a bank is now a cozy pub. Walk in and there will be no one to greet the guests, allowed to choose any open table to sit down at. The decoration was a mix between a family style restaurant and a sports bar. It had a very homey and comfortable feeling to it. First glance at the menu and nothing seemed to eye catching.  Went with the stuffed burger which comes with a choice of side: fries, house salad, soup or coleslaw. Went with the soup because it sounded delicious and it was. Creamy smooth cream of chicken soup with a hint of spice and some tortellini. Comes with a pack of crackers that tasted great crumbled up in the soup. The beef patty was stuffed with cheese and it was good. Needed more cheese though, since it was only in the centre bites of the burger. Simple, decent burger that was lacking some sauce so added ketchup on top.   Overall, the drink deals are good so definitely a place to consider grabbing a cold one at but would be ordering food to go with the drink."}
{"text":"Food was nothing to write home about as it was pretty standard pub grub.  Service was great and everything but in the summer, their roof-top patio is something to behold...at least for the Annex anyway."}
