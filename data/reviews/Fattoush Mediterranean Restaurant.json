{"text":"This is the best middle eastern place in Cleveland. I love the traditional dishes and the service was excellent. Definitely will come back. Falafel is the best in town."}
{"text":"I went here with a very large group of family members and we went in all very hungry and our food came out within a decent time for such a large order. We ordered everything! From chicken, kabobs, rice, appetizers, and so on. It was a lot of food, very generous. It was all very tasty. The staff was patient with all of if considering we had like 9 kids with us. Being middle eastern myself, I've had plenty of middle eastern food and this place hit the spot. Only reason I gave it a four, I feel the place could use some updating and maybe a cleaner bathroom."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my parents and our 1.5 year old daughter. The waitress accommodated all our numerous requests as we tried to keep our toddler focused on the food. Everyone was happy with the food!  We started with hummus, baba and falafel sampler plate, and then most of us got the lunch special, which is a mixed-meat plate with rice and salad. Wife got the chicken sando which comes with fries. Will definitely be back again while we're in town...maybe tomorrow?"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp. And just Wow! what I found. Great discovery. I've already been here multiple times. The place might look a little off for fine dining setting but once the food's on the table, you'll forget everything else.

Everything freshly made and tastes excellent. The chef is phenomenal. All the dishes we ordered were cooked to perfection. No cons so far except the people taking your order might find a little difficulty in following your dietary requests.

Mixed grill, lamb skewers and Hummus (for free) is a must try. Already a regular customer now."}
{"text":"My first visit to the restaurant, met a friend for lunch.  We both love Middle Eastern Food, and thought this would be a good place to meet up, before heading over to Great Northern Mall.  We arrived slightly before 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon, and were pretty much the only diners there.  We were approached by the owner/server with menus and proceeded to place our orders.  My friend ordered the vegetarian platter and I ordered tabbouleh, and shish tawook wrap with fries.  Our food arrived a short time later, and everything was delicious.  The vegetarian platter was generously portioned, and included baba ghanoush, hummus, tabbouleh and falafel, with a side of pita bread for $4.99.  My tabbouleh was fresh and lemony, just like I like it.  My wrap was good too, the chicken was flavorful and nicely prepared.  Our total was just a little over $18, which was a bargain.  The only hiccup during our visit, is that when we asked for napkins, we were told that there were none.   I would have thought that there should at least be some paper towels in the kitchen or that someone could have gone to one of the surrounding places to pick up some?  The food was good, which is why I rate 4 stars, but the no napkins/paper towels was a bit off-putting."}
{"text":"My father and wanted to try a new place. I am so glad we tried this one.  Food is excellent! We both ordered the Fish dinner which came with salad, hummus, and pita bread. If you like fish you will love theirs. It was grill to perfection."}
{"text":"In town for business and they do not take my company credit card which is an American Express. This is a no go."}
{"text":"Mediterranean experience was wonderful food delicious and you get nice portions. Love the taste and flavors. Did not like the fact I was unable to use my Groupon I had purchased now I have to try and get a refund"}
{"text":"I had a hard time finding the restaurant and when I actually did, I walked in to be told they were not open. I was not exactly sure why. A group of men were inside. The man who stopped me from entering tried to explain but I could not understand. In any case, I was really looking forward to trying this place and now doubt I will ever go back. Too bad."}
{"text":"I really love this place the food was delicious, the customer services is amazing I cannot complain, I was feeling welcome. Love this place!! 
definitely I will be back soon like... Tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is awesome- much better than a few of the local Mediterranean that I have tried. And I was shocked at how much you actually get for such a reasonable price as well. 
You have to use UberEats for delivery but it is worth the $5 delivery fee."}
