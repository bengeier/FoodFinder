{"text":"This place is so great! I cannot recommend it enough. 

The restaurant is inviting starting outside. The flower boxes are a nice touch. The inside is a nice cool blue color with large mirrors and French pictures all around. 

The staff were very friendly. We even got to meet the chef since we came during a slow time. 

Now the best part: the food. It was a-maz-ing! Seriously. So good. The croissants were fresh. I had the Monaco. The sandwich was huge with meat overflowing off of it. It came with a side of potatoes or salad. Always get the potatoes people!!! They are delicious. My mother in law had the potato leek soup and it was also really good. She had a great sandwich as well but I can't remember the name of it so I'm sorry. My sister in law had the croque-monsieur which was amazing!  These sandwiches were so big we didn't think we could finish them but so delicious we couldnt stop.

Now for dessert: save room!! They are always different so we got 2 and a few spoons to split them and couldn't get enough. We had a chocolate mousse that was so creamy and made you feel all good inside. Then we tried this raspberry/white chocolate moose: heaven! When I had my first bite it was like all the birds started chirping and there was a literal glow of happiness emitting from my body. 

Make this place a must try stop when you're exploring the city. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What can I say?

I ordered Quiche Lorraine with Lyonnaise potatoes, and when my plate arrived I could tell right away that the place was legit.  The smell, the presentation, and the TASTE!  Top notch food for sure, prepared by someone who knew what they were doing, and who actually CARED how the food tasted.  A rarity in Pittsburgh, in my experience.

So satisfying.  My friend and I were overwhelmed with the place.  The atmosphere and the service were perfect, I cannot recommend Tartine enough."}
{"text":"This place is just gorgeous inside, but you go for the food.  The atmosphere is lovely and the staff are friendly and welcoming!   I had the quiche Lorraine and potatoes.  Divinely delicious and the texture of the quiche was very smooth and rich.  My companion had the caprese baguette and salad.  It got rave reviews also.  So many delicious offerings on the menu, I will definitely be back to try other dishes.  Check out their menu before you go.  It won't disappoint.  We said to each other as we were eating...this is all the joy of French eating without the snobbery.  Big Love.  We walked off our meal at Artifacts, another \"don't miss\" West End attraction."}
{"text":"On a recent visit home, we decided to go to Tartine for brunch. We were greeted warmly and the place has an intimate, charming feel to it. My Eggs Benedict, with a side of potatoes was delicious - and just the right size! Prices are reasonable and the menu is creative. A true treat, in the West End!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to read all of the positive reviews, because my experience was awful. The service was extremely slow, even though they weren't busy. There were four of us, and none of our meals was good. Poached eggs were cold and way overdone. More like hard boiled. Toast was cold, and the potatoes were under cooked and bland. And the prices are high, $4 for three pieces of bad bacon. And how do you run out of waffles?"}
{"text":"I discovered this place all by my lonesome and went in for breakfast on a whim. The first thing I got was the florentine and it was delicious! The waitress came back after I was finished and asked if I was ready for the check and I said no, I'm ready for another meal! I wanted to see if that first meal was just beginners luck, so next I ordered the French toast and it too was delicious! Since that day, I've returned to Tartine almost every weekend. The wait staff are professional, cute, and have great attitudes and the owner is very kind as well. I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Very bad experience.. Super slow service, they made us wait for 45 minutes while claimed the wait is gonna be 10-15 minutes \"at most\".. The food came after another 45 minutes. The lyonnaise potatoes which are supposed to be their specialty, were not cooked well and cold. The poached eggs were not good either. French toast was terrible. I'm not going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch in an adorable French Bistro!!! Lyonnaise potatoes are perfect and the Dijon Bechamel was fantastic. Left feeling very fat and happy. :)) had an opportunity to meet and converse with the owner,  Lou, and his little buddy,  Bert, was great company too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I took a small group for lunch to try it out and everyone was extremely impressed with the service and quality of food.  Since then several have been back and we have also ordered \"to go\" and received the same great food with a smile.  This is a must try."}
{"text":"My husband and I have begun to frequent this charming, quaint spot for weekend brunch. A gem like this is a very pleasant surprise in the West End neighborhood. The few times we have visited, the wait staff has always been very attentive and warm. The owner is a great retired vet who always makes a point of stopping by each table to greet customers and say \"hello.\" The real is their fabulous quiche. It was fluffy, tender, flaky perfection - it will absolutely keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"Tartine is a hidden gem located in the sleepy neighborhood of the West End. I ordered a coffee to start, as it doesn't appear that they offer any kind of latte or cappuccino or espresso as it wasn't listed on their menu. I ordered the tartine peche, which had a delicious basil and ricotta mix on a slice of bread then topped with peaches. The tartines come with a side of lyonnaise potatoes, which were delicious. They have a cooler in the front of the restaurant and it was empty so I'm not sure if they still have deserts for sale from the cooler or if they were just out of them for the day, as we arrived around 1pm and they close at 2pm. I will definitely stop back again for brunch but definitely earlier in the day! The owner is a really nice guy and his adorable service dog can be seen following him all over the restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Pittsburgh and were searching for a great brunch spot. This restaurant popped up in our searches and we decided to give it a try. It ended up being quite possibly the best brunch we've ever had!

The quintessential French bistro is small and charming and is tucked away in the West End. We had to wait approximately fifteen minutes for a table and it was worth every second! We ordered the quiche lorraine and eggs benedict (each with lyonnaise potatoes) and a side of the Belgian waffle with a berry compote. Both the quiche and the eggs benedict were good. Really good. But we've had really good before. The lyonnaise potatoes, on the other hand, were amazing. Both my husband and I have never tasted potatoes so good! The waffle was equally as delicious - certainly not your typical Belgian waffle. It was sweet but not too sweet and the berry compote added just the right touch.

And just when you think it couldn't get better, let me mention the restaurant's resident service dog who hangs out and ensures you're enjoying your meal. And the owner is no different! A sweet elderly man who wants nothing more to serve his customers a delicious and authentic French meal. And he is certainly doing just that.

My only complaint would be that the (reasonable) serving sizes left me wanting more! To be fair, I think I'd want more regardless of the plate size! If I could, I'd give this place 6 stars - it was one of the best brunch meals I've ever had and it has me wanting to plan a trip back to Pittsburgh just to have an excuse to come here again.  We'll DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful breakfast here with my family. The Belgium waffles and eggs benedict are both amazing! The server was very attentive to us and super friendly. There was also the sweetest dog who made his rounds to every table saying hi. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This a small yet cozy and initmate restaurant. The owner is very personable.  He approached our table as if he had known us for years.  The food was superb but took a little longer to get to the table than expected but I guess perfection takes a little longer.  The Eggs florentine, poached to perfection and the sauce complimented it well.  The potatoes were outstanding and not overcooked.  The ham crepes great flavor and texture was nice.  The peach tartine was refreshing and the ingredients worked well together. Great flavors. Great ambience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place just opened in the historic West End Village.  Breakfast and lunch only.  Cash only.  Very intimate place on the corner of Main & Sanctus streets.  On-street parking is readily available along both streets.  Since it just opened, we've only had a couple of the menu items, but both were excellent, as was the service and the presentation.  The d√©cor is best described as French funky, fresh and fun.  Will go back to sample other menu offerings but they're off to a very good start."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant! Some of the best waffles I have ever had. Also a great touch is the cute pup that walks around and makes sure everyone's enjoying their meal. 

Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Before attending the Steeler game today, we stopped for Brunch. I had a toasted slice of country bread with fresh pears, blue cheese, fig preserves and walnuts. Their sliced potatoes (lyonnaise) accompanied the dish.  It was very good!
Nice atmosphere, the owner greets everyone, intimate dining area.
All meals are prepared fresh (there is no microwave). So be prepared to wait....its French after all!  Well worth the time.
Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My first visit was fantastic, leading me to dine here again. However on my 2nd trip on a Saturday night (reservation only) when I showed up for that reservation for my wife's birthday the restaurant was closed. No warning. No email, no phone call. When I followed up about why it was closed, I still haven't received a response. It's been over a month. Poor, poor customer service. I really wanted to like this place too."}
{"text":"What a charming little bistro this is!  Impeccable service coupled with cute decor, this little cafe on the west end is delightful. It is cash-only and BYOB. There were not too many vegetarian items to be had so I had the Caprese sandwich with salad.  It was good though I expected something a little bit more fresh. (In lieu of a slab of fresh mozzarella, it was some kind of pre-prepped mash?). Tasty, just not what I expected. Hubby had a side of the Lyonnaise potatoes.. Yum!  Wish I'd ordered those. In all a great place!"}
{"text":"This is French food extraordinaire!  This darling place has been open for three weeks and offers breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday until their business picks up.  They should be able to accept credit cards within the next 3 or 4 weeks.  For lunch I had Quiche Lorraine and it was cooked to perfection.  The crust was flaky and light.  The salad was fresh baby greens with a lemon vinaigrette and we ordered a side of the Pommes Lyonnaise.  This was the best lunch that I have had in Pittsburgh since I moved here  nearly two years ago from San Francisco.  The prices are perfect, too.  And they softly play Parisienne music.  Delightful.
Great job!  I hope Tartine lasts a very long time and is packed every day!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning and was super excited to try this cute place out. Atmosphere and interior is adorable so I was looking forward to a similar food experience. I got the spinach, tomato, mozzarella quiche with scrambled eggs on the side. Maybe I didn't order the right thing but sadly I wasn't impressed at all :( my friend ordered the goat cheese and leek quiche with a waffle on the side and I tasted both of her items. The quiches were tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. The layyonaise potatoes that are included with every dish weren't that great either. Potatoes and scrambled eggs had no other seasoning besides huge pieces of black peppercorn, which can be very overpowering. The liege waffle was decent, but a little bit on the dense side, I have has better. And finally, their dessert case only had 3 items in it and none of them were calling my name :/"}
{"text":"I would love to give Tartine five starts. The food - wow! Absolutely delicious. Friendly staff. Seated right away in this cute little french bistro. Even the side toast was just phenomenal. It's also very reasonably priced. However, no air conditioning made dining here at 11am on a summer Sunday just absolutely horrendous. Dripping in sweat, hard to breathe. 

From what I hear, they are relocating to Shadyside this month. So hopefully, AC will happen. If so, definitely have breakfast here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Tartine about a year and a half ago on our first trip together and we were delighted by it. Fast forward to this morning when we were driving through the city again, and decided to stop in. Pittsburgh is a very special city to us, and we were lucky enough to stop back in here before they moved next week! The food is always amazing, we ordered the lyonnaise potatoes, the salad, with lemon-basil dressing that tasted like summer, and I had the poire tartine. Bf also ordered an egg-spinach-bacon lardon-bachamel sauce thing with toast. Love love love the food!! They do a simple neck with great quality ingredients. The atmosphere is charming and I'm in love with the dog like everyone else. Lou, the owner personally greeted us and we shared a few minutes talking with him about his very interesting life. I love Tartine"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm blown away and I already cannot wait to come back! 

Found this place on Yelp while looking for cool brunch spots and I never made it out here because they close at 2pm. (I'm a late riser on the weekends). I may just wake up earlier just to experience Tartine more often. 

You wouldn't expect to find a cute French-inspired eatery in the West End. Upon walking in, we were greeted by such a sweet and friendly white pup. It's not entirely a fancy place but you do feel like you're in a little cafe in Paris. The brunch menu consists of crepes, eggs, quiches, and tartines (like open-faced sandwiches). I honestly wanted to try everything on the menu. I got the Poire Crepes and the hubby got French toast. The Poire Crepes were so light, perfectly cinnamon-y, sweet from the honey drizzle and so darn delicious! The French toast was topped with berries and were sweet enough that no syrup was needed. What I really liked was that the meals here were light, which most brunches leave you feeling 20 pounds heavier. The only downfall in my opinion is it's cash only. 

I definitely plan to revisit to try more items from the menu since it was impossible to try everything during the first visit!"}
{"text":"This a small yet cozy and initmate restaurant. The owner is very personable.  He approached our table as if he had known us for years.  The food was superb but took a little longer to get to the table than expected but I guess perfection takes a little longer.  The Eggs florentine, poached to perfection and the sauce complimented it well.  The potatoes were outstanding and not overcooked.  The ham crepes great flavor and texture was nice.  The peach tartine was refreshing and the ingredients worked well together. Great flavors. Great ambience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So absolutely delicious! Bring cash. Bring an appetite and love for fresh French cuisine! #bountifulblessings

I have now been here two times in my short life thus far.  Firstly I succumbed to a simply delicious luncheonette.

Upon our second serving, I was blessed with brunch (a fresh perfect soft supple crepe  stuffed with jam, dijon mustard, and a... sauce that I cannot remember at the moment.)

Lots of luscious lyonnaise potatoes!

Come thrice, and your satisfaction will only increase.

I was recognized and warmly greeted by my previous server and the owner."}
{"text":"Everything's super fresh and super good. This place is amazing. I've Been here three times now and really enjoyed everything. There's a little dog who wonders around and sports a snazzy scarf. Awesome little place."}
{"text":"This place is located in a really small neighborhood and we went there on a Sunday morning - a group of 4. The place was relatively empty, at around 12pm and we were immediately seated. It looked well decorated, cute and quite an authentic french place. We were served water immediately but the water had a strange fish-like smell. Next we ordered some coffee which too came promptly. But the coffee was cold and we had to send it back for reheating. The lady who was serving us seemed a little hasty and annoyed when we mentioned that the coffee was cold(very politely). Next we ordered some Tartines and a quiche. The food was ok but I have had better tartines at LPQ in DC. and the overall bill was quite low(around 15 per person including tip). They also have a cute dog who was roaming around and sitting near our tables. We petted him for a while and he was quite friendly. Overall it looked like a cute brunch place, although it was a bit of a drive from the squirrel hill area. Food was ok if not anything to kill for. But our experience would have been way better if we received a more friendly, warm service from the waitress. Also, they are a cash only place."}
{"text":"Wonderful French cafe experience in the heart of the West End.  You will love the food and atmosphere, the service is marvelous and the food is delicious and authentic.

It's BYOB, which I love.  And it's cash only, so make sure you visit the ATM before you go."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of Pittsburgh.
My wife and I really enjoy this place. 
As an example; this is where we went to celebrate our anniversary. 
The prix fixe dinner offered on weekends is phenomenal. 
Donna is a most gracious host."}
{"text":"Our brunch meals were amazing, but a little pricey. Worth it, though - we'll definitely go out of our way to go here again."}
{"text":"Want an authentic french experience in da burgh? After a vacay in Paris last summer, I can confidently say, you'll find it at Tartine. This place is adorable. From the cool blue walls to the fluffy rescue mascot (an adorable little pup with a doggie bed in the corner of the restaurant), this place oozes a certain je ne sais quois. The two tops along the wall with chairs turned out invite the unassuming to sit down for a delectable experience. Now, onto the food. I ordered the crepes. (of course) I chose the pear with blue cheese and honey (minus the blue cheese). This breakfast also comes with a side of lyonnaise potatoes. Feeling inspired by the decor, I embraced the french experience and ordered in the language of love. Well . . . looks like the wait staff doesn't speak love. Okay, English it is. Within a few minutes, our order arrived. Three light and delicate crepes filled with pears and topped with honey accompanied by a HUGE order of potatoes. The potatoes were soft and buttery, easily the best lyonnaise potatoes I have had. I ended my meal with a stop at the counter to look at the desserts and pastries. I couldn't leave without trying a berry filled croissant. So light and flaky it literally melted in my mouth. The owner talked to us about how their desserts are imported from Montreal. Overall, the prices for breakfast were very reasonable ($8-$10 for a large portion). But, the pastries and the desserts seemed a bit on the pricey side. My croissant, although large, was half the cost of my breakfast. My only concern is the location. There were only two other tables in the restaurant on a Sunday morning. Hopefully, word catches on and business increases organically."}
{"text":"Wonderful establishment with a simple breakfast/brunch menu. Located in an unlikely area, I stumbled upon this cafe while on business. I enjoyed a croissant with ham and expertly prepared eggs. The coffe was decent but nothing that special. The service was spot on and the proprietor payed a visit to my table. This is a nice touch and is always welcome in my book. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch. Party of six of us stumbled on this place after spending the night downtown. What a treasure. Food was fabulous and wait staff very friendly and attentive. We had a fun conversation with the owner and got to meet Bert (his dog) as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped by for late breakfast on a weekday around 10AM.  The West End seems to be developing into a haven for art galleries and this charming French bistro is a natural extension of that.  I had the smoked salmon plate with a salad, which with coffee came to a very reasonable $10.  Both salmon and salad used fresh ingredients, were well-portioned and overall fantastic.  Great service as well--Lou the owner came over and personally introduced himself to make sure everything was OK.  There is a large display case of very tempting pastries which I will have to try on another visit.  Only one small drawback, no credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Went to Tartine after seeing all the rave Yelp reviews. I must say I was not impressed given all the build-up. I would have given a 4-star, but the service was really bad (I probably should have expected that given that this is a French place). They first gave us cold coffee - then acted a bit grumpy when we asked if they had hot ones (they did give us fresh ones, however). The water they served had a stale fish-like smell, which was vomit-inducing. None of us could drink a drop.

The food was pretty good. I had the Chevre Quiche, and sampled the Poire Tartine, the Peach Tartine, and the Salmon Tartine from my friends."}
{"text":"Quaint little find! Always fresh, quality food! 

I just wish I could get here more often!

NOTE: Does not accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot in the heart of the west end! Love that they have brunch on Saturdays as well as Sunday's. Food is a tasty surprise!"}
{"text":"A cute little restaurant in the heart of the West End. Delicious food and attentive service. I could sit in there all day with a good book sipping on coffee and eating my way through the menu. Can't wait to go back again! Had the peach Tartine and friend had the eggs florentine, we shared both dishes and were both very impressed with the quality and taste. Great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Cash only. The owner is so friendly and makes the rounds ensuring everything is perfect. The quiche is amazing."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  Came here for Sunday brunch and tried the florentine eggs benedict.  The eggs were perfectly poached but the sauce left something to be desired.  It needed a bit more zip and zing - it tasted a bit bland.  Potatoes and toast come with the benedict selections and they were tasty.  

Decided to try one of their pastries in their dessert case and got this chocolate/almond concotion.  It was good but a bit pricey at $8 since that's the cost of their entrees.  Maybe I wasn't really in the mood for something chocolately or was just full from the eggs benedict but I couldn't finish it.  

The decor is charming and the I had never been to this part of town so I would recommend that folks check this area/place out if you've never been."}
{"text":"Unwelcoming! Extremely overpriced! Don't waist your money! A lemon bar from  a box made in the comfort of your home is ten times better!  The staff are rude and lack customer service! I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Tartine twice now, most recently with my wife and her parents this past Saturday for brunch.  Whenever you walk through the doors of this establishment you are immediately transported to what I have been told is an authentic French experience.  There is a display case with pastries and desserts whenever you first walk in along with some tables.  Further back there are also some more tables as well as some nice looking mirrors and other French decor.  There is also some older French music playing in the background giving it a nice ambiance.  Both times that I have been here I have been greeted and talked to by the owner which I have enjoyed.  This last time I was also able to meet his adorable service dog who was always near him.

For my brunch entree this time around I went with the A La Benedict which is pretty much your traditional eggs benedict while our table also decided to split a side of sausage and a savory pear and blue cheese dish.  While I personally was not such a big fan of the split dish, the rest of my table raved about it so I figure that it had to be me.  Of course the reason that I found that dish to be not as good is that my eggs benedict were stellar.  Everything about it came together nicely as the saltiness of the ham combined with the richness of the egg yolk and some slight sourness of the hollandaise formed a meal that I could eat over and over again.  As with most dishes there, it also came with a side of potatoes lyonnaise which were also very good and left me feeling pretty full.  The previous time I visited I was also very pleased with the Jambon crepe that I had.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.  Everything about this place is great from the ambiance to the food and even the owner."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic from the coffee to the tartine, to the sausage. The little dog in the sweater made it an even more pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I've honestly never met a waffle that didn't need syrup, until now. The waffles here are truly the best I've ever had. There is not a thing I would do to improve them. No syrup, no berry compote, no chicken (which is crazy talk cause I ADORE chicken and waffles), nothing. They are pure and amazing exactly as is. You could actually taste the sugar crystals in the batter, perfectly cooked and perfectly sweet. It is lucky that we live an hour away or I would eat them entirely too often!
Tartine is an adorable little cafe, cash only, where the resident dog greets you at the door. The service was quick and friendly. The menu is simple and everything on it is done exceptionally well!
Chris hd the smoked salmon tartine and it was also delicious. The lyonnaise potatoes are perfect accompaniments, perfectly buttery without being greasy, lightly seasoned, cooked just right. Honestly one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time and hands down my absolute favorite waffle ever!"}
{"text":"The three best things about this place were the decor, dessert, and the quiche. I wasn't a huge fan of the owner having his dog walk in the restaurant, as I'm not a fan of live animals being near food prep stations. I'm also ALLERGIC to dogs so that was a huge bummer as well, but luckily my allergies didn't flair up.

The food took a long time to reach the table and most of it was forgettable, save for the quiche. The quiche is the sole reason I would go back to this place. It's a darn shame this place is so far off the beaten path because that quiche was super good and I haven't found similar offerings near where I live now."}
{"text":"Go to Tartine!!! This little restaurant is charming and just what the West End area needs to perk up the once thriving town. 

We went for lunch at 12 on the dot and the place was slammed. The poor waitress was on her own but gracefully hopped from table to table. The owner came in and greeted everyone, stopping to talk with everyone as if they were old friends and thanking guests for coming.

We each had a dish: quiche with bacon, chicken/olive/hard boiled egg sandwich, croque monsieur and everyone ordered and LOVED the lyonnaise potatoes. 

We all shared a delicious dessert of chocolate cake with orange flavor, white and chocolate squares around the outside. The desserts are brought in from Montreal and they're delicious."}
{"text":"Really surprising to see only a few reviews for such a great restaurant. Wife and I happened to be around this area after visiting the Duquesne Incline and boy was I glad to have found this place.

French food at its finest. They are best known for their \"Tartine\" which is really an open faced sandwich that I highly recommend. My wife got the Strawberry tartine and that was absolutely delicious. I got the Croque Monsier, which was equally delicious - they had this thick sliced ham with nice thick cheese. Highly recommended. Their quiches and desserts look good too, but didn't try this.

Also wanted to point out how nice the owner himself was (or at least I'm assuming it's the owner). He personally greets each customer as they walk in and thanks each customer when they leave. That's great service and a testament to the restaurant.

Other advice:
CASH only
Street Parking
Closes early - check their hours
As others have mentioned - there is a dog that walks around - if you don't like that, you might want to consider somewhere else"}
{"text":"The cutest spot and the nicest people! Especially coming from California the Owner gave all of us a lift to our Hotel cause the Taxis are horrible here!! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I wanted to try this restaurant.  We walked in at 2:10pm.  They closed at 2 but very kindly seated us anyway.   The flower boxes out front looked beautiful. This time of year they usually look ratty. We decided the two waitresses looked like French country maids.  We ordered quiche Lorraine and a tuna salad croissant with the lyonnaise potatoes.   OMG!   The quiche was perfect.   The tuna salad unique -not mayonnaisey  (not sure thats a word!). and the potatoes were perfection.   They came hot and fresh!    The ice tea was served in small glasses - not plastic!  The decor was very nice - blues with pretty mirrors and pictures.  We ordered three wonderful desserts to take home because they were calling our name since we sat next to the dessert display case.  They were a bit pricey at $8 a piece but we were assured thy were worth it.   We looked at the breakfast and Sunday brunch menus and we will be back to try those!

Postscript:  The desserts were not near as good as the looked!  Wouldn't have them again.  Still a 5 star though!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, small and quaint authentic French decor. Owner very attentive, personally spoke with each table. Wait staff was very friendly and prompt. Coffee and water always filled to brim. Food was delicious and fresh. Tartine du Peche was incredible. The crepes weren't my favorite, but my boyfriend loved them. We were too full to have dessert but everything looked delicious. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Waaaa, this location has closed and did not reopen in Shadyside.  What a loss


What a find...tucked away in the West End, on Main Street is a lovely and tasty bistro.  It's like going to a friends house for a gourmet meal!  The brunch was our first time adventure and the eggs benedict....beyond description.  Best I have ever had!  Lou the owner is delightful and welcoming and if you like visiting, he has great stories!  Looking forward to bring friends for lunch and trying their now, Friday and Saturday dinner menu (limited times!)  Check it out, it's worth the try."}
{"text":"An out-of-town friend was in for a brief visit, and I intended to take her to breakfast at the Micro Diner on Mr. Washington before seeing the city from that vantage point. 

For whatever reason I could not think of an easy way to get to Mt. Washington from my home. I ended up on Main Street in the West End where we stumbled upon Tartine. How fortuitous! What a sweet find! 

Beautifully painted with oversized black and white prints of the Eiffel Tower and cafe music in the background, this adorable French Bistro has a lovely ambiance. The food is delicious! My friend had the ham and Gruyere Tartine with spring mix salad. I had the eggs florentine with lyonnaise potatoes. Tre magnifique!! (Sorry. Had to.) 

For once, being a space cadet paid off. Otherwise we would never have discovered such a lovely find. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My son and I came in and immediately I realized it wasn't a great place for kids. But there were only 2 other tables full and I figured he would be good enough to make it through a lunch. I saved a seat for my husband who wasn't sure if he would make it. 

I ordered my food, a poached chicken baguette and oh it was SO good. It was a good portion size and I got the potatoes on the side because the salad was not available. The potatoes were very tasty. I ordered my son strawberries on the side but it took a while for him to get them, we were nearly done with the rest of the meal by the time he got them. Then my husband showed up and the waitress only had 2 other tables so I'm not sure why it took so long for her to bring him a water and then take his order. He enjoyed his meal as well. We ordered a chocolate mousse to share and it was excellent! It reminded me of eating dessert in Paris! 

The place was clean and the decor was cute. There are so many good French restaurants and bakeries in town that I think I would rather go to with better service."}
{"text":"What a delightful place.   It is a very clean restaurant & the ambience was very conducive to a fine dining experience in a casual setting.  
   The food was great.  The lyonnaise potatoes were so good, I normally use ketchup, not necessary.   The ham & bechamel sauce crepe was excellent.   My husband got the eggs benedict best we ever had.   
   The owner is a delight so warm & charming.  He makes you feel so welcome & is very attentive to the customers.    It was a great way to start our morning.     
  
   Take cash, which I feel is the only way to go I hate credit cards, they dont accept credit cards.  We will definitely go back to try a quiche which also looked delicious.  Highly recommended.  You also must go to meet Bert.   Gotta try the wonderful food & find out who Bert is.   Bon appetit!!!!"}
{"text":"Made the trek out to the West End on a Sunday for brunch:
* My friend and I arrived at 10am and were seated immediately which was great because it was chilly outside! The place filled up by the time we left around noon.
* Cash only and street parking.
* We ordered the ch√®vre quiche, lorraine quiche and the belgian waffle with berry compote that we split. The quiches were delicious - light and creamy - and the crusts were crunchy and flakey but needed to be warmer, the middle was cold, and the ham in the lorraine was a little chewy (did not stop me form eating my whole portion...). The belgian waffle too was devoured and had crispy edges. The compote for the belgain waffle was tart which offset the sweetness of the waffle with the powdered sugar. All had sides of lyonnaise potatoes which were good too though had excess oil by the time I finished them and a little bit more salt (we did not eat the potatoes that accompanied the waffles as we were stuffed!). The potatoes were thinly cut and had a nice combo of crispy with non-crispy with some white onions. 
* Serving sizes were appropriate in my opinion given the amount of richness from the cream and butter - things french food does not scrimp on! With one dish, I was content, not stuffed, and by the time I finished one half of the waffles I was full.
* I ordered coffee which was ok tho bottomless and my friend had tea - our waitress had a box of tea bags to select from.
* The owner was sweet and introduced himself to us. Then after our meal he came by to say goodbye. His dog was super cute and stayed by the door.

This french bistro is a hidden gem in a neighborhood with a few other businesses that line main street. However Tartine would be the only reason I would be in the West End and would gladly come back."}
{"text":"I need to preface this review with one fact. Next week they are moving to Ellsworth Ave in Shadyside near Soba. The owner greeted us and explained part of the reason is that there current location lacks air conditioning.He said he was contemplating doing lunch and maybe dinner at their new location. My girlfriend and I came in just a little late for breakfast so we settled for lunch.

We opted first for the chicken salad  as a salad. It came topped with cranberries but the rest of the items noted on the menu appeared to be missing. The chicken salad had hardly more than a tablespoon full on it so we decided to order something to go with it. Of the quiches they only had one available made with goat cheese so we settled for that one along with an order of their Lynonniase potatoes. The quiche was very good. The potatoes were just so-so. We noticed that their dessert refrigerator was empty because they had run out of food. Our waitress was very helpful and attentive to our needs.

We are giving benefit of the doubt on this meal because of their imminent move to Shadyside. Whether the business will improve over there remains to be seen. Please be aware of the fact that they will have a new address soon and won't be here after the end of June."}
{"text":"Wow! This was really great and unexpected.  My first impressions of the place upon entering was clean, friendly and charming. I had been meaning to try this place in the west end since it opened and today I finally got around to it.
I had half a quiche lorraine and half an order of crepes with brie and dijon bechamel along with the potatoe lyonnaise. I have never had either of these dishes before and both were fantastic! Cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were also great and tasted like more. I tried one of the chocolate desserts and want to go back and get another . This place is a great step up from your local diner. I was here for brunch but will be back again this week. 
My only disappointment is in myself having not gotten here sooner. Check it out. Bring cash."}
{"text":"Caaaa-uuuute little French Bistro. I've never been to the West End of town before and when I walked in I was taken to a whole other world. If you've been or live on that side of town you obviously know there are few businesses on the main street. I'm sure that their mission is to shine a light into the West End and promote more cool local businesses to come. While I selfishly wish it was closer to me... I would gladly make a trip here again!

Everything works with the theme. The French music, the beautiful French pastries in the display case and the delicious french food! I was definitely tempted by the \"official\" tartine section of the menu (an open faced sandwich), but settled on the eggs Florentine for breakfast. 

Fabu choice because it was scrumptious. The eggs were perfectly poached, and the addition of bacon and roasted tomato underneath those eggs were devine! I only wish there was more delicious (and what seemed like homemade) bread to soak up the cream sauce. 

The woman who served us, who may have been the owner, was super sweet and attentive. I do hope that they do well! Please go visit! For a cute overload we had the pleasure of seeing a regular stop in with his dog, who promptly hopped into his doggie bed that was out for him. How adorable is that? 

IF that doesn't make you want to stop in, I don't know what will!"}
{"text":"Was a wonderful place for a leisurely lunch. The entrees were great and the desserts memorable. My \"guys\" didn't appreciate the euro-sized drinks. Service was very friendly but just s bit spotty. Would go again if I had the time."}
{"text":"What joy! What bliss! I haven't had a dessert that good since I was on my honeymoon! My friends and I had a business meeting, and we decided to make this location our meeting place. Fabulous idea!
Each of us chose something different from the main menu, and we were all extremely delighted with our choices. If you are ordering a sandwich or the quiche, you must get the pommes Lyonnaise. Perfectly done and seasoned. This time, I decided to get one of the entr√©e salads. It was quite good, though I believe the meet was slightly overcooked. It was surrounded by fresh vegetables, and pickled accoutrement.  
For dessert, there were four tartines on the menu, and my friends and I ordered one of each for the table. They were, hands-down, the best part of the meal. Bananas and Nutella, freshly-picked strawberries, peaches and basil, and pear and walnuts. Each one came with cr√®me fra√Æche on a crostini, and they were deliciously mouth-watering! Beautiful presentation, too!
The service was pleasant and timely. This is great spot for lunch or dinner. Be sure to note that they close at 2 in the afternoon to prepare for the dinner crowd."}
