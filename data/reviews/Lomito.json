{"text":"this place is great. i got the manchito and because of the runny egg i had to use a knife and fork to eat it but it was REALLY good. i'll most definitely be returning. i'm so full and sleepy now but in a good way. it's BYOB, too! maybe slightly expensive for sandwiches in baskets but the food is obviously great quality (meat, etc.) so i wasn't mad about it. you get what you pay for here!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find out where they're going to be, but they serve the best sandwich in the Pittsburgh.  The Completo is awesome."}
{"text":"The Lomito Completo was magnificent 

Messy goodness with every bite.  One of the best sandwiches I've had"}
{"text":"Hadn't heard of Lomito before I tried them during Little Italy Days in August. I believe I had pork cubes covered in chimichurri on a Kaiser roll. While I can't remember the exact dish, I remember walking away impressed and that \"Lomito\" would be a name to remember. Since August, Lomito has moved into Fukuda's old space at 4740 Liberty Ave. I stopped in here today for lunch and had the Manchito special. The Lomito Manchito (aka el Disastro): organic sirloin, provolone, fried egg, ham, avocado, bacon, chimichurri, lettuce and tomato on a Kaiser roll. For $3 more, I got the combo, ordering the feijoada (rice and beans with tomato vinaigrette) and a freshly prepared limonada (fresh squeezed lemons, mint and simple syrup.)

Everything was very good. The sirloin was thin and well done; I'd prefer to see it a little more rare. The bacon was also a bit crispy for my taste. Still, both of these are matters of personal preference. The feijoada was very tasty for being nothing more than rice and beans with tomato and onions. The limonada was prepared front of house (where the sushi chefs used to work). It was refreshing, the floating mint leaves giving it a taste that cannot be mimicked by a manufactured syrup. 

Not yet fully staffed, Lomito is only open M-F, 11a-7p. The manager informed me that dinner hours are coming within a matter of weeks. Meat is sourced through DJ's Butcher's Block, just down the street, and bread comes from Breadworks on the North Side. Liberty has bar food, albeit most of it pretty decent, in spades. Liberty also has Japanese in Ginza and obviously a couple solid Italian joints, Del's notably NOT one of them. Lomito is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. I look forward to coming back. Give it a try and spread the word."}
{"text":"I walked in today right when they opened. I was famished. I had not eaten breakfast so I went for the vegetariano. The egg was cooked perfectly over medium and the combination of chimichurri and roasted peppers were bursting with flavor. Glad I happened upon this Bloomfield gem!"}
{"text":"You know about their food truck? No? You're missing out and so was I. 

Let's just say that their Lomito Complete sandwich was orgasmic enough for me to scarf down the entire sandwich. Accompanied with a mint lemonade and Mexican corn, well, that was delicious. I'm waiting for the line to be out the door on this small shop."}
{"text":"Saw them and checked out their food at Little Italy Days. This was the first time I've heard of this food truck, as well as the first time I've had a lomito. If you check the listed website, it seems somewhat outdated (the last post was from a year ago), but their facebook page looks more up to date. If you manage to find them, definitely try a lomito! I had the Completo, which was essentially a sandwich with fried egg, vegetables, and delicious flank steak. I was blown away by how tasty and juicy the meat was, and was also rather surprised that they actually made the meat after I ordered (rather than having the stuff pre-made like many food trucks do). It was like a delicious gourmet burger, except that the meat was steak instead of a patty. Find them if you can!"}
{"text":"The Lomito Truck's delicious sandwiches take me back to my study aboard days in South America. In Argentina, you can find Lomitos in local greasy spoon joints as a late night bite.  I remember a spot near my house that was essentially a garage, but had some of the best meat sandwiches I have ever tasted (and also gave me some of the worst food poisoning... Alas the perils of life abroad.) 

Lomito takes me back to that time, albeit without the unnecessary gastrointestinal issues. The truck (and now brick and mortar location on Liberty Ave) offers an array of South American dishes including Lomitos, rice and beans, pork sandwiches, and grilled corn. 

On my past two trips to the truck I've stuck with the always fantastic Lomito Completo: a flank steak sandwich topped with ham, provolone, tomato, fried egg, chimmi churri, and mayo. The sandwich is unwieldy, and I suggest you eat it in one sitting, lest the delicious ingredients fall apart. The flavors compliment each other to create a gooey, messy pile of sandwich that I usually only dream about. 

The sandwich does take time to make, and I suggest once you have it in your hands you sit somewhere and concentrate on eating it. This isn't the kind of food truck meal you can nosh on absentmindedly. 

Now that Lomito has a store front, I won't have to roam the streets in search of a food truck to get my South American snack fix."}
