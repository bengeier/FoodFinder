{"text":"Extremely disappointing.  This place had been on my To-Try list for a while now. I came with three friends on a Saturday night when it was not too busy. I ordered the beef ribs ($16.50) with a side of potato salad ($4.00). My friends ordered the pork ribs ($16.00), along with a few appetizers.  What bothered me about the service was that they just sort of drop the food off at the table to no one in particular. Ideally, the server should place the dish in front of the specific person who ordered it, or at the very least ask, \"Okay who ordered the so-and-so?\" and place it in front of whoever answers. Also, delivery should be simultaneous. Two of my friends got their dish, and me and the fourth friend waited 15 minutes after that for ours.  For $16.50, I received TWO beef ribs with barely any meat on them. In my opinion, ribs should be fall-off-the-bone. These were the exact opposite, and the flavour was nothing special. My friend was even more disappointed with his pork ribs, and sent them back in exchange for the pulled-pork sandwich.  First time in a very long while where I tipped less than 15%."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in quality of the food and the portion size for the price. Ordered the rib ends and brisket plate for delivery using Uber Eats. Order took one hour 20 min to arrive.   Rib ends were essentially bone and fat deep fried in batter. The brisket plate included two small, fatty slices of meat  (I guess this is meant to be a half pound) for $18. Order came to $43 with all the charges. Totally not worth it.   Called the restaurant but they largely unhelpful, suggesting I contact Uber eats. Doesn't make sense really as the problem is the food rather than the delivery."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner with the husband on Sunday and we were both pretty blown away!   I have heard plenty of great things about Electric Mud since it opened, and we have visited and loved (the food that is) at Grand Electric several times, but only just made it this weekend - but we will be back soon!  We shared 1 hot link, Rib Ends, Pulled Pork Sandwich, and the Fried Chicken. Fried chicken had to be the favourite, the gravy it sits in which is sweet, savoury and spicy was to die for. The portion was just right for 2 people to share and the price was more than fair at around $9. The chicken was SO crispy. I don't know how it would do as delivery or takeout but eating in, it is a must!  The pulled pork sandwich was also stupid good. The pork had a smoky but not overly smoked taste which was accented by a vinegary coleslaw and the sweet, soft, and toasty milk bun.   The hot link was spicy!! Worth getting one at $6.50 for sharing, they also had 2 other flavours of sausage. The pineapple bbq sauce it came with was a nice accompaniment, it was also a bit spicy but the sweetness counteracted nicely.   I think our least favourite was the rib ends but they certainly weren't bad. Tasted more like chinese food with the sauce, sesame seeds, and scallion garnish. They were difficult to eat so I think we'd go with regular pork or beef rib next time.   This may become a regular spot, for both of us (plus 1 cocktail) total was $50! I think that's good value for so much meat."}
{"text":"Went here on a weeknight and got take-out. The place was about half-full when we got there, but were easily able to order right away. The service was excellent - friendly and fast. Our food was ordered, package and ready to go in less than 10 minutes.   We ordered two sandwiches and two sides. The pork sandwich and potato salad were both two of the best dishes I've eaten in Toronto. Would highly recommend ordering these if you go.   Overall a great take-out experience. Quick, friendly service, and great food at a good price. We will be back."}
{"text":"Definitely a hipster hangout for people who have never tasted good bbq.  My husband and I were seated in the temporary enclosed patio at a communal table because, allegedly, the others were reserved. The other empty tables did not have other patrons sitting at them for our entire meal.  The waitress treated us as though we should have been grateful that she even acknowledged  us.  I have never been to a bbq restaurant which does not serve fries. I asked what the mains were served with and we were told it was a \"sharing menu\"!  That's new language for being nickle and dimed for what you normally wouldn't have to pay for.  We ordered a serving of fried chicken each and all 3 sides: coleslaw, beans, and potato salad. Thank goodness, the portions were small.  The chicken was bland and the deep fried coating was overly crunchy and fell off as you cut. I ordered a small glass of the house ale for $7. Overall, a very underwhelming experience.  They got my money once. Enough said."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. The three of us ordered the beef brisket and all three plates were the fattiest cuts of brisket we've ever had. So many better BBQ options in Toronto. The patio is nice here if you're looking for a cool place to drink, but I would skip the overpriced, small portioned, and underwhelming food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great value and awesome atmosphere!.  Great selection of music playing as well."}
{"text":"To avoid the rush we went for dinner at EMB at opening time on a Sunday (5:00). Just on Saturday EMB has been noted in the Globe and Mail as one of Toronto's top 10 restaurants for 2013... so we expected the worst. We arrived to an empty restaurant BUT within 15 minutes half the restaurant was full (like 10 tables!)  We tried some of the popular dishes including the Brisket Sandwich, Pork Ribs, Beef Ribs, and Fried Chicken. Highlights of those 4 dishes were the brisket sandwich and fried chicken. Brisket was extremely tender and taste d amazing (Montreal smoked meat plus BBQ sauce plus cheese). Fried chicken was very moist and had a thin crispy layer. Pork ribs sauce was a bit too tangy. Beef ribs were Flintstone size but somehow still very tender!    Overall what impressed me the most about EMB was that all the meat was so moist. Definitely aiming to go back to try other items."}
{"text":"Popular little place with friendly staff, good service and tasty food. Had the fried chicken platter which was delicious, and crunchy crunchy. Side of potato salad was large but not really good enough to finish. Also had the deep fried pig skins which tasted like they were from a bag, dry and not very flavourful.   Uh... so ya, the chicken was good!"}
{"text":"Two words for you Toronto: CALM DOWN.    Jesus.  It's like none of you have ever had barbecue before.  The interior is all plywood and Schlitz posters from the 80s.  There are a million staffers for a place that seats like, 30 people.  3 Servers and about 4 people working the kitchen/bar - all of them standing around with toques.  To me, this is the kind of place where the cooks could easily staff the front of the house.  The environment left me feeling blah.  It just felt really smug and contrived to me.  I get it.  It's so funny to pretend to be a rough-and-tumble dive!  I just want a bit more authenticity (which I know is loaded).  I guess what I'm looking for is something that isn't so engineered and textbook.    Overall, the food was good, but not great.  Definitely not deserving of the hype.  Not worth lining up for either.  The price is fair for what you get.    From the shareable sides ($3.50 each) we got the \"crack rolls,\" which are a standout.  Soft, buttery, sesame-flecked rolls are served with a side of whipped, sweetened rendered smoker fat mixed with butter.  The spread is topped with sea salt and has that killer combination of sweet, salty, fatty deliciousness going for it.  The rolls are warm and are the perfect empty-calorie consistency.  This dish was great.  We also got their pickles, which were ho-hum at best.    Also from their sides, we got their smoked nuts, which turned out to be peanuts given the baked beans treatment, which wasn't what any of us were expecting.  I think we all thought they would be seasoned, dry smoked nuts.  We also got the duck ham, which is duck that is cured and smoked like a ham.  Nice texture. This was my dining companions' favourite dish, but not mine.  I got tired of the ham taste and you really lost the duck.  I liked the lightly pickled cucumber it was served with.  The main dishes were in the $13 range, overall.  The ribs were tasty.  They were smoked but not overly so - I didn't get an overpowering smoky flavour from them.  They were cooked to the point where they still had a decent bit of chew and served with a kind of Asian/hoisin kind of a glaze and topped with crushed peanuts.  This was probably my favorite dish.  We also got the fried chicken, which was 2 weirdly shaped thighs (so weird that even though I'm a thigh woman, I thought they might be white meat and passed them up in favour of a drum), and 2 drumsticks served with honey and special reserve Tabasco.  This was also good but not transcendent.  The crust on the chicken was thin and slid right off the chicken skin, which was still flabby underneath.  The meat had been brined, but possibly almost too much so?  I think there's a difference between a juicy fried chicken and a fried chicken where you have crust and then it tastes like the meat is poached underneath.  This was good, but nowhere near come fi testing other better fried chicken I've had (I am a fried chicken connoisseur).    Dessert was an aggravatingly overpriced ($5!) \"banana cream pie\" which was such a throwaway.  Basically graham crumbs, a dollop of banana pudding and whipped cream.  Whither my 'Nilla wafers (the way they do it in the South).  It was amateurish at best.  I came home and yammed about 10 Oreos with a cold glass of 2% and that was much more satisfying, to give you some indication."}
{"text":"Came here on a recco from a friend and it did not disappoint.  We already had dinner plans at a friends so we stopped in on our way to check out the pink lemonade drinks.  Myself am not a whiskey/bourbon fan so left the bourbonade to my better half who thoroughly approved.  I went for the Porch Crawler basil gin and pink lemonade which was delicious. Alongside our drinks we had the spicy pickled green tomatoes which were a bit too vinegary for my taste; and pork rinds that came with the best soft cheese - a must have!  Next time we are in town we will be back for the BBQ!  Ps - note that the smoker is inside so if you are not a fan of smelling smoky you may prefer takeout or to sit on the outside patio area."}
{"text":"Horrible service, rude with attitude, took half an hour to my drink.  The menu is lacking, not very good appetizers.  The fries are also cheap shoestring fries and the food is overpriced for what you get.  Definately a hipster place..."}
{"text":"I'm so sick of these hipster restaurants that make you feel as if it's a privilege for you to be served by them. I went there on a sunday night and the waitress appeared annoyed when I asked questions about the menu. She was abrupt and made me fel completely rushed when ordering. She never smiled and looked it me like I had 2 heads when I asked if they could cut the sandwich in half. They also seat you at these ridiculously small tables and then say that if it gets busy they will squeeze another couple in with you. You would be practically snuggling with a complete stranger! Anyways, onto the food. The brisket sandwich was delicious and surprisingly filling. It was very saucy and I loved the fried onions. The poboy sandwich was nothing special and it was very bland and I felt the bread was too thick. We also shared the fried chicken which was okay but again nothing memorable. The best fried chicken is at 416 Snack Bar and Home of the Brave. Will not return."}
{"text":"I did not like my experience here. However, I will try to be objectively brief here.  1. Calling this BBQ is like calling Taco Bell mexican. Just not true. It is more in the line of 're-imagined grilled food', akin to what Grand Electric does. They are missing what makes great barbeque so good, i.e. simplicity and care.  2. Having said the above, it shouldn't be a surprise that dishes tend to be tapas sized portions for full sized prices. (if you think I am overly price sensitive, I am...this is supposed to be 'everyperson' food!! ). I don't care if the peanuts were grown by virgin 18 year olds, and watered only with Evian, $13.50 for 3 ribs is not acceptable to me.   3. The good things: The duck ham, it is very good and this being they get points for being the first (and only?) place in Toronto to serve it. Also good is the Bourbon selection. If you like bourbon (or are getting started on it), this is a good place to try a variety of them.   Bottom Line: This is BBQ for the hipsters and I am happy with letting them keep it to themselves."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! Loved the food, the flavours, the nonchalance and the wicked blues from the record player."}
{"text":"Long wait? You betcha. Hipster vibe? Come on - you know that goes hand in hand with long waits. Bourbon induced hangover? I'd rather not reminisce...   But it was so worth it.  The Wait  Sure, we must have waited about an hour and a half for a table, but that's true of many trendy joints in Toronto. At any rate, there are plenty of places (and patios in the summer) to grab a drink  while you wait. Though you'll probably have time for two or three... For patios, try: Mezzrow's, Cadillac Lounge, Not My Dog, or The Rhino. In the winter, nowhere is cozier than Salvador Darling.  The Drinks I went here with a group of six for a birthday and managed to score a picnic table on the patio. Our group was on the booze wagon, so we continued with EM's signature Beergarita, which is essentially exactly what it sounds like: a margarita on the rocks mixed with beer. Most people found it tasty, though I thought it was too bitter and preferred the Clydesdale - a blend of bourbon, lime, and agave that is just what a cocktail kicking off the summer should be (i.e. refreshing). So on the whole, though the beer selection was limited, EM's drinks menu was a hit with our crowd.   The Food The website doesn't mention this, but you can get a family style platter to share that's ideal for large groups. Our server recommended one platter for the six of us in addition to a few starters. We customized our platter, though I don't think that's normally an option. (We were only able to because they happened to be out of a few items.) I think it generally comes with fried chicken, ribs, pork belly, hot links, then an assortment of sides (like cole slaw, collard greens, potato salad). I know this sounds like a lot of food - and it is - but it wasn't enough for four young men and two women. We had to order another platter - and DID NOT hear the end of it from the staff. (Seriously - they thought it was HILARIOUS. And it made us question whether we were over-eating, but I assure you that wasn't the case.)  Stand-out items were the Pork Belly (though you don't want to eat a lot of it, given how rich it is), the Ribs were yummy (and I thought the rib to sauce ratio was spot on unlike some other reviewers, but maybe the chefs have adjusted their dosage), and the Banana Cream Pie is really something else. Even though you probably won't want to consider dessert after all that meat, but really: get one of these to share. It's unmissable.   The Vibe  Finally, I have a feeling whether you dine inside or outside has a huge impact on your experience. Try to get a table outside. I think the best strategy to achieve this is to go with a group of 4-6 people. Their picnic tables accommodate those numbers nicely, and it seems like smaller parties tend to get seated indoors. And the indoor tables have the misfortune of being situated within range of the blaring music system that would understandably sour the experience for most. So, I'm not sure I would venture here in the winter.  But otherwise, I dig this place. The decor is fitting - you feel like you've stumbled upon a road-side joint in the Louisiana bayou and the only thing missing is some old-timer playing the blues. Sure, there are hipsters. But: a) what have they ever done to you? and b) the crowd is much more of a mixed bag than what other reviewers might make it out to be. It's a really popular place, so the crowd is actually pretty eclectic, because come on! Drinking bourbon and eating bbq at a picnic table has mass appeal. I don't know when it became uncool to show enthusiasm for trends, but I have no problem climbing aboard the bbq bandwagon.   So, dearest Electric Mud, I want you to know: I do plan on coming back now, you hear?"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in toronto. The food is phenomenal and there is great booze and great service. Id recommend it for a casual date or dinner with friends. Reasonably priced. Tends to cater to a younger crowd, ranging from 18-30's."}
{"text":"It is a great restaurant and one of Toronto's best BBQ joints, and the taste is great, but the size of the portions are ridiculously small. Take the beef ribs for example: you'll pay $18 for only two ribs, which are mostly bone (look at the pictures here on Yelp). You pay $10 for three small pieces of fried chicken. So the quality is good, but not enough for me not to feel ripped off."}
{"text":"Visited Electric Mud BBQ on a Tuesday night. Super pleasant host took our name and offered us a drink while we waited for our table. A tiny, eclectically decorated space (look out for the emu over the stairs!:) water arrived as soon as we sat down. To start we ordered the pork rinds(great spicy cheese spread for dipping) crack buns & buffalo cauliflower (amazing!). Dinner consisted of: pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, fried chicken, beans & potato salad. Loved everything!"}
{"text":"A great little spot in Parkdale. It was massively busy around 9 on a Friday night. But good on EM to take phone numbers and offer to call you back when a table is free.   A table for 2 only took about a 45 min wait. We sat down at one of the communal picnic tables (the ONLY way to eat southern BBQ) and asked our newly adopted family what they were eating, what was good, etc. They reco'd some seriously good food that I will relay to you. But be sure to ask your tablemates anyway and act surprised when they also reco: beef ribs, crack rolls, fried chicken, shrimp & grits. Plus it's a good icebreaker y'know?   The ribs were massive and succulent. They fell right off the bone. They only came out in 2's so brace yourself. The crack rolls were so soft and came with milk butter so unhealthy and so good it makes you wanna slap yo momma! You end up dipping the rolls in the grits and other saucy leave-behinds. Fried chicken was.. well.. fried chicken!   The service was superb and the atmosphere was so cool. Our tablemates were about to leave when we sat down but they ended up staying another hour and we were just chilling over good food and drink.  I highly recommend this place to southern BBQ/comfort food lovers. I can't wait to come back and try the other parts of the pig I didn't get to try this time around."}
{"text":"While the food is not bad I find the smoked ribs are never smoked long enough resulting in chewy meat that is not fall off of bone tender at best and the occasional rib that is completely undercooked at worst.  If you're looking for meat that has been smoked to perfection, you should consider another barbecue joint as the staff say this is an intentional  choice of the owners and will not change."}
{"text":"Electric Mud is electrifyingly delicious! The chefs know how to cure, cook and create the sauciest most tender proteins in Toronto. Ribs to bellies, ears and tails, nothing goes to waste and nothing short on taste! The portion sizes won't bother you because your tongue will be exploding with meaty, mouth watering, zesty magnificence. Their menu is fresh, original and always includes an intriguing nightly special that exposes the chefs delicate preparation techniques. Even the desserts are nothing short of culinary milestones in post dinner delights.   Service is great and to accompany your meal, Mud offers a gamut of bourbons, specialty cocktails and craft beers to sooth your pallet.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"3.5/5 - Overall good food, but nothing special.  My girlfriend and I shared the BBQ Plate ($35.99). For two people who were decently hungry, it was just right.   The plate included the following items: Brisket: Good, not great. Nice outside crust, but the meat was not juicy throughout. At times, it was a bit tougher than brisket should be. Pork Ribs: Pretty good. A very nice dry rub was on the ribs, which allowed for the meat's juices to really stand out in my mind.  Chicken Wings: Probably the best thing on the plate. Again, the dry rub was great, and the chicken itself was quite moist. Pulled Pork: Good level of spiciness for Pulled Pork. Tasty, but it was not pulled well - some parts were way too clumpy.  Coleslaw: Fairly below-average. Not creamy enough, and the vegetables used were not fresh or crispy at all.  Potato Salad: Typical potato salad. Nice creaminess but could have used a bit more seasoning.  Not a bad spot, and the value was decent for the quantity of food we got. However, there are definitely better BBQ places in the city (namely, Adamson BBQ in Leaside) that I would push much more than Electric Mud."}
{"text":"Got the fried chicken and smoked pork ribs. The chicken is by far my favourite in the GTA! Really crispy and juicy. Comes with some cool. unique sauces, but I love straight hot sauce.  The ribs were pretty good but for me the portion is a bit small. The smoking on the ribs was done right though.  For sure going back to get more chicken and try the beef ribs.  Cool atmosphere but be prepared to smell like BBQ for the next 24 hrs, but what's wrong with that?"}
{"text":"came starving, left hungry. and broke.  maybe it's because I've spent a lot of time in the South but to my mind, BBQ is supposed to be a cheap way to get stuffed and bring some home for the dog. sides are always piled high and come with the food as a matter of course. servers are friendly and will only stop feeding you when you cry uncle.  but at Electric Mud, you get a main, which is like two ribs or a piece of catfish the size of a loonie. then you pay extra for these tiny sample-size sides, lackluster imitations of the traditional offerings. the service was too cool for school. and holy shit, overpriced.  basically: I've had the real thing and this ain't it. try again, Toronto."}
{"text":"I highly recommend eating here! The Porch Crawler is my favorite drink to get here, not a huge drinker myself but it's a delicious summery beverage, even if it's not summer. I love the tapas style portions so you get to try more things. The staff are super helpful in suggesting items, I have a nut allergy and ordered something that I didn't think would have nuts (the collard greens!), the waitress came back after taking our order just to double check that was ok thankfully!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious! I went with a group of 6 and we tried almost all the items on the menu. There's the everyday menu on the wall and then there's a hand written photocopied menu which includes dishes that I believe they put on rotation.   Must get: pork rinds (but I would save this for the end because it is extremely hot!!! We ate this first and our tastebuds were in overdrive), pork belly and the Sheila salad!  The restaurant is really small. Probably seats almost 30 including bar seats. Once the patio is open, they'll be able to accommodate a bit more people.   2 of us got there at 5:30 and understandably they didn't seat us because the rest of the party was there. In total we waited 40 min which wasn't too bad. The staff was really nice!"}
{"text":"We ordered the crack rolls to start with and they were still warm when they arrived to our table. The best part is the spread that the rolls comes with, which includes some sort of fat drippings (aka is delicious).   For our main course we shared the ribs, pork belly, and shrimp and grits between the two of us. There were four ribs in the entree, and they had a delicious flavour with a bit of a kick and peanuts on top for a nice crunch. The pork belly was good but I don't know if I would order it again. The shrimp and grits were delish! Had no idea what to expect but it turned out to be my favourite part of the meal. We ordered the coleslaw on the side which wasn't super creamy, but had a light tangy dressing, wasn't anything special but it was good.   The atmosphere was very casual, super cool, playing old school rock. The waiters were super friendly and offered some great recommendations. Overall experience was great, I'll definitely go back. I know some people say the portions are small but I think ordering a bunch and sharing them is the way to go, I was stuffed by the end!"}
{"text":"went a million times this summer. so so so so so good. everything we tried something new we loved it. the brisket. the fried chicken. the ribs. now i'm hungry"}
{"text":"Terrific place to go for a chill dinner with friends. We went on a Saturday and decided to get there for when it opened at 5.  That was the thing to do since it is very small inside.  There is a tented outside space, but that's not so great on a cold day like today. We wanted to try the menu as much as possible, so we ordered a lot in order to share everything.  We had the crack rolls, pork rinds, squid po boy, pulled pork bun, beef brisket bun, ribs, rib ends, fried chicken, shrimp and grits, sweet potato pudding, buttermilk pie and banana cream.  We also had few of their cocktails. Our favourites were the rib ends and all the buns, but everything was pretty tasty.  If I had to leave something out, it would be the ribs.  It was tasty but not awesome. Recommend the restaurant highly. It is cash only."}
{"text":"We came with my 2 yrs old nephew and it was fiiineee .. he continue sleeping like a little boy while we enjoyed the sample plate.. good to try!"}
{"text":"Almost everything my buddy and I ate here was fantastic. The fried chicken was absolutely unreal! I thought the ribs could have been more tender, but other than that, the chicken, rib ends, coleslaw, potato salad and dessert were excellent. Loses a star for having to wait in line - as I get older I'm less inclined to do any sort of line-waiting."}
{"text":"I'm breaking with tradition here and reviewing an establishment that already has more than 20 reviews. This will probably get lost in the shuffle somewhere but hopefully enough people will see it that the warning will stick. Here goes...  Finally broke down and gave this place a shot and while I have to say Electric Mud makes the only grits I have ever had that didn't taste like wet cigarettes in spit, I wasn't really blown away by anything else. For the record, the grits were actually really really good but two shrimp and grits for $13.50 is quite literally robbery.  We had the pork ribs, grits, fried chicken, pickles, a boozy lemonade and a beergarita and as mentioned before, the only thing that I really enjoyed were the grits. The chicken is tasty but panko fried chicken feels like it's been done to death. The ribs were more fat and bone than meat but the meat that was there was tender and juicy.  My one and only real problem with Electric Mud is that I'm tired of places selling blue collar food at ridiculous prices. This has to stop, really. Maybe it's just supposed to be kitschy and fun or something for people that haven't had soul food (or something close to it) but this stuff is supposed to be filling, good and inexpensive. That's how it works. When I can eat at a truck stop and have better fried chicken or go to a hole in the wall for better ribs, that tells me you are doing something wrong.  On the plus side, the music was good and I could actually hear the server without us screaming at each other. Grand Electric could take a page from Mud."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ made all the better by a hot summer night on the patio. Crack rolls are a must to start - some of best bread and butter in town. Two of us shared brisket and fried chicken as our mains with a side of beans, which was plenty of food; though would like to return with a group to order more and have more selection (the group of six sharing our communal table did it right).  I was expecting more from the cole slaw though.  Relying only on the very small portion served with the brisket, but it was definitely lacking - add some more dressing or vinegar or something - dry cabbage cole slaw is not.  Creative cocktails were refreshing; beer selection matches the menu and venue. Service was great to start, but fell off a bit.  No follow ups for more drinks or dessert, just \"here's the bill\" - didn't seem like they were in dire need of our seats.  We were not there to linger and had to head to a concert, but were not in a rush and probably would have ordered more."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!! Well worth the wait to get a table!!  If anyone is having a bbq craving, you HAVE TO GO HERE! I've had the ribs, fried chicken, smoked chicken, sausages, corn, collard greens, coleslaw, and potato salad and nothing has disappointed me yet.  The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that its just soo small and I wished it was larger so the wait wouldn't have to be so long (if you go during the dinner rush)"}
{"text":"Waited for about 20 minutes for a table on a Wednesday night, but let me tell you, it's worth the wait for delicious BBQ!  The restaurant ambiance is super laid back, and staff is friendly. A great selection of beers and bourbon cocktails (that are quite strong). Bourbonade, try it. YUM.  There is a simple menu, BBQ mains, side dishes and desserts. Most dishes are good to share so we ordered different items so we can try a little bit of everything. It was hard to pick a favorite on the menu, so I recommend the Pork Belly, Fried Chicken (not super greasy and its boneless), corn on the cob and the mud pie.  Quick tip: make sure you have cash (though they have an ATM if needed) as they only take cash, and they do not split bills."}
{"text":"My only piece of advice: GET THE FRIED GREEN TOMATOES!!!  Holy food epiphany! This was quite literally one of the best things I have eaten in a long time. The contrast between the crunchy coating of the tomato and the smooth and tangy pimento cheese; the spicy pickled jalapeños and sweet pickled onions was just mind blasting!  It was on the Specials menu, but I hope they make it a permanent fixture, because it's that good. My friend and I agreed that we would have skipped everything else and just ordered 5 of these. Ahhh, so drool worthy!  We had the Fried Chicken with KFC-esque Gravy, and hot sauce. The chicken had a steamed quality to it on the inside, and unfortunately the crispy coating could not make up for it. Not my fave dish. The Stockyards is still is my #1!  The Pork Ribs had a complex BBQ sauce glazed over them. Pretty tasty and pretty to look at, but not fall off the bone good, as one would hope with ribs.  The Collard Greens and Coleslaw were okay. I felt the slaw was a tad over dressed, but the flavour was good.  Borrowed from their sister restaurant Grand Electric, the Banana Cream Pie comes stacked in a cute little mason jar: Graham Crumbs, Banana Pudding, Whipped Cream. Do not deny yourself dessert when you come here, it's treason. The intensity of the Banana flavour was just wild. My friend who refused to have dessert, couldn't help but dip his spoon in, and was blown away.  If you are a meat lover, you'll enjoy exploring the menu here!"}
{"text":"Being from the south I was surprised to find such fantastic fried chicken here! Wash that down with their sweet tea and you are good to go. That said their ribs aren't the greatest and sadly they are only open during dinner. I love the atmosphere and would definitely come again for that chicken!"}
{"text":"Everyone has to eat here.  There has never been a restaurant where Every Bite I Consume, EVERY TIME I go there, makes me declare YUM out loud.  The flavors really hit the sweet spot of Toronto cuisine and the Fried Chicken is the BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN THE CITY. Order it with Buffalo Cauliflower and you're set!!   I've been over a dozen times and it never gets old."}
{"text":"I went to Electric Mud in the first couple weeks it was opened and did not have a great experience, the food was ok, very fatty and expensive, it was very loud and very busy.  I went back two weeks ago to give it another chance and had a similar experience unfortunately, the patio was closed because it was winter and half the menu was sold out by 8 pm.  I did really enjoy the fried chicken and slaw, the pig tails were extremely fatty, overall I had a decent experience but the food still was just average to me."}
{"text":"Great food, ethically conscious minded ingredients and friendly staff. Large selection of wiskeys to suit the mood. Highly recommended. Mac and cheese was the perfect side."}
{"text":"This place is tasty.  The apps we ordered got us off to an ok start, but the mains were out of this world. We started with the crack rolls (bread with smoked butter) and the rinds.   Bread was standard (similar to the white bread you find at a Chinese bakery), the smoked butter was definitely tasty, but it was pricey bread at almost $4. Rinds were great - definitely got a kick to them with the halapeno seasoning.   Pork neck was super tasty. Reminded me of a smokey lemongrass pork chop - not complaining. Ribs (Carolina style) were so tender and moist, and the sauce with the green onion came together really well. yummy. Fried chicken was so tender and juicy, and the sauce (I have no clue what it was) was incredible. I know some people will ask, was the chicken better than Stockyards - honestly, I don't know. I don't think so, but it's pretty close.   Had the corn cake for dessert - not really impressed, it was a bit dry and I was expecting more as a huge corn/cornmeal food product fan.   Portions in general are a tad small, but I don't think it's meant to be a gorgefest anyways. So delicious."}
{"text":"MY FAV!  So good! the place is cute and cozy and the food is to die for. Some of the best BBQ in town. The service was really good too!  I would recommend this place to anyone. I ate SO much it was hard to walk afterwards :). Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was so-so and using paper cups in house was pretty disappointing. Overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I shared a number of menu items with a group and had the special of the day (which it truly was) we shared several orders of the crack rolls, pork rinds, beef brisket, cowboy beef rib, fried chicken, buffalo cauliflower. All of it was amazing (am salivating at the memory) but stand out for me was the buffalo cauliflower and I am a meatatarian (it's a personal choice)   For sure a repeat place to go. Enjoyed sitting outside more than inside."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me to electric mud and I was so impressed with the food. The crack rolls are named perfectly as they are addictive! They serve the soft warm rolls with butter and it literally melts in your mouth. We had the fried chicken and beef ribs- to die for!! The fried chicken was well seasoned and the gravy/sauce that comes with it is not over powering but simply full of flavour. The ribs have a dry rub on top , served with bbq sauce on the side (awesome!) and the beef is very tender. I go to tons of rib places and ribfest in Toronto and nothing compares to this place. I'll definitely return - soon!"}
{"text":"Love the beef brisket sammy! It is packed with allllll kinds of flavors! Place is super busy & its small. I always have to take my food to go."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here last night. Sat on the heated patio at one of the shared tables... ribs, links, pickled green tomatoes, roasted cauliflower... it was all great. Service was attentive and professional. Wish I had come here a long time ago! Also, lots of options for people following low carb diets. :-)"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for Valentine's Day. When you walk in it may seem like a bit of a dive but from the minute you get in you are taken care of by an amazing staff. The food is the best I have had. It has lots of flavour and the portions are enough to share. It will leave you wanting more. One thing about the place is that the ventilation is not the best and you will come out smelling like smoked meat. But don't let that stop you from enjoying this place."}
{"text":"Not too amazing of a bbq place. The ambiance was okay but I thought there could have been more of that real bbq flavor as opposed to the simple bbq sauce flavor that you can buy in a store for a fee bucks."}
{"text":"Went for a relaxed dinner before a show last night with a party of 4. $2.50 pints on Mondays - excellent start to the night. Love the space, the service is knowledgable, thoughtful and no nonsense - very casual in a fast paced atmosphere. We ordered the crack rolls - so soft and the butter is deliciously smoky; the pork rinds - they're good, crunchy as they should be and the dip is just amazing; cowboy beef rib - big enough to split-tender & smoky; fried chicken was good - the sauce was incredible; and shrimp and grits - my personal favourite of the night.  Overall I'd come back for sure and try some more items. Small menu makes it easy to keep coming back to sample.  Tip - sit outside on the covered deck - sometimes the kitchen gets a little smoked out and essentially you're sitting in it if you're inside."}
{"text":"No subtractions, oh you have a a dairy allergy? Sorry we cant NOT put cheese on your salad. Ribs were roughly 50% meat 50% fat/grissel. Server forgot about us for quite a while. Ive had better BBQ from a hotdog vendor on the street"}
{"text":"Gotta be the best BBQ in TO.  Two of us were served a whole pile of food, two drinks each, and the bill was under $75...that's pretty great for the service, quality of food, and overall experience.   Tried much of the menu, but the standout favorites were the fried chicken (best I've had in the city), the ribs (great for sharing), the buns, and the pig tails.   I've never had fried pigtails before. They were long and straight instead of curly like in the cartoons. Tasted like chicken wings, but much fattier.   They serve Schlitz which is makes me laugh. And all beer is available in pitchers which is a nice touch. Waitstaff all very helpful, friendly, and fun.   PS The Brock ave. LCBO is right next-door so those Grand waits go by pretty fast..."}
{"text":"Excellent service, me and my bf came here one night just cuz we were hungry.. The food was so tasty and full of flavor oh man so good! MUST TRY ! we did wait a bit to get seated but hey its worth it! definately coming back for that fried chicken and ribs. i actuallt wish i could express the flavour to your guys. Great job electric mud (y)"}
{"text":"Great brisket sandwich and corn! Def worth it."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday evening at about 5:30pm. No line up and there were plenty of seats on the patio (we went during late summer). Their Fried Chicken was absolutely amazing and is definitely one of my favourites! It was so flavourful, crispy and tasty! Their ribs were also amazing!"}
{"text":"The first step to solving a problem is admitting that you have a problem. Well, here it is. I order in from Electric Mud BBQ way too much... but I don't even want it to stop. In fact, the only reason why it is a problem is that whenever I do go into the establishment, I am reminded that food is EVEN BETTER in person. It's not that far, so I doesn't really make sense. But sometimes, desperate times call for desperate measures!   In person, you'll find this to be a significantly above average BBQ joint. The atmosphere is inviting, with picnic tables and splendid scents that waft down Brock Ave. Don't miss the fried chicken and buffalo-fried cauliflower (this is an item that you can only get by going to the restaurant. I know. I tried). The crack rolls are carb crack. The baked beans are sweet, yet meaty. The potato salad is topped with hickory sticks. I mean, COME ON.   More uniquely, I recently got in touch with Electric Mud directly and they catered a professional function. They were marvelous to work with, responding to every email in a flash and offering creative menu items to satisfy a diverse crowd. Special care was especially shown when it came to allergies and preferences. They ended up marking everyone's name on the boxes of BBQ so everything was easy to sort and custom made, just for you. They prepared the allergy-sensitive items first so those meals wouldn't be contaminated, and stored those BBQ boxes separately. Taking every precaution that they did was very thoughtful and really allowed everyone to have a stress-free experience. They went above and beyond in every way.   See you soon, in my home or yours, Electric Mudd."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here, everything is marvelous~  the fried chicken,  the brisket sandwich, the rib ends~~~ esp on mondays for the cheap beers,  electric mud is my happy place!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately disappointed. With so many great BBQ places in the city, this one fell short. We ordered the whole menu and the best items were the broccoli and cauliflower which I think says a lot. Everything was full of onion and spices and rubs didn't seem to match their meat pairing, all the meats had an overwhelming taste.   Service was great, place is tiny so you're sitting on top of each other."}
{"text":"We were able to get in, because they had just extended some hours to Saturday lunch. We split on some bbq corn and the beef strip plate. The food was really good! I considered the beer to be too expensive, and the portion on the main dish a tad small. I don't even think they it was a whole pint of beer... also the place is really small... if not for these things I might be giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"THE SAD TRUTH!!!  Friendly staff, minus our bitchy waitress, like everyone said but the food is disappointing at best.  $18 for 5 pieces of pork ribs and it wasn't fall off the bone or finger licking good, the meat was still slightly red/pink on the inside.  You actually had to eat it with the house BBQ sauce for flavor.  $10.50 for 6 pieces of fried cauliflower...yes, cauliflower that $1.99 in stores.  $5 for 4 pieces of baby-fist-size dinner roll plus garlic butter.  Pulled pork sandwich was good.  Chicken plate was just 1 costco sizes deep fried chicken breast cut in half.  Without the gravy sauce, it lacked flavor on its own.  The decor was interesting with the whole hole-in-the-wall concept but the prices are  ridiculous with the portion size, even for Toronto standard.  There are altertives in Toronto but I will be professional enough not to mention them here, and just maybe not with ALL their menu options in one place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place quite a bit.  Our server was nice.  The beers are pretty good.  I didn't find it was outrageously expensive compared to other restaurants in Toronto, and we were full (2 mains, 2 sides, 3 drinks) for $80 plus tip.  Maybe there are cheaper barbeque places around."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time over the weekend. Cool spot with lots of retro decor. We sat on the heated patio which is covered during the winter but would love to come back during the summer when its opened up. Small menu of shareable dishes but what they do have on there, they have completely mastered (they state on the menu that any requests for changes or modifications will be politely declined so if you're a fussy eater, beware). We had the crack rolls, the pork ribs, the chicken wings, the brisket, the broccoli salad, the cauliflower salad & two sides of coleslaw. Everything was unbelievably delicious! There were 5 of us and this was more than enough food for everyone. Didn't get to try the cocktails or the fried chicken but that's for next time!"}
{"text":"Not the biggest portions but what they lack in quantity they make up for with creativity. My absolute fav was the beef brisket sandwich. The brisket was slow cooked to pink perfection, and the sandwich was saucy with just the right flavours in there. I also enjoyed the smoked tongue - if you're feeling a bit squeamish about tongue, don't worry, they shave it so thin it could be any meat. The only minor complaint I have with these two dishes is that the meat isn't substantial enough in either of them. When I think of BBQ, I think of loads of meat! And no matter how creative you get with the prep, I just don't feel like you can get away from that. For dessert, the buttermilk pie was a perfect meal ender. Not too sweet and super thin crust.  The seating is at picnic tables which are communal, at least on the patio, and the servers are helpful and right on top of things.  The meal ended up costing $75 for two people, and we left quite full with four dishes, one side, two drinks, and dessert under our belts."}
{"text":"Came to this place tonight bc we had such a great experience at their sister resto \"grand electric\". Sorry to say but it was quite disappointing. if im paying 16.50 plus tax for 3 beef ribs then im expecting some spectacular flavors -- nope it was mediocre. Everything we ordered was mediocre and overpriced (bc it was just average). What really bothered me the most was that not only my food was smoked but my entire wardrobe and hair got smoked too! thank god we werent going anywhere else after bc i definitely had to have a shower as soon as i got home!"}
{"text":"I live up the street so when my favourite burger joint Bison Burger closed, I was eager to see what would take it's place. Welcome to the hood, Electric Mud BBQ! The food here is amazing. The service is awesome. Music is loud. Atmosphere is fun. If you are reading this and wondering if you should go...just go."}
{"text":"Things to know: cash only, and no reservations. In short, the place is a dump, loud obnoxious music played, and the service was medicine to bad, but yes the food is good. And it is NOT expensive. Our party of 4 had 2 appies, 4 mains, 4 sides, 2 desserts and non-alcoholic bev's was $90 tax & tip in; small portions but we shared and didn't leave hungry or overstuffed. So in terms of decor it is grunge hipster - concrete floors that tile was removed from, plywood walls, crappy tables and uncomfortable chairs. I am no princess, but it was gross.  Kitchen is visible which is ok except tons of smoke frequently overtook the crowded dining area. I like BBQ but I don't want to eat in an enclosed kitchen - backyard ok, but not inside.  There is an outdoor patio but it was full and everyone was eating their coats in April. If you want great BBQ in a nicer environment go over to Barque on Roncesvalles, you'll pay double but larger portions and the ribs are better. So I guess if you are on a budget and you're with like-minded people who you're not trying to impress give Electric Mud a shot. $4 bourbon shots if ur into that, but I came to eat."}
{"text":"This place feels like it's straight out of the south.  Spicy. Messy. Delicious.   After a bit of a wait for a table ( this place is busy!) we managed to get two seats at the bar. We were eating late and at that point they had already run out of a couple of things from the menu. We had two very awesome servings of wings with some spicy and delicious flavors, beef ribs and broccoli.   They have an awesome but tiny patio.   Definitely worth a visit to Parkdale to check this little gem out."}
{"text":"Preeeetty good.  I've come here a few times so I always get the same things: crack rolls, fried chicken, pork rinds, and a side of corn.  Pro tip: order a variety of things and share it. The portions are JUST large enough to share it with a few people. You won't leave feeling totally stuffed but you will be satisfied.  Crack rolls make me feel guilty they're so good and buttery. They come in four. They're so soft and warm and the whipped butter is to die for. I often just eat the leftover butter because yeah it's gross but it tastes so good stop judging me. Also the butter is not vegetarian for anyone who is veg.  Pork rinds are crispy and flavorful but spicy. It's just on the upper threshold of the average person's spice tolerance. I like spicy food but don't have a great tolerance, but I still love it. Some people I've shared it with can't take more than a couple.  A few can't eat it at all.  Fried chicken -  crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Comes in a decently sized portion, definitely share this one. A crowd favorite.  Corn - it's cheap compared to everything else on the table and the sauce on top is pretty good. A lot of people like to crack it in half and share it.   WHAT ABOUT THE RIBS?  I know this is a BBQ place but the ribs are underwhelming. Two individual ribs and they're one of the most expensive things on the menu. Not really tender fall off the bone meat, and no finger kicking good BBQ sauce. Everything about it was 'meh'.  Others - veg SO likes the Buffalo cauliflower a lot. The Montreal sandwich was... messy. But good ! Person who ordered it one time couldn't finish it. Last time I came here I got the oysters. It's 3 for 11.50. One complained that it just tasted like they slurped butter. I liked mine a lot but I agree that there was a bit too much butter and would have liked to taste more of the oyster. I'd probably get it again.   The in house beers are..... not great. They taste better than most cheap beers but no one I've taken to this restaurant seem like it very much. I don't like ordering it because the food is so good but the beer doesn't do it any justice. On Mondays it's 2.50 a pint though.  As for decor and atmosphere, I hate it. The presentation with the food and slightly steep prices contradicts the sort of .. shack  (at least dive bars can be really cool) feel this place has going on. The walls are particle board and it just feels like they really tried to cram way too many tables into there, which they did because it's a pain in the ass to actually sit at the tables."}
{"text":"finally made it to Electric Mud.  I was very impressed.  We started with the spicy pork rinds and dip.  These went really well with our beer.  I had Junction dark lager, my friend had some other local brew.  Then we ordered pork ribs to share, one sausage to share, and three sides, beans, potato salad, and coleslaw.  This was more than enough to share.  The only complaint we had was that the potato salad was really bland.   The music is great, and sharing a picnic table is more private than you would think, however we did have a great conversation with our table partners.  I can't wait to go back.  I have to try the chicken."}
{"text":"Went back with a friend from out of town because it was nearby after being told Electric Grand was a 2 hour wait.  I can reconfirm that the friend chicken is the best thing they serve.  The crack roll is pretty good though as is their Aqua beer drink.  The beef rib is just ok, but nothing special.  It's actually quite expensive for such a small portion of meat."}
{"text":"I personally prefer classic ribs* however they are different but i find the sauces too strong on both the pork ribs and dry beef ribs* the veggies we ordered also had too sour strong taste saucing*  The service was below average for that time i was there* they are nit good with organizing tables to avoid waiting lines*   But its a hipster cool place for a snack and beer i would agree for my bf*~"}
{"text":"Food was actually very tasty.  I don't remember the exact name of the items we ordered, but it was a pull pork sandwich, fried chicken and something else.  The sauce that was on the food was very good.  The pricing was a little on the high side considering the seating was very uncomfortable and people waiting for food or the servers were constantly jabbing me in the back.  Very limited space to hang your coats in the winter.  I would go back in the summer to check it out. Oh and my date and I saw one of the cooks tasting the desert he was making but he put the entire spoon in his mouth...he later used the same spoon and did the same thing.  Cooks should taste their food but this was little more than that."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ! Loved the ribs and fried chicken It's a bit pricey and the portions are small for a BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the portions are small, especially given the price. You'll need to have a few shared plates."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about this restaurant since it's a sister restaurant of Grand Electric. Grand Electric tacos are amazing, and the food here at Electric Mud Bbq was also far from disappointing.   The atmosphere was very unique. We were seated at picnic tables and the wall décor was lined with outdoor wilderness themes. The cozy restaurant felt like a combination of a trailer camp meets open concept bar/kitchen.     I came here with two other friends and we shared the following dishes:   BBQ Ribs: Delicious. Very meaty, with the perfect amount of smoky bbq sauce. The meat fell off the bones and completely melted in our mouths. I highly recommend trying these.   Pork Belly Pastrami: This was god like fatty meat served on bread. It reminded me of the braised pork dish that Chinese restaurants serve. I typically don't like fatty meat, but this is also must try. The pork is very tender and perfectly bbqed. The bread balances out the fattiness from the meat.   Pig Ear and Egg: Crunchy. Tasted like deep-fried crunchy pork with a runny egg served on top. This dish wasn't too unique in terms of taste, but it was deep-fried, and typically anything deep-fried is pretty good.  Roasted Cauliflower: This was a recommendation from our server. It was good, but not as interesting as our server made it sound. It was simply seasoned, roasted cauliflower served with a sweet, smoky dipping sauce.   Crack Rolls: Typical bread rolls served with a whipped smoky butter.  Portion sizes were generous and I recommend sharing the dishes with friends in order to try out more items on the menu. Show up early to avoid a long waiting time. My friends and I arrived at 8:30PM on a Friday night and did not get seated until 11PM (although we restaurant/ bar hopped during the waiting time to keep our mouths and bellies satisfied during the wait).    My overall rating:   Food: 8/10 - averaged.  Atmosphere: 8/10, cool theme, but the restaurant was definitely a bit too crowded for my liking. I was almost touching elbows with the table beside us.   Service: 10/10, no complaints. Our server was knowledgeable and great with the water refills.   I highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"From what I've heard about Electric Mud (and my experiences at Grand Electric), I was shocked as the two of us were seated at the bar after only a short 5 minute wait on Saturday night! My thought is that going out on the first week of January is great because all of those resolutioners are resoluting to either A)not spend money or B)be careful what they eat. Either way it was a big WIN for us.   We sat at the bar, which is kind of smoky, not that I was bothered. It was actually a great experience because we had the pleasure of watching all of the apps and deserts be prepared. We ordered a pitcher of Bourbonnade which was refreshing, perhaps a little watery.   We were instructed to order family style, as things come out as they are ready. This is actually a fun way to eat, its relaxed and you know you are getting your food at it's peak, which I truly appreciate!   Beef Brisket. Amazing! juicy, drippy, saucy + fried onions + the most tender beef  Crack Rolls. How could you go wrong?! soft+ butter + more smoked butter  Fried Chicken. Another win. juicy +crispy + amazing crunch + gravy + sweetness  Spicy Pickled Green Tomatoes. These were great, however too much for just the two of us, I felt wasteful. I would order these again with a larger group, as they had great flavour. Pickled+ Hot +Cold  Beef Rib. I was happy with the beef rib, however it's a more pricey item (M.P. was $16) and it really only delivers a couple of bites. Totally delicious, but probably would skip next time. extremely tender + charred bits + great sauce + smoke  And after a little boubonnade break, we were ready to tackle a dessert.   Buttermilk Pie. OMG. sour cream whipped cream + THE flakiest crust + smooth tartness. I just can't even get over it, and that happened 3 days ago...  Overall definitely one of the best meals I've ever had. It is a must try experience, even if you have to wait!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is incredible! I just moved to the city, and had a couple friends coming to visit. After asking around at work where to eat while they were here, a few ppl raved about this tiny, unassuming BBQ spot in the city. We sat at out picnic table on a sunny afternoon, not sure what to expect. We ordered the sampler, some corn, and drinks, cause might as well try it all. Everything was amazing. It was all we could do to not keep ordering more and more. Highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"*sigh* -- a succinct summary of my experience here.   I know this place has been hyped up blah blah blah so maybe it was a one-time flop, who's to say really. casual double date, were hanging out up the street - what could go wrong?! But, something just doesn't add up about this place.  -Don't call it communal eating if you get like, three ribs in an order. We can't even try one each between the four of us.  -coleslaw arrived like...5mins after we finished everything we had already ordered. Cool. -The sandwiches are akin to getting a taco's worth of food ....for +$$. Non merci. -Best of the food = pulled pork sandwich. Worst = smoked catfish roll (tuna salad/school lunch reminiscent)  TLDR: weird system for ordering/serving, contemplating prices while eating with ikea cutlery off plastic plates, one of us left hangry, coming to terms with the fact that i've been spending 2 much time in parkdale."}
{"text":"Drinks are overpriced  Food is amazing Omg their crack rolls are literally addictive and no matter how full you are you just need more!!! I tried the ribs... Too dry and just alright could have been better however their beef brisket is amazing!!!!! I wanna Ty the catfish but let's see... Really chilled spot and nice location.  They should renovate it to add more room so there's not really any waiting time... And also extend their hours!  However really good place and will go there again!"}
{"text":"Damn good.    Boyfriend and I ordered a ton of food... it came to a not so crazy price.    Everything was in generous portions.  Savoury, and multi-layer flavours... the shrimp I ordered were on top of a corn porridge that tasted of maple syrup and bacon... mouthwatering!  The atmosphere is a little disappointing but for the size of the place and the way the food tastes it provides a different kind of feeling that you don't usually get at a place to eat.  It's definitely not a classic dining experience, be open minded!  It's very fun, but not ultra romantic... but we didn't go for the romance, we went for the pork rinds.    The waitstaff was alright, we had 4 different staff... a little hectic... but it IS busy, so that's okay.  Everyone who served was awesome except one woman who, when I asked about if something I was ordering was gluten-free seemed totally uninterested and uninformative.  A very \"whatever\" attitude.  I'm not a celiac, I just avoid gluten... Anyways, her response was very \"yeah yeah whatever\" when I asked.  I felt annoying voicing my concern to her... like I should *know* what they use to cook with.  I would have given 5/5 but her attitude really sucked.  We will go back but next time I'll make sure to only order items I don't need to ask questions over."}
{"text":"So unfortunately, when we went they were out of 3 things - 3 of which we wanted to try. So we had to try the burger. I'd be curious to come back and try the things they were out of (ie. rib ends).  The burger was pretty good and juicy. The sauce had very very very mild spicy flavour, and spice isn't my go to thing to eat. Although most might not even notice, but I do! The flavour of that sauce wasn't my fave either. But the fries were amazing, and the crack rolls were so so sooo good!"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place out for a while as I really enjoy southern comfort style food. We went after work so I wanted to take it to go. As we waited for our items I noticed how quickly the place filled up. Get here right as it opens if you don't want to wait.  The food smelled so good I really wanted to dive across people's tables to devour whatever they ordered. I swear to God the only thing that prevented me from ordering one of everything on the menu was the shame and potential judgement I would have felt. I need to return to order everything else I didn't order this time. Tried the crack rolls (OMG with this smokey sweet butter!), the Pork Ribs (delish!!!!!), the coleslaw, the potato salad, the squid po'boy and the fried chicken (crispy AND moist).   The place was definitely packed with young hipster looking people but it was a casual atmosphere that would definitely be fun with friends or people visiting from out of town. A lot of the dishes are perfect for sharing so if you go with a group definitely order a little of everything and share.  Of the items above that I ordered I would say the crack rolls and the Pork Ribs were my favorite. Like instant pleasure the moment it hits your lips.  Definitely want to go back.  Makes me want to try their sister restaurant down the street - Grand Electric for tacos!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best as far as bbq goes. Not bad, but far from deserving the hype that queen street hipsters give this joint. The incredibly bad service is what really blew my mind. At one point we were asked to move to a different table (because we were only 2) by the door and it was a very cold winter evening. We said no thanks and got a \"pshhh\" from the server!!  Unbelievable.  If you want to overpay for shitty bbq and deal with obnoxious hipster attitude, this is the place for you...  but never again for me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants to order from through Uber Eats.  The food is delicious, the service is quick, but perhaps it's a little pricey for what you get.    Favourites include the brisket sandwich with the crispy onions, and the beef bones with a most delicious spice rub.  The crack rolls are okay, but a good starter, and the pulled pork sandwich is also tasty with a nice, tangy slaw.  The quantities are a little small, considering the price.    I can't comment on the restaurant itself as we've only done Uber Eats."}
{"text":"BBQ Heaven - Best BBQ in Toronto!  I first arrived on Tuesday only to discover they are closed on Tuesday's. My group returned the next day and scored a picnic table on the patio after a 20 minute wait.  The menu is basic BBQ mains, side dishes and some specialty items. Most dishes are good to share so we ordered many different items. A quick rundown:  - Crackrolls:  Basic bread but served with butter whipped with the drippings from the smoker. Delicious and the perfect BBQ starter.  - Shrimp and grits: On the special menu, not bad but I wouldn't order it again..  - Smoked Ham: So good, kind of like Prosciutto. Served with fresh baguette. This is best to share as it's a bit salty, not sure I would enjoy the entire dish. Served with a pea spread.  - Pork Ribs: The only real miss for me. You get 3 ribs for $15 but the meat is really fatty. I didn't enjoy these at all (we even wasted two ribs).  - Beef ribs:  exactly the opposite of the Pork ribs, filled with delicious meat and smokey flavour. You only get one for $14.99. Meat melts in your mouth.  - HotLinks: Smoked Italian sausage was amazing. Melted in your mouth with a nice spice kick. Served with a tangy BBQ sauce.  - Fried Chicken: No bones and also very good. Chicken thighs and breast were nice and crispy but not oily at all.   - Sides were excellent. Best baked beans ever! Cole slaw was also a stand-out.. Portions are good to share.  - The table next to me ordered the brisket sandwich and it looked amazing. I will try this next time.   They had a few interesting beers on tap which rotates regularly. Cocktails are good but very strong and largely Bourbon based.   Highly recommended but go early to avoid line-ups. They take cash only."}
{"text":"This place has a hip vibe and is busy, which my friends and I thought would be a good thing. Turns out that it's not all that great. We waited 20 mins for a table. They were sold out of ribs, which was the first disappointment. Then we had to ask specifically for cutlery in order to eat our food. The Squid Po' Boy sandwich ($6.50) was very good, and we got the sides of baked beans and collard greens ($3 each, beans were good but collards were very salty) But the server forgot to enter my friend's main order!!! Despite her error, she still charged my friend the full price for the rest of her order, so it ended up being $20 for two sides and a Caesar, with no main. The server offered to make the order to go, but we didn't want to wait another 20 mins. We thought my friend should have at least been offered some sort of discount, but no. The fake-roadhouse theme is kind of fun, and the food is good when you can get it, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"When Electric Mud opened, it was much more rare to find such design and such atmosphere in the city. Their food is the best I have had and even though I have been there a few times they never disappoint. They also make it very easy to share food!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on Monday, who had always wanted to try it.  I have mixed feelings about Electric Mud`s bigger, more famous brother, the `Grand Electric`, that darling of the Toronto food scene, but figured what the hey.... At 6 pm when the gates opened there was already a line... I`m not sure how much this was influenced by the $2.50 beer special on Mondays, which was a pleasant surprise.  Ambiance was kinda rural hipster.. The music was good, with a cd of the Band playing (the Band... which band... no no no the Band....) and interesting decor including 1970s pin ups and a  stuffed ostrich over the stairs up to the washrooms  After sitting down at one of the picnicking benches and wetting the whistle wiht some of the aforementioned beer, My buddy and I ordered Pork Rinds, Crack Rolls for our starters, and he got the special Beef Sandwich for dinner. I opted for the Pork Side Ribs. We also got a side of Coleslaw.  I`ll break down each item individually. Crack Rolls: 3.75 for some decent rolls and smoked butter... 5 out of 10 Pork Rinds: Flaky, yummy pork rinds with really spicy Tabasco and pimento cheese... yum yum! 8/10 Coleslaw: Average and a small side plate portion: 3/10 Beef Sandwich: Cheesy, tasty, good size 6/10 Pork Side Ribs: 3 large ribs and some sauce for $14.50. Very filling and tender 7/10  We also had the delightful company of a Portugese mother and daughter next to us, who tried most on the things on the menu, though the mother couldn't get over the lack of fries on the menu.  Looking back on my ratings, my final recommendation is this, go on a Monday, get the beer special and try some of the ribs and the rinds and avoid the sides!"}
{"text":"I was new to the neighbourhood and wanted to check out the local flavour. Stumbled upon this place as I was on the way to the LCBO. Decided to return for dinner and see what the crowds were about.  It was busy when we arrived so we took a spot at the bar. I'm glad we did because apparently this place is so good that people were actually sitting on the patio in frigid March temperatures! Ick. Even if you managed to stay semi-warm in your parka, I'm sure the food wouldn't stay warm very long out there. Brr! I was pretty happy with the bar location. Lots to see! Good views of the kitchen staff preparing all the food. Simple and quick. I had a hot apple cider which was SUPER delicious.  I wasn't too starving so I just ordered the brisket sandwich. It was really good. I'd order it again for sure.  The perfect finish was the deserts. I had the buttermilk pie and it was AHHHH-mazing. So sweet and creamy. Save room for desert, because it's worth it.  I'll definitely want to go back and try this place when it's not -20 outside."}
{"text":"I feel like the BBQ scene in Toronto was the next big thing 2-3 years ago.  Now that there are more than a handful of restaurants serving up smoked and bbqed meat, it's hard to set them apart.  Anyone who has been in south-western USA will feel at home.  Seating is tight and on picnic tables and decor screams \"hunting\".  I loved it.  Outdoor patio is covered and heated in the winter.  You'll leave with your clothes smelling smokey indoors or out.  Waitress was friendly with suggestions.  Food was fantastic.  Buffalo cauliflower - I've never tried this before but think deep friend cauliflower in buffalo sauce; what a winner.  Fried chicken was tender, boneless and had a great gravy underneath.  Side ribs were had a great taste, but the meat could have been a bit more tender.  Rib ends were sold out (right after opening? I guess it was a Sunday).  Electric lager tastes like MGD.  Try the boilermaker though."}
{"text":"Another BBQ review. This time we tried beef ribs, wings, fried chicken and the shrimp and grits. I goto Atlanta a lot and have tried a lot of grits. These are really tasty and my wife lived them. The beef ribs were also really good. The rub is excellent, more sweet than salty. The sauce tasty. The smoke ok but a bit light. Not fatty at all. The fried chicken is super moist and great. The wings are smoked and really fantastic. It a great wing with smoke to boot! Awesome.  Only downside is that portions are a bit small so if you're super hungry you'll need more than 1:1 orders.  This is a terrific place with decent draft selections and tasty food. We'll be back for certain."}
{"text":"Visited Electric Mud for the first time. What a terrific little spot. Great eclectic atmosphere, which seems to be the case for many BBQ restaurants these days. Minimalist, inexpensive decor, and chairs reminiscent of the 60's. All very comfortable, in an outdoorsy, dust-off-your-britches, kind of way.   The staff is excellent, which for me is always required for any 5 star rating, regardless of how good the food is. Friendly, helpful and as attentive as required. They set expectations (\"food will come out as it's ready\"), and even told us when to stop ordering food, and she was just right about that.   That said, we did order just about everything on the menu, leaving a few things for next time :)  When you go, be sure to order the fried chicken. It's not really an option, if you're going to Electric Mud, you must have these bite-size morsels of heaven. Trust.  The home-made sausage was also a hit, as were the rib-end bites. Personally, I make outstanding smoked pork ribs, so we didn't try them this time. I often find myself disappointed trying other's ribs, so I didn't want that to affect our experience. And that was the right call. Everything we ate, including the home-baked beans, was terrific. We ordered just enough, and remain salivating for our next visit (when, of course, we'll go for ribs).  And, and, that's not all. For a bourbon lover, this place is pure heaven. One of the most extensive whisky lists you'll find anywhere in the city. Reasonably priced, albeit they're 1-oz shots (not like the way they pour down south), but none-the-less, if there's a bourbon you have a hankering to try before you go out and buy a bottle, drop by Electric Mud, they're more than likely to have it on their list.  All around, an excellent bbq joint. We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Only downside is that it's a small place so getting a table can be tricky. Hope they expand."}
{"text":"The wings are delicious, the fried chicken is great, and all of the sandwiches are on point. The mac & cheese. Didn't really taste like cheese, and the potato salad was a little flavorless. The BBQ is definitely amazing."}
{"text":"killer pork ribs & fried chicken"}
{"text":"It's great here, BUT you have to get there early enough in the night for first pick because the menu sells out fast.  The pulled brisket is amazing, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The pig tails were fun to try but not necessarily recommended.  The name certainly suits the atmosphere. Be prepared for loud music and getting your hands dirty. This is a MUST TRY for smokehouse enthusiasts."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've puked at in the last five years. Considering how much I drink, that's probably an inaccurate statement. The food here is really really good and priced perfectly. The culprit for my shame was the 5 dollar wild turkey shots, I was totally overwhelmed by them. Great vibe and place, just wish it wasn't so cramped!"}
{"text":"(Out of 5) Food:  3.5  Service: 4.5   Atmosphere: 4   We arrived here just before 6 p.m. and the place was already 90% full. We were lucky that we got the last two seats at the bar.  Our waitress was really friendly and explained to us the menu and answered our questions.  Crack Rolls (4 out of 5) - freshly baked rolls which were warm and fresh. The special part about this was the kick-ass spread they give you. Not sure what exactly it is, but there were some green onions and a hint of bacon.. it was delish.  Pork tails (3 out of 5)  - the pork tails were deep fried and had the flavour of mild buffalo wings. Tasted like normal pork but with A LOT of fat. I prefer leaner meats, so the fat was pretty overwhelming.   Duck Ham (2.5 out of 5) - A western play on Peking Duck was what I got out of this dish. The tastes were quite similar, and being an Asian who's had pretty amazing Peking Duck, this was a little disappointing. Found the duck breast slightly tough as well.    Fried Chicken (3 out of 5) - Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The honey really accentuates the taste of the chicken. However I realized that the crispy 'skin' is actually just a battered coating and not actual chicken skin, which was probably why I thought the dish was lacking something (the taste of fried chicken skin).   Ribs (5 out of 5) - Here was the real winner of the night. Juicy, tender, with just the right amount of smokiness flavour. There was also some spiciness which wasn't over powering. The green onions and peanuts were a nice touch.  While the other dishes I had were just 'OK', the service here was good (didn't get a hipster vibe).  I would come back here just for the ribs!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this places since it is associated with Grand Electric (my favourite taco spot). The only dish that stood out enough to go back for is their fried chicken (juicy, crispy and delicious). The chicken wings and sides (mashed potatoes, coleslaw) were average. Reasonably priced for the location."}
{"text":"Not impressed with hostesses. Been here two times with empty restaurant. ..always point me to absolute  worst seating when alone.  Treated like royalty when here w with a guy."}
{"text":"Came here because my friend recommended it. It's nice if you go with a group, that way you can try a bit of everything. The plates are more family style. The fried chicken wings were delicious. Some of the best that I've tried. Crispy crunchy and the sauce was delicious. I enjoyed the beef back ribs, but the friend chicken was definitely my favourite dish of the night.  We got the Buffalo cauliflower. It was okay,  a bit too sour fire my liking. The crackling was good, but spicy. The crack rolls, were soft and fluffy. But the butter is the true star of the dish.  We also got some of the sides. I enjoyed the potato salad and coleslaw.   The buttermilk pie was delicious. I split this with my friends, definitely could have eaten this easily all myself. Even if you are full, I would recommend getting this.  The place is small, but they do have a patio so it's make it a lot bigger. Nice place to hang out for the summer. If you do have a bigger group, I'd recommend putting your name down and check out the other places in the area."}
{"text":"Best southern fried chicken I have ever had, not to mention the crack rolls which are amazing too.  I highly recommend this place if you like bbq.  Dinning room is really small so you may have to wait for a table but they are happy to take your cell number down and you can grab a drink at a bar close by until a table is ready.  During the summer there is also a small patio which is nice."}
{"text":"Finally checked out this place after months of fleeting thoughts about it.  Worth the wait and the hype.  The atmosphere, grungy class, was appropriate for the setting and neighbourhood.  Like:  The small but varied menu.  We tried lots of items, most of them appetizing and pleasing.  Good value for money in my opinion, though a couple of items were a little on the pricey side.  Service was stellar.  Dislike:  Cocktails at only 1.5 ounces but still $9.  Dessert was a little small for $6.  I would definitely come back, especially with visitors looking for a great Toronto experience.  Winter would be hard without the patio experience.  By the way - I paid with a credit card.  Must be brand new but they are accepted now."}
{"text":"So the food is good, but I was annoyed at the portion sizes. The way the menu is laid out, it looks like a regular menu with entrees, sides, etc. The prices for each item are about on par with other BBQ places, until you see the portions. When you actually get the food, the portions are more like tapas sizes.  We ordered the BBQ pork neck, which was fine, and a side of potato salad. The potato salad is absolutely awesome. Cocktails are great.  Service was great, and the place was packed, so we shared a picnic table on the patio (not a problem, I'll eat anywhere).   I may go back and try it again, now that I know the deal with how to order, but it's just as easy to hit any other BBQ joint in the city and get exactly what I'm looking for."}
{"text":"Loved the service and the outdoor harvest-table seating. Good selection of beer. The rubs on the meats and the gravy with the fried chicken were awesome. The problem was with the meats themselves - very dry. It seemed like a situation where the chap in charge of the rubs , sauces and gravy was paying attention while the bbq chap was slacking off - super dry and chewy ribs, super dry wings but you could taste great rubs on both. Could have been better but we still enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"For someone who is not a big fan on BBQ ribs, pulled pork and fried chicken....this place changed my mind! Been here a few times, the wait is a little long and they take no reservations but the vibe and food definitely make up for it!  The decor is a like a little run down shack stuffed with picnic tables inside for seating, with hill billy / grungy hipster dressed servers who are super super friendly and informative with their menu.  Just a heads up that this may require you to use your hands while eating!   My party and I ordered: Fried chicken - cooked perfectly and boneless! BBQ Pork on bun  Beef Brisket on bun Pork Side Ribs - messy but delicious Shrimp and Grits - ehh not that crazy about this one. portion is tiny, it basically tasted like bits of shrimp in mashed potatoes.  A side of coleslaw  A side of Potato Salad - favourite side Butter milk pie for dessert - TO DIE FOR.  That is basically what i order everytime i go there, but overall the environment, service, attentiveness of staff were great. Price point is on par, i would definitely recommend this place for bunch of friends getting together or a casual date!"}
{"text":"Chicken way overpriced. Ribs were ok but again overpriced. Brisket was good. If you want better BBQ at a better price try Fat Louie's. I wouldn't go back here. Hipsters can't BBQ."}
{"text":"Foods great. If you get to eat any of it. They always sell out of the best things. Put a damn sign up if you don't have certain dishes(when you don't have a big menu to start with) the whole reason I wanted to eat here was for certain dishes and after I waited for 2 hours and finally sat down, there was no fried chicken, pork ends,or pork rinds. This is the second time I've come and it's been more of a letdown and a hastle then a good experience.  Be prepared to wait hours to get a crammed seat on a pic nic table for some food that you probably won't even get to eat. Waste of time."}
{"text":"The music is just as loud as the pair behind Grand Electric (Colin Tooke and Ian McGrenaghan) open up sister restaurant Electric Mud.  Replace tacos with BBQ goodness and you have their newest addition to the Parkdale dining scene.   The cocktail list is regrettably short, but true to GE style - Bourbon heavy.  The décor is hunting lodge meets 80's and 90's pin up, meets retro American diner.  The main menu is listed on a backlit sign but additional offerings are listed on a sheet of paper at the table.  I couldn't help but wonder if the more elaborate the sketches, the better the dish?    The food, like the music is loud and hard to ignore.  While the underlying cuisine is barbecue - they kick it up  a notch with menu items such as Crispy Pig Ears Salad ($10.50) which is served with an egg, on a bed of Romaine lettuce and buttermilk vinaigrette.  The pig ears, with its sweet, savory and crunchiness makes an otherwise too-sweet buttermilk dressing, forgiveable.  While Jessica Simpson may think that Buffalo wings refer to cows that fly, the kitchen has taken a BBQ staple and revamped it by replacing chicken with pig tails ($12.50).  The pork belly apocalypse that we've all been waiting for may now come to pass, as the Messiah that is full-flavoured, fatty pig's tail have arriveth.  And the smoked blue cheese dip that comes with might just steal the wings off Philly cream cheese for its creaminess.  While the menu is pork-centric, the Duck Ham ($13.50) doesn't pale in comparison.  Interlaced with thin chicken cracklings atop a bed of Hoisin sauce - this is the stuff that Big Green Eggs are famed for - smoky, smoky goodness.    And if you've got room, pass on the soft serve and go straight for the Banana Cream Pie ($5).  Served in a mason jar, the absence of banana custard is not missed because the Bourbon-flambéed bananas pack in much more intense banana flavor.  Coupled with a Graham cracker crust and a generous topping of whipped cream - I was thoroughly satisfied.  While pig ears and tails aren't for everyone - fear not as the standard ribs and fried chicken are still option on the menu.    The only question I have left is - who is responsible for the genocide of potatoes at this BBQ joint?  That's right, there are no fries on the menu."}
{"text":"Small place. Big taste.  Although the restaurant is on the smaller side, the menu packs a punch. Their crack rolls are extremely addictive, and go along amazingly with their pork ribs. Highly recommend trying their roasted corn too. Definitely worth the trip out to Parkdale.  Bless BBQ."}
{"text":"I wanted to bring my mother here, is how good this food is. My question being \"who wastes their appetite on bread anymore?\" - completely acceptable here. Cowboy ribs and brisket sandwich were amazing. Fried chicken and grits were really good but quickly shadowed by the \"cow\" food group.   I came here on a monday to bring the person who bore me to a very loud, non middle aged friendly restaurant and they were closed without warning? Wasn't a holiday, was after 6pm, checked online and yelp : open. This ticked me off especially since their voicemail wasn't changed to signal a closing for the day.  I understand the casual nature of this place, but thats disrespectful and disregarding the convenience of its guests. There were a couple groups of other confused people outside as well. NOT COOL ELECTRIC MUD.  Regardless, i will be crawling back for ribs and they will HOPEFULLY be open."}
{"text":"Electric Mud BBQ serves Southern-inspired barbecue. It reminds me of Freddy's BBQ Joint from the House of Cards. The atmosphere can only be described as cosy.  You may end up serving the table with fellow patrons. The tables are not incredibly comfortable. The service is efficient.    The items served at Electric Mud are likely high in calories so you should not come if you are on a diet. The following are a few of my favourites:   (1) The pork ribs are good. They're juicy, sticky, tender and smoky.  (2) The fried chicken comes moist and seasoned with chili and pepper - it's a refreshing departure from the sweeter, more common buttermilk kind.   (3) The coleslaw is delicious.   Electric Mud is a throw back to simpler times. If you like comfort food served in a greasy joint, then Electric Mud may be the place for you."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, would definitely go back. My table was big enough that we could order a little bit of everything, and I can say that pretty much everything was awesome. The standouts were the crack rolls (honestly the best rolls I've ever had), the beef brisket sandwich, and the fried chicken. Also loved the Big Boi Rootbeer - who would've thought root beer syrup and lager would taste so good together?  After reading the reviews, I was a little worried about the service being subpar and having a massive wait, but our servers were friendly and the food service was quick. Didn't have to wait too long for a table, either. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming experience. In a city full of great barbeque places that put a lot of care into their smokey meats, this place just ain't playing that hard.  The ribs were clearly boiled and finished on the grill which is not traditional but forgivable if the flavour was there, however it was not.  I want this place to step up their game. Develop one or two items that are going to make me wish I could return for time and time again. It's a great location, the service is decent, atmosphere, beer selection was all good. I just need something to make me not want to be at another BBQ joint.  This place is on my radar but I'll be hesitant to return."}
{"text":"Finger smacking delicious! I love places that specialize in a few things rather than taking on the world, and Electric Mud does just that and if you like pig, bbq and meat, it's totally worth a visit.   Despite the long wait, they do offer to call you after you put your name down. With good company, time passes quickly as we grabbed a drink at Cosmos down the street (towards Dufferin).   When we came back 45 mins later, they only had a bar table for us, but it was completely fine - they also have hooks for your purse/jacket under the counter.   The place is small. Filled with picnic tables for larger groups and possibly a communal setting. Upstairs are the washrooms and ATMs (cash only here) doused with a red light.   The food menu is small. Just a few staple items like ribs, pork belly and duck ham - ($12-15) and sides like potatoes, something called crack rolls (but was described to me as just butter and bread), collard greens, coleslaw etc ($3.50) and dessert - soft served ice cream with oreo cookie  bottom (Mud Pie) and a banana cream pie (around $5 each).   The two of us got the pork belly and full size ribs to share. Although it looked small on the plate, it was incredibly filling and tasty. Ribs, you get 4 full sized pieces with their special spicy peanuty mariande, leaving your hands sticky and smelling like smokey bacon. (need wet naps). The pork Belly was decadent, and fatty. mmmm fatty. comes with toast.  My suggestion for sides is to get something that will complement all the fattyness that you'll be eating, and the coleslaw was a perfect tangyiness and had the acidity that I think helped with digestion.   I wasn't too impressed with the $5 Mud Pie, but I think the banana cream pie has got rave reviews.   There is also a specials menu, which had fried chicken among other things. I didn't see cool things like pig ears and tails, maybe they took it off bc folks weren't adventurous enough?  Given that this is a sister restaurant of Grand Electric, that's my next go to place to try."}
{"text":"The pair behind Grand Electric have done it again.   My bf and I decided on a whim tonight that we would give the new Electric Mud a try.  Besides, we were on our way to the LCBO anyway :)  We got there around 6pm, just as they filled up. We had a 20 min wait, which was no problem to us. Note: they only take cash but have an ATM upstairs by the bathrooms.  EMB is a very small  place. If you've been to GE you are familiar with this. I'm going to try really hard not to do a comparison between EMB and GE here, but once you visit you'll understand the food similarities between the two.  The music is classic rock, nice and loud but not too loud that you can't talk. Snug like a bug we were seated at a table for two right up beside a picnic table of four.   I don't mind the tight spot personally;  just be very conscious of your personal space and don't try to bust out any ninja moves.  Hot sauce is the condiment on the table.  The walls are mostly chipboard and have random 'stuffed' fish hung around including vintage lit up beer signs and I think 80's poster girls. There's a deer on one wall too.  The decor reminds me of my dad's garage; random and cozy, a cool little spot you want to hang out in.     The BBQ menu is small and posted on the wall, easy to see. They have another paper menu with smaller portion BBQ items, beers and cocktails.  I'll break down tonight's order for you.  We ordered: - Ribs - Southern Fried Chicken - BBQ peanuts - Coleslaw - Hush puppies  The hush puppies and coleslaw ($3.50 each) came first. Both were really good. The slaw had sesame seeds which added an Asian flavour to it.  The hush puppies were served in a little dish sitting in a creamy sauce. Perfect for snacking on while you wait for your food.  Next came the ribs, chicken and BBQ peanuts.  The ribs reminded me very much of the ribs at GE (sorry! I really don't mean to compare).They were beautiful, delicious, juicy, meaty and perfectly seasoned.  There are three to an order for $13. My bf and I split the third one, but not willingly. Hands down my favourite menu item.   Next the chicken and BBQ peanuts. I'll comment on the peanuts last.  The fried chicken was THE juiciest chicken I have EVER had in my entire life.  It was piping hot, very crispy and very pleasing to the eye. Be VERY careful, the crust will fall off the juicy dripping chicken and you'll loose your drumstick. Ours slid out of our hands onto the table, which very well could have been the floor.  The chicken is served with HONEY.  Perfection. Dribble some hot sauce, dip it in the honey, take a bite and close your eyes. At $8.50 an order (4pc) you really can't go wrong.   The BBQ peanuts ($3.50) were a surprise. A spin on baked beans they are served in a bowl, saucy and soft.  Not what I was expecting at all.  I liked them but wouldn't order them again. I would have rather had smoked peanuts, toasted on the flat top to warm them up and sprinkled with a bbq salt of some sort. Not southern BBQ I know.. just saying that's what *I* would have preferred :)  The service was great, very attentive and friendly (just like GE). There were no individual eating plates brought to the table so we just ate over the dishes the food was served in. All in all we will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu (Catfish bun, Pork sandwich, pork belly, Crispy Pig Ear salad, Buffalo pig tails).  The patio in the summer time is going to be wicked awesome, a fun little spot to grab a beer and some sweet, sweet BBQ."}
{"text":"Great place in the summer. Relaxed patio. Good beer on tap. Laid back atmosphere and great food. Recommend the rib ends. Decently cheap too!"}
{"text":"BBQ cravings satisfied! After almost a month out of the country, I wanted nothing but good old comfort food to welcome me home.  We showed up on a Friday night and to our surprise, there was no wait for a table of 4. Though being seated by the door in the heated patio meant that whenever someone came in or left, a draft a cool air swept in. Our server came by and told us of their drink special for the night (hot apple cider, available with or without alcohol) and suggested we order family-style, which is what we did. Unfortunately they were out of the fried chicken.  We went with the BBQ Plate, which had a bit of everything, and an order of Hushpuppies, Rib Ends, and Mac & Cheese to accompany our feast. From the BBQ Plate, it was a toss-up between the chicken and the pork ribs as the favourite. Both were meaty and tender, and worthy of ordering again on a future visit. The beef brisket and smoked sausage were dry and disappointing, and the BBQ sauce on the table could not save them. As for the BBQ sauce, it is Carolina-style so it is a bit vinegary. Surprisingly, the potato salad and coleslaw that came with the platter were also stand-outs to me. It wasn't basic, ordinary potato salad drenched in mayo, and the coleslaw also wasn't drenched in mayo and had just the right amount of creaminess while still having a crunch to it.  As for our other dishes, the Hushpuppies was a nice start to our meal. The Mac & Cheese came piping hot, was smooth and creamy, and not overly saucy. And the Rib Ends were nicely smoked, and had just the right amount of BBQ sauce on it, and I think the overall favourite. We were all strongly considering ordering another round of them if we weren't too full!  Overall, a satisfying BBQ dinner and not a pricey meal when you order a number of dishes and eat them family-style. Some dishes stood out more than others and there were a few disappointments, but I'll know what to order next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place, but the BBQ doesn't compare to the other great BBQ places in Toronto (it's a tough fight). However, it's a spaced out from the other notable places, so I've gone here a couple times out of laziness. I do love the servers, the ambiance and the drinks. The BBQ isn't bad, but it's not amazing either. It is a small place though, so it can get really busy!"}
{"text":"These were the things I had at Electric Mud, and if I were two persons that shared the same consciousness, I could have taken on their whole menu. I love the vibe in the restaurant that aims to mimic the southern dingy grime of a bbq shack: the loud soulful music, the shoulder-to-shoulder seating, and the $4 bourbon shots!  We had their smoked chicken bbq, biscuits with meat dripping butter, and Ribs. These were all delicious and you don't need some trouble maker from out of town eloquently describing the taste. It was all succulent as F&*K."}
{"text":"Yummy hipster bbq spot w a chill patio out front and diner style seating inside.  Low key decor, chill soundtrack, friendly service, great menu and execution, plenty of old south bourbon and gin drinks.  We tried the crack rolls, coleslaw, Mac and cheese, beef brisket, and pork ribs on two separate occasions.  The first time, beef brisket was excellent; the second time, it was a bit dry.  In general though, everything I've had at Electric Mud was excellent including a drink called the Clydesdale!  Feels almost like the South except that the sweet tea is missing!"}
{"text":"So fkn good! I ordered the brisket and it was melt in your mouth delicious. An unexpected delight."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent food.  It is a little pricey but it's a great spot to enjoy with friends.  It is always busy but it is worth the wait.  Fried Chicken & Porch Crawler are my faves :)  Bring cash, they do not accept debit or credit cards."}
{"text":"Yelp did not disappoint, this place was pretty great. We ended up doing take-out, as it was very crowded on a Saturday night and we had a number of orders to put in.   Food: We ordered a mess of BBQ Pork Sandwiches, a side of potato salad, coleslaw, and a pork rind appetizer.. all of it was really good, and was ready for us to take quickly, even with the huge weekend crowd. Protip: There is a Beer Store next door that we spent our time in while getting the food.. by the time we got our beverages the food was ready.  Service: The host (I think, anyways) helped us out ordering and making sure we were settled up fast; all the servers seemed genuinely happy and greeted all of us while we were waiting.  Additional Thoughts: This is a cool place, very quirky and trendy feeling, just like many places in this neighborhood. Loved the bizarre graffiti and fascination with crosses that adorn the building."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was good. Place was dirty, but overall good service, good food and good bar"}
{"text":"I would give Electric Mud a 3.5; The food was delicious, the atmosphere was inviting but the service is what made me retract a star.   Electric Mud is a great addition to the Parkdale neighbourhood. I went with two of my girl friends on a Friday night in September when the weather was still nice. Naturally the patio was packed. We were told the wait for the three of us at 7 p.m. would be around 45 minutes (it was actually an hour) so we decided to go around the corner and have a drink at a bar beforehand. Advice: go early or late - or be prepared to wait.  We got sat outside on the patio around 8 p.m. The patio has cute wooden benches and lights all around it - providing a cozy, hip atmosphere. The drinks weren't overly expensive which was refreshing. Great selection of booze.   My friend ordered the crack rolls as an appetizer, which honestly I wouldn't recommend. There wasn't anything special about them, they were basically just bread and butter. The rest of the food was great. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and Fried Chicken plate. Both were amazing. The mac and cheese had the perfect amount of cheese and richness without being overbearing. The fried chicken had a chilli spice to them but the gravy counteracted the spice a little bit. The pieces were big and juicy (just how I like 'em).  The food and drinks came fast, which can be rare in Toronto. The service started off good - our waiter was extremely friendly at the beginning. Toward the end you could tell he was prompting us to order more things so he could get a bigger tip (even though we each already ordered several drinks and food). When we asked for the bill, he put it all on one even though we asked for three separate checks. He told us they didn't separate the checks at Electric Mud. I've never been to a restaurant before where they didn't separate checks...I've also worked at several restaurants. That was clearly his own laziness.   We started trying to divide up what each of us ordered when our server made a point to come back and say \"the total doesn't include the tip by the way.\" I have 5 years experience working as a server and my other friend also worked as a waitress (pretty sure we told him this earlier). The entire night we never gave any inclination we weren't going to tip, so I'm not sure why that comment was necessary.   Our server left a sour taste in my mouth, but I would give Electric Mud a second chance because the food was great. Hopefully next time it's a different server."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ spot in all of Toronto. I'm from Brooklyn NYC and it's the place I always visit for a meal. The service is amazing the atmosphere is authentic, ouuu... that fried chicken tho . The drinks are refreshing not to take away from everything else ask for the watermelon  lemonade."}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken and it travels well if you order out.  Tasty fresh always cooked perfectly and the sauces are ok.  The gravy is nice and the hot sauce is not great.  For those that love sauce this sauce tastes like franks with extra vinegar.  I would expect them to create a better hot sauce.  The potato salad has nice flavour with some crunch texture (chips), the last time I had it was under seasoned but usually it is spot on.  Big fan of the coleslaw as well."}
{"text":"Came here after work in search of trying a new restaurant in the Parkdale area. Made a reservation earlier in the day and chose outdoor seating, it was nice to sit outside.  We were seated effortlessly when we got there, the picnic tables are a bit difficult to get in and out which was a bit awkward. Because the table we had was shared with another couple and we didn't want to kick the other person getting in and out.   We loved that they gave us a jug of water and all of our utensils / paper towels were all ready on the table for us - we didn't have to ask the staff for anything. Ordered a regular Caesar with vodka. ($12) a bit pricey only because it didn't include anything extra/special about it, no garnishes except for the celery salt on the rim. We ordered Fried Chicken ($13)-was totally worth it, very good and flavorful. Next we got our BBQ Platter ($35) included: 2 smoked wings, beef brisket, pulled pork, 3 ribs, coleslaw, potato salad, and bread. No it did not include fries which we had to order on the side ($4).  Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner here and would definitely come back again. I prefer this over Grand Electric Tacos (the music is extremely loud and way too overcrowded for the space). For the price there could be more included like a small amount of fries for the platters. The wait for a table can be a long time if you are a walk in."}
{"text":"I like this place, I really really like this place. There are three reasons why:  1. It's consistent. The dishes taste the same every time I eat there. I never order the fried chicken and wonder: will it be soggy tonight? I never order the crack rolls and wonder, will these buns be dry? No, the fried chicken is crispy and the crack rolls are sinfully warm and buttery.  2. It's cheap. I ate here last week, paid $40 - but I ate like a KING. Rolls, appetizer, 2 mains, side dishes, 2 boozy drinks each and dessert. I was full, tipsy and still had $20 in my wallet. If that's not cheap enough for you, go Monday when they have an ungodly beer special (1$?2$?)  3. Good vibe. Servers are really friendly, the vibe is really laid back, they play amazing music and you never really have to wait that long in line.   God I love this place.  My must orders 1. Crack rolls: see above. They had me at flavoured butter. 2. Tuna appetizer: perfectly light and savoury right before all the fried sauced shit you're about to eat 3. Beef rib: the pork ribs are good, really good. But the beef rib is massive and soft. 4. Fried chicken. So fried. And the sauce, oh the sauce 5. Potato salad & coleslaw. Potato salad has hickory sticks in them which remind me of my childhood in the best way possible. Coleslaw. Damn. I didn't know coleslaw could taste so good.  6. Banana cream pie. I don't even LIKE bananas and I fight my boyfriend over this dish."}
{"text":"Only updating this review to add mention of their Pulled Pork Sandwich. I've been getting take out from this place more regularly (fried chicken and sides all stand the test of time) and now want to include the Pulled Pork Sandwich within my top 10 list.  The sandwich is served on what looks to be Wonder bread buns. It's also not very big in size compared to a lot of other pulled pork sandwiches in in the city, but the smokey flavour of the meat, the nice applied bbq sauce, the complimentary coleslaw nestled between the bun and meat... It's rather glorious. And at $8 on its own, isn't a bad deal. Even better when washed down with a side of potato salad. Or fried chicken if feeling especially gluttonous."}
{"text":". The smells that come out of here is what made me want to step in. The only thing was that it opens at 5 and it gets busy really fast so try to get there right when they open. I ordered the fried chicken and coleslaw and my boyfriend ordered the same thing with fries so I got to try those too :). Now the chicken is actually surprisingly really good. To be honest when I think of fried chicken I get a little grossed out, but this was really good. The coleslaw was also good  and the fries were average. I'd go again just for the chicken"}
{"text":"Very very good food.  Love everything about this place.  Simple menu, delicious food, nice people.  I will definitely go back and I will definitely recommend this to everybody."}
{"text":"Good BBQ but portions aren't very generous for what you are paying. I think one is mostly paying for the [hot and sweaty] backyard-like BBQ ambiance and hipster service (which was actually quite friendly here!) that comes at popular Parkdale restaurants. Not to mention standing in line upon open. Good but I'll keep on looking."}
{"text":"I went last Friday and had a great time. Got there at 6pm and had to wait for 30mins. We didn't mind since we were first in line and could have some appies at the bar near the kitchen and some cold ones. Atmosphere is loud and seating is tight but I really enjoyed it.  Rock music blasting, good comfort food, great friends is a good way to start the evening. Fried chicken and slaw is really good. Reasonable prices as well. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"The beef ribs that I had were juicy, tender and flavourful - just the right amount of heat from the seasoning. The ribs were also very filling. I also had the potato salad which were really good as well and helped to balance out my meal for the night. The only thing that I'm not very fond of is how cramped and tiny the restaurant is. It makes conversations awkward while you are sitting right next to strangers on picnic benches. Other than that, I'll be coming back here again to try out more foods from their menu!"}
{"text":"When you feel like you are alone or missing something in life. Come here. Eat some smoked pork. Enjoy the amazing staff and let go of your problems. I'll be here as often as I can. Thanks team electric."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and the waitress acted like we were a burden. The food was very mediocre. I had the pork ribs and there was barely any meat and the little meat that was on it was dry and gross. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"The side ribs were freaking delicious,  huge spicy kick to them. Shrimp grits are to die for. Cloverdale (I think that's what it's called) cocktail is nice. Great atmosphere and I can't wait to go back. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Was in the city for a night last Sunday and needed somewhere to eat. This place was a 10 min walk from the condo so we walked over. It was small....cozy. Unfortunately there was a private party on the deck so we couldn't sit there but it was cool.  We got the wings (It was wing night $1.50 per wing instead of $13. 99 for a pound.) and mac&cheese. It was really good. I wasn't a fan of the dry rub on the wings at first but adding a bit of the sauce it came with really balanced out the taste. The mac&cheese was good too. Great wait staff...really casual. Reasonable prices. I'll go again when I'm in the city."}
{"text":"I went here with two friends a month ago and we tried a number of things.  My favorites were probably the rib ends and the Cowboy Beef Rib--the latter I liked so much that I ordered another one after both my friends said they were full.  It was moist, flavorful, and not too lean!  For dessert, we had a sweet potato pudding, which sounded good enough to suffer a bit of sugar.  It had crumbled Oreo on the bottom, and torched marshmallow on top--pretty awesome actually!  I'm not a huge BBQ fan for the most part, and this is the only BBQ place to which I've gone more than once.  If they had more comfortable seating, I might give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came into this place with high hopes with my mom. We were in town from Chicago for Memorial Day weekend. We got seated at a table with some other people which was no problem. As soon as we sat down, the girl looks at us ( we are both African American) and says \"Just so you know we are all out of fried kitchen\". Of course, the table ( drunk before we arrived ) starts laughing with the waitress. So my mom and I left. FYI, we were there for BBQ actually, not \"Fried Chicken\". I'm glad everyone had a laugh. Avoid this place if you are of color."}
{"text":"I arrived with 4 friends here on a rainy Saturday night, waited around 10 minutes for seats which isn't bad for a place so small. one of the servers offered us a menu to see what we'd like to order when we were seated and asked if we wanted to order some drinks while we waited. we all had the pumpkin ale which was alright. when we sat down we ordered the fried chicken, ribs, brisket sandwich, fried green tomatoes and the cracks rolls. I had the brisket sandwich which was amazing, the fried chicken was also good served with a KFC style gravy, and the ribs were good too but a bit spicy. the fried green tomatoes also came with fried jalapeños which made it rather spicy too. the cracks rolls in my opinion are overrated and overpriced, they were good but not amazing and not worth it, in the end they are just bread/dinner rolls, I'd rather have red lobster biscuits."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. That is the most important thing to remember. You're probably not going to get warm and fuzzy service. The music is loud. (Though it's hand selected records by the staff spun on a real record player) The place is small and crowded. But the BBQ is some of the best I've ever had and that's all the matters.   My partner and I sat at the bar and ate: - ribs - fried chicken - collard greens - grilled corn in the cob   The ribs were smoky and delicious. The fried chicken was crispy and moist. The corn on the cob was sweet and had a delicious butter on top.  I can't rave enough about the food. Even in a city full of great food, we will most definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken i've had,,, comes with amazing sauce,,, Beef Brisket was great too.. would have given this place 5 stars but the portions are pretty small... Another thing this place can get pretty busy so expect a wait time."}
{"text":"Picnic tables and ZZ Top playing on a turntable - this place starts out looking and sounding like the most authentic southern rib joint in TO and then: surprise!  A look at the menu reveals that this ain't your usual rib joint. First, there are not a lot of ribs on the menu. Backs, sides, beef, and tips are the only rib offerings. And the other stuff: broccoli, cauliflower, green and yellow beans- whaaatttt?  We started off with the Charred Green and Yellow Beans sprinkled with fresh basil and a serious aioli. I was thinking that this dish could be served on white linens by a guy in a tux with classical music in the background and it would still work. Not your usual rib joint.   The Buffalo Cauliflower tastes just like sauced buffalo wings, drizzled with a Blue Cheese dressing. Probably the lowest calorie item on the menu!  We had the Rib Tips and the Beef Ribs.  The Beef Ribs come 2 on a plate for $16, a bit pricey compared to a rack of ribs for the same price.  Overall, the meat dishes were tasty, but the portions are not as generous as they could be.  The only real problem I had is that Electric Mud is focussed on Carolina BBQ, which is more vinegar based than brown sugar and molasses sauce.  The desert choice was the Buttermilk Pie, which is a subtly sweet custard on a crisp crust with a sour cream whipped cream on top. Probably one of the nicest pies I have had in a long time.  Prices are relatively high.  $30 per person will not fill you up quite as much as $20 at another rib place.  But the service is excellent, the staff knowledgable, and the ambiance is fun.  The food is very unique, and could easily pass in an upscale dining room."}
{"text":"Finally made my way out to the west side to check out this BBQ place.  I love everything about this place from the small compact space to the open kitchen where you can watch your meal be made from the bar.  we got the pork ribs, rib ends, fried chicken, crack rolls, and the hushpuppies.  It was a pretty massive meal but well worth it everything tasted amazing and the sauces that come with them were perfect choices.  Only reason why this place doesn't get a 5 is because i have peanut allergies and the pork ribs recipe can't be changed....oh well not a biggie because everything esle was wicked."}
{"text":"Great Location, Great atmosphere....is the hype worth it....maybe to go to once.  This will not become a regular spot for me but it was a fun experience nevertheless.  Drinks were lovely, food was so/so.  Portions are small for the price and lacks in flavour....luckily that had an incredible bbq sauce on the table that we ended up smothering everything in. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I am a bit surprised reading a lot of the rave reviews on this site... my experience at Electric Mud was definitely lacklustre.  I had been wanting to check it out for a long time and we arrived early so the wait time wasn't an issue.  I expected the food to be outstanding, whereas it was completely mediocre - was it what we ordered?  The buffalo cauliflower was way overbattered and not exactly what I'd call a brilliant flavour combination, but probably the best thing we got.  The potato salad was not any tastier than, say, what you'd make at home or get at Swiss Chalet.  And most disappointing, the ribs! - this should have been the crowning glory of our meal but instead the ribs were fairly dry with too little sauce.  We chewed our way through some of them and took the rest home to fix up and re-sauce the next day for lunch.  It seemed like a mistake, at a place like this where the whole raison d'etre is fantastic barbeque.  I really did want to like this place but can't imagine why it's so popular, especially with waitstaff who remind you a few times that they may have to cram strangers onto your spacious table, when the entire patio around you is dead empty, and with a weeknight special of bourbon shots that you're not allowed to put any coke or mixers into... just shoot it straight, ma'am, or you don't get the deal.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on a whim on Sunday wing night. This place was amazing. Wings were crispy even with the sauce. The charred broccoli was delicious. There are so many other things we would have loved to try like the chicken sandwich and fried cauliflower."}
{"text":"Been here many times over the years and it's generally pretty good. Sometimes inconsistent though. Came here recently to get the buttermilk pie to go and they tacked on a take out charge? Also it wasn't very good this time. I love the patio though and I come here when I want some variety in my bbq - they have lots of interesting little things."}
{"text":"The service was nice, the people work there were really friendly. However, the food quality was a bit off tonight. We ordered the ribs, shrimp and beef brisket bun.. Both me and my friend think the BBQ sauce on the ribs were a but too strong, and the shrimp were too salty.. Also I think the shrimp wasn't worth the price.. The dish was $19.99 and only had 5 shrimps in it"}
{"text":"Standard BBQ fare overall - the pork ribs were tasty, rib ends had an interesting Asian flavour and reminded me of sweet and sour pork. I didn't love the chicken wings or fried chicken mainly because I feel like I've had much better in other establishments (Korean fried chicken is the best). The coleslaw could have been a bit more acidic, the fried beans, french fries, and cauliflower were fine.   The only truly standout and memorable dish was the hushpuppies - I loved those!!! The other reason to go here is the lovely patio which is comprised of several large picnic tables. They also have Jelly King beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Hipsters, hipsters, they're everywhere!  One Saturday night a buddy invites me for supper and wants to try the Electric Mud. He hears from someplace somewhere that this is supposed to be the best BBQ in Toronto.  \"Where did you say you want to go? Electric what? WTFBBQ?\" \"Yeah, it's in Parkdale\" \"Oh. Okay. Whatever.\"  Upon arrival, we find ourselves in a very cramped and dark divey garage room, with its beaten up grimy floor and its particleboard walls covered in all sorts of beer signs and stuff. It feels like a hipster version of those roadside biker dive bars you see in movies, albeit with loud blues music being beaten out of a skipping record player running behind the bar. But you can barely move an inch without bumping into a rushing server while hoping one of these picnic tables clear out soon enough and contemplating the place's obvious links to that other Parkdale hipster institution Grand Electric.  What they said was a 30 minute wait turned out to be closer to an hour, but at least they'll telephone you when they are ready for you. Then we raided the menu, ordering such things like their $14 pork ribs, which only came in a small-sized handful (like, four pieces) and was lean in protein content and taste. The brisket sandwich ($6.50) wasn't so much a micro-sandwich as it was a pile of succulent fried onions burying a pile of thinly cut and bland \"Montreal style\" deli brisket. On a half-foot-squared portion, it was practically half a meal.  Small portions, no reservations, cash only. Oh well; typical. There's an ATM and washroom upstairs.   The cute bartender saw us sampling all the hot sauces they had out while waiting for our grub and insists they had one much hotter than all of these, but her search came empty handed. As I sampled one of their house sauce-- a tangy and kinda sweet concoction called \"Twerk and Jerk\"--I saw the label notes it is proudly made \"beside the Parkdale LCBO.\"  Ah yes the Electric Mud is indeed beside an LCBO, where we bought and finished bottles of Steam Whistle to pass the time while waiting for a seat. Where we watched a couple make out beside our car. Where you are greeted coming in and out by a bum who promise to spend the money you give him on beautiful hookers. It is the most hipster liquor store in all of Toronto.   On a sobering thought about the food overall back at the Mud, I must say I tasted better stuff drinking straight out of a bottle of supermarket BBQ sauce. It was finger-licking good, just not finger-licking great. Where's the mindblowing flavours!? The Electric Mud purport itself on serving American South styled barbecue, and if this is the best we can do in Toronto, then I might as well cry my way back to the American Confederacy. So what if American South barbeque is somehow now a latest Toronto foodie trend; serving working class food at hipster prices and portions, Electric Mud BBQ sure ain't no ribfest.  \"If you can kill it, we can grill it,\" reads the bottom of their menu. Yeah, we'll see about that (*holds a squirrel roadkill found across the street*). But hey, $2 pints on Mondays. Too bad I live in the eastside, yo.  {TTC: take the 501 streetcar to Brock Ave. Then channel your inner Daryl Dixon (assuming you watch too much Walking Dead) and prepare to fight your way through a crowd of drunk hipster zombies for the next 100 metres. Declare \"CLAIMED\" upon securing a seat.}"}
{"text":"Great meal tonight. Sat outside to avoid near deafening music (in case I wanted to actually hear the convo of the other 3 peeps I went out with tonight, so as to not mess with MY vibe of the evening).    Ordered ribs (tasty, grease running down to my elbows (no joke), fried chicken -- divine.  Collard greens, crack buns, baked beans, coleslaw, banana cream pie and mud pie.    Best thing on the menu:  The Clydesdale.  An alcoholic beverage that this non-alcoholic girl had 2 of cause it was out of this world, so super easy to drink tasty, smooth, total yum yum.    This place only takes CASH!  So hit your ATM before you get here.  For the 4 of us, we spent $90/couple.  Very reasonable, all in, taxes, tip, and quite a few drinks (hiccup!)"}
{"text":"The smell when you walk in is wonderful!  Crowded, with some community seating, it's a very cozy space with lots of conversations swirling around. Very rustic décor, meant to look like a restaurant has been there for 40 years.  We wanted a beer and snack - so we ordered some wings and rib ends. The fussy eater was with us, so we let her pick the sauces.  When the wings came I was a bit wary - they were very naked!  No coating.   However they tasted great. The particular sauce we had was very salty, so I would try something else next time.  The rib ends were tasty - but we were getting pretty full. Asked for a box and took them home.  They were just as good the next day. :-)  Would I return: Yes Would I recommend: Yes"}
{"text":"Other than the amazing patio, this place was a disappointment. Service was slow and the ribs were still pink, undercooked and very greasy. Overall,  the food was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Loved it here!  The place is pretty hipster - they have a retro record player spinning at the bar.  The food was amazing! We ordered the calamari, fried chicken, crack rolls and their pork side ribs. Everything we ordered was delicious. I really enjoyed the batter for the calamari, I'd definitely recommend this!  The environment was great, service was okay. The hostess has a generic answer for how long the wait is - usually 30 minute. But it took about 10-15 for us to get a table, not bad :)"}
{"text":"Just in love - I'll go here any chance I get (which is many, being a 30 second walk from my place). My favourite drink here is the Clydsdale - cannot get over how delicious it is, and perfectly crafted! A real cocktail. As for the food, you can't go wrong with anything here. They recently took the peanuts off their ribs, but they're just as delicious (if not more - may have tweaked the sauce a bit since my last time). The butter that goes on the crack rolls is what's truly additctive! And for the best value - the brisket. Big log of a meat sandwich, it's definitely a meal for the $6.50 price. Dessert is usually fantastic - I'll always get whatever is in a jar that day! Last time was banana cream :)  In the winter their outdoor patio is sheltered and heated, so seating isn't an issue!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The crack rolls are incredible, the fried chicken delicious. Very smoky inside!"}
{"text":"So last night I tried to go to a well known taco place around the corner.  35 minute wait! I was meeting a friend so I waited for a bit. Then my friend called me because she had gone to the wrong place, but had seats! That wrong place was Electric Mud BBQ. Never have I been happier about a mix up. I had the fried chicken and it was insane... Insanely good! Also Manhattans were the drink special,  and now I can't stop drinking those! Thanks for ruining my diet!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for some time. So glad I finally got to try it.  My friends and I came here on Friday around 7:00pm. We were lucky because we didn't have to wait for a table. It's pretty crammed inside and out so try to not bring too many things with you.  Our server was very knowledgable about the menu. He convinced me to get their smoked chicken special. This option is not always available on their menu. Can't remember when the server said they have this.    The order:   The big boi rootbeer as per my server's recommendation. It was sweet and good. Beer with rootbeer syrup. I liked it!  Crack Rolls - soooooo good! The butter is smoked and sweet. I could eat the butter all on its own!   Spicy Pickled Green Tomatoes - very unique. I've never had pickled green tomatoes before. They were sweet and sour, very flavourful! Would go perfect in a sandwich!  Served in a mason jar. So cute.   Albacore Tuna Poke - pretty delicious. Huge chunks of ceviche tuna with homemade corn.    Smoked chicken legs - very tender and full of flavour. I'm not really a fan of smoked meat, but this was my fave main. Dare I say, better than the famous fried chicken, in my opinion.   Fried Chicken - I know Electric mud is known for this. It was good. I liked the gravy sauce they used. The chicken was very tender and crispy. I do have to put it out there that in my opinion, I think white brick kitchen's  fried chicken is probably better than electric mud. While the seasoning is different and both are super tender and crispy, my heart is still with white brick for their fried chicken.  Damage was $30 each including tax and tip. Very reasonable. Would definitely come back!   You can pay with credit card."}
{"text":"Very good for dry rub barbeque. Definitely recommend the BBQ plate to try everything. For vegetarian baconless mac and cheese or buffalo cauliflower were delicious and filling. No free refills on sodas  and very limited seating. Use open seat reservation"}
{"text":"This is my top comfort food spot in the city. Cute little place a little off the beaten track with mouth watering fried chicken and house made milk buns paired with a smoked butter that will bring you to pleasure filled tears. I've spent many a special event gorging myself silly at this establishment and I always order more than I can eat ... because the fried chicken in particular makes the BEST leftovers. I just celebrated my engagement there a week ago and I already can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, and the BBQ is always yummy and so is their fried chicken. Digging their smoked wings, and my friend loved it. Make sure to get here early, as they will fill up. We had the drink special on Thursday with $4 Buffalo Trace... yummy"}
{"text":"Not as good as I thought it would be. Portions too small. The beef rib was literally only bones. I have been to better barbeque places."}
{"text":"The red-headed stepchild of Grand Electric, Electric Mud is a foray into BBQ.  Don't bring any southerners here, because it's not entirely successful.  I might even be a bit generous with 3 stars.    The FOOD:  The crack rolls are pretty good as everyone says, but not all that imaginative.  I was pretty disappointed with their ribs.  This is not in competition with any of the good BBQ joints I've been to (E&J in Oakland, Slows in Detroit), etc.  The ribs were a little dry and the sauce was overwhelmingly bland.  The fried chicken was better, although a rather small portion.  The level of mastery here is nowhere near the level of mastery of Grand Electric.  2.5 stars  The DRINKS:  They have a smallish cocktail list, an unimpressive bottle list, and a couple beers on draft.  Depending on the beer it's ok, but the cocktails I find were not thought out for a BBQ joint.  2.5 stars.  The SERVICE:  Friendly enough, nothing special.  The VIBE:  It's a rustic sort of vibe.  Reminds me of a shack.  At least it's not as loud as it's sister restaurant...I can hear my friends I'm eating with.  Overall, I'm going to use the O-word:  Over-hyped.  The affiliation with Grand Electric, really gets this place business, but until they step up their game, I'm not in a rush to come back...at least it's not too expensive."}
{"text":"This restaurant has such character and charm. The drinks are delicious, the food was cooked well and it's a wonderful place to gather with friends. I ordered the fried chicken which had crispy skin, light gravy and juicy chicken inside. I also a order a portion of pork ribs. I prefer my ribs cooked until they are fall off the bone tender however the meat was still very firm and they needed a bit more sauce for my taste. However, they had many options for ribs whether you prefer beef, pork or pork ends. Their coleslaw and crackle were delicious. Their portions are small and should be shared. Will be back for the drinks and the  atmosphere! Their granny. K cider is delicious - it's cider with a hint of bourbon. They also take reservations which also makes this place great for birthdays!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised at the low reviews here. I came here by myself Friday night and got seated at the bar right away. I was in Nashville the previous week and the hot chicken I got Hattie B's didn't fully hit the spot. I ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich here and Electric Mud did it right. The skin was thick and crispy, the chicken inside was juicy and full of flavor and it carried some kick. It is a bit pricy ($16) but I thought it tasted better than the fried chicken I had the previous week in Nashville."}
{"text":"Found this place on Enroute magazine Top 10 restaurants in Canada 2013-so intrigued to try this BBQ place out. Finally went on a Sunday night-8:30, no line up. A bit surprise by the decor, BBQ tables filled with hipsters(not so surprising, I'm in Parkdale!), but atmosphere was kinda fun. But when our server told me there's no fried chicken tonight-I was extremely disappointed!  I heard so much good things about it. Anyways, we ordered the pork ribs, shrimps & grits, ox tongue, cauliflower, pork neck-all very flavourful and juicy. The presentation for pork ribs and shrimps & grits were delightful. Overall-tasty food, yummy and finger-licking (it's bbq after all), and meat were still tender and juicy inside.  Ordered their desserts-they were divine!  Must have.   Again, might not be the best romantic restaurant u want to take your date-so finish the food and get out."}
{"text":"I love the flavours they produce. Yes, it's always busy and I always arrive early. Yes, they only take cash, big deal! Their rib ends are to die for; they have this hint of spicy beauty that makes you pause. I've had every \"on-the-bun\" section and amazing! I always get their oysters because they're done to perfection even when you're wishing the oyster was bigger. I would also sell my soul for the banana cream pie. I'm there at least twice a month just for the food."}
{"text":"I'm sure this could have been a 4 star. short wait on a summery Friday night early dinner around 7:30. friendly hostess and servers. Food was good, I think I expected more with the pork ribs. Flavour was there but not as tender I thought it would be. Better try something else next time to give it a second chance.  broccoli salad - yum! Corn - my friends were really enjoying that. Fried chicken - super crispy batter and well-cooked chicken.   I love my Caesars so this one totally failed me. Too much spice and salt. Spicy enough but too salty. Alcohol is there, just not a good mix. I don't know why it came with a wedge of lime and lemon! I'm good with just he celery stick.   I'll come back, just different ribs and no Caesar. Maybe 4 stars next time!"}
{"text":"Came through early eve and had no wait. Delicious drinks served up quick by friendly staff in a no stress, diner environment with a patio for pre-and-post bbq sun drenched drinking pushes me towards 5 stars already. Because what can I say, I'm easy. I loved the Clydesdale and my girl had the sweet tea with bourbon and declared it her new favourite of everything.   But the rib ends. Can we talk? What is the magic of the crispiness and the fall-off-the-bone softness and the sauce the likes of which I have never quite encountered, sweet and spicy and layered and swoon? Everything else was good too, but I sort of forgot about it after my rib ends + Clydesdale foodgasm."}
{"text":"I've tried quite a lot of BBQ from across the USA and this was unimpressive. Gotta say Barque Smokehouse on Roncesvalles is a far superior restaurant for quality of food & bang for your buck. Plus, it's not obnoxiously hipster like this place (REALLY. You'll understand if you ever go in, or even walk by).   First off, this place is cash only. My friend and I spent well over 100 bucks here. No one usually carries that type of money on them. We didn't even leave that full. They get away with saying their plates are meant to be shared (even though it no where on the menu says it should be treated this way). Expensive \"tapas\" places just piss me off.   We originally sat inside at the bar, but moved out to the patio so we could actually have table room. They had a record player right in the bar/kitchen area, where anyone sitting at the bar could spill a drink on it. That's how they play all their music. Alright, I get you're super hipster, but the placement of the deck seemed super illogical.   Here's what we ate:  Pork Rinds ($3.75): GET THIS. This is really the only reason I gave Electric Mud 2 stars. They were amazing. And the pimento cheese dip that came with it was drool worthy. Once all the pork rinds were done, I totally ate it with my fingers ha.   Grilled Pork Neck ($9): Nothing special. Not bad, but pretty rubbery.   Beef Tongue (??): I didn't particularly like this. It was served slightly seared, but mainly raw, like carpaccio style. On top was this over mayo'd, slaw like topper, with broccoli. All paired together in a fork full was okay, but I wouldn't order it again.   Bar-B-Que Pork on a Bun ($5): Since we were sharing everything else (since that's what the waiter said their dishes were meant for) we wanted to share this. It's 5 bucks for a HALF sandwich fyi. We asked them to cut the sandwich in half for us, but the kitchen refused. Seriously? Why can't you cut a sandwich in half? The waiter had to bring us a stake knife so we could do it ourselves. Was it because the dish must look a certain way encase, heaven forbid, another customer would see it in it's disgusting split state? Just strange. The bottom bun was soggy, which is always a turn off. It was fairly bland & way too creamy.   Pork Side Ribs ($14.50): Three super fatty, and full of inedible cartilage. Didn't look like it had much of a smoke ring. Bland, and the sauce they had availble on the side was either painfully hot, or weak sauce.   They did moderate prices on pitchers & certain days they have good deals on drinks. But this place would shame any legit BBQ place out there. It's no surprise that you rarely smell the smoker outside. Even for \"artsy\" bbq, this place fails horribly."}
{"text":"To be honest, their meats did not resonate well with my taste buds. It's a fun spot for large groups but I was not too impressed. Their meats weren't as succulent as I would have liked. It's definitely got a nice vibe though."}
{"text":"I'll try to be quick and simple. The food taste really good but the portions size  are ridiculous small, almost to the point to be a rip off. The atmosphere is cool because of the people and music but the place it self looks dirty. $16 Dll for three pieces of Ribs, what a joke!  The sandwiches are the best, specially the Beef Brisket but once again, is only half sandwich for $8 Dll, really small."}
{"text":"I really want to give this spot 5 stars but the floor plan is just not ideal especially if your seated right by the entrance. People are literally waiting in line right next to your table while you eat to see if they can get a spot without reservations..I just didn't find that appealing especially when the weather is cold because people in line keep the door open to see if they can get a table or not... so you are constantly exposed to a cold draft during evening hours. Aside from that, the service isnt 100. So if the dish is not to your liking they wont do anything about it...A few of my friends are regulars here and introduced me to this place and when we addressed the fact that one of the dishes was actually a bit burnt the server shrugged and did nothing about it and said thats how its prepared. When in fact that is not how its normally prepared since my friends go there all the time and have ordered the same dish multiple times and even they were surprised by the servers response and reaction. luckily for them, were not the type of people to give a hard time or to take situations like this serious enough to address it further...but it does effect their quality of service because some people are bit more of a tight ass and wont be satisfied with that type of response.   In regards to the food... Aahhmaazing. A few of my favorites that you must try:  Fried Chicken  Ribs  Rib Tips  Buffalo Cauliflower  Mac & Cheese  Crack Rolls  Broccoli salad  I didnt like the slaw (onions were very overpowering) and the pulled pork on a bun was meh, nothing special.  BTW their pink lemonade and Beergarita are really good.  I will definitely be back for more because they still have so much on the menu that i have not tried and the food really does speak for itself. I would love to give them a 5 star rating but in reality they have a few things that they need to work on in order to really be a 5 star dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue joint. The best fried chicken I've had in a long while. I feel like I always want to try something new here, and so far I haven't been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty interesting.  Not the expected BBQ style food.  Had the Rib Ends and they tasted like they were BBQed and then deep-fried and slathered in a tangy sweet bbq sauce.  The Crack Bread was good as it came with a smoky butter which was very interesting.  The fried chicken was moist, had a nice crunch, and boneless, but not the best fried chicken I have had.  The BBQ Pork Sandwich was small, but tasty.  The peanut butter pie was ok.  Very small place so always a line-up.  Overall, I would recommend checking it out, but don't expect traditional BBQ style food."}
{"text":"Get the Buffalo cauliflower!  You won't be disappointed. Unless you hate cauliflower. Then you are out of luck.  Amazing fried chicken too!"}
{"text":"Went to Electric Mud for the first time last Thursday for my brother's birthday. He's been telling me how great it was forever and I was always a big fan of Grand Electric so was very excited to try everything.  The food did not disappoint. They had a special on rib ends that night which were probably my favourite item but we also tried the crack rolls (awesome), hush puppies (very tasty), the brisket sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich (sandwiches were good). We also got the mac n cheese which was great too!  I tried one of their old fashioned cocktails which was fantastic. Probably the best old fashioned I've ever had.  Where the meal really took a downward spiral was the service. Without the service it was easily a 4 or 4.5 star experience but they really need to take a look at who they hire to deal with customers. After calculating several times (my brothers friend gave me $250 and I added another $85 plus another $40+20% or so tip on a card (so around $385 total on a $295ish bill the server rudely comes over and slams $7 on the table saying that is all you left for a tip. Confused my brothers friend was ready to leave another $50 until we asked them to check again. The bus boy comes back and says there seems to have been an issue on the POS system (Didn't she count the cash before entering it in??). The server then ignores our table and then finally after we flag her down says oh there was a mistake and we are free to go now. No apology or thanks for leaving a 25%ish tip. I can't believe how rude this person is and really wish we had only left $7 in hindsight, though even that would have been too much for her attitude.  Hopefully you have a better experience but I will not return for that attitude."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome joint! As soon as you walk in you notice that the place is small but cozy. The servers here were very attentive therefore we got attention right away.   For drinks I ordered Apple cider w/bourbon and let me tell you i have never drank apple cider and delicious and smooth as this one. My friend ordered a egg nog drink with rum. I tried it but i prefered mine better. We were told that mostly the entrees here are meant to shared, although when i saw the portions i thought otherwise. I just ended up getting a BBQ pulled pork sandwich with a side of potato salad. My friend got a fried calamari sandwich. My sandwich was soo good, the sandwich was stuffed with juicy bbq pulled pork. And the potato salad was tasty but small. Oh and for dessert we got a maple corn bread with caramel and vanilla ice cream on top. Omg too good! Everything here was really down right delicious, however the portions are small for the prices. I wouldnt come here to get stuffed but the deliciousness of everything here might just make up for it."}
{"text":"So it was my first time here, I just happen to be apt sitting near by and a gf stopped by so we decided to do dinner..  So as we stepped out it happen to be right across the street so it was convenient for us .. I had walked by earlier in the afternoon and it was jammed packed so I thought to myself why not?   We sat out on the patio, nice atmosphere.. Sever was über friendly and pretty much explained any questions we had about the menu (which was pretty much everything).. Menu was simple enough which I loved..   My gf had their pork belly with a side of fried green tomatoes and I had fried chicken with a side of collard greens..  Food didnt take too long to come out, everything was great, loved the fact that their fried food items weren't greasy.. I also loved the fact that the sever was very attentive with us and came and checked on us quite often.. Defiantly will be back and defiantly recommend to other ppl who want a good BBQ joint on the west side of dt..  The don't take debit or credit cards, so I highly recommend to take cash with you if not theres a ATM upstairs where the washrooms are.. :)"}
{"text":"My co-worker Eli suggested I try out one of his favourite BBQ places in Toronto.  I decided to take my Sister-In-Law out for her birthday and did not tell her where we were going although I told her it was a BBQ place.  It was a surprise!  She had her assumptions that we were going here but I shot it down to confuse her.  When we arrived she was surprised!  At 9 PM on Saturday night, we get inside and all the tables were taken except for one lonely table.  Could it be ours?  Nope!  Highly unlikely.  The host told us that it would be an hour wait so he took my name down and said that he'd call me.  Peak hours, what can I say?  I saw 6 people ahead of me and there are no reservations which we knew.  We stroll to a nearby Coffee Time on Queen Street (lotta shady people in there).  It was about 10 minutes and I get a call from the host.  He said all the people dropped off the list and that our table was ready.  SCORE!  We have a table.  We scooted over there in a jiffy!  We pass by many people waiting and they give us the cold stare, like they wanted to rip our eyes out!  It's because we just head to the table!  We were there before.  Our waitress was totally nice but unfortunately told us that the Fried Chicken was sold out.  Oh no!  We were looking forward to it.  Oh well, next time.  We ordered:  Pork Side Ribs Montréal Smoked Beef Brisket in a bun Pulled Pork in a bun Collard Greens Potato Salad  Ribs had a delicious flavour.  It was smokey, tender, a tad fatty and pricey at $14.50 for 3 big ribs but good.  We got it without pecans just in case as I have a nut allergy.  I cannot tell you how much we LOVED the Beef Brisket.  We ordered 3 of them and had a \"communal brisket\" as we took turns taking bites from it.  It was one of the best tasting things I have ever had in my LIFE.  Now THAT is a dish!  The rest of the food was still great and totally affordable.  I know this is a hipster joint, packed, loud, dim and the smoke is up your nose from the BBQ grill but you go for the food.  The brisket is PHENOMENAL!!!!!  I have to go back for more!!!  What service, what food, what a great experience!"}
{"text":"Gotta really say the HYPE is for a GOOOOOOOOOOD reason!  When I first walked in and found out i'd have to wait 45 min for a table I wasn't thrilled at all. However, my experience was amazing ..   1) THE FOOD: Hands down quality. shared the beef ribs, fried chicken, and brisket sandwich .. flavor galore! The dry rub on the rubs brought out so much smoky goodness, all served with a horseradish bbq dipping sauce (8/10) . The chicken was done perfectly, drizzled in some kinda sweet love! crispy, crunchy .. full of flavor! finished off with a banana cream pie cup which really brought the whole mean together. Perfectly sweet and not overly decedent!  2) THE DRINK: Electric Mud is known for their bourbon specials! I enjoyed $4 shooters of Wild Turkey along with the infamous \"Porch Crawler\" - Gin, Watermelon Lemon-aid .. whats a better way to enjoy BBQ without bourbon and summer lemon-aid???? (9/10)   3) THE VIBE: Truly great vibe! especially when sitting at the bar!! over look a gorgeous blond that was chills. Playing vinyl, she acted as the DJ for the night .. from the Stones to Sabbath the music was on point! Everything to everyone working there was awesome and attending to every need we had! The vibe easily a 10/10 for me!!  THE OVER ALL: Amazing place, amazing people and even better food! Please don't be fooled by the comments on here .. this beats out the Stockyards any day !!!   THANKS FOR A GREAT NIGHT~"}
{"text":"This place is delicious I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! It looks a little like a crack shack at the side of the road with picnic benches at the front and modest decor. Make a reservation no matter when you come, this place fills up quickly!   The food is what really sets this place apart from the rest. I have tried many different BBQ restaurants in the city and they all seem to value quantity over quality. This place cooks everything perfectly and it all tastes delicious!   We came on a Thursday for their rib end special (with a dry rub and honey garlic on the side), which were beautifully seasoned and not overdone; the charred broccoli salad (which sounds weird), is delicious and a nice fresh element to the otherwise protein filled menu. The fired chicken was really good too, they have a coating that gets extra crispy while keeping the inside moist. The best is their chicken wings which are lightly glazed and perfectly cooked...AMAZING...ORDER THE CHICKEN WINGS!   Beer is beer and they also have house wine (weird...), and the cocktails are good, but not cheap unfortunately."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends last night for some BBQ. We sat in what would have been the outside patio but they have created a extension for his area with heater. I sat against the wall but it wasn't cold, honestly it was really warm in there. We got 2 of the BBQ Plates, the spicy pork grinds, fries and mac n cheese. The best items where the BBQ chicken on the BBQ plate and the mac n cheese. I might have expect more from this place as I had heard some really good things about it but I found it under whelming. I expecting the portions to be larger as I have seen at other BBQ places with the same prices.  One of the shining areas was the fact that each table has BBQ sauce on it and it was good, but they need some hot sauce there too."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Nothing special. Their crack rolls are great. Everything else sorta meh. Fried chicken is crispy on the outside but the skin is somehow still soft and gelatinous. Taste is there, but texture was off. Pork ribs were tough and somewhat flavorless.  Needs bbq sauce.  Liked the coleslaw. Would have ordered more if we had been enjoying our meal.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Everything here is over rated. Very small portions and not at all a classic bbq spot . A 20$ order of \"back ribs\" is two bones with a little bit of meat on it. Nice smoked flavour but WAY off the mark on what a quality meal for that price should constitute. I caution anyone that considers this place that there are MUCH better Bbq options in Toronto,like smoque n bones."}
{"text":"Second time going here, and ordered the fried chicken and ribs. Perfection! Sat outside on the patio area, and definately felt super cozy with everyone having a beer and enjoying their time on the weekend together."}
{"text":"3.5 - I've tried many BBQ spots in Toronto so I know good BBQ when I have it. It's too bad Electric Mud didn't make it on the list for me (but it is a decent spot).   We were here for the rib ends special night - ordered one for the table and thought it was okay. My friend ordered the fried chicken plate and I ordered the wings to share, I thought the fried chicken was okay as well. I do have to admit I think their wings are awesome. I don't like breaded wings so I thought their wings were delicious.   The restaurant itself is super hip. We sat on the patio with heaters and it was nice. The service was great as well. I'll definitely give it another shot and hope to have a better experience with the food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great selection of bourbon! Overpriced beer (over $6 a pint for Golden Horseshoe or electric lager as they call it. Is an extreme rip off considering it sells retail for $135 per keg!) except for Monday when it's sold at a discount price. Also I wish that they didn't change their beef rib, which used to be one of the most delish meals I've ever had! but now is only par!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly disappointing.   For a place that raves bbq, hence good quality meat. Electric Mudd was a loss. I ordered their cheeseburger for my bf. And brought it back home for it to be of \"slider-esque\" proportion.    When I spend $10 or more I don't expect to get a junior cheeseburger size from Wendys. All it took was two bites and it was gone. Not to mention it wasnt cooked all the way through. I don't know if it was supposed to be rare or medium rare. But he was not happy!  Cheeseburgers are supposed to be cooked all the way through, unless otherwise specified. No one even asked me when I placed the order on the phone.   Also, the guy told me 10 minutes. I ended up going there ten minutes later needing to wait an extra 5 to 10 minutes. And the wait was not worth it.  All round disappointed! The rating of 1 star out of 5 speaks for itself!  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was excellent and so was the coleslaw. The beef brisket was good, but the sauerkraut accompanying it was amazing. The fried beans were alright, and the pickled green tomatoes just weren't worth it. Overall I enjoyed my time here, the music was great but at moments too loud and the place is really rammed. Cash only as well."}
{"text":"Yet another hipster vibe, cash only overhyped joint in parkdale. I much admire the creativity and quality of food at sister restaurant Grand Electric, hence wanted to give them a shot. The patio was disappointingly small and the table setup is communal. The view from the patio is a bunch of dilapidated houses with clothes hanging on wires.   We tried one of the draft beers which was refreshing on a hot day. My wife had a cocktail which had a unique taste from the thai basil infused gin and distinctly pink from the watermelon.   Pork rinds were a good start with the cheese dip although they did not appear to be freshly made. We also had the squid po'boy which was good but nothing memorable.   The worst dish of the evening was the shrimp and grits. The consistency of the grits did not appeal to me. I prefer them creamy but here it was too watery for my taste. There were only 2 pieces of shrimp (without much flavor) which is not good value for the money you pay.  The fried chicken was the saving grace from the mains. I am not a huge fan of fried chicken since I think it is overrated. They serve it with a cider sauce which to be honest I found to be very mild and did not add anything to the dish but the chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The best part of the experience was the banana cream pie. There was so much natural banana flavor in the mousse that I can come back just to have this next time.   I will stick with the taco hipster joint next time and possibly stop by just to have dessert here which does not say a whole lot much for a BBQ place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for overpriced hipster kitsch this is the place for you. Get ready to over pay and get crammed whereVer they see fit. I went here for my birthday with a group of about 12 people and we arrived early as this place does not take reservations. You would think that they would welcome a big party, but it was like a chore to seat us; even though there was a table inside, we were suggested to go sit on the patio which is rather cold and uninviting.  One of our friends has an intolerance with smoked things and just wanted to order the squid sandwich minus the smoked mayo but apparently that was impossible according to the server because \"the chef wouldn't want to compromise the food by sending out something incomplete\" ... In much simpler food. She left to go get something to eat elsewhere and come back for Drinks and all these leeches asked was whether she would actually be buying something when she came back and subsequently gave away the two seat table adjoining us because of it.  The ribs were ok... With some people receiving 3 ribs and some receiving 4 ribs based on weight although they looked the same to me. Not super tender, small portions (3 pork ribs for $14) and all sides being extra. I've made better ribs iIn our home smoker; the ribs here are not tender and fall off the bone. The crack buns are like store bought egg buns with \"fancy\" butter: meh at best.   Another annoying thing about this place is they will serve food whenever it is ready \"for the sake of freshness\", so my side of beans came out a good 15-20 min before the ribs. Don't BBQ beans just come out of a giant pot that sits on low on the stove? You really mean to tell me you couldn't have scooped them up when you were getting the ribs out?  The icing on the cake was the waiter making a snide remark about the fact that we hadn't left him a big enough tip on our way out to my friends. Maybe if you weren't up your own pretentious asses with your over priced food, super cramped quarters and non-accommodating service you would fare better. Maybe if you would actually let people pay with credit/debit when you give us a 350+ bill you might get a bigger tip. Definitely not going back here again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was DYING for a cold beer and the LCBO couldn't deliver (Saturday afternoon... everything was warm). We walked by this place (it's right beside the LCBO).  He needed a drink, I needed a restroom. It was packed so we thought it must be good. It's cash only as others have said. There is an ATM upstairs where the washrooms are (the posters up there made me laugh ahaha). We ordered the \"grand electric\" and one of the other beers they had on tap. Both were delicious. Once we were inside I figured we might as well try the food. We did just have sandwiches... but how could we Yelp it if we didn't try anything to eat! Vlad and I got the beef brisket sandwich. Mmmm it was so good. It had chipotle mayo (big fans of that) and crispy onions. It was covered with barbeque sauce. The sandwich was so juicy it was running down my hand lol. It was about $6. Sides are not included. You can get baked beans, collard greens, and a few other things for $3.50 each. There are no fries though (that we saw). This place is busy. It definitely reminded me of the restaurants you'd see on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives. I loved watching the chefs prepare everything. Also, although it was a scalding hot day, I didn't find it too hot inside, just perfectly comfortable. I would recommend popping by this pleasant little place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My friend came here with his girlfriend a while ago and raved about this BBQ place, so I had to try it. My friend and I got a spot right away at the bar on a Friday night around 9:30pm. We wanted to order the pork rinds on the side and fried chicken, but they were already sold out!!! We ended up ordering the buffalo califlower, dry rub wings, beef brisket sandwich and ribs. I also ordered a drink which was gin with a sour mix of watermelon. The buffalo califlower and ribs were ok. The wings were amazing with the dry rub. The beef brisket sandwich wasn't anything special. If I had to pick between smokes and this BBQ place, smokes would still be a winner!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  We arrived at 7 pm and the place was full, but we still managed to snag a table on the heated outdoor terrace. Then, we ordered a bunch of dishes on the menu to share.  I could talk about the Ribs, the Fried Chicken or even the Smoked Chicken with house BBQ sauce, but, let's be real, you'd expect those things to be delicious at a place with the word BBQ in the name. The real surprise was the homemade Sausage with Brussel Sprouts and Chanterelle Mushrooms (every bite was more complex and awesome - not to sound to much like a food snob) or my first ever Shrimp and Grits with Smoked Ham which, by the way actually did melt in my mouth.  Desert consisted of Banana Cream Pie, Buttermilk Pie and Cornbread with Maple Pecan Ice cream. The standout was definitely the Buttermilk Pie which none of us had ever tried before.  All in all, this is some of the best food I've had in Toronto so far.  My tip: Order all the sides! (I've never liked vinegar based coleslaw this much before)."}
{"text":"Do you know how hard it is to find a place in the city that takes reservations for a large party and doesn't make you get a pre set/family style dinner?  Let me tell you that it's pretty darn near impossible.   Enter Electric Mud. My birthday fell on a day that they were closed but not to be deterred I opted to move my festivities to another day. I reserved online and called to ask how large of a party I could save space for (Online the max number is 8 but pro tip you can write in the notes how large your party will be). It's 16 but you could squeeze 18 into the picnic tables on the heated patio.   SO, here goes some notes on our experience: service was quick and attentive.  They allowed us to split the bills by tables (we had 3 tables) but they don't generally split bills. Just a heads.   Nothing is truly veggie friendly ( duh it's a bbq place) but I definitely blanked on that.  Their pitchers of cocktails go quite far and are great for splitting amongst a larger group of folx.  They graciously allowed us to bring in a cake and cut it up and served it for us. What a lovely gesture that was much appreciated.   This is one of the places that I would consider a last meal on earth place."}
{"text":"I would rate as a solid 3.5 stars. Friendly attentive service with minimal wait even when they were busy and a bit understaffed. We tried burgers ( very tasty, nice soft potato bun), pulled pork sandwich - really good pork, bun  a bit soggy. Spicy Fried Chicken was huge - think one large chicken breast - that was moist and tasty but in a fairly impenetrable fried batter. I think it may have been fried a bit too long - chipped off most of the outside and ate the inside. Coleslaw, potato and fried cauliflower and celery salads were all solid."}
{"text":"+++ - Beef ribs, theres only two, but one can make a meal  ++ - Pork ribs we succulent as well, but beef is definitively better - Altough drink menu is slim, they are string and original. I enjoyed the lemonade  + - Corn is great - Friendly wait staff that gave good suggestions - Fried chicken looked amazing, but we didn't order  TIPS: - CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"COME HERE ON MONDAYS! $2.50 HOUSE DRAFTS!  Alright, now that we have gotten that out of the way we can talk about the food.   I have been here twice and have ordered the buffalo wings, fried chicken,catfish po boy, and potato salad as a side.  Wings were OK. My boyfriend and I aren't really wing people and we weren't crazy about 'em. Fried chicken is great - crisp on the outside, tender and moist on the inside with a delicious gravy. It comes with three pieces and I always pray my boyfriend has to use the bathroom before we're finished so I can make a move on the last piece without getting my hand stabbed with a fork (we're serious eaters). The smoked catfish was delicious and I loved the roll it was served on. Seriously loved that subtle smokiness and the texture was great. Potato salad is crunchy and yummy and is a really good sized portion.  Ambiance is casual and cool and it's suitable for a date, a small get-together, or a larger group can fit on the picnic tables."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  VIBE  I have a confession: I go to the most popular restaurants in Toronto on Long Weekends. That said, Electric Mud BBQ's patio was full and there was no problem to get a picnic table to ourselves inside (we were lucky). This the road side stop the hipsters have dreamed of. I think plaid is definitely encouraged but it seems like the look these summer days are tanks and denim shirts. All on board for the chambray. I love that the owners took Stampede Bison (which was a seemingly clean place) and made it down and dirty. Just like the manner in which you want to eat their food.   Service is attentive and laid back.   WE ATE/DRANK  I had the Clydesdale - a great, refreshing bourbon cocktail with a citrus twist. Everyone was ordering the Porch Crawler, however. (This is an excuse for next time.)  We definitely came to the right place to EAT: for us, it was all about the chicken.   The roasted chicken thigh on special was hot and spicy. Mayo and green onions give it another textural and flavourful twist.   The fried chicken was my favourite - as attested in other reviews, it's one of those dishes that I wanted to lick clean. It was chewy, crispy and had that buttermilk moistness that feels like someone from down south just smothered you with love (but in chicken format).   The fried corn at $3.50 was also spot-on. Forget the corn at those Mexican places across the city. This was a great accompaniment (and I think they do it better without the bragging).   We couldn't end it without dessert and the Mud Pie was an excellent choice. Chocolate ice  cream (an upgrade from the Mr. Softie Ice Cream Truck type) covered in chocolate sauce make a perfect accompaniment for crushed Oreo crumbs on the bottom of a mason jar (I mentioned it was hipster, right?)   In terms of value, for two drinks and the menu above, we paid $47.50 (without tip). Let's compare this to our previous venture at Foxley for two appetizers that came out to $40 with tax and tip, leaving us hungry after our meal.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Oh, it's gettin DIRTY in here! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, but may be the worst service I've ever had. It was like they actually didn't want to make any money. We were a table of 9 that came in a little over an hour before close on a Thursday, we left before close, and we spent $200. Get over yourselves. I actually almost got up and left twice it was so bad. It was actually two different servers that were really rude to us too- not just one person having a bad day, this was like a disease that ran through the place. Server #1 treated us like petulant children and tried to flex some 'rules' about saving tables on us when no one was even waiting for tables aside from us. I get the rules, don't seat the party until everyone is there, but on a quiet Thursday? Come on bud. Lighten up. Server #2 was also saltier then the pork rinds (which are freakin' delicious by the way).  THAT SAID, I'm glad I stayed as the food and drinks themselves were impeccable and totally inspired.  Extremely tasty, prepared with care, everything was appropriately priced and I would definitely go back.  I'll just go back expecting to be treated like crap next time and all should be well.  Could have been a 5/5 star review, but two snippy servers will lose you two stars, sorry guys. Can I recommend a re-hire? Happy to change my review if things are better next time."}
{"text":"Simply put, their crack rolls will blow your d*ck off.   When I was a kid, I'd go to Red Lobster and spoil my entire meal by eating 27 of their cheese biscuits. As an adult, I'm doing the same thing at Electric Mud. If you go there and order 6 baskets of these and nothing else, you will be happy. Probably judged by your server and those around you, but happy.  The pork ribs were also insane. Collard Greens were average."}
{"text":"What can I say...simply frigging amazing!!! What a great spot to have some of the best  BBQ in Toronto.  I strongly suggest that you try this place.  While the first impression may be a bit of an eye opener the quality of the food, attention to service and the simply menu makes this a place to dine.  The atmosphere is awesome and the patio is wonderful, it's also covered and heated in the winter from what I hear.  One of Toronto's gems.     Back again and it's still great!!"}
{"text":"Veedict - 4.5/5. I can't wait for my 2nd visit!  Had dinner plans in Parkdale yesterday at another location but there was a mixup with the time. I was starving & couldn't wait so I ended up dining solo here.  Decor & atmosphere -3/5 - It is a small place. I sat at the bar. Not much of decor but the music went with the place.  Drink - 5/5 -  the peach cocktail was very good. I can't remember if it is called the Peach Fuzz or the Peach Buzz. I got it with bourbon instead of vodka.  Food -  Appetizer - 5/5 - I got the hushpuppies as the pork rinds were not available. The hushpuppies were very good. I dunked them in the butter they came with. I highly recommend it.  Main - 4/5 - I ordered the fried chicken plate. Three big pieces of fried chicken came with a spicyish gravy. Now I have never had southern style fried chicken before & I personally won't have it again. The chicken was good. The crust was amazing BUT it is just not my thing. I prefer chicken with very little crust like karage. Again I am glad I tried but I won't order it next time. It has nothing to do with the way they made it. I realized it is just not ny thing as it is too heavy for me.   Service - 5/5 - excellent!! The bar staff recommended the drink & food & I was happy with it. Friendly & prompt service. I was solo & they were welcoming.  I can't wait to go back to try the pork rinds! Next time I am going to call before I go ;)."}
{"text":"This place is way overhyped! Decent food in a hippie garage style getup however prices are a bit hefty to not accept credit cards! A bit annoying to be directed to the ATM machines to cover a $50 light meal for two! Good to try but way overrated!  First thing I noticed on the menu was milk buns, basically bread for $3.75? Pass!  Ordered the Pork Rind with pimento cheese which seems to be like fancy spicy cream cheese or cream cheese mixed with jalapeño & onions!  Ribs were kinda meh! Def had better! If ur looking for fall-off-the-bone kinda ribs, go elsewhere! Meat were rather stuck on bones! Tried their beef brisket in a bun (which resembled more like deli corned beef than brisket!) Though great, it seemed like half of the sandwich was missing! Not filling enough so we ordered the Po Boy squid sandwich which was a bit overcooked!  Good to try but doubt will come back!"}
{"text":"Honestly just smoke some ribs and do it right. And take the skin off the chicken before you fry it, no one wants to bite into deep fried membrane between skin and meat. Keep it simple guys! Thanks."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! Highly recommend the BBQ platter and the crack buns are unreal.  Service is great as well"}
{"text":"If you are afraid of biting your fingers off, don't go to this place, it is really that GOOD! The overall decor is relaxingly (that's the word) rustic, small and filled with constant buzz from all the conversations happening simultaneously. Tall and handsome Sous chef/DJ spins vinyl records while preparing pig ears, so sexy! All chefs wear white t-shirts lovingly hugging every biceps curve on their working hands so capable of producing culinary orgazms, servers are friendly, attentive and full of knowledgeable recommendations.  The food flows nicely with the atmosphere, saucy ribs covered with crusty peanuts, crispy but fatty pig tails, delicious hushpuppies and OMG banana cream pie that's to die for, am I in heaven already?  Go and discover for yourself the feeling of vivifying electricity running from your eyes to your guts to the fingertips, just be careful not to bite off the latter."}
{"text":"Waited, approximately 20 minutes as my friends and I were craving some good Fried Chicken. After multiple good reviews we decided that electric mud would be a great option.  Unfortunately the table that came AFTER us us ordered the last Fried Chicken yet we ordered the chicken first? How do they get it and we dont? obviously some poor communication     I'm sorry but I'm super serious about my Fried Chicken so that really just set my mood.  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich instead.  My friends ordered Cauliflower buffalo things, more brisket and smoked chicken.."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a few minutes as we were waiting for a table at Grand Electric. We had the pork rinds and crack buns, both fantastic. Looking forward to returning here for some fried chicken (which they ran out of, so come early I guess). Service was fast. The whole restaurant was very informal which was appealing considering it's dirty bbq :D"}
{"text":"Get here early! This place has become pretty popular ever since it changed from Stampede Burger. I've been here on Friday and Saturday nights and it was busy every time. Luckily there are some great bars down the road where you can wait for you to be called or texted when you're up for seating.  The restaurant has a down to earth, southern dive feel complete with neon lights, bourbon, and the smell of smoked wood and bbq.   The menu is up on the wall. I like how it's straightforward and simple, sticking to what they do best, BBQ of course. You get choices of pork ribs, beef ribs, brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, and hot links (grilled spicy sausage).   The beef back rib is amazing. You get 1-2 pieces of hunking ribs, smoked and grilled with a tremendous amount of flavour. The brisket sandwich is another favourite of mine, also grilled and smoked, packed with flavour, wrapped in a plain sesame bun. The hot links (rather hot link because they give you one) is a great appetizer to share, though its listed as a main. It's spicy, juicy, and like everything else there, smokey.   At first glance, it may seem pricey for the amount you get, but the flavour and the overall bbq-ey meatiness of all the dishes leave you full and happy. Compliment that with their bourbon mixes, and you're in for a good night."}
{"text":"With so many good places to eat in Toronto, I would have never guessed this place would be my best meal of the trip. At the recommendation of a bartender, we came here for dinner on a Saturday night. FYI, be prepared to wait if you come on the weekends... We put in our names and waited for about 30 minutes.   The seating is family style along a bench with a long table, so we were seated next to a random couple. The whole place has a hippy/grunge atmosphere while also being very upbeat. Now on to the food!!  We started with the Crack Rolls which come with smoked butter. No lie, one of the top 5 things I've ever eaten. We ended up getting another order after devouring it in 2 minutes. You could literally eat these all night.. The butter is apparently made with drippings from the meat on the grill, so you're literally warming up your taste buds for the deliciousness that's about to come..  I then got an order or pork ribs which were delicious. Tender meat that was falling off the bone with every bite and just the right amount of sauce. Also got a side order or baked beans which was also delicious and the perfect compliment to the ribs.   Everything about the experience at this place was outstanding. Great hangout spot, upbeat and amazing food. An absolute must in Toronto."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the flash fried beef ribs! Ah, and the banana cream pie!!! So good. The beef brisket sandwich was kind of a scam, more like thin slices pastrami, but all of the things can't be winners. Besides that, our waitress was really cool and sent us off to some interesting places. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: duckhamFRIEDCHICKENduckhamFRIEDCHICKEN  First it was tacos, then it was ramen, and now it's BBQ joints! The endless hunt for the \"next best thing\" is the madness that is Toronto these days. The one trend I can't wait to die is the insistence of cash-only (not even debit) policy. Coupled with absent or malfunctioning ATMs, it's makes for a pretty ridiculous user experience.   The Grand Electric pedigree of Electric Mud is clear from the casual, country/southern, barnyard atmosphere. Replace the hip-hop soundtrack with country-rock/jazz, and voila! The open kitchen concept ensures your clothes will continue providing olfactory cues long after you've left. The servers were friendly and efficient. The tables and chairs still had a sticky residue on it, though thankfully, didn't stain my clothes.  If you only order 2 items, it'll have to be, you guessed it, the DUCK HAM and FRIED CHICKEN. The duck was juicy, tender with just enough fat so that it slides down easy - it was by consensus, the dish of the night. The fried chicken isn't perfect (while perfectly crispy and not dripping with oil, the skin also falls off pretty easily), but it's pretty damn big and juicy. And I'm a sucker for fried chicken. Still, I think Stockyards holds the prize here for the best fried chicken in town.  My DCs and I also ordered the RIBS, which were flavourful but not as tender as I usually like them. There were mixed reactions to the peanuts sprinkled on top but I was neutral on this.   Their PORK BELLY was served on toast and was nicely portioned, a bit chewy, but it's pork, and so, obviously, oh-so-delicious. I'm not sure if there'll be enough pork bellies in the world to support the taco, ramen and, now, BBQ joints of Toronto!  The PIG TAILS are the equivalent of \"Phoenix Claws\" from dim sum restos, except with way more meat and cartilage, and way less bone. +1 for the blue cheese dipping sauce!   Finally, we ordered sides of COLESLAW and COLLARD GREENS. Um, $3.50 for a tiny bowl of veggies? Someone better revisit the pricing structure because that's a rip-off.  They had a few cocktails available, that didn't seem to complement their VAST bourbon selection available. I'm sure this will change with time. My DCs definitely enjoyed what was made though. Great selection of beers on tap with fantastic looking tap handles!  Overall, it came out the $40/person including drinks, tax, and tip, which was better than expected given the seemingly pricey menu. Too bad Smoke BBQ House on Harbord closed down after their brief stint, because that's the place to go to get filled up for cheap!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a side street in Parkdale, this BBQ joint is tiny, loud and claustrophobic. The space probably holds no more than 20 people with the possibility of doubling in size when the patio opens up in the summer. Cash only and no reservations. An ATM can be found upstairs, awkwardly placed in front of the entrance to the ladies washroom. There is bound to be some wait time but sampling their extensive selection of bourbon is a great way to pass this time.   They serve up southern-inspired food with hip twist. I didn't feel like the food lived up to the hype. The ribs and fried chicken were ok but fall short of my top 10 list for the city and it would do far worse in comparison to what's in the States. The chicken especially was way too greasy. The super crispy shell-like batter comes off in one piece and it's spice composition is pretty lacklustre in terms of flavour. The dip is essentially pure honey. The ribs were, again, not the best in Toronto but a step up from the chicken for sure. They were saucy and tender. Not exactly fall off the bone but that is my preference anyway. I think $13.50 is a tad much to ask for 3 ribs.   The service is efficient and I have to acknowledge their courtesy of bringing in the food as soon as it was ready. BBQ tastes so much better when it's served hot."}
{"text":"Alright, let's break it down:  1) Food: Great food. The brisket sandwich was excellent, easy to eat. Crisp, flavourful fried chicken. Tasty wings. Lovely ribs, the meat came right off the bone. They also had wonderful sauces to go with the dishes.  2) Service: Largely pretty quick. As you can tell we ordered a bunch of stuff and didn't have to wait too long to get our food. The server was also quite helpful, he made suggestions as to what and how much we should order.  3) Price: You could say it's a bit pricey but really not the worst. Again, we ordered ribs, fried chicken, wings, brisket, shrimp & grits and a beer and split it between 5 people. Came to about $19 per person.   4) Layout: They had an inside and outside section. Inside was the bar, outside seating was on benches WITH blankets and substantial heating. Pretty neat."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place while we were waiting for a table at it's Mexican-counterpart, Grand Electric. This restaurant was not nearly as packed, and so we decided to grab a quick snack in the midst of our hour-long wait.  We collectively ordered the calamari po boy ($can't remember) and the brisket po boy ($7.95). Both orders arrived quickly and simultaneously. The calamari was covered in a crema-type sauce and green onions, with green chilli salsa and lemon wedges on the side. The brisket was covered in bbq sauce, chipotle mayo, and green onions. What I particularly loved about the sandwiches were the buns. Having eaten po boys in Louisiana, I've developed a deep appreciation for appropriately-selected sandwich bread that holds well against the juiciness of the meat and sauces. In other words, bread that will not fall apart on you mid-devourment.  After this experience, I am excited to return to try out the other menu items, especially the ribs and fried chicken. Easy 5 stars!"}
{"text":"In a word?  Overrated.  Electric Mud is by no means a bad restaurant, but I'm not sure where all the 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from.  The food is solid, with one or two standouts.  I came here because there's been alot of talk about the fried chicken being the best in the city, and I have no idea where anyone's getting that impression.  There's alot of value on the Electric Mud menu, but at the same time there are some pitfalls and traps set for first-timers who aren't quite sure what's hit and what's miss.  It's a weird set of offerings that way.  To give you an idea, I'm going to do something I don't normally do and note the prices for everything we had.    Then I'm gonna b**** about it.  Crack Rolls - $3.75 - It's four small buns with a side of whipped smoked butter.  And that's fine.  It's bread.  And some kind of sweet butter.  But it's nothing to rave about, and at 3.75 it's one of many strange cash grabs on a menu that if approached properly, can offer extremely good value.  Skip this one.  Bar-b-cue Pork (sandwich) - $5.00 - Pulled and saucy pork shoulder, cooked to a perfect tenderness and topped with perfunctory slaw?  This was delicious, and easily the one thing we had that might be worth coming back for.  And it's five bucks.  Totally worth it.  Beef Brisket (sandwich) - $5.50 - This is billed as \"Montreal style\" brisket, served with chipotle mayo (aren't we done with chipotle mayo?  I know I am.  Jesus), a solid bbq sauce, onions, and an overpowering provolone that shouldn't be here.  If you're wondering what Montreal style brisket is, it's apparently brisket cut so thin that it's like luncheon meat instead of delicious barbecue.  Somewhere, a Texan is crying.  What's with Toronto and the lack of good barbecued brisket?  Barque is the only place I can think of that manages to do a basic brisket properly in the entire city.  (And it's worth noting - their brisket's amazing.)  Rib Ends - $7.00 - These were probably as good as rib ends can be.  They're serviceable, with some smokey flavor and crispy texture, but this is inherently dry meat we're talking about.  The portion was surprisingly large, though, so there's that.  I wouldn't order this again.  Fried Chicken - $9.50 - Again, at 4 pieces of fried chicken for $9.50 the value isn't unfair.  It's a solid addition to the menu, consisting of chicken thighs buttermilk-brined into extreme tenderness, and then placed into a puddle of unnecessary gravy, cider syrup, and hot sauce that kind of turns the whole thing into a sloppy mess.  It was alright, but it really didn't live up to the hype.  Stockyards' fried chicken is still far and away the best in Toronto.  Coleslaw - $5.50 - Buh?  This is a portion of slaw for one, that inexplicably costs more than the pulled pork sandwich.  The vinegar slaw's passable, but again it pales in comparison to the slaw at Stockyards.  They really kill you on the sides.  The service was friendly, but somewhat inattentive; there were times when emptied plates and dishes sat at length at our table, and there was very little attention paid to our drinks, or lack thereof when we needed more of them.  The space is nice, or at least nicer than sister restaurant Grand Electric - the conversation-killing music played at unspeakable volume has been toned down for something a little more diner-friendly, which is a blessing.  There's nothing like an evening at Grand Electric, spent screaming into the face of your dining partner.  That said, I feel like the heritage behind this place is kind of the problem: I think if Electric Mud wasn't carrying a bunch of hype off its affiliation with Grand Electric, we wouldn't even know it exists.    Stockyards and Barque just do it better."}
{"text":"I came one night during the week with two other friends to try something new before I took off for a trip back to Calgary.  The restaurant is small and it was busy the night we visited. There was one table open but the server was reluctant to seat us as they were holding it for a group. They said that if we promised to be gone within an hour that we could have the table. We obliged.  The best thing to do here is treat this place like a tapas restaurant. Order a bunch of items from the menu and share with the table. We tried the sausage, ribs, fried chicken, a couple desserts, slaw, and I'm sure there was something else that I'm forgetting.  I started with a Bellwoods Bootknife. It was great to see a local brewery here and it was also great that I could finally try one of Bellwoods brews since their brewpub is always too packed to get into.  Overall the food was excellent. The most memorable thing for me was the ribs. They were different than any ribs I've had at a restaurant before and had a unique flavour. The big miss for me was the desserts. For the price, you really only get a taste and the portion needs to be at least 50% larger.  On face value, the menu prices seemed on the high side. However, we left with full bellies and when we broke down the cost per person at the end of the meal it came out to be quite reasonable for the three of us."}
{"text":"Electric Mudd BBQ is an interesting place for different reasons. The charming setup and atmosphere is memorable as is the menu selection and quality of food. The establishment is a BBQ tapas style that at times charges a little much for the quantity of food you get on a plate, but thats the standard for this style of restaurant in the city. The dishes themselves are very tasty, but for every good dish, there's a particular restaurant that serves the same thing but better. Whats interesting about Electric Mudd is that while they may not be the best of the best in the city at one particular dish, everything on the menu is very good. The restaurant has a jack of all trades, master of none characteristic. Its not a bad thing though, that just means you can order anything off the menu with a high degree of confidence that it will be awesome. At times you may be wishing there was more on the plate based on how much your paying but it all tastes great. There's plenty of good BBQ in the city and its safe to say that Electric Mud is among the better places in the city because of its varied consistency of quality throughout the menu.  The ribs, fried chicken, brisket, crack rolls and coleslaw where the highlights for me."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the good reviews. The service was good but the food was terrible. My friend ordered the fried chicken and it was a very thick breading with almost no chicken. I had the brisket sandwich and almost every bite tasted like a biteful of fat. The bun was soggy and burnt. The fries tasted like they were from the freezer and had no flavor.  This was one of the worst meals I've ever had and I wouldn't even go back  if it was free."}
{"text":"I had a draft. Yelp lost it. Here's the short form. Cocktails fine. Service, nice, friendly but a bit smarmy. The ribs were a tasty dry rub with sauce on the side. Tender with some firmness. The shrimp and grits are a win. Large grits and plump shrimps (though too few). Portions too small. Buffalo Cauliflower came late and was meh.  In a market replete with barbecue joints, Electric Mud is a pass."}
{"text":"I finally got to try out Electric Mud BBQ; a popular Southern-inspired barbecue establishment in Parkdale. I heard that it can get quite busy around dinner time so my companion and I decided to have an extremely late dinner. We arrived at Electric Mud BBQ a little past midnight. The kitchen actually closes around 1:00 am so we still had time to eat and there was no wait. Also note that this restaurant is run by the same people as Grand Electric.   We started off with the crack rolls ($3.75). The basket arrived with four rolls, and they were warm, golden, and fluffy. The whipped butter spread that accompanied the rolls was absolutely divine as the butter was made from the fat dripping in the smoker.  Another side that we got was the coleslaw ($3.50). I am not a huge of coleslaw in general, but I really liked the one from Electric Mud BBQ. The reason why was that the dish wasn't completely drenched in mayonnaise and it had a nice tangy taste to it.   The fried chicken ($9.50) was absolutely delicious and I'd return just for it. The outside was lightly seasoned and its skin was ultra crispy. I really liked that the inside of the chicken was moist and juicy with a lot of flavor. Additionally, the dish was served with a side of honey sauce and Tabasco hot sauce. In my opinion, the two sauces definitely helped to accentuates the flavor of the chicken pieces.  The beef rib ($15.00) wasn't really my favorite of the night, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. The dish consists of one piece of mid-sized beef rib and topped with green onions. The rib itself was tender and the smoky flavor was infused into the meat.   We were informed around 1:00 am that the kitchen was closing soon. So we decided to end the night off with ribs ($14.50). The dish came with four pieces of delectable bones of meat, and topped off with peanuts and green onions. The flavor of the ribs was well balanced as it wasn't overly sweet, or too smoky tasting. Additionally, I liked the overall presentation of the dish as it looked both tasty and aesthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"We didn't mean to be eager beavers and show up exactly 19 minutes before the restaurant opened, but one member of our party wasn't here yet and we figured we would just hang out outside. A staff member was quick to come outside and tell us they didn't open until exactly 5 and that we were early and couldn't wait on the patio. Luckily we smiled adorably and they let us get away with waiting on the patio. That being said, I am a nervous nelly and was constantly worried they'd try to kick us off again. Every time someone came close to the restaurant I jumped to say \"No! They are not open until 5!\" - so worried that if others joined us on the patio we'd be told to line up behind the dreaded fence chain.  The call them 'crack buns' for a reason. My aunt Joan makes buns that would blow you away but these run a close second. They deserve a star on their own.   The corn is ok. Have you had the corn at momofuku? Also not great. Same experience for me. Hype followed by nothing. I can do that at home. With better corn. Maybe this is just because I grew up next to a corn field.   We ordered the ribs and when the beef rib arrived we were surprised to see it was 1 rib. But it was huge. Four of us took chunks off that rib and we revelled in it's deliciousness. The've hit the nail on the head with their sauce, the smokiness, the pucker... I am not allowed to say anything bad about Barque (I love Barque) but the sauce at Electric Mud gave it  all a run for it's money.   At the end of the meal, after we had ordered several plates of food and the air was thick with smoke, I sat back in my chair, listened to Otis Redding sing \"These Arms of Mine\" and felt true happiness.   I should also mention that the waitress spilled fanta on my new iPhone but the meal and the atmosphere and my happiness overshadowed that quite quickly.   SJ"}
{"text":"This place was definitely a unique experience (in a good way). I had ribs, though I wish I had the fried chicken because I tasted it and it was fantastic. The ribs were fairly good. Sat out on the patio, and got to experience the unique culture in this part of toronto!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, low key atmosphere. I loved it. You need to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Great find! The wait staff was not only very friendly but also accomodating during a busy time of the night. They had old records playing which suited the spot appropriately and created such a fun atmosphere. The host hung our coats and had our seats ready at the bar in record time. The bartender wasted no time in getting us drinks and making sure we were looked after.  About ten minutes after ordering our food we were greeted by our appetizer. Crack rolls. The smoked butter made my SO ask \"what the hell?how did they do that?\" It was honestly rob ford worthy. The rolls were soft, warm and delicious. Off to a great start.  Just as we finished up with our crack rolls the waiter brought our pork ribs and fried chicken. The ribs had a spicy but sweet sauce on them and fell off the bone with little effort. The fried chicken was not only cooked to perfection but boneless to my surprise.  The sauce complimented the chicken beautifully and was overall a great eat.   My overall rating : Lord ford"}
{"text":"Came here to see what all the hype was about but was pretty disappointed. Their portions could only feed a small troll, yet is quite expensive. Actually went out to find more food afterwards. To be fair, their ribs do have a really nice and strong flavour, which is what all the hype has been about. Just not worth it for me though."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times. I've had almost everything on the menu, but the fried chicken and the brisket sandwich keeps me coming back. They are truly must order dishes. I don't typically go for any of the sides, in favor of the rib ends or hot links (if they haven't sold out of them yet). If I had one knock against Electric Mud its the size of the tables and the amount of people they try to squeeze around them. Electric Mud tries to squeeze 6 people into tables that can just about hold 4. It's a small negative against a fantastic joint. Check it out. Tell em Kevin sent you. They'll have no idea who you're talking about, but if enough people do it, they eventaully will."}
{"text":"I'm not very familiar with BBQ or southern style cooking, but I have to say everything was very good.  I even liked their corn and I'm not a corn eater."}
{"text":"So wait, is Canada known for their BBQ? I'm confused... because this BBQ was phenomenal. Like finger licking good as if I were in the deep South. But I was in Canada, with a lot of hipsters in jorts. I guess you could also find jorts in the South as well, so the setting seemed right.  Regardless of location, the food was good. Real good. I NEVER order chicken unless I'm confident it's gonna be good. I took a gamble just by reading the reviews and am so glad I did. It was moist and had a great smokey flavor, with a slightly crispy skin. Their own BBQ sauce is on the table to use as you choose, but the chicken itself was so good, I barely had to use any at all. Plus, you get two healthy wings of chicken with your order.  You also get coleslaw, which was also really good. I was sad it was only a dollop because it was so tasty. It honestly wasn't that big of a deal though because by the time we I had eaten my portion, plus a shared bowl of baked beans, I was stuffed. Oh, and also get the crack rolls. They're correctly named, I can attest to that. I think they had sea salt sprinkled on with a smokey butter.   It's a small place, so if you have more than two people dining, you may be in for a  wait. But we were able to slip right in with two people and were outta there pretty quickly too. Just remember your jorts or you may feel left out."}
{"text":"Colin Tooke and Ian McGrenaghan, the duo behind Grand Electric (@grandelectricTO) (post here) open up a sister restaurant called Electric Mud BBQ (@ElectricMudBBQ) which open up rather quietly/ without much hyped less than 2 weeks ago.   Ben and I decided to venture there this past Friday and we got there at around 8:00pm and waited for around 45 minutes for a table... It wasn't that bad since they take down your number and call you when the table is ready (we went nest door to Kanji for some sake). We were seated right next to the door which was freezing cold since the door keep opening and they don't even have a curtain or double door to break up the breeze. This deducted major points for us since not only we were cold but the food gets cold withing seconds   The tacos have been replaced with Southern inspired BBQ but with some not so traditional dishes like pig ears and pig tails    They offer a few cocktails selection which are mostly bourbon base and also beer on tap or by the bottle/can. Ben tried the Agua Loca Lager $6 and I went with one of my fave Montreal beer, Corne du Diable $8   Be careful of how many dishes you order since everything tends to come at once and given where our table was, a lot of dishes we tried was cold by the time we ate it.   Pork Rinds $3.50 ~ This was served warm with seasoning sprinkled on top which was spicy which I love...  ~ love it so much that I order a 2nd to finish up my glass of beer.   Crispy Pig's Ear Salad $10.50  ~ w/ an egg, romaine lettuce and a buttermilk dressing ~ The dressing was was too sweet and the pig's ear wasn't that crispy...  ~ this was dish failed  for us even though I love pig's ear, after just a bite Ben gave up on this and I had to finish the whole thing.  Buffalo Pig's Tails $12.50 ~ It was a fatty flavorful fall-off-the-bone goodness and definitely our fave dish of the night   Ribs $13.50 ~ Love the peanut-crusted presentation and the sauce but thought the ribs wasn't the fall off the bone type that we like  Pork Belly $12.50 ~ First of all, wasn't impress with the \"wonder\" bread presentation which felt out of place... as if the only purpose was to fill up the plate space.  ~ The pork belly wasn't crispy nor melt in your mouth good.. it wasn't bad but just really not memorable.   Soft Serve Ice Cream $3.50  NOTE ~  they only take cash, we didn't had enough and their ATM didn't work so Ben had to walk a block over to a bank at the end of the meal. So better be prepare and get bring enough cash.   Verdict : ~ Need to go back to try the Fried Chicken (was sold out) & Duck Ham ~ will be back for more of the Pig's Tails & Pork Rinds for sure. ~ Service was great and very friendly. ~ The music was super loud (w/not so great speakers), so not a place to go if you want to chat. ~ Wish they would do something about their door since it wasn't even a very cold night since cold food ruins everything."}
{"text":"Located just around the corner of their sister restaurant off queen street, is this standalone unit, with a covered patio, bbq house. It looks like it use to be a home and they turned it into a restaurant. It's a cozy environment, seating is tight so I would recommend going with a small group (up to 4 people) and to make reservations. Casual dining, picnic tables set up in the patio area and some tables inside. Love that they source their meats from ethically raised farms in Ontario!   Food was very well prepared and cooked. Flavour or the ribs were very tasty and meat was still tender and almost fall off the bone. Milk buns are made by the local bakery on queen street and the toasted butter goes very well with the warm, soft buns.  The Catfish burger was good but I didn't find that the fish had anything that could \"steal the show\". May have been that the condiments were over powering the fish patty. Fries that came with the fish burger were great!  Will come here again if in the area."}
{"text":"This place is freakin' gastronomically mind blowing. Kick off by ordering some some crack rolls and you're off to a good start (sesame rolls with smoked butter). From there on..everything is pretty much amazing! The only dish that left me with a \"meh\" feeling were the collared greens, otherwise everything is tasty! The dishes are meant to be shared, so bring friends along with you. Just a heads up, it can start to add up once you start ordering. Our table did a good amount of damage to the menu, and the bill  came out to around $30 (food cost) in the end. But is it worth it? Absolutely!  Must tries: Beef ribs: yes, a bit pricey, but you don't cut threw these ribs with a knife, you cut it with a fork.  Deep fried cauliflower with blue cheese. Rib ends Pulled Pork sandwich. This will change your whole understanding of pulled pork.  Beef Brisket sandwich (if you're sharing, portion around 2 person per sandwich).  Fried chicken: perfectly crispy skin, meat is super moist and juicy with this interesting sauce they put on bottom."}
{"text":"Not the best BBQ I've had, but a very solid experience: good food, great service, GREAT drink specials.  Getting in around 15 min before closing on a Friday night, our server knew how to play to his audience. First question: \"would you like our $4 wild turkey special\" yes please.  The ribs were okay, the sausage was dry, but the smoked chicken and fried chicken were both GREAT!  Rib tips were also a great shareable dish."}
{"text":"Another doesn't-take-reservations, bourbon-soaked, cash-only haunt in Parkdale has popped up. Naturally, I'm in love, but the above qualities (aside from the bourbon cocktails) will keep them from tipping to a five star rating. But please, don't let my impatience with lines and inability to carry cash affect you getting your buns to Electric Mud and trying all of their deliciously drrrty* flavours.   Seating is old school picnic tables, menus are over the cooking area on old-school boards, and you can see the staff working quickly from every seat in the house. Everything is hella cute and red tinged due to old fluorescent signs in the window. Also, they have a massive patio which will definitely be rockin' in the summer.   We sampled the entire menu, like, I'm seriously pretty sure we had at least 90% of it, and these were my faves: fried chicken, sheila salad (radishes and cream, yum!), crack buns (dinner roles served with butter whipped with meat drippings), and slaw. This fried chicken is now my favourite in the city, which is saying a lot, I heart me some Fry Fry Chicki Chick. I washed all of this down with a Clydesdale, which is bourbon and grapefruit and will now be Pepper's Drink for Summer 2013.   *Remember this jam!? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rg3sAb8Id8"}
{"text":"This place was over rated. Our server had attitude and still expected an 18% tip. Lmao. The food wasn't bad but for $8 the beef brisket sandwich was like kids sized. It didn't taste like beef brisket and seemed more like a corned beef sandwich. I was left hungry after eating that small thing. The  $4 corn was alright but I could have gotten a bunch for the same price and it would have been more enjoyable, it wasn't bad but there also wasn't anything great about it. The decoration was interesting and cozy, the dead ostrich kinda weirded me out a tad but it made the place interesting which I liked. The chicken seemed ok, also a tad undersized but tasty. The service sucked we couldn't modify any of our food and we couldn't even split the bill. One of the servers brought my brisket she basically grunted and just dropped the food on the table. I don't know what we did to these people but only one was friendly and that was an old coworker of mine!!! Thanks for making the experience a tad better Cici!!!When we pulled out our debit cards our server gave us weird look. Not sure I'll come back unless it's to see my girl."}
{"text":"After 15 visits I finally got the fried chicken. I liked it! I also had the beef ribs because I personally don't like the pork ones (too dry, overcooked...) they were great. Beergaritas, rib tips, crack rolls, fried chick, BROCOLLI SALAD!"}
