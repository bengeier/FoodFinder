{"text":"Came for a Sunday lunch but they only serve brunch that day. The service, the taste, the choice for ciders is definitely 5-star. 

However, I found the portion really small for brunch. It's a nice place if you already had breakfast and decided to try out some ciders and hang out with your friends. But overall the meal is a bit too expensive for me."}
{"text":"Great selection of on tap cider. Happy to see lots of craft dry cider vs. T sweet mass produced counterparts often sold at the lcbo.

The fried chicken is soaked in buttermilk overnight which keeps it nice and tender. The fried chicken sauce was a cider, pepper and maple syrup reduction that perfectly complimented the chicken. It was so good when dessert came around, I got another bowl of it... please don't judge me :)

Raclette is difficult to find in Toronto here the cheese comes pre melted in a small tray so that you can scoop it onto its veggie accompaniments. It made a nice hearty addition to our meal.

Pumpkin loaf was dry, but quickly sopped up the included bacon infused butter and became instantly moist and flavourful.

Apple cabbage poached egg vegetarian dish left more to be desired for the price but doesn't affect this 5 star review.

Beet salad complimented our carbs nicely. The toasted oats topping it off gave it the texture and a slight smokiness it needed to be memorable.

Spicy apple cheesecake came in a jar. This typically scares me at most places because I imagine a fridge full of mass produced \"pudding\", not the case here -- it was the perfect size and it contained a crusty bottom which obliterated my immature in-jar dessert stereotypes.

Atmosphere was trendy but not showy. Sound carried well and the cold was kept out with both a heavy curtain and double doors -- great job.

Reservations. Yes. Finally a trendy place that is not distrustful of customer commitment. There are too many places in Toronto (ie 416 snack bar and New Orleans) that refuse reservations and prefer a waiting list and line up, this says a lot of good about this cider bar. They trust customers to show up and respect them enough to accept reservations.

Also, we sat for a long time and felt comfortable doing so. Long dinners are a lost art in Toronto, with fixed seating times \"long-sitters\" are frequently asked to leave to accommodate the next party.

Service was great and I didn't hear the Toronto cliche \"how are the first few bites tasting\" within 30 seconds of receiving food and that's great, they left us alone. The only negative I noticed was that a server removed my empty plate while my girlfriend was still eating. Trained servers don't do this.

Great night, great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing place to try new and interesting ciders. It's not just apples, people. 

Custom cider. flights let you try lots of different types that you may not know about. 

I had a flight to try a range and let Heather choose some key drinks. The best one was the shiny peach.  After the flight I had a pint of the Beaver Valley Bumble Berry cider recommended by owner and cider expert Josh. 

I used to think that ciders were limited to just dry grass flavoured cider and rekorderlig... 

Rekorderlig is amazing, and tonight it taught me that there is a world of drinks to try out. 

I will definitely be back to continue my way through the drink menu. Keen to try the food menu too ... Looked amahazing. ."}
{"text":"I did not miss my wine. The ciders were absolutely refreshing . I tried the cider flight of Pinot noir, peach and pineapple, so tasty and was enjoyed with each course. The food was amazing! Fresh ingredients, fabulous presentation., excellent service.  Great  prices. Looking forward to return to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a nice drink and apps on the patio, the cider menu is amazing I tried the sparkling on tap I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"The brunch is to die for! Such yummy selection. The decor and vibe are also lovely. The staff were all very sweet and the cider and cocktails were also great. Very pleased and will come back again for sure :)"}
{"text":"First time here and we were very pleasantly surprised. The menu at least for us, was a little off the wall and the selections we choose were wonderful and full of flavor.  The staff are helpful and explain everything in detail.  The flight of cider for each of us was chosen by our waiter and she was spot on.   We started with the zucchini loaf, deviled egg and seafood salad.  Our main course was the salmon, absolutely to die for.   Loved it."}
{"text":"Hey folks this place is amazing; great cider selection and truly innovative, super tasty menu"}
{"text":"I am from Texas and was visiting Toronto for a week as part of a company outing. Of all the group lunches and dinners that we had during the week  in Toronto, dinner at the Her Father's Cider Bar was the BEST!  Being a beer lover, was kind of new to the Cider scene.We were a group of about 35 and spent an hour on the patio tasting the different ciders before we headed inside for a wonderful 4 course meal paired with ciders to complement the course. Each of the 4 courses was fresh and and tasted wonderful, the best being for me the dish featuring the quinoa which I had substituted for the steak course. Out of the 7 ciders that I tasted that evening, my two favorite ones were the Pineapple Cider and the Thai Ginger cider.

Most in our group voted this place as the best dinner they had during the trip. I highly recommend this place for either an intimate private dining OR for a group(maybe a max of 50). The best food and ciders are complemented by EXCELLENT service and PASSION for what they do!"}
{"text":"We went for the cider, but it's the food that has captured us.  We ordered the cod appetizer - $22, for gorgeous, crispy on the outside and lovely on the inside, cod, served with a subtle cream sauce.  It was exquisite, to put it mildly.  
Because they have just opened we were offered complementary deliciously ocean-fresh oysters.  We also had a flight of 3 ciders which were only $3 each, a bargain.
We ate and drank such beautiful things; a cider that tasted like a mouthful of spring flowers - 'perry-deis', a Tawse cider all lovely and balanced, a ginger flavoured cider too.  
Her Father's Cider Bar has easily over a hundred ciders, 200?  bottled and draught.  
I have to mention the restaurants interior - elegant and hip.
They've got a hit on their hands."}
{"text":"We had a private party in the dining room last night for a birthday. The food was incredible and the service was amazing. Our server remembered everyone's names (our party was around 30 people) and curated individual cider flights when people were unsure of what they wanted. One of my favourite spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"Adorable and gets the job done - my review of a brunch at Her Father's Cider Bar & Kitchen. 

Tucked in on Harbord is this cute resto and bar. Went in on a Saturday morning around noon, and getting a table for seven people was no problemo. As the afternoon went on, the place filled in nicely. 

I started off with a flight of three ciders. One was a classic cider from Twin Pines, one had Thai ginger infused and the other was made with Pinot Noir grapes, giving it a deep red colour. I wasn't expecting to drink at brunch, but once you see the presentation and amazing selection, it is hard to say no! 

For my meal, I had the duck hash with spinach, sunny side up egg, pumpkin seeds and a bechemel sauce. The duck was a little too crispy for my liking, but otherwise a very satisfying first meal of the day. I couldn't finish all the breakfast potatoes that came along with it, and the egg was perfectly fried. Around the table, we had ordered a couple mounds of extra breakfast potatoes that proves to not really be necessary given the portion sizes, but they were still appreciated by the table. 

I'd return to try the dinner and drinks and hell, have another few flights!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a pleasant surprise and stumbled on by pure luck. Staff are very attentive from the moment you sit down to when you're leaving. 

These folks really know their craft cider - try the flights if you don't know where to begin and ask for recommendations. Ciders we liked: bootleg, pinot noir, tawse and blueberry.

The food was exquisite - warm pretzels, buttermilk fried chicken, ricotta gnocchi, and ribeye were delicious. Great for groups. A great place to cap off your week!"}
{"text":"I never knew THIS many types of cider existed! They have some really fun ones on draught. I tried the Thai Ginger, which lived up to its name, and the salted pineapple one is great too! Our server was very knowledgeable and was very patient and helpful in helping us choose from all the options! I also ordered their green soup -- it is like a kale smoothie.. but a soup version. Salty, hearty, and garlicky! It also had some shrimp in it. 

You can also get a flight of ciders (so 3 tasters, which are almost the size of a half pint). I didn't see this option on the menu, so keep this in mind when you order!

The only negative thing that happened for our group was that the person who was at the door didn't want to seat our party until everyone arrived (we were a party of 8)-- the place was pretty empty when this happened.. after she finally seated the first few members of our party, she apparently kept looking over disapprovingly until every person arrived. I can understand if the place was full -- but it was pretty empty. 

Overall, definitely a must-try! The decor of the place is also super cute!"}
{"text":"I was invited to go to this place by a friend of mine and wasn't that enthused initially as I don't know much about cider. However, the cider flight selection, which the waiters helped us pick, plus the truly outstanding first class service has turned me into a big fan! Whoever trains the waiters/waitstaff needs a raise. They go beyond courtesy...they actually anticipated that we would be a little chilly as we were opted to sit at the patio and brought out the heating lamp and then later, blankets!!! They anticipated our every need. 

The patio environment was very pleasant, the cider flights were experimental (for me) and quite interesting, the food was stellar (I had the battered friend chicken - highly recommend it), and service was to die for. This is a place that I will be re-visiting again. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of a cider bar and they have an incredible selection and lovely tasting flights. They also have a delightful little patio on the side and pretty nice service.

What drives me absolutely bananas (pancakes) about brunch in Toronto is this: precious dishes with too much frou frou which actually don't taste like much, are way too small and overpriced. Unfortunately, Her Father's Cider brunch falls into this trap.

Myself and a friend had the $16 Duck Hash which was a bed of spinach, deep-fried duck confit, one egg, sweet potatoes, a small spread of bechamel and a few other bits. Deep-frying the confit left it tasteless and bland (basically salty, crunchy bundles that took away any of the tender, deeply-flavoured joy you usually find in duck confit). The bechamel was hidden at the bottom and while nice, didn't add much flavour to a dish already lacking in it. And the portion was too small - both my female friend and I (who don't tend to eat an absurd amount) felt this way.

The waffle was one waffle quartered with a small scoop of berries and cream for $13. My friend's $14 grain bowl was a bit of a better value but he also ordered a salad (essentially greens with granola on it, but at least it was only $8 - probably the best value on the menu). 

Come for the cider and the service but find your food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and was surprised by how nice it was (Google's preview doesn't do it justice). Atmosphere is really nice and they have a really great selection of ciders. The staff recommended one for me and I really enjoyed it - had to take a photo of it so I'd remember it for later! 

For me it's a bit further north than I'd usually go, but if you're looking for something a bit different and less crowded it's a good spot."}
{"text":"Pleasant and enjoyable experience. My first exposure to non-mass market cider. Food was nice, cider was good, QPR was not bad, service was friendly and cute place. While I might not go back anytime soon, would encourage others to try this place out if in. The area. 

Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Her Father's Cider Bar is too good not to review. I've been here a few times, the latest for drinks with friends on my birthday. They sent out a cake with sparklers, which was lovely! Friends that have joined me here have also gone back because it's such a great place. 

They have a great variety of ciders and the food is great. The staff are very attentive, but not too much so, and are very knowledgeable about the ciders and food. The $12 flight is a great way to try a few things and the staff will also pour tasters if you have questions on specific ciders."}
{"text":"Visited this place for my birthday dinner. Had such a lovely experience. I called for a dinner reservation a few hours before we wanted to come in and they were very accommodating. It might have been the long weekend as it was on the quoted side. The place has a nice decor and the servers are all very sweet and are very good at recommending certain things in the menu. We got the raclette to share, beef lettuce wraps, fried chicken, lamb and blueberry salad. Everything was amazing although the portions are quite small and the meats do not come with any salad or fries you have to order another salad separate. Highly recommend trying this place would come back again and maybe try their brunch menu as well!"}
{"text":"Ciders were delicious and the food was great! My server (I wish I remembered her name) was extremely friendly and very accommodating to me as I was in town alone on business. I ordered a flight of cider, the raclette, the hen, and a cocktail for dessert. I picked the three ciders suggested by my server for the flight and greatly enjoyed each and the diversity that they provided. The raclette might have been the highlight of the meal with an adorable iron plate of cheese warmed by a candle for me to pour over a very unique and perfectly prepared plate of veggies. The hen was delicious, but I will say there was a lot going on - I passed on eating the grilled en dives as I had them with my raclette. The dessert cocktail was also wonderful, but I must say that the of my night was definitely my server's lovely handmade foil swan ;) 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others and would suggest requesting to sit on the patio if it is a nice evening!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a delicious meal and feel all warm and happy inside.  I met my mom here for my birthday - I had never been but was looking forward to it - because yum - cider! I had checked out the menus online (but they were different when we arrived) - everything was great from the moment I walked in.  They took my coat - offered me some delicious cider options - helped my mom pick out something good to eat as well -- and took old school photos with my mom's camera as well.  They even remembered that it was my birthday when my mom made the reservation and brought out 2! free! desserts for us to enjoy (with a candle).  It was great! I loved the food - the customer service and especially the cider! 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Fancy place especially for Friday evening with friends. Book a table beforehand, it could b crowded. Friendly waiters, tasty food and many options of ciders. Good price!"}
{"text":"What an unique addition to the area. This.place focuses on cider and they have a ton of ciders from around the world. They also have ciders on tap for flights. It is just a cool place to come and try something different. Didn't have food, so can't really comment on that."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and made reservations. We had our own room almost with just one other table of 6 with us. Nonetheless the staff were friendly and attentive. Food was pretty good, I was actually surprised because for some reason I was thinking it may not be as good as their ciders. Well...I was definitely proven otherwise which makes this place even better! I got myself a flight of ciders (of course) and they come in 3 glasses. Their selection for ciders are quite vast but they do have more of the popular ones on one main menu. If you aren't too familiar with ciders like me, you can definitely ask for ones that are similar to your taste buds :) my all time favourite right now is the shiny pinot noir as it tastes VERY similar to the rose wine, Beringer White Zinfandel.

Long story short, I am definitely coming back to have more of their food and try some of their other ciders! You should try it out too!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch and wasn't wowed but it was up to par. They specialize in apple cider (clearly) and have over 20 different ciders either on tap or in bottles. I was very impressed by their selection. However, you cannot purchase the bottles as takeout like a store so you only have to choose one :( maybe that would help out these local cider breweries by generating more profit? I don't know how that would work though. I had a hot mulled cider which had very nice presentation and was quite good. 

I had a tuna Benedict which was good as it wasn't the standard salmon but I wasn't wowed by the difference of the flavour? It seemed to fit too well but not enough to wow the tastebuds. The ketchup they served was apple ketchup plus their hot sauce was apple hot sauce but it wasn't very hot :p 

I liked the flower at the table settings, and the tables were clean. I tried a bit of my friend's duck hash and that was good. I don't live in the area so I probably wouldn't be back but I would recommend to anyone who likes cider :)"}
{"text":"I was 100% sure I'd written a review for this place before, but sometimes I'm a bad Yelp Elite and I don't review places I love because I don't want anyone else to know about them.

Highlights: good service, beautiful room, great food, easily accommodate allergies, easy to make reservations.

I still haven't had a chance to have any CIDER at this place, because I'm always there during non-drinking situations, but one day, I will come here and drink all of the ciders!"}
{"text":"Her Father's Cider Bar & Kitchen was surprisingly really really really really REALLY good. I think this place might be \"my favorite bar\" if I do even have a favorite bar? I guess the word I'm looking for is gastropub. Her Father's is super close to U of T, and although the food is slightly more expensive, I think the environment was really great and the staff was super friendly. I was surprised at how beautiful the food was and the bar itself was quite quaint and cozy. 

Me and a couple of guys got in at around 7ish on a Saturday night. It was kind of really packed, but my fault because I didn't make a reservation. We sat on the patio, which was fine with me. Around 9, they accommodated us inside. I guess I would make a reservation next time? 

I got the Her Elder's Flower cocktail and the Blueberry Salad. And both of these food items were BEAUTIFUL. The blueberry salad was gorgeous and it tasted delicious too! I never expected a Blueberry Salad to look SO exciting after the failed salad I got at Harvest Kitchen three days ago (which just so happens to be right across Her Father's) but the plating was great, the dish tasted very blueberry indeed, and the balance of the ricotta was spot on. 

I would for sure come back here to try out some of their entrees next time! I would definitely recommend this place for a date night or a get together with friends. 

TLDR; Cozy and beautiful place with delicious food. BUT, the portions are quite small and the food is a tad expensive."}
{"text":"This review is short and sweet, Nice place, excellent service, good food, and an absolutely amazing selection of ciders. 

I also came for lunch one day and the service was also very good along with the food. They have a simple menu that changes frequently. Great atmosphere and they even have a patio. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Almost everything that we tried was perfect. We shared 4 dishes, each of which was presented nicely and described by the servers. I would highly recommend the lamb tartare, it was one of the best I've had. Cider selection is great and they also serve 3 x 5oz. flights. Service is wonderful and everyone is happy and friendly. We'll be back again during patio weather."}
{"text":"I had no idea there were so many cider options in the world! It feels like just yesterday that cider meant 'Strongbow'. Glad those days are behind us...

The place was very cute and cozy, and the little wine glass flights were adorable. All 3 ciders I tried were quite good, I especially liked the peach one on tap (had \"beaches\" in the name). It was a bit pricier than typical beer pints, but I guess it's not technically beer so who am I to judge appropriate pricing? The alcohol percentages varied as well, from about 5 to around 9 so you could get pretty sloshed without realizing it, as it all just tastes so fantastic! I would definitely go back again to try some more flavours."}
{"text":"A bar that specializes in hard cider??? What I wouldn't give to have this in Columbus.  The menu was very extensive; a dozen different ciders on tap, another dozen or so available by the glass from bottles, and then what looked to be around 100 more of all different kinds of styles, available by the bottle.  I looked at my wife and told her I felt like I had finally found my home bar; I just had to drive around 7 hours to get there.

The place is decent sized, but not huge.  According to their website they can accommodate around 80 guests, but I would have been surprised to get that many in there.  We went the day before New Year's Eve, and even though temperatures were in the single digits (farenheit), the place was still around 80% full.  We sat at the bar, so we could chat up the bartender and find out some more ideas about what we should do and sights we should see.

My wife and I each got two sampler flights, each at $12 for three pours.  The menu was really solid too; I had a bowl of french onion soup, and we also got the raclette cheese platter.  It was pretty cool the way the raclette came out, with the tealight candles under it keeping the cheese gooey enough to shovel off onto the sides that came with it, some red potato wedges, broccoli, mushrooms and a few other sides.  It was fun to eat and very memorable."}
{"text":"Had a flight of cider. Cold crisp and tasty . Great service and patio. Every one should sample the artistry and the effort to put this selection together."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed Her Father's Cider Bar. It was fun and different.

We sampled several of the ciders, and here is a quick summary of our views:
Twin Pines - probably our favourite, good round bodied
Wagner's - not so good, very dry
Pinot Noire - soft, slightly sweeter, the wine taste really helps it . We'd liked this
Thai Ginger - has a nice kick to it, but that's about it
Ernest - very dry, although it is there, the blueberry taste doesn't really come through
Rebel - we found this weird but not pleasant, too much going on
Ducksbury - Smoky, tasted of soap and ammonia. Maybe it was from the glass washing process.

We found the food unusual and interesting.
The Raclette is excellent, good texture and flavour. A fun dish to share. Lots of different raw veggies to dip. The process is a bit hard to manage - the dish is hot!
Veggies on toast was probably the least exciting.
Lobster salad, the lobster was good texture and tasty. Unusual with English mustard. Could have done with more of it!
Our cod arrived cold but nevertheless it was tasty and nicely presented.

The service was excellent, informed and enthusiastic. (Colleen).

I would certainly recommend this as a slightly different place to visit which still maintains high quality."}
{"text":"Booked for drinks with coworkers and have to say, hands down, most stress free experience. I booked online and followed up after since they were closed on Easter Monday. They were very accommodating and took care of our 12+ party very well. Great cider collection and delicious food. Try the pakoras!"}
{"text":"What a surprise! I don't come to Harbord Street neighbourhood that often and recent visit has always turn out wonderful. 

First impression - great ambience and vibe. We came for brunch and it wasn't too busy at 11am. We got sat down at a lovely booth and the sever offered coat check. The food options on the menu is pretty basic, but the drink menu, oh my. As you may have noticed in their name, this place is famous for its cider and they really make it worth it. All the brunch drinks and cocktails have a cider twist and they also have lots of craft ciders to choose from. We had three different ounces and they all turn out to be great. 

We ordered Duck Hash, Yoghurt and Sausages. Absolutely tasty. 

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of cider. The \"prosthetic\" and \"pinot noir\" ciders were wonderful. The \"TP\" /pine cider was really solid.  Beet salad and cheese plates had great flavour.  The buttermilk chicken tasted great by itself, and the spicy dip had a up-your-nose horseradish/wasabi kick.  Fun to alternate between eating the chicken with and without dip.

The place was packed and we didn't have a reservation. Lucky to get a seat for an hour.  Next time we will have to make sure to do so.  Will go back to try more cider and food."}
{"text":"Booked a lunch reservation here since it was near to the hotel of a visiting business colleague from NYC. Great design and yet still quiet enough that we could have a conversation. 16 ciders on tap and our knowledgeable server set us each up with something to our liking - me dry and apple, my guest a sweeter fruit blend. There was a prix fix lunch special which we both enjoyed and both started with an extraordinary mushroom consomme that was almost as beautiful as it was delicious. I followed with a Quinoa bowl topped with grilled halloumi. As gorgeous as the soup and even more delicious. My guest had a mackerel sandwich which he gave two thumbs up.

Lunch can be tricky in the University neighbourhood, so it was pretty quiet on a Friday. It's a great spot and they deserve to be busy.  

I'll be back soon - dinner next time."}
{"text":"I love cider. So already I knew I would love this place. And I was super impressed with both the cider options, the food and the service. We ordered two flight of ciders so we could maximize our cider options. Our waitress took the time to bring us another sample of a cider.

So super impressed as I said and will return. I am hoping the pictures do the food and the ambiance justice!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and cider selection. Will absolutely return and try them again for brunch."}
{"text":"Definitely go for a cider flight, it's so fun to try a few different ones. We got the pretzel with cider cheese sauce, the Korean pork ribs (don't skip these- amazing!!), and the gnocchi which was perfectly sauced and seasoned."}
{"text":"Hesitant to write a review because I don't want others to find out about this gem! Her Father's is already an instant winner and I imagine there will be daily lineups out the door in no time. 

These guys have the largest assortment of ciders I've ever seen. Props for also featuring creative cider-infused cocktails, as well as a selection of beer and wine for the non-cider drinking crowd. Favourite drafts included the Pommies Salted Pineapple (sounds strange, but just try it) and the Shiny Apple avec Pinot Noir.

We ordered some snacks off the menu and everything was delicious, not to mention the stunning presentation. Highlight was definitely the snow crab deviled eggs. The raclette and lobster wraps were fantastic too. 

All of the staff were phenomenal. Our server (Johnny?) was friendly, knowledgeable and incredibly welcoming. We trusted him to choose cider flights for us based on our tastes, and he nailed each of them. He described them all without an ounce of pretentiousness and was just genuinely excited to share his favourites with us. 

A truly wonderful experience, from top to bottom. Cannot wait to come back. I can definitely see myself as a regular here."}
{"text":"Very rarely is there any restaurant or business that truly merits a 5 star rating...but Her Father's Cider Bar definitely deserves it! 

First off, the service was impeccable. It was always kind, courteous, and exceeded expectations. I'm not sure which magical place the wait-staff was hired from/trained, but ALL businesses should follow suit and go on an epic quest to find this wondrous land.

I came with a large group of 15 on a Saturday night, and we were able to secure a beautiful private room at the back of the restaurant for no extra fee, or minimum spending. Surprisingly, they didn't charge an auto-gratuity (but the amazing service definitely warranted a great tip). As a large group, I recognize that it can be difficult for wait-staff to serve us...people are slowly trickling in, socializing and slow to order drinks and food. However, our waiter Jayden/Jaiden was super patient with us, and flitted in and out the room intermittently to take orders or offer drink recommendations. During dinner, food and drinks came promptly, while dishes were taken away efficiently.

DRINKS:
Flight of 3 ($12 - 5oz each): Only the ciders on tap can be chosen for the flights. I tried the \"Perry\" Pear cider, \"Forks Not Spoons\" and the \"Shiny Peach\". Favourites were definitely the Perry and the Peach - both light, crisp and sweet. I didn't love the FnS (tasted a little too potpourri for my liking). 

Dommaine Pinnacle Ice Cider ($11 - 2 oz): This one was very sweet. While it was 12% alcohol, it definitely tasted more like apple juice (dangerous!!!!!)

I also took sips of the pineapple/jalapeno (the jalapeno flavour was definitely not shy), thai ginger (again, ginger flavour was quite prominent), and black cherry (tasted like a sparkling wine). 

FOOD:

Pretzel with cider/cheddar sauce ($4): that cheese sauce was 11/10, would recommend.

Ribeye with spicy butter, kale and pureed sweet potato ($31): The cook was spot on and the meat was tender and flavourful. Absolutely no complaints. (They were out of the striploin that night for some reason, but they subbed it for ribeye)

The menu is seasonal and always changing...thank goodness for that because then it'll just give me more of a reason to come back. Thank you HF!"}
{"text":"Nice concept, so many fun ciders! Jayden our server was excellent and knowledgeable about the ciders. Our water glasses were always full which is always nice. Had the fried chicken and lamb sliders which were also wonderful. The 'cider flight' is a nice way to try the ciders on tap where they give you fairly generous portions of 3 ciders for $12. It's a sit down place where reservations are recommended and they have about 8 spots at the bar as well if you're not going with a huge party. Bathrooms are clean as well."}
{"text":"Amazing cider selection and very knowledgeable staff. Very cool that they bring in local ciders and those from all over the world. I really liked the cornish blush and the pinky noir one. The food was also excellent! Went for brunch and enjoyed the scotch egg with a side of hash. My friends reported the eggs benny was amazing as well, and the homemade sausage (also on the scotch egg) was great. Looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"Tl;Dr: 10/10 would recommend to a large group looking for a good location to have dinner and drinks and/or celebrate. 

I HAVE to start off with compliments for the amazing staff (our waiter Jayden) and customer service. From the moment I made my reservation to the moment I left the restaurant, the service was top notch 100% 5/5. 

I came with a party of 15 because they provided a private room in the back. They did not charge us a booking fee or a minimum spending. We were between the kitchen and pantry, and servers would visit the pantry semi-frequently but we barely noticed them. It was not a problem. I was pleasantly surprised that they did not automatically charge gratuity for our large party (as most places would) but they definitely deserved a hefty tip. As a frugal person, this is the easiest tip I have given. 

The decor of the private room was stunning. It had cute (large Christmas like fairy lights) lights hanging from the ceiling, and had a very chic but rustic feel to it with the wooden furniture. The lights could be dimmed (or not) and there was music playing in the background. 

The staff and restaurant was VERY VERY accommodating to all and any requests (even ones they were not obligated to adhere to). They understood and provided anything we asked for to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. They checked on us and cleared our plate quickly or the next course. 

The menu is an ever changing seasonal menu. They don't have an extensive dinner menu but I think everyone can find something they like there. The portions were not overly big but I'd say they're enough. They have a wide variety of ciders ($9) and many of my friends got a flight of ciders (3 ciders) for $12. I had seared albacore tuna with chick peas, romesco sauce and chorizo. The tuna was cooked medium rare and had a nice sear on the outside. I thought the tuna was a little tough and salty, and the chickpeas were slightly harder than I personally like. The chorizo was very good. 

I can not compliment the staff and their service enough for the wonderful evening my party and I had here. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great location and fantastic vibe. The 4 of us each got the cider flight and it was great. They were all good and we left happy. Thanks Emma for the cider splash and good luck Josh!"}
{"text":"Great food, cider and service. Excellent brunch menu too. Plus gorgeous patio. We had my wife's birthday there. They did an excellent job of accommodating a large group and ensuring that it was a spectacular experience. Highly recommend this place as one of the highlights of Harbord Village."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Her Father's to open since the article I read in early spring. I LOVE ciders and had high expectations for HF. I went there to celebrate my bf's birthday and the staff made us very welcome. The decor and murals were beautiful with sun shining through the stained glass. The bar area has purple lighting which is slightly off-throwing but it works nonetheless.

Kira was our server and she was helpful in explaining the dishes and the different types of ciders. Very sociable! The shareable dishes were perfectly seasoned and plated beautifully, super fresh. We got fried chicken, devil-ed eggs, and the cheese board with crackers. All so soo soooo good. The portions are small but that's why you order many of them! I am already biased at this point and I have no shame in indulging in good food.

The cider samplers IS the it-thing to do as you can choose 3 samplers for $12. Shiny Pinot Noir and County Citrus were my favs! I can't wait to go to LCBO so I can stock up on those two. If you want to check HF out then you must make reservations because you might be on the third page of the waitlist, not kidding.

Recommend 100%, Worth all the hype :)"}
{"text":"My first visit for brunch. We were a group of 8 and they accomodated our reservations which is rare for a brunch spot. They hang your coats which is a nice touch.

The place looks great inside and the food and drink were delicious. I had the duck hash, which was heavy but everything I could have asked for in terms of taste and presentation. The apple cider  (alcoholic or not, looked and tasted great) Service was great and attentive.

I'm not a huge cider fan which is why I've never been before but I'd love to go back for another meal."}
{"text":"As a cider bar, they utilized apples in a lot of their recipes. Like the apple ketchup for the potatoes.

Anyways. Great date place. A bit pricey, but...i want more potatoes. It was good. Their brunch menu was alright. Their lunch menu on weekdays seemed amazing...but i wont have a chance to try it since i dont have any convenient times."}
{"text":"From the ambience to its service to its menu and, what I think is just as important, the cleanliness of their washrooms...I am thoroughly impressed by HF.
I love the atmosphere of this place and I really enjoyed sitting towards the back of the restaurant. Less busy, less people watching but I had a good group of friends to focus on.
Even though we were at the back at of the restaurant, we didn't feel neglected by the server. She was very warm and happy to explain the different flavors of ciders on tap. A flight of ciders for $12 is a great deal. They have also have an extensive menu of ciders in cans & bottles...extensive!
Their food menu, however, was quite the opposite. I opted to go with two appetizers instead of a main. My friends chose either the cod or salmon...I heard no complaints and all plates were polished clean. 
I had the raclette and beef tartare. Loved them both! Raclette served on this mini heated cheese plate, kept the cheese nice & hot til last bite. The beef tartare wasn't mushy which I really enjoyed and had a sauce that resembled wasabi, gave it a little kick.
Overall, great place to check out. I do have to note the attention to detail including its washrooms. It is nice and clean...I was thoroughly impressed!"}
{"text":"This place has got to be my favourite bar this year. If you're a cider fan, this place is a must. The interior is super cozy (great for romantic dates and hanging out with friends), they have an excellent patio for the summertime, and the staff are friendly and helpful at finding you a cider recommendation. There's also a beautiful checkers board with apple shaped pieces that's fun to play!

The cider here is excellent, and there's always great options on draft. Highly recommend the KW Thai Ginger and the Twin Pines HBR for my dry cider peeps. My friends are always a big fan of the Shiny Pinot Noir. If you can't decide, they do flights of everything on draft. Great place to try cider that's not easily accessible at Toronto LCBOs."}
{"text":"Went to enjoy the cider and boy did I! I ordered two taster trays and had the chance to try 6 types of cider from the tap menu. I loved them all but my tables favorite turned out to be the pinot noir. Great taste, and on the sweet side. Others in the group ordered food and loved it. I had the pretzel with coder cheese for $5 and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Our group of 11 came here for a bachelorette dinner a couple of weeks ago. We were impressed that we were offered a private room to celebrate and if the patio was available, we could take the patio. We were impressed until we got there. The private room was a SEMI-private room - we had to share the room with another group. It was so awkward. Also, the door to the kitchen was in the private room so there was a lot of disturbances with waiters walking in and out of the room. We also had a two hour limit for dinning, which wasn't long enough. We took time to enjoy the cider flights, order a bunch of apps and pretty much ordered most items on the menu. We barely had time to take pictures at the end of dinner and the staff had to clear and rearrange our tables already. The food was honestly amazing (like their pakoras, lamb nuggets, fried chicken, raclette to name a few) but this whole arrangement really made the experience subpar for us. Will come back as a smaller group for food because it really was delicious and the atmosphere in the main dining room was great but I think the communication with the staff for booking could have been better. Would not recommend booking the private room if you don't have access to the room for your party only!"}
{"text":"A great concept, a cider bar with people who know their cider like a sommelier knows their wine.

The place is very nice, located in the centre of the city and There are so many cider's on the market today and visiting Her Father's is a great way to taste your way through them. There is a beautiful outdoor patio, which is were we sat for I also like that they have a good selection on tap.

The Spirit Tree Pear is funky, at least that's what the server called it, I think it tastes like feet smell after a couple of hours in the gym.

The West Ave Cherriosity also has a funky nose and you really need to search for the cherry flavour."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! An extensive and diverse cider list accompanying a menu filled with beautiful food makes it easy to have a great night. Service was prompt, knowledgable and attentive."}
{"text":"I hesitate leaving this review.... because Her Father's is the best-kept secret in Toronto.
A few weeks ago I booked a last-minute private event for our organization. The restaurant team were incredibly accommodating, especially with our long list of dietary restrictions and last-last-minute requests.
Everything from the food to the service to the ambience went over extremely well with our guests."}
{"text":"Great night out with three friends. Tried almost everything food item on the menu. Everything was very well presented and well thought out. Fresh and flavourful.   Professional service on a lovely patio. Superb collection of ciders. Everything was great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal, they have some of the best cider I have ever tried!! The food is great as well for both dinner or a snack. The only reason for the 2 stars... is the smell. And by smell I mean a dish they serve ( I believe it's melted cheese) smells like stinky feet! 

I came in a second time with a group of 6 and we were all so excited to try the cider after I've been hyping this place up the whole night. As soon as we walk in there's an odour... it's very hard to describe but it's not good that's for sure, smelly feet perhaps? We were forced to go to another restaurant because the smell was so strong and some of the people from my party felt nauseous! It's so disappointing cause I love the food/cider here.. but I have never encountered a restaurant that smells like that. I say, scratch the smelly cheese all together!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for drinks and were very happy we found this place. We had never been to a cider bar before and loved the curb appeal. We weren't disappointed. 
We sat at the bar. The bartender helped us out and we started with 2 flights of 3 ciders each. We chose from the 12 ciders they have on tap. We ended up trying another two as we enjoyed the flights. 
At the back of the restaurant are several large fridges with their large selection of bottles ciders. 
We'll be back to try out the food as the food going by us to the tables looked and smelt great."}
{"text":"We loved our experience at Her Father's! There are more ciders here than you can count, but the thing to do seems to be to explore the 12 on tap by trying a bunch with friends. A flight of 3 ciders is $12 and they give you a handy little print-out so you remember what you're getting. There were 4 of us so we each got a flight and then tasted numbers 1-12. My favorites were the West Avenue malus humulus and the Shiny pinot noir. The staff are very happy to help you by telling you all about the different options. 

THE FOOD: SO GOOD! We had the raclette (to die for!), the cheeseboard, the fried chicken (yum!), and the blueberry salad. Everything was fresh, delicious, and beautifully presented. Can't wait to go back.

One thing to note, and I'm not 100% sure but it seems to be the case from the website, is that they might not serve food between 1-5:30pm (i.e., they serve lunch for a couple of hours, take a break, and then serve dinner). The place seems to be open basically all day for ciders, though, and closed fully on Mon and Tues."}
{"text":"Love this place. My boyfriend and I had our first date here in the summer, and it was such a fun little place. We had a great time, met some cool friendly people and staff weren't irritable as we kept ducking in and out from the patio to the bar because of the rain.

Food was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Her father's cider bar is just a cute little find with amazing selection of ciders and good food. Staff is very knowledgeable about the ciders they offer and food. 
Absolutely love the cider flights they offer that allows you to pick 3 ciders to sample for ~$12 since it helped me find my favourite cider (the \"blush\").
They also have a patio which will probably be nice in the afternoon but the indoor seating is nice by itself . Will definitely be returning a few more times in the future!"}
{"text":"Service is an easy 5-star here.  Fantastic helpful and friendly staff.  Cool bar, and nice decor.  The bar lights changing colour throughout the dinner was neat but was also a bit distracting.

Had their Spiced Apple Old Fashioned ($14) to start.  Nice strong flavour.  Hit the spot.

Lamb Tartare ($17) and Cheese & Crackers ($15) were the shared starters.  Take it or leave it.  Didn't make a big impact (though a friend said the blue cheese was really good).

Beef Striploin was cooked to perfection, but was a little less than I'd have liked portion wise.  I'd say it was about 2/3 of a full serving.  For the price I'd like to see more.

The cider pairing wasn't really to my liking, but I'm not big into Cider to begin with.  

I'd recommend giving this place a try (doubly so if they up their portion sizes and if you're a cider fan)."}
{"text":"This place is really cool in concept and I like that cider bars are becoming a thing (because I love ciders). 

Food was pricey, but good with tiny portions. The deserts they have are amazing (but I think they change). The raclette was underwhelming and veggies were ridiculously priced (do raclette yourselves if you can, it's tasty and a fun alternative to fondue). The fried asparagus?? were perfectly fried and the Cornish hen was a small portion, everything was good, but not great. 

Now the ciders, the selection is impressive, but with almost 20 ciders on the rotating tap, it would be nice to have full time descriptions, instead of just the waitress giving them orally. I want to say 80% of the coders have that very earthy taste (which reminds me of composer, but to each their own), 10% are very sweet (but still yummy -anything from the shiny cidery is gold), and the lady 10% are good. (Suffice to say that I tried almost the entire rotating tap list). 

Would I go back? Maybe, it's cute with a nice patio. But only for the cider, and even then, maybe not."}
{"text":"Terrific selection of ciders. Great vegetarian food options. Very friendly staff. Not just a novelty concept. They care about good cider. Excellent dinning experience."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Her Father's was for brunch on a Sunday and it's first impression did not disappoint.  Great decor and ambiance, friendly staff, delicious food, yummy cocktails. Touches we appreciated: the heavy drapes over the front entrance to block some of the cold air coming in from outside, the waiter taking our coats, the apple-based condiments, and catering to a gluten sensitivity.  We ordered a couple of cider-based cocktails, one was their version of a mimosa, the other with elderflower, and both were delicious.  I had the breakfast sandwich with potatoes and it was most definitely the best, butteriest, richest, breakie sammie I've ever had.  The potatoes were super crisp and the Thai apple chili sauce I doused them with was amazing.  My boyfriend had the Duck confit, ate as slow as possible to prolong the experience, and had to hold back from licking the plate when he was done.  We didn't order any ciders off the menu, but for those interested, they had a blackboard list of about 12 ciders which probably changes on a weekly or seasonal basis, and an extensive list of bottled ciders from around the world. We'll definitely return again!"}
{"text":"I had the gnocchi and it was superb, along with a delicious cheesecake, and a flight of 3 ciders (sparkling, Pinot noir and pear). Bill came out to $50, not too bad for such a delicious meal. Cute ambiance, every chair has a blanket draped over it. They also have high chairs and do brunch. Will come back!"}
{"text":"They give blankets to hose at the front and a beautiful space for a drink at the bar. There is a small space to buy unique ciders and beers. But wait, there is more!  The back offers a great space for private parties!  
I almost don't want too many people knowing about this hidden gem in the back.  
I had the grain bowl and my only critique would be to add more spinach and mushrooms.  But it was so so excellent. 
And, offer skim milk and sweetener .... but I'm just being picky. 
Love this space.  

Caesars were great!"}
{"text":"Really cool spot. Went with friends last weekend and were super happy with the vibe - very chill, not too loud, good music - great for catching up. 

Huge menu - we started trying a few ciders on tap then tried some of the bottles. Lots of options in the $8/$9 price range, goes up from there. I wished there were more description on the chalkboard of ciders on tap but just a minor complaint, servers helped us out with further info. Overall, the service was very attentive, water glass was always full and serivce was friendly. We only had drinks but food looked good too. 

Will definitely go back here if I'm looking for a spot for drinks in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favourite restaurant.  The management helped me organize a beautiful 23 person event for my wife.  She and the guests were tremendously impressed with the food and the ciders.  The recommendations for both were spot on!  

I was most impressed with the staff including Tim who personally ensured each guest was well catered to.  As an added touch he took the time to learn the pronunciation of my name and say it whenever he addressed me.  

If I could rate this place higher than 5 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon and sat on their really nice patio. We just came for drinks but took a peek at their brunch menu and we'll definitely check it out another time. I'm not usually a big fan of cider but they had a wide variety of selections on draft and I found a few I particularly liked, namely west ave humlus and Thai ginger. We did 2 flights and got to test out 6 different ciders. Service was very helpful. We'll definitely be back to try out the food."}
{"text":"There are few resturant's that are really, utterly surprising: Her Father's is just such a place. Five incredible courses each carefully paired with a different cider to compliment that dishes composition, flavours and textures.

An incredible evening, stunning service and an expert kitchen."}
{"text":"Great little patio with a huge selection of ciders. Went with the cider flight and was impressed with the random as I rarely drink. Wasn't able to make it for brunch but was thoroughly impressed with the sliders and the katsu chicken. Definitely give this spot a shot when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"Incredible menu with every cider imaginable. My friend and I each tried a flight of three ciders which was great value. The patio was so beautiful and comfortable and relaxed and the service was attentive and informative. I would definitely recommend this place and would love to come back to try the food!"}
{"text":"Great space. Great selection of ciders. And very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I've been here before for cider/drinks in the evening and more recently for an event my office organized. The staff were really helpful with organizing and setting up the event and the service throughout the event was great. No complaints. Would go again for dinner/drinks I would consider again for an event."}
{"text":"Very impressed with food and cider. I would highly recommend trying this place. Staff was also very attentive."}
{"text":"Loved all of the ciders we tried. Each one we ordered was perfect for the person ordering it. The food was also very tasty. Our server was lovely and the service was great. Some of the clientele next to us were pretty snobby, but we had fun anyway. We will DEFINITELY have to visit again! This was recommended to me by a friend who frequently visits Toronto and I wasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just had a lovely evening with some friends at this restaurant. As a vegetarian Celiac, I found a variety of innovative things to try.

The Cider selection was excellent! I tried and loved the Thai Ginger one. They have a three-cider-sampler out of a list of 10 different ciders compiled by the restaurant. If you want to venture off the road less travelled, try looking through their extremely long list of various types of cider.

The food was absolutely delicious, with many meatless, wheatless options. I tried the deviled egg (it was one half of an egg), the (I forget their terminology) cheese platter, and a melted cheesey dish with assorted veggies.

I would've given this place 5 stars, but it was pricey for the portions I got. I know their prices reflect the fact that their clearly trying to keep things locally sourced, but I would've been happier getting slightly more food or paying slightly less for what I got.

Overall, great date night! And will highly recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this place is. The variety of ciders is exceptional. The staff and atmosphere are so friendly. The PB and earl grey cake I had in March was the best dessert I may ever have had. I want to go every week, but I shouldn't. 

Fave place!  I'll be going there for my b-day brunch."}
{"text":"Came her a few days ago with some friends, got some drinks and really enjoyed myself. The staff was very friendly and informative about all the different kinds of cider and what they think is good and what this is bad. So I ended up getting a beer, no complaints it was really good and really cold. 

Notes: 
-The beer is a little....JUST A TAD over priced, I know it's a cider bar but if you have beer around for people that don't want cider you shouldn't charge them $9 for a can of side launch wheat beer. Food prices I can understand as the food looked top shelf amazing but come on..Canada + Beer ya know?  
-The lights are really cool and the atmosphere was and comfortable. 
-Once again the staff was SUPER NICE and really made my time enjoyable
-The place was clean and for a small place it wasn't loud at all. 

I hope to return one day and try the food, I recommend everyone to come here and explore the cider and magical menu items."}
{"text":"Her Father's earned my rare and only 5 star for both brunch and dinner.  The care and attention to details by the staff makes this my quintessential and best Toronto neighbourhood restaurant. Dinner excelled beyond brunch.  

Some time ago I came here for a Sunday brunch and was wow'd by the service.  It solidly put itself in the 5 star category on that alone but the decadent french toast made us drool happily Homer style. We came here after making reservations and what happens... the top manager (and possibly co-owner) spots us after talking to the hostess and greets us warmly because he remembered us from that brunch over 4 months ago!!!  

HFCB has a seasonal menu and it changes ... we had the spring menu and I'm already looking forward to the next menu.  It was so hard to focus on the dinner menu as we ready to try their cider flight.   The menu is not large but it's well curated highlighting seasonal vegetables and lots of bold flavours.

Before I start writing non stop about the great flavours, I want to mention why I really liked the service here.  The kitchen can be hit hard a tiny bit if there are a lot of big groups.  This made us wait a little longer for our dessert but as any good service does... they are 100% aware of it and tell you that its happening before it becomes an issue and apologizes for it.  Kudos to smartly managing the situation.  

Cider Flight of Shiny Peach, Shiny Pinot Noir, and Redstone Perry (pear) - For a super reasonable $12, you can try 3 ciders that are on tap and they have a great list.  There is something for everyone.. from dry to sweet. The manager was incredibly helpful to choose the right ones.    5/5

Spring vegetables - best explained as if vegetable tempura and hush puppies had a lovechild with a healthy dose of spices thrown in.  Whoever is frying these knows what they're doing.  They came well seasoned, hot, greaseless, perfectly crispy, and still tender on the inside for the okra and asparagus.  Unlike tempura, these came spiced which had an unique sweet and savoury bold hit in each bite.  Very well done.   5/5

Smokey Tomato soup - A generous, creamy, and highly flavourful bowl of soup that has that softer touch of smokiness but lets the sweet tomato flavour shine along side a subtle heat that builds with each spoonful.  The addition of the finely cubed vegetables added an interesting textural crunch to the super smooth soup.  5/5

Seared Albacore Tuna - A wonderfully plated main of crispy seared tuna with a still cool middle.  I loved how they pan seared it so it got a nice crispy edge instead of typical grill marks.  This dish came with a nice helping of chickpeas, chorizo, peppers, and a big smear of romesco pepper sauce.  You can taste the subtle paprika heat, garlic, and a nice nutty note in the sauce.  Only slight comment would be of the chick peas. It would be interesting to see another side with it and slightly softer (is my preference).  4.5/5

Carrot and Peas - such a simple title for my vegetarian plate!  I had many things on the plate which allowed me to mix into a great flavourful spoonful.  I love how they offer a vegetarian plate that isnt pasta or soy based.  There was peas & snow peas with morel mushrooms and pearl onions, grilled butter lettuce, lentils, a large creamy smear of carrots and a perfectly poached egg that just has its yolk oozing out when cut.  Mixing the carrot, yolk, and tomato jam/sauce created a wonderful sauce coating every vegetable.  I wouldn't mind more of a spicier kick  5/5

PB & Earl Grey - this is a jarred dessert that didn't quite need to be in a jar but was still a cute presentation.  Tender PB cake are cubed up and topped with a cream that seemed to be infused with earl grey tea and added a crunchy sponge toffee.  4.5/5

Lemon curd tart - Shortbread sandwiching creamy, tart, and yet sweet lemon curd with bruleed meringue.  I loved this as it has a lot of great textures (soft, creamy, and crunchy) with amazing citrus flavours.  5/5

This is my favourite Toronto neighbourhood restaurant...  amazing flavours and great personal service that gives you a 5 star experience.  The manager was just awesome and even left us a thoughtful gift that was just perfect finish to a great evening here."}
{"text":"We came here Sunday night so we were seated right away. I really like the ambience and the bar it is really a good place for a date night! So romantic! The staff will help you to decide what to get if you're not familiar with ciders. I got a flight of the sweet ones. They have a wide variety so if you really like ciders you should really visit this place! 

Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the ciders!"}
{"text":"Great service from a knowledgeable waitress, starting with two flights of cider.   Raw oysters came with delicious apple based sauce.   raclette with pickles, mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, broccolini was delicious!   Ribs with kimchi with meat that fell off the bone.   Too many good tastes to list... well worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and long list of ciders! Wonderful for GF! Had incredible GF fried chicken, roasted vegetables and spinach quinoa!"}
{"text":"We came here for some friends' celebration. The cider selection is terrific. The food prices are a little high but the food quality is very good and tasty. I recommend the beef but if you are really hungry don't get the Raclette (too small but I like lots of cheese).  Friendly and highly attentive staff!  Want to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We come here for brunch and dinner. We hosted my birthday party here for thirty people in the private room. Whether at brunch for the two of us or the large party. The food and The service are IMPECCABLE. Thank you for consistently delightful experiences, HFs."}
{"text":"I think I am always thirsty and love to get my intake of calories in liquid form? Her Father's Cider probably the only Cider bar in GTA. And I was impressed with their selections!

Love the $12 Flight Options of any 3 ciders on taps. 

West Avenue Gold 2015 6.9%
Shiny Pinot Noir 9%
KW Thai Ginger 6.7%

All so tasty and easy drinking and refreshing!

They were so good that I ended up drinking them so fast and the next thing I was like a little drunk?! 

Lovely vibe, Friendly staff and even have a west facing patio if you want a lot of sun.

Cannot comment on the food but awesome cider selections. Worth checking out if you love ciders!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last night and had an absolutely lovely time - loved the ambience, the service, and huge selection of delicious ciders! Between two people we got two cider flights ($13/each), so we got to sample 6 different ciders which were all completely different from one another! Our server was so knowledgeable about all the ciders and was able to give us some really solid recommendations based on our preferences. We tried the KW (thai ginger flavour), Redstone (pear cider), Shiny (a cider/pinot noir mix), Shiny (a really sweet one that I think was aged in like a whiskey barrel or something), Collective Arts (honey lavender flavour), and one that tasted like kombucha. My favourite one was Shiny because I prefer sweeter drinks, but I also liked that the cider had layers of flavour - I tasted the apple flavour, but also notes of vanilla and/or caramel. The pear cider, honey lavender, and pinot noir mix were all really good as well. I believe all of the ciders on tap we tried were from Ontario. We also tried an ice cider from Quebec at the end of the night, which was pretty interesting. It was very sweet, but not as much so as an ice wine. 

Besides the ciders on tap, they also had a huge selection of ciders in bottles or cans. The menu was like 5 or 6 pages long! I honestly had no idea there could be so much variety in ciders, so this was a very eye-opening experience for me. I personally prefer ciders more than beer, so this kind of place is right up my alley - I really wish there were more places like this in Toronto! I definitely want to come back and try more ciders, as well as food next time!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife were in from out of town and want to try a cider bar and this place was amazing. We arrived a little after they opened on a Monday and the staff was very courteous and knowledgeable of the ciders that were on tap. The food was very good as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. We had the flight that was $12 for 3 ciders on tap and the food was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Her Father's Cider Bar is a place that knows what it does well and sticks to it.

Without question, the owner (Josh) and his fantastic staff know their cider. There are dozens of options from the local to import, traditional to funky. They can recommend based on preference or on what your food order is and you will not be disapponted.

The menu is simple, short, and local. The quality of the food is excellent and the staff are honest with their recommendations. Particular standouts for me is the fried chicken and the home made gnocchi. 

I have had the pleasure of dealing with Josh and his staff for a private event, team dinner, and a private date and all evenings were enjoyable. I highly recommend a meal or drink here regardless of your passion for cider!"}
{"text":"Great spot with an awesome selection of ciders and food. The cider flights are great and the salads are fantastic. We really enjoyed the Lamb sliders and the pretzel with cheese too! Will be back again."}
{"text":"My husband loves hard cider, like, LOVES.  So when I found Her Father's looking for places to try on our trip I knew I had to take him here.  We came on Friday evening after landing.  It was an easy Uber ride here from our Air B&B downtown.  Once we were sat, we were informed that since it was after 10 pm, the full menu wasn't available, but he showed us our choices.  We ordered the cheese and crackers and a charcuterie. We also ordered a flight of some of the ciders on draft. 

The food, while tasty and beautifully presented, was outrageously expensive for what little you get.  We were actually still a little hungry when we left.  I think if you come here for the cider, and the food is only a snack, you'll be fine.  We came looking for a meal, which was our mistake.  We enjoyed all but one of the ciders. And while the one we didn't like much wasn't horrible, it just wasn't what I was expecting and I wasn't a fan of it.  We had 2 servers that took turns taking care of us were both wonderful and very passionate when talking about the cider offerings. 

The majority of the ciders are by the can/bottle.  Ontario alcohol laws state you can drink there, but you can't take any to go.  Bummer. 

If you're mobility impaired, don't plan on using the restroom.  It's in the basement down a flight of stairs.  

All in all we for sure will be back, after we've had dinner :)"}
{"text":"Ciders and cocktails are so good. The waitress was very helpful and nice.

I wish I could like my dinner too but... Ok, I'm not a meat person but since my fried told me that it's sooo good, I wanted to give it a try and got the beef. I wanted it medium-well cooked and I got it medium rare :(  it's ok, I asked them if they can cook some more and they said ok, they cooked it brought it back but God it was still full of blood. As soon as I stabbed my fork, all my plate was blood. 

I could only eat the sides which were reaaaally good. The salad with apple chutney is amazing. Definitely go there but if you don't like meat bloody, don't get the beef"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!?

The grain bowl and the Eggs Benedict were very tasty! I especially liked the eggs Benedict because the Thuet English muffin they made tasted really good! I didn't try the duck hash but that would be the other option I would recommend since it's not a brunch option you find a lot at other restaurants!

I really think this restaurant is a hidden gem. The place looks very cozy and I liked the classy look with the velvet blue sofas and the cute chairs. They specialize in ciders on tap so this makes this restobar very unique. I would come back for the dinner if I have a chance!

I also really liked the grain bowl too. I liked the color combination and hence the presentation of the bowl. Like Early bird, the bowl had quinoa mixed with mushrooms sitting on top a spread of hemp. Add to that, the crunch of fresh spinach leaves and walnut bits, topped with two poached eggs! Great for those who are looking for a vegetarian option and something light to start your morning. 

The Thuet English muffin tastes like a tea biscuit but it's not as thick as a tea biscuit. I liked that it was crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Whether you choose the vegetarian option or the trout option, they're both good options to go with if you like eggs Benedict. The eggs are soft poach eggs with a little bit runny on the inside, just perfect! 

If you like apple ciders, but don't want alcohol in the morning, try their warm apple cider. Plenty of apple flavor on a cold morning, this drink will warm you up!

You might wonder where her fathers cider comes from. It comes with the history of the restaurant spot the owner picked. When he ripped out the carpet, he found out that the restaurant spot had a history associated with the name her father. 

LAST TIP?!

For brunch, they take reservations!! That's a plus on its own. You can also host parties here for an intimate experience with your friends and family up to 80 guests. Take advantage of their apple fennel ketchup, made in house, different from the regular ketchup!"}

I read great reviews about this place and decided to check it out with 2 of my friends. We came for an early dinner around 6 so the restaurant was pretty empty. It started to fill up later into the night. Atmosphere was good for dates, friends, and we saw a bigger group here for a birthday. I appreciate that the restaurant wasn't so loud that I can't hear my friends.

I started with the hot apple cider and had the smoked Gouda and potato soup and the lamb sliders. Everything was delicious other than a piece of rubber band I found in the soup. I talked to the server about it and they handled it nicely. 

I didnt get a chance to try their ciders but would definitely come back to try them!"}
{"text":"Came at around 11pm on a Saturday night and place was pretty empty so we were sat right away. The server came over and explained to us what was available on the menu and the option to do a \"cider flight\" (3 5oz servings of different ciders for $12) After about 5 minutes she came over and asked if we needed any help deciding which ciders to get for the flight. She then described every cider that was offered on tap. She told us about the different flavours and notes. She was extremely knowledgeable and i was impressed. After we made our choices she punched in the order and the cider was at our table within 5 minutes. The flight was an interesting experience and I'd recommend you try it especially if your not sure which one you'll like.  With our ciders we also ordered the kaarage chicken and cauliflower pakoras both were delicious and complimented the ciders. The service here was fantastic and everyone is super helpful and attentive. Definitely give this place a try you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"3.5-4 so 3.75? overall extensive selection of ciders. Many Canadian ones too whoo hoo. Did not have Turning Point cider though which is hard to find. 
I think they had a spicy one Thornbury? Not sure - in the winter. Too bad they did not have that one - sooooo good! 
Their on tap selections change every so often. 
One of the ciders as described was supposed to be sweet but was soooo NOT sweet - some sangria one. Do not get that if you want sweet. Boo on the description. 
The peach was the best from our selection. 
Pretzel was ok, we were half and half on that one. Same with the fried chicken - nicely done and juicy - but all the flavor was in the side sauce - not much on the batter. 

The best - which I would def come back for was the potato salad with mackerel. I was hesitant with the name because I thought it was the usual mushy potato salad, but it was cut mini potatoes all roasted nicely with flavors of smoked mackerel, orange, pesto, pickled onions, dill - who would of thought?! But the flavors pop amazingly together - so delicious!
I know they change their menu so often but this dish is a keeper!

Friendly staff and nice decor, good small corner patio, though the raclette that other tables had was quite offensively stinky. I guess thats how that cheese is though. Surprised its on the menu when it can negatively affect those around the table eating it while the table itself enjoys it haha."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Got seated in the back which was more private but was nice as we were a group of 7 trying to catch up. Lighting was dim but they had string lights hanging which made me feel a tiny bit like i was outdoors. Very friendly and efficient service. Orders were taken and everything came out in a timely manner considering they were pretty busy.

I got the cider flight for only $12! Probably the cheapest thing there and really enjoyed being able to pick my own 3 flavors as I'm used to just being given whatever when i order a sampler. The only one I didn't like was the peach, reminded me of cough syrup. The menu is small and a bit pricey for the apps but the mains are normal. The dish i got was soo good. The cod was a good size and cooked perfectly. The mussels were already taken out of shell so all you have to do is eat! I just wish i had bread or something to soak up all that yummy sauce that went to waste. I would totally eat that cod dish again today! I would definitely recommend this place to try."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved it.

Took my fiancée on a drinking through Toronto you and made this one of our stops. 

We sat on their gorgeous patio area but even walking though the interior we were impressed. Their huge glass faced refrigerators filled with cans and bottles of all shapes and colors was impressive and a stylistic choice that is sure to wow anyone.

Outdoors we still received amazing service and I was glad to see it wasn't just one server with ALL the tables outside like it can sometimes be in smaller venues.

And to get to the business... cider was great! Lots of different styles and flavors and colors and textures. I had cider that tasted like wine, cider that tasted like fresh alcoholic apple juice, cider that tasted like beer, cider that tasted bitter and sweet and crisp...

It's the Willy Wonkas cider factory here and the flights are awesome.

Give this place your business. No doubt about it, this place will be the.... apple of your eye.....

{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, great service, good food, tons of cider, and eclectic music = great night! We were a party of 6 that came for a bday a we made reservations before hand and were seated at the back area which is super cute with the hanging lights and it's brighter and quieter than the front area. Our group were a bunch of late 20s to early 40s and we arrived early to a lot of family with young children eating but it worked for them, for us and even for older crowds: Quote from another guest \"this is a place I would bring my mom when she visits from England\". The cider selection is great and the server is very good at explaining all of them and making recommendations. The daily bread sounds bland but uh if its the cider bread GET IT ITS SOOOO GOOD. I was confused about the bone marrow I ordered because it wasn't a bone marrow it was some veggies on bread that was cooked in bone marrow? That was the only disappointment. The main of Tuna was pretty good but the cod was better. Cheese plate was small but tasty. Overall a very great place highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Has taken me far too long to write this review but here goes...

Had a fantastic experience at Her Fathers. It was my intro to the world of cider for me as I've only had a few varieties in the past. I was blown away by the cider flights, the food and the prices (read: reasonable). The service was impeccable. Stand outs were the raclette, the charcuterie and the main proteins. A beautiful atmosphere - left happy and satiated :D I wish this new restaurant all the luck in the world - give it a try and see what you think!"}
