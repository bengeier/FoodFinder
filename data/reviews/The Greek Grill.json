{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the lemon chicken and potato dish. Healthy portion at a reasonable price. Service was quick and wait staff was courteous. Great alternative to Danforth restaurants. Visit on a night when they have roasted lamb on the rotisserie - super good!"}
{"text":"Been there  3 or 4 times in the past year. The food is quite good. Like the lemon chicken soup. Cant remember the Greek name.  Waiters: i have had two different ones Waiter number one no personality  runs around and quite abrupt. I felt as though i was being rushed. I wont go on any more you can get the idea. Waiter number two No personality as well. Few of us at the table and asked for lemon for water and he only brought two slices. Salad came with meal and he didnt bring it. I had to ask. Needed more water and we were never asked if we wanted more. Made to feel that we were bothering him.  Whats the problem with finding servers just a bit more pleasant ..this would at least make up for the lack of great service."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight and disappointed with the results. The food was warm at best when I got it home so not a good start. The chicken souvlaki pieces were small and dry, the pork souvlaki pieces were similar but also a little too fatty for my taste. The roasted potatoes and rice were average but could have been more favorable.  The accompanying buns were not worth the effort, should have ordered the pita bread.  Overall not a good takeout experience."}
{"text":"Chicken souvlaki is dry. Fried calamari taste like they come out of a box of pre breaded seasoned frozen calamari. Salad is lacking dressing. The lemon potatoes and rice are amazing. To sum it up ....only come for the potatoes and rice"}
{"text":"Actually a solid 4.5 stars.  I'm not Greek, so can't speak to authenticity.  But the food is delicious, plentiful, and excellent value.  The $12 fried calamari appetizer is the size of many restaurants' entree portion, and is tasty and not oily at all. The $6 tarama starter is easily double the amount you'd expect, and came with plenty of pita and toasted garlic bun to put it on. The two together is enough for two moderately-hungry people to enjoy.    I had the pork gyro, which is lovely shards of flavorful pork, not the processed \"loaf\" gyro I usually see (and, to be honest, love).  Served with two sides (in my case, rice and lemon potatoes), a crisp, fresh Greek salad, and plenty of tzatziki, it was piled high for just $12.   My dinner companion had the chicken souvlaki, which was very good, but not exceptional.  If you like a typical souvlaki, you'll like this.  At $12, it seemed like the lowest value for the money - about a dozen inch-square cubes, plus the sides. Not a BAD value, but less impressive than the other items.   All in all, our bill, including two cans of pop and tax was about $50. That got us enough to thoroughly fill up three hungry people. I consider that a good deal for plenty of fresh-made, delicious food!    The half-star off is relative, simply because calling it \"perfect\" wouldn't be accurate. The tap water they provide smells like a swimming pool - the chlorine odor is startling.  They were out of a few of the items we'd initially planned to order, and the server was pretty brusque about it. Small things, for sure, so take them as you will.  I still recommend Greek Grill, and will definitely be going back.  And probably order delivery, too."}
{"text":"Having lived near Greek Town for many years, I have eaten in most restaurants on the \"strip\". However, I keep coming back to the Greek Grill because not only am I always welcomed by the owner and/or staff like an old friend but I enjoy their menu & service. They are also prepared to adjust a specific dish to my personal taste. i.e. way back when they were a Mr.Greek they had a Roast Lamb with a Mediterranean style Pasta on the menu. Even though this dish is now not on the regular menu, they still prepare it when requested and with a side Greek salad and a small bottle of Retsina -the white aromatic Greek wine- I dine like a Greek God. They have a side-walk patio for those warm Summer evenings and it is located a short walk west of the Pape TTC subway station. Also they are open into the wee small hours i.e. after Midnight"}
{"text":"Our first time at this restaurant and really did not have any expectations.  If you were to order one thing in this restaurant, order the grilled calamari.  It blew me away and set the stage for the rest of the food.  We wound up having 5 or 6 more dishes and staying for over 2 hours.  I would definitely return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"One of the best places to have Greek food , great taste , great value for money, real home made taste Greek food , servers are nice and there is a family atmosphere during day! They have fast delivery and takeout."}
{"text":"I've been to this amazing Greek Resturant few times now ! I should first start by saying that the service has been wonderful since day 1 ! I tried their braised lamb , chicken souvlaki/ gyros and their rotisserie chicken ! The food quality and portion are both satisfying ! The food is very much tasty ! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten in the restaurant but, had delivery tonight and it was amazing!!  We live close but didn't expect our food to arrive in only 1/2 an hour. We ordered the pork souvlaki (LG), chicken souvlaki (reg size) and the pork gyros (LG) for appetizers we ordered calamari and tzatziki w pita.  All of it was absolutely delicious and I've never been a fan of calamari but my hubby ordered it and YUM! The tzatziki came with a huge bag of toasted pita. The entrees came with rice, potato, salad and garlic bread. I really liked that the salads were packaged separately, as often it's all together and your rice tastes like salad dressing. I tried all the meats and they were excellent. My 3 year old loved it and a lot of her meal, my 7 month old really enjoyed rice from my plate. It was perhaps a little pricey I thought when told the order total, but the quality, service and packaging made it all worth it. (I didn't know the hubby ordered calamari until the food arrived!)  Because it is so close to us I can see it becoming a date spot for us since we can walk there and be home quickly for the babysitter. .... As I've been writing this I keep going back to the table for another piece of pita and tzatziki! The tzatziki by the way is thick, but I think it's much better than what I've tried in other places, from \"Mr. Greek\" to many restaurants along the Danforth."}
{"text":"Living close to Danforth we have been to different Greek restaurants, they  are not very vegetarian friendly, but luckily there are few options we have been able to choose from, bit nothing mind-blowing so far. Visit to Greek Grill turned the things positively upside-down for us, as from now on we will keep going to that place, as the food was heavenly.  Mid-busy (two other tables occupied) on a Tuesday dinner time we were welcomed by an amazing server (owner?) and two ice-waters were served in an instant. We were excited to order Veggie Stuffed Eggplant $12,  but it wasn't on that night as a daily special. So we settled for hot appetizer of Garlic Shrimp Dinner $9 and we weren't sure what to have as a main vegetarian dish. Asked server, who was a bit stiff and seems like a guy who never smiles, for options and we were offered a vegetarian plate, which was enough to share between two people. Mind me, when writing this I am drooling, as the food which came in moderate time was VERY delicious.   The plate, which included Side Rice, Side Lemon Roasted Potatoes, Side Vegetables (cauliflower, zucchini, broccoli) and Side Orzo Pasta came with Tzatziki sauce, a bowl of Greek Salad, which was indeed as oily as one of the reviewers mentioned earlier, but we sucked it with another side, freshly grilled bread pieces and were very satisfied. Shrimps were great and the oil infused with garlic were a true gourmet meal to enjoy.  Food was hot, tasty and beautifully presented. An experience which definitely needs a following visit. The kind guy checked on us and glasses were filled with water when they were getting emptier. Service was good, place was warm and comfortable.   We were too full to eat a dessert (not in the menu), so we ordered custard pie to go $5 and enjoyed it at home later with tea. Have had better pie than that though.  The best Greek food we have had."}
{"text":"Shabby looking but great food and great service. Our server was very friendly accommodating. My hubby couldn't decide between the sides so our server offered to give him a little of all the ones he wanted to try. They didn't charge us extra and my hubby never had to ask.   Portions were generous and food tastes great. Tamara dip was too salty but I've never had it before so maybe it's supposed to be? The grilled pork was a little dry but the flavour was good. Moussaka was very yummy. Side Greek salad was nothing special but decent.  I'd go back again to try the souvlaki, and have the moussaka again.   Eating leftovers for lunch right now and I don't know how the pork has become more moist.. weird."}
{"text":"Went over with some friends the other night and we were not happy. Waiters were confused and food and plates were falling all around us. Food was so bad I felt like leaving , very bad when they are busy. Note, go when they are slow because they cant handle the busy times. Like we say in the business, they were in the WEEDS. Waste of 80 dollars."}
{"text":"I go by this place all the time and have always wanted to go in. Yesterday was the day! And it was great. I had a classic chicken souvlaki and my partner had grilled octopus. Both dishes were big, and the food was a delicious, at a great price! Our server was an older guy, not super friendly but was fast and prompt with our meals and taking our plates away.  I'll be back to the Greek grill soon. :)"}
{"text":"While it is a bit off the Danforth and with a small diner feel, it has some the best and most authentic Greek food in the city. I highly recommend the pork Kontosouvli (Rotisserie). I have not had better outside of Greece. Their daily oven made meals are just as you would get in Greece. The people and service are both fantastic, hard working and kind."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Greek places on the Danforth, worth the trip north for anybody looking for well priced authentic delicious food.  We make this a staple of our take-out routine, and often will order just the Tzatziki, $5 and worth every penny.  staff always seem polite."}
{"text":"A great place to score some Greek take-out.   Half the enjoyment is waiting for your order, watching the boisterous owner make the rounds, greeting regular customers.  The other half is the food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek restaurant in Toronto. If you want authentic Greek food, you need to go here. Try the kontosouvli. And service is quick, friendly, and helpful."}
{"text":"Driven past many times and the car park is always fun. Went here with my mom n dad as they had been before and recommend it. It's pretty far off the beaten path of all the other Greek spots but didn't disappoint. The joint was bustling with patrons and busy staff. They served up traditional fare, some of which I've never come across on the main Greek stretch. I opted for the gyros while mom n dad got the roast pork special. Started with the grilled octopus which was fantastic. The gyros was unlike any other I've had. Not the usual processed ground and formed meat on a block that I'm used to, but rather nice pieces of seasoned pork. My parents roast bbq pork was out of this world. It must only have been slow roast all day because I was oh so tender having the consistency of warm butter. Delicious. All that accompanied by tasty sides of roasted Greek potatoes, Greek salad, garlic bread and Briam(stewed zucchini), yum! Portions are massive, and that's coming from someone with a big appetite. The price point, exceptional value for money. Can't wait to come back for patio season and more of that grilled octopus."}
{"text":"This restaurant was okay. If you don't have any food allergies this restaurant is a great choice for authentic Greek food. As someone who is both lactose and gluten intolerant, I could only eat one of two dishes found in the menu.  All of the side dishes have a chicken powder in them, which contains a gluten flour. This was really disappointing. I asked the waiter if they could make some of the items without the chicken powder and he told me everything was already mixed together.  I had to beg him to please grill me some vegetables. He finally agreed after some time.   The steak that I ordered didn't have much flavour.  I'm sure the normal steak is flavourful but they had to serve it plain since the sauce also contained gluten.  My friends dishes looked really good. They enjoyed some of the appetizers including the famous cheese that they light on fire. It looked fabulous and they all said it was great!  I believe their meals were really good too.  This place was super busy with people dining in and residents stopping in for takeout. If you like authentic Greek food and don't have any food allergies, this restaurant is for you!  It also has a nice family atmosphere. Everyone claps after they sing happy birthday at any of the tables and everyone in the restaurant says, \"Opa\" when they light the cheese on fire."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here. Delivery was extremely fast and the food was hot and fresh when it arrived. The meal was really good! Large portion at a very reasonable price. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Really good, authentic, Greek place that makes for a great outing thanks to an excellent friendly staff.  This place actually has real Greek dishes you'd find in a Greek home such as, orzo pasta, pasticcio, Gemista, etc.  if you want  authentic Greek food and not tourist food then check the place out."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery it was fabulous fast and very fresh! The Tarama was  one of the best I've ever had! Definitely a new go to place for us!!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!!! Good authentic Greek food. I've tried the usual souvlaki, as well as the Greek Lasagna, stuffed peppers and I can honestly say this is a hidden gem away from the Greek Town/ Danforth. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious family style danforth foodd. Great for sit down and take out. Love the souvlaki dinners (all good), grilled veggie side, and orzo pasta. Sides I've only tried the grill octopus and it was tender and delicious. Other yelpers seem to like the dips. So will try that next! Portions are generous.   I think this place is actually family run. You'll hear some bickering etc. But it's part of the experience lol. The servers are stretched thin.. so they rush but get you what you need. Limited parking up front but lots of small streets near by."}
{"text":"Solid greek dishes for affordable prices. Really enjoy the pork and chicken gyro and they make amazing fried calamari. Don't have to deal with paying for parking like you do with all the other greek restaurants on the Danforth which is very nice. Highly recommended but I notice the service is best before peak hours/on weekends as it can get a bit crowded with the locals."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's nothing great and overpriced.  1 star for staff/service. They're always curt and rude. The music is too loud and of you ask them to turn it down they look like you're insulting their only child and tell you they can't/won't turn it down. There are two hard of hearing people I go with, and it's often a nightmare to talk.  My friends and I go every few weeks, not cause we like it, but because there is nothing else in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place I used to be a Danforth Ave Guy but a friend brought me and my wife here last year and it was amazing the people are very polite treat you as one of the family and the food is so good I never once considered putting ketchup on it  I seriously never tasted Greek food with such wonderful individual flavors that complement one another as perfect as I have here. The portions are very generous and the atmosphere genuine , it lets you feel as if your someplace else . This is our fourth time here and worth letting the Yelp community know about that's why I'm posting this review now! Well worth the trip. Great people ,great atmosphere ,and amazing food! I give this place 3 talons up Cheers Falcon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for great prices. Service is exceptional. The food is authentic, and delicious. I come from whitby to eat here."}
{"text":"We have driven past this place countless times and this time I asked my husband how he felt about stopping and dropping in for a bite.  Did not expect to see the crowd, the place was packed.  We were fortunate to get the very last available table without a wait.  There was a line a short time later.  We noticed that many of our fellow diners were speaking Greek.   This must be a good sign.  We both had the chicken souvlaki, lemon roasted potatoes and lima beans, with an order of briam to share.  We upgraded to the village salad.  Everything that was served to us was delicious.  The chicken was beautifully seasoned, moist and tender.   It might just be the best tzatziki I have ever had in a restaurant.    My husband, who is Greek, loved the beans.  The briam was amazing mix of roasted zucchini, peppers, onions and thinly sliced potatoes in a beautiful tomato and olive oil dressing.  Absolutely not heavy handed with the salt, just the right amount.  The potatoes were roasted, not braised in some soupy sauce.    The complimentary garlic bread was fresh, it was a soft crust, but as previously stated, it was free, so not complaining, we ate 2 baskets of it.  We once went to Paralia and they charged us $15 for a basket of toasted pita(2 whole pitas cut up into 12 pieces).  Will never get over this.  We both had a glass of the house wine.    All in all, a very much enjoyed dinner, with wine, for under $50.  Service was friendly and fast.  Very fast.    Will bring friends and family next time."}
{"text":"Opa-licious. Good service. Good traditional Greek fare. And they light up the Saganaki flare...even on Sundays."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and great greek food for a good price. My go to place. Big bonus is the free parking!"}
{"text":"Awesome local food. Essentially, you are getting pretty decent greek food here. The Calamari was light, chewy and not greasy.  Salad was fine too. Decent size portions as well, so good value for money.  Busy operation, and family run.  Now, the only troubling issue is the annoying fruit flies hovering around you when you are eating dinner.  When we were seated my friend asked the waiter to bring a fly swatter; and if I go back, I will bring my heavy duty electric one...  Good value for money."}
{"text":"I have only been ever had delivery from here but it is great food!  Everything I've tried has been very good, hot and promptly delivered. No need to go anywhere else for great Greek delivery! I really should try eating in one of these days!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten here but just watched the video someone posted. And I have to ask - why do people in the food industry even bother to wear gloves if they don't use them correctly (i.e. holding the skewer with a gloved hand while handling raw meat with ungloved hand)? That is rhetorical, by the way."}
{"text":"OH. MY. BIG. FAT. GREEK. WEDDING.  The Greek Grill is FAN-Tsatziki-TIC!   Seriously, this is the most wonderful tzatziki I have ever tasted. Mr. Rosie S. agrees.   We ordered catering for dinner after rehearsals. They delivered to the rehearsal hall downtown (Queen & Yonge) and everything was hot and delicious, even after sitting for 15 minutes after being delivered.   *Round of Applause*  We had: - Tzatziki - Hummus - Village Salad - SO MUCH PITA - Chicken Souvlaki Sticks - Pork Gyros - RICE GALORE - Lemon Roasted Potatoes  *burp*  Everyone loved it. I will dream of this tzatziki for life."}
{"text":"Living near the Danforth I have so many options for Greek food, but somehow I always end up back here. The food is delicious. You get huge plates for your money no matter what you order. They even deliver and have take out, which is a rarity. The decor is a little cheesy, but nice. They have a big fountain in the middle of the resturant and the tables are a little too small for the amount of food you are going to get. The servers aren't overly friendly, but they are attentive enough. They do have a nice patio on the Danforth, which is great in the summer."}
{"text":"I really, really, really, wanted to give this place more than 3 stars.  The saganaki was one of the best I've ever tasted.  The service was wonderful.  Price point is great.  But, I ordered the pork gyro dinner that came with 2 sides (I chose french fries, but I should have gone with the roasted potatoes and rice) and a greek salad.  The pork gyro meat was dry and cut into little tiny bite sized bits.  The tzatziki lacked cucumber and was of a very thick consistency which I didn't care for.  And the worst part of the entire meal was all the little fruit flies that were hovering above our table/food.  Last thing I want to do while I'm eating is batting around fruit flies and regular flies from sitting on my meal, because then it leads me to believe that there has got to be flies roaming around in the kitchen, which then leads me into thinking how many flies have already sat on my food before making it to the table, etc. etc.  You catch my drift.  What really looked good here were the braised meats.  I will try this place again when I hunker for Greek food again, but will order the braised meats and bring along my fly swatter."}
{"text":"The best chicken souvlaki and priced well.   Juicy and properly marinaded. Traditional Greek atmosphere and very clean."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek restaurant at the north edge of Greektown!  Not well known in Toronto, but it should be, and the locals and greeks from around the GTA take advantage of the fact and the large parking lot is always full.  Since I am originally from south eastern europe, I took my parents here as they do not recognize any other cuisines except Greek/Turkish/Macedonian/Albanian/Bulgarian/Serbian and they have zero interest in experimenting or even giving a chance to anything outside that bubble (I know, I tried - only frustrations).   The souvlaki was large and well done (pork, of course! like back home), and we had it with fasoules and baked potatoes, as it should be eaten (no one eats rice back home).  Large portions filled them up and they very very happy (especially since I tried to introduce them to Vietnamese the previous day and couldn't hear the end of the complaints).   Service was Balkan-style, so if that's not your cup of tea, you might have a problem, but I like it. All servers were middle-aged men, again, Balkan-style.   Have in mind that in the Balkans EVERYTHING is cooked very WELL-DONE!  Yes, it might taste a bit dry, but that's the way they like it.  My mother was going to have a heart attack when I took her to a steakhouse and her steak was a bit pink in the middle (she called it \"almost still alive\" :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a terrific addition to the neighbourhood. I have seen many places come and go in the exact spot but I think this one is meant to last. Great food, great waitstaff, fast takeout, reasonable prices. Yum.   Edit: I'm deducting a star cause there's this elderly jerk that's always there, and when I was there he was blatantly laughing and saying rude things to his coworkers. Everyone else there is terrific, except this old jerk"}
{"text":"It gets very busy every day as it is a small place. Service was really good and the food is really good for a reasonable price. $13 for a gyros dinner plate is a very good deal considering you get a good portion. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch/early dinner and sat in. It was fairy busy but mainly was because lots of people were ordering and picking up take out. Layout is pretty small and kitchen and bar is sort of open concept.   I ordered a large village salad with chicken. Portion of it was huge! I didn't get to finish it all. My partner got the moussaka with a side of potatoes, rice and salad. Our orders came with complementary garlic bread which was nice. My salad was very tasty and they were not stingy with the feta at all. The moussaka was extremely delicious and so creamy. Perfection!   Staff is extremely friendly and I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Small place. Very simple interior. Looks a bit like a breakfast diner inside. Patio is very pleasant. Stopped to have a quick bite in the middle of the day but stayed till 5pm drinking red wine and eating Veal. Great food! Marking it with a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Decor & Setup: 4/5  Once again, GREAT Greek food! Had multiple items so can't go wrong there! Service was above average. Good pricing. The environment was nice, up beat, and people seemed to enjoy themselves.  The decor was real nice.  One of the better ones I've seen compared to other Greek restaurants.  Most def be back here when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - can a vegetarian really appreciate a Greek restaurant?  Methinks not, but this one tried.  I popped in here with my mum this week for lunch.  The Decor? Pure cheese but I was fine with that.  It was a little tricky to order for myself being a vegetarian, altho my mum wasn't terribly impressed either.  Service was attentive.  The appetizers we had were pretty good - Hummus with toasted pita, and the flaming cheese.  They each get a star :)  My mum had a lunch special of the calamari, fries and salad.  All three were fine, but absolutely nothing to write home about.  The calamari was a bit chewy for my tastes.  The fries tasted a bit ..... calamari-ish as well.  I had the salad (a version of Greek without the lettuce) and here is where major pointage was lost.  There was about half an inch of oil poured over the whole thing, and so for every bite I had to lift my vegetable out of the bowl, and wait for the oil to slide off.  To make matters worse, I also had to salt the tomatoes since slathering them in low quality EVOO doesn't really add to them.  The salad was gross. Seriously.  Other people around me who had the souvlaki plates looked like they were enjoying them, so I wouldn't rule this place out - but I personally will not come back here because even the salad was too oily for me!"}
{"text":"Came here for weekend lunch. The service was fast and friendly and the patio was nice and large so lots of spaces to be seated.   We ordered a pork soulvaki plate ($10)with rice, fries and side salad,  along with kalamari (8). The food was okay. Pork was quite fatty, a bit too salty and a bit overcooked. Salad was super oily but there was lots of crumbled feta which was tasty. The kalamari came in a huge portion but could be fried more crispy. The flavour was wonderful and the kalamari came out really tender."}
{"text":"We found this place because of Yelp, let me tell you that it was a fantastic find! We arrived there at around 10pm, we asked if they were still serving which the excellent server promptly asked and the cook confirmed they still were. Within minutes we were ordering and when our server came, he gave us suggestions in what to get and treated us as family, another few minutes and we had our meals which were a chicken and pork souvlaki plates.   It was the most delicious home style cooked Greek meal we have ever had. The Tzatziki was thick, delicious and authentic. The meats were perfectly seasoned and cooked. The rice and potatoes were amazing and the vegetables were incredibly delicious.   I would highly recommend you check this place out, it has a real Greek feeling with lots of locals coming in for drinks, laughing, talking and everyone is in a great mood. I would definitely go back and plan on to next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"If you're wanting classic Greek dishes, check out the Greek Grill.  Unlike the other establishments on the Danforth, there's parking on site so that's one less stress when going out to eat.  The dining companions and I came in as they were ready to close; in spite of this, they let us in because there were still patrons finishing up their meals. Service was pretty good; our waters were refilled right away and they were very generous with the garlic bread.  I had the chicken gyro on a pita - the chicken was nicely seasoned! I enjoyed my meal here.  Pricing here is pretty reasonable; 2 chicken gyro pitas and 1 souvlaki dinner (all of which were quite generous in portion) was under $30.  Good for: quick bite, cheap eat, casual meal"}
{"text":"The star rating on this place was right on. I ordered a standard Chicken Breast Grilled with a side salad. The salad dressing was I could tell it was house made & was very good. The chicken was a dry as a bone with little taste. It also came with a side bread which I didn't eat.   What bothered me about this place was I overheard one of the waiters/kitchen staff making fun of a customer!! The customer had a legit question in my mind. As far as I'm concerned...this should have NEVER of been spoken within ear shot of other customers!! Huge No-No! If I heard them talking smack about one customer what would stop them from saying the same about me?? I have them 2* for this & the dry chicken."}
{"text":"Good wine, good food, quick service!  Casual diner style restaurant with a selection of Greek food.  Really great Grilled calamari and garlic bread!"}
{"text":"Amazeballs I've eaten here many times and brought my family here and we love it Everything is very tasty and the service is quick  The rotisterie stuff is especially tasty (we've tried the chicken and lamb and a friend has had the pork and loves it) the chicken souvlaki is also great  We usually start with a mix of dips (all are really good)"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place to have a souvlaki dinner. Large portions, with juicy pork souvlaki... and it only gets better because the tzatziki is wonderful in both taste and smell (beware of garlic breath!). I only wish they gave more tzatziki sauce! The greek salad that came with the dinner was also very good and maybe next time I'd settle for a large salad (or going back to work again in a food coma).  The staff were capable of providing good recommendations off of their menu and came by often to fill our glasses of water. A bowl of garlic bread was also served.  They have convenient but limited free parking in front of the store, but you may find it hard to back in/out during rush hours.   Overall, definitely a place I'd try again if I were in the area!"}
{"text":"Based on some positive reviews here on Yelp, I thought I would give this place a try for some quick Greek takeout.  I don't know why, but all the meat we ordered was bland, bland, bland.  No salt, no seasonings, just meat without much char either.  Whether it was the chicken or pork souvlaki, or the chicken or pork Gyros - all of it was so bland that no amount of tzatziki could help it.  The one thing we all agreed we would go back for in a heartbeat was the Briam - a medley of roasted zucchini, potatoes, onions, peppers, and tomatoes.  It was delicious and by far the tastiest thing we ordered.  The rice was just ok, the lima beans were bland and not as tasty as we have had at Pantheon, the Greek salad was ok, but the garlic bread made of hot dog buns made us sad... if we knew it came with bread we would have asked for pita instead.  For gyros, I will go back to Folia Grill just down the street, and for the rest I will rely on Pantheon... even though the prices are higher, the quality is worth it.  Sorry Greek Grill, not sure if I will give you another shot other than for the Briam."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant on a Friday it was pretty packed. I ordered the Mousaka with rice and it came with a Greek salad, the other people in my party order lamb chops with fries and lima beans and chicken breast with vegetables.   The salad was good, however I found the dressing was over powering (way too acidic), I would recommend getting it on the side.   Food arrived in good time, in spite of the restaurant being packed. My dish (Mousaka) was excellent. As was the chicken dish. However the lamb has more fat and gristle than meat and it didn't seem worth the amount charged.  The service was excellent and it seemed like it was family run and very hospitable.   I would have given the restaurant a better rating if the lamb had been of better quality. Definitely not \"Grade AAA\" as described in the menu."}
{"text":"So they got my order wrong. Took it to address I lived at 3 years ago. I used to order from them for over 4 years. They said it was thr trainees fault and i should of confirmed my address. Need I mind you I ordered from them for 4 years. The owner Bill was condescending and rude. They offered me a credit and I wanted to use it then. Also my wife is pregnant so this situation is sensitive. Instead I was dismissed and was insulted.  Never again will I order from them. No customer service. The customer is ALWAYS right."}
{"text":"Excellent experience using the Greek Grill to cater an event. Food was great, price was reasonable, employees were incredibly helpful and friendly from the manager to the delivery crew. I'd recommend them highly."}
{"text":"Biggest bang for your buck  for Greek food, without the hassles of looking for parking on the Danforth. Food is consistently good, with good service.  They have earned my business."}
{"text":"So, it seems I have a bit of a souvlaki obsession. The latest victim of my insatiable appetite is The Greek Grill, located on the (Greek) Danforth, whose menu really meant it when they called my plate a \"large\".   The salad, a little basic with its oil and vinegar (reminding my sister and I both of something we would and have eaten at home), was good and obviously old-school, but we both have a thing for fast-food Greek salads and their more manufactured dressings. But this is our problem, not theirs.  The (large) portion of chicken was very satisfying, both in its volume and its juicy tastiness. The potatoes were thoroughly soaked in flavor and perfectly moist, falling apart delightfully. The tzaziki was some of the most potent I've ever had, requiring about 5 mints to (almost) fade into the past (which of course, is both a good and bad thing at different times).  There was an attractive but comfy interior, friendly waiters, and I believe the owner came up to us a couple of times, offering kind seasons greetings and an opportunity for input in that way only restaurant owners can. Oh! and they cooked something (I'm pretty sure it was the special of the day- fish) in FIRE, right next to us. Now, all I need to do is get over my fear of the unknown (or the un-souvlaki) and try something new-- and more excitingly prepared."}
{"text":"I think this place is like a movie that gets a lot of positive hype and then you see it and are disappointed.  I don't get it.  It wasn't all that good.  The interior was very plain and looked as if they were undergoing renovations.  The souvlaki was okay but not outstanding.  The staff were fairly friendly.  I can get the same quality or better in a mall food court.  I was really hoping it would be terrific.  I may have enjoyed it if I hadn't read the glowing review in advance. They made me have very high expectations."}
{"text":"Typical small mom and dad working behind the grill for a Greek place. We ordered a couple of dishes but it was fairly expensive for mediocre food. So I think it may be better find a better place in the area since it is greek town!   We had the chicken souvlaki and a pork souvlaki, neither tasted memorable or something we want to eat. It was oily and the chicken was dry. I think we came at around 2pm and it was close to the end of lunch time."}
{"text":"Sadly, I need to reduce my rating on the Greek Grill. It was the best Greek restaurant I have found in Toronto but in the past year it has changed and not for the better. The service is not great, food quality is not what it once was and daily specials are never available. I still have hopes it will return to way it was a year ago but each time I come I am disappointed. Time to search for a new Greek haunt."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service. Anything you order is absolutely yummy! If your on the Danforth area this is a must go to place."}
