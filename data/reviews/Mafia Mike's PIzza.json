{"text":"Maffia Mike's Mediocrity! With a coupon for an extra large @12.99 I was charged more than $17 for a sicilian style margherita pizza (which I am generally a fan of)... with tax the $20 I spent went to the smallest \"Xtra Large\" pizza I've encountered with maybe 1/4 of a tomato, marginally flavored dough, a handful of basil leaves, and almost no mozzarella.  While the toppings were good quality they were sparce to say the least, one slice had 4 leaves of basil AND NOTHING ELSE!  Im all for slim eating but for the $ I recommend Nello's or Crust, or if you're looking for a topping full margherita go to Focaccia Fiorentina in Phoenix. With 3 better places to go to why would you go here?"}
{"text":"Like the other poster we received a flyer stating if it isn't the best they will refund the money. So we tried it. Got the pie and it wasn't cooked. I called them and informed them of the situation. The individual said he would refund the money. I said no need just give us another pizza next time we call. He said that was great and gave me his name. Win- Win both I thought. A few weeks later I called the same number and informed the person of the deal and she would have to talk to someone about it. She said she would call back which she did- there was no person by the name I was given. I asked for a manager and she gave me the number to call to talk to some one- which I did and was told the managers were gone until the next morning. So I called another number asked for a manager. He came on the phone and I explained the situation- he said there was no person by that name. by this time I was so irritated that it took 4 phone calls over a $20 items. He said he would give another pizza, but I didn't want to go thru the hassle again and declined. So if your pie is bad and want a refund ,. . . . . expect a interrogation and lots of inconvenience in getting."}
{"text":"Good local family owned place I've only picked up but always good and fresh"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  Why?  We never got our pizza!

The night we found out we were having a baby we wanted to celebrate with a yummy pizza and decided to give this local joint a chance.

We called and placed the order.  After 35 minutes we called and asked for a status update (This place was less than a mile away. What could be taking so long?) The clearly annoyed/annoying woman on the other end of the phone said that it was no longer in the computer so it must be on the way.  We waited, and waited, and waited some more.  So at the 50 minute mark we called again. We got the manager this time who happened to notice that our pizza was sitting right next to him on the counter (Our guess is that it was probably sitting there the first time we called too). He apologized , gave us a refund, and offered us a free pizza the next time we order.  

Next time?  Uh, no, you ruined our evening.  No next time for you."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time with a living social deal.

Atmosphere is = to hungry howies, papa johns etc, has a small sitting area with TV but...I wouldnt want to hang out there. It was hot and sticky....

Staff = spoke very little to us, didnt seem like he wanted to say much. He looked miserable being there. 

Food = Ordered a margherita pizza, better than expected and personally thought it tasted a lot better than hungry howies etc, but it is cooked up exactly the same way as one.  We also ordered \"chicken tenders\" with honey BBQ sauce. We thought the chicken tenders would be breaded/fried (as you would expect), but it was...baked? skinless tenders? (I guess?}, with BBQ sauce dumped on it. Strange.

Eh. Probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Bargain basement pizza at bargain basement prices.  About on the scale of Little Caesars.  I'm not a big pizza fan, so pizza has to be Fan Freakin Tastic for me to go back, and this place just wasn't.  Service was ok, kind of a dumpy little place.  But you know what really got me.  As I was eating, I saw one of the people in the back dump some Frozen Tyson Wings in their prep trays.  So if you really like these people's wings, save yourself some money and go to the grocery store and buy Tyson's, cuz you are getting exactly the same thing.   I thought that was pretty crappy."}
{"text":"Completely DISGUSTING wings don't make up for so-so pizza. I feel like I threw $30 down the drain."}
{"text":"The pizza is great!  It's flavorful and fresh, and the toppings are very good.  The downside?  It's quite expensive for what you're getting.  I haven't ordered from this place without a generous coupon."}
{"text":"This place has very rude manager(owner). He is a total a**whole!!! The pizza is ok but not the best. I would never recommend someone to go there. After having an encounter with the owner, I would not give him my business again nor recommend it to others."}
{"text":"So last week we get a flyer for this place, it was actually put inside of our Lilac planter by our front door.  We decided to give this place a try.  We got a pizza (veggie with no tomatoes), a side salad, two liter of Diet Pepsi, and two large cookies for $20.  That was with delievery.  The pizza was very good.  The dough was just right, not to thick or thin.  When it arrived it smelled wonderful.  It was very good.  I am a person who does not like a lot of sauce on her pizza, so when a place does not totally cover the dough with five ladels of sauce I am happy.  I even usually say light sauce.  We did not tell this place that, and the amount of sauce was perfect.  So I would order from this place agian."}
{"text":"Mafia Mike's isn't the best pizza in the East Valley, but I'm going to give it five stars because it's the best delivery pizza in the area. If you are in the mood for Pizza Hut - Papa Johns - Domino's, you'll be much happier with Mafia Mikes. (If you want five-star eat-in pizza, go to Grimaldi's. I'd give Mafia Mikes three stars on that scale.)

The sauce has good flavor and isn't too sweet, nor does it seem like it was canned. The crust is standard, of medium thickness, and not memorable. I have had both canadian bacon/pineapple and plain old pepperoni, and both were good. The pepperoni was a standout because, unlike so many delivery pizzas, the cheese didn't get coated in a thin layer of orange oil exuding from the meat.

I've also had and enjoyed the side salad, which was a generous portion of what appeared to be romaine (and bibb) lettuce, along with red onions, carrots, and a few other toppings. If you want a bit more than pizza with your meal, I recommend their salads.

On a side note, after ordering not long after they opened, I got a hand-written thank you note with a special offer. It was a nice touch, and I hope this kind of customer service helps them compete in this market."}
{"text":"I'm going to stick to Papa John's. Even with the coupon taped to my door and hoping that I would have a cute really good hole-in-the-wall right by me, I was hoping to like it. Unbelievably bad and expensive for what it is. The Marguerita pizza was a frozen pizza-esque version with a glob of garlic, and. one strip of mozzarella. Don't go."}
