{"text":"This is my spot to get a hoagie Philly cheese steak btw. Nice, friendly people that work there. I always call ahead of time for my order so as soon as I pull up its ready. Good spot."}
{"text":"Not anywhere near A real Detroit coney island . It's more like hormal chilie out of a can.  I ordered a loose burger  instead I got a chop up hamburger patty  on a hot dog  bun. I work at a few coney island in detroit so i know that alot of them order from chicago beef .I ask why don't you  order from them and he told me that he dont order frozen food i ask him arent your fries frozen...LMAO my family and I laugh the entire time we were there.
what a waste of time and money !
If you're from Detroit you'll know  !"}
{"text":"I ordered the Philly cheesesteak with no peppers or onions. The first time she brought it out it had all of that on it, I told her I asked for it plain. She then asked if I wanted to pick the toppings off because it would take too long to cook another one. So she took it back, 25 minutes later the cook brought my food out with peppers on it. Even though i asked twice for it plain with no onions or peppers. I asked for silverware and never got it, I asked for a straw and the waitress gave me a straw un-wrapped and holding it with her hands. This place has decent food but the customer service is horrible!!!! I most likely will not be back! This restaurant does not seem to value good customer service. Worst experience ever all I got to eat was my fries."}
{"text":"I ate here with my sister and I had the Philly deluxe and onion rings, onion rings were pretty good, the sandwich not so much it had a lot of  Grisel it was pleasant lol  and the cheese sauce didn't have much flavor. The service was good  and it came out fast but overall the food wasn't great to me."}
{"text":"I pass this place everyday and notice people inside which I thought was a good sign. Our food took over an hour to receive ,now I understand all the people. Cesar salad, po boy, Chicago dog and a philly cheese.  My onion rings sat for a calculated 3 minutes before I said if they are cold don't bring them. They didn't try to make it right just removed them from the bill.

The worst part was only after the sandwichs were placed did they decide to make the salad. Then told my daughter \"we don't really have a cesar salad on the menu\". Well since it was printed right on the menu not sure why she said that. 

I really wish the service was something I could stand becuse the food (that made it to the table) was good. The po boy had fresh made slaw and crispy fish. It was slightly dry but remedied with a little tartar sauce. The Chicago dog tasted like a hot dog stand and the philly had nice portions.  

Several customers left due to the wait.  The place was not spotless but not filthy (except the restroom). Phx Coney please try harder. Teach your staff to hussle and cook more than one order at a time. It such a shame to let a good location, good food and a good decor go to waste."}
{"text":"It was good. Cool stuff on the wall. I think they make their ranch from scratch, it was good. Oh, and very nice people there."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, maybe two customers ahead of me, waited for 30 minutes for a sandwich. Get your act together, should take 30 minutes to make one 8 inch philly cheese steak"}
{"text":"My husband is from Detroit and was very excited to see an ad for this place. When we went. It was extremely hot. We asked them to turn on the air twice. We could see the temp and it was at 90 in there. They never changed the temp. It just kept getting hotter. We got the Coney Hot Dog and my husband saw that there was a loose meat sandwich on the menu and ordered it. He was so excited! While waiting, I heard the cook start chopping something on the grill. I jokingly told my husband that it was his loose meat sandwich. He said no way. Needless to say, they brought out a chopped burger patty on a hot dog bun. It was awful. My husband said that that's not how you make a loose meat sandwich, he said it was an embarrassment. Not thrilled with our experience!"}
{"text":"Went back last week for the first time in a long time.  I am surprised so many Yelpers have had a bad experience in more recent times.  I had a Philly Cheese Steak and it was incredible.  The server was a teen and he was professional and polite.  If this place is under new ownership, its too bad the previous ownership is gone, but I did not receive a lower level of service by any means from the new ownership."}
{"text":"First off the owners (Husband and Wife) are natives of Detroit, Michigan.  I'm also a native of Michigan so my expectations were really high and they exceeded them. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted nicely and quick. We didn't feel rushed and they explained the menu (I already knew what I was coming for and that was a Detroit Coney Dog). You know it's not a real Detroit Coney if you don't have to cut the sides off the container it comes in lol. I also got a Shrimp w/Slaw P'Boy and it was excellent. And to top it off they gave us free slices of red velvet cake. If your a Michigan native, live in Phoenix or are visiting you must stop here and try them out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for the first time, we were welcomed immediately. I felt like we were important to them which is very rare in AZ. We ordered the Italian Beef Hoggie, Philly Cheese Steak, chili cheese frys, tots and the carrot cake. Well let me tell you we were extremely impressed! This is the place to go. We will be returning customers."}
{"text":"The food was ok but for a place called Coney Island I expected quick service and it was so slow. our group had to get our food to go and then eat it cold because we were late for our appointment due to super slow service.   I would probably not return"}
{"text":"AMAZING food. I had the Chicken & Slaw Po'Boy tonight, and all I can say is wow! The flavors were amazing, and even though I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, I really enjoyed my meal. Bigger portion than I expected, and that is always a plus. :)"}
{"text":"Just visited today 05/31/14. The business has changed owners. The service is substandard. The staff is not friendly and they are not familiar with coney dogs at all.

The staff are the kids of the owner and it shows. They sigh if you ask for refills, sigh when you as for the bill and are not even familiar with their revised menu.

I will NOT be returning there anymore. If you are the owner reading this, you have lost my business."}
{"text":"First time here. Will come back for more. I informed the waitress that I was new and what would she recommend, she said either the cheese steaks, po'boys, and burgers.I never had a po'boy so my attention was diverted to that. So I ordered the po'fat boy (shrimp,fish, slaw) with side of tater tots. Everything came out hot and crunchy. While waiting I over heard other customer questioning the waitress about the menu, she was very knowledgeable about it which is a plus for me. Overall the experience was very good, only giving it a 4 star because a 5 is well a . Again I recommend if you are in the area give this place a try. Hours may vary."}
{"text":"OMG the young man at the counter! He's just the sweetest! Customer service is big for me and it was on point! I'll be going back of course!"}
{"text":"For a cheap eat, this place is it. Honestly, I think non-natives -- of which I happen to be one -- who complain about Phoenix Coney Island are expecting a duplication of what they had in [insert East Coast choice of city here]. Well, it's not. But what PCI does offer I found to be excellent.

My girlfriend and I had four dogs and two drinks, INCLUDING tax, for less than $13. Seriously, less than $13? Yay me and my wallet! Anyway, she's an aficionado of Chicago-style hot dogs so she had one of those and split a Phoenix dog with me, salsa on the side. I opted for a chili dog with added cheese (50Â¢ extra) and a Detroit coney.

Downsides?

1. Chicago dog doesn't use a true Vienna sausage. So what? It's still all-beef and had all the other authentic Vienna toppings.
2. Phoenix dog is similar to a Sonoran dog, except it's not a Sonoran dog. But it's not pretending to be one either.
3. Chili dog uses canned chili. However, that shit is still awesome whether on something from DQ, Sonic, a homemade omelet, or this place. Snobs need to get over themselves that PCI doesn't \"make their own\". Ask yourself this: when you drove up to the place, did it look to you as though they would be making their own chili? No? Then perhaps you should have fucked off and not pulled into the parking lot.

Upsides?

1. Did I mention four dogs and two drinks for under $13? Drinks are a freakin' buck fifty. Not even Denny's can match that price.
2. Extensive menu will keep you from getting bored.
3. We asked for a sample of the Italian beef and were quite pleased with the flavors, even without being dunked and \"dragged through the garden\". Will be having that on my next visit fo' sho'.
4. The Detroit coney and Phoenix dog both had been lightly deep-fried, which gave a serious snap when you bit into them. I happen to like that, but others may find it a detraction.

For a nearby cheap eat, this was worth every penny. No, it's not upscale, but they do know their neighborhood clientele. Most everything on the menu is $6 or less and the staff were very courteous and helpful when describing the hotdog options. I'll definitely be returning soon to work my way further through their menu."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in for lunch today.  Good food, great service.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I think the loose burger may have given me a loose stool.  They also messed up on my change when I paid.  I gave them a fifty and they tried to give me change for a twenty.  We got that straightened out before I left.  I probably will not go back..."}
{"text":"Five stars! What else can I say?? Food was delicious and definitely filling! Service was very friendly and fast! Can't say a negative thing about the place! I will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm too picky. But I had high hopes for this place being from Michigan, since it is spoused  to be like Detroit style and AZ style and had decent yelp reviews..Haven't ate yet but so far waitress is awful she gave me a hard time about wanting a chicken gyro making sure to tell me its not a \"gyro\" and seeming confused that I just wanted to sub chicken for the other meat with no tomatoes how hard is that.. Then it came out just now and had tomato.. waited till I was done eating to get my mothers order and only got it after one of the other friendlier waitresses checked on us as our first waitress was packing up and leaving.. Like what the heck.. I may try it again as the food wasn't terrible, wasn't amazing either. But the mother daughter and African American gal wait staff was very kind and helpful.."}
{"text":"Went looking for a Sonoran Dog and heard this place had a Phoenix Dog that was close to a Sonoran Dog. It was further then I use go for food but closest place with a Sonoran Dog. It was YUMMY!!! So were the onion rings. Not over priced either. The hot dogs are all beef and deep fried. Very clean and nice services."}
{"text":"An okay, not great, place on the Westside for Midwesterners to get a Coney fix. Second time eating here, first time in 2 years. No particular reason for the length of time. Both dining experiences were the Detroit style coney islands. Service was friendly. Obviously a family-run restaurant. I didn't have to pay until I was finished eating. Nice sized TV to watch. There was a pesky fly buzzing around. However the restaurant and restroom was clean. Overall, it was good for Phoenix but not for Detroit. I found the flavor of the chili somewhat lacking. I will return and it won't take another 2 years."}
{"text":"OK.  This place has to make it in this somewhat jinxed location.  First a never ending stream of Mexican restaurants and the last tenant was a Hawaiian BBQ with decent but not striking food.  These folks have completely redone the space.  The sandwich and onion rings I had were excellent.  The folks running the place are friendly and efficient.  When you are placing the order they ask all sorts of questions to make sure it comes out the way you want it, not just the way they want to make it.  While the place was not crowded it was obvious several of the folks eating there or picking up to go orders were already regular customers.  There are lots of items on the menu and I will be back to try some more of them."}
{"text":"This place was really good! We had Ula as a server, she was very attentive, my drink was always full. The food was actually better than I had anticipated seeing that it was inexpensive. 


We had the crispy chicken gyro, a Detroit coney, French fries with cheese, and a drink for $11! The gyro was delicious, the chicken was on point!  I would come back again, it's worth the 15 minute drive from my house!"}
{"text":"When I first heard about this place just down the street from my home I was excited..I always welcome locally owned restaurants into my neighborhood. 

A friend and I decided to try it since we were in the mood for hot dogs.. We walked in on a Sunday morning about 10:45..atmosphere is very bright and clean .. There were only a couple of elderly gentlemen reading the paper. 

We were greeted nicely by our waitress..my friend ordered a Philly cheesesteak with fries then was told they were changing the frying oil.. Now I'm not sure if its the best idea to change your oil right between breakfast and lunch.. so he ordered macaroni salad.  

I decided on a Greek salad and a Detroit coney dog, she brought out the Greek salad and it was delicious.. And brought my friend his potato salad which wasn't what he asked for but was fine and he graciously took it. 

About 30 minutes later they finally brought out the cheesesteak .. Looked amazing but beef had no seasoning whatsoever..I'm still waiting on my hot dog .. About 5 minutes later the hot dog arrived..I guess in my mind I was expecting a serious hot dog but it was basically just a generic bun with chili and chopped onions..something I could whip up myself in a few minutes at home..While good it didn't wow me. 

The menu was packed with good eats and is very inexpensive .. Now they seemed to be having some issues in the kitchen and overheard them waiting on the owner so I know that can affect service.. But waiting 45 minutes for food that should take minutes to prepare isn't gonna keep the doors open. 

I just hope they can polish out their service and food some and have a great business .. I'm sure ill give this place another chance and have an updated review."}
{"text":"I would probably give this place 3.5 stars but I am rounding up. The food was good. We had a Coney Island, fries, macaroni salad, and the Greek salad.  The Greek salad had really good homemade dressing.  I liked the macaroni salad but I like most macaroni salads.  My husband enjoyed his coney and the fries were freshly fried. The only problem was how long it took to get everything. I think we waited about 25 minutes and there were not many people ahead of us.  I think they have a few kinks to work out in the kitchen. Overall a good place and I wish it success."}
{"text":"My Detroit dog and fries were very good.  But, as others have said, it was too hot in the dining room. 85 deg is what I saw so not as bad as others at 90 deg but still unpleasant if you leave soaked in sweat. Won't be back in the summer time. Will go back in the winter if I have a hankerin' for a Detroit and fries!"}
{"text":"Ordered a double burger with cheese meal, total $7.50 The meal included a burger and fries.  The beef patties were flavorless and hard. The fries were dry and lacked seasoning. Overall I was not impressed with the food. Ive had better burgers from the frozen aisle. I don't think Ill return to this restaurant. FYI The meal does not include a drink."}
{"text":"As a native Detroiter, I grew up on Coney Islands, as their a staple.  Most people have a favorite one, and when I left Detroit, I found that Phoenix doesn't really have any Coney Islands.  When a friend told about this place and how it just opened, I KNEW I had to go try it, and today I did just that.

Upon entering, the place is in a tired little strip mall, but inside its the closest thing I can get to a Detroit Coney.  The menu is large and ample, with lots of Detroit goodies, such as a coney dog with all the fixings (chili, onions, etc.) Gyros, greek salads, fries and a whole bunch of other items that are made as they should be. I liked the fact that the menu spanned the entire back wall and was on huge flat screen TV's.  They also have some Detroit memorabilia on the walls of old car stuff which was really cute, and the interior was simply decorated with an open window to the grill so you could see the cook making your food as the girl took the order.

Overall the food was good. I went with the Gyro and fries with a coke, and it came out tasty!  it was a bit garlicly, but in a good way.  I had also wanted to get a greek salad, but I knew there was no way I could eat all that food in one sitting, so I passed. I still have to try the coney dogs, as they have a few options here (Chicago, Detroit and Phoenix style dogs) but I think I will get that next time I go.

They had a steady stream of people coming in and out on a Sunday afternoon, and the girl behind the counter was busy as all get out.   The only thing that suffered was I got my food a good 5 minutes before my friend did, so bad timing on her part. I hate when that happens!  My friend didn't mind and neither did I, but I could have waited to eat (which I did) and that was probably the only thing with the meal that didn't go right. Every thing else was awesome!

If your from Detroit, back east, or just want some seriously good coney food, come here. Its like a little slice of home.  Local business support as well, and worth a trip for those of you who like this kind of stuff. Enough of a menu selection and a good price point to keep everyone happy and guarantee that you'll walk out with a full stomach like I did!  They also have a rockin breakfast menu as well!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place.  My wife grew up in Michigan and I lived there for many years.  It was however a great disappointment.  

I had a Detroit Coney dog and a Phoenix dog.  The Detroit dog had something that tasted like Hormel Chilly on it not coney sauce.  The hot dog it self was way over cooked and looked more like the meat sticks you get at the gas station. The Phoenix dog on the other hand was like a Sonoran dog.  I love those thing and this one was ok but there are much better ones in town.  I also got Mac salad.  It was flavorless.  

My wife got a Greek salad with gyro meat.  The meat did not look right but tasted good and the salad had a good flavor.  She was however very upset at the service.  The food did not come all at once and we had to remind them what we ordered.  The staff seemed nice but it just did not come together well.

We will not be returning.  There is a better Coney Island place is Scottsdale."}
{"text":"under new middle eastern management! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! No pork dogs at all! No Coney Island dogs! None! No bacon! it's turkey bacon...waste of time as well...it took me 43 minutes to get 4 hot dogs that tasted like grocery store hot dogs...and...Falafel is on its way! Yuck!
Do NOT go here. This place sucks...the waitresses whisper under their breath apologies...They will never make here. This is America. Deal with it and don't buy a Coney Hot Dog restaurant and then stop serving Coney Island dogs! Frauds!"}
{"text":"This has been our 4th time eating here. Each time has been a different experience and not all have been great. Overall, it's a nice place to eat. The decor looks like an old-style diner & soda fountain. Very appealing and family-friendly. 

The menu is extensive. So many different types of sandwiches: hoagies, melts, burgers, dogs and fish/shrimp baskets. 

Unfortunately, this menu seems to overwhelm the cooks. The past two times I ate there with two of my kids, it took over 30 minutes for us to get our food - way too long. 

To sum it up: good food, good service, good ambiance. Long wait for food."}
{"text":"Food was terrible no taste its under new ownership they don't know what a coney hotdog or anything on the menu looks like bottom line the food was very bad don't waste ur time coming here"}
