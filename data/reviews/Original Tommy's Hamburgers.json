{"text":"Ah Tommy's, you either love it or hate it. If you like greasy, calorie-packed, delicious fast food and like reflecting poorly on your diet plan, then Tommy's is the place to go. You can't go wrong with a double-cheeseburger with chili-cheese fries! Tommy's is by far one of the best burger joints on the west coast, easily up there with in-n-out, possibly better. The chili resembles something that you can buy in a pet aisle, but it makes up for it's awful looks in it's personality (like that one girl in college that always wondered why you never wanted to hang out in public with her). Not too spicy, not too mild, a perfect taste and an ultimate addition to any of their meals.        If you aren't that thirsty don't buy a large drink, it's big enough to get you five years in prison if you walked outside with it in New York. But if you're willing to take on the bucket of carbonated sugar-syrup than by all means go to town. Don't pay too much attention to the bad reviews on here, some people just don't appreciate a tantalizing meal like Tommy's can serve up! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of location. VERY eye-catching, but the parking lot holds only a handful of cars, so you'll have to park a little ways away, but you'll need to burn the calories anyways. So whether you're heading home from work or taking your prom date out for the fancy meal she's waited her whole high-school career for, Tommy's is most definitely the place to go, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Love my chili burgers from Tommy's ! Also love the chili fries as well...But I warn you, you gotta love chili and the mess"}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  Bland. Signature chili is a paste. Fries were weak. Really nothing positive to write about other than free refills."}
{"text":"Due to some recent unfortunate dining events, the VBB will no longer be taking recommendations from friends when it relates to large chains of burger joints. This very much refers to yesterday's meal I had at Tommy's, which was less than ideal and left my stomach a bit unhappy. There's clearly no suspense in this review but I'll go ahead and give you my full rundown anyway.  At this point I have pretty much vowed to stick to stand-alone joints, one of a kind locations that are unique to Vegas, to go against my plan and try this place anyway was my mistake. Sure I've reviewed In-N-Out and a few other small regional chains, but no more. I had high hopes yesterday of finding some underground spot to try, but my initial plans fell through when after doing a bit of research I found out that the kitchen at a local dive bar had closed and they were no longer serving food. Trying to stick to a location somewhat near my office, I instead went with the recommendation of my coworker for Tommy's because he had mentioned it a few times and it was right around the corner. Much like my mistake with going back to Five Guys due to the convenience, this was not good.  There are only two locations in Vegas, the one I went to is right next to St Rose Hospital, and is in a very desolate looking parking lot. There were maybe three people when I went inside, the clientele looked very much like the folks I mentioned in my Farmer Boys article. The interior d√©cor was a cross between a very cheap In-N-Out and A&W. I didn't really do any research on their website before going over there which was a bad idea, because as soon as I walked in and saw the images of their burgers with the descriptions of their chili I knew this was bad. But I was already standing at the counter so it was too late to turn back.  I ordered the single chili cheeseburger meal, complete with all the toppings: tomato, pickles, mustard, onions and chili. After waiting almost 10 minutes for my number to be called for some reason, I sat down ready to dig in. The meal looked completely uninspired and generic, just as any fast food burger should. And this is exactly where the problem lies; I am supposed to be blogging about great, unique gourmet burgers, not sitting at a generic garbage fast food chain! The bun was plain, starchy, and about as typical as they come. The patty itself wasn't too bad, but the awful chili took away any sort of flavor from the rest of the burger. I really don't think I need to get into much detail here like I usually do; this is just a gross fast food chili burger, plain and simple. But yes, I finished it anyway.  The fries were also as typical as they could be, frozen generic steak fries that were barely at room temperature. I do have one positive thing to say though; my iced tea was ok. The other awesome redeeming factor of this meal is that I got this awesome picture of what looks like a skid mark left by my burger.  I can't reiterate enough; this blog is to review unique, quality burgers in Las Vegas. When I started the blog I immediately swore off McDonald's, Burger King and the like, so to even venture into this place was counter-productive. And because this was so bad, now I have to go out and eat a second burger this week to hopefully get a somewhat more decent review posted. Woe is me."}
{"text":"Really a good deal for the price. $15 for the 2 of us. Had the #3 with chili on the side. Great burger. Crisp fries & and bomb chili!!"}
{"text":"This place by far is the worst.. first of the chili cheese fries & burger lacked flavor..I been going to tommys since I was a kid..there's nothing like the original tommys in downtown LA..This staff should learn from LA when it comes to food preparation & customer service"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here and it was as bad as I remembered. The burger/chili combo was weird tasting and cold, even though we waited forever in the drive-thru for our order. I will not go back even though they are very close to me."}
{"text":"I went here once when it first opened, and it was a little off the mark. Now a days its Tommys, like you expect, but cleaner than most, as its still pretty new. Don't let them forget your fork on those chili fries to go."}
{"text":"Tommy's is so delicious!!!! I asked a few people if they like it or have eaten there before and I got a few good feed backs. I guess Tommy's is not for everyone but I do know that if your from CALIFORNIA you will like it. I'm glad they opened one in Nevada because you can't go wrong with a good chili burger every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Tried Tommy's on whim.  So glad I did!  Got the double chili cheese burger combo. I loves me some toasted bun and this one was amazing.  The burger party was that old school thin style and had great flavor.  The chili was thick and hearty.  I took a star off for the fries, generic greasy diner fries."}
{"text":"Not bad. Just not as good as the the Tommy's I have been to previously. Ate in on a Friday night and they weren't that busy. Not a good sign on the weekend. Very clean and well kept. Staff was quite friendly. My major complaint is that there are no shakes offered at this location. That didn't make me happy as Tommy's is home to some of my favorite shakes. I was told the manager moved their shake machine to a busier location. WTF."}
{"text":"Brand new, neat and clean.  Tommy's is famous for chili.  Now some of you lightweights might cry about heartburn or the runs, but the chili is meaty and tasty without being overpowering.  Chili comes on everything.  Cheeseburgers, fries, hot dogs, shakes, just kidding.  Don't be afraid.  Its a So-Cal classic that you will love."}
{"text":"I give this Tommy's 3 stars only because it was clean and the employees are nice. We didn't care for the food at all. Maybe when back when we were kids or teens this food would have been better."}
{"text":"Never busy in here and I see why, the service and quality of food need to go up. Not the same as their California counterparts and kinda disappointed with the freshness of their food!"}
{"text":"Guess I should have yelped this place before going ... Not to be confused wit the Tommy's burger in Barstow! These r one of the worse burgers I've had -_- tasteless and the fries dull and again tasteless .... Won't be coming back .. Took longer for the cashier to get my order right then to eat. No wonder this place is always empty"}
{"text":"Tommy's Hamburgers are awesome.   I don't like chilli anyways so I always order the cheeseburger without chilli. Very very good.   Also the french fries are big and thick. I love the French fries.   They are always fast friendly and super clean restaurant. I have only been to the one on craig rd. In las vegas. I love it."}
{"text":"Always a stop for us when there is one around. As it so happened there was one about 20 miles away. You can't beat their chili. The burgers and fries aen't bad either but it's all about the chili. If your felling lucky order the chili tamale. I would move into it if I could. Plus it's cheap. Almost as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Normally it was our treat driving between Las Vegas and So Cal we would stop in Lenwood.  The grease has made me feel sick a number of times but somehow I keep coming back here - it is addicting. Until they posted the calories then I took a hiatus out of guilt but I still love it. Yes, it is horribly unhealthy and greasy but somehow it is just so good. You have to get chili though - I recently went here with someone who ordered the California burger with no chili - and this is just a no no, if you are not going to get chili then the burger in itself is much better elsewhere.   The chili makes it, some sort of beanless chili. I usually get the cheeseburger and if it is really a splurge then chili cheese fries.  Also, they have brewed ice tea - another plus and you can ask for sport peppers on the side.   Glad they finally opened this location! Although, my waist line curses them for doing so."}
{"text":"Had the mega combo = 3 patties, 3 cheese burger , chili fries and gal of soda(lol)diet of course,maybe not a gal but it is huge.         Triple chili burger a bit messy for me, should have gone double.        Pretty consistent with previous review, middle of road chili for the masses , not too spicy or hot.  Chili cheese fries pretty good , but should have gotten plain fries to much chili for me."}
{"text":"We were so exited to try this place out. Total fail. Burgers no flavor what so ever! Eww and the chili disgusting. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Well since I have never been to this hole the wall they \"generously\" gave me a chili sample that looked like umm someone real sick lol and tasted about the same and spicy I don't like.  Finally she got my order taken, hotdog with fixings and a drink. She talked me out of orange juice wtf.  Then the order comes up and their are fries there and a soda and hot dog. I didn't order fries I know that %100 for sure because I am on a strict and do not eat them but I still paid for and threw them away. One star for the loaded no chili hotdog.  That was alright.  Never going back!!"}
{"text":"Employees did not get order correct.   Once I got the right food the buns were soggy, next to no chili on the chili burger, and the meat was full of gresel.  Very expensive."}
{"text":"This place is for the chili lovers.  Everything on the menu comes with chili except one, which is a cheeseburger that doesn't have any unique taste to it. I ordered the chili cheeseburger and I couldn't taste the burger because they were generous on the chili and it overpowered the entire burger. Same goes with the French fries. The place is clean and staff were great. If it's your first time at this place, they offer free tasting of their chili, which is a great idea so u can decide if you want the chili or not on your burger."}
{"text":"Tommy's is a guilty pleasure for sure. Comfort food at its finest. If your looking for healthier option then go to In & Out.  But if you're looking for a burger dripping in chili, lettuce, onion, pickles and a patty that tastes fresh then Tommy's is calling your name.  I like the fries by themselves and also drowning in chili. Even the drinks taste good. It may just be a California thing. But if on a Saturday night you find yourself alone and need a little comforting.........Tommy's is there waiting for you."}
{"text":"Pulled up to the drive thru, cause parking there sucks. First time there so had to take a quick look at the menu.. Ordered a #2 cheeseburger combo. Got to the house, unwrapped my burger WHO THE F**** KNEW IT CAME WITH ALL THAT DAMN CHILI ON IT? SERIOUSLY. I think the dude put a whole can of chili on my burger. I couldn't even enjoy it. People: if u want a sloppy joe, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"A once in a lifetime experience, hopefully.  Must be a California thing. Chili on everything,  the consistency of baby food. Had to search to find the burger patty. The chili  cheese fries turned neon from the  greese. Burped all the way down the 95 to the airport."}
{"text":"I can't wait for Tommy's to open here in Henderson!!! On their web site it says they're opening at the end of November...I haven't checked the restaurant site yet, but I'm waiting patiently :) Mmm mmm mmm, I'm craving for a Tommy's chili cheeseburger and chili cheese fries!"}
{"text":"Tasted exactly as I remembered growing up in LA.  The only problem is that my tastes have changed and now it is too greasy and heavy for me.  I suppose if I'm plastered I would love a Tommy's burger, but I would positively regret it the next day."}
{"text":"Please, let me save you some time and money. This is absolutely the worst fast food ever.  Chili is like bean crud. Burgers are a sloppy mess. No idea how these guys are in business."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second try. First time in was a bit meh...but I was willing to give it another shot. I ordered regular cheese burgers and fries well done for the fam. The fries were all undercooked and all the burgers had bits of chilli on them. The chilli was disgusting and the \"cheese fry\" was fries with slices of American cheese. Just.....not a good meal."}
{"text":"LA classic chili cheese burger. i am seriously addicted to this place and have been eating there for many many years."}
{"text":"Tommy's is a yummy way to get a \"food baby\" going--you know when you eat a real gut bomb and your tummy sticks out like you are preggers? All burgers have tomato, mustard, pickles and chili--yes chili is standard unless you ask not to have it. However, this is not your average chili. It is more of a condiment than something you would eat as a standalone dish. Much too heavy for that, it is actually spreadable. I ordered my double cheeseburger with thousand island dressing and tomato only. My daughter had hers with the chili, mustard, pickle and tomato. The patties are super thin and yummy. I might order a triple next time because I love meat. I tried Ava's burger with the chili and found it to be quite tasty that way. However, I couldn't say as much for the fries...just your standard burger-joint fries. They are not thin and crispy like Micky D's, who make the world's best fries. I also didn't care for the chili and cheese on my fries. It didn't work as well as it did on the burger. Tommy's is greasy goodness, but I doubt I would ever make the extra effort to drive over there just for a burger or to try one of their hot dogs or (sounds interesting) a chili tamale. However, if I was REALLY hungry and underweight again, I might indulge if, and only if, I was in the area. Nice service too."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this after hearing the excitement from other people that \"Tommy's is coming to Vegas!!!\" After a short description that included \"the chili is kind of like Hormel\", I was in. I've always kind of liked Hormel chili, but I also always thought it to be the lowest possible standard for chili. Tommy's has lowered the bar.   The chili is a weird sticky/greasy concoction that they dump on everything. It barely tastes like anything... They give samples to everyone before they order, I think because they KNOW it's horrible and most people will hate it.   Even after the bad sample, I got a chili cheeseburger, hoping it would work in its home environment. It didn't."}
{"text":"great place. always get my order right. and its never a long wait. I love coming here because it has great chili cheese fries and its a 5 min drive from my home. great!"}
{"text":"This place is very clean. The service was great and friendly but above all the burger was absolutely perfect. Been to many Tommy's even their original and some of them just can't get it right. But the guy here cooking the burgers made it just like I used to get it in the 80s. Great job."}
{"text":"I know the chili is a bit much but I like it. I know that  there are lots of Californians that would agree with me.Its sloppy and unhealthy but it's so good. If you have never been here make sure you order the chili on the side. Its not pretty when the chili is just slathered everywhere. This location is on a weird spot and it's difficult to get to and the prices are a bit high. It's ok because this place is just a bi annual  ritual for me. You can't eat this everyday. Be forewarned; it's greasy and sloppy. Do your homework before you have an original Tommy's."}
{"text":"I am not a big chili fan but I would have to say that the chili at Tommy's is pretty darn good. Especially on the fries. The consistency is ideal to put in a burger but I actually prefer it on the fries only and not in the burger. Too messy inside the burger. This place can get expensive if you want chili on everything. It looks disgustingly messy but surprisingly it all works well together to create a great flavor."}
{"text":"I have always loved Tommys! Chili burger is awesome! That and some chili cheese fries... Delish!"}
{"text":"I am originally from cali. And the whole time I lived there till I was 28 never tried them. I finally hv. Lets put it this way. I havent missed a thing. They should bring the HAT out here. Now ur talking."}
{"text":"When I'm craving Tommy's , this is my spot . I grew up on this in LA and since moving to Vegas from Hawaii , finding Tommy's here has given me a piece of home and I only live down the street"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars cause the staff was pretty nice. The food. Omg. The burger patty , damn I shoulda paid the extra .80 for a patty I could actually see and taste. I tried the chili when I first got there as a free sample, no I hate the chili.  So if you think this food is good, plz go to in and out."}
{"text":"Ok! I have to stand up for this location! I've been going to Tommy's locations my whole life and so when I saw all the negative reviews about this one I figured this one just wasn't on their game, maybe bad owners, but nonetheless I obviously took a gamble.  No. This Tommy's is exactly how I've experienced Tommy's my whole life.  Yes, it's greasy. Yes, the chili is thick and it's certainly questionable what's in it...but it's always been like that!!!!! Pink's Hotdogs chili is the same way...but people love that stuff.  I enjoyed my meal... I got a chili cheese dog and chili cheese fries, and it was my boyfriend's first time there, someone with no preconceived expectations, and he loved it.  If you're expecting something gourmet, you need to take your prissy self somewhere else.   Other reviewers were saying it was too expensive for them. For us, 2 chili cheese dogs, chili fries and a medium drink cost us like 12 bucks. .....So.....  The employees were also super nice. It's a fast food place, don't expect them to kiss your ass.   I love Tommy's for its calorie dense, old-school, greasy, totally delicious food."}
{"text":"So great to have this legendary spot in the Northwest. Make sure to try the chili tamale"}
{"text":"Worst drive thru experience ever !!!!! Worst drive thru experience ever I was waiting for someone to take my order from the speaker waited exactly 10 min... they were only serving one car the cashier didn't even bother to acknowledge us we had to back up and leave from the drive thru"}
{"text":"So I love Tommy's and never had a problem with drive thru until today. I was waiting for several minutes this morning at 8:42. I knew the time because I was heading to an appointment.  I honked twice and drove to the window... No one. I ended up going inside and the lady switched something on her headset. I got my order and out by 8:55. Late for my appt"}
{"text":"I have been going to Tommy's since 1968, and I have visited this location at least a dozen times.  Today was the worst burger I have ever had at a Tommy's.  Whoever runs this restaurant needs to give their cooks a Tommy's 101 lesson on how to make a Tommy's burger.  The reason a Tommy's is great because of the combinations of ingredients.  They all contribute to the taste of the burger.  My chili-cheese burger was awful.  I always get it with everything.  My burger had maybe two pickles, no mustard I could taste, maybe five bits of onion and the smallest tomato slice I have ever seen at Tommy's.  All of these flavors build up the overall taste. When I don't go back for a second burger,(this is the first time in 48 years), you know it was bad.  I ate there at 1pm on April 27, 2016.  I will never go back, and I am a Tommy's junkie...The chili was not up to par either, what a bummer"}
{"text":"Well happy 70th Tommy, growing up in Southern California I remember cruising in my dads corvette after the Sunday morning car wash to get what I though was the best chili joint a kid could enjoy. 11 years later moved to Vegas came to try you out here and gotta say not what I remembered this joint to be"}
{"text":"Ordered to number 2 that would be cheeseburgers medium fries and two medium drink food was good the restaurant was very clean this service Personnel was very friendly we live in Vegas this one was up in Henderson if we're back in the area we will come back"}
{"text":"Ewww...To quote the below, \"chili on everything\"...hardly. It's gelatenous mess of goo they pile on the burger and call it \"chili\". It was probably the most disgusting burger I've ever eaten.  I went exactly one time 4 years ago (at the recommendation of my 'boss' at the time) and have not looked back since.   UGH!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. Nothing spectacular. The cheese fries were good, but it's a slice of American cheese melted over fries, so kinda hard to mess that up haha. As for the chili burger.. The patty was pretty bland and you can get better chili at Weinerschnitzel. The food was decent, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was weened on Tommy's ( Bev & Rampart, Roscoe & 405 , Lynwood ) so i'm very Familiar with them. The Customer Service was Excellent as well as my 2 Tommy's Burgers ( extra Chili of course). Still mmmm Good. You haven't lived unless you have eaten there. After YEARS of emailing them, the Koulax Family has opened 3 locations in Las Vegas ... and we are Glad they did !"}

{"text":"My favorite place to stop when I am in Vegas the tamales covered. With the chilling cheese and topping are optional are delicious and French fries  are crispy the establishment is very clean and wait help are friendly a great place to get a reasonable meal if you never been there you gotta check it out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great burgers great chili cheese fries!"}
{"text":"I still can't believe NV has Tommy's locations let alone one on my side of town. I will be a regular at this shack you can count on that! I got through my work day and couldn't wait to break in this location on its grand opening day. There was naturally a line when we got inside so I waited to get a table for us while my wife ordered. It didn't take long for our food to arrive and it looked so damn good. I ordered the caliente burger combo. The caliente burger is their original chili burger, but it has chipotle cheese and sliced cascabella chilies on it. I wanted an extra beef patty on it which cost $1.40 and was worth it. I like how you can ask for extra chili on your burger for no extra charge. My burger was great, my fries were great, I was happy. The side of chilies really hit the spot too. It is nice that the food tastes consistent and just like I remember from eating at Tommy's when I lived in southern California.   Not much parking out front, but This location is really tucked into a corner so you will need to most likely park in the strip mall parking which isn't far away. They have a drive thru, but I would only recommend this if you are in a hurry because when you get it to go the food gets wrapped tighter and then you just end up opening your food to find most of the chili on the wrapper."}
{"text":"Nothing special. No original chili sauce not really good quality cheese it's a combination of nacho cheese and pasteurized cheese. No flavor I wouldn't waste my time"}
{"text":"Good burgers and good fries. Not a huge fan of the chili, but I come for the burgers and fries. Good friendly service too."}
{"text":"good and rather tasty but don't see all the hype.  Lots of calories on those chili cheese fries but you should know that in advance."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here, you are missing out! No it's not healthy, but that's what makes it sooo good. Can't beat the prices either"}
{"text":"Cali girl at heart (born & raised) so of course I love Tommy's. Brings me back to my HS days where I never gave calories a second thought and I had a chili burger and chili cheese fries every Friday after the football games. Now it's strictly limited to cheat meals. ;)   What sets them apart is their chili, so order that (not a plain burger). A chili burger, cheese fries and a side of chili. Because I love crispy fries, adding chili on top makes it too mushy for my liking. They serve breakfast too. Egg & sausage sandwiches or burritos. Always hits the spot.   Tip: This location is in an awkward spot so just be careful in the drive-thru. It's very narrow getting out."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about this place. I think it must be a nostalgia thing for people that grew up on it. The chili is absolutely disgusting. It resembles canned cat food. It looks like it's been pre-eaten and takes on whatever shape and design is on it's lid, if you added cornstarch you could probably use it like play dough.  The burgers are very sub par and you get better fries in a high school cafeteria. My 3 year old wouldn't  touch any of her food after the first bite...and she  eats anything and everything.   Go to in n out, it seems like that's what their going for anyway. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the location is convenient."}
{"text":"Just like home in LA, this Tommy's doesn't disappoint! Chili cheeseburger with fries is the norm, although you can add chili and cheese to your fries if you can't get enough of the chili on the burger. Service was prompt and food arrived in a timely fashion. I couldn't decide if I wanted a chili dog also, glad I didn't get it, The burger combo was enough. Will choose that on the next visit!"}
{"text":"Very clean and counter personnel very nice. My child has allergies to wheat so we bring her own bun with us (gluten free). They toast for her :-) It's the little things like that and the great taste of their burgers that won us over! Love Tommys! Keep up the great work at the Craig Road Store Also wanted to add that one Friday night it was 1158 pm and I pulled up to the drive thru thinking they were open till 1 am for some reason. It was midnight and they served me with a smile and great food!"}
{"text":"The classic chili burger I grew up on. Always stop by when I'm in the area. Their french fries are always done perfectly too."}
{"text":"Being fairly new to LV Ive decided to try as many different resturants as possible. I ate at Tommys and, well, it was fantastic. Great customer service, the double cheese with chili was awesome, and the fries are like real fries, not those thin no taste ones. Oh, and for the price, perfect everything."}
{"text":"It's been a little while since I ate here, but I am just now getting to my review.  Me, and my wife both ordered their chili burgers.....absolutely disgusting.  I can't even fathom how anyone can eat that stuff.  The patties were super thin, and the Chili wasn't chili at all, it was more like a thick nasty paste.  The fries were also NO GOOD!!!!  As we sat eating, the only good thing i could comment on was my fountain soda.  My Coke was great!!!   I am reading these other reviews, and it just makes me sick to think someone out there actually likes this crap.  I think I could do better with canned dog food on a burger."}
{"text":"Digusting, gross, whatever adjective you want to use. Went through empty drive-through and I think the cashier was also the cook cause it toook awhile. He got my change right, but he forgot to fully cook the burger and the chili was a nasty mess of something brown and cold. I got lucky that I decided not to eat anymore after one tiny sample bite and also lucky that only $2.65 was wasted on a straight cheesburger. Oh yeah, I ordered no mustard and then the bun was soaked in yellow mustard that had been scooped out. Low-wage Idiots and bad food are a deadly combination at this dive. Call to corporate office has been made."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars because of both quality of food and service. I was immediately greeted and when one register was taking an order; another employee opened the other register to eagerly take my order so I did not have to wait.  The food itself was prepared promptly and tasted just like back at home!   My significant other is not a fast food/burger junkie like I am but does accompany me when I'm in the mood.   As my SO was patiently waiting as I was chomping on my burger, the manager came to our table and asked how everything was. What impressed me was that he must have notice my SO not eating and after I explained that he has never been to a Tommy 's, the manager insisted that my SO try some chili and brought back some complimentary chili cheese fries.  This type of attentiveness and generosity is how any or new business should operate. It is not about getting free stuff but letting your customers know you are aware and by standing behind your product by offering to a person who otherwise would not give it a chance or a second thought."}
{"text":"I know this place is supposed to be all about the burgers. But for me, it's all about the hot dogs here. The chili cheese hot dog, of course.  Sure, the chili isn't all that great. But it's above average. And when you put it on a hot dog, it gets 4 stars.  And there's no skimping on the chili and other toppings here. Don't even dream of picking up this hot dog and eating it. You have to knife and fork it. The chili is lathered all over it. It is awesome.  And when asked if you want everything on it, say yes. Don't question what other toppings they could possibly be referring to, just go with it. It all totally works and tastes awesome.  I've only ever done the drive-thru at this location, but zero complaints about the service."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate when a company expands into different markets and loses their identity. I grew up in CA and spent many a weekend night on the corner of Rampart and Beverly enjoying a chili burger and fries.   The name may be the same, but that's where the similarities end. Staff should be trained to know the menu and history of the company. The chili makes the brand and there was barely any to be found on the food, which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"The service was friendly. The hamburger was greasy and tasteless. The thousand island dressing was too salty. The chili was greasy, and I had to throw it away. I wasted my money here."}
{"text":"Did Pinkk's and Tommy's owner know each other? Chili is very similar but Tommy's Chili Cheese burger and Chili Cheese fry's WOW! Never been to the LA location yet :)"}
{"text":"Tommys is one of my guilty pleasures. My ex boyfriend and his family raved about it cause they grew up in california where the place originated. So anytime someone would take a trip to cali they would always bring back Tommys so I got to taste it a couple years ago. It was good but you can imagine it wasnt that fresh after being in the car for 4 hours! So when they opened up a Tommys in town I was super happy. The only downfall was it was all the way on the other side of town by St. Rose Hospital. I live in the northwest and am rarely on that side of town so I only had it once. They also have another location on boulder hwy but I never made it to that one. Luckily they ended up opening this location which is just off craig and the 95 and super close to my house! I am super happy that Tommys is so close to me now and I can indulge whenever.   I just love their chili. It does not have any beans in it and its spiced perfectly. I like it so much sometimes I go there just for the chili which they sell in to-go cups. All of their burgers come with chili,onions and mustard but if you dont like chili on the burger you can get it on the side or omit it completely and just get their burger \"cali style\" with thousand island sauce, lettuce and tomatoes.! They also have breakfast and tamales with chili of course! I almost always get the chili cheese fries and a burger cali style. Also as I said before you can order the chili on the side and get fries and make your own chili fries if you want to be thrifty! Definately check this place out it is worth it!"}
{"text":"The place is okay - I think they need to add Onion Rings to the menu but beggers can't be choosers. The food overall is okay but I still think In and Out is better."}
{"text":"So glad they opened this one!  It was a long wait to get one in Vegas then having to drive to the other side of town sucked."}
{"text":"Thank God they finally opened one up last year.  I used to have to speed to Barstow to get my hands on my favorite indulgence.  I remember following all the drama on the internet ever since I moved to Vegas.  With the delays and uncertainty it was well worth the wait and the drive from North Las Vegas.  I made excuses to drive all the way down there to St. Rose PKWY but now I end up getting to their second Vegas location more....the one on Boulder HWY."}
{"text":"I've been going to Tommy's since I was a baby in rampart, Los Angeles, it's amazing that they are able to keep the exact same flavor and food quality no matter which location you visit,  loooooove Tommy's!"}
{"text":"I love Tommy's And I ordered the Chile Cheeseburger with fries and a coke and it was all good."}
{"text":"Can you say 24 Hours of awesomeness? I use to live in Los Angeles and go to the Original Tommy Burgers and this location does not disappoint. I was so excited when this location opened up so that o was able to share the chili cheeseness with my husband .  Their food isn't the knock off chili like weinersnitzel . It's good stuff. I definitely suggest the chili cheese burgers with pickles.  As far as the service here, it's always hit or miss... I'm always worried about if they are going to get my order right or not because it has been wrong before (onions when there wasn't suppose to be) that's why I took away a star .   I love the fact that they have a drive thru and the fact that they are open 24 hours and their prices are pretty reasonable and so are their portions!"}
{"text":"I'm not in love with their burgers because I don't need chili on everything. So I get it without and it's a good burger. My husband on the other hand loves these burgers so much. We have been a few times since moving to this side of town and the service has always been amazing.  Tonight a younger girl named Jeanne was working the window and she was beyond friendly. We will be back because of the good food and amazing service."}
{"text":"As a transplanted SoCal girl this childhood favorite of mine has definitely helped with my homesickness by moving into Vegas. Burgers covered in chili, smeared with mustard and a thick slice of tomato under the patty. So delicious!"}
{"text":"first time trying and i would def go back. Service was great and the food was very good."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Tommy's! This place is the best. The chili burger is awesome. I eat here at least once a month. Love it."}
{"text":"Super greasy. Super fattening. Had to eat with fork and knife. When the food left the wax paper an orange puddle remained. The chili is fine ground grease paste. I am pretty sure I got my entire life serving of trans fat."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, you see a lot of billboards and a lot of places to eat. I spotted the 2.99 meal deal for Tommy's and I had to go. 2.99 for a Chili topped cheese burger, fries and a drink ? I'm down. As soon as you walk in, you feel like you've just walked into a in n out burger. The same tile, merch for sale on the wall, the historic photos on the walk, you just get that vibe. The menu is much bigger than in n out, so the choices are harder to make. I ordered my meal and sat down waiting to get my name called but I looked up to be surprised that it was delivered to me. She asked if I wanted banana peepers, I said yes and turned around to see she placed them on my table instantly. I wish I had cash to tip her but all I could of really done is smile and wave. Well actually I could of left her my number but let's stick with food here. The fries were extremely hot aka fresh fries. They weren't thin or steak fry thick, more of a Chilis, TGI Friday, Applebee style feel to them if I was compared. Chili and cheese should of been an idea for me but it slipped my mind. Animal style would of been perfect for them as well. The burger, THE BURGER, well want to talk about heavy and messy. Peppers, onion, tomato, cheese burger, bun and SO MUCH CHILI. You don't really taste the burger but the Chili with the veggies taste great. The Chili oozes it everywhere so don't eat this and drive because I would feel safer if you drank then drive then try to eat this messy burger. Personally, I love messy foods so I had a spoon ready to go. The food was great, the coca cola was SO fresh and the place was clean. The employees were super nice too. I'll probably be gassy later but I'll return for sure."}
{"text":"25 years ago I first met Tommy's hanging out at the corner of Beverley and Rampart in LA. A sprawling complex, with outdoor counters along the parking lot edge from which to scarf and people watch. They had been chronicled in the Let's Go California book, along with divey food joints like Clifton's Cafeteria and Oki, all of which I had to check out.  To be honest, it was that crazy damn chili that drew me in. Sure it is a vague barely tasteless substance, but I ate paste in grade school so perhaps it was nostalgia kicking in. The fact that they didn't do fries (only potato chips !) or dogs equated with a cheeborger cheeborger aesthetic that only a minimalist would embrace.  5 consecutive meals of double chili cheeseburgers later (including breakfast), I not only hadn't gotten sick, I still wasn't sick of Tommy's! Sadly, we returned from our road trip, saying goodbye to LA with our last meal being the famous Broasted Chicken at Knot's Berry Farm. However, I vowed I'd be back...  Well I never did make it back all those years, but now that Tommy's made it to Henderson close to where my parents live, the first thing on my list was to partake of that heavenly slightly congealed glop bathing two thin patties and happily slapped between a sturdy bun and a not unsubstantial tomato slice. It did not disappoint. My dad even licked his chops as he watched me wolf that thing down. Immediately after we went to In-N-Out so they could eat their unglopped burgers and I could only think to myself, let it not be another 25 years. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried here last night after seeing it from the 95 all the time. Pulled into the drive up around 9pm. Placed my order for 2 1/4 lb cheeseburger meals and one regular hamburger.   Got home abd ate dinner. The burger wasn't anything special but it was pretty good. The chili is a very simple chili with no spice to it but a decent flavor.   The fries were standard steak fries with very little salt.   What made the meal was the yellow peppers that I was offered with my meal. Those are what give the burger some spice and really made the food perfect."}
{"text":"I went with my brother, who had been wanting to try this place out, so I figured \"What the heck.\" I would give it 5 stars based on cleanliness, but I wasn't there to check for roaches. It reminded me of In-N-Out... Same set up, same colors, they even sell t-shirts and other \"souvenirs\" and such (same parent company, maybe?).  I'm giving it a one because the chili may as well have been (and probably was) grease. It was totally flavorless (I'm not sure which brand of canned chili they were using, but they need to switch brands, or add something to the mix), and probably needed to be stirred in the pot a little before it was served. I wound up with an upset stomach for a couple of hours, and felt like vomiting until I got home and passed out on the couch... And even after I woke up, I still wasn't right.  The burger and fries were pretty greasy, to the point that I could see the grease dripping off the burger, and the fries turning the paper they were on road-worker Orange. I ate the burger, but left about 3/4 of the fries (at about $11 for the meal, I'm at least going to eat the main part of it). And what's with the two and a half cans of chili on each, the burger AND fries? Don't get me wrong--I like chili cheese burgers just as much as the next guy, but with all that greasy chili, it seems like all I got was CHILI... And not good chili, but greasy, flavorless, heartburn-inducing, stomach-upsetting chili.  As we got in the car to leave, I decided that I would never eat at this restaurant again... At least not the one at this location."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Reminds me of when my childhood when my parents would take us to the one at LA"}
{"text":"I remember when this place finally opened here in Nevada. I no longer had to wait to go to California to get a Tommy's hamburger and was super excited. So chili is what they are known for, its a very specific taste if you compare it to other chili burgers.  Their taste is unique and that is why the secret is so guarded.  This time I ordered via drive through, it was a very busy time. Only two guys were  working but service was prompt and friendly.  I do like that they use gloves while preparing food.  My only complaint was that there weren't enough fries compared to other times."}
{"text":"Heard what a \"GREAT\" burger could be had at Tommy's. What am I missing? Meat (?) patty was paper thin and tasteless, cheese was greasy (tasted like velvetta, yeah I know, but some people call that cheese), chili tasted like paste, tomato was not ripe. Oh wait..the diced onions were GREAT ! ! The staff, English obviously being their second language, had the personality of garden slugs. Then there is the even more obvious flaw. The location sucks, being tucked in the corner of an afterthought of  a parking lot. There is practically no parking near the front door. You have the empty  location of the previous BUZZ BBQ where people can actually see you and park close to the door that would have been a better choice. Actually Tommy probably did us all a favor hiding this horrible excuse for a burger joint where customers are not actually tempted to spend their hard earned money. Do yourself a favor and SKIP IT."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast Burrito's.  They used to be open at 7am now they are not open till 8am.  Usually only catch them on the weekend because I eat breakfast earlier.  But Great Breakfast Burrito. Wish they were open earlier!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Definitely not as good as the California chains. The chili didn't taste the same and was a little bland. Service was fine but the food wasn't up to par. I haven't tried the location on St. Rose but prolly won't be coming here."}
{"text":"Horrible! I was craving a chili dog and noticed on yelp that this place was around the corner from my house and was supposed to be famous for their chili so I hopped in the car and ordered the chili dog combo with chili cheese fries. I will say the young man working there was very nice but when I got home I noticed my fries were devoid of chili which I would later be happy about. I opened up the chili dog and took a bite and promptly threw it in the garbage. The \"famous\" chili tasted like unseasoned squished beans and had the texture of tooth paste. The only edible thing was my fries and the little peppers they threw in the bag. Save your money because this place makes weinerschnitzel look like fine dining."}
{"text":"I always order the chili cheese fries with a side of yellow chilis and it's super delicious! I usually just go through the drive thru and personnel are always friendly. They don't take Amex so that sucks just (Visa or MasterCard, fyi)"}
{"text":"I just moved to this side of town, so I've been wanting to hit up different places to eat. I went here around 9am because I saw that they were open and weren't selling solely breakfast foods. The staff was nice, the quarter pounder cheeseburger tasted great.. Just one problem. When I unwrapped the yellow sheet... No chili cheese on my fries! I paid an extra $2 for that service. Extremely disappointed. I was the only patron at the time, too. I will give this place a second chance one day, but I will check my bag before leaving or dine-in."}
{"text":"I grew up on Tommy's back in LA . I moved to Vegas from Hawaii and I was super happy to find Tommy's here in Las Vegas , a piece of home . If you like anything chili this is your spot"}
{"text":"What can I say except I became a convert to Tommy's back in my SC days when we would make the midnight run to the original on Beverly and Rampart in LA.   Although the frequency of my visits has diminished quit a bit, the loyalty remains. Tommy's is so unique that it stands heads and shoulders above the rest. It's all in the  chili. But...Tommy's is like the Dallas Cowboys...love or hate them but no middle ground. I happen to love their chili.   This time around I went with the Number 1 combo-double chili-cheese burger, chili fries with cheese and raw onions, side of chilis and a Coke.   Came in hankering for a for chili bomb delight and left satisfied."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy low calorie meal, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a high calorie melt-in-your-mouth comforting need twelve napkins and a new shirt now chili burger, park the car, you have arrived at your destination. Tommys is one of those places where you just have to put the food in your mouth, not analyze the way it looks. You don't think about what's in it, you just chew, and give your tastebuds the ride of their life.It's one of those places where, when you're having a bad day, you go to and say \" I'll have a chili boat, tamale, dog, burger and what ever else you guys can put under there.\" You stuff your face, try to gather all the chili that's escaped on to your clothes, and sit and enjoy the wonderful food coma Tommys has provided you with."}
{"text":"Tried this place once before when it first opened, wasn't too impressed. So 2 years later decided to try it again. When I say it was less than average, I'm seriously understating myself. I ordered in the drive thru, terrible experience. Finally after some work, got the order put in. It was a simple order. Hamburger with no pickles, cheeseburger with chili and one side of fries. Got to the window, the cashier finally shows up, re reads my order back to me and took my payment. 12 minutes later my order was handed to me out of the window. I was already irritated about the wait, and didn't check the order. Got it home, I love .06 miles away, and the fries were cold and soggy. Both the burgers had chili, which was so cold the orange grease had set in on it. Unfortunately I will never return to this place. I hope they change the way they do business, because it was a hideous experience with food that was worse"}
{"text":"I love Tommy's, in California that is. I was at the drive through with no other cars around noon on a Saturday. I spent 30 minutes in the drive through. I just drove away, luckily i didn't pay yet.  I would have liked to support this place and give it business but this was the second time I recieved slow service so no more support from me. Canes is right next to it which was a perfect option, if not, better."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after hearing a co-worker rave about it for years. I ordered a #2 combo (cheeseburger with chili cheese fries and a very large cherry coke) and a small chili for my chili loving daughter. Cost $15  After about a 10 minute wait in the drive through (no one was in front of us) we finally got our food. The chili was a clump of cold gel smashed into a container looking and smelling like dog food. The same nasty chili covered both my burger and my fries. We both gave it a chance and were not able to eat more than a few of bites. About 10 minutes later I had to make a quick restroom stop.   Summary: overpriced nastiness with a side of food poisoning. I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Tommys makes our family happy! This is one of my husband's favorite hamburger joints! We grew up on Tommy's. He love's extra chilli, I enjoy light chilli. My go to order is the number 3 or a tamale. I am grateful that we can share these memories of Tommy's with our children!"}
{"text":"Really the most average meal I've ever had. Not good, not bad. I gave it a two because technically a 3 is above average. It deserves a 2.5. The chili is pretty odd, I think I would have enjoyed it more without the chili."}
{"text":"Seemed like new employees who didn't know how to charge an order correctly. Got rung up for combos when we just ordered the burgers. And thought we wanted a single when we said triple. Manager/shift leader worked it out for us but just kind of ridiculous. Then the guy who ordered before us waited forever for his food. This is supposed to be fast food. Only reason I put 2 stars is cause the food was still delicious, when we finally got it. Don't get me wrong, tommys is delicious but I prefer some decent customer service."}
{"text":"I usually go to Tommy's about once a week to get food for my boss.  And i occasionally partake in the feasting of  burgers or dogs.  I mean can you really go wrong with chili standard on EVERYTHING!  One thing I can't recommend however is the \"Tamale boat\" my toilet paid dearly for it couple of hours later.  The whole day with Muddbutt didn't help either.  The fries are crispy and the dogs are awesome.  One day ill build up the courage to try one of there ginormous breakfast sammiches.   Go there, or ill punch you in the face."}
{"text":"I ha e loved Tommy's forever.  One if the most iconic So California burger places. The best chili cheese dogs  I have ever had, and I have had a lot. The chili cheese fries are awesome as well. But the big secret.... try the chili cheese tamales.  WOW this is heaven in your mouth."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll start by saying to be fair, the two staff members I interacted with were perfectly nice and helpful and the main \"dining area\" was clean, but god damn the food is soooooo gross, and it's very expensive considering how gross it is- over $3 for a crappy cheeseburger that's more sauce than burger and over $4 for the most disgusting chili cheese fries I've ever had. I love chili cheese fries, I get them everywhere! The fact that I 1) couldn't finish them, 2) didn't want them to go and 3) didn't even consider taking them with me to try to give to someone else and instead just threw them away cuz they were so gross is really, really, really saying something!  And the bathroom, which I used after I was done with the super gross excuse for food, was also pretty dirty. The place was totally empty and there were no cars in the drive through (it's a wonder anyone would come here for a repeat visit as there is much better and cheaper stuff in the same area), and the two staff who were there were nowhere to be seen. It's not fair for me to say they were \"doing nothing\" just because I couldn't see them, there is a now hiring sign up and they could be catching up on shit or something back there. but it's definitely not a good look on your business to have only one customer around and your customer toilet seat looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a week, especially when your \"food\" is also super disgusting.  I feel so ripped off, almost even scammed, and I wish I could get my money back. This place seems like they are trying to be in-n-out, which I guarantee you is far superior to this place regardless of how you feel about them. To charge the prices Tommy's does for such garbage is criminal. What a huge waste of money."}
{"text":"this is a good chili place if you are from California and now living in Vegas.  I will be back due to the quality of the food.  The people that work there are nice and make it easy to dine in.  The place is clean and smells so good when you walk in.  Get the number 1 with chili fries everytime ask Johnny to hook it up and make sure you get extra napkins"}
{"text":"The $2.99 combo is a full size meal and doesn't  cost extra. Fabulous price and food."}
{"text":"All Chilli and no dog... Not like the ones in LA at all!"}
{"text":"I'm from Southern CA, so I was expecting the same great burgers I grew up with.... Fail. Meh. Bleh. Blah. The bun was so stale it felt like eating thick cardboard. Thin, dry, icky meat patty. Honestly, the hamburger patties at McDonalds look and taste better. I like the fries, nice and thick, but there was zero salt or seasoning.   I would only come back here to satisfy a random french fry craving, but I'll need to grab some salt packets."}
{"text":"Nice surprise! Was looking for something new but quick so we decided to give it a try. I love when they toast the bun and the edges are crispy not soggy! Fries were crispy on the outside and still had some potato left on the inside and not too salty. A super nice touch was real chili peppers offered as a condiment. What?!?!? Window attendant asked if we wanted ketchup or chili peppers. I'm like.. Ok yeah a few of each. My husband goes \"what are chili peppers\" I'm all. Don't know..curiosity took over. 6 real fresh green chili peppers. Awesome!! The chili was spicy and a bit greasy for my preference but was enjoying everything too much to notice. Will definitely be going back and recomending my friends to try it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for comfort food, then this is the place to go. I wanted something other than jack in the box so I saw Tommys burger and decided to try it out. I ordered the chili cheese burger and chili cheese fries. Presentation was like in n out. Burger and fries come in an open face box. Chili cheese fries were good. It wasn't outstanding - just standard chili and American cheese. The burger I was a little scared to eat because of the chili. But as soon as I took a bite into it- I could taste the freshness of the beef patty and tomato. It was great!   Overall:  Burger 4/5 Chili Cheese Fries 4/5 Would I come back? Yes- if I'm looking for some good comfort food then this is my new place to go."}
{"text":"This was probably the biggest waste of money I've spent all month. The chili was not chili. It was a disgusting paste that somehow is supposed to pass for chili. It looked and tasted like they took the beef from Taco Bell, mixed it with some pudding, some flower, and some water and smashed it onto the food in such gross amounts that it completely overwhelmed anything else. I was excited about chili food. Huge huge HUGE disappointment."}
{"text":"First time here and I got the mega combo. I was very satisfied by the meal, I like extra cheese and they gave me plenty on mine chilli cheese fries and burger! Was very delicious! Only thing I didn't like was the parking and it's in the corner in the back. But a great place to sit down in and have a meal."}
{"text":"We just landed and my son wanted a burger that was easier to get to and not in a casino or the Strip.  It turned out to be a good choice.  I didn't really hey put chili on everything and it was way more than I should consume.  I  like the chili and will have that on its own next time."}
{"text":"I will bet the hospital next door could make a better burger and fries. They claim to have cheese fries. Yeah they are fries with a piece of American cheese melted on top. Fries cost $1.95and cheese fries cost $2.95. Save your money and eat at the hospital."}
{"text":"Chili burger is very good. You cannot get a burger like this anywhere. Yes it's greasy and that's how a chili burger should be. Fries are very good. Breakfast burrito is good with chili on it."}
{"text":"I'm just it a fan of the chili. Its just not good. I've had better chili cheese fries at Weinerschnitzel's. I always wanted to try it after seeing it all the time off if the 95. But now that I've been there and tried the food, I don't think I'll be going back...ever."}
{"text":"FANTASMIC!  5 stars are not enough.  It would be foolish to say that there's got to be something wrong with anyone who doesn't flip over these cheeseburgers, wouldn't it?  We all have different taste.  Well guess what?  There's got to be something wrong with anyone who doesn't flip over these cheeseburgers.    One way to order them: Chili and cheese only, extra chili.  And, if you're in the mood, extra cheese.  It's American cheese which is perfect.  For those of you who've never had the fortune to try a burger, know ahead that the chili is not the kind you'd eat with a fork, or spoon.  Well, I would......but....  It's very blended and yes has some bright orange oil from the ingredients, and so be it I say!    A little embarrassing, but do admit, I actually make noises reflecting my appreciation with each delectable bite.  This place should be far more crowded all the time, as it is in Los Angeles.  I wish they would advertise and show video clips of the line at the Los Angeles east L.A., maybe get some fans to rave.  When a Californian, friends and I would drive to original even when it was considered a rather dangerous area.  These cheeseburgers are phenomenal!  I've heard of people having these at their weddings, and it's a great idea.  Go enjoy. And don't forget...chili and cheese only, with loads of chili."}
{"text":"World famous??? Really? I gave this place a try.. Again.. But nothing changed for me. I still was disappointed when I tasted my meal and after leaving. The chili just doesn't look very appetizing and tasteless. The burger patty is a standard as thin as can possibly be and your frozen fast food burger. The most flavor was the pickle and mustard together. The fries were ok. I enjoyed them more than the burger."}
{"text":"With all the rave about Tommy's, I was pretty surprised to walk in on a Tuesday at 6pm and see the place pretty much dead. Can't say enough about the staff though, the whole crew at the counter was really nice and friendly.   I like spicy food so the Caliente was calling my name. For starters, the chili is friggin delicious! It's ridiculously greasy but it is tasty and I'd go back just for chili cheese fries. The burger patties are super thin and when I tried to taste the meat by itself, all I could taste was the toppings. On the Caliente, it only comes with one patty so I felt like I was eating a chili sandwich with onions and peppers. They do have really good buns though so that's a plus.   Maybe my mistake was not getting a double or maybe even a triple burger. It may sound like a lot but the patties are so thin and I just couldn't taste the meat at all. They have a couple things on the menu I'd really like to try, especially the tamale and their breakfast. Even if just for the chili though, I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find a Tommy's while visiting Henderson.  What a delight as it brings back memories from the original on on Roscoe Blvd. in the San Fernando Valley back in Los Angeles.  The recipe and menu here is the same.  The classic Tommy Burger with Chili is the staple.  The chili is more pasty that others but is the right amount to hold all the ingredients together.  Not too much and not too little.    For those who never had a Tommy Burger before the other staple is the tomato.  Thick wedge cut slice is their signature.  I think it's a nice crisp cold balance to the heat (temp) of the chili.  My ranking of burgers is: Hamburger - In & Out Chili Burger - Tommy's Cheeseburger - Fatburger Pastrami Burger - Big Fat  Cash and cards accepted.  Clean run joint."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers, pretty quick service. But the fries were soft and my daughter only ate 2 bites of her hot dog due to the poor taste. My husband didn't say anything, which is unusual if he really likes something. Great service though no matter what! Overall, I would go there to order a burger, but not the fries."}
{"text":"Great service, bad food. Really friendly crew but I found their \"chili\" (which was more of meat paste) bland and kinda gross. Will not return."}
{"text":"The best classic-style chili fries in town! Fries are made fresh to order so they stay crispy even when enrobed in their delicious chili sauce. Be sure to get some chiles to squeeze over them for some extra kick.   Staff is nice as always and the dining room is clean."}
{"text":"Tommy's is one of those places you either love or hate.  I grew up eating Tommy's in Los Angeles and is one of my favorite comfort foods of all time.  Tommy's may be my top pick for last meal - definitely top 3.    Tommy's is all about the chili which is more like a greasy, thick, beanless, chile con carne.  My standard order is double cheeseburger, no tomatoes, extra chili and a chili cheese fries with onions and extra chili.  I always load up on the jalapeno peppers.   Sometimes I get no burger and two orders of chili fries.  Also the breakfast sandwiches (which come with chili, of course) are delectable.  This location serves decent shakes which I don't believe are available at any of the Los Angeles locations I've ever visited.  Please note the standard burger comes with chili, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and mustard.   This was the first location to open in Las Vegas - and outside of California for that matter - and that was a very happy day for me (not for my pants).  This is the only Nevada location I've been to and it's very clean - almost sterile."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a burger joint back home where they serve chili burgers as well. I tried the cheeseburger with chili and the hotdog with everything on it and the hamburger was the better choice by far. Price was nice and the fries came out crispy and it was very reasonably priced. Also it seems that this location the line is non-existent so it's good for quick in and out grab. Way better choice then McDs"}
{"text":"So delish, the best chili, yummy tamales, good fries. It's just like being home in California. Actually it taste better than it does in Calif. And it's so nearby too."}
{"text":"Decided to try Original Tommy's after hearing many positive comments about the concept of a burger with chili. I ordered the double cheeseburger with chili. It was the regular size burger not the optional quarter pound patties. The sandwich with trimmings includes tomato and pickles. Here's a tip. Do not unwrap the sandwich as the chili will drip all over. Just fold back the paper and enjoy a juicy and tasty mess. The chili has great flavor and a little heat. Also have some extra napkins nearby. Ordered the regular french fries and the order was large enough for two people. The fries were hot ,crisp outside, fluffy inside and not greasy.   The restaurant is bright and clean. Orders are placed at the counter and you receive an order number. Service was friendly. On this day our wait during lunch time was very short and the food was delivered to the table. A choice of refreshments are self serve.  The chili is also available in various sizes to take home.  Overall, Tommy's offers a another good choice to satisfy a burger craving."}
{"text":"This place was gross. I was expecting a regular burger and ended up getting some slop between bread. We bought seven people dinner and not one of us could say anything good about it. We did eat it because we were starving, but I will never come back"}
{"text":"Ultimate munchie and then lay in bed the rest of the night food. Would always go to the one in Barstow growing up driving tonL,A, and this one is just as good."}
{"text":"I've been to several Tommy's locations in So. Cal., this location is not anywhere near their efficiency. That said, the food quality was virtually identical, it simply took quite a bit longer to arrive."}
{"text":"I used to drive from the bay area to la just to go to a Tommy's. When they opened the one in Valencia, I was so happy. It would take an hour each way off the trip. When I was going to Las Vegas last week, I did a search to see if there was a Tommy's on the way. I found that there was one in Barstow and Palmdale. I could stop at either one of these on the way there or back. Then I noticed that they had one in Henderson, Nevada. Since I was going to go to Hoover Dam anyway, Tommy's was on the way from Las Vegas. Well, I had my first order of a chili dog and chili fries. I only went back for a second round though. (Normally I will go for a third round of a chili fries and chili tamale.) The chili at this Tommy's was kind of a let down. I don't know if it is this particular Tommy's or if it was just an off day for this one.  Every single time I have been to any of 14-15 different Tommy's the chili has been exactly the same. It doesn't matter which location, time of day or day of the week. It is just good ol Tommy's greasy chili. This time it was lacking some of the flavor. It still had the grease, it still had the color and it even had the same consistency of baby diaper diarrhea. It was just missing something."}
{"text":"What a waste of money. Ordered last night got a double cheeseburger with chili on the side. They gave me a single burger so thin I was eating practically just bread and Tomato. Chili looks like sludge and taste gross. And my cheese fries barely had any cheese at all and it was basically a piece of sandwich cheese microwaved on top of it. What a waste was completely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I definitely wouldn't call this fast food, but good food is worth the wait, right? I have only been to one other Tommy's location, but was pleased with the food so when the Mrs. said she could go for a cheeseburger, it was a done deal. The burgers were very good, and cooked AFTER we ordered them. I could see them cooking from the drive through window. Eventhough there was only one car in front of us and it took a while to finally get our food, I didn't mind the wait. The burgers are worth it. I did, however, go without the chili, simply to avoid a mess. What brings me to only tack on three stars is the location. I knew where it was and still had a hard time finding it. I seriously thought I was driving through EZ Pawn. Trying to navigate through the drive through kind of reminds me of the final few seconds of a roller coaster or log ride. I thought for sure I was going to scrape on one side or the other. It's so bad, they've put out caution signs and hung them on the fence. The same fence I thought I was going to drive into. Junior, who was working the drive through, was very friendly and the order was spot on. I just can't get on board with the location. I will make a return trip in the future to get the full Tommy's experience with chili on my burger."}
{"text":"I used to drive 45 min to get this classic bit of Americana and now there is one two minutes  from the house. My arteries are in trouble..."}
{"text":"What kind of place is this? Order chili on a burger and when you get it, the chili looks like it was SLAPPED!! on the burger like someone back there didn't like you, a sight that makes you lose your appetite. Paper thin hamburger patties and in my case the tomato was the highlight of the burger. Tomato slice about 1/2 inch thick, the burger pattie? about 1/16th of a inch thin. Saving grace, the fries are good if you eat it there. Take it to go and they wilt and get soggy. There is a better Tommys about 250 miles away in California. This place is a disgrace."}
{"text":"So, Does Tommy's here compare to the Tommy's in LA? Ummmmm... Sadly NO!!! Being that Tommy's originated in LA and I am very familiar with their food I was excited to see Tommy's but was disappointed. I had the chili cheese dog and was underwhelmed. Unfortunately, Tommy's will not be a place I will frequent. Oh well... C'est la vie!!!!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!! FINALLY! This location has been set to be a Tommy's for a longggggg time, but I guess there was an issue with the billboard being too close to the building or something. Who cares why it is open now!!!!!  There isn't much parking directly out front of this Tommy's (there is handicapped parking) however this Tommy's shares the whole parking lot with the rest of the shopping center and it isn't a far walk at all. If you are a true Tommy's fan the few extra steps wont kill you and since you are likely to be eating chili here you can use those few extra steps! There is also a drive-thru. It appears that because the drive-thru has little space that they only put in the few spots up front to detour accidents and want customers to park in the shared shopping center spaces.  It didn't surprise me to see this place packed when I walked in. There was a long line of hungry customers. I got in line while hubby kept an eye out to snag a table. The girl who took my order was very friendly and repeated my order to make sure it was right. I then made my way to fill up our drinks while the order was being made and grab some good ole Tommy's napkins. The napkins here are more like paper towels and necessary when eating here!   The food was ready and I was ready to dig in! I ordered a #4 \"Chili Cheese Dog, Fries and drink\" priced at $8.55 after requesting my drink be a large and adding chili, cheese, mustard and onion to the fries. Yum! I had to cut the chili dog in half and share it because it was hearty. The fries were delicious and held up the chili and other toppings perfectly. Hubby ordered the \"Caliente Burger Combo\" and gobbled it up. Our friend ordered a \"Chili Tamale\" priced at $3.25 and he really enjoyed it. We left very full and satisfied!   Anybody who has been to the original location at Beverly and Rampart knows the nostalgia that goes with that location. There will never be another like it, but we can certainly be thankful to have a location right here in Las Vegas to go to and make memories. Thank You Tommy's for branching out of California and making your presence in Nevada!     \"If you don't see the shack - take it back!\""}
{"text":"Went for the first time and have been a return many times. If you like good chili on a hamburger and your fries this is the place."}
{"text":"So glad we don't have to drive to Barstow to enjoy Tommy's anymore!   We love having a Tommy's here and the new \"Caliente Burger\" is delicious!   The only thing is the location is hidden behind St Rose Hospital so I don't know how many people know it is even there. They do give the employees at St Rose Hospital a discount.   I can easily eat just an order of \"Chili Cheese Fries\" for a meal but if you have a bigger appetite you can order the \"Mega Combo\" priced around $10.  They serve Cherry Coke!   The inside is very clean and the employees are friendly.  There is a drive-thru."}
{"text":"not as good as the originals in los angeles for some reason.  but it definitely hits the spot if you're craving something greasy and heavy after a night of drinking....closes at or before midnight though"}
{"text":"All I can say is they have overpriced cheap tasting chili burgers. If you feel like cheap chili, discomfort, and just edible food, definitely the place for you. Not the worst burger place but definitely down the list."}
{"text":"i ordered fries with extra cheese and my friend ordered her's, we waited over 40min or more for fries, a hotdog and hamburger. they threw out my receipt and forgot us. then they apologized and still took long, so long i asked for my money back but they said no your order is almost done. i got my fries and barely any chili, i told them i asked for extra and the cooks called me a bitch and were talking about me like i was not there!!!   so 1. they threw out my ticket 2. made me wait over 40min skipped us  3, didnt get my order right 4. called me  a bitch and said i was rude  i wasnt rude i was annoyed and hungry and simply said if they can put the extra cheese liike i asked!   if you go to this tommy's get ready to be disrespected by the cooks!!!"}
{"text":"Can't ever go wrong with a greasy tommys chili cheeseburger.  Opted out of getting chili on my burger and got the side chili boat instead.  This location rocks!"}
{"text":"Amazing food as always and very courteous and friendly employees! This is my favorite place to eat on the planet so every time I  come to Nevada I have to get some. :)"}
{"text":"Very greasy and not very good. The chili is just there, no flavor and just not good."}
{"text":"Growing up in LA, I was lucky to have In-n-Out and Tommy's. Outside of LA, everybody knows about INO, but not so many know about Tommy's. Chiliburgers FTW!  Their chili is made the proper way, without beans. It is the perfect topping for burger and fries. I don't think I would try it on a chocolate shake though... ;)  Tommy's burgers are really good and since not as many people know about them, the line is shorter than INO."}
{"text":"So mad I just wasted my money here. Ordered double cheeseburger meals with chili cheese fries for me and my son. They are so bad my son refused to eat any of it after the second bite and I gave up after the fifth bite. Idk if it was the batch but the chili was BLAND literally had no flavor and had the consistency of school cafeteria chili yuk! Ended up throwing our food away it would even be disrespectful to give it away to someone on the street seriously it was that bad. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Not quite the world famous hamburger that I was expecting. I'm a bit surprised that they bill themselves as \"World Famous\" because I had never heard of this restaurant until last year (from Yelp)----- but only decided to give it a try today. I was surprised to learn that they've been around since 1946. Their famous chilli on the hamburger tasted more like watered-down refried beans (where's the meat?). This really was not a good combination (it masked the taste of the hamburger patty). The employees seem friendly. At least I gave this a try."}
{"text":"Simply put, too greasy for my tastes. My wife and I were the ONLY customers in line.  I asked for my hamburger to be served with no tomatoes , and no pickles. Yup, served with pickles and tomatoes. All though the meal left me full, I have had much better hamburgers, and much better service."}
{"text":"Tommys is the ultimate Los Angeles burger shack. Don't expect fancy and don't expect the chili to be like anything you've had before.    This is a place LOVED by LA folks for 50 years, but you have to understand what you're getting and not have your notions of what they should be.   The chili is thick, tasty and unique.   Order this ...  Chili fries with cheese, extra chili and any burger, extra chili.    Get a fork and a friend and enjoy!"}
{"text":"It turns out hamburgers and fries IS rocket science.... I ordered a burger and fries and asked for ranch.  I drove off and reached into the bag to stick my hand into a boat of ranch.   The employee literally placed an open boat of ranch in the bag! I ended up with ranch inside the bag all over the front of me but no ranch to eat!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Tommy's if your craving that good old gut bustin chili cheese experience! Visiting any and all locations for 35 years now, nothing can satisfy quite like Tommy's when you need a chili fix!"}
{"text":"The place say's World Famous, so maybe i was expecting too much.  The burger was a good size and cooked well, the chilli was ALL meat (no beans) which made my burger even bigger.  Bought a bottle of the peppers and they were really good also.   Overall i liked this place and if one was in Phoenix i would probably go quite a bit!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to Tommy's Burgers when I lived in So. Cal, so my trip there on New Year's Eve was my first experience.  A limited menu, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Basically it's a question of just how big you want your chili cheeseburger, because let's face it: you don't go to Tommy's for anything else.  My double cheeseburger combo was around $7.00 - with a large drink!  (Oh, big bonus here - they actually brew real iced tea, none of that syrupy crap.)  My take-away order was ready before I was done fixing my iced tea - everything nicely wrapped up in yellow paper.  Nothing sloppy or greasy about these chili cheeseburgers.  When I got home, I was impressed.  The fries were tasty, and meaty: no skinny, crunchy fries here.  Golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy and light on the inside.  The burger was really tasty too.  The chili is a very thick, meaty concoction with lots of chili flavor, but hardly any spice.  The burgers are served with tomato, onion, pickle and mustard in addition to the chili.  I know it sounds weird, but it works.  The location is a bit hard to get into, but I imagine they'll do a good business from the hospital and nearby offices.  All in all, not the best burger I've ever had, but definately different from anything else here in Vegas, which makes it a welcome addition to the drive-thru listings."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a 1 star review but I was borderline sick to my stomach by the time I got done eating. And that is still after eating maybe a quarter of my food. Im not sure if I got a bad batch of chili or what but the taste was horrible!! I was hoping that maybe with this being my first time maybe I needed to take a few more bites to really appreciate the flavor. So, I attempted to choke down my meal and couldn't do it. I literally almost CHOKED!! I highly doubt I will return to tommys but if i do I wont be eating anything with the chili!!"}
{"text":"We'll I was interested in trying a new burger and after driving by this place a few times figured I'd give it a shot.  Ordered a single chili cheeseburger got a regular cheeseburger.  The bun was soggy from the tomatoes and possibly the pickle as well.  So I took those off and it went down, pickles were the most memorable thing about the burger, pretty sad.  Also got the chili cheese fries or so I thought I got a Shyte colored paste resembling well diarrhea but thicker and pastier if that is a word."}
{"text":"College nostalgia has set in!  Remember back at UNLV when we used to drive to Cali for the weekend one of our stops would be Tommy's Hamburgers along the way.  The chili!  The grease!  The calories!  The tummy ache!  Crazy tasty!  I've been waiting for this Original Tommy's to open for months!  It is literally only minutes away from my humble abode.  Even though I am close, I choose to visit Tommy's on a non-regular basis.  Maybe only once or twice a month.  Read the board at Tommy's and you'll see why!  Yes, they post the caloric contents for their items...just like the ones in Cali.  So, so bad.    Yes, Tommy's is hit and miss with many folks.  Some swear by it, the meat, the cheese, the fries.  Others are totally lost on the concept.  Why is there chili on everything?  Why you ask?  Because without it it's not a Tommy's burger.  The chili is what sets them apart.  Come on, you go to McDonald's and wonder what to eat?  Most times you'll end up with fries or chicken 'McNuggets'.  You just do.  Same at Tommy's.  Just do.  By itself the chili is just OK.  It's got some spice and taste, but it ain't pretty.  Oh no, not pretty chili at all.  It is akin to something you might feed your beloved family pet, I'll give you that.  But it's subtle enough that it works on almost everything on Tommy's menu.  Burger with chili.  Yep.  Fries with chili.  Yep.  Hot dog with chili.  Yep.  Breakfast burrito with chili.  Yep!  It adds some substance to an already greasy meal!  Please folks, don't come to Tommy's if:  1)  You don't want chili on your items 2)  You are on the HCG diet, or the Slim Fast diet, or the \"I don't eat anything with a face\" diet (you folks have obviously never had a rare ribeye before)  Do so and you will be greatly lead astray.  Tommy's is oily!  Greasy!  Will stick to your ribs!  And any other limb you are trying to tone up for that matter.  But hey, it's supposed to be!  Sometimes folks just wanna be fat, and enjoy eating that way.  I myself try to find a 'normal' balance somewhere in the middle.  I love fancy meals, sure, but I also love down-home cheap eats too.  I'll give almost all of it a whirl just to broaden my food perspective.  It's what good Yelpers should do!    So, if you are a beginner here at Tommy's I suggest you tread lightly.  If you do a burger or chili here (you don't have to say \"with chili\" because it's basically automatic), don't do chili on your fries.  If you do the fries with chili, don't do a  burger or hot dog with chili (which you will have to say \"no chili\" because it's not automatic).  Do too much chili at one time and you don't have an iron gut?  Be prepared to hit the throne.  Hard.  It's a lot of food for one person!  Initiate yourself into the chili concept gradually.    \"I rarely have a chili burger, but when I do...I prefer Original Tommy's...\"  Stay healthy, my friends!"}
{"text":"They burgers were taseless and the chili tasted like........well what it looks like....."}
{"text":"The Los Angeles CLASSIC makes its way out to Vegas, I was so excited when I stumbled across this one afternoon.    Tommy's is a great place that can only be enjoyed by those suffering from the deadly sin that is gluttony. Their burgers are huge, laden with cheese, chili, and whatever else you want to put on them. It's messy and it will fill you up fast.   If you can finish a Tommy's burger, you're a real man. Not even Chuck Norris can finish a Tommy's burger.  Just remember, \"if you don't see the shack, take it back!\""}
{"text":"Visited a friend in the hospital and this was right next door for good reason. My wife and I are both are sick to our stomachs after there nasty burgers. Chili is really alpo dog food I think. I hope they cover our deductibles if we have to have our stomachs pumped. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"the best chili cheese fries on earth!  yes, the chili cheeseburger and chilidog are great, but the chili cheese fries w/onions are epic! oh, and don't forget to ask for the free little hot peppers on the side... they are HOT!  geez they are hot!!  that chili is so thick a fork, knife and spoon will stand up in it.  get lots and lots of napkins and treat yourself to their sloppy eats... chili cheeseburger, chilidog, chili cheese fries and a soft drink."}
{"text":"I visited Tommy's after being referred it by a friend. After going on a long hike we decided some burgers would be a great meal. Boy was I wrong. Tommy's is only able to get one thing right about their food. What is it? Their Chili Cheese fries. No, not the entire part of it. Just the chili. Their semi decent chili is their only talent. Chili Cheese fries? Slap a square of packaged cheese onto these horrible fries and there you go. Now onto the cheeseburger. Apparently they think it would be a great idea to write in the smallest font that all burgers come with Chili. Wrong. My friend's burger was drenched with chili oozing out of the sides and making a huge mess. Why not include right next to each meal that it comes with chili. Is it that hard? I caught it just at the right moment to get a plain cheeseburger. I was served an overlooked bun that was way to crusty around the edges. And in between that? A patty so thin I was wondering if there is even meat in there. Once again another greasy cheese slice slapped in between the buns and there you go. Worst cheeseburger I have ever had. I will be eating somewhere else. Upon leaving I caught a glance of the drive through. Is 800 feet before you reach the first window really necessary?!? Maybe you should focus on the food instead of the drive through. I will be looking for a better burger joint in the future."}
{"text":"SoCal has arrived only 10 mins away! The best of the best is here. I would have to travel to east vegas to get my grub on now just a few mins away. Fresh chili cheeseburger. ...chili cheese fries...and the best coca cola...I kno its just soda but it taste so good here. Good service.  Very happy!"}
{"text":"Oh Tommy, oh Tommy, you have let me down!  I have been patiently waiting and waiting for a Tommy's up on my side of town.  I have been watching the countdown for the new store on Craig to open for months now.  I was so happy today when I saw on Facebook you were finally open.  My heart was all aflutter and I couldn't get over there fast enough to grab a ridiculously messy and oh so good chili cheese burger and fries.  And then it went downhill...  First, the location itself is tucked into a corner of a big shopping center.  There are only 3 parking spots near the restaurant.  Otherwise you have to park and walk across the entrance to the drive thru side which had a lot of cross traffic.  People were driving all sorts of crazy in this area, so be careful walking around here since there really isn't a clear path to walk on.  I actually had to do drive thru today because my kiddo had fallen asleep on the way over.  It is easy to get into the drive thru, but really tricky once you have picked up your food.  The driveway is very narrow and quite close to the building.  I drive a mid-size sedan and it was tight.  I feel bad for anyone is a big SUV or full size truck.  Pay attention or you might hit the wall.  Next, the order taker.  She was really quite friendly, but was on the pushy side.  I needed a second to review the board to know what to order for my daughter to eat later.  I asked to have a minute to check the board.  I think I got maybe 15 seconds before she was asking if I was ready to order yet.  There wasn't a line, so I am not sure why she was in such a rush.    I went ahead and ordered and then she asked if I wanted to upsize my drink for an extra $.50.  I said very clearly, \"No thanks\" to which she said \"Ok.\"  I assumed that meant I would getting a regular sized drink, silly me!  I get up to the window and she hands me a large soda, which I was totally charged for, so it wasn't just a mistake by whoever was serving up the sodas.  I told her I said a regular and she said she thought I said to upsize it.  I wasn't in the mood to argue, so I just took the drink.  I mean I love soda and can easy drink 2 liters in no time, but I am trying to be good and cut back on my soda addiction.  So much for that!  It was just fishy, in my opinion.  I don't know if the girl really made a mistake or wanted to improve her up-sell totals.  So watch out for that trap.  Next was my burger order.  I ordered a regular chili cheese burger.  I specifically asked to have no onions because they are yucky.  The girl told me that they only put onions on burgers if you request them.  I said great and to please keep them off of my burger.  So you can imagine my surprise when I got home, having been drooling over the burger next to me for the last 3 miles, and then took a big bite into my burger that was covered with ONIONS.  Ugh.  I have never seen so many onions, it was almost like i got an extra helping of them.  Fun times for sure.  So after I took a bite into my onion infested burger, I had to take a big swig of my giant soda to wash the onions down.  Guess what?  The soda mix was totally off.  I mean the place had been open for 2.5 hours by the time I was there.  How was the soda to syrup mix already goofed up?  So yes, I paid extra for gross soda.    On the positive side, the burger was super tasty (once I picked all of the onions off) and smothered in delicious Tommy's chili and cheese.  The fries were simply amazing! I have no shame, so I scrapped all of the extra chili cheese off of the paper they were wrapped in. Yummmm, cheese paper.... If you haven't tried a Tommy burger, you really need too!  I still love Tommy's, even after all of the messes listed above.  I am giving this location the benefit of the doubt and giving them 3 stars.  It is their opening day, so maybe everyone is working out the kinks."}
{"text":"I am thrilled this Tommy's location is finally open.  It has been a long time coming.  Despite a rather crappy location being behind the rest of a shopping center and visible from the street after driving past, people who are in the know and support such an historic piece of SoCal culture will keep this burger joint open hopefully for years to come.  It is a little strange driving under a low lying and quite large billboard when going through the drive-thru.  And it is equally strange being in a long and narrow drive-thru along side a flood channel.  But the product within this strange complex is what I know and love as the Original Tommy's.    I usally get the same order when I go.  I get a double cheese burger with everything.  That is a burger with two meat patties, cheese, rib sticking chili, a thick slice of tomato, diced onion, pickles and mustard.  Add some regular fries to scoop the chili drippings off the paper and you are set.  Some times I switch up my order a bit and get a chili tamale.  This is a tamale with chili and all the other fixin's from the burger.  It is almost every bit as good.  Worth a try.  If you are a breakfast person, try their burrito.  The last time I had one I had a BOGO coupon.  I ate the first burrito and had to save the other for lunch.  They are that big."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. It was okay. Not enough cheese and their single patty burgers are so small even with lettuce and tomato. Customer service was great. The woman was much helpful. But if i ordered from there it'll have to be a really big meal. Pricing wasn't that bad. Typical for a fast food joint. They need more selections for beverages though"}
{"text":"A nice fast food place that overthrows Wienerschnitzel's effortlessly.   I ordered the double cheeseburger with chili fries and I'm currently experiencing food coma. The patties were much leaner than something you would get at mcdonalds and rivals In-n-Out. Good price for the food. I like!"}
{"text":"Very good for the craving of cheese, chili and fries.  The only drawback is the entrance of the location. But once there the service and nice and friendly.  The food is always fresh and the whole purpose of eating Tommys burger is the grease. Old fashioned chili and cheese goes with everything!! Glad they are in Vegas."}
{"text":"My family and I went to one of their location in henderson, when you look at the menu everything looks good, so we order 6 double cheeseburger and chilli cheese fries. the chilli looks like a clay and the cheeseburger was very disappointing. in n out burger is 100 times better."}
{"text":"The chili so totally overwhelmed the DOUBLE burger. And the chili was like a meat paste. Not happy at all with the fries. Chile cheese fries had NO cheese. Didn't get our order right. Ordered chili and got chili fries. Won't go to this place again."}
{"text":"Finally after 2 years of waiting I have a piece of L.A close to my home here in Vegas. What can you say its Tommys... That distinctive taste is still there the only reason I gave it  4...... getting in and out is a pain in the ass bad bad location."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.  I attempted to eat their signature chili cheeseburger and barely made it halfway through.  I am morbidly obese and typically eat anything that is in front of me.  I felt obligated to eat as much as I did just because it was so damn expensive.  The cheese was generic processed kraft singles.  The chili.  Ugh, the chili.  Its not even really chili. It tastes like dehydrated astronaut food.  Its texture is horribly chalky tasting.  This was seriously the most foul tasting food I've ever had in my life.  Though, comparing it to real human food is being much too polite.  I would give this zero stars given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Nahhhh.  So, I was so excited to come here and try their burgers, buuuuuuuut, total let down.  Maybe it was my fault, I didn't want to get one with chili on it. Oh well.  The burgers are small and expensive and the fries were the only thing good. The drive thru is a death trap!   I guess I expected more for how much we spent, but we will def not go back. The drive thru cashier was a sweet Hispanic woman, and thats why I gave this places 2 stars!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas for 5 years and have always wanted to try this place. Recently I've been seeing commercials for tommys so I decided to go. I ordered 2 number 2s one with chili one without & both without tomatoes. I ordered it exactly like that and it was like I ordered a math problem for them to solve. It took forever to get our food. Once we got it, we weren't given our drinks and it took them forever to realize that as well. We get home open our burgers. Both had chili and one had tomatoes on it. Our experience aside the food was not great. Chili was greasy and tasted like what I'd imagine wet dog food to taste like. Fries were limp and not crispy. Will not be returning to tommys."}
{"text":"I was soo excited to try this place after seeing all of the good reviews. I ordered a California burger with chili cheese fries. The burger was pretty much all veggies, the meat was so thin it wasn't even noticeable! I don't think you could taste the meat if you got a double that's how thin it was. Still ok. NOW on to the chili cheese fries...I just want to know WHY everyone says these are the best, this chili is soo flavorless it's not even funny. & greasy. Don't get me wrong, I loveeeee greasy food! But this was just disgusting. I couldn't even finish it. I don't think I will be back"}
{"text":"I just ordered and had to drive off before paying and getting my food. What kinda place puts a rat trap right next to their register window outside for customers to see. Wtf"}
{"text":"Yuck. Actual hamburger was paper thin.  Chili was very greasy. Customer service was great. But I I'll stick to in-n-out."}
{"text":"The only difference between tommys burgers and McDonald's is the fact that there's chili on all the burgers. It's very underwhelming. Fries are terrible too. Chili is less than mediocre, but the service was really good. However, I wouldn't recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Love love love Tommy Burgers. They are the best hands down of all burger joints. Eat the best and forget the rest. So glad they are expanding east. I drove all the way from Arizona to enjoy this delicious meal."}
{"text":"For a place that's all about chili burgers, the chili is bland. So is the beef but I still like what I got. I would have liked this burger with out the chili. Good news is its an inexpensive 50's style diner."}
{"text":"If this was the location on Rampart in Los Angeles, 5 stars would do it.   Seems that they are lazy out here for some reason.  Fries have never been fresh. I have to ask for extra crispy just to make sure they make new batch.  Chili burger is good but not with the same love that the L.A location puts into it.   I come here only when im truly craving a chile burger"}
{"text":"Complete asshole.. 11:26 November 29,2017 the guy charges me extra for large without asking me, does not ask me if I want ketchup closed the window on my face... never go back here again"}
{"text":"We have a place back home in Warren,Ohio, Called simply, 'The Hot Dog Shop', that is the 'Go to Place' for MILES around, for anybody that is looking for a quality Hot Dog, or Burger, But the Big Draw for either item is the Chili that is smothered on top! For over 35yrs I have yet to have find a place that could even come Close to the Taste of their Chili! Until Last Night! When I finally decided to go to Tommy's. Now I have seen this joint sitting kinda lonely behind an iron fence, on the corner of Craig and the 95 since their opening and would think to myself  \"I Don't think that's such a good Location\", and not because of where it's at, (It's Actually an eye popping location) but because of the accessibility. Well.. I did the venture through the drive-thru with no hassles or complaints to find myself perfectly situated for an easy exit back onto Craig. Then came the big moment when I was home and able to bite into the First Burger that took me back to my childhood years, Wow, Simply Amazing! You know the saying \"If you Build it they will Come\"  Well, they made it and you should Go!"}
{"text":"Never in my life have i been more uncomfortable eating at an establishment as i was tonight. A woman showed up not on the clock to i guess hand out paychecks or something. She was walking around the kitchen area with no hairnet or apron or gloves or ANYTHING touching everything and commenced to tell the on duty employees what was \"wrong\" and \"unsanitary\" while we were sitting there about to eat our food. Then she walks out and sits down with her children and other people while the employees then bring her a BUNCH of food that she didnt pay for! What type of establishment is this well known franchise running. Last time ill be eating here."}
{"text":"Went here with my two sons, got 2 burger combos, overpriced at nearly $16 dollars!  Milk was $2!  Workers were friendly, place was spotless, very clean and very empty, we were the only customers at lunchtime!  Boys didn't care for the food either...won't be back."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in tonight after seeing one of their specials posted on Facebook (Tuesday $1.99 Chili Dogs). It was our first time trying it after many years of driving past on the highway. It was delicious. The place was clean, the staff was polite and courteous and the order was  served quickly. We will definitely be going back to try more of their menu offerings, thank you."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and didn't know if we would like the chili so they offered us a very generous sample.  We decided not to add the chili to the cheeseburgers but they were wonderful without it.  We asked for \"crispy\" fries and they were hot and fried to perfection.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Will go back again....and again."}
{"text":"Excellent employee named Joeseph showed me the ropes, I am hooked. Great food prices and employee!! I will be back!!!!  Not a great location but manageable."}
{"text":"If your from Cali. You know this already...Famous Tommy's burger is the best! I don't eat here all the time but when I do I devoured it in a sec."}
{"text":"Got a great discount at KSHP.  Two combo meals for 7-bucks.  For both meals I ordered the chili cheeseburger combo's.  I was impressed by the size of the burger but not impressed with the taste.  In my opinion, a chili cheese burger should not have pickles on them.  I had to dig those out.  The chili is pretty bland and did not help the burger at all.  With the combo meals I upgraded one of the fries to chili cheese fries.  The fries alone were very tasty, I prefer thick cut. The chili did work on the fries when the right amount of salt was applied.  I plan on visiting again but next time get a regular cheese burger and stick with the chili cheese fries. The overall experience was good!  Even without the deal, the prices are very reasonable and that must be one reason why people enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I had to visit Las Vegas for work. had to get a bite to eat and stumbled upon Tommy's. We don't have them in my neck of the woods and I had to stop. Ordered their classic Double Chili Cheeseburger, fries and a coke. The double is a meal all by itself. The steak fries were piping hot and were a good vehicle for the chill that slipped off of the burger. The beef patties are small and get overwhelmed by the chili. I walked out happy."}
{"text":"the service and food here is soo bad. im from cali and i was here on vacation i was craving a chili burger like back home.  so i went here and i so regret it! all i ordered was two chili cheese burgers i was the only one in drive thru and i waited 20 mins for my two burgers. i was on my break which was very unpleasant to not be able to enjoy my meal since it took so long i had to up and go back to work as soon as i got my burger. i asked kassandra who was the cashier what her managers name was who was on the phone behind her. her name was vanessa. i think vanessa needs to be retrained on how to manage her shift  i shouldnt have to wait 20 mins for two burgers and im the only  one in the drive thru! i will never be back to this location !!!"}
{"text":"Love me a good chili burger and this place delivers! Its kind of like the super secret menu that you WISH In N Out had! These guys even have great fries... with or with out being drenched in chili and cheese.  I do wish it was open as late as the ones in California, but at least its here and just as good as I remember it!  (You hear that Chick-Fil-A!!)"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Cheeseburgers  are great but messy.   Parking is awful.  But food is very good.  We had excellent customer service.  The other reviews are accurate."}
{"text":"Admittedly, Original Tommy's does not top everyone's list. But I am a LONG time fan and I LOVE that they are here in Henderson!!  Food is always fresh to order, chili is always amazing!! Staff is very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Hell yes.  It's Tommy's, if you don't get it, then that's too bad.  I don't get White Castle/Crystal's personally, but others do.  Double chili-cheese burger with extra pickles and chili-cheese fries and a coke.  The best part is that it is more consistent than even the big chains.  If you blindfolded me and took me to different locations I would not even notice."}
{"text":"LOVE Tommy's, I just wish they'd hurry up and get the Craig Rd. Location open!"}
{"text":"SO disappointed!  Got a burger combo today and while the fries & soda were good and generously portioned the burger was messy, lacked flavor and didn't seem to be made of a quality meat.  I won't return."}
{"text":"Place order in the drive thru at 146pm its 206pm and still waiting in the drive thru... two cars in front of me, one behind me. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the burgers but their chili cheese fries are okay. My boyfriend loves the food here but I don't. Customer service is great but the shake machine was down for a bit and it took them awhile to bring my shoe out to me but it's okay. 4 stars cause the food was hot and fresh plus customer service was good."}
{"text":"Living in california it was easy to find. Just far enough from the shopping areas. Food was good. Not as good as the orginal in Los Angeles. Overall Not bad, not even crowded for being lunch time and the hospital is even right next door:-)"}
{"text":"While the service is friendly, the food is EXTREMELY greasy, and with the speed it's prepared at, it makes me wonder if it's all pre-cooked. The burger quality is not very good. The chili is not flavorful at all, and is just loaded with grease... The cheese they use is just sliced processed crap, sadly...   The parking lot is nigh impossible to get in and out of, and their drive-thru is a pain in the ass to enter too. I'd only give it one star, but every once in a while a greasy burger hits the spot. Just... not that often."}
{"text":"They shouldn't put new employees in the drive thru. Had to repeat our order 5 times. Who doesn't know that when you order a hamburger that means no cheese."}
{"text":"I have been a Tommy's addict since I was about 7 years old growing up in Southern California!  The joy that I felt when Tommy's finally branched out of Southern California and opened up 2 locations here in Las Vegas cannot be measured in words!  Tommy's is by far the best bad food I have ever wrapped my lips around.  Their hamburgers hold their own, but it should be a crime to come in here without getting chili!  The flavor that Tommy's captures at every store is something that I have yet to recreate after hundreds of attempts to make my own at home.  The prices are stellar:  A hamburger, fries and soda are right around $4.50, and the hours are nearly around the clock (they used to be 24 hours, but unfortunately the Henderson folk haven't discovered this gem yet).  I tell everyone I know about Tommy's and I have yet to hear a bad review from a friend that tried it.  My only hope is that they open one in the Southwest (Warm Springs and Durango if anyone in Tommy's management reads this!).  Great food, great flavor, great prices!!"}
{"text":"I mainly come here for their chili. Love their thick style chili. Hot dog is just blah, but if u smother it with their chili and cheese it's delicious. The sliced tomato they put on the hotdog always seems to be dry or overly ripe so it ends up in the trash. Usually I'm pretty satisfied with my order. Most recently not, due to the fact that they forgot to put cheese on my chili cheese dog and chili cheese fries. Spicy, yellow hot peppers on the side go great with the meal."}
{"text":"I like no extra charges for ANYTHING pickles, pepper, onions etc."}
{"text":"Dear Tommy's Thank you for moving nearby. Although I am still waiting for Pink's Hot Dogs and Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles I appreciate you coming. It's been a while since I had you. I had you tonight. In my mouth. You felt amazing with your doublecheeseburgerness and chili and onions going down my throat. I felt your fries crispy and soft inside dipped in chili goodness.  WHAT FREAKIN TOOK YOU SO LONG? DO YOU REALIZE I WORKED OUT TODAY AND YOU HAD TO BE HERE! ARGH!  But thank you again for bringing your heavenly chili to my ass. I really really do like you. I miss your taste in my oral orafice. Thank you for coming back. I will see you again soon. Yes...real soon...  With all my heart,   Myke  PS. What's up with your parking lot? Did white people design it? Its so confusing."}
{"text":"Great to have a burger in Vegas that reminds me of eating in the Valley! As good as the original and just as messy."}
{"text":"Tommy's on Rampart was an important part of getting through final exams when I was a student at the University of Southern California.  40 years later (yikes!) I still get the cravings and am so thankful Tommy's came to LV.   A double cheeseburger w/o onion, and with extra chili, is my go to standard, and yes, I still slip in a couple of those hot yellow peppers. Thank you Tommy's for continuing to serve the best, greasy, drip down your arm chili burgers and chili dogs.   Now, being able to buy the chili to go means fewer visits, but more cravings are satiated."}
{"text":"Very clean inside, surprisingly empty for a Noontime visit.   I've driven by a couple times & finally decided to stop today & see if they had a veggie-burger.   They do not, which I found to be rather surprising, since based on the decor, they follow the Five Guys/In & Out/Freddy's school of thought (& all those places do have a vegetarian option).   The order taker was very friendly & wanted to be helpful, but it was obvious that they don't get asked for veggie burgers much.  She suggested a cheese sand which & it turned out to be pretty plain, but OK.  Their burgers might be great, but as a vegetarian. & with all the other options around, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I only go here if literally everything else is closed or has long lines. The people who make the burgers always cook them until they're past well done. I tried to go here to get breakfast once and was literally sitting at the drive thru speaker for 15 minutes and no one answered. I don't see them staying open for very long."}
{"text":"Old lunch place to go since the 80s. Chili on the burger, hot fog, and fries alwayd good. Tried something new,tamale with chili...not wrapped in a leaf. Different taste, more on the dry side. Not a bad thing to try."}
{"text":"I used to go to to the Original location since it's not far from where my brother lived but haven't had it in years.   The chili is this gloopy greasy mess that makes me think, \"why am I eating this?\" but yet I enjoy eating it with fries. I have a thing for thick cut fries, this nice inbetween steak fries and regular cut fries and they serve it up here.   I got a burger but since I had chili cheese fries already, I got just a classic california one. It was \"meh\". The balance was all off....what I mean is the patty was thin, then theres thick tomato slices, lots of lettuce, etc. I like when things are a bit more proportionate. The BF got a Caliente burger which was better.  When we ordered they messed it up and rang us 3 burgers, two classics and the clientele. When we told them, they refunded our money for the extra burger, but told us to keep it. I took it home and the pugs and cat split the cheese and meat patty.  I can see on the rare occasion I want that radioactive chili on fries coming here, but it's not something I really think I'll be visiting often. There are other burgers out there I like better."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place stays in business especially being this close to the hospital. After eating here I'm sure you'd want to check in to St Rose and check your pulmonary status as I'm sure your breathing will be slower and I'm sure your heart will be a little more clogged. The fianc√© wanted to try this place for the first time. I've heard a lot of bad things from family and friends so I figured i would just try his. The paper alone from the chili burger was dripping in oil. The chili on the burger looked like thick sludge. I know looks can be deceiving but the burger had no flavor and the chili didn't taste like much but I was grosses out even taking the two bites I did. If I would have had a whole one to myself I would have had an ulcer or worse I'm sure. The two bites I did have left me with the worst stomach ache I've had in a long time. I don't know how people enjoy this food or worse actually enjoy it. Never again! If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Sorry Tommys's not one person in my family of 6 liked the food.    Didn't like the chili, shakes, fries.  Hamburgers were just plain. Nothing spectacular.  Would never eat here again. Kids said it was a waste of my money. And they usually don't care if it's my money getting wasted."}
{"text":"If In & Out Burger & Fatburger and Steak & Shake had a kid in some sort of bizarre chain restaurant fiasco, Tommy's might be the result.  Service almost as fast and conscientious as In & Out, but the burger is fresher and juicer.  More like a Fatburger, but not quite.  So between an In & Out burger and a Fatburger you'll find Tommy's.  With good chili from Steak & Shake.  If you've never been to In & Out or Fatburger or Steak & Shake you should go at least once.  Or not.  As you wish."}
{"text":"Love these burgers! We used to go there when we lived in California. Brings back memories from when we were kids! We love their chili. We were very happy that they opened some locations in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have definitely had better than what this place has to offer.  First of all, the default hamburger order includes this substance they call \"chili\" on the hamburger patty.  I think I would call it more like a mixture of tomato paste, bean paste and some sort of disgusting unknown ingredient.  Needless to say, I took about two bites and left the meal at the table for the staff to deal with.  I ordered a second burger, this time without the chili.  It was mediocre at best.  The fries were decent, however.  Had my experience with the second order been outstanding, I would have given this place a solid three stars.  I can't give them anything better than that, as my experience with the chili was too disgusting.  I would not recommend stopping in at this place for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Why? Why had I not done this before? That was awesome. 5 Guys Burger (at least for now) is a close second. It was the chili. Made all the difference. It was pasty, greasy, spicy awesomeness. Now for some satire. I'm so happy they posted the calories for each item. As if that matters! Ha! The days caloric intake has been completed in one sitting. An apple is in order for dinner. I will return."}
{"text":"The people that have left bad reviews don't realize the history behind this historic burger chain. Its not cheap, combo with chilli cheese fries is about $10 but I've been eating at Tommy's since I was a kid. Tommy's has been in business for over 70 years, they must be doing something right. You can only get Tommy's is Vegas and Cali. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"It's an LA classic.  Show up hungry or else you'll never come close to finishing all that chili topped goodness.  It will sit in your stomach for a while, but a great post late night drinking.  They only take cash or the charge a fee to use your ATM card.  No credit cards."}
{"text":"Craving beef! I ordered a triple cheeseburger with quarter pounder patties, grilled onions , no pickles, thousand island style!  Hit the spot perfectly. Taste great if you add salt and pepper!  They got my order wrong the first time though and had to go back. But the remake was on point."}
{"text":"They lie. They don't have chicken. They're trying to sucker you in. Don't patronize liers!!! It'll make Yelp useless."}
{"text":"I've passed by Tommy's on St. Rose a few times but never had the time to give them a try until last night.  I ordered the #1 combo (Double cheese burger w/chili, fries and drink) at the drive thru. Service was fast and friendly and the food was served fast and hot.  Let first say I like chili, chili dogs, chili cheese fries, etc. and have had them at many places and occasions. However, the \"chili\" they put on this burger was just terrible.  From the pictures on the menu you would expect to see a meaty traditional looking chili. What they serve however is a brown sludge that resembles refried bean paste more than any chili I've ever had. The best I can describe it is like they took a very mild generic canned chili and added another can of refried beans and blended all the texture out of it. It was greasy and bland with no discernible meat flavor I could taste.  Luckily most of the goo had smooshed out the sides of the burger and I was able to salvage a fairly good tasting double cheese burger from it. The rest of the burger wasn't bad. A flavorful combo of 2 flat top grilled patties, cheese, diced onions, tomato, and mustard. I got it without pickles.  The fries were hot and crispy and rate better than average among fast food fries.  I may go back to Tommy's again as I thought the burger was pretty good, but definitely will not get the chili on anything. I see all the reviews on here raving about the chili and I guess it's all a matter of personal taste. So take my opinion for what it is but I thought it was just gross."}
{"text":"So the food they sling and bank on the fact you'll get hooked when you have your first bite is one heart attack from a triple by pass... and???   They make no apology that their food is about 500 calories... PER BITE!  And I dig that!    Meat, chili, and carbs... this is the place if you're into that kind of indulgence.  Giddy up!   4 stars for the food, minus 1 star for the health factor."}
{"text":"Its Tommy's, what else do I have to say? If you grew up in Southern California you know what I'm talking about. If not, give them a try... if you like old school drive-in style burgers and fries you won't be disappointed. If you have a weak stomach this probably isn't the place for you. But it's damn good either way."}
{"text":"In the words of Jimmy Fallon, \"They are so Ewww!\"  I have given them 2 tries and I'm still not a fan.  Their burgers are not suitable for human consumption, unless you enjoy slop on a bun."}
{"text":"Burgers are great tasting and dipping fries in chili is a nice change of pace than cold ketchup, the food is ALWAYS piping hot. Also during peak summer this place actually has the ac on a comfortable level when many other businesses try and save money having their customers sweat in 85 degree indoor temps."}
{"text":"My husband saw this restaurant on a list of \"burger joints you wish were national\" so we gave it a try when we were on our way home from the M.  I guess we didn't realize that Tommy's \"big thing\" are chili burgers.  The restaurant was pretty empty so service was quick.  It was clean, although it seemed \"bare\".  The fries were nothing special, and I hoped they would be because I didn't really like the burgers.    I guess you have to be a chili person... and I'm just not."}
{"text":"40 year Tommy's customer says NO MORE!  I have been a customer of Tommy's for 40+ years. While the last few years the price continues to go up, today was the last straw. Tommy's has already been that great nuclear chilli place to eat. Food was never stellar but its chilli and fries.  Today was my last visit to walk into Tommy's.  I ordered a Double 1/4 pound Chilli Cheese burger with everything. Order of Frys with Chilli (No Cheese) and a small drink..  $13.53????? Are you kidding me. For food this is more of a guilty pleasure and never all that good, I am priced out.  Tommy's use to be great when it was less expensive, but at this price I will might as well eat at Fatburger or Fudruckers. The food is a hell of a lot better.  Sorry Tommy's, it's time to learn your place and the price is NOT right here any longer. It's been a fun ride....."}
{"text":"This is the most disgusted I've ever been eating at a restaurant. They had a HUGE roach just crawling around. It literally crawled up my fianc√©'s leg. A worker came out swept it up and threw it outside like if nothing happened. I've been here a couple times in the past but won't be returning. I don't need to wonder if that's only chili on my food, or if it's roaches."}
{"text":"I have a weakness for their greasy chili covered double quarter pounder cheese burgers, they're so good and tasty, nothing really compares to them, all you really need is a handful of napkins and everything is O.K.! I have been eating them since the 1970's in Los Angeles and am happy that there is a Tommy's close to home. They have had a consistently good burger for all these years and I'm happy I've been a customer of theirs. The store on Craig is a good one with kind and personable staff with a clean dining room. A+"}
{"text":"Chili on everything.   Your reaction to those first three words determines whether you should visit Tommy's.  Their standard burgers and dogs are topped with chili, onions, pickles, mustard and a slice of beefsteak tomato. But mostly chili. Good luck eating these without a fork and knife.  I prefer the dogs to the burgers. But really, it's all about the chili. I love me some chili, and this is definitely the kind that's intended as a condiment rather than as the focal point of a dish. But for what it is, it's pretty good.  They do promos on Facebook and Twitter like 65 cent chili burgers on Tuesdays. Can't complain about regular prices considering the size of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"WHOA!!! I honestly think that they planned out putting the Tommy's within walking distance of the hospital for a reason. If you read the small print under the meal deals it says, Free EKG with every order...   I have never had a chili burger prior to this and to be honest i don't know that I will have another one after this. Now, don't get me wrong, i do not think the food was horrible but the entire time I was eating it I felt like i needed to apologize to my body for inflicting this upon it. The chili was like paste sticking all the way down my throat and it was sooooo heavy, i felt like crap when we left.   I'm not sure if this Tommy fella is still alive and kickin, well.... Actually... I am pretty sure he can't be if he discovered this chain, i mean; really? Is there anything else you could cover in chili and processed cheese.  This trip to Tommy's was my hello and fair-well to the world of chili burgers."}
{"text":"Chili tastes like some cleaner got into it. Charged a large automatically and took a few bites of the breakfast burrito that fell apart in my hands. I know it's known for burgers but don't put me down on a simple burrito."}
{"text":"I've been on a chili dog and frozen yogurt bender lately.  Not so good for my health but I love it.  The chili dogs and burgers here are my favorite.  Note that I would not go here for just a plain burger.  The hot dogs are not as flavorful as others in town but it is tasty.  Plus, the dogs here have that unique casing that snaps when you eat it, making it even better.  What sets this chili dog apart is that they put the same toppings on as they do with the burgers and it is delicious, and can only eaten with a fork and knife.  On this one was mustard, onions, tomato, pickles, and chili.  If I want any of these toppings at the other locations I have to ask for it, and a lot of times pay extra.  Out of all the chili dogs I have eaten in town, this is not only the best tasting (and probably the worst for you possibly), but also the best priced out of all of them at less than $3.00."}
{"text":"Tommy's is the ABSOLUTE standard when it comes to Chili burgers, Chili dogs, Chili tamales, and Chili fries, and has been for over 50 years. Millions of people in Cali love this food. If you ever visit LA, Just go by the original Tommy's location on Beverly and Rampart at 2am on a Friday or Saturday note and be amazed by the long line of customers snaking for blocks away.  And as for you fans out there that think \"the best of anything\" needs to come east of the Mississippi, fogettibout it, Tommy's is the best!"}
{"text":"Love love love Tommy burgers. I have since I was a kid spending summers with my dad in soCal. Finally made it down to this location to try their food and here's my take:   Food: 3 stars Ambience: not factored (used the drive thru) Overall experience: 1 star  What we ordered: -1double cheeseburger combo no chili -double cheeseburger no chili -1 double cheeseburger combo no chili -Double cheeseburger no mustard extra onions  What we received: -1 double cheeseburger combo WITH chili -SINGLE cheeseburger no chili -1 double cheeseburger combo WITH chili -double cheeseburger no mustard REGULAR onions  Food: really close to what I've known and loved but far enough away to get 3 stars.  1. The chili is what makes a tommy burger and this was definitely off. It was so freaking thick it literally did not move. It was gloppy and almost pudding like in texture. I'm used to it being a little more runny and loose. But the taste was definitely the same great taste I've loved.  2. There wasn't enough chili on the burger (maybe that was a good thing since it was so thick) 3. Onions were not put on the chili. Everyone knows the onions go on the chili so it's kind of stuck there in each and every bite, not placed on the other side so it can fall off every time you pick up your burger  The only good thing about this was that the chili was so thick it was easy for the hubs to scrape off since his order was all messed up. The son actually liked the chili so the mistake on his sandwich was a-ok. I really needed those extra onions on my cheeseburger, that's a deal breaker for me.   Would we return? Yes. Actually going back tonight. But they really really need to get it together - I suggest to listen to your customers and make sure all orders are sent out correctly."}
{"text":"One of the worst burgers I've ever had. I used to go to the ones in California and this was no better.The chili is gross , tasteless and bland. It's like a tasteless greasy orange bean paste similar to Jack in the box tacos , only they have flavor. An orange grease come running out of the chili..and if you're not really crazy about the chili..well guess what they smother all your food on it. It is heartburn inducing stomach churning slop. The burgers themselves are the thinnest patties of frozen texture meat. Real cheap. I will never eat at another Tommy's again."}
{"text":"If you like greasy food this is your joint! I love the chili I like to call it crack bc once you start eating it's hard to stop I drive clear across town just for the chili cheese . My only complaint is that here's not one closer to my house. Please consider downtown summerlin for your next location ."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating at Tommy's. We will never be back. The food is gross and the service, well let's just say, I can see why they had 0 customers in there during dinner."}
{"text":"Helps to know Spanish here as in English the order usually goes wrong.  Burgers are good, but shakes and fries are mediocre.  Good chile goes well w/dogs, burgers and fries.  Not up to par with L.A. Tommy's but good for the munchies and when in a hurry."}
{"text":"Haven't had Tommy's in forever! So glad I found one here in VegasGreat super indulgent burger joint. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. Best chili burger and chili fries around. Ordered the double and could not finish it. Pickles are always crisp the tomato is thick sliced the fries are always hot and crunchy the sodas are always popping . yummy place"}
{"text":"Not bad not bad! Was here after a church service Wednesday night. This place was empty and usually is, so it nice there's no long wait. It's also real clean. I got the double cheeseburger which had chili on it! Their food overall is not bad but it is a little too fast foody for me. Some of there stuff is good like the chili dog but the hotdog is super cheap... If they fill it with a good dog it wouldn't be the typical fast food place. This place gets three stars because it's not terrible but it's not great. I'd go again but not a lot."}
{"text":"We heard great things about this place from friends.  We decided to one night, and first of all, their A/C must have been broken, because it was hotter inside than out.    Their menu is easy to order from and they have good prices, but the food.....is not good.  Mainly, it's their chili.  What is that crap?  It's pasty and a strange color, and has no beans in it, and no real flavor.  It's a very strange compliment to a burger or chili dog.  Speaking of chili dog, shouldn't their \"chili cheese dog\" have cheese?  Well, theirs doesn't have enough that you can even taste it.    On a positive note, the vanilla shake was great and the actual hot dog they use is high quality.    If it weren't for the strange, disgusting chili, the place would be alright.  I can't recommend it."}
{"text":"A few of my customers & a few people I work with rant about how good this place is.  I guess a lot of them grew up on this place in cali. To be honest the food wasn't good. The chili didn't have a taste at all and I'd rather of got chili out of a can from a store and put i on my burger and fries. Sitting there with my girlfriend l, as we both ate we looked at each other and pretty much both said Wiener schnitzel had better chili. I'm giving it a 3 only because the service was good and place was clean but it would of got a 2 star if the service was also bad."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and hot dogs. Maybe a little too much chili. Makes the hot dog bun too mushy too fast and then you have a really big mess. Next time I will just order the chili on the side.  No more problem. Service was Excellent!!"}
{"text":"They claim their hamburgers are \"World Famous.\" Famous for what, exactly? I ordered their #2 which is a cheeseburger and fries with a soda. I chose not have the mustard on the burger but everything else. I took out my debit card and they explained that there was a .69 cent service fee to use my debit card? I was fine with that, however, every fast food chain I have been too doesn't charge a service fee for their credit/debit transactions why is Tommy's the exception?   If they are famous for sub-par liquidy chili and wafer thin hamburgers, then by all means they are KING. Their food is by far the worst fast food I have eaten. Their chili is like liquid. Their hamburgers are so thin it almost looks nonexistent.  I have eaten better chili at a school lunch room. I would have much rather have gotten Wendy's chili and put in on a burger.   There was no saving this review. I can't even find words to describe something I liked about this place.   \"World Famous' you say? I can definitely see what you are famous for. BAD FOOD."}
{"text":"I am from los angeles so you know I am a Tommy's fan baby! Chili cheese burgers, chili cheese fries, milkshakes, mmmm yummy...enough said I guess it is a west coast thing. I went to the grand opening a few years back when they opened in vegas finally, that is how excited I was for the chance to once again savor some chili and cheese goodness. Got Towels?"}
{"text":"This place is good.  It's not In-n-Out and I'm not a huge chili fan but it was a good burger.  The chili cheese fries were crispy and good."}
{"text":"Tommy's is great because they smoother everything in their signature Chili! I mean who does not love chili on their fries? Hot Dogs... etc.... Personally, anytime I have a craving for chili cheese fries, you can better your last dollar I will be heading over to Tommy's..... That and it's real close by my house to.   Mind you, this place is not exactly for the \"health conscious people\""}
{"text":"Decent burger but underwhelming chili. The chili should be the star of their signature burger, and it was more like an afterthought. The burger was OK, but  I wouldn't rush back.   There is no easy access to the restaurant from St. Rose, which is a deterrent.  I had to drive through the hospital parking lot to get here. Doh! The yellow peppers were very good, they added a lot of flavor to the burger."}
{"text":"Tommy's hamburgers are amazing !!!  I have been eating them for 20 yrs. a visit to la- a must stop!!! It is a Southern California institution !!!  10.0-- chili cheeseburger- I normally get 2 doubles. With chili and cheese and mayo. Simply great. Just perfect flavor and taste and fresh ingredients. You know you been to Tommy's when you see the yellow and white wrappers.  10.0 -- chili cheese fries- fresh and tasty. Their chili is amazing!!!"}
