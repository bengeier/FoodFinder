{"text":"Great Breakfast Buffet - delicious made to order omelets.  Variety of Cereals, juices, fruits and veggies to add to omelets. Great customer service - we can't wait to return next Summer!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Made reservations for outdoor seating but nothing available without a considerable wait.  Drinks arrived promptly but then waiter did not return to take our order for an extended period of time. I ordered soup and salad but never did receive my salad. The corn chowder soup lacked seasoning. Asparagus was over cooked and the general presentation of the entrees and asparagus was visually unappealing. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Tomato basil soup was a little chalky but the pork chops were great! Two fellow diners absolutely did not like their salmon..said it tasted \"old.\""}
{"text":"We stayed at the Westin during our stay in Scottsdale and were short on time, so we decided to eat here for lunch. They gave us complimentary grilled flatbread with a garlicky, lemony hummus like spread which was phenomenally good. I would have been happy if that was all I had for lunch.  After I ate almost the entire basket of flatbread, I moved on to the special of the day which was their new york strip steak on ciabatta bread.  The steak was a little over done and tough for me, but it was still tasty because it was covered with cheese and topped with sauteed onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers. It was served open face style over a slice of heavily buttered ciabatta bread.  The fries were piping hot and lightly sprinkled with kosher salt. They were thickly cut and delicious!! My hubby had the ahi tuna nicoise salad.  Do not order this! It was bland and not appetizing in the least!  Other than the yummy flatbread, this place was just ok for me."}
{"text":"We booked this place online and we went there for dinner.  Let me save you the time: Dont go there unless youre starving and you have no other choice! Its waaaay overpriced for the quality and amount of food you get.  Service: the server was very courteous but we had to wait for our food for 35min and to wait 5min to get refills of water (you know how important is water in the heat when youre sitting outside- when the water came i thought it was a mirage, thats how excited i was to drink) Food: very average. We ordered tenderloin (asked for well done and got it a but burned, but it was still ok. However it cones with NO sides so you pay 48$ for the piece of meat only), pasta with shrimp (the worst shrimp pasta i have ever had! I had my fair share of weird places and not so good food, but this was really bad: shrimps were overcooked and the pasta that came with it was very blant and cold) We also got gratin potatoes (i would give it 3.5) as it lacked consistency and flavor overall. Scenery: great views on the golfing course if you sit outside. Very relaxing setting  If you come to this place, stick to the drinks and the views! Unless youre starving and cant go anywhere else, i wouldnt recommend this place for dining because the quality was not up to price ranges!  I shared some pictures if youre more visual and my post is too long"}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food was horrible.  We went for dinner, we were excited for some great steaks.  I had the flat iron, it wasn't cooked properly and was very chewy!  The qualify of the meat didn't match the price.  Way over priced for a \"casual\" dinner place.  $38 for a flat iron is a bit ridiculous...  Tried it, won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I am disappointed in the food for the amount it costs. I know this is a Westin - but the two times I came here I left unfulfilled .The salad was not anything special as was the individual pizza. This place got 3 stars just because the food wasn't bad- just not worth the price. The staff seems nice and this place was never crowded. I would highly recommend walking taking a shuttle to a restaurant close to the resort."}
{"text":"All the food was overly smothered in butter and I got sick all night from the buffet that was was priced at 20$. All it offered was tator tots, mini corn dogs, waffles, and chicken tenders. No nutrition what so ever except for the fruit and side salad that didn't contain any sources of fiber or protein. If you're trying to eat healthy I advise you skip out on nellies as none of my peers were satisfied with their meals. Even my friend who ordered only the side asparagus felt sick afterwords. Good luck if you decide to dine at nellies."}
{"text":"I found a Groupon for Nellie Cashman's, so my husband and I thought we would try it. I started with a Nellie's garden $14. drink, it came out in the smallest, \"old fashioned\" \"catering-style\" champagne glass. Certainly not worth $14. The southwest caesar and tombstone wedge salads were not anything exciting. I make my own caesar dressing, and it is better.  We split a tenderloin and ordered the au gratin potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts. Everything was just okay, including the service. If you're looking for a similar menu, with more options and much better food stick with Morton's, Mastro's and Ocean Club."}
{"text":"Nellie's is on the lower level of the Westin Kierland Hotel.  We were pleased with our dinner experience.  The service was outstanding.  I've also eaten breakfast here on two occasions.  Again, I was satisfied each time.  If there is a drawback, it's the price.  Cocktails, for example, ran $10-12 each.  Something to consider if you drink a lot.  I had the NY steak.  It was terrific.  My wife had the pasta, she was also pleased.  The kids had the cheeseburger which looked great, must have also tasted fine as they finished it off.  It's a clean modern setting that looks out over the golf course."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! I have gone here for 10 straights years for my family vacation. The food is outstanding! Hot & fresh! Service is top notch! They just finished a two month remodel. High Recommend!"}
{"text":"Dined in 4/2/2017 with 5 other family members. I regularly grill steaks at home and often splurge for some higher grade beef from AJs so I know what I like and hoe to cook a steak to medium-rare. I am also the kind of person that will eat whatever is given me at a restaurant without any fuss even if it is not what I was expecting. If I eat a meal and it does not meet expectations I cross off that restaurant from my list and move on. I had eaten at Nellie Cashman's a couple month earlier and ordered the $50 Ribeye steak with garlic butter. That steak was wonderful. It was better than any I had ever cooked. The sear was perfect, the texture like butter, the inside was the perfect medium-rare. I was impressed enough that I wanted my family to experience this perfection.   We all sat down and ordered our meals. Of the 6 people at the table 2 of us ordered the Ribeye steaks (both medium rare). The food came out and I immediately knew something was wrong with both steaks. Instead of the plump moist steaks that I had eater earlier these were thin 1/2\"-5/8\" thick cuts that had an odd shape. Knowing how hard it is to cook a medium-rare steak that is this thin, I immediately cut the steak in half to check it (something I never do normally). The Ribeye was completely grey no pink at all inside. The other part that ordered the steak did the same and found the same result. At a price tag of $50 for the steak alone we sent the steaks back and requested they properly prepare them as medium-rare. The rest of the family members received and ate their food.   A short time later 2 new steaks appeared. The texture and thickness of these steaks seemed more appropriate but after cutting into them we found that they were very rare. I would rather eat an underdone steak than an overdone one so decided to just eat it and move on. The steaks were so cold that the garlic butter had not melted on them.   We decided to get a couple desserts after dinner and they delivered the wrong ones as well. Not sure if they let their chef and experienced staff go or if this was a serious off night but all around a bad experience.  Nellie Cashman's restaurant was the first place I had eaten a steak with a significant price tag and had no regrets. It is unfortunate that they not only made the mistake of overcooking the first steaks but then did not care enough to make the replacements properly. This lack of care for the customer and their own craft is unacceptable and cannot be rewarded by my patronage. There are too many places that want to earn business and take pride in their products to waste time with those that don't.  Nellie Cashman's welcome to the X list.  Good luck to those that eat here. I hope you have an experience like my first :)"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Westin and went off property for dinner most nights. On our last night we decided to eat here and we were all pleasantly surprised. The salads were fresh and delicious. The quino bowls were creative and the homemade pasta dish was excellent. I wish we tried this place earlier on so we could have returned. The waiter was also attentive and great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not sure how a restaurant who looks so fancy, but the food so poorly done can even be in a resort like the Westin! We were a large dinner party and every body's food was wayyyy over done! I specifically asked for medium rare knowing most restaurants always over cook steak...and then it came out well done along with all the others. The potatoes that accompanied it were not good either. Some of the apps were good...like the tuna tartar and the beef pastry. And the desserts were good.  The only plus was the staff was super nice...but I didn't come here to pay for a friendly face."}
{"text":"This isn't really new...It's a new concept, and they can't compete with the good steak houses all over Scottsdale.  We used to go there when the hotel opened, and Nellie's was fabulous, unusual, but really creative menu.  Now, they are competing with the big boys, and there is no competition.  First, I want to say, we did buy a Groupon, unfortunately.  I ordered the chicken, which was quite good...the side of scalloped potatoes was in a ramekin, and it was like eating paste, so I left it.  I also ordered a Caesar salad, and that too was good.  My husband ordered a hamburger, medium rare.  And he told the cute server that it had to be medium rare, or it will go back.  Sure enough, it was totally brown inside.  Then he changed to a filet, and the manager came by to apologize, and that this will be right,  It came our blood raw, and once again, he pleaded with my husband to make this right.  We waited about 7 minutes and another one came out.  The server and the manager watched, holding their breath, that it was going to be perfect....and it was just as rare as the first one.  We blamed the manager for not being on top of his game, and not watching the Monday Nite chef.  It's a attractive room, overlooking the golf course, and we had a  great server, but lousy management and an average menu.  They are attempting to appeal to everyone who walks in the door.  They sure lost us.  I would not recommend this New version of Nellie Cashman's Monday Club till they get new chefs and a new theme."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  Review by Leo Damilini kansas.  This is the main cafe at the Westin Kierland.  Although I was very impressed by the hotel, this cafe was ok.  I received free breakfast buffet at the cafe.  The wait staff were very good and there was an omelet station, but I doubt I would have paid $25+ for the breakfast buffet.  There pizza is average.  Review by Leo Damilini kansas."}
{"text":"We were very pleased with our first visit despite reading some previous negative reviews. My sister in law gifted us for our anniversary a 3 course \"pre fixe\"meal through Groupon. The meals we chose consisted of wedge salad, grilled prawns, 14oz ribeye steak, and desserts. Steak was well seasoned, tender and cooked to our liking. I liked that all of the wines and cocktails were from local wineries and distilleries. Prices are high compared to equivalent restaurants outside of the resort, however, it is probably in line with other resort casual hotel properties in the Scottsdale area. So maybe look for future Groupon offers to reduce cost. It would be well worth it. Service, ambiance and decor were all very good and the restaurant has beautiful views of the golf course. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Delightful and surprising. I had the 8oz Prime Tenderloin steak which was excellent - cooked perfectly. The garlic butter sauce, which the waiter recommended, was what took it to another level. I especially enjoyed the Roasted Brussels Sprouts and they were outstanding.  Frankly I only had those two things and was greatly satisfied. My husband had the Pappardelle Romensco with Prawns and the taste I had was fantastic. I also had a glass of wine and frankly that was the only disappointing element for me. I thought for such a nice menu the wine list was sub par with cheap but expensive wine options. However, I would definitely make a return trip."}
{"text":"Good service but the food is just eh.  The golf course view from the restaurant and the Westin in general are beautiful, but this place is just blah.  From the menu and prices you'd think that the ambiance would be nice and food would be phenomenal resort fare, but this place misses the mark entirely.  What you get is a stark atmosphere that has very little to do with the supposed theme of the place and food that just isn't that good.  I'm normally a ribeye fan, but after one look at this place and knowing that this definitely isn't a steak house, I decided to get something that I didn't think they could screw up; a $21 burger.  You would think that, because of the location of this place and the prices, that they could master making the best burger and fries possible.  Wrong.  Instead, what you get is Applebee's.  Well, at Applebee's they might cook it properly so that is probably a bad comparison.  I guess what it comes down to is that the Westin really doesn't expect the people to come back.  They have a steady flow of suckers on expense accounts that might not know there are top-notch restaurants less than a quarter mile away.  However, I am a local that lives a mile away that now knows better.  From now on I plan to stick to cocktails at the hotel's main bar overlooking the golf course."}
{"text":"Beautiful view, outdated decor, decent food I ate lunch here one day during my conference.  We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful view.  The food was decent - we both tried the chicken mole special.  The decor is definitely outdated...this restaurant might be more of a destination if they did some updates."}
{"text":"We had to eat here for several reasons... #1 - I have eaten here before and it was delicious #2 - We were staying at the resort and wanted a good meal #3 - There happened to be a great Groupon deal, and I love my groupons!!  We sat outside, at 6pm on a hot 108 degree July day, it wasn't too bad. Our waiter Miral was pleasant and helpful. He recommended some steaks and the stir fry, along with the Turkey pot pie. We got all three, since there was three of us.   We started with flat bread and eggplant butter. The bread was good, the butter...interesting. Not bad, just different. We also asked for the roasted garlic butter. That tasted like plastic, not good.   The steak was amazingly good, the tenderloin was cooked perfectly and was well, tender. We added a side of garlic mashed potatoes, that melted in your mouth and were rich with fresh butter.  The Shrimp stir fry was fabulous. I counted 14 medium sized shrimp in my dish, they were seasoned perfectly and the stir fry vegetables were the best.  It was a filling and flavorful dish.  I couldn't eat it all and took the rest to go.  The Turkey pot pie was much to be desired. It presented well with a dark brown crusted cornbread top that looked great, the problem was that the inside of the cornbread crust was raw and doughy. When the waiter came around we kindly showed him the raw cornbread. He promptly took it back to the kitchen and brought some fruit for my companion to eat while waiting. The second pot pie arrived piping hot, yet with the same problem, just a little less doughy. The waiter finally came back to check on us and we showed him the same issue. He apologized profusely and asked if he could get us anything else in its place. We kindly declined. The restaurant manager came to our table to apologize and offer another entree and see what the problem was to prevent it from happening in the future. He was also nice enough to offer free dessert to our entire table.  In the end, the pot pie was removed from the bill, we had a groupon (which credited me $40 above what I paid for it), and got two free desserts. The meal would have been $140 plus tip and I paid $87, including a 20% tip on the non-discounted meal. Not a bad deal.   Regardless of the pot pie, our meal was very good and the service was as well.  I would return here for dinner again in the future and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and great view of the golf course. We sat outside and it was lovely.  The food was very tasty with some variations on the traditional menus. Service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive, she even brought us an extra cookie at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Little cutie pie wanted to sit out in the patio for our lunch.  Looking over the menu, hubby decided on the steak tacos ($14), I, the Cheeseburger on a brioche bun ($15) and Grilled Cheese Sandwich and fries ($8) for the little guy.  Everything was kind of bland and nothing to rave about the overpriced lunch.  Might as well go to poolside J. Swillings."}
{"text":"For $37 including champagne you can't go wrong with the Sunday brunch here. While the selection isn't huge some of the stand outs were the king crab legs nicely cut in half, the shrimp cocktail, and the lox.  I also had some scrambled cheese eggs cooked to order, crispy bacon, and some of the sliced prime rib.  While I would have liked to have seen the prime rib carved, the meat was still tasty.  The desserts were also really well done, with a good amount of pastries and chocolate covered strawberries.  Also the champagne was flowing here and the Kirkland that they had went great with the seafood (what do you expect for $37) I'll definitely be back.  A solid brunch with a beautiful setting and price point."}
{"text":"The staff is very good at this Westin restaurant... Breakfast:  buffet is delicious with a great selection, wonderful omelette station, sausages crispy bacon, home fried potatoes, fruit, meats and cheeses and pastries and bagels.  Dinner:  unfortunately, not so good.  We were staying overnight and we're looking for a good place to eat at the resort for families.  They have a good kids buffet with Mac 'n cheese, chicken tenders, tater tots, sliders.  I ordered the Arizona stir fry with shrimp...is was only ok, nothing special.  My husband ordered the turkey pot pie, which was actually terrible.  I'm not sure what was worse...the way it looked or tasted.  The top was a pancake...not puff pastry or the corn bread, it apparently used to be.  The filling was and looked disgusting and was not edible.    I would come back only for breakfast...not for dinner.  The saloon looked like it had a better menu for kids and families."}
{"text":"We arrived a few minutes late for their regular breakfast menu/buffet which ends at 11 am but they do have an all day limited breakfast menu.  I had southwest eggs benedict which was pretty good while my wife had fresh fruit and yogurt which was a generous size.  I'm actually relieved we missed the breakfast buffet because it's $24 per person and we would have eaten way more than necessary!  Service was very good and attentive.  It was pricey for breakfast but most in resort/hotel restaurants are like that . . . you pay for the convenience of not having to go off property."}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Meatloaf and salmon over cooked.  Only offered desert for comp.  The couple next to us said they got sick when they ordered the meatloaf."}
{"text":"Ate there Saturday night and was not impressed. Overpriced food and slow service.  Ordered the $50 ribeye was a half inch thick and burned all around w a lot of fat. Looked like they went to frys and bought it for $10 and threw it on a fire grill and burned it up. Everything is al la cart.  I equated this to cruise food just mediocre at best.  I expected more and left disappointed. Even the turtle cheesecake was not true cheesecake but a round ice cream type sandwich. My wife ordered the $21 sirloin Burger which was also burned on outside and tasted like charcoal.  Will go to Flemings next time and get great service and great steak.  This is not a steakhouse despite the way they promote it on the menu etc."}
{"text":"Decent food but high priced for what it is....  Well, we showed up at 4:15 for an early dinner and were told they don't open until 5pm. Yelp said open all day... So we waited after driving 49 minutes to eat here... We thought we would kill time on the phones using internet like normal.  This place has a rip off wifi policy of requiring you to pay $11.95 for a 4 hour pass while you spend your $50 per steak in the restaurant... There is almost no cell signal since this spot in in the basement so if you need the Internet this is not the place.   The service once seated was alright... Nothing special...   They do not have sweet tea, just the unsweetened stuff... That's always a disappointment....  Appetizer was corn chowder and it was actually a solid 4.5 out of 5 for a soup...  The flat bread with hummus was pretty good too, a 4 out of 5!  I had a Mojito with 10 Kane rum, it was decent, about 3.9 out of 5 stars... Not much rum and less simple syrup than usual.  There was no pepper on the table which would be overlooked at a less expensive place... I grabbed it from the empty table next door.....  I ordered the rainbow trout and it was a 3.8 star of 5 for the fish and the rest of the plate was a solid 4 star at the $24 mark or so...  Donna ordered the campfire chicken and I would give it a 4 star rating. It's about $24  All in all this spot isn't really worth stopping into... Better food is available all over and without walking across Arizona from their parking lot and the. Down and around a whole building into a basement...."}
{"text":"If the best thing about a restaurant is walking in and reading the history about the namesake then you know the restaurant is not anything special. The view of the golf course was nice.  This would be a one star if not for Clifford and his amazing service! The first thing we had was the complimentary sliced flatbread and eggplant dip.  The flatbread was awkwardly moist and the eggplant was very bland (I love baba ganoush BTW).  I had the rib eye and my wife had the NY strip, both steaks were subpar but not horrible.  I will say that one of the sauces that came with the steak was phenomenal, it was called Roasted Shallot Cabernet Reduction.  If we go back to dine at the Westin we will go to Deseo."}
{"text":"Had the sunday brunch,  First off was, we had a reservation at 11, when we got there they acted like they did not even know we wanted the brunch. The staff was going really fast and looked like it was the first time they where haveing a brunch.  as for The food, the salads where all ready and looked great, the other food well they; where still setting up when we got there and still where 30 min into the brunch. They did not keep up with the customers demands and kept putting out small portions nor any serving utensils.   The crab was great and cooked perfectly and same with the shrimp, when they had it out. The salads were good to but everything else was down hill from there, the staek they served was hard to cut or to eay but all had fat and allot of grissle, the grooper was cooked to long makeing it dry and hard , the omelet station could not keep up nor the deserts, pancakes, and waffles . The omelet i ordered was undercook and still runny.   I asked the manager on call about getting some more deserts out and he looked at me and gave a wise ass remark and walked away.   The best part of the meal was the crab, fruit, and view!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is very good and all the staff are friendly.   Don't order the grilled shrimp app - way way too salty and you get 3 shrimps for $14  My husband ordered the turkey pot pie it was ok. It's the Latin American version so they use corn bread instead of puff pastry.   I ordered the pork chop for main and it was salty too."}
{"text":"We (SBL & Mini Me and myself) went fancy for a staycation and decided to stay at the Westin Kierland Resort. Wile there we ate at a place called Nellie Cashman's. The place opens at 5:00 pm for dinner, we were the first ones there of course. We were seated in a very nice dining room with a great view of the golf course.  We were immediately greeted with our awesome server for the night, I am pinching myself for not remembering her name. She took our orders and told us about some items that were not on the menu for kids even. We ordered, and soon after we were given a basket of bread and... Not regular bread, but fancy bread as Mini Me said. The bread and the schmear that came with was delightful . We talked and drank and finished our bread. We waited and waited and waited some more, did I mention that we waited?   Finally, just as we were going to say something our soup and salad came. SBL ordered the beef barley soup which reminded him of his childhood days. I ordered a salad that had roasted tomatoes and cheese and had an excellent house dressing mix.   We finished our starters barely before the main course came. SBL ordered the New York strip and mashed potatoes. MM ordered a personal sausage pizza and chicken strips, and I ordered the campfire chicken which came with roasted brussel sprouts and scalloped potatoes.  After waiting a crazy long time for our food, and only being the 3rd party in there at that time now, we were disappointed that our food was cold.   We told our server our mashed potatoes, the sausage pizza and my brussels were cold and my chicken was super dry. Hugely disappointing but she was good to us and brought hot potatoes and brussels and didn't charge us for the pizza. She took off 20% of the bill which was thoughtful.  We were just excited to try Nellie Cashman's, we had been looking forward to it; we typically don't eat that fancy so it was kind of a big deal and an even more of a let down. We were told there was a new guy in the kitchen:/  So yea, there's that."}
{"text":"My friend and I obtained a Groupon and went to dine here Saturday evening. The food I must say was excellent. I had a flat iron steak and mashed potatoes. She had chicken and Brussel sprouts. We both got a wedge salad and the Kailua cake for dessert. While the food was awesome, the service was very slow. There were about 4 tables seated during the time of our visit,including us.  We waited quite a while for our food even though we ordered almost immediatley after sitting down..everything came out slowly. We were there about 2.5 hours but mostly because of the speed at which the food took to get to us.  If return but I definitely would hope service would be quicker."}
{"text":"Brunch and bottomless mimosas are amazing!!!! Definitely recommend if you want a buffet for brunch!!! The BEST red pepper hummus I've ever tasted, I crave it since I have tried it!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here!  Super friendly staff, extensive buffet and great a la carte menu. We had a breakfast burrito and granola yogurt pancakes...yum!  Nice morning atmosphere to start your day!"}
{"text":"Checked into Westin.  Had limited time to grab a bite before we had to run to a show but starving. We were pointed to two choices: steak house or pub style restaurant on-site. We chose steak house.   I was a bit skeptical at first. After all, I had breakfast in this same room last year. But wow, were we in for a treat. We had the beef tenderloin and the ribeye. Both were some of the best pieces of meat we have ever had. Cooked to perfection as ordered. And we are foodies so expectations are on the high side. The sides were also very pleasant surprise: potatoes au-gratin were excellent: creamy and cheesy. Bristle sprouts well baked and slightly crispy. And the wedge salad was the bomb.   Wine list was \"good enough\", but then again, I am a bit finicky with wine lists.    Overall an extremely pleasant experience. Probably one which gets overlooked with so many flashy restaurants nearby.  Don't be afraid to try it!"}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant three times during our stay.  I loved the mixed greens with apple vinaigrette and chicken.  Absolutely delicious.    The problem:  my son's hamburger came out smelling like char--it was absolutely not freshly cooked and way over done.  We sent it back and the new one was fine--not great, just fine.  The waiters were accommodating and otherwise, all was good."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Nothing like eating outside on the patio at 6 PM and hearing  the bagpiper that has been there for 17 years!  The food is great, the service is wonderful..the whole atmosphere is wonderful, as you can be outside and there are fire pits all around and places to sit and enjoy the outside when the weather allows.  i"}
{"text":"Sat outside during a nice summer night and enjoyed great music! Service was great and The Manhattan was what stood out. The bitters and whiskey they used created a smooth sip that's worth coming back for. My dad had the steak, I had the quinoa shrimp stir fry. Both were great! Turtle cheesecake was a great finish - only complaint was that it was too small.  The bagpipe 3D show that interrupted the live music every 20 min was unnecessary (maybe try it once an hour or every two so the same guests don't see it again and again, nor interrupt the live music) but not the restaurant's fault so won't takeaway a star for it.  I'm an SPG gold member and they did a great job recognizing that - from knowing my name and where I'm from when we sat down to automatically taking off the discount from our bill without asking. Great experience there!"}
{"text":"Eight of us dined at Nellie Cashmans Thurs. evening, the 23rd and had a very positive experience. Our group, the Dining Divas, choose a restaurant a month, taking turns selecting the place. I chose this because I llke the Westin and had a Fine Dining card which I did not use.The prices were appealing, also. Zorica was our server and did her job very well with patience and attention. Trout, salmon and chicken were the entres chosen and everyone was happy with their food.This does not happen that often.  The atmosphere was quiet and the round table lended itself to one conversation.  The down side was the wait for the apple cobler dessert."}
{"text":"We ate our first breakfast at Nellie's after a long flight from the east coast and a too short night's sleep.  The wait staff provided much needed coffee but also a recommendation to take a peek at the breakfast buffet that was underway.  While we thought it was a bit overpriced, she explained that the purchase of a breakfast and entree and a beverage (coffee or juice) would add up to the same price.  We indulged ourselves in the buffet - turned it into breakfast and lunch!!!  Wish we had remembered to use our AAA card to receive a discount - but it was still worth every bite... I mean buck!"}
{"text":"REALLY good.  Are here the 1st night I was staying at the Westin for a conference.  They bring you bread and a dip/spread made from eggplant that is curiously delicious.  I had to ask what it was because I couldn't pinpoint the flavors.  I had the campfire chicken dish which I now cannot get out of my head, so I'm going back to have it for dinner again...2 days later."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing dining experience. Despite friendly staff, none of the three entrees we ate were properly cooked, especially the way overdone pork chop.  Service is friendly, but there are better restaurants within this hotel not to mention within walking distance of the hotel.    My suggestion, skip it..."}
{"text":"Ok, so I know I shouldn't expect much from hotel restaurants.  I'll try to make it quick and painless.  The good:  the grilled flat bread with the citrus garlic hummus like paste that they give you instead of bread.  Considering it's a resort hotel cafe, the price wasn't ridiculous.    The bad:  Slow service.  I was there when it was DEAD, and the service was nonetheless slow, especially on the coffee refills.  I ordered the ahi nicoise salad.  After checking to confirm that it wasn't tuna from a can, I got this dry, marinated tuna steak (about 3/8\" thickness) on top of what was an egg, tomato and kalamata topped caesar salad.  The tuna was about the salties thing I ever tasted.  It was like eating a tuna steak version of salted anchovies.  Brutal.    Lesson:  Don't eat the nicoise salad.  Go for something that they really can't screw up, like a grilled chicken sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"This review is for the breakfast buffet on a Friday morning which is $22 per adult and $11 per child 5 and older.  I always wonder at a buffet if I am getting my monies worth and almost always the answer is no. But I love the variety I get from buffets and getting a sampling of each thing. I also love that everyone in a group can find something to eat. Here's the quick guide on my food choices:  - coffee: yes...freshly brewed and strong. - egg white omelet from omelet station with spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, jalapeños and onions with mozzarella: not usually an omelet fan but it was really good...especially with their fresh homemade salsa. - mini waffles: oh yeah...perfectly made with just enough crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. The batter was perfect. - half whole wheat toasted bagel with cream cheese, lox, capers, red onion slivers: delicious! The salmon was also delicious. Not to salty. - fresh berries of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries.: yup...this was fresh and constantly restocked too - mini cream Danish: yum...  In addition they had bacon, potatoes, pancakes, lots of pastries and chocolate croissants,  at least four juice options and several milk options, cereal, oatmeal, granola, etc...  From what I can tell, everything was delicious and cooked well. We were all pleasantly pleased. Would we do it again? Yes we would."}
{"text":"After researching the Westin and amenities they offered, I found they served a Sunday brunch. I was excited because I love brunch buffets and this one sounded similar to the one I enjoyed at Shugrue's in Lake Havasu City recently for Mother's Day. Since it was my Mom's birthday, I decided we should give this a try. I'm glad we did because it was a good experience.   We arrived at 11:30am with no reservation and they were quick to seat us and take our drink order. Then we got up and indulged in the many offers. There was an omelet station, a waffle/pancake area, tons of fresh fruit and a salad bar. Then there was a meat/cheese station with other small appetizer bites (tuna tartar and goat cheese/mushrooms on crostini bread). Then there was a meal station - this included herbed steak with caramelized onions, snapper with cous cous, a vegetable melody, a pork dish, and then a chicken dish. The steak was the best. It was so good I had two servings of it. If they served this every Sunday, I'd be there every Sunday. Finally, there was a dessert station. Nothing was named, but for the most part you could figure out what they were (brownies, tarts, chocolate covered strawberries, etc).   I really enjoyed all the fresh fruit, the variety of meats, and how the service was. Our waiter was really nice - quick to get more water and quick to take our empty plates. For $28.50 per person, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I, along with a friend, decided to try this restaurant for our New Year's Eve dinner at 7:00. When we arrived at the hotel, we noticed that this is where Stanford U. was holding their pep rally. Place was buzzing with Red and White and shirts with large printed letter 'S'  or 'STANFORD' . Walking down to the restaurant we were greeted and told it would be a minute. The staff and waiters were very cordial. The place was packed full of people and the noise level was tolerable. We started off with the Waldorf Salad which was AMAZING. The dressing was just the right amount.The acidity in the dressing was just enough to wake up those little taste buds.  After about 20 minutes, the waiter apologized about the service being slow and would comp my wife's wine. We hadn't realize that the time was flying by, 40 minutes had passed and the waiter came over with the dessert menu and said that our whole meal was being comp because they hadn't gotten our main course out to us. He said to go ahead and order dessert and coffee.  When our entrees appeared, my wife had the Roasted Half Chicken which was cooked just right and I had the Herb-Marinated Pork Chop which was cooked medium well. The Apple-Thyme Chutney was sparsely place under the chop, Wishing there was more. The Sweet Potato Mash was wonderful. Our friend had the Filet Mignon which was cooked medium well. He had no problems polishing his plate off. We finished our meals with our Starbucks coffee and apple cobbler which was huge. Even though our meal was comp'd, the food was excellent and we will come back to try it for breakfast or lunch. I just found out by reading another review that if you want bread, you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Went here today for brunch. I normally Yelp places before I eat there, but the friends I was meeting with suggested this spot. I was worried as this place only had 3 stars... But, it turned out to be a great time. Beautiful scenery, great ambiance, servers are on top of it, and food was pretty tasty.   Sunday brunch was buffet style consisting of fresh seafood, breads, pastas, bacon, eggs, an omelette station, dessert, and much more.   *Bottomless mimosas also make any day a good day! Haha.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Great food, wonderful staff.   Very nice place to eat.   Comfy.     The views are nice too.  Thanks got a great place to est."}
{"text":"I like coming to this venue at The Westin because it has a beautiful setting. The Golf view and the Cafe setting makes for a very nice lunch. The salads are very fresh and tasty. The tacos have a nice flavor."}
{"text":"The location was nice, inside the Kierland Weston Resort. Had issues finding our way downstairs to the restaurant since their isn't any signage in the lobby for this particular restaurant. The other restaurants had signage. We were seated in the back of the restaurant by someone with a thick accent. Our actual waitress also had a thick accent and I kept looking at my girlfriend to help me interpet. We both ordered the $50 Rib Eye steaks with our choice of flavored butter. Nothing comes with it so we had to order salads, veggies and mashed potatoes on the side. When our orders arived, everything was room temperature. My first initial indication was that the pat of green butter wasn't melted. My second indication that something wasn't right was size, shape and cut of the actual \"rib eye\".  The meat was thin, tough, chewy and had a lot of grissle. This was definitely not a rib eye, at least not even a $5 piece of meat. I am very confident that this was their flat iron steak being passed off for a $50 Rib Eye. Honestly, I've had better steak at Denny's. Ruth's Chris has nothing to worry about.  The margaritas were good as were the garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus spears, but the steak was really, really horrid.  Fortunately, I was able to use my diners club card to get one of the \"steaks\" for free. Even at that, this place is way over priced for the ambiance and the food served. 2 meals, 2 drinks, no desert, with discount was still $125."}
{"text":"I love this resort.  I did not love this restaurant, though.  It was ok and I had a decent meal of a salad with vanilla glazed salmon - which was fine, but somehow uninspired.  I really did feel that I was eating in a hotel, as opposed to eating in a restaurant that could stand on its own.  Also, the drinks from the bar were just kinda \"off\" - first time I've ever ordered a whiskey straight up and had it served in a martini glass with some sort of foamy fizz collecting at the top.    I don't want to say \"don't eat here\" because it wasn't  bad. If you don't have high expectations, this place is fine. It was just ok.  There are better eating options within this sprawling resort we've since learned.  Side note 1;   If you're staying at the resort, most of this menu is available as room service.  Be ready for the 22% \"gratuity\" and the $3.00 service charge and the 9.25% tax rate for this room service - but you know, sometimes it's worth it.  Side note 2;  Consider walking off resort, through the main entrance  to the 3-block high-end, but sub-designer shopping area across the street.  It is filled with wine bars, multiple margarita specialists, sushi,  steak and disposable income themed  establishments that cater to wealthy, Jaguar / Audi SUV / Mercedes, BMW 5 series and above/ crowd that continues on with conspicuous consumption.  If that last sentence describes you or your aspirations, you will have a good experience across the street."}
{"text":"Nellie Cashman's is the casual dining place at the Westin Kierland.  I would give it 4 stars for breakfast, probably 3 stars for dinner.  The breakfast buffet is really nice, great omelet station & waffles to order, and good fruit/meat/cheese selection.  Service is helpful and definitely request a table outside.  Dinner was pretty average.  The menu is not that broad, mostly steak and a few other choices.  The pita bread served at the start was inedible (overcooked/hard).  The steak was decent, but not prepared to my specification.  The good news was we had a great view of the bagpipes which made for a really nice evening with the family."}
{"text":"Wait staff was excellent and so attentive. We enjoyed the bread and eggplant humus. The campfire chicken was very good too. Beautiful view of the golf course."}
{"text":"I usually have something to type about with my reviews. This is one of the reviews where I won't typing that much. There's not much to say about this place.  The service was fine. I only went because I wanted dessert. As soon as I glanced at the menu and saw Strawberry Apple Pie, my dessert choice had been made. I did take a look at the rest of their food but nothing jumped out at me.  The place was surprisingly dead. There were only a few people in the entire place.   Go here for dessert."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Villa's and decided to walk over to Nellie Cashman's for a 6:00 pm Friday dinner. We were able to catch the nightly bagpiper performing outside of the restaurant, which was a nice touch. It was too cool to sit outside, so we got an indoor table near the windows. Surprisingly, there were few diners in the restaurant. The waitstaff was pleasant. My husband got the Ribbons of Kale which was crisp and colorfully plated. I ordered the Arizona stir fry, which was good but not overly seasoned. My son loved the Lamb Mole Ragu, which looked like a fine portion. Overall, a pleasant experience, nicely plated food,and all at reasonable price."}
{"text":"We stopped in after an 'at home' dinner at our room in the Villas across the way because we wanted a bit of dessert. I was interested in something that was on the online menu, but the current menu was different.  I ended up ordering the berry creme brulee. I really wanted a crispier bruleed top, and it was a little runny, texture-wise. (Maaaaybe I have been watching too much Great British Bake Off...also I just adore and eat a lot of creme brulees....). But it tasted pretty a-ok! It seemed a little strange to me that the place was basically empty at 6:30-7pm on a friday night. There were certainly more people sitting outside, but it is always weird to me to be the only group in a restaurant. Service was fine.  It was all ok. Nothing that made me want to rush back for dinner service. I wouldn't argue though if someone wanted to go here."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of buying a Groupon to this new \"Steakhouse\" for dinner. I should have read the reviews here prior and probably would have passed. This is not a steakhouse as you walk through an area for Brunch and its your basic resort restaurant. Nothing special. We went on a Sunday night and there were 12 people in the restaurant all evening while we were there with a kitchen staff of five, two hostesses, two waitresses and two busboys.   I ordered a Tito's Martini dry, up, olives and it arrived. Very cold, tasted good but I realized that what I thought were ice chips were not melting. Yep, I got some leftover citrus in my drink. Sent it back. Got a new one in a glass that I had to work my way around the lipstick stains in order to find a clean spot. Not cold. Do I send another back? Ugh. I guess I should have as I never imagined it was going to ring-up at $19 when the bill came. All of the specialty drinks on their menu were under $14.   Next, the corn chowder was very good. The Tombstone Wedge was very nice. The \"10oz\" Strip steak was a solid 7oz upon arrival and was certainly not of prime caliber. The baked potato for $5 was fine but had a value of $3.   Our waitress was nice and did a good job. Busboys were not capable of taking care of a customer other than filling the water - couldn't solve any actual problems.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"FYI, Yelp has the hours wrong. They open back up at 5pm for dinner.  We arrived around 4pm so we had to wait an hour to get seated.  The menu is very limited. We ordered the campfires chicken and the trout. The corn chowder for an appetizer.  The chicken campfire was good, had lots of flavor and the chicken was moist. I'm not a fan of dry chicken.  The complimentary bread with hummus was good as well.  The food wasn't bad at all. But the prices were a bit much for what it was.  We had a $75 groupon and still paid an extra $20. Therefore, I would give it a 3 stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic Sunday brunch!! And being under $35 is affordable for almost anyone. Located inside the Westin Kierland it's set in the back of the resort facing the golf course giving beautiful views of the green. Beautiful spread with plenty for everyone! I love been multiple times and enjoy the omelette station, crab legs and chocolate covered strawberries. Every once in a while I will add on the unlimited mimosas which if it's a busy Sunday at nelly cashmans the service isn't always the best so you may have to wait for a mimosa refresh ( this has happened more than once) but other than that the buffet options are tasty and it's a very clean environment!"}
{"text":"Wow bad. The stir fry is awful, tastes like plain soy sauce, and the kids' pizzas are miniscule -- but I mean 4\"-5\" -- and unappetizing. We waited a whole hour for our food to arrive. The kids' grilled cheese turkey \"with popcorn and kale chips\" came with a commercial bag of popcorn and the kale chips were also a small commercial bag that tasted like bad tortilla chips. My husband had the chicken pot pie and a salad and he said they were both good but I left half my stir fry. Word to the wise, note to management, you've got to feed the the kids well if you make them wait an hour to be served."}
{"text":"Pleasant staff and servers some times but grumpy and inattentive servers at other times... however always terrible food and portions for the price. I ate here twice and got the breakfast buffet...... for $26 it was the worst breakfast of my life. And a \"shaved chicken\" sandwich (it was low quality deli meat) for a lunch another day.  At breakfast they have an omelet area but no one was manning it. Flies were buzzing around the fresh fruit. Foods which were supposed to be crunchy were soggy (bacon) and those which were supposed to be tender (stuffed French toast) were hard and inedible. Food which should have been cold was warm (cottage cheese) and food which should have been hot was lukewarm (potatoes and eggs). Some pastries seemed fresh but others seemed more dry (muffins).   For lunch I ordered a soup because the sandwich came with no side on the menu. When it arrived it actually had a flavorless jicama slaw. The chicken club had no \"club\" like ingredients (no cheese or bacon etc). It had only two slices of tomato, some lettuce and low quality deli meat instead of anything resembling shaved chicken meat. It was very sad for me because I do not eat deli meats because they're so processed. I felt totally lied to by the menu. It was unpleasant.  The corn chowder tasted great but I got a small cup in a small bowl and it was $7. Outrageous. Also it said it had chorizo in it but really it was three or four slices of deep fried and rock hard chorizo.   Also although I was a party of 1, a tip was added to my lunch and it was much higher than what I felt was reasonable since my server never checked on me after my entree was brought, never brought me any more water or tea, etc. I haven't heard of a server tipping themselves for a party of 1. Very odd.  I had food off the pool menu at this resort which was better than these offerings so I can't recommend this restaurant at all.   The hotel has shuttle services to nearby shopping areas which have restaurants that have great food so I recommend heading there to eat or lounging by the pool instead.  I believe the person in charge of the kitchen should eat a few meals here and pay for them to see if they feel this restaurant is being appropriately maintained. I have had better food from other onsite resort restaurants, so surely they can do better. I have actually had better food on a *ferry* so I KNOW this place can do better."}
{"text":"Meh. If you have the energy to leave property grounds, do it.  Service was very good.  Ordered NY steak (tasted like Applebee's) Gratin Potatoes: weren't cooked well Asparagus was very good  Pork with fried rice: both were extremely dry. Rice had decent flavor but just dry. Pork was almost not edible it was so dry.   Bread and hummus (I think it needed salt) but my hubs loved it.  Wouldn't go back. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the breakfast buffet during our stay at the resort. Although the selections offered aren't vast, there's enough to offer a decent variety. Their omelets are made to order and there are mini-waffles at the same station that are delicious! My only complaint is that there were no strawberries and whipped cream to accompany them. I also enjoyed offerings of smoked salmon, country bacon and home fried potatoes which were slightly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Of course there were other items, but I didn't eat them so I can't recall all there were. Our bill was $70 for two people which I think was very overpriced considering the foods offered, but it may have been because it was Fathers Day, I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Nellie's is in the Westin Kierland Hotel.  Like the previous Yelper said, its not bad for a hotel restaurant.  We had the flatbread and eggplant/hummus spread-- it was tasty and complimentary.  We also ordered foods that were pretty hard to screw up: onion rings french fries fresh fruit chicken, fig, gorgonzola cheese flatbread pizza  The service was slow.  It felt like forever to get our bill.  But the food was decent and it was simple.  I couldn't help feeling like I was dining in a circus tent though."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant is wonderful. Food is great, service fast...morning smoked salmon..wonderful. Everything fresh and lovely. I would like to make special mention of the server VEON in this Cafe. Every morning greeted us with sincerity and joy. Just made our mornings. Thanks VEON. Westin should know, as Gold members and owners...we notice and appreciate above and beyond service. VEON is an true asset."}
{"text":"Wow!    I was on co conference while at this restaurant.  Therefore we had a set menu.  First off the wait staff is really good and nice.  They were never over bearing but made sure they checked in with us. The hostess was also very good, always informed and if they didn't know they would find out.  I ordered from a set menu - griddle cakes, chicken, vanilla gelato.  Just very good.  The portions were larger than average and the flavours were very balanced and flavourful.  No one complained about anything.  The food was prepared fresh as you can see the open kitchen that it's prepared from.  The quality of the ingredients elevated the foods.  Very impressed for resort food, it was an experience parallel to a chef restaurant.  This restaurant is consistent and just a really great dining experience."}
