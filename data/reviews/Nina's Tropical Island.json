{"text":"Good Place to dine! I've gone there a few times and their service is great."}
{"text":"Bruh! The best roti I've hand in a while. Delivery was on point. They have amazing service. If you want Caribbean food, this is the place to be. They close at 8pm, I called at 8:10 and they were still able to make my order and deliver. Good service guys! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Real Island Food!  Curry Goat, Oxtail, rice and peas all delicious! Pepper Sauce good too! Busy but fast for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent Caribbean gem. Excellent BBQ and jerk chicken (I prefer the BBQ). Ask for oxtail gravy on the rice. Roti is also great! Watch for their hotsauce - deadly ;). Home made fried chicken is nice and crispy. Overall, it's clean and a good vibe."}
{"text":"I must admit, this is my first Caribbean restaurant that I've been to since I've moved to Toronto/GTA over the past 15 years. I used to live in Jamaica, and this pretty much comes close to the taste, and authenticity of Jamaican/Caribbean food. 

My coworkers have been to this place many times, and I finally decided to go with them. For the first item, I ordered the veggie roti. The price was decent around $5.20 ish, and I picked up a Grace Ginger beer to go with it. 

The portion was just right, and I must say it sure filled me up. The ingredients they used, such as the chick peas, veggies, and the sauce/gravy was fantastic. Spice level was perfect too. The texture and flavour of the roti was perfect, and I think it was dhal roti, but I could be wrong.

Either way, it was totally worth it, and I can definitely see myself coming here in the near future."}
{"text":"First I am not a Caribbean food expert.  Although I have had roti before a few times, I mainly eat doubles.  However Tropical Island doesn't have doubles, so I had the vegitarian roti. It was quite large, and the filling was good with lots of chick peas, and other vegetables including a couple of potatoes.  It was not too spicey which suits me, but I think they have hot sauce you can get on the side.  You can see the food behind the counter and it all looked good.  The service was quick and friendly.  I don't live very close, but I may go back if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This was my second time eatting Carribbean food so I don't have much to compare it with however I felt that the chicken was a bit dry (I ordered the Jerk Chicken main). The sauce from the ox tail that they put on the rice was good though. I would return to try their other items."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in and industrial area. The ox tail on beans and rice never fail to please. Made daily the meat on the ox tail is perfectly stewed.  Don't forget to try to beef patties."}
{"text":"Great go to place for roti.  I'm sure the other items are just as tasty.  Live the cole slaw as well!"}
{"text":"Chicken was very good. Juicy and spiced perfectly and still hot even after delivery. Rice was good. I had a medium size and was VERY filling. Good prices. Fried Dumpling is amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and stopped by to try Nina's. We shared curry chicken and roti. Curry chicken was quite bad. Very little flavor or color. It also tasted over cooked. Roti was Ok but nothing to write home about. Rating this place as 3 stars as there are not many Carribean places in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best jamaican cuisine ive had anywhere in gta. As soon as u pull up and get out of ur car u can smell how good this place is . Only reason im not givin this place 5 stars is cuz that font have peas soup  only chicken and on thursdays beef but otherwise its hands down  the best to me very flavourful . Oxtail actually has meat lol and they have home made pepper sauce"}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Excellent food. Doesn't look like much but the staff are super friendly and always smiling. Love this place. Get adventurous and try the curry goat. Even the coleslaw is awesome."}
{"text":"My first time there today -  post surgery meal jerking at its best.....  portion to quality to price ratio is incredibly decent!!  How come I didn't know about it before beats me..  I'm going to recommend this hidden gem  fresh and delicious and the hot sauce was fantastic yum!!"}
{"text":"Best Carribean food in the area!  We love the Stew Chicken. All other dishes were also good. Very inexpensive and friendly staff. Busy lunch time place as it's smack in the middle of an industrial area."}
{"text":"First time at this particular jerk chicken restraunt. Have only been to a few other jerk chicken places but this one was by far my favorite. Really nice rice and jerk chicken with curry gravy. Somewhat spicy meal as most jerk places are but not too crazy. Relatively cheap meal, had an extremely filling meal for 10$. All around pleasant dining experience for anyone looking for a   delicious jerk chicken feast."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all 

Ordered delivery, the delivery guy was the owners son who was a good dude but did not bring any change and I had to stand around for 10 plus minutes as I watched him ask everyone who passed by for change for a 20 (would have gave him a pass as he was cool but...)

I ordered two whole red snapper and food and instead got one whole and two fillets, no food whatsoever..after I tried the whole snapper I decided to not even bother calling them to complain as the food wasnt good enough to be worth the hassle

I am not slamming them, they are a solid 3/5 on food taste, the rice and peas was done well, the coleslaw was decent, the brown stew fish was way too sweet but I am guessing the cut down the spice for the local demographic so it makes sense

I am also reasonably certain that aside from their lack of soup diversity that the rest of the menu is done pretty well.

I am not sure which part they are from but I would opine that curry goat, oxtail, stew chicken and roti are probably pretty good or they would not still be in business

AS long as you are not expecting good soup or fish it may be worth a visit

*Do not order delivery"}
{"text":"Best place around Thornhill/Maple for Caribbean curry fix. Food is good, recommend the goat and chicken curries, served with a nice creamy coleslaw. Hot sauce is pretty good but is a little on the rich side (it seems to have a slightly creamy texture). I don't rate the Jerk but then I've been spoiled by Shandra's Roti Shop in Mississauga, it compares favorably to other Jerk places that are local. This is the place I go if I can't get to Shandra's and certainly the best in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down best dumplings I've ever had.  Jerk chicken ordered with rice and peas in point almost made me forget all the others I've tried.  

The oxtail sauce on top is a favourite in our office and it's much anticipated that everyone is in board when it comes to ordering from here. 

I have yet to visit but so far I'm impressed with the food itself so that is all that matters. 
Interested to try the oxtail and curry goat sometime as well."}
{"text":"Had the rice and oxtail for lunch and added some collard greens on the side. 
The oxtail was great and the greens just delicious, the whole thing is simple Jamaican flavour and really authentic. 
The price is not cheap compared to other Jamaican places but they really load the little takeaway container so you get a good meal for around 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, and some options on the menu. 
Roti was alright. Not a lot of flavour. 
But the worst part of the whole experience was the actual roti itself. I dont think it was fresh. And it seemed to be under cooked (Very doughy in a raw way). 

Dont think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Wow - My first time there today and I must say that overall this place and its food is highly recommended.

I got the large jerk chicken for $10.95. This came with 2 chicken leg quarters, a very healthy portion of beans and rice, your choice of \"sauce\" (curry, jerk, goat meat etc), coleslaw and hot sauce.

Very filling for the price.

Although I would have to say the meat is a bit dried out, given it may have been sitting there pre heated for a while, the rice was a bit chunky, and it didn't quite pack as much heat as I was hoping for.

But despite these minor concerns, I would not hesitate to recommend or go back to this place for a good hearty meal"}
{"text":"What a nice, comfy place! Very authentic & delicious, huge portions, prices are surprising reasonable, and it's on the way home :)."}
{"text":"Rich, delicious and authentic. 
Excellent selection of hot sauces as well that you can purchase. 


Flip side it, be prepared for some disorganization and wait times. Your best strategy is to call in and pick up your food later. This place looks nice, but it's not prepared staff wise for the dinning room experience."}
{"text":"Had the Jerk Chicken dinners: Food is at the top of the price range for this category.  Service was quick as expected with everything laid out ready for assembly. 

Went an hour before closing and most food items were still full, which was a concern to me. Place is tugged away in an industrail area and I imagine not much traffic after work places close for the day.

Chicken was dry and small sized.  Not worth a revisit.

Closes 8pm."}
{"text":"The best goat roti in vaughan plus you get a free cos law and hot sauce.The customer  service is great too :) ill be back for more. Thanks nina"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I go for the curry goat roti! It is so flavourful. The spices used in the curry are to die for. I definitely want to try the other curries. They have a special hot sauce they provide you with and it's so delicious."}
{"text":"This place has the potential for being a great place to eat.  But honestly the food is undercooked half the time. Don't get me wrong, when the food is cooked properly it is amazing. Oxtail is a must try. I was very disappointed eating there today. I was about to take a bite of my jerk chicken, until I noticed the meat was still pink. Please read this and improve before it's too late!"}
