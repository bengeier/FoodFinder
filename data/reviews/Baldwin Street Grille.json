{"text":"My husband and I just ordered delivery from this place so I'd thought I'd do a review of that.  We had just gotten back from a very long trip and were both super tired.  In addition, our car battery had died and we didn't want to deal with it in the moment so we decided to order delivery.  I've been getting pretty tired of the standard places that deliver in our area (Chinese food, pizza) so I thought I'd try Baldwin Street Grille.  We ordered 2 stuffed burgers, fries, sweet potato fries and the smoked gouda mac and cheese wedges.  On the positive side...It all arrived hot and was delivered in under an hour.  Everything was delicious.  On the less positive side, it was VERY expensive.  I already think Baldwin Street Grille's menu prices are a little on the high end although the burgers and fries were still within reasonable.  The gouda wedges were like $6 and came with about 8 one-bite pieces, to me this was ludicrous and I won't be getting them again.  Also the delivery fee combined with tip was over $10.  All in all we paid $45 for 2 burgers with sides of fries and the mac and cheese wedges--That's just too expensive in my opinion.  I will give them credit though, I guess if you want a good burger on my side of town and you're too lazy/tired to go out and get it-- you'll have to shell out."}
{"text":"This place has recently switched management, with a few new additions to the menu. EXCELLENT fried pickles, sriracha mayo, fried mushrooms, and tater tots. Becky is an excellent bartender and they have a good rotating selection of beers. My only constructive criticism would be sometimes the kitchen closes too early (it can be hard to find good late night food in this neighborhood) and their glasses of wine are a little skimpy...but I guess it's not really a wine place!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Renee is an excellent bartender and the chef puts out a good plate of food every time.   For the past reviews slamming the decor, it is a bar, so know that when you walk in. But it still has great food and friendly service.   One thing... the karaoke on Thursday needs to go. Thursday night football trumps karaoke."}
{"text":"The place looks a little divey on the outside--don't be deterred! The food is excellent and a good deal and the beer selection is top notch. The owner and waitstaff make an effort to connect and I know that they have improved the interior considerably over the time they've taken over. The owner's goal is to be a neighborhood spot--as a neighbor, I look forward to the grand plan!"}
{"text":"First don't let the outside fool you. Most of them evening it was 5 star.  Great service, great beer selection and exceptional food (fish fry and shrimp po boy). At some point however the service became non-existent.  Couldn't get a drink or bill at all.  It was busy the entire time we were there.  Just a little odd about the service.  Would still highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, it used to be Pug Mahone's.  They have a nice selection of craft beers and they've done a reasonably nice job with the interior.  The low rating comes from my experience on my second visit.    Wanting a late-afternoon burger, I sauntered over to Baldwin St. Grille.  Upon entering I noticed immediately that it was quite cold, maybe 55 degrees and that the place reeked of smoke from the wood stove.  This is not what you want on a cold and clammy April day.  I sat down at the bar and noticed that everybody in the place was fixated on a soccer match, blaring from two large screen televisions, and that they all seemed to be somehow buddies with the owner.  I got no service until the owner directed the bartender to help me.    I ordered the special, the black and blue burger and fries.  The burger was absolutely excellent.  I can't complain about the food, but the cold was really getting to me and I was completely put off by the clubby atmosphere.  I felt very much like an outsider in some other guy's basement.  No one ever asked me how the food was, if I wanted anything else or if I wanted a second beer.  When I finally decided it was time to go, the bartender was busy dawdling at the other end of the bar, paging through a catalog and futzing with some other thing.    I would say that the experience was definitely one of the least professional restaurant serving/bartending experiences I've had and that the bizarrely cold, clubby, dark and oddly smoky atmosphere will keep me from going back again unless someone drags me there."}
{"text":"Turkey Reuben.  We were in town for one night and arrived around lunch.  After driving around for a bit and a small argument in the car, we decided on this place for lunch.  Since I had recently just started eating sauerkraut (I know, what the heck?) my new favorite sandwich that I have to try everywhere is a turkey Reuben.  We walked in, it was rather quiet, so we had our choice of spots and it was hot, so I made a beeline towards the table nearest the air conditioner.  We each ordered a drink and some deep fried pickles.  I got the turkey Reuben and my husband got something not a memorable.  The pickles were awesome as was my sandwich.  Nicely griddled and not too greasy.  In fact not long after, we were in town again for a concert and walked over here afterwards for a couple of beers.   Everyone on both trips were very nice and accommodating, with the other patrons friendly as well.  it's a must stop for bar food in Madison."}
{"text":"Went here for Friday fish fry. Waiter came to the table immediately. Ordered a Christmas brew that was on special, super cheap, and very tasty. Lots of tv's, laid back, cool vibe. Waiter was friendly, perfectly attentive without being overly so. We all three went for the cod, beer battered. I got red skinned potatoes as my side. They were great, but the fish was amazing. The beer batter was crispy, thick, and kept the fish inside super juicy. The waiter said they use loin of cod. One of the best battered fish I have ever had, hands down. Also the tartar sauce was different than I am used to, unique and flavorful. Best part, when the bill came, it was considerably less than I would have expected. I will be back!! Also they had specials most days, looking forward to trying the 50cent wings Mondays."}
{"text":"Man, I love this bar. Perfect neighborhood type bar, complete with regular patrons and colorful bartenders. The food is seriously stellar. They make their own ranch, which is to die for. My favorite is the eggs benedict on Sunday for brunch. THE BEST I've ever had in this city, and for only $8.00 The bloody mary bar is pretty great, too. Give it a shot. Oh, and there's a meat raffle at 3pm on Sundays, too."}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood hangout - the Carolina burger is to die for (either because it's awesome or your arteries have clogged beyond repair). Great brews, friendly staff, great food!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Saturday afternoon hangout. The service is great (Jess on the weekends, the owner at night, and the rest of the staff are all nice and helpful). The cheese curds and fried mushrooms are awesome, especially with the curry ranch. I love the bloody Mary bar, one of my favorite bloodys in Madison. A laid back place where I hang out with friends for a few hours. The bar is starting contests and traditions that will keep it a staple place for me."}
{"text":"Just called wanting info so I could seemless an order. I was trying to get soup for my sister who is very sick with the flu. She also has severe nut and soy allergies. The woman answering the phone could not tell me for certain whether or not the soups had nuts or soy! Now I still can't find soups for my sister, very bad customer service and allergy awareness."}
{"text":"This is such an unexpected surprise, in the best way possible!  I was expecting a dive and the interior give no atmosphere, but their menu and service are worthy of much more. The bartender/server introduced himself, asked for everyone's names, and when he explained their specialties, you can tell there's a lot of pride behind it.  Sure there's your typical bar and grill food, such as chicken tenders, burgers, and fried foods. But! Can you expect, a Mediterranean plate of hummus, feta cheese, kalamata olives, tomatoes, cucumbers and red onions served with grilled pita bread & drizzled with olive oil? Cajun jambalaya on Thursdays? How about the recent Friday night special they had of pan-fried Sole fish with lemon butter sauce?  Did you know their onion rings, fried mushrooms and friend pickles are all made in house?  They also try to get all their products and goods from local farmers and merchants. For example, their burger buns are from Madison sourdough.  Just amazing, I feel as if we are at a white linen table restaurant.  We opted for the Fish Fry and a friend ordered the Juicy Lucy burger, a burger stuffed with American and cheddar cheese.   The fish was phenomenal! The beer batter was crisp throughout, flavorful, per perfectly salted as to not to overpower the cod. All orders though, are a la cart. You can order sweet potato fries, regular fries or tots, great choices to your standards at most places. The burger lived up to the name, and cooked to par.  Ignore the exterior, and put all doubts aside, you have to try this place!  The also serve brunch on Saturdays and Sundays!"}
{"text":"Fun names for food and great taste! The only thing that wasn't that great was the waitress who took our order over the phone didn't understand we wanted delivery. Then we called back once realizing we didn't give our address and she rudely said 'we only do Mr. Delivery, your order is for pickup'. Sorry for the misunderstanding, but you could have handled the situation better. Other than that, the Jalape√±o stuffed burger will be bringing us back. Best stuffed burger in Madison."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the bar is great. It was set up for those who both wanted to eat and those who wanted to drink. The air conditioning was awfully two cold however, I had goosebumps after five minutes.   I tried the Philly Bubbie Burger, which was a stuffed burger filled with standard Philly toppings. The food was cooked well, but the burger was dry. The Grille claims to be the only place in Madison that serves Bubbie burgers, so I was expecting more in all honesty. The cheese curds were amazing, as always.  My biggest pet peeve when dinning out is when it takes longer to receive the check than it does to order/receive food. This was due to the fact there were only TWO employees for the entire place working. One bartender and one chef. There was easily 30 people. Overall it's a good place to grab some beer and some bar food but the management set the staff up to fail by not scheduling enough people."}
{"text":"Came to BSG after the lack of staff failed to acknowledge our party at the previous restaurant. It is a divey spot but that's okay and the yelpers reviews steered us right! Ordered apps to share ,fried pickles and cheese curds ,they were very good. I would not have chosen the fried pickles for myself but I will next time because BSG knows how to batter them! The jucy  Lucy was good and my son was ( with a teenagers appetite) able to finish the THOR burger despite the waitreses doubts!  They also kept our soda glasses full. Will stop in again to sample more shtuff."}
{"text":"This is my go-to neighborhood bar. Very friendly staff, good burgers, excellent fish fry (at least the lake perch - that's what I always get), and a nice draft beer selection.   The place is generally loud even if there aren't a lot of people there due to the acoustics but it's a great bar. They've even got a Sunday meat raffle."}
{"text":"It's a really hard call to make, but you've got my hard-won endorsement. I've tried a hell of a lot of them, everywhere I could. But didn't expect it to be at, of all places, some townie bar I ran in to in order to briefly avoid the snow.   Best Cheese Curds in Madison."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the food at Baldwin Street Grille. I went for breakfast with my boyfriend last Sunday. Our waitress was super friendly and had great recommendations. My boyfriend ordered the special Peach Cobbler French Toast, which was amazing! The chef came out and checked in to see how our food was, and proceeded to explain his inspiration for his creation. This place is a hidden gem! I will be returning in the future for breakfast and to try dinner :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and our server was Brian. Brian was very enthusiastic, shook our hands, asked for our names and used them the couple of times he passed by.   We ordered an appetizer, Cheese Curds, which took about 10-15 minutes to come out, which is understandable because they were fairly busy.   While waiting for the appetizer, Brian didn't come around and had taken up conversation with the table next to ours. After he finished the conversation and walked away, someone else brought our cheese curds and then he stopped by to ask how they were. After that, he disappeared. We finished the appetizer, my drink was almost empty, and we had to ask another employee to take our order-Dana.   Dana happily took our order and refilled my beverage. Brian still hasn't come to the table since delivering the cheese curds about 20 minutes ago and we haven't seen him on the floor but once since.   The atmosphere is fairly loud so it's hard to hold a conversation unless you're raising your voice to talk over the other customers."}
{"text":"\"Don't judge a book by its cover\"  This place is a true hidden gem, one of those places where you're afraid that writing a great review will ruin the place. But hey, they deserve the praise so I'll lay it on.  I bet you've driven past this place a hundred times and didn't know it was there. Maybe you thought it was a local run-down bar that had just closed a few hours earlier at 2am Sunday morning. BSG is a super-casual, no-frills, almost divey bar for a great brunch. A nice selection of breakfast dishes, sure to have something for everyone, and the quantities are quite generous. Everything was cooked well, served without delay, and the staff are awesome. Dude behind the bar kept us entertained and made sure everything was perfect. Will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place over the weekend.  On a recommendation from a friend, a group of us met up there for drinks and food on Saturday night.    The bartenders were great guys.  Nice, down to earth, and efficient.  The beer is cold and the mixed drinks are stirred to perfection.  While the outside may not look welcoming, the inside is clean, spacious, and has three big screen satellite TVs.  But, it's the burgers that created this review.  They're simple and delicious.  Try it on a poppy seed buns and with sweet potato fries. Perfect bar food. I couldn't ask for more.  My friend's recommendation was for the Friday Night Fish Fry which I'm excited to experience!"}
{"text":"Revisited three times in the last six months.  Very hit and miss.  One time, great bartender, reasonable noise level no problems other than it being a little hot.  Next time, walked in with a group and we all looked at each other and walked out because there was such a poop smell going on.  Plumbing problems?  I dunno but it was not worth staying to find out.  Had lunch there one time and it was fine pub food, without fecal odor.  I would visit often if the place was more consistent, was less loud and was not a sports bar.  But it ain't, so I don't.  Oh and after I put up my previous review someone at the establishment emailed me to offer a comp meal.  I don't think my opinion is particularly important, but it still seemed a little sketch."}
{"text":"Aeswome, craving for some sweet potato fries Sunday night. I called and they had it ready in 3 min. Good sweet potato fries!!!! it was little pricy for a side of sweet potato fries....$4 or 5 bucks. SO good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Two words: Tator Tots  This is an unsuspecting old tavern on E Wash and Baldwin with THE BEST Friday fish fry! This really is my favorite fish fry in town and I love that a side option is tator tots. I feel like a kid in my elementary school cafeteria (cuz my momma never made these at home).  Owner, Ryan, is usually tending bar and making extra effort to introduce himself to every patron in the place. He has tons of energy and wants everyone to have a great experience. I love what he's done with that corner and look forward to seeing it grow. It's a little divey on the inside, but the food and drinks are excellent and they even have somewhat modern dishes they use to serve the meals. I hope that means he's planning more investment in upgrading the tables, flooring, etc. as the business grows. I think he's going to need to give the place a facelift with Pasqual's moving in next door.  One thing my husband and I talked about as we left after our most recent visit was that there was quite a diverse crowd - young and old, different races and ethnicities, and everyone was having a good time watching the TVs (they usually have movies and sports playing simultaneously). I love that about Madison and this bar. Everyone is welcome and has a great time!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Baldwin Street Grille. We arrived about 7:30 on Friday night. We were able to get a table right away. My friend got a sandwich and I got the cod fish fry. Very good!  Plenty of food and cooked perfectly. Cheese curds were wonderful!  Service is spot on. Prices are very reasonable. It's loud. And there's no parking to speak of except on the street.  Plan to walk a few blocks after finding a spot."}
{"text":"What a surprisingly great spot.  Even after reading reviews, I was pleasantly surprised.  Very unassuming interior.  Variety of types of tables and chairs, almost like they shopped an auction.  Early saturday night was light on traffic, but regulars who welcomed us newbies.  Great jukebox.  Sign says kareoke on Thursdays, but once Pat Benetar came on, all females began singing along loudly.   Based on previous reviews, we did the Carolina burger and the juicy lucy.  my Carolina with sweet potato fries was delish and nearly perfect.  The juicy lucy was enjoyed, but the uniqueness of the cheese inside the burger was not preferred over a typical cheese burger, but others may enjoy. The side of tater tots with garlic mayo were \"awesome!\" Nice variety of micros on tap. Friendly staff, and very attentive.  We decided to stick around for a bit, and asked for a deck of cards and a cribbage board.  Mel delivered!  Having a cribbage board may now be our test for a \"great\" bar.  This place is a bar, no doubt, and just a great local neighborhood bar.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Not much to expect from the outside and has a \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere to it, but the food was stellar and the beer selection is nice. My gf and I tried the fish fry: both the perch and cod were on point and the curly fries were a plus. Great wings too!"}
{"text":"This place used to be the Friendly Tavern for decades and has changed names a few times since then. I haven't been here before and was pleasantly surprised. They have a big menu with lots of choices. I had a chicken sandwich that was an actual piece of white meat, not processed patty, and it was very good. My partner had a hamburger with coleslaw on it, I can't remember what it is called, and it too was very good. The service as well was great. They have both a big bar and eight or ten tables and the usual big screen TV's. The only thing I would complain about is that going out the back door, we were hit with a sheet of ice. This door is popular because there is only street parking and this is the closest door to it. No one bother to shovel the walkway after the storm and it is very slippery and dangerous. A law suite in the making. Give the place a shot if in the area. It's better than a lot of places with bar type food."}
{"text":"BSG is such a good, reliable lunch restaurant. They entire place has a really cozy feel and they do have an ATM in back if you need cash (although they take cards). If you don't get the smoked gouda mac & cheese bites, you are seriously missing out. A little bit of a dive, but always full of lots happy-looking people."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to BSG and I'd say most of the Yelp reviews are pretty spot on except we had great service. Definitely agree with the fact that it's freezing in there!!!  BSG was kind enough to host the UM alumni club's watching party for the game today (extra star for that!!! And I know, I know-you crazy Badger fans-that may be enough to turn you away-don't let it!). It's a smaller space and we had four of the tables. The rest of the place was filled with brunchers. Despite being pretty packed, our service was great and they split checks no problem.   Yes, the exterior (and interior) is rough around the edges but who cares? Plenty of TVs, friendly staff, surprisingly excellent beer selection (90 minute IPA and fantasy factory both on tap!) and good food. They also had a DIY Bloody Mary bar which many in our party enjoyed. Everyone enjoyed their food. I split the Juicy Lucy with a friend and it was average. Another tackled the Thor and loved it.   Tots are good but nothing special. Where they really excelled were the dipping sauces of which there are many choices including some unique ones such as avocado ranch. We had the garlic aioli and Sriracha aioli, the latter of which was awesome.    A big thanks to the owner for having us!!! I'll be back UM game or not :)"}
{"text":"Awesome local find on a Sunday in Madison, WI! And the Packers are playing adding to the vibe."}
{"text":"Baldwin Street Grille looks like a dive bar, but they had a great fish fry. Only 4 stars because they need to figure out how to have more tables. It was very crowded and we had to wait awhile to sit down. I had the perch with sweet potato fries and cheese curds. I really wanted perch and it was the only place I could find that offered it. Glad we tried this place out. We will be back."}
{"text":"A new review of an old Madison tavern!  Several craft brews on tap.  Great burgers!  They have a separate menu of \"stuffed burgers\", which you definitely need to check out if you are an adventurous burger guru.  The onion rings are homemade and AWESOME!  They have a great batter and plenty of sauces to try as well.  We did not try it, but the deep fried mushrooms are fresh and just as good as the onion rings per the bar staff!  The burgers we did have were as expected, a great bar burger!"}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better.  More room, better food, great service. The staff to a person are friendly and eclectic. The owner asks how things are in a sincere way. No longer a dive bar, the serve an awesome Cobb Salad.  Stop in if you want good bar food and relaxed environment."}
{"text":"Perfect place for Sunday-Funday in Madison!  Especially when the packers are playing, this pub is rocking.  Great beer/cider selection, good whiskeys, and plenty of free shots for every packers score.  They also do some great raffle give a ways during the game with local meats and cuts.  Food is also amazing; I would definitely recommend the standard burger (just really, really, good beef; doesn't need tons of toppings or sauces), the sweet potato fries are wonderful, and the fried cheese curds with the advocado ranch sauce are a perfect addition."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  I waited three days to write this review.    I walk into this establishment and it was a little divey. That is not a bad thing, especially for me. However, when you advertise on your website, a \"welcoming environment\", please make sure you clean your tables. It took a few minutes but we were eventually greeted by the bartender/server. At this point, it was not busy. There were three of us, with a few more to join. So we made sure to tell her we were on two separate tabs.   I have no idea what our server/bartender's name was because she never introduced herself. She did not know what the special was. She actually asked us to get up and read the sign ourselves. We ordered food as well. A few minutes pass, no drinks. Two beers and a glass of wine nowhere to be found. However, we do see her doing a shot with some patrons. We will call this SHOT 1.   She then comes over to tell us she does not know what she wrote. It says side bleu cheese. My friend explains it was her side salad. Ok. No problem, people forget things sometimes. We FINALLY get our drinks. The bar is still not busy. Food comes out. She puts a burger with onion rings in front of the person who order an appetizer basket of onion rings. She gives me a salad. I ordered nothing. Luckily, after some rearranging and catching her to explain a few things, our food situation is settled.   We were never offered a second drink. However, I did see the bartender talking to some people and taking SHOT 2!  So we decided to just close our tabs and move on. And this began the 30 minute sit. During this time, I was able to witness the bartender take SHOT 3 AND SHOT 4. And me?  Just sitting waiting to ask for my tab. I wish I were exaggerating, but I was not. When we got there, we joked that the bartender was so spacey she must be drunk. Nope. Not a joke, she had to be drunk.  So I finally get the tab. There is a wrong item on it and two tabs were also merged together. She did not know which drink I had, what items should be on what tab (even after I explained it to her) and she did not come back to check on me. The rest of the people who joined us were still finishing their pitcher of beer. She asked me to have them close because she was leaving soon. Ok, no problem.  However, she took so much time to close all of our tabs that we realized she was going nowhere. Why lie?  You don't want to be bothered with a table?  You still serve food at 8. So this should not be an issue. It took everyone about 45 minutes to close tabs. That is unacceptable. It took more time to close my tab than to drink my drink. The bartender was rude. It did get busier but that is the nature of the business. During this time, she did have time to take SHOT 5!"}
{"text":"The good bits: The food, for what it is, is really great. Great pub food, particularly the cheese curds. They have a juicy lucy (burger with the cheese inside the patty), which sets them apart a bit in my book. Really, for this type of food, this is a great bet. Also it's not overly greasy, which is great.   The bad bits: I'm not one who needs a fancy interior or needs a restaurant to be dead quiet, but the inside of this place leaves something to be desired. I'm fine with a place where the jukebox is playing or there's a TV with a game on. This place has no fabric inside whatsoever which leaves you with the feeling you're sitting in something like a cinderblock box. This also makes it so that all the sound in there bounces off of the walls and it becomes quite loud as a result. When we were there, it wasn't particularly crowded, yet it felt as though there were a hundred people in there due to the volume. It was hard to talk to the person sitting next to you at the table.   The food really is good, but I probably won't be back. For me this is one of those \"Ok, I know what that place is about now\" joints."}
{"text":"This is another place that's taken me too long to get to - but I'm very glad I finally made it.  Baldwin Street Grille is one of the most unpretentious bars I've been to.  Divey and a little rough around the edges without trying to be hipster (although hipsters who like good beer and pub food should come here too).  If you show up in a suit and tie, you'll probably be the only one, but I doubt anyone would look at you funny.    The bartenders and the owner are incredibly friendly.  It probably sounds clich√© but I felt like a regular on my first visit.  They have a nice tap list with a good local representation.      The fish fry was fantastic!  Cod loins were perfectly breaded - satisfyingly crispy without that heart attack on a plate feeling.  Definitely something I'll be having again, and based on how good it is, I'm looking forward to checking out the other menu items."}
{"text":"Finally got around to stopping by for their Friday Night fish fry and it was excellent. Delightful service,  pleasant ambiance and crisp deep fried cod, very lightly breaded lake perch good slaw, pub chips, roasted red potatoes all with sides of Sriracha and blue cheese dipping sauces as well as a unique and delicious tartar sauce. And the perfect accompaniment to a fish fry, a slice of rye bread!  Why was I thrilled with the rye bread?  Because back in the day, my folks always served rye bread with fish because, as my dad said, if you start choking on a fish bone, you eat the rye bread to clear your throat and save your life."}
{"text":"Baldwin Street Grille is quickly becoming one of my favorite dive bars in Madison. We have only been there twice, but both times the food and the service have been absolutely amazing. The decor is definitely not why you go to Baldwin Street Grille.  We really enjoy coming on Fridays for their fish fry. Both my fiance and I got the Cod and Sweet Potato fries. You normally get two large pieces of Cod. They ran out on my order so to make up for it, I got one big piece of Cod and a huge piece of perch. Both were great. We also ordered the Gouda Mac and Cheese bites which were fricken amazing!! The rest of the menu also looks good but we have not had the chance to try anything else yet.  Baldwin Street Grille also has a pretty good selection of beers on tap and reasonably priced mixed drinks available which we both enjoy.  Ryan is the owner and operator and both times we have visited he is always multi tasking by serving food and drinks as well as checking in with the guest to make sure things are good. Hence we feel the service is top notch.   We definitely plan on going back more often!"}
{"text":"What the hey!??? How come I have never heard of this place before?  Went here for a date night with my boyfriend (we've been together 13 years so date night is mostly about good food- less cheesy romantic sh*t).  The burger was delicious- buttery bun. I had chili which was also wonderfully tasty.  The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy.  My whiskey coke was strong.  Decor is not fancy but who cares- food is good!  Bartender lady was super nice....not too overbearing- just whatever- I like that.  There is one pool table, some video gambling things.  Best of all- they have karaoke on Thursday nights.  I haven't checked out karaoke yet but gonna do it this Thursday.  Also, Tuesday is 25 cent wings- really yummy and cheap.  I love this place- one of my new fav places in Madison- truly local spot- if you like Caribou Tavern, you'll love Baldwin St. Grille."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful neighborhood bar in the land of re-development on the East Washington corridor. Having visited for brunch, dinner, and Wisconsin sporting events I can say it's an all-around great place for any occasion.   Their website offers the notion that this is a place \"where you are only a stranger once\" and it's completely genuine. Staff hasn't changed much in the few years I've been a guest here, and it is a welcoming environment where staff takes good care of their patrons.  My favorites about BSG are their 50cent wings on Monday nights, the brunch offerings in general, their fire-breathing bartenders, and the true Wisconsin atmosphere especially during Packers games when free shots are distributed when the Pack scores.  The only downfall is finding seating during popular sports events, otherwise it's an all around fantastic option!"}
{"text":"The embarrassment of East Wash is getting an upgrade. And what an upgrade it is! They added about 100 square feet of space for the bedraggled to bump into each other.   Being across the street from shopbop and just down from the shiny new buildings you'd think the place could gravitate away from soulless psuedo sports bar mish mash towards something actually creative or attempting to do something vaguely unique. Rooftop seating? New facade? Bueller?   The food isn't bad when you can get someone's attention at lunch. At night it's a bunch of sad saps contemplating suicide by booze. Why can't we have something better. Oh god why."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Tuesday night and was not disappointed.I had the BSG Wrap and my boyfriend the Philly. The food was excellent and the service fantastic. Our bartender/server was friendly and prompt. Decent beer/wine prices, and the wine wasn't bad for a small bar. Only complaint was our table was pretty sticky. Will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"This place looks pretty unassuming from outside. I went there on a Friday night. Had trouble finding the door, was worried it wasn't even open. Started to be concerned that I invited my friends out for dinner to a place that wasn't open and that I would find them outside, grumpy in the neg. degree weather. But I shouldn't have fretted! Finally found the door and walked into a happening, inviting place.  It was Friday, so I had to go with the fish fry. They had both cod and perch available. The perch is sort of a flaky crust on the outside but the cod has a beer battered crust . So if you are looking for a that crunchy layer of goodness surrounding your fish. Go with the cod!! it was delicious. They use the loin which is a nice piece of meat.  They have drink specials and specials every night of the week in terms of food. 50 cent wings on Mondays! I'm definitely going to be coming back. Such great food at such a chill place. Definitely a great place to come to if you are a sports fan they have a TV for practically every customer in the place. The service that night was great I thought even though some other reviewers said it was a hit or miss. I thought with it being pretty crowded we were waited on in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I don't get what all they hype is about by other Yelpers. I just ordered and consumed a Juicy Lucy burger and sweet potato fries. The fries were ok and the highlight of the meal.   I get the stuffed burger concept of the Juicy Lucy - I've even been to a joint called the Juicy Lucy on the Wisconsin - Minnesota boarder.   The Juicy Lucy I had at the Baldwin Grill was over pattied, over cooked with an off-putting  texture. The beef itself had a sort of meatloaf flavor. It wasn't a fresh a fresh tasting burger. It was anything but juicy.    Others in my group ordered burgers and said they were OK, but did mention that for $8-10 a burger the burgers seemed a bit pricey for an unremarkable bar burger. All of this said the place is packed on a Tuesday night.   Like I said, I've been to Baldwin Street Grill a couple of times - no need to come back for food. If you want a great burger - the best burger in Madison, head over to Player's a few blocks away.   In closing - I hate to pan a locals joint. I love locals joint... I'd say it's safe to say Baldwin Street Grill is fine if you are after the quintessential Wisconsin bar experience. Come on - they have a meat raffle - that's a plus. As I write this Hendrix is playing... I'm really feeling badly the food wasn't better."}
{"text":"Unassuming and a totally townie bar- give it a chance because you won't be disappointed- get the burger- the Carolina or Juicy Lucy."}
{"text":"Great beer and food selection! Never had fried mushrooms before but would definitely try them again!"}
{"text":"Their food, drinks, and atmosphere are good. They are very welcoming when you come in. However, when they are busy or they don't know you it can be difficult to get a drink.   Their .50 cent wings on Monday's are legit! Their stuff cheeseburgers are like no other. I would say to at least visit them once to see whether you like them or not. It's a divey place and they're worth the try."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place so many times, disappointed I just now figured out what I was missing. The meat raffle was incredibly entertaining with solid choices. Really wish we could've stayed till the end but it was a little long.   We came back on a week night and tried their food. The jambalaya special was delicious with the perfect amount of spice. Healthy portion size as well. The Gouda mac n cheese bites were ridiculously good. Beer is cold and drinks are strong enough. Excellent service despite being busy."}
{"text":"We heard that the burgers were good. We walked over as we just moved into the neighborhood and we were excited to give it a try. After sitting at the bar for over 10 minutes, no one behind the bar said HI to us, or even said they'd be a few minutes or anything. We did not acknowledge us whatsoever. There we only 5 people sitting at the bar. HUGE bummer."}
{"text":"Baldy's has by far the BEST Meat Raffle in Madison. It is Sunday's at 3:00 pm. They use Jennifer St. Market meat so you know you are getting quality stuff. The announcer is what makes it awesome! He is so high energy you can't help but have a great time. You are going to win something because you have like 1 in 7 chances of winning. First prize gets a piece of meat, second wins a $10 drink chip, 3rd wins a $5 drink chip, and the next 4 numbers win a shot. Also their food is great! Beyond just bar food, its quality eats."}
{"text":"Living close to Tenney Park this is one of the closest bar/restaurants you will find.  The decor might be a little dated but the food is great and the drinks are strong.  I have always found the staff to be friendly and helpful.  The owner in particular goes out of his way to shake hands and introduce himself to new customers.  This is really a neighborhood bar that welcomes all, even if you aren't from the neighborhood you will want to come back.  Also check out their awesome weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something new so I stopped here after work on a Tuesday night. The bartender was very attentive, service was quick, and the food was excellent. The smoked Gouda mac & cheese bites are life-changing - these alone are worth going back for. BSG is definitely a dive bar but it is very well kept and the kind of place I would be a regular at if I lived on that side of town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Always a good time at the 'Grille. Stopped in for a quick after-Yelp-event beer this afternoon with some folks, but I've been here for their very fun karaoke nights (some of the bartenders put on an impressive show) and excellent fish fry several times. The staff is super friendly and attentive, the drinks are good, fairly priced and generously poured, the crowd is eclectic, and it all just works. Today our server, Jessica, was very convincing that we needed to come back for Saturday or Sunday brunch because it is excellent. I'm down! If you go for dinner, drinks or snacks, try the fried pickles. Hand battered dill spears are hot, spicy, not greasy, and just right."}
{"text":"I love this joint, SO much.   I've come for brunch on quite a few Sundays. The Bloody Marys are outstanding, and the brunch special is always fantastic. My friends and I love the Eggs Benedict and French Toast.   If you're ever nearby, don't be put off by the building's aesthetic. It looks like a dive bar, for sure, but don't be fooled - their kitchen can bust out some 5-star brunch, for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once for a burger and fries in the middle of a Saturday (with no big sports events happening) and again for a Friday fish fry.  It's a very casual, neighborhood atmosphere. There are many TVs and music playing. Orders are taken at the table.  The food was good - especially the burger. The others in my party had the perch. It was GIANT, larger than any perch ever gets in nature. They didn't love the how fish to batter ratio.  The service on both visits was a little awkward (I think that's the best word), even though the restaurant wasn't crowded. There was a small wait to order. We had to wait for/request someone to refill our drinks (and on old fashioned was delivered without cherries) and pay our bill."}
{"text":"Big statement coming at ya.   You ready for this Madison?   Baldwin Street Grille has the best... THE BEST food I've ever eaten at a hole in the wall type townie feeling pub. And I'm not talking about just Madison! Are they going to be Michelin rated? No. But what they're doing works. It's just solid, and for me that gets 5 stars.   I ate. And ate. And ATE, so I feel safe saying something so strong having had their hand breaded deep fried mushrooms, Carolina Burger with sweet potato fries, mixed greens salad and hot wings. I don't know why I was so ravenous, but I'm glad Robin knows a thing or two about cooking because everything rocked, and it's amazing that he by himself is able to turn things out so quick.   Ryan behind the bar is always up for some convo and will want to know your name. Don't be scurrr'd. Shake the guy's hand and get chatting.   Although your \"bar burger\" is going to be on a real plate, like a ceramic one, these two gents are anything but fancy. The place is super chill, has enough TVs so everyone will be happy watching whatever it is that gets them going, and the equivalent of an ipod looking juke on the wall plays decent tunes on the cheap.   I had it in mind to grab a beer and maybe some fries but drank 3 and ate a third of the menu. It's just a cool place to be and I hear their fish fry on Friday is bomb!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute place. Relatively small menu but there are plenty of options and something for everyone. The food is also presented really nicely. I love the set up also. The bar has lots of seating but there are tables and booths if you prefer.  All the bartenders that have ever served us there have been awesome. Super nice and fun. Overall we love this place.  Great place to bring out of town friends for dinner or just to go hang out for a few drinks."}
{"text":"I literally only come here when one of friends insists that we go even though it's right next to where I live. It's a place where I'm cool with eating at, but don't really like drinking at. The music is just not my taste (it definitely also is a place that fills with regulars). They do have a pool table, it normally is occupied at night (on the weekend from my experience) but you can maybe get in a game if you're lucky.  Brunch on the weekend is pretty good. There is a decent amount of options from omelets to crepes. They also have a build your own Bloody Mary bar which is always fun! The staff is helpful and friendly and there are normally specific specials happening that day. Since they remodeled, it does feel more spacious compared to before!  I would definitely give it a chance (no need to be weary based on how it looks outside)"}
{"text":"Great fish fry in an unexpected location!  The fried perch is crisp and juicy inside without being soggy or oily. My dining companion was wow-ed and said it reminded him of fond childhood perch memories (how often do you get to have that, eh?).  The sweet potato fries were particularly good as well; actually tasted of sweet potato without being dry.   Our server/bartender was very friendly and helpful, although at one time we had to flag him down.  Overall, will go back for fish fry.  BTW, the music playing was Jock Jams. Very loudly.  Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to you."}
{"text":"Food was so greasy that I got sick after eating there. Service was friendly, though, which earned then an extra star."}
{"text":"Baldwins is great. Good food, good beer, good employees. I've gotten the wings a couple of times and have walked away satisfied every time. They have a variety of sauces and are cooked to perfection.   They have tv's everywhere and just recently renovated. Baldwins is a great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of the regular Yelpers had given this place very good reviews, and since it was also close to my wife's work I decided to give it a try.  I'm not quite sure why everyone is so wild about it, but it has a few things going in the right direction.   The location is near downtown, so for most I'd say that's pretty agreeable.  The building looks really shabby though and the sign is so small that I walked past it once before realizing where it was.  The inside didn't impress much either; just an old bar with a pool table.  Our servers were very friendly and polite, and the service was relatively prompt in contrast to some of the other reviews I read.  Beer prices were completely reasonable for a Friday, I believe I had $3.50 Millers if I remember correctly.  I had the cheese curds for an appetizer and the fried cod with red potatoes for my meal.  The curds were delicious, and the sriracha mayo sauce that came along with it was a nice touch.  The bowl was quite small though, probably about a dozen curds or so in total.    The cod and potatoes were good, definitely worth your time.  Not my favorite, probably not in my top 5, but good.  The Avenue Bar down the street and Midtown Pub are probably the best in Madison (in my opinion), but I'd eat the fish here again.  This is one of those places that I'd like to make a return visit to and could see myself upping the star count on, but I'm a little bummed about the atmosphere.  I realize that \"towny bar\" is where it's trying to get its draw from, but it was a bit too much of a dive for my taste.  If I'm going to go to a towny bar, I'd like towny bar prices, and our heavy bill didn't reflect that.  Granted we had a few beers, but it was a lot more than I expected, and for that price I'd go down the street.  The menu has quite a few enticing options though, so we'll see what the future holds. . ."}
{"text":"Stellar Staff coupled with killer grub and reasonably priced beer/cocktails! 6 Stars if available!"}
{"text":"You might drive down East Wash and never even notice this place but it's a gem. Great food, strong servers. Their new menu is really delicious. I had a beautiful house salad and fried Mac and cheese bites and was delighted by both picks. The sriracha aioli is delicious. Love it!"}
