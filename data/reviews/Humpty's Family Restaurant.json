{"text":"Went with a friend for lunch. The restaurant is very clean and bright & a wonderful place to sit & chat. Service was excellent.  The server we had not only knew the menu very well,  but offered me some excellent options to suit my gluten free diet. But, best of all, she was super friendly!  The food came out hot & quick and was exactly as ordered. I ordered breakfast for lunch & was so happy.  I've been here before & can say this restaurant can be counted on to be pretty reliable.  I'll keep coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Pretty generic to all other Humpty's restaurants. Same decor and menu.  They one thing that sets this location apart is the superb service. The servers here truly care about their customers and their jobs. A rare gem.  The food is always fast, and steaming hot."}
