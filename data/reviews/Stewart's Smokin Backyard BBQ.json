{"text":"Honestly I can't remember how I came to find Stewart's but I needed catering for a party I was having. I ordered the baby back ribs, pulled chicken, baked beans and macaroni and cheese. The food was outstanding, arrived hot and on time. Included was serving utensils and plates and napkins. Devan was very professional and easy to work with. I would recommend them."}
