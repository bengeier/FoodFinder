{"text":"OUTSTANDING diner near quaint downtown Waxhaw. Great food (and PLENTY of it!) wonderful wait staff, and fast service. Quality, quality quality! EAT HERE SOON AND OFTEN! There were 5 diners and a child in our party and each had the same great review..."}
{"text":"I come to this location all the time and I've always had EXCELLENT customer service! The servers, hosts, and all other workers are polite and so great. You can always be assured that your food will come out piping hot, fresh, and DELICIOUS! Writing this review has me craving them again!"}
{"text":"I will never be back. The OWNER chased out to our car calling us \"assholes\" & said we were funny looking. No matter how bad your day is going you should never treat your customers that way. I am horrified by the owner & his terrible customer service."}
{"text":"We heard about STACKS over and over. Finally made it there ourselves this morning for brunch-late breakfast around 11:00. Some folks waiting on line so we sat at the counter-great way to watch the cooks and the action. AND we introduced ourselves to owners, such nice people, very accommodating and cordial! Hey they're from Jersey and we're from Jersey! You from Jersey?  I had the thick Challah bread (made onsite) french toast topped with strawberries and blueberries and a dollop of whipped cream. Delish. My husband had the \"lumberjack\" (remember that sit from Monte Python? \"I am a lumberjack\". Anyway, he loved it and couldn't finish it all; it was a big boy breakfast.   Traffic moved in and out quickly and droves of people kept coming. Stacks serves breakfast all day long and closes at 3:00 pm.  So don't worry about getting there any special time. I want to try the blintzes next time. Yes, there will be many times that we will pop in for a deliciously satisfying breakfast.  They serve lunch too, haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Stacks is a great neighborhood spot where the food is good and plentiful, the staff is welcoming, it's our go to spot at least once a week!  Both locations are equally good, it's well worth waiting on line for!"}
{"text":"Great food great folks.  Very family friendly atmosphere.  There is a reason at times there is a short wait to be seated!!"}
{"text":"First stop for food in Charlotte (or the surrounding areas rather) and it was amazing! Staff was super friendly and attentive. The portions were massive and really fresh. We're new to the area and if this is a preview of the locals I can't wait to be one!"}
{"text":"Love the new location. Still great food and service, but now the atmosphere is much better. The food always is fresh and plentiful.  A restaurant is always better when the owner is there, and it seems George is always there. Great for Breakfast and Lunch."}
{"text":"Went there at 11:00 am planning to get lunch but ended getting a Taylors Ham sandwich off the breakfast menu, it was very good and a deal for $5.25.  The place was still pretty busy for 11:00 am , seems like a locals favorite.  Would recommend for breakfast or burgers and wraps for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Yummy! Pig portions so beware.  We had the fresh squeezed orange juice so worth it, Popeyes skillet and eggs and sausage links.  The sausage is not your traditional Breakfast sausage and is milder tasting with no sage.  Breads are home made including toast which was incredible."}
{"text":"I was excited about Stacks opening a restaurant in Matthews, until I went there for Mother's Day and the following weekend.  They were packed on Mother's Day, so we decided to get a take out order for 8 individuals.  Even though they insisted on having double checked the order, they neglected to us 3 of the 8 orders placed.  I was hoping  that this was an isolated incident, so we went back the following weekend. Sadly, the service was bad and it took almost 40 mins to get simple breakfast dishes after we placed our order.  On this return trip we only had 4 in our party.  Hope things get better, otherwise I predict a closed sign on their door in the future."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there this morning.  Stacks advertises \"good food and plenty of it\".  I have to say they are true to their word.  Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Way too noisy and slow getting our breakfast. The eggs were not hot. Pancakes were excellent. When I went to the register to pay, I notice blackboard specials and my wife's egg plate was up there but they charged me menu price. I asked the woman at register why I was charged menu price only to be told \"something to do with amount of bacon\". Really? I won't be going back even if it's the only choice in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"I'm probably going to feel awful for leaving a less than stellar review as I'm generally an overly kind and complimentary person by nature, but I wasn't impressed with my experience here. The food was very bland for all guests in our party, and though we were starving, no one ate much. The coffee was not good at all either. A bit pricey as well, so I expected much better quality."}
{"text":"Stacks was great when they were in their older and smaller location. I anxiously awaited their larger space so the wait wouldn't be so long on weekend mornings. Their customer base not only went with them but must have grown because they still always have a wait on weekends. It's worth it though. Great food, great service, great prices."}
{"text":"With a name like Stacks, one can expect a laser-like focus on quality pancakes. In this regard, Stacks succeeds quite well. As for the rest...it's astonishingly mediocre.  I love greasy spoons. Stacks fits the greasy spoon moniker very well. But the attraction for me has to be this: if it's the kind of place that makes me drop what I'm doing and head over there right now because I've got a jones for their fare...well, Stacks just ain't that place, and that's a shame. As I mentioned, their pancakes are top-notch, but the rest of their menu seems pretty blah and uninspired. Nothing spectacular. Yet overpriced. There's no reason why 3 pancakes and a plate of scrambled eggs and 2 strips of bacon should run me $13 at a greasy spoon. No reason at all.  And one more thing, and I'm going to say this as plainly as possible: THEIR COFFEE IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. TERRIBLE. HEINOUS. It's not even hot water. It's simply foul. I can't enjoy a breakfast without a good cup of joe.   Dear Stacks: you are failing in the Quality Greasy Spoons Department if you keep serving up that shitty coffee. Actually, calling that coffee \"shitty\" is an insult to shitty coffee. There are no words to describe - I tried, above - just how utterly dire their coffee is. Call me a conspiracy theorist, or simply paranoid, but their coffee tastes as if it's been rebrewed. Over and over again. Trust me, I know what that tastes like. I've worked in restaurants where cheap-assed owner rebrew coffee and serve 2-day old bread. Now, I'm not accusing the ownership of Stacks of any corner-cutting. Far from it. Actually, the owners are super nice. My apologies if I've offended you. But your coffee offends me.  You're going to find long lines/waits on weekends, and I'll attribute the wait to Stacks being the only greasy spoon in town.   Okay, whatever. I'll probably go back, if I have nothing better to do."}
{"text":"I had heard and read all the accolades for this restaurant so this morning I decided to oder carry-out so that my family could enjoy the meal comfortably at home still in our PJs. Anyways the food was not that great. My french toast was dry and had no evidence of being sprinkled with powder sugar. The scrambled eggs with cheese did not resemble scrambled eggs with but look more like an omelet wrapped with cheese. The eggs were dry. Pancakes average. My entire family was not impressed. We are not from here but it seems that people are easy to impress. The breakfast restaurants like Wild Eggs would put this place to shame! IHOP in Ballantyne is better than this. It was our first and last time and we live in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"Stacks is great! We love the food at Stacks. The sandwiches the french toast, its all great. But come with an appetite cos you will get stuffed.  And its great to have a Northeast style diner here in Waxhaw.   In a town full of awesome places to eat, this one fits right in."}
{"text":"Love this place but plan on waiting on a Sunday if you get there much past 11am. Fresh squeezed orange juice is great!"}
{"text":"The food looked good, but had hair in french toast. Service was great and we wanted to give another chance because of service. But when the second order also had a hair we doubt the quality of food coming out of kitchen."}
{"text":"A perfect place to have breakfast or lunch. They have freshly squeezed orange juice, pancakes and waffles with fresh fruit. Friendly management and staff. Waxhaw, NC is lucky to have this little gem."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast I've ever had! The bacon was crisp, the eggs cooked to perfection and the bagels, ohhhh the bagels! I've never had a bagel so good in all my life!!! Eat here. Often. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This is amazing breakfast food. The portions are plentiful and delicious. They give you so much hash browns and it's crispy perfect. I would love to go back. Water taste slightly funny. They waitress we had was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Fresh and hospitality.  The build is old and crowed it needs restoration and a bigger place.  Employees are nice and the place is family oriented.  The prices are a little bit high for breakfast."}
{"text":"We typically visit the Stack's in Matthews (it's closer to us), but decided to venture out to the original in Waxhaw this past weekend.  Glad we had our GPS because it was hidden in the corner of a strip plaza.  The restaurant was very nice inside (maybe a little nicer than Matthews).  It was nicely decorated, laid out, and clean.  They offered the same great service and excellent food (at a very reasonable price) that we expect from Stack's.  It was worth the drive.    I ordered one of my \"usuals\": the Tuscany omelette.  Filled with sausage, provolone cheese, red peppers, and spinach, it satisfies my breakfast craving.  It came with a side of their perfectly cooked hashbrowns (or you can get grits or oatmeal), and toast, made from their out-of-this-world, thick-sliced homemade bread.  Get there early on the weekends, because there can be a wait!"}
{"text":"My family and I were looking forward to trying this place based on the rave reviews it's gotten over the years. However, we were very disappointed. The service was poor and the food was nothing more than things you can get from the grocery store's frozen food isle. There were flies flying around the entire restaurant and the waitresses barely took time away from counting their tips to see if customers were satisfied with their order. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. The place is not all that it's been made out to be."}
{"text":"Pancakes (yes) Bacon (yes) Hash (yes) Eggs (yes) coffee, hot cocoa even great crayons for the kids to color with (and we may have eaten those too )   A hundred times yes yes yes...the grits are creamy the biscuits are slap yo momma good!  I'm sure their is a team of old country ladies cooking their hearts out because this food was cooked with so much heart and soul it makes you happy and the team goes above and beyond to serve you.    I loved my first experience and will absolutely go back.  I even bought a t-shirt because I wanted a souvenir to give my boss...a fellow bacon lover.  Great job Stacks Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today and had breakfast.  Old school diner kind of feel.  Staff was very helpful and on top of there game.  Had the Eggs benedict and was awesome hash browns were good I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Stack's is a great spot for Breakfast/ Lunch I have been a handful of times - my sister lives down that way. Every time I have gone for Breakfast we have to wait but its not that bad and it moves pretty quick! The food is good and fast! I really haven't had anything that I didn't like so I will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!! Highly recommend the pancakes, French toast, waffles and omelettes!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Stack's it was very amazing! I was waited on by the waitress named Callie she was an awesome waitress she was very patient and my drink was always refilled which is a change I will definitely be back very soon for her service!"}
{"text":"great breakfast spot. we went on a saturday am and waited about 20 minutes. Worth the wait..great omelets, pancakes and loved the orange juice. We def would go back."}
{"text":"My family lives close to this Waxhaw Stacks location. They are always busy, but it truly is because of how good they are, with their food and their service! They always do their best to seat you in a timely manner, even on  super busy mornings. I have also gotten takeout from here, and I have never waited longer than 20mins after calling my order in (that time was near the holidays). I recommend the Stuffed French Toast, and the (seasonal) Pumpkin pancakes."}
{"text":"After waiting for nearly an hour for our table and being told they \"forgot to put us on the list\" we finally were seated. We waited for over 45 minutes and our food came out cold. We told the owner about our experience and said we would eat the food because we had waited for so long but just wanted to let him know, he said he'd take care of it. Well when our bills came out we were actually overcharged. When we asked to speak to the owner again they said \"he's in the kitchen and can't come out\" he finally came out after making us wait and said \"ok, what do you want. A free meal Or something? \" We insisted that we pay but it was the principle of how our visit went. In a very condescending and rude manor he said to us \"your food wasn't actually cold.\"  He then proceeded to chase us out the door calling us assholes, telling us we \"looked funny\" and that we could \"wash his dishes\" if we needed a job. I've never actually written a bad yelp review but this needed to be shared. Such a bummer because we used to go there often but will NEVER be back. It's sad to me that people feel they can act a certain way just because they are the \"owner\". If they need a dish washer, maybe he should go back to that, customer service is obviously not his strength! In other news, our server was great!"}
{"text":"Very Good. Had Farther's Day breakfast with my favorite Middle daughter. The corn beef hash was just the right amount with hardly any filler. There was a bit of a wait perhaps because of father's day.  My Daughter got the Big Daddy Skillet. Very good as well. Be hungry when you get this one though. A good nap could overtake you right after.   Will eat here again."}
{"text":"The food is very good but it's so ccrowded it's hard for them toreally focus on you especially on week mornings.it takes over an hour to get out on weekend  mornings but if you have time it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"Love me some Stacks Kitchen!!! It gets super busy Sat/Sun mornings, so go before 9am or you'll wait up to an hour (or more after 10!!). This is also a newer location as they moved here from another just down the street a year or two ago....newer location is much cleaner, so go back if you haven't been to this one in the strip mall!  The food here is always great! It reminds me a little of a 'northeastern diner' but it has southern charm & style! Servers are always on top of everything, a super staff here!  All the food I've tried here has been great, very fresh. We mostly go for breakfast, but occasionally for a lunch sandwich too. Never disappointed.   On rare occasions, food can take a bit long, usually when it's overly busy."}
{"text":"This was our second visit at this Waxhaw location. It's not one we visit often because it's a bit of a hike from us but it's worth a trip when we can.   It's a cute atmosphere with attentive waitstaff. Our orders we placed and served promptly, everything came out correct. Anything we asked for was brought on the spot. Drinks stayed full... almost too full :)   Pricing is fairly low which is nice when you have a family of five. Bathrooms were clean which is imperative with little ones.  Nice job Stacks!!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location twice and each time the experience has been satisfactory. The wait staff is friendly and attentive and the food has been good. I got to enjoy lunch this time and ordered the triple decker chicken salad BLT and fries. My food along with the rest of my families was served to us in a timely manner and was freshly prepared. Our drinks stayed full and we left happily with our bellies full! What more can you ask for!! We will definitely return here when we visit the Waxhaw area."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for many years.  The last few times, we have noticed that not only the service has went down hill, the food is as well.  We have never had good waitress service here, but always came back because the food was delicious.  We have eaten here 3 times in the last two weeks.  Our visit today was the worst!  When we first came in, we were seated promptly but took 8 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us or come for our drink order.  When she took our meal order, we had two simple requests -- well done hash browns, no onions.  It took 27 minutes for our food to be served.  When we started eating, we realized our hash browns were not well done and there were onions in the burrito.   Our waitress NEVER came back to check on us.  The owner was having a long conversation with a table near us.  He deliberately did not look at us. What amazes me the most is every time we check out, the cashier NEVER asks the typical \" was everything ok?\"  We think it is because she knows the answer!  It was horrible!  As I said, we used to put up with the bad service because the food was outstanding, sadly this is no longer the case."}
{"text":"Wow. I didn't have really high expectations when we found ourselves waiting in line for a table last Saturday...especially given that they looked like \"the only game in town\" for Breakfast/Brunch in Waxhaw.  However,  as we stood there waiting, I kept seeing all these plates of yummy looking food being delivered all around us. Then I noticed the chalk board with specials...and started to re-think my initial impression.  I think our wait for a table was around 30 mins... which isn't bad considering how busy they were.   So once we were seated, time to really focus on the task at hand: deciding what to eat. I must say, their menu is impressive.... if you can't find something that appeals to you here, I don't think you can find it anywhere!   I am a huge fan of yummy breakfast & go to a lot of places that serve only b-fast & lunch. I can't tell you how many times I have been bummed out to find a limited menu that  does not interest me. Thankfully that was not the case here.  I saw a lot on their menu that appealed to me and I had a tough time deciding what to try.   For this visit, I ordered the red velvet pancakes with a side of turkey sausage &  a scrambled egg. I knew ahead of time that it would be way too much food & it was... so I took home 1/2 of my pancakes & turkey sausage for later (the trick is making sure the pancakes don't get soggy,  which thankfully they did not).  Honestly,  the red velvet pancakes just tasted like regular pancakes that were dyed red...(i have run into this elsewhere too) but I did like that they were served with a little whipped cream,  fresh strawberries and a yummy cream cheese concotion. And I was very pleased that they offer turkey sausage for people like me who do not eat pork.  So, breakfast was good...not the \"best ever\" but it was good and our server was very good. We will definitely be going back as there is much to try on their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The wait can be very long, so you will want to time your arrival just right or plan to wait.  But it is well worth it.  The food never disappoints.  Very good quality and I LOVE their french toast.  You might want to share because the portion sizes are large.  Wonderful place for breakfast!  Because it is small, it can be loud."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food with pleasant and efficient service.  Reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Basically a dinner with way above average food. Their Athenian breakfast is excellent as is their spinach pie with Greek salad is at lunch. A nice touch was a thermos of hot coffee with my breakfast so I never  had an empty cup. After a meal here I am full for hours afterward. They give you value for your money. Sunday mornings is a packed house and a wait for a table but it is worth it.  Good place to take the family for any meal."}
{"text":"If you're willing to wait on busy mornings and deal with the occasional impolite and inattentive staff, it's a good place to get some quality food at decent prices. Overall, the experience is an enjoyable one!"}
{"text":"First time eating here ... Based on reviews the expectations are high !  My meal is Eggs bacon and oatmeal so it should be an easy meal !  Restaurant is crowded and it's almost 2 pm on a week day ! Apparently it's crowded a lot  which means they're  doing it right"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and lunch spot.  Super friendly and efficient staff serving a wide variety of delicious food.  My eggs came with a side of yummy oatmeal to keep my cholesterol levels in check.  Mom had the special french toast stuffed with Brie and raspberry preserves.  Awesome.  They handled our party of seven smoothly and kept us all happy.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wish I could give more stars. First time eating here. Right when we drive up we had a feeling it was going to be good. When that parking lot is full and people are waiting outside you know it's worth the wait. Had a typical wait time for Sunday morning. Great atmosphere, top notch customer service. Everyone was smiling, kind and friendly. Other restaurants need to take some notes from Stacks. Biscuits and Gravy were to die for, kids loved the pancakes, and the fresh squeezed orange juice. Even if you are not a fan of OJ you must try it. So yummy. We will be returning and are going to make it a Sunday tradition."}
{"text":"Good food. A bit pricey for what they are though. This is Waxhaw, not high rent NYC. Specials only during the work week."}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast ever! Only complaint is that there always so busy... but I guess that's a good problem to have ha"}
{"text":"If this wasn't the only place in Waxhaw to get some breakfast, I'd never go here. Terrible service and only decent food. But it'll do if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Locals breakfast spot with big portions & friendly service. Always good. Open for breakfast & lunch."}
{"text":"Great local diner, best club with fries in town. Always friendly service, moderate prices, great portion sizes, and the only true diner around."}
{"text":"I saw the mother of all french toast today at this place. WOW! The toast was like the size of a  round cake pan made slice of bread perhaps 2 inches thick. Not sure what it is called, but it really caught my eye. I had a skillet which was very good and filling. Next time I need a healthy dose of starches, I will look for the colossal french toast on the menu."}
{"text":"All I need to say is that they know what they're doing! The food is great and large portions. I have never had anything that I didn't enjoy. They order their cheesecake from Carnigie Deli in NYC, if you have never had their cheesecake do yourself a favor and do it! To add prices are very low. A must go to spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and top notch value through the week.  All Bacon is not alike... theirs is fantastic.  Eggs are a little small however.... M-F specials are awesome, not to be beat. go early for either meal to avoid waiting..."}
{"text":"Back again.  Really a good place, but get there early, especially on weekends.  Had the chicken and dumplings and they were different, but excellent.  The dumplings were wide, thin, flat noodles covered with a yellow gravy along with chunks of chicken floating around.  It was so good that I wanted to eat it all, tried hard, but just could not finish the mammoth portion, but really, really wanted to do it.  Parking is Hell.  There is private parking in front, but not enough.  Cars are abandoned all over the businesses on both sides and along the road.  And you could get boxed in by some inattentive parker.  Just no room to expand and I don't think that they want to build a multi story parking garage.  Another occasion I had a cup of bean and sausage soup.  It was outstanding and I regretted not ordering a bowl with my gargantuan breakfast.  When I checked out I told the cashier/manager about how yummy the soup was and he asked to kitchen for a takeout of the soup for me...gratis.  What a nice place and demonstration of customer satisfaction.  Fight the parking and the wait and get in there.  Worth is 100%"}
{"text":"If you're going out to breakfast/brunch/lunch, you should be going to Stacks! We love coming here and trying the specials and have our favorite go-to items, too. The stuffed french toast, the skillets and the omelets are our favorites, and for sides, the biscuits are amazing. Try the OJ as well as all the delicious, homemade desserts. The sandwiches and lunch items are also wonderful, but our experiences are mostly breakfast.   The owners go out of their way, both in person and on social, to make everyone feel like a welcomed part of the family, and we are so happy to have this gem in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"Had lunch there (Waxhaw) yesterday (8/14/2015). Food was good, but service was a little off. She never checked in to see if we needed anything and we had to flag her down when we to get some ketchup, the one on table was empty. She never brought our check so we had to go up front for them to pull it up. Will go back because food was good and it looked like everyone else (that did not have our waitress, people beside us had our waitress and looked a little disappointed also) was getting good service."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here the past 2 Sunday's and myself and the rest of the family really enjoyed it.  Its very convenient to my sisters house and we made sure to get there before the rush, which seems to be after 9.  Hostess is nice, the owners wander around helping out, our server this week was great, the week before could use some improvement.  I had a veggie egg white omelette both weeks, it comes with your choice of toast, which is fresh baked bread, so good!  I tried the hash browns one week and they were decent, but I opted out his past weekend.  We also got a short stack of the french toast to share and it was delicious, as were the pancakes (snagged a few bites from my nephew's plate), and the plain belgian waffle was also amazing.  Not so good though was the whole wheat waffle we tries this past Sunday, it tasted sour and was just not good.  My sister got the eggs benedict and that was yummy.  My dad tried a few wraps and liked them both.  They have a good looking lunch menu as well and we keep saying we need to try that out, so maybe this weekend.  Overall a great diner!"}
{"text":"Great step up greasy-spoon style breakfast joint.  We had coffee and Florentine eggs Benedict and Omelettes (huge omelettes - the boys split one) and grits and bacon.  Nice service - nice place - Great breakfast.  Happy stomach."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding from the food to the faster service since they moved to their new location!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to the new place yet but previous experience was great! Delish breakfast and fast service! Prepare to wait but it is well worth it"}
{"text":"This is some great food. Home cooked breakfast and daily specials are great! Fresh squeezed orange juice a must.  This would be 5 stars if not for the ridiculously long waits that can be encountered, especially on weekends. Usually, if we want to go on the weekend, one of use will go first to get on the lit and the others will come later, closer to the time when a table will be ready. If you are by yourself, it is usually possible to sit right down at their bar and eat right away."}
{"text":"The new location is so fresh and so much bigger! I love eating at the counter as it brings back memories of my father and I going to diners together.   You can't go wrong with any of the breakfast dishes and I especially love the challah French toast selections.  George really cares about his place, his patrons and his staff!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 5 years now with my girlfriend and this place never disappoints. It's everything a diner ought to be. Family-owned, friendly atmosphere, great service, and quality food. Try the french toast it's better than your Moms."}
{"text":"Great diner!  Home style food is great!  If you go on Sunday be ready to wait because it is packed."}
{"text":"My mom got a tip from a co-worker to try this place for breakfast, so naturally, since we're always looking for new breakfast joints to try out we happily drove there.  We went their on a Sunday morning so it was pretty crowded, of course, but we still got a table earlier than we expected.  The size of the restaurant is pretty small and not much to look at but the food makes up for it.  For a busy Sunday morning our waitress was delightful and served us promptly and our orders were warm and prepared as described.  Now I've been eating there for the past three weeks, every Sunday morning, and love going there each time and trying a different breakfast item, they have a good selection of breakfast items to choose from.  I can say I am now a fan of Stacks and will be going there for breakfast many more times to come!"}
{"text":"I will never wake up and say 'damn I need to eat at stacks today' but I would eat there again. Nothing special, service is good and food is good not great."}
{"text":"We are loyal customers of Stacks and finally had the chance to see the new location. Wow! As usual food was amazing. Staff is always friendly and get to know their customer by name. Which is a warm and welcoming feeling when you go there. We make sure we bring our out of town guest there. It is a one of a kind place. Yes they get very very busy but Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I came here after having friends talk about how good it is. Will they must be just eating breakfast because i just ordered stuffed cabbage and it was so bad i could not eat it. I told the waitress and then she brought me a Greek salad. OMG. It had so much feta cheese i could hardly see the lettuce (that all center pieces of lettuce like we through away). It had chicken that was so dry there was no way to get it to go down.   Then she brings me a bill charging me for the stuff cabbage. I tell her and then she brings me out another bill that is more. So 14.00 later i still have not had any lunch. Good thing breakfast must be good because the lunch i had and the service i had was awful."}
{"text":"I'm from NY and whenever I go to visit family I make it a point to get there at least two times... Can't wait to go to Stacks next week when I come for Christmas!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food. Taylor ham, egg, and cheese sandwiches too!  Jersey diner food without the Jersey attitude. Make sure to get fresh squeezed orange juice from their really cool orange juice machine."}
{"text":"I'd say this place was \"a find\" except for the fact it seemed pretty well-found when he got there: The parking lot was full, the tables were packed, the folks were all pretty happy. Obviously, this place is no secret.  Nothing remarkable, just good, old-fashioned country breakfast. Service was good, food was served up pretty promptly, and it was well-prepared.  It was what we wanted when we drove there from Charlotte, and it was worth the drive."}
{"text":"Jersey style diner in Waxhaw.  Their menu serves breakfast items all day, they had us at that. We've driven by the diner many times and notice it's always packed. Now that we've made it in, we know why. It was pretty full and waited 10 minutes for a table (party of 5, 2 adults 3 kids). The manager gave out mini apple muffins as we waited, nice touch!   I would say it's the best breakfast place since we've been down here. The serving sizes were more than enough and prices on par with other breakfast places. I would say it's a great casual breakfast place. We all enjoyed what we ordered, stuffed french toast, reg french toast, omelet, and apple pancakes. The french toast is made with their own fresh baked Chalah bread, thick sliced. And the orange juice is real fresh squeezed, we've been to some places where they claim it is but really doesn't taste it. For those looking for taylor ham breakfast sandwiches, yes, they have it!  We will definitely go back, for the food but also the friendly service."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times before , both breakfast and lunch and it's always busy, with friendly service. The menu is varied from soups, salads, entrees, wraps, sandwiches , varied egg dishes, omelettes, waffles , French toast, burgers, sides,comfort foods like meatloaf, stuffed cabbage, country fried steak, just to name a few. In my opinion breakfast is always the best meal here. The coffee is great and you get a pot on the table.  Today we ordered lunch to include the grilled salmon with Hollandaise, the Athena special, a skillet dish of shredded  potatoes, cubed chicken, olives, feta cheese, peppers with a fried egg on top ,plus 2 liver, bacon and onion entrees. The salmon was delicious moist and tender. I was able to sub for the mashed potatoes and ordered onion rings .  The Athena special was delicious as a one time try but flavors were to many together for my dining mate and he would not order again. The two liver dinners were a disappointment as the liver was burned and dry. We showed the waitress who apologized and the manager?  took off $3.00 off the bill.  Otherwise food was plated nicely, good portions and came out hot. The atmosphere was comfortable but could get a bit crowded and noisy at times. The dessert case had a nice selection of cakes and pastries. Basically a good restaurant that features homemade cuisine and something for everyone with reasonable prices and breakfast served all day"}
{"text":"The French toast here is amazing.. just amazing! it is delicious, just sweet enough and they have such huge portions. My husband ordered the full size and had enough for 2 breakfasts.. it's like a loaf of bread.  It is in a strop mall but hard to find; we drove right by it even with our GPS. The fresh squeezed orange juice is very good indeed and the coffee was good. We enjoyed this meal tremendously and will go back when we visit Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Great little place for a nice southern home cooked breakfast.  Everything from the orange juice to the pancakes,  eggs, grits all better than normal.  The service was exceptional,  made you feel like you were in their personal home kitchen as a guest.  Place is always crowded but somehow moves quick, not too bad of a wait."}
{"text":"YUM!  Great place for a delicious and fresh breakfast.  Was there yesterday morning with my family.  Eggs, \"homemade\" bread, coffee, shredded hash brown potatoes, and a short stack of pancakes.  Always consistent.  Always fresh and delicious.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Need to check out their new restaurant in the food lion plaza. Much bigger with more seating and room. Food is still the same, awesome!!!! Anything on the menu is worth it."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and really nice.  The food is awesome and delicious.  Every time I have dined with them, everything is great.  Thank you Stack's for great dining experience."}
{"text":"We recently tried Stack's for breakfast because of other good reviews. Needless to say we were not disappointed. We tried the pancakes, omelette, hash browns and the fresh squeezed orange juice. All very good! This place is crowded and noisy but they do move you in and out quickly. If you are looking for a good southern breakfast I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We're new in the area so we look to try new places and the first time we went was for breakfast at about 10am on the weekend....the parking lot was full and there was a mob of people waiting to be seated, we were told there was a 20-30 minute wait so we went elsewhere. 2nd time we went at 7am so we were sure to be seated but it was still very crowded (again weekend). The pancakes were like lead, very thick and not very tasty. The biscuits were so disappointing being that they were hard and cold. I had a western omelet with hashbrowns and oatmeal. The meal was good but nothing to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated to get. The restaurant is very quaint and has a look like it belongs in movies where they're depicting small towns. It was clean and the servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Tried the berry waffle and the Popeye skillet with over-medium fried eggs. It's decent, and the coffee could be better, but ask for a grilled biscuit on the side and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Waxhaw for about a year now. This is hands down the best breakfast in Waxhaw. Do yourself a favor and stop by. Yoy won't be disappointed. Get the fresh squeezed orange juice!"}
{"text":"Love Stacks.  Always get fresh breakfast or lunch here.  Diverse menu with something for everyone.  I got their marinated Pork pita and Pasta Salad, which was great!"}
{"text":"Food was really great.  Unfortunately the service was terrible.  Order came out wrong and food for the table was not served together.  When we told the server we were missing an item didn't apologize or try to rectify the situation just deducted the amount from the bill.  If you are going to be busy you need to not get flustered and maintain great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and for good reason! I typically always end up ordering breakfast foods bc it's so good. I've had pancakes, waffles, French toast, breakfast sandwich/biscuit, fresh oj, hash browns, eggs, bacon... everything I've had there has been really good."}
{"text":"The best \"diner\" in the area.  Breakfasts are good and plentiful.  The place is pretty small so plan ahead for seating.  As for lunch an dinner, the menu is pretty solid and the good quality is generally above average.  The staff is friendly and courteous.  If you are in the mood for diner food, Stacks is the place to go in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"Food delicious, the fresh squeezed juice is awesome and prices are very good same as waitress we are for sure coming back"}
{"text":"We visited Stacks this morning (Sunday) and arrived to a line out the door. We were quickly sat and did not have to wait long. Service was amazing and the food was even better. My husband ordered the Big Daddy skillet with a biscuit and I had the Western skillet with toast. The skillets were huge and delicious! Very good with easy over eggs on top to drip yolk onto the skillet. I also like the touch of giving us our own carafe of coffee so we can help ourselves.   We were very impressed and can not wait to go back to try other dishes. We unfortunately ate our food so fast that we forgot to take pictures!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Consistently great food but it does get very busy and often has a long wait!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.   Very good selection and everything was prepared properly.  Texas toast and coffee were also both very good.   Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I love Stack's. I had always heard about Stack's but had never been. I finally had a taste of it when they catered a party I was attending. Their cannolis sold me! My family and I finally went to the restaurant for lunch. It was lunch on a weekday and it was packed! I knew they get busy but I wasn't expecting a 40 minute wait during a mid-week lunch. We've been looking for a delicious breakfast restaurant/diner since we moved here two years ago and we finally found it at Stack's! The menu is vast and the service is fast and great. The cannolis are the best I've ever had and my Italian husband couldn't agree more! Despite the long wait, we will definitely be back, especially for the cannolis!"}
{"text":"Obsessed. This is def not a place to go and try to watch your cals. #treatyoself and go for the French toast and beware...a side of bacon feeds 2, possibly 3. If you're like me, though you'll just take care of it yourself. It gets busy on Sunday, but they move quick."}
{"text":"There's motto is \"Good food and lots of it\" and they deliver on that promise each and every time.  Heads up though: this place is very good and word is out so you may have to wait.  That shouldn't matter because goods things are worth waiting for.    My son and I have eaten at Stacks twice now.  He and I both LOVE breakfast food anytime and there's hardly a place better in south Charlotte / Waxhaw to find breakfast that good.  Each time, they bring him so much food that he can barely finish which is ok by me.  That usually means a full belly and a nap on the ride home.    I've had the french toast and an omelet that was nearly too big for me to finish as well.  I even grabbed a slice of cheesecake to go on my last visit.  Soooo good!  I'm definitely heading back to Stacks."}
{"text":"Great fresh squeezed OJ.  Eggs Benedict was good but not exceptional. However service was below par.  All in all an average experience."}
{"text":"The French toast is worth the 30+ minute drive it takes me to get there!  I love the option of the short stack, because a full order is enough to feed an army!!  There is usually a wait, but again, worth it.  Come hungry because you will get a lot of delicious food!  One tip, it's a little hard to find with a GPS.  It's in the Food Lion shopping center (the Waxhaw location), sort of hidden off to the right."}
{"text":"Stacks is a great local place to grab a delicious breakfast. They only serve breakfast and lunch so don't attempted for dinner but otherwise you will not be disappointed. The food is fresh, they squeeze their own orange juice and the quantity given to you is very good value. Previously they were in a pretty small building which made wait times a little long but their new location has more seating and is quite nice and clean."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! I'd come here just for the fresh squeezed orange juice!!!"}
{"text":"We go to Stacks in Waxhaw every Sunday morning. Sometimes we have a wait but that is fine since we love their breakfasts and the servers are always so friendly and efficient.  The poached eggs are perfectly cooked, as are the omelets, you can get fruit instead of potatoes with your meal  if you choose, and my husband loves their Jersey breakfast sandwich with Taylor ham, something not a lot of places carry.  They also carry bakery items that are delicious.  Doesn't get better than this !"}
{"text":"Typical breakfast diner. Nice environment and kind service. French toast was great! The orange juice was freshly squeezed and a must if your doing breakfast. The service was not the quickest but it's a good place if you want to have a longer breakfast out (approx. 30-45 minutes)"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  This run down little building may not look appetizing but the food that awaits inside is very good.  I highly recommend this place for breakfast.  The portions are huge and delicious."}
{"text":"As you guessed, great pancakes. Varieties are endless and you pick the stack size you want.   Good food but get there early, parking is spotty and sometimes difficult. Typical breakfast fair eggs, toast, hash browns, crisp bacon.    Casual atmosphere and tightly packed tables. Prices are typical for breakfast."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a '6', I would. Few places I go to are \"that good\", and I tend to be very picky, i.e., \"honest\".  We are new to the area, and wanted to try out this breakfast place (they serve lunch too). We came mid-week, and even then, we had about a 15 minute wait. I cannot imagine what it must be like on the weekend. Often times, a long wait is the fault of the kitchen for slow service or staff for clearing tables slowly. But that is NOT the case with Stacks! The long lines are because this is a local favorite and everyone wants to come here! The longer lines are unavoidable if a place is popular, and Stacks is one of those rare finds.  First impressions: busy, clean, fast. With as busy as this place was, it remained clean and no noticeable food junk on the floor. That was definitely a welcome site as many places I've been they just wipe the tables onto the floor and sweep \"when they have time.\" Tables were clean and not sticky from syrup or other food. Our server was prompt to our table and made several suggestions. Prices were very reasonable (on the inexpensive side). We had read other reviews that said to try the orange juice, so we did. Definitely freshly squeezed -- a must if you go here!! Choices on the menu range from Southern (grits, gravy, etc) to the more traditional. I chose something in-between (eggs topped over hash browns) while my spouse had their \"small\" stack of French toast, which was anything but small! Fresh THICK bread for her French toast was amazing, as was mine. A bottomless cup of coffee with the carafe at your table and we were good to go.  This is definitely a place to go and one we will frequent often. Servers are very friendly and helpful here, and all the staff was pleasant as we made our way out the door. I can't wait to come back and try something new next time! Great place!!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Great food. Always a good experience. If you haven't been here, you need to go. Go to brunch place for sure."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Sausage gravy on the side was perfect over my scrambled eggs. Can never eat all their breakfast.   My husband had the challah French toast included in the lumberjack breakfast( eggs, choice of meat, hash browns or grits or oatmeal, French toast or pancakes) and I had a bite, just the right amount of cinnamon taste, yumm!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places around!  Try the skillet eggs with hash browns it is excellent!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great services, always fresh and extremely busy so be ready to wait but it's worth every minute!  If you are missing your Tri-State Greek Diner and you love breakfast than Stack's is definitely your place!"}
{"text":"I should start by saying I like \"greasy spoon- dive breakfast joints\".  With that said, this is a great place to grab bacon and eggs in the morning.  It was clean, and the service was quick.  If you are in the area check it out."}
