{"text":"Lots of choices on tap for beers for good prices.. they also change out their selections pretty regularly. Food is iffy (the corned beef hash is the diamond in the rough) and a strange smell emanates from this place. Bartenders are pretty friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place. The beer selection is amazing with the best prices around on all bar drinks. The food has come a long way in the past few years. The service can be spotty at times but has significantly improved recently, if you are in a hurry you should definitely go up to the counter to order, but after you order the service is much better. I would recommend getting anything with the BBQ sauce here, it is amazing.  The Jolly Scholar is generally a great place to hang out for the college age crowd, and the food is great for anyone."}
{"text":"The Jolly Scholar is a fairly new establishment (2008) in the Case Western University Circle area located close to the Case Western University bookstore. Formerly named Wackadoo's, the Jolly Scholar is now independent from its former corporate reigns. 

The Scholar is packed with entertainment, from pool tables to arcade games. There is also a bar and several flat screen televisions lined up. The atmosphere is fun and food is comforting. Seems mostly like a hang out for friends. However, like many campus diners, this one is also run mostly by college kids, so you can expect average service. Overall, the Scholar is a fun place to grab some food with friends."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch during freshman orientation and ended up with an inedible hamburger... plus a very long wait. It seems a pity that folks have to linger for food this disappointing. This place is convenient and not much more."}
{"text":"Have no idea how delicious the food is. Went into 1/3 full restaurant for lunch, waited 40+ minutes for order (burger, soup, salad) and was told kitchen slammed so not sure when order would be coming out. Had to leave for an appointment. Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"It's just a college bar. Lots of beers on tap, but never anyone in here. Ok / bad food. It's relatively cheap."}
{"text":"I used to really like coming here- this is my 3rd year at Case. The food and service have been continually going down hill since my first year here. The quality of food has gotten particularly bad this past year and I finally hit my last nerve last night with this place when I got food poisoning. No more."}
{"text":"Far better than your typical college campus bar! ~20 beer taps featuring a broad range of micro-brew beers. All drafts are between $2.50 and $4.50 and most shot pours are in the same range. Food is fantastic (especially anything BBQ) and reasonably priced.  Servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"First, the bar. It's the best thing on campus. The bartenders are friendly and helpful, the beer and liquor selection is excellent, and the crowd is pretty fun, too. At the same time, the prices are reasonable.  Five stars.

Second, the food.  The new menu is very good.  I'm a fan.

Third, the table service.  Not at all good.  Over the past four years, I haven't ever been wowed by the service.  Most of the time it's just horrible.  I can usually expect to wait at least 15 minutes before being noticed by one of the waiters.  If you want to go faster, head up to the waiters' stand and ask to be served, or better yet, place an order then and there.  I've routinely experienced screwed up orders, although these seem to be happpening less frequently.

An argument could be made for four stars, but I think that the nearly uniformly bad table service tips it downward.  I'll give three stars, and keep an eye out for (hopefully) improvement."}
{"text":"The Jolly Scholar. 

I returned to the Jolly Scholar for a quick bite and I remembered why I loved it so much as an undergraduate student. The atmosphere is lively with the hustle and bustle of college students. It's the perfect place to grab a beer and indulge in bar food. I always go for the chicken tender and mozzarella sticks and I'm never disappointed. There is a slight sweetness and cinnamon taste to the chicken tenders that isn't overwhelming and the mozzarella sticks are...well, cheesy. Jolly never fails to disappoint serving well-sized portion of food. Their customer service is what you can expect from a college bar, depending on the time of day the service can be super slow or average. 

Love this place, going to miss this place when I graduate."}
{"text":"I work across the street, so I've been here a handful of times, and gotten something different every time.  Never had anything that wasn't good, but the pulled pork quesadilla is a standout for me.  It's pretty traditional American pub style food, with a decent amount of variety, and all of it delicious.  The atmosphere is fun, really plays into the whole college vibe.  The service is sometimes a little slow, but overall worth the experience.  Every time I've been there has been in lunch break from work, so I've never tried any of the beer.  Hopefully someday!

Also: always substitute for the sweet potato fries.  So good!"}
{"text":"For not being locals and knowing exactly where it was, the location was unique and a little bit hard to find. Located in one of the university buildings, the Jolly Scholar was a nice find. 

We ordered the chips with queso, salsa, and guac as a starter. It was nothing special and perhaps we should've asked the waitress for a recommendation. 

I got the BBQ pulled pork quesadilla after asking the waitress for her recommendation between two items. It was a good standard size flour tortilla and I enjoyed it overall. The BBQ sauce is rather sweet, which I personally enjoyed, but want to note it in case anyone is expecting a smoky tangy BBQ sauce. I opted for fries instead of the chips and think it was good decision. 

The hangover burger includes a bacon/chorizo hash and a sunny side egg. The burger was cooked well, the yolk was nice and runny, but there could've been more of the bacon/chorizo hash. 

Overall, The Jolly Scholar was a nice find on our trip to Cleveland. It had a friendly atmosphere, with good food, and good prices. We would recommend it to anyone looking for good bar food and drafts."}
{"text":"This place can be a bit tricky to find if it's your first visit. I went on a Sunday night, so it was relatively low-key. A couple of students were there watching
the Browns game. I had the hot wings, which were pretty good. The Guinness I had was pretty disappointing as it tasted watered down, but I had a Thirsty Dog after which was very nice. Very reasonable prices for the beer, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Jolly Scholar is a collage bar. However while sometimes the service can be a bit slow the community of people that make it one of the most friendly places to have a quick meal or drink. The food is quite tasty but the menu is a bit overwhelming. I love the wraps they have and the burgers. The bar is great and has lots of great brews and is always changing. The bartenders are great people and always willing to help you out with a hard decision on what fine liquid to pick. Overall a top notch joint!"}
{"text":"Great food and lots of it. Clearly aimed at the college crowd (me and my coworker were the oldest in there by several decades, I'd guess) but we enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"By far the most accessible bar near Case. The food is excellent and the staff are amazing. This place has really improved over the past few years and continues to surprise. The pulled pork is fantastic and the selection of beers is something that you won't find anywhere else on or near campus."}
{"text":"Decent selection of bar food. Great selection of craft beers on draft. (Although the food and drink portions seem to have gone down in the past year.)Plenty of seating. Service is efficient and very friendly. If you're coming from out of town there's a (pay) parking garage very close on East Blvd."}
{"text":"My son and I came here on a busy, late Sat afternoon. Alumni and Parent's Weekend. We sat at one end of a long high top table in the bar area to watch the NLDS game. Although the was a party of 6 at the other end of our table which received service and another large party at the long table next to us, nobody even glanced in our direction. Servers flitted around to both parties, bringing drinks, food, checking in, and nobody asked us a thing or even looked at us. After 20-25 mins, two seats opened at the bar, and one of the guys who kept coming back to the party at our table was now behind the bar and finally asked us if we wanted something.

I had a few beers, and they were solid. Nothing exceptional but very good. I brew and I know my beers, and I was happy on that front. That is the only reason for the two stars.

The food, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. I ordered wings. The menu did not indicate a side of fries, though other items in the section explicitly did. I ordered Buffalo with blue cheese. I got cold fries to my surprise and ranch dressing. One of the wings looked like it had dropped or of the basket yesterday and they figured it out for me today; it was inedible. I asked the clueless bartender for blue cheese, and he went back to the kitchen. He came back and proceeded to give me another plastic ramekin of ranch dressing. The wings themselves, all six of them including the dead one, were barely coated in sauce, but they were passable, except the dead one.

My son said his burger was merely \"okay\" and looked it.

Maybe another night, with another team working the joint and our experience would have been different. I very much wanted to like this place but left quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Anyone who is familiar with the \"so-called university\" Case Western, knows that this restaurant is the only redeeming quality in a long list of pathetic failures known as the school's students, faculty, admin, policies, and fiscal management.

I frequented the establishment while a very good-looking young chap there was making all the chicken fingers by hand for a related outlet. I understand he later went on to become very successful in life - another anomaly for the university, brought to you by Matt, the mysterious shark-tank-like genius who runs the show.

...But that was back in the days when the student body wouldn't stage massive protests about a few extra police officers staying on campus for 5 days as they were needed for a once-in-a-lifetime civic event being held nearby... in the middle of the summer when the campus was basically empty any way. Simpler times.

A rotund but amicable fellow, Mac, was bartender at that time, and was a true wizard of mixing. The Jolly can be counted on to provide excellent and innovative drink options all year round. Do recommend seasonal favorite apple pie moonshine.

Matt is also a world-champ level barbecue competitor, who travels the country and trots the globe with his merry band of southerners, doing battle with inferior culinary talents. He hangs out by the bar at times and anyone can meet with him and chat him up, which is cool and also shows he's involved in his business.

The rest of the crew is also great and service is remarkable considering the student body pool from which it draws.

On the food front, American-style bar food has transitioned from an \"also on the menu\" to \"the reason you came.\" The menu changes at least once per semester also, which adds variety. Recommend the fish and chips, pub pickles, chicken philly and regular philly, and chicken tenders. The burger menu is also impressive and all of their specialty burgers are worth a try.

It's really an asset for the school and student body."}
{"text":"How could I give them 5 stars?  A college bar, you ask?  The food is amazing and all made in-house, the brisket, the smoked meats, everything.  And on Sundays they have a great deal, all the wings you can eat for only $10, and their wings are the bomb!  Don't miss coming here if you can find it."}
{"text":"I like that this is a student run joint but there were a few things during my visit that didn't vibe but I would still stop by and try it. Unfortunately, when I arrived there was no one that welcomed me and being new here I didn't know if I could grab any table or had to wait for one. I found a waitress that cleaned off the table for me and told me she would come back with menus and never did. I waited about ten minutes and no one came to the table. I was lucky enough that seats at the bar had opened up so that I could move there instead to get service. 

The bartenders were very friendly. The falafel bites were good and I wanted to love the pretzel because the flavoring was delicious and the sauces were good but the pretzel tasted like the frozen ones you can buy at the store. The beer was good and I would come back for more of that."}
{"text":"I like the Scholar, though I miss \"Wackadoos\". I never even went there when it was called Wackadoos, but that name was just so much better.

 I wanted to give them 3 stars, and here's why: confusion. I've never been to a bar with so much confusion! Over food! It's hard to get a server to notice you if you sit down at a booth, and I'm never really sure if I should go to their little cash register kiosk and order, or just let them come to me. This is because I'm never sure what they want me to do. Are the servers coming to the tables during this hour or do they simply take the orders elsewhere at this hour? Also, if you have a tab open at the bar, order your food at the bar, because that will cause even more confusion.

Buuuut, I like so much else about this place that they retained their 4 stars.

I ultimately have enjoyed every experience I've had here. Everything is delicious (best fries ever) and the beverage selection is wonderful!"}
{"text":"LOVE Jolly Scholar! 

A hidden gem in Cleveland! They have the best chicken wings. Love chicken wings Sunday. It's all you can eat. And the drink price is reasonable and they do have quite a few beer options on the tap!! 

My favorite bar in Cleveland."}
{"text":"EDIT: I increased the rating to four because I've noticed an improvement in the service since I posted the review below.

This sports bar on the CWRU campus (it's inside Thwing on Euclid Avenue, next to Severance Hall) is a good \"hang out with friends joint\" rather than a \"date place.\" PLENTY of places to sit and lots of TVs near your table, so go there if you and some buds want to watch a game.

The beer and booze selection is pretty good (especially considering this is a campus bar), the menu is decent (find it here: http://www.thejollyscholar.com/#!__main-page ) and the tabletops are painted with the portraits of famous, mostly bright people in keeping with the place's name. 

The one downside to the place can SOMETIMES be the waitstaff. They're students and once in a great while I get the impression this is their first job ever. They TRY, they really do try, but once in a blue moon you get someone who doesn't know to come check your table every X number of minutes the way a seasoned waitress at Denny's would.

P.S. Per a recent conversation with the manager, JS will only be open until 9:00pm during summer break, probably not open at all on weekends until mid- or late-August."}
{"text":"Great Service. The chicken poblano soup and Mac and cheese bites were delicious! Free shot of Baileys on your birthday"}
{"text":"I can't call it bad service at the Jolly Scholar...  really, it's more like no service.

It's a bar run by college students. Keep in mind the implications. 

Be prepared to fight for service."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! The only CWRU eatery that doesn't just smack of Bon Appetit.

Don't expect anything fancy, but expect the bar food you order (buffalo chicken sandwich, grilled cheese and tomato soup) to be good. 

If they rename the \"devil's toenails\" sauce I'll make this five stars. I'm serious. Is that quid pro quo?"}
{"text":"Best campus bar!! It's always a good time to visit the Jolly because you know that no matter what time you stop in that you're guaranteed to get a deal!! Their drink prices are affordable for those on a college student budget and their bartenders are great!! Aside from the drinks, their food is pretty good too! I have always had great service when I come to the Jolly--kudos to the management!!"}
{"text":"Very much a college hangout. Great beer menu, but unfortunately they were \"out\" of several beers and we were there early on a Friday evening. Still, service was fast and they were accommodating to  picky order. Very good for a quick bite, especially if you do not need to park."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. It was hot and everything was fresh. Their prices were fair compared to everything lease in the area. However we ordered over the phone and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes but when we went to pick our food up our order was no where near ready. We waiting an addition 15 minutes for our food. The atmosphere of the restaurant was not my thing but it would be great for the college crowd."}
{"text":"Great food! The Buffalo wings were really good and I had the Hangover burger which was awesome! It had chorizo, hash, cheese and a fried egg. They also had a full bar there too, which I thought was different since this place was on school grounds. The service was very good and friendly."}
{"text":"Interesting place. We went here after a long day of driving to Cleveland and a very rough checkin at our hotel near the Mayo Clinic. It was VERY hard to find for us but once we were there we realized that this was almost like a college study hall type place. It had amazing food, interesting decor and friendly service. I wish I had some place like this at my college. Lol. I'd give it a shot...especially for the wings!!!!"}
{"text":"It's conveniently located on Case's campus and its nice to sit here and have a drink and some delicious bar food.

It has a sports bar type feel to it with sports running and a 24 DRAFT SELECTIONS. Happy Hour also runs from 2-7pm daily, which is nice since it lasts much longer than most typical happy hours.  

Case doesn't allow them to advertise alcohol specials other than online and doesn't allow them to sell pitchers or buckets.  They only allowed buckets on cinco de mayo.  

The food is delicious to snack on when you are delicious burger/sliders.  The fries are really good, just a little overly salty.  However, they are deliciously crunchy and flaky inside.  Try the FRENCH FRIES- hopefully they're just not too salty.  

The prices are moderate but really good when you go during happy hour.

Make sure to try Wyler's Pear Cider- it's wayyy tooo good.  It will get you drunk fast though so take your time.  and did I mention 24 DRAFT SELECTIONS ON TAP!! :D

The bartender is really nice and friendly as well! :)"}
{"text":"The Jolly Scholar is CWRU's food gem hidden near the center of a thriving campus. 

Located inside Thwing Center, the Scholar is run by a great family of folks who pride themselves on good food and hospitality. Their barbecue is award-winning, and the variety of food (wraps, pizzas, burgers, salads) is always a fresh, tasty time (may I suggest the Chicken Summer Salad, with the raspberry vinaigrette, just amazing.) In addition to great food, their bar and beer selection is quite good, with a new brew pub near to starting production on site for tasty brewed selections created right on premises! 

One small problem is parking, as the establishment has to deal with CWRU's lack of local parking spots, but ample numbers of metered spots on local adjacent streets, plus several new parking structures such as the one at Ford road, are accessible and close. 

Prices are good, and the staff is very upbeat and thoughtful. Also, of course, try the barbecue if you're so inclined, it's really worth the trip. Their barbecue sauce has won awards, and my wife loves it to dip her steak fries in:) 

So, if your hungry, and want to get your jolly's, may I suggest being a scholar of good food, and trying...THE JOLLY SCHOLAR:)"}
{"text":"Trivia is a waste of time and money. The questions are easy, the MC's are both insulting and boring, and the food is definitely subpar. I know you're on CWRU's campus, but really guys. You can do better."}
{"text":"Me: \"Do you have a beer list?\"
Female Bartender: \"Sure.\" Hands over the beer list.
Me: Reviews beer list. 20 brewed in-house beers? Hidden away on a college campus? Why have I never have heard of this? No wonder this place is so crowded!
Me: \"Do you have a sampler?\"
FB: \"Yes, you can get all 20 beers for $20.\"
Me: \"Yes please!\" hands over credit card quickly. 
FB: \"So which one do you want?\"
Me: \"The sampler- all of them.\"
FB: \"Which number beer do you want to start with?\"
Me: \"Uh, start with number one and just go down the list I guess.\"

She leaves and comes back with a tiny 1oz pour of beer #1 in a shot glass. Yes, the flight is each beer sample served one at a time. At Case Western Reserve University, the 37th best ranked college per US News & World report, this is how they decided to sell a flight of beer. 

I wander back to my companion in a daze who is sitting at a booth across from the bar. How do I explain this to her? No paddle neatly labelled and filled with a proud selection of beers. Not even the lazy baking tin delivery method. You are just expected to ask a bartender 20 times for a sip of each different beer.

Somehow, I managed a second and third trip from our table back to the busy bar, and cajoled the male bartender into getting 3 samples at once (though they had to reuse my shot glass and the other two came in little plastic cups). This was not a quick process as you can imagine, and I increasing began to feel embarrassing participating in this tedious exercise. So, after tasting about 7 or 8 their beers, we left. In the end, it cost $20 and took 25 minutes to order and drink 7-8 ounces of very average craft beer. 

Here is the part where I could make some pun about \"learning my lesson\" about beer tasting at the Scholar or how they need an education about bar service, but I'll spare you those puns. Don't let the joke be on you like it was me. Go anywhere else if you care about beer."}
{"text":"This is everything I could hope for from a college bar:

- Good, cheap beer.
- Friendly bartenders.
- Plenty of space for big groups.
- Convenient hours and location.
- Acceptable food, acceptable service.

I like beer, so having such a good set of beer options right on campus single-handedly justifies the Scholar's existence in my mind. They have a couple dozen beers on tap at any given time, ranging from PBR to delicious local craft beers (like from Thirsty Dog or, obviously, Great Lakes). The beer is pretty cheap (though not quite as cheap as it used to be - half price beer before 9PM last year felt like stealing!). Prices range from $2.50-4.50.

The food is pretty meh. Nothing on the menu particularly stands out as great (though the fries are better than anyone else's on campus). If you're not sure what to get, pick whatever option is harder to screw up.

The service can be infuriated at times. If you sit at the bar, the bartenders will usually take pretty good care of you (including getting you food pretty promptly). Many of the other servers, however, are younger students and will mess up your order or forget about you. Don't be afraid to wave at them or walk over to the kitchen and remind them, otherwise you might be sitting there all day.

Wackascholar (The Jolly Wacker?) probably doesn't actually deserve a full four stars, but the convenience of really delicious beer pushes it over the edge for me."}
{"text":"This little place is inside the student center at Case Western, but is open to the public. If you're on campus for a little bit, this is definitely worth checking out! 

They have a variety of programming and delicious foods! There are TVs on every wall and a full bar. You definitely don't find that on a college campus student center very often. 

They've been featured on TV shows on the food network and do a mean pulled pork. The WINNIN' WINGS are da bomb. They're so flipping delicious with the crazy sauce and super cheap too. You can definitely come here on a student budget and leave exhaustingly full. 

Something that I didn't realize until recently is how good the milkshakes are! Often, I just get a chocolate shake with the meal of the day (only $2 bucks!), but their specialty shakes like thin mint or nutella & peanut butter are sooooo good. I often want to get two, but then I remember that I don't have the budget for some new, larger pants. 

The waitstaff are amazingly nice. They are also amazingly talented! IF you ever go on Karaoke nights on Thursdays, you can hear them belting out country tunes and rapping like no one's business. Great entertainment and great food, there's nothing better than that! Only problem with the place is if you're not a student living on campus, getting parking is NUTS! So if there is an artic vortex, be prepared to WORK for your food."}
{"text":"We had dinner at The Jolly Scholar tonight. I had a veggie quesadilla and my husband had wings. The food was good and there is a wide range of beer choices. The restaurant is on campus at Case Western Reserve University and it's a little hard to find.  It's pretty much a typical college bar restaurant but it's always nice to try something new."}
{"text":"The Jolly Scholar is the bomb!! Conveniently located in the Case Western student center, this is a great place to grab a bite to eat or get a drank when you're on the Case campus. 
When you first walk in, seat yourself wherever and the server will come to you! There are many signs around the bar area that shows their specialty beers, so grab yourself a light refreshment while waiting to order/get your food! I love getting their apple cider, which is perfectly sweet. 
As for the food, the many times I've been here I've only ordered their wings. Why? Because they are Award Winning!!! Like literally, they are called Award Winning Wings! I usually get the 50-50, which is a combination of teriyaki sauce and something else delicious that I don't remember lol. It comes with super crunchy and yummy fries on the side and a little thing of ranch sauce, all for just $9! Thank you Jolly for not completely breaking my wallet :) 
Just a warning, service tends to be on the slow side so be patient because the food and booze are worth it!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise inside Case Western! Lovely service, interesting menu, and close to street parking makes this place an excellent choice. Do order the plantain dessert if plantains are your thing. Also, their portobello and avocado fries. Their burger with the onion rings was especially delicious. Oh, and try their different sauces."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Jolly... it's convenient for a quick drink after clinic all day or for dinner with classmates.  I especially enjoy the buffalo chicken quesadilla... it's filled to the brim with chicken, bacon, cheese, and buffalo sauce.  There's a slight kick to it which makes me love it even more!

Sometimes there is a long wait time for service or for food, but it's a college bar with college students working for the most part.  You kind of get what you'd expect.  Everyone is always super friendly though!"}
{"text":"Before writing this review, I wanted to make sure I gave this place a fair shot and by fair shot I mean coming here three times. First time I went was on trivia night, which was so fun! We ordered a pizza, it was a good size and could be shared amongst a few people, but the taste wasn't very appetizing but I thought maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. We also had an appetizer (I can't remember what we ordered at the time) but it too, was mediocre. 

Second trip, I ordered the Jolly burger, which I thought may be a step up from the pizza, and unfortunately it wasn't. I eat burgers all the time and this burger was dry and tasteless. I ordered sweet potato fries on the side and they were frozen and very unpleasant, I couldn't eat more than the fry I tasted. Also, my order was served wrong and needed to be corrected three times, but I won't include that as part of the review as I understand these are student waitresses and it is common to make mistakes. Also as an appetizer, we ordered these potato chips (they were fresh, made from potatoes) they were delicious, I loved them.

Now the third time, I thought why not come for what they seem to be known for; wings! Boy was I wrong! Third time is a charm? NOT here. The wings were the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life. The wings were not even all wings. The basket came as two (frozen) chicken tenders, 4 regular wings, and a huge drumstick. How is this an order of wings??? I didn't know whether to laugh or cry over this, it was a combination of the two because I've never seen anything like this in my life. It was really funny now that I look back.

Anyway, one star for the atmosphere, trivia night, karaoke and, other activities they have going on. The other star is for the potato chips! I would only come back for the appetizer and maybe try a dessert but I wouldn't eat an actual \"entree\" here again."}
{"text":"Food was good.  I stopped in during lunch and ordered the chicken philly.  The portions were good and the flavor was great.  The bartender was attentive and the general atmosphere was really inviting and casual.  If I went to school in Cleveland, this place would be a regular stop."}
{"text":"I came here with some classmates after class one day (which was perfect since our class is over at 5) to relax and get to know them better and it was such a great time. We didn't have anywhere to be so we didn't really notice how long we were there or anything, but I don't remember any of the five of us feeling neglected or like things were taking too long (as some of the other reviewers were saying). 

I am not normally a beer drinker as most beers, to me, taste like I've already thrown them up, and it is not a pleasant experience. Yet I asked our friendly waitress if she had any recommendations for beer for people like me and she brought me this really delicious grapefruit beer! I was so surprised that I really did enjoy it! Actually it didn't taste much like beer, but more of like a nice summer drink you would have with breakfast. I also ordered the Fish & Chips which I also really enjoyed. 

They were out of some things when my cohort were ordering, but that wasn't the waitress's fault and she was pleasant about it. 

Overall, for a pub that is right in the middle of campus, and literally down the stairs from one of my classes, we had a great time!"}
{"text":"A pretty decent college bar. I went with a very large group on a Tuesday night, and it was empty so they could seat us right away. Good selection of local beer, and a brand new menu they started earlier this week. I ordered the shrimp pita which came with cilantro creme, fresh tomatoes and onion. Everything was fresh and flavorful, and the kale salad on the side had a light dressing which was great. Food came out in a timely manner, and several of my friends were extremely happy with the grilled cheese and tomato soup they ordered."}
{"text":"It's not the greatest food ever, but it's pretty much the best on the Case Western campus.
The food is pretty edible (though I wouldn't recommend getting a salad from a place known for its meat and beer), and the personal pizzas are pretty good. The sweet potato fries are wonderful, but my friends say that the normal fries are pretty great, too. 
Food is kind of greasy at times, but it's all in all a good establishment that I'd recommend to anyone visiting Case."}
{"text":"AWESOME Bartenders!

If you want quick service sit at the bar. Its a great atmosphere with a large selection of beers.

Get the Chicken Chipotle Wrap or the Jolly Burger. 

Amazing fries (regular and sweet potato). 

During NFL Sundays.. there are great deals for.all you can eat wings and PBR."}
{"text":"Good food and not too expensive!!! Friendly and energetic employees. Plenty of TVs to watch the game."}
{"text":"Not too shabby of a place. As a graduate student, seems like a chill place to hang with friends on less hectic nights. Trivia night gets a full house. Every now and then you'll catch people studying at tables and at the bar. Unlimited wings on Sunday nights. Again, chill place."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had a Reuben and the meat was a little dry. The onion rings were perfect and crispy. My husband enjoyed his burger. Our beers were good as well. We each had a New England style IPA. Our first impression wasn't great as we were gruffly instructed to sit by the side away from the bar since a band was playing that night. I just wanted to get a look at the bar but apparently I would be in the way of the awesome music that would be playing later in the evening. I might try the place again but not likely."}
{"text":"good wings and wide selection of beer at a low price. good environment. good place for the local."}
{"text":"I write this from the West Coast, as I've been looking for another Jolly out here and gave always come up short. Simply put, the Jolly has the best craft beers on tap, for the best prices, with great food to go along with it. The bartenders are great, even if they can get bogged down on a busy night. The music and atmosphere is always on point."}
{"text":"This is a fun college bar.  Prices are good, and service was great.  My only issue was a lack of decent wine.  They only had cheap wine.  I would visit again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Jolly Scholar is the true definition of a college pub! Bar, tables, and facilities were very polished and clean. Paintings line the upper wall from the Godfather to Fredrick Douglas. Vibrant titles of the speciality brews along the bar pillars. Numerous TVs decorated every wall each playing various sports and games with audio provided by the game played at the main tv above the bar. The staff is extremely polite and personable. Slightly under staffed was not enough to provide attention to everyone on a slightly slow afternoon. My food did not take to long to come out. I had the unlimited wings for $10 i chose the gold rush wings which were the bar favorite mixed with traditional and boneless styled wings. They were tasty with a mixture of honey mustard bbq & mild. They were served with fries that were very warm crispy and salted. Overall good experience would not  mind coming back."}
{"text":"The food used to be great, but it's gotten terrible over time. They used to have waffle fries, but randomly took it off the menu. Their salads were really well made and had high quality ingredients, but now are little more than a bowl of lettuce and kale.

It's incredibly disappointing too see how poor the quality of the food has become in recent years."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection, reasonable prices, and friendly bartenders. Combined with a super fun Karaoke Night every Thursday, what more could you want from a campus bar?"}
{"text":"A few months ago, I was waiting for the release papers from University Hospitals and the lunch tray wasn't appealing so I escaped for an hour and went to The Jolly Scholar in search of real food.

Not only did I find satisfying food, but my favorite cocktail and Peter, who took care of my needs and assured me a good time. The bar/restaurant is alive with students (how do they learn full of beer?) and music.

They say they feed the minds of the smartest kids in the world and all regulars graduate with honors! That would have made me a regular years ago.

I also learned they cater at very reasonable rates.

If you're near CWRU and hungry, thirsty, tired or bored, get Jolly and stop by here."}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel on the edge of campus for a conference and was looking for a local place to grab dinner. It was Sunday evening when I arrived and the only things I saw open were the same chain places I have at home - then I stumbled into the student center and saw this place (no clear indication from the outside). I asked my server what local beers they had on tap and she shrugged and told me I could walk over there and look. Other than that bit of weirdness, she was good. Strictly pub food, but it was solid - excellent fries and pretty good buffalo chicken sandwich. Atmosphere isn't anything special, but the prices were decent. I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Was at Case Western for a conference and had some free time and went to the Jolly Scholar after it was recommended to us by the campus tour guide.  This was a great recommendation and the fact that it was in the middle of campus made it and event better location.  

The Jolly Scholar has several very knowledgeable bartenders who have been around for a few years now.  The have a great beer selection and they even brew several of their own beers in house as well.  I tried one of their in house brews and it was really tasty.  

The Jolly Scholar also has  a large menu and even though I did not order food, several of the people I was with did and it looked so good.  I was sad that Meatball subs on Tuesday is no more as I visited a few years ago and had it and loved it.  

If you are a student Go to Jolly Scholar, if you find yourself on Case's campus try to go here, you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Daaaaaammmmm in a river, this was quite the jollificating experience. I have been officially jollified by this scholarly burger. I know some people say they had a bad experience and bla bla bla.. honestly I have no idea what they're talking about. We came on a Saturday and it was kinda slow. We were tended to right away, although the kid serving us didn't know the difference between mountain dew and sprite, shame on him. 
The burger however was wonderful. The bun was soft and delicious and the party was quality beef. 
Nothing on the menu is over $9.99 Which is wonderful for a poor person like me  
I love the little hidden gem of this place. Would totally come here again."}
{"text":"Pros
-Good Food, definitely above average everything
-Friendly staff
-Nice and chill atmosphere
-Plenty of seats and TVs
-Fair price on MOST food items

Cons
-Somewhat loud music, but then again it is a college bar, so I can't really hold that against them
-Items that are overpriced, are grossly overpriced, but again, also expected considering the location and the reputation(and considering they were on food network)
-lackluster desert menu (all they offered were milkshakes at the time

Now on to the food,

BBQ wings (Boneless & Bone-out)  - good
Fries - average
Cheese pizza - good, but over priced. 9$ for garlic & cheese breadsticks basically
BBQ Burger - Good, the bun stayed soft, and the patty was of nice size and stayed juicy
Mozzarella sticks - Thick cuts of cheese, nice crust, pretty hard to mess up mozzarella sticks, however I do give them credit on their sauce, definitely more flavorful then the average. 
Stuffed Mushrooms - I'm probably going to order these everytime I come honestly, they're very good.

Pricing wasn't bad, portions weren't Large, but they weren't small either, I'd say it's a fairly priced restaurant that will give you better tasting food overall then most similar places. 

If they had more deserts, lowered some of their prices and/or added daily deals(or increased their portion size) they would get 5 stars no problem.
A burger, Garlic cheese bread sticks(pizza), 14 wings, and 2 appetizers shouldn't cost 50$ in a place this lowkey. But if that price directly reflects the quality of freshness they provide, then I honestly say it's justified. 

Will be returning and recommending

One small gripe, vegetarian options were available such as Veg-Chicken and Veggie burgers, but they ran out before I got there. Hopefully I'll get a chance to return and try them out another day, the chicken Philly seemed promising."}
{"text":"This is a college bar that is open to the public. Keep that in mind when you walk in on a Saturday and are ignored for 15 minutes straight by three different bartenders. 

Things apparently more important than serving you drinks (especially if you appear over the age of 21): 
- putting glassware away
- cutting lemons and limes
- chatting with friends
- entering tips and tabs into the computer like it's closing time

As a bartender of over 10 years in my past life (yes, even while I was in college) none of the things mentioned above are more important than making money for the bar: AKA SERVING DRINKS TO PATRONS. I would have been fired. Period. Fruit is to be cut before opening. Glassware can be cleaned and restocked by a bar back or just ONE of the three bartenders, but not during a rush. And tips/tabs are entered at the end of the night. 

I did not try the food, but the lack of service left a bad taste in my mouth. Talk about amateur hour. And being a college bar isn't an excuse. I expected way more based on the positive reviews and was beyond disappointed. 

Two stars because my tequila wasn't over-priced and was free-hand poured."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing beer selection, especially considering it's a campus bar. The food is good, and they have great bar specials. All the beers, including the microbrews, are CHEAP. It's awesome. 

The bartenders and servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered ahead to avoid waiting. The order was placed wrong and then had to wait to get the order re-placed and got cold food. At no point was our server Gloria concerned about the order. Never coming back! No discount or comp was offered for the extra 20 min wait.  All items on food should be listed so there isn't confusion. I also had to serve myself a drink from the machine."}
{"text":"Cheap prices, good beer selection, and a lot of televisions. Located in the student center at Case Western. Will go back"}
{"text":"Had the Mac n cheese burger..... it was yummy to my tummy. Super cheesy and a great blend with the burger sauce and what I think are house made pickles. I had the Carmel brownie milkshake it was just ok. Had to have it remade because the first one literally some milk that they shook up. Service was what you would expect from a young inexperienced college student. She was sweet enough but I'm glad she's gettin an education to better herself, serving is not her calling. Would definitely come back now that my expectations have been adjusted."}
{"text":"The food is great, the drinks are great, always have a good time hanging out with other students."}
{"text":"You stuck at that shitty hospital across the street? depressed?  feeling like you might need a drink - 

Hello diamond in the rough!

Walk on over where the mood is upbeat and the food is really good!

I was stuck in Lerner Tower at University Hospital for 38 days.  I probably frequented the Scholar about 8-10 times.  
Price is right, good selection of all types of different fried and freshly prepared foods.  

Potato chips with ranch are by far my fav.

Drinks are also priced well, and decent mixers (for a college bar).  

Service, ehhhh - well.. not so good. 
Sit at the bar and you'll be okay."}
{"text":"The Scholar is one of the hidden gems in the University Circle area. I say \"hidden\" because, despite being on the first floor of a building that faces Euclid Avenue, few people outside the Case community ever seem to have discovered it. They're missing out.

First, the beer: the Scholar has 24 beers on tap, including a bunch of great craft offerings. Prices are very reasonable, generally no more than $5 for a pint and often less. PBR or Yuengling can often be had for $2. There's also a reasonable bottle selection that includes more standard options like Bud Light and Heineken. Unfortunately, university rules mean no pitchers.

The Scholar has a reasonable set of liquor choices as well. Food is average but cheap and with large portions. A mix of the usual bar/pub offerings: burgers, onion rings, fish and chips, wings, nachos, and so on.

Bartenders are great, but table service is often lacking and having to get up and drag your server out of the corner is not entirely uncommon. That these are work study jobs definitely shows. The kitchen can be slow even when the place is empty, but the bartenders are usually good about chasing down your food.

Happy hour is 2-7pm. Definitely check out the drink specials on Barkudo and Facebook; there are semi-regular $1 beers or $3 for any drink offers that pop up, making the Scholar an even better deal."}
{"text":"The tuna tarter app was great. Sat at the bar and bartender was very friendly! Will be back"}
{"text":"I always love coming to the Jolly. Great drinks and drink specials, a fun atmosphere, community and college students, and a variety of food to satisfy any craving. Even a milkshake! I love reliving college here."}
{"text":"Typical college bar. Very slow service so don't go when you are in a hurry. The food is okay."}
{"text":"Wait!  How the hell have I not reviewed this place yet?!  Suprisingly good beers for a college bar.  I feel really old when I come in here but I always have fun.  I feel like Uncle Jesse when he kicks it with D.J.'s friends on Full House.  Kinda creepy but it works.  Food is good too.  Bar food but the pizza and wings were dope!  Good, honest bar food.  I have been to a GLBC tap takeover and other numerous times.  Everytime I have had a blast and the owner dude is super nice and genuinely kind.  The kids in here look barely old enough to drink and its kinda hard to find but after a few shots and a couple pints to the dome you'll be signing up for the Tri-Lambs in no time!!"}
{"text":"Drove in from NYC hungry as F at 10PM on a Sunday, staying in CWR campus, this place was open late, chicken tenders and pretzels were GOOD."}
{"text":"College bar - simple but nice food.
We showed up on their trivia night which was interesting and funny.."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the sweet potato fries! Pizzas are great too but, thin crust so mine was a little crispier than I would have like but everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a college visit tour. The place was overwhelmed and we waited a good long time. But our waiter was great to talk with, and treated us well. The owner's mother (ya gotta meet and you're just going to love Candy!) even sat with us and treated us like family. 

This is a great setting, and the food was surprisingly good. Well worth the visit if you're anywhere near the CWRU campus!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  They have great prices and the bartenders especially, Aidas, is the coolest.  Quizzo on Tuesday nights and the host super hilarious."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese burger is one of the best I ever had, if you are in the area I definitely suggest a visit to it. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Ah yes, the Jolly Scholar. Good times.

Previously known as Wackadoos (and it's still printed on your receipt), the Jolly Scholar (herein referred to as \"The Jolly\") is THE de facto university watering hole for CWRU. But, surprise surprise, the food is also delightfully good.

The Jolly is tucked away within Thwing Center, hidden away from the steady traffic of Euclid Avenue, but is often frequented by students, faculty, and visitors alike. It's open for lunch, and stays open late, with food and drink offerings all day long (with the exception of a limited menu appearing after midnight on weekends).

The menu is varied, but not too cluttered with various burgers, quesadillas, sandwiches, and salads. The menu boasts certain \"award winning\" options such as the BBQ brisket sandwich and chicken wings, but I think that the falafel bites, hangover burger, and Monterrey quesadilla are the shining stars of what the kitchen has to offer. Honestly, it's hard to make a bad choice.

Whether you find yourself at a table, or at the bar, there is a continuously revolving offering of beers, ciders, and meads on tap. It's rare to find such a diverse selection in University Circle, but The Jolly makes sure to vary what kegs are coming in. At any given moment, there has to be at least 20 different brews available, alongside the permanent selection of liquors. That's amazing.

There are times when the service is spotty, especially when prospective students visit and SLAM the restaurant with demand. I tend to avoid the place entirely whenever that happens. Hiring students as servers, in tandem with periodically heavy university courseloads, can sometimes result in having your table abandoned, which can be incredibly frustrating to resolve. But that only happens once in a blue moon.

Also, there are events during the weekday evenings, and well, some of them are great, and some aren't. If you become a regular, you will slowly understand what this means.

Definitely a campus gem. If you have a meal voucher (or a credit card, like a normal person), use it here, and grab a pint."}
{"text":"My husband called this spot \"a hidden gem\" when I got him there, and I'd have to agree with his assessment. Wish I had a place like this when I was in college. It's a winning combination of solid pub food, quaffable brews, and reasonable prices, all in a laid-back atmosphere. Their burgers really stand out, and I've had both the beef and the veggie options. The veggie burger includes beets for a twist on the standard grain patty, and it's quite flavorful. I'm in love with their sweet potato fries, but their standard ones are excellent too. Oh yeah, and they're producing their beers right on site, so it doesn't get any fresher."}
{"text":"If this was my college bar...I would have stayed in school for 10 years and been a doctor, attorney and engineer.  The place has the bones of a college hangout...a bit weird and unique and unlike a place anybody could have envisioned.  It just seems like it all evolved over time, but cool.

The bar staff was excellent and they had a surprising amount of taps, but the most interesting part was that the bartenders knew a lot about beer and good beer.  As a homebrewer, I will often put the bartender to the test and the two times I have been to this place they have passed the sniff test.

The prices are insane!!!!  Again...I wish they would have had this place at my college.  

Finally, the food, which again is completely prepared by students as my understanding is students operate all aspects (less some management positions) was really good.  I had a monterrey quesadilla on day 1 and a pulled pork sandwich on day 2 and they both were great and portions were proper.

This place is hidden on campus and I found out about it in line at Chipotle from a customer in front of me that was disgruntled.  A hidden gem between Severance Hall and Church of the Covenant.  This is my new go to for lunch in University Circle...good job Case Western...I am sure the students love this place."}
{"text":"This place is tucked into the Case Western campus, so it's no surprise that I was thoroughly confused as a few alums shuttled me here via buildings and side streets. 

Happy Hour specials are amazing! 50%-off, I believe. They had a delicious seasonal bear from Great Lakes Brewery.

The fries are amazing. AMAZING. Chicken fingers weren't bad either. $6 for the combo on a Thursday (daily special). 
 
Pros: CHEAP! Good!
Cons: No pitchers."}
{"text":"What a cool campus bar with some surprisingly kickass food. First impressions were that I liked the high ceilings, the bar looked nice, large brewing apparatus in glass cases that you could take a look at while eating, and there's a cool selection of black and white paintings inside. Our waiter, Conor, was attentive and pleasant. And lucky for us, we were actually there on their first day of a brand new menu. 

I got their home made mini corndogs which were almost a meal themselves, their seedy, flavorful house made mustard for dipping was killer. And, because I am just a woman in search of the best reuben on earth, I couldn't say no to their house made brisket reuben. Oh lawd it did not disappoint. The meat was so tender and flavorful, the sour kraut and the heavily seeded mustard complimented it perfectly. 

My mom got their potato skins and the crab rangoon flatbread pizza which she raved about. And my boyfriend got the mozz sticks and their 50/50 wings. Their milkshakes were pretty damn perfect as well. Glad we got to swing by here while on our visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Drink here. 
Do not talk.
Do not eat.
And for the love of god, DO NOT be in a hurry. 

ol' Jolly will always give you a great selection of beers.

The music, no matter the genre, will always blast away any conversation you'd hoped for. 

The bar food will proudly out-bar all other bar food you know.  Most food items are pre-packaged and reheated (not made in-house).  Expect it to be cold and heavily salted.  (Except for sugar bowl that holds your sweet potato fries - WTF?)  The \"falafel\" is a basket of PGA golf balls painted brown. 

Your server, no matter the hour, will never come. 

Save yourself the trouble: belly-up to the bar and settle - quiet, hungry, and ignored - into your beer."}
{"text":"I am a waitress at a brewery in Missouri and I was disappointed with Jolly Scholar. The beer was mediocre and the waitress was inattentive and lacked basic customer service skills. The food was good, but was nothing special. I did, however enjoy the music playlist. But I do NOT recommend going out of your way for this place."}
{"text":"This place basically rules. I go here almost everyday. Great beer selection. Great food ... and quick. Try the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich. Or for vegetarians the Greek quesadilla or wrap with feta and veggies. Trivia night on Tuesdays is a blast. The bartenders are super friendly and skilled. Shamrocks on your guinness and the whole nine. This is an unassuming place that's a little hard to find (in the Thwing Center at CWRU but open to the general public) but when you do come here it's not long before you're family!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  An unfortunate introduction to the campus for my prospective student. Unacceptable wait and terrible food.

They looked busy when we walked in at 11:30, but there were only two people at the long tables by the bar and we managed to easily snag a booth. When we needed a few more minutes to decide on what to get, our waitress disappeared for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the place really filled up. 

The table next to us turned over twice and we still didn't have our food. People at the long tables who came in way after us were finished and gone, yet still no food. When I finally asked the waitress to check our food, she made the mistake of replying with severe attitude. I was made to feel at fault for bothering her when it was so busy. An older woman stopped by at the table and said our food would be there in 2 minutes. She said that they hadn't had any notice that it was a prospective student day. I pointed out just how long we had been there - over an hour - and that plenty of other people had been served in that time.

At last the food came and it was crap. My cheeseburger was a thin, dried out patty with two slices of cheese melted on, a slice of barely ripe tomato, and some shredded lettuce. It was tasteless and didn't have any of thy garlic promised by the menu. The fries were decent. We were offered a free milkshake in compensation (it was 3° outside, so hardly an appealing prospect). The older woman stopped by to be happy that we'd gotten our food and asked how we liked it. She wasn't very happy when I told her it certainly hadn't been worth the wait.

We got there at 11:30. Our kitchen ticket was time stamped at 12:08. Food arrived at the table at 12:58.

And note to the waitress - if you're working for tips, don't piss off the customer or blow them off. I'd have given you a big tip because it was busy and I know how hard that can be, but your attitude earned you the very measly tip I left."}
{"text":"Having been a student at CWRU many years ago, I was astonished to come back for a visit and find the student union at Thwing outfitted with a bar where the Pizza Hut used to be.   

This is a great addition to the Case campus, as they have a ton of great beers on tap for great prices, as well as generic pub fare for late night munchies etc.   Also, it's all-ages, which makes it good for campus parties and get togethers.   

Made me (almost) want to go back to school."}
{"text":"This place is so popular it has become a major selling point for the University. I recommend it to anyone, in particular students because the atmosphere is more aimed to them but honestly anyone who likes good food and cheap drinks would love it.

All of their BBQ dishes are amazing. They recently changed their chicken tenders' recipe and they are better than before. Most of their milkshakes are amazing (I for whatever reason didn't care for the Nutella one but to each their own). Their drink deals are the cheapest in the city that I am aware of. As others have said, it can get crowded and VERY loud, but it's a college bar :). The staff is also very chill."}
{"text":"Service was not great. Staff we met today was very rude. It was kind of taking risk going to this place that you will get bad service 50-75% of the time. I am not a college student, but the staff's behavior made me wonder about what they do routinely. College students should be treated by staff here more respectfully, and this place should have been a good model for them in the community."}
{"text":"The Jolly has the absolute WORST service I've ever had in my life. I've been many times, and I'd say about 90% of the time I have terrible service.  One of the bartenders is very rude, but more importantly, some of the servers seem to have never waited a table in their life AND have no common sense.

The most recent time I went, our waiter forgot our entire order and had us repeat it. Then we had to remind him to bring our drinks (margaritas, which were on special that day and tasted pretty gross, and varied in alcoholic strength from drink to drink at our table). Then, when he brought out the pizza two of us were splitting, he didn't bring plates--after waiting and waiting and trying to get his attention, he finally brings us two paper plates (I'm fairly sure the Jolly has at LEAST plastic plates, but not a big deal).  Finally, we order dessert--chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  About 20 minutes goes by, and we see no dessert. Then, he finally comes out--but with a chocolate shake. Definitely NOT what we ordered. Still, more waiting, and our cake finally comes. At least he brought extra ice cream to make up for his mistakes. However, I felt this was hardly compensation for the incredible lack of service.

On the plus side, the food is delicious and cheap--and it's right on campus. These are the only reasons I come back.

Be warned, and know what you're getting into if you dine here."}
{"text":"Right on campus! Love the fries, so so good!!! Burgers are good and wing nights on Sunday are the best!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed about the slow service. I have been here multiple times over the years, and I enjoy getting the unlimited wings (I believe it's not listed on menu, only available Sunday's), except the service is usually soooo slow. We were here for 2 hours once and only ordered 3 rounds of wings, because it took unbelievably long for them to take the order/cook the food. I've had burgers, wings, grilled cheese, fries, beers, cocktails, etc here, it's a good college bar to go to. The food is mostly good, obviously nothing amazing, but price isn't bad and it's convenient."}
{"text":"Awesome college bar!

Centrally located inside CWRU's Thwing Center, Jolly is an affordable option for students to grab a quick lunch between classes or grab a drink after the day is done. Usually on an average day, the place is not too busy and you can grab a booth or a seat at the bar but it does get a little busier on weekends! 

In terms of the food, they have some interesting burger options to choose from including mac and cheese and hickory BBQ. Other options are mostly just bar food like wings and fries, but you can also get pizza and a salad. The pizza is thin-crust style and pretty tasty. A vairety of different gourmet milkshakes are available and these can be made to order.

In terms of drink selection, they have maybe 20 craft beers to choose from at any given time and you can see the current menu on Untappd. They also brew their own beer and have 3 or 4 styles to choose from currently. Their porter is not bad! 

Jolly also has weekly event night including karaoke and trivia. Parking and finding the place can be a little tricky, but the best bet is to park on East and walk across Freiberger Field into Thwing Center. 

Dress code is obviously casual and you can score a meal for under $10 and a beer for $3 to $4."}
{"text":"Very nice bar! Great beer list and great prices. I don't believe any beer was more than $5 and they were all quality. They also have a good menu with many options! I will be going back. Only reason I give 4 stars is because it is hard to find. You have to go through the FedEx office building to get to it."}
{"text":"I decided to give The Jolly Scholar another chance.  I'm glad that I did.  This time around the customer service was on point.  The wait time was very short.  The staff were very friendly.  I got the brisket sandwich, which overall was very good.  I just wish that my bread was toasted more than what it was, because by the time I was able to get to it (10 minutes later, this was a to go order) the condensation from the food made the bread a little bit soggy, but for me, that nothing that would make or break this review.  Overall, very good experience."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, and I'm not a student (nor any other connection to the school) but I just remembered the place: I had a great veggie burger. (Vegan I think.) The teriyaki burger with pineapple. They have a bunch of other variations with interesting toppings and flavors--all the burgers can be veggie patties at no extra cost. I want to go back and try more! Some places would charge a lot for \"gourmet\" burgers like these, but here they're cheap, and come with good fries. I also see they have veggie \"chicken\" for a buck on other sandwiches--I want to try that with their Reuben.

Hard to judge the place beyond the food itself: I went during a semester break, so it was nice and quiet. Service was slow, but they probably had reduced staff so I forgive that."}
{"text":"So parking is difficult, but very worth it.    This is perfect from the beginning visuals of funky art and portraits to the food served.   Y husband and I have been talking about trying this for awhile and had time today.  I got a hangover burger which was a very good burger.   The pickles may be made in house (they are sweet) and the bread is excellent.    My husband got a flatbread where he ate the whole thing.    We did have a bit of a wait, but it was worth it in the end.   The beer was good.   Yelp had a coupon to try when checking in.    Definitely a good place to try!    They also do take out which seems to be very popular."}
{"text":"I am 32 years old. In October, Insha'Allah, I will reach 33. I am 33% older than many of the patrons of this bar. 33 is a Master Number in Numerology. Jesus performed 33 miracles and died at age 33 in 33 AD. Rolling Rock bottles display \"33\". There are 33 Degrees of Masonry. There are countless instances of 33 and it is considered to be a divine number. I counted 33 attractive college girls on my first visit to The Jolly Scholar. Modern mysticism is at work on the campus of CWRU. I discovered Shangri-La."}
{"text":"Good food, good drink, friendly staff and a neat setting. Me and coworkers go here frequently for food and drink either at lunch or after work. The food is good, I normally go for the wings and fries which are tasty.  They have a nice selection of beer, many of which are home brewed. They have a full bar and they make good strong cocktails. I do have to take a star off because sometimes the service is slow. It can be challenging at times to get the bartender or servers attention if you want to get a refill or place an order."}
{"text":"The Verdict: Great affordable place for students to hang out for lunch or after a long day.

The Food: For a bar, they have surprisingly great food! My favorites are the Southwest Chipotle Ranch Wrap and Monterrey quesadilla. The wrap is just a wonderful mix of chicken, bacon, cheddar, egg, avocado, and corn! (I ask for no tomatoes and onions) They have a unique spin on their sweet potato fries, it's sprinkled with sugar and I quite like it that way! I've also gotten wings here (They have all you can eat boneless wings + fries on Sunday for $10!) and they were decently good. They have a variety of sauces and flavors you'll want to try out! I like gold rush and 50/50. 

The Extras: Jolly Scholar is inside a building called \"Thwing Hall\" of Case Western Reserve University. They are located on the right side of the building and have several entrances. You can walk into Thwing Hall itself and then find your way to Jolly Scholar or there's a side entrance on the right side where you'll also find outdoor seating. You don't have to be affiliated with Case Western to dine there. 

I took a star off b/c while they do have great food and beer, I had a bad experience with service once or twice (but I know that is not representative of the overall establishment!) Once at a group table, our waitress was down-right horrible. I came late and she saw me sit down and then proceeded to not give me a menu or even ask if I was dining. REALLY?! In the end I had to flag down ANOTHER waiter for a menu and order. But then this new waiter told the original waitress and then through some miscommunication my order was NOT PUT THROUGH. It was after a long wait and lonnggg after everyone else got their food did I ask them where my order was and they're like WOOPS. And don't worry it gets better. One of our friends did not like the nachos she got and wanted to send it back. She tried telling the waitress this but instead the waitress feigned confusion and took the nachos. The waitress then proceeded to ask if anyone else in the table wanted the nachos instead. After multiple answers of silence, one of our friends said \"Oh I'll take it I guess\". When we got our checks, the order of nachos was now charged on the girl who took the nachos! WHAT?! But you know what was the worst? It was this girl's BIRTHDAY dinner! Also, we got separate checks but the waitress was so lazy she just gave it to one person at the table and left it to that person to give the checks out. And she did the same again when giving our credit cards back. So...you're making our own friend a waiter too? I get that these are students but this is a legitimate job and there is professionalism in service. 

Other than the complaints I have about their service, I really do like Jolly Scholar. I think it's fantastic that there's a bar right in a college building and they really do their best to cater to students.They have special deals each day so it's best to check their website (It changes all the time!). As of writing this, their website says:
SUN: All you can eat boneless wings + fries for $10 (If the waiter/waitress doesn't tell you about it, you can just ask them and they'll confirm it)
MON: Football + Brewing
TUES: Trivia Night @7PM
WEDS: Margaritas for $3 
THURS: Grad/Senior Happy Hour @ 5PM, Karaoke @ 9PM
FRID: Forties beer for $5
SAT: Jolly Beer Release Party (YEA, THAT'S RIGHT, they make their own beer too!) + Donation night @ 9

As you can tell by now, their vibe is very much \"Hang out and have fun\" There are students that hang there since they can also use their meal plan. They also do take-out so I usually call ahead to put my order in."}
