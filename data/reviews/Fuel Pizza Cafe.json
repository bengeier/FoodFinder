{"text":"This pizza is by far the best and only real New York Pizza. They have a wide variety of food for a pizza place. BUT I ordered some pizza to be delivered. As usual gave them my name, phone number and adress. I waited an hour and 30 minutes and called them. They said I gave them a fake adress and telephone number and they didn't even deliver to my area. Not impressed with the delivering service"}
{"text":"One star for HORRIBLE Customer SERVICE 5 stars for delicious pizza......Ordered delivery of just a large cheese pizza and 3 garlic knots because the min. delivery was $15.....Ordered online at 915 pm, said it wasn't going to be delivered till 1030...So I waited.....The clock turns 10, the manager calls me and tells me her delivery driver went home early and asked if I could come and pick it up....and she would give me 10% off my order.....Grrrr.. So I went..Got there and I asked if they could take the THREE garlic knots off the order because I just ordered them to make it over $15...It took her 15 minutes to take them off the order....And on top of that when I got home I looked at my receipt and NO 10% off! Anyway......Not ONE apology or thanks from the manager! Everything about this situation is wrong."}
{"text":"I realize this is primarily a pizza restaurant, however I must comment on the Cobb salad. Most of the salad was iceberg lettuce. Sprinkle a few tomatoes on top and call it a salad? No thank you. There are plenty of other food establishments that understand mixed salad greens and vegetables."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to get a quick late night snack so we decided to stroll into this fuel pizza. As with any restaurant we should of turned around and walked out when we first noticed that the place was empty. We decided to stay and try this pizza that we have been told multiple times \"Best In Charlotte\". I ordered a 12\" (Medium) price: $13.45 (I might be a few cents off) and a toasted sandwich. I have never in my whole life been this disappointed in a pizza. Cheese was sparse, Sauce tasted like Prego, and worst of all smaller that a $5 Hot and Ready at Little Caesars. The toasted sandwich was I believe $7.00 and it was the size of a Subway 6\". I do not mind paying for quality but when you are walking out of a restaurant you shouldn't feel like this company just got the best of you. I will never return and I will encourage anyone not to step a foot in the establishment."}
{"text":"I want to commend the manager for adressing a little problem we had last night with an order we called in.He handled the problem professionally and resolved the issue . Very good PR!!!"}
{"text":"Was originally going to eat at Chopt but the people I was with were too hungry to think a salad was going to fill them up. So we walked over to Fuel Pizza. BIG MISTAKE. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and ended up paying $12 for the worst sandwich I had ever eaten in my life (plus a drink.) The bread was dry, the chicken was also dry and tastless, there was barely a smear of buffalo sauce, barely any bleu cheese. When they took they tray out I almost wanted to be like \"are you serious?.\" STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Charlotte is obsessed with Fuel Pizza, and I have yet to figure out why.    The first time I ate there, we picked up our order and took it home. I had an Asian salad which was mostly tasteless iceberg lettuce with a delicious asian dressing. Unfortunately, they don't offer this dressing anymore, so that's a big strike against them.  I also had 2 garlic knots, which were alright, but I was expecting them to be a little more moist (read buttery).    The second time, we ate at the restaurant, and I ordered a piece of veggie pizza and a salad. The salad was once again disappointing, so that's the last time I will ever order a salad.  The pizza slice was large, and I ate most of it, but I much prefer Papa John's or even a homemade pizza (where it doesn't look like it was sitting out for a while).    The atmosphere at this location is nice.  I could definitely be comfortable watching a game or two there, especially upstairs, which is where we ate."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for dine in and they accidentally put it on de delivery rack. After 45 minutes of waiting and asking where the pizza was the manager told me it will be free next time. I tried to order the pizza again and the manager was no longer working. The New management did not believe me and did not give me my free pizza."}
{"text":"We walked in and everyone who worked there just kind of stared at us like we were bothering them. We ordered our food and sat outside. I got my salad first, which obviously didn't take long since their salads are already pre-made and refrigerated with the meat already inside. GROSS. My husbands sandwich on the other hand was obviously forgotten about and once it came out we realized it was made wrong but at that point we weren't really surprised. We went to throw our food away and the garbage can was over flowing with trash. This was my first and last time here. There are many other places in Rivergate that are WAY better."}
{"text":"I suggest you not even go to this restaurant.  We ordered , waited 40 minutes, and they said they never got our order.  They returned our money  but never apologized!!  They found our ticket laying on the counter, not processed!  Customer service was terrible in that there were no apologies or compensations!!"}
{"text":"I used to love Fuel and have been going there for years, but I'd say in the last year or so, things have gone downhill in both customer service and taste of the pizza. Today I ordered the Combo #1, 2 cheese slices with garlic knots, came to almost 10 bucks with tax. The receipt says 2 Specialty slices. I said to the guy I didn't get Specialty slices - just plain cheese. He says to me \"Every slice is a Specialty slice\". Believe me, it wasn't so special - plus by the time I finished the first slice, the second one was ice cold. If you want oregano like I usually do, you have to go up to the counter and ask for it. At other places I've been to, it's right there on the table along with the salt and pepper.(My table only had pepper). If you want great NY-style pizza, head over to 500 Degrees Pizza (formerly New York Pizza) on South Blvd and Archdale. Owner is from up north and knows how to make an excellent pie. Slices are big, too. Might be a while before I visit Fuel again."}
{"text":"i normally have a great experience here. We have been ordering here several years. I called in today to place a pickup order, was told there would be a 30-40 min wait which was fine. But then Danny placed me on hold and didnt pick back up. So i called right back only to be told i could go somewhere else if i like. Thought that was very rude so i asked for a manager. She then stated she was the manager and they had new workers and was very backed up. Stating she should have told me this the first time. Never met this person but everyone else is normally very pleasant. And i really wanted this pizza tonight"}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza (at best) that tastes like it's been sitting under lamps for hours.  Arrived lukewarm and crust was tough. Not worth the calories!!  Might be willing to overlook the less than average pizza if it weren't for the rude, dismissive wait staff.  Service at all stages was slow and unfriendly. When my 10 year old went to the front counter to get a cookie for dessert (with $10 bill in hand), he rudely told her \"Can't get to you right now...we're a little busy as you can see!\"  Ironically we were one of only two families in the restaurant.   This place used to be a great, family friendly place to go for a quick slice--don't know what has happened to them but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband works in this area & I visit him once a week for lunch & he suggested we try Fuel Pizza this week.  We each ordered one slice of pizza & two beverages.  The cashier suggested we just order the two pizza combo then & pay for an extra drink.  It was so refreshing that she went out of her way to help save us money. The pizza was pretty good as well. :)  This will now be our weekly location!  Thank you Fuel Pizza for looking out for your customers!"}
{"text":"Ordered online. One gluten free the only reason I eat here, and two large. Only made one and I had to wait like I didn't want to do."}
{"text":"Refuse to eat at this location due to an experience this winter. Called ahead during snowstorm and asked what time they were open/serving. Got there 30 minutes before I was told they quit serving. Manager said they were too busy and refused to take our order even after I told him I called in. If that's the way the general manager thinks business should be handled, I'll let my wallet put $$ in a different pizza places register."}
{"text":"It ain't Shakeys but this ain't CA Kids dig the dough, the pie was enjoyed by all and they do have beer."}
{"text":"Save your time and money-- this place is awful!  Last night they 'forgot' to make our pizzas! We had waited about 40 minutes or so then asked about it-- the staff was just hanging out eating at the bar area. The 'manager' I guess offered no apologies, ask if we wanted garlic knots. No thanks!  Should be zero stars. Not sure why this place is still open. This was my 2nd bad experience in 2 visits."}
{"text":"These guys definitely use MSG or MSG-like ingredients in their wing sauce. Didn't taste too bad, but I felt pretty poopy after eating them."}
{"text":"I was the only customer. I placed my order and sat at a table.  I told them it was my first time.  I wasn't given directions to the drinks, plastic ware etc.  Two guys came in after me.  They got served before me.  I had to get up, look for an employee in the back, and ask for paper plate for my pizza.  No apologies.  There were three employees and just me.  Service sucked and I told them.  The guy just shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I'm here by myself.\"  Will never go again even though pizza was not bad.  Too many pizzeria's to deal with this level of service."}
{"text":"You know, I kinda like Fuel.  This is the only location I have visited, but we have had good luck with the staff and have found the place to be clean and nice.  I guess you have to realize where you are.  It is a fast casual place, not a sit down pizzeria.  Likewise, you have to adjust your expectations.   I have been twice now and both times I ordered a veggie calzone which they allowed me to customize with the veggies I want.  Just the right amount of ricotta - most places use too much - and tasty crust.    The pizza is so-so.  Kind of reminds me of the cut rate pizzas we would get in college.  Not bad, hot, filling - but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to this location but my last experience with them was the icing on the cake.  First, it took TWO hours to get our pizzas and after calling THREE times to see what the hold up was they finally offered us 25% off (which never showed on my credit card statement by the way).  I was satisfied at the time because I just wanted it to get there already.    Second, the pizzas finally arrive and are cold and the middle wasn't even cooked all the way through.    Third, I call the following week and the new GM tells me to wait it out on the 25% refund,  it will show, it never did.  She says to come into the restaurant if I want to get it resolved.  Who has time for that?!    At this point I just want to spread the word that you shouldn't waste your time ordering from Fuel in Park Road Shopping Center.  I won't waste my time getting my $48 back but I will waste my time writing this review to save others the hassle of a bad experience."}
{"text":"A new location for this Pizza chain that's spreading like Starbucks all over Charlotte, where pepperoni's used to be in Park Road Shopping Center. Great pizza, thin crust with a delicious tomato sauce, not too big, thick or greasy, perfect and left me hungry for more.  Pepperoni was really good, and their wings are great, but if you like them hot maybe go for a level or two above the hot rating, cause they were a little mild in my book, but tasty none the less.  a great place to grab dinner for two to go and veg out by the tube gnawing on wings and chomping on pizza....brew in hand...which reminds me they also have a couple beers for sale here to."}
{"text":"Just moved to Steele creek and was excited to have a fuel pizza so close. Every time I have ordered from here that pizza takes at least 30 minutes. And this is for a pick up. They are always out of garlic knots, and my order (the boxed) is always covered in random sauces. I guess I'll be looking for a new pizza place..... :("}
{"text":"Restaurant was not busy I ordered my slice of pepperoni and my drink stood there for 10 minutes before the kid behind the counter asked me did I want something and which I told him yeah I got a slice of pizza and he went and put the slice in the oven.......didn't even apologize for me having to wait....wow"}
{"text":"I like Fuel's pizza, however they have lost our business.  We wanted to get one of their meal deals (pizza and garlic knots), and asked for two slices of pizza with everything on it.  They said we could not get that as they were not making specialty pizzas today, so we could only choose from the five they had out.    Why they can't have customer service and give people the type of pizza on their menu is beyond me.  They could have easily taken the cheese pizza and added toppings to that.  We left and forever said goodbye to Fuel.  Customer service goes a long way, and when you don't have it, we will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I used to go here for a slice or two mainly due to its convenience as opposed to the freshness of the pizza on hand. However I won't be returning to any Fuel due to a recent bad experience at Park Road.   When my 10 year old went to the front counter to get a cookie for dessert (with $10 bill in hand), the counter person rudely told her \"Can't get to you right now...we're a little busy as you can see!\"  Ironically we were one of only two families in the restaurant.   This place used to be a great, family friendly place to go for a quick fresh slice--don't know what has happened to them."}
{"text":"We ordered the boneless wings, Asian Chilli flavor. Two orders of 8 and we were given 6 and 5. How hard is it to count the amount of wings u give someone?? Is it because we ordered the food to go? The bag was given to us, tied in a knot. I guess they were hoping we wouldn't check it. Plus the fries were cold. The pizza looked days old in the case. Even though the people were nice, the food was not appetizing. I think more effort should be made to ensure orders are correct, especially when there is no one else in the restaurant. We will never return to this location. Been to other locations and they were much better!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, good price, and great locations? They always have good lunch combos. I bring my guys there for lunch all the time and never had any complaints. My wife and I haven't used there delivery service but pick up time to time for a quick dinner. One thing I will say is every time I've been in there during dinner hours the phones are ringing off the hooks and all the employees are working there butts off."}
{"text":"This was our first and last time going to this location. The pizza was good, but the service not so much. The lady taking orders acted like she was annoyed to be there. She gave us the wrong cups and when we corrected her on the size cups she gave us she slammed the other cups on the counter. Also, the place needs a deep cleaning. The floor was extremely sticky and the booth seats are all tore up."}
{"text":"Great pizza by the slice.  The knots are tasty and fresh.  I haven't tried any of the specialty type pizzas, but the pepperoni keeps me happy :)"}
{"text":"When you order a cheese pizza you expect to be able to discern the cheese from the sauce. Not so with or last order. Pizza is barely at the level of the average frozen pie. Customers service was confused and distracted. No customer focus. Tried to order online and just got an error message that they couldn't communicate to the store. Called and on hold for a while. When I went to pick up the order the store was not busy. This just dropped to the bottom of the list which is a she for what used to be a great place."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! Closets version of New York pizza I can get in Charlotte. The employees are always kind and friendly and have no problem accommodating changes in orders. I frequent this place on my lunch break because they are about 7 mins from where I work. Always clean and inviting the only thing I would work on is the sweet tea. It can be watered down at times."}
{"text":"How do you mess up an online order - its printed out for you.  We ordered a pizza and wings online - forty minutes later they call to tell us the sauces we wanted wouldn't be possible as you only get one sauce.  I explained we thought they would be on the side as the website charged us for each (four in all).  After speaking to them we agreed to just toss the wings in one of the sauces and substitute extra celery/blue cheese for the sauces.  Another 50 minutes go by and I called to see what the delay was.  Apparently the driver was on their way.  A total of an hour and forty minutes later the order arrives.  Wings had NO sauce on them or on the side.  Pizza was warm but dried up - too bad because their sauce seemed like it could have had potential.  I didn't bother calling back as I couldn't wait another hour and forty minutes for a repaired order.   Pitiful."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this location much better than the one on Central. The pizza wasn't anything special. I'm having a hard time replacing my all time fav Fellini's (ATL) here in CLT :-("}
{"text":"I've been eating pizza in South Charlotte since the mid 80's, my credentials are legit.  Every kids birthday and post soccer game win or loose was spent somewhere running with pizza in hand and playing Contra.  Now 34,  I left Fuel Pizza on Tuesday evening feeling bamboozled since they had the Showbiz pizza, but no arcade.  If you've ever stumbled into Fuel downtown and murdered a slice or two, its amazing.  Thin large cut slices, fresh ingredients, friends, its late night, your starving, fatty foods......awesome.  Fast forward to Tuesday 6pm sober and its thick small cheeseless slices that are overpriced.  I give the Park Rd location a shot every year or two, and both the take out delivery just continue to fail.  I don't know if this is B crew on staff, or where Fuel trains noobs, but the pizza is always bogus.  I got a $20 large that looked like a $10 medium, the inner diameter of 6 inches was without cheese, and the first bite of every slice was just sauce.  It was a bastard pie too, not thin, not thick, almost a Pizza Hut hand tossed step child.  The ingredients, they stand out and are very good.  The thin cut sausage is on point, the veggies are sliced right, large, but no too heavy chunks that just fall off or don't cook.  The sauce, is good.  In the end, its not a win for the Fuel Team, its a fail.  I've loved Fuel at various times throughout my life, hence why its sad to see this location blow so hard.  With so many options competing close by, NY Pizza, Portofino's, Wolfman, Brix, Mellow Mushroom, and the delivery boys, you cant serve overpriced subpar slices in this part of town.  Best of luck boys, see you next year......or 3 am on random night soon."}
{"text":"I called Friday afternoon around 2 to ask if they did pizza by the slice. As the answer was yes, I ordered two meat lover's slices (sorry, I'm sure that's not the name there, but my phone was almost dead so I didn't look up the menu) and asked to have black olives added. The person on the phone asked if I wanted olives on both slices and I said yes. They gave me an ETA of 15 minutes, which I thought was pretty long for slices, but what do I know.   When I arrived, I got in line behind one other person. When it was my turn, I gave the guy my name, he told me it would be over $9 (Jesus, I should have just ordered a whole pizza!), I paid and he handed me my pizza box. I sat down and opened it, getting ready to add some hot peppers and then head home. I was immediately hit with the smell of kalamata olives, which I can't stand. I stood back at the counter and after a few minutes, an employee came to ask what I needed. I told her I had ordered black olives, to which she replied, \"We don't have black olives.\" Wow. Okay, well, I told her that was never conveyed to me when I ordered and to please remake my pizza without the olives. She wasn't happy, but she did it. After about ten minutes, she came and handed me my very expensive slices.   I got home, opened my box, and there were two pieces...one was dried out, brown and steaming hot. The other was much prettier, but ice cold. After the brown piece had cooled enough to eat, I took a bite and immediately threw it away because it wasn't edible. After being under the broiler a few minutes, the other piece was delicious.   I was not only disappointed, I was angry. No apology was ever given for their neglecting to tell me they don't carry black olives, nor for the extra time l had to spend there for them to half-ass \"correct\" the issue. I work in the service industry, and I would have not only made clear to someone ordering that we don't offer that particular product, but I would have definitely apologized profusely and asked a manager if I could at least give a discount. None of that was done.   I REALLY wanted to love this place, as it's super close to my house and near my place of work, but I won't be going back. It's really too bad...that damn second piece of pizza was so good!"}
{"text":"With respect to Charlotte pizzerias, Fuel is as good as you'll find.  The crust is substantial, as opposed to typical New-York-style pizza joints that seem to make their crust from the same stuff they do their boxes.  The sauce is smooth, so if you want tomato chunks, order them as toppings.  Meats are great and flavorful, and most importantly, it's hard to get them to grease it up, no matter what you put on it.  No dabbing or pouring oil, and no soggy, droopy slices.    Wings are flavorful and large, as are the calzones.  I can't speak to the salads, because I don't go to pizza places for rabbit food.  Finally, service is phenomenal and friendly, regardless of whether they're turning tables or if you're there at an oddball time.  Atmosphere is mellow, and prices are very reasonable, particularly for quick, by-the-slice lunches.  They also participate in AmEx's small business perks through FourSquare.  Until a quality Chicago-style shop comes to town, Fuel is my first and second choice in town."}
{"text":"Placed an online order at 10:35 for delivery at noon. at 12:35 still no food have talked to them twice and they keep saying it's on the way. once at 12:04 and then again at 12:20"}
{"text":"My family and I use to stop in and eat here often.... Was a great place for Birthday parties and large family gatherings etc... The staff is not friendly and the food is sub par at best. We decided to never go back when we had a very rude manager, Mike, confront us about a b-day party that was planned but they \"forgot\" to put on the books for Saturday night. It was not so much the words but the actions from him that we decided we were not welcome! We did not even stay and finish. Terrible 8 year old bday ever experience. Just weird and very rude/ignorant....... Never in my life experienced such bad service and rudeness from a restaurant. Left and my wife and I have never been back since."}
{"text":"This is for this location's delivery service and food. I like variety in pizza and Fuel is a good choice. Their website could be a bit more user friendly, but after orienting yourself it gets the job done.   I like that they offer wheat crust (many of the other pizza delivery places don't have this available). The delivery service is pretty fast and the drivers are friendly.   Place an order and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love pizza, in fact, Im a self-proclaimed pizza extraordinaire. I can sniff out a great pizza a hundred miles away.  Im particular of crusts, texture, toppings and amount of sauce on a pizza.   I will never let a pizza eating opportunity slip by, so when I got a 'buy one get one free' slice coupon in the mail, I dropped by after work to get my fill.  Now Ive eaten at Fuel 3 times before, so its not the first time.  The other times were pretty good, but today was kinda weird.  The service was great though: quick, friendly and very efficient.  The pizza (one cheese slice and one spinach/ricotta) did not fare so well though.  It was hot but seemed a little too limp and thin.  The cheese layer seemed to crust, so when I bit into it, the entire layer just slipped off :(  I ate the rest of that slice with just a crust and sauce on it.  The other one (spinach/ricotta) had no spinach that I could see.  It had some sad, bland slices of tomato and a little slather of ricotta cheese.  The oregano flavor was a little overwhelming.......but I enjoyed this one much better than the other.  I give 3 stars because this was the first time I was unhappy with fuel, and also the girls behind the counter were very friendly and fast.    Hope my next trip will be better.    p.s:  Hey fuel, send me more coupons ;-D"}
{"text":"This location has gone down hill!  Not a very clean place.  Went for lunch on Sunday. Rugs in front of register had not been vacuumed in days.  Booth was sticky and seats were very uncomfortable.  Women's bathroom was poorly maintained.  Pizza was ok. But their neglect of restaurant made me second guess the quality of everything.  I will not go back to that location."}
{"text":"I wish I had looked at the Yelp reviews prior to walking in though...but I've had Fuel pizza before and I've always enjoyed their pizza prior to this visit.  Haven't had it in a long time, was in the area, so we decided to stop here for lunch. We ordered slices of pepperoni and pepperoni and sausage.   Since they didn't have slices of pepperoni & sausage ready, the lady took a slice of cheese pizza and added pepperoni and sausage to it with her bare hands...yuck!  The pizza was not good, I almost chipped a tooth trying to gnaw on an extremely hard crust.  The restaurant is dirty too with a sanitation score of 90.5 (didn't notice this until after we paid and were waiting for our pizza).  Moral of the story- go elsewhere for good pizza"}
{"text":"I love the options at Fuel, whole wheat crust, etc. I love the creative toppings and everything tastes great. Service is good as well. My only complaint is the prices are bit high!"}
{"text":"Ya know... I really liked this little place as an overall experience - the word \"joint\" came to mind.  Look for the big red building at Park Road Shopping Center and have a seat for a slice and some knots.    Arriving before the real lunch crowds, around 11:45, I walked through the door having never been there before and I am sure I had the look of... what do I do, how do I order, have you seen my mommy?  I made eye contact with a nice gentleman behind the counter and said \"I've never been here before, help\", and he said he would make it as painless as possible (that's what he said).  And he did.  I pretty much already knew what I wanted from looking at the menu on the web before I went, so I ordered the B special, I believe, which was 2 slices of cheese pizza, 3 garlic knots and a fountain drink - grand total with tax was $8.10 - good deal!  The place is decorated kind of like an old auto repair shop - old metal signs and the staff were in shirts along the same repair guy lines.  Both gentlemen that spoke to me (my order and the guy that brought the garlic knots) were friendly and helpful.  I placed my order at the counter and was given my pizza and cup for my drink, and a number to place on my table for the knots that were to follow.  The pizza (2 slices of cheese):  Pretty darn good.  Not the best I have ever had, but far from the worst.  The crust was slightly thicker than thin (but not by much), with a nice stiffness to it, a thin layer of well flavored sauce and a healthy amount of cheese that was hot without being the molten hot that peels the top layer of skin off of the roof of your mouth (cheese gets me every stinkin' time!).  A little grease on top, but not in puddles.   The garlic knots (3):  Good, not fantastic.  Slight garlic flavor, they were served super fresh, straight out of the oven with a small cup of cold marinara that was surprisingly tasty.   I left absolutely stuffed and struggled to eat the last bit of pizza - that is a lot of food.  It was a nice change of pace and I will definitely return.  (wasn't this a Godfather's pizza many, many years ago?)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, slice of pizza was re-warmed from previous day. Side salad had brown lettuce and very boring. The atmosphere was nothing special. I will not return."}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER.  I've been a loyal customer for 7 years until tonight.  I was given a 1.5 hour delivery time.  No problem.  15 minutes past the delivery time they called to see if I still want the order.  I said yes and confirmed that the pizza was on the way..they said yes.  20 minutes later and still no pizza.  I called and the pizza was still in the restaurant.  25 minutes later it arrived covered in halapenos.  No where on the menu was halapenos included in the ingredients for the taco pizza.  I asked for the manager (Mike) and he was a total jerk.  He told me they would come back to my house to retrieve the pizza and refund my money.  There was no apology.  He was sarcastic and didn't care about my loyalty or return business.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.  I've never been treated this way by a restaurant.  I'm shocked.  I will take my business elsewhere going forward."}
{"text":"I've said this in other reviews, Charlotte really isn't known for their 'outstanding pizza', and that's OK! I think as far as being local and being tasty, Fuel is on point and a solid choice for even the most critical of pizza snobs.  Located in Charlotte's very first open air strip mall, this Fuel's exterior decor tastefully matches the rest of the center. Parking is a bit tight most days, your best bet is to park in the shopping center's lot and walk across traffic at the crosswalk.  Price is great, they have a combo that gets you 2 slices, 2 garlic knots, and a drink for under $10. They're not baby slices either, you shouldn't leave hungry.  Today I got the Grandma slice with Pepperoni, and a Spinach, Ricotta, & Tomato slice. Both were delicious, perfectly seasoned sauces and great quality toppings. I kinda wish the Grandma slice had a bit more sauce, as it normally is the star of the slice at most places. Fortunately I got an extra side of sauce just to taste it on its own. The sauce is a bit chunky with herbs and cheese blended in, which translates to a fresh, homemade mouth feel, great job on the sauce.   Garlic knots were good, but not great. Grease was under control unlike some places that just slather them with butter, but I couldn't find l any garlic (minced, sliced, or otherwise) anywhere. I took the second knot apart to see if it any was hiding and none was found. I'm assuming the butter was either simmered with garlic, or they use a spice mix or flavoring. I think actual pieces of garlic would set these apart big time.  All in all, a great choice for the price. Fast and friendly service, with delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurantsI have ever ordered from or been too. I gave them a few chances but each time was as bad as the last. The delivery is the worst part of it. I would say that 8 out of 10 times they would get my order wrong or show up way past the quoted time. The other issue is that their employees act like it is your fault that they messed up an order. I wouldn't order from here or go there if it was the only restaurant open in town."}
{"text":"I'm impressed with this Pizza - Mozzeralla, Provolone blend, just enough provolone to make it enhanced - The Service was Excellent!  In the past I have been unimpressed with this place... Yesterday they were ON!!!"}
{"text":"Fuel is just a solid spot for good 'za.  It's more pricey than Domino's and Papa John's and the like, but you can taste the difference. The ingredients are better, there are more options, and it's a better overall experience.  You can dine in, carry out, or even get delivery.  The website allows for placing a delivery or pickup order online which is super convenient and easy.    Fuel is a Charlotte original and it has succeeded and grown for a reason!  It's good!"}
{"text":"I am a Fuel fan. But in the past year the experience and quality has gone downhill. Your best bet now is to order take out, and finish cooking in your own oven at home. No matter how many times the staff runs it thru the oven it never gets done. I've mentioned this to the staff before and they have said that the ovens are old and no longer heat like they used too. Had same experience and conversation with Fuel staff at another location with the same response.   What's up with this Fuel? I really want your business to succeed and flourish but the food quality has went downhill. So much that my last visit my wife ordered a chicken calzone and the outside crust was done but the middle was cold.   So, we will continue to order ours to go and finish cooking at home.   And this will probably become more noticeable as MOD Pizza just moved into the same shopping center and are always crazy busy. Maybe other patrons have seen the same. Sad."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and they didn't tell me a delivery time. So we patiently waited an hour and a half and finally called because well, we were hungry. I spoke with the same lady that took my order and she apologized for the delay but said it was on the way. So I request a discount as any decent pizza place would have offered when they we're late and the customer calls to see where their order is. When I spoke with the manager he was rude first of all and then he tried to lie to me by saying the phone worker was about to tell me they were running hour 15, but I'd hung up before she could. So I politely told him that was not true she gave me the total again and ended the call on her end. So I asked for a discount again as this was disrespectful and completely unprofessional and he obliged and then he hung up on me. We will not be ordering from fuel again to say the least due to the unprofessional management staff.    The driver arrived and informed us they only have one driver tonight... First NFL Sunday of the season?!? Maybe your management staff should go back for more customer service training on how to be polite to customers."}
{"text":"WOW, WOW and WOW. 0 Fs given by the manager/ owner short haired older woman. Since when do you spend a $100 for 2 pizzas, 30 wings and 3 side salads and get such attitude. They messed up on one of my pizzas and I was watching them and they mediated the mistake by just adding the toppings after the pizza had been cooked and passed it right on through the conveyer belt as if they couldn't be bothered with making the pizza the right way and then instead of apologizing for the half ass service and product she blames the cook and says he's new, I called her out and said she wasn't and she could NOT care less. So disappointing since this was my 3rd visit here because it had been such great food and decent service. She is very monotone and seems unhappy to be there. Food is the only reason I even rated them a 2 star. Now I'll have to either drive to the further location or put up with giving my money to someone who gives no shits to service and production satisfaction!"}
{"text":"Fuel Pizza gets four stars from me because their pizza is decent (as far as Charlotte pizza goes...) but their customer service is outstanding. I recently hosted a birthday party for my twins here. 25 six year olds. You wish you were there, I know.   My twins love pizza. Sadly, my daughter has celiac disease so she rarely gets to enjoy pizza when she is out and about or at a classmate's birthday party. Fuel Pizza offers kids' birthday parties - upstairs in the loft - and gluten free pizza - the perfect combination.  If you have tried to plan a b-day party in this area you might be astounded at the cost per child. Bowling? 20 bucks or so per child... Monkey Joe's? Don't even ask. Fuel Pizza? About 5 buckaroos per kid. You can't beat it. The best part ... the children are not at your house. Priceless.   Fuel pizza parties are very inexpensive and very hands-off. They will give the kids a tour of the kitchen, put them in the walk-in, show them the gigantic mixers and describe the ingredients in the pizza. After the tour, the kids will actually get to make their own pizzas - our waitress brought up one large pizza for every 4 kids and they were able to put on sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. My daughter's table got their own special gluten free pizza with separate ladles and spoons to avoid cross-contamination. I was impressed.   If you plan to have a party here, I recommend you bring some type of craft or activity to do with the kids or you will certainly have chaos while the pizza is cooking and cooling. We decorated aprons with fabric markers for the kids to take home as their \"thanks-for-coming-take-home.\" We were also able to bring our own cake and the kitchen brought us a knife to cut it. I really can't recommend this venue enough! A great alternative to the high-spending birthday party madness."}
{"text":"I almost broke my jaw while trying to chew through a slice of pizza here. $13 for a medium pizza that would be small anywhere else. Bland pies, even with the addition of garlic (which looked like the minced stuff you can get in tub size at costco). Rubber-esque dough.   Never again."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location but certainly not our first Fuel Pizza visit. We had a decent sized group meeting for a late night meal with friends. We were greeted by the staff as we walked in welcoming us which is always a nice feeling!! You can't beat Fuel Pizzas' pizza being from the north east we know what good pizza is!!! We were NOT disappointed in our meal nor were our out of state friends who had never experienced Fuel. Everyone deserves a meal of pizza and beer every now and then, you can get that and more at Fuel!! If you are looking for great pizza I say give Fuel a try, I believe they deliver within a certain distance. If the Park Rd location isn't your area just do a quick search as there are several locations in the city."}
{"text":"The food is ok, some items looked old in the display. My main problem is the cleanliness or lack of...the tables, the fountain drink area, the dust on napkin dispensers, etc."}
{"text":"Very bad.....This was our first experience with this restaurant.  We ordered delivery tonight and got a salad with all brown lettuce.  I called and they refunded my order; however, the lady I spoke to never apologized and just took me through the routine as if this happens all the time. Unacceptable..."}
{"text":"Fuel pizza may not offer the best pizza overall but I do feel like they offer the better Americanized version of pizza. The super pepperoni, or whatever is my favorite. My only bad experience was when I ordered a Margarita, I opened the box and it looked like someone made the pizza then dumped a whole basil plant on it. The park road location is my favorite because its so big, never feel cramped like I do with the Central location."}
{"text":"Long term customers may notice a drop in the quality of ingredients in the pizza. Even my kids remarked \"No flavor and  weird crust and taste\".  Wings still decent."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be in a position where a restaurant would intentionally serve me a faulty product, but after my experience (and enhanced documented conversations with some staff) I am pretty sure it happened last night.  We were having some drinks at an amazing establishment next door, but decided that we needed something more than wine and cheese to close out the evening.  Personally, I love a good pizza so that was the plan of action we agreed upon; And, at 10:05PM pizza is the one constant in the universe.   I pulled up my good ole Yelp to discover that Fuel Pizza was maybe a 100 feet from where I was sitting.  They had 2-stars but the last real review was nearly a year earlier so I figured we needed to give them a shot; regardless, they were opened 'til 11PM, so it was a no brainer.  My wife looked up their menu online and and showed me the options. Wow! They have it all. I rarely get impressed with pizza (being half Italian and all), but when I saw their Chicken Taco Pizza, the part of me who grew up in South Texas almost had a stroke: Amo los tacos!  We placed the order via their nifty online ordering system. It went through at 10:10PM.  Thinking it would take a bit to make the delectable taco pie, we took our time finishing our beverages before trekking over to pick it up just after 10:40PM.    My first impression when I walked in the door was how deserted the restaurant felt. A single couple was off to my left. The counter was abandoned, but eventually a team member saw me looking dazed and confused and efforted to help; she asked me if I needed anything: Her questions were more quizzical than helpful, but I responded in kind that I was there for a pizza order I had placed online. She seemed a bit less stressed at my response and turned to whom must've been her superviser for some relief.   A very nice young lady strolled over to the warming oven located just off to the side of the register and proceeded to remove our 12\" pie which she placed on the counter in front of me.  She made sure to tell me how awesome this pizza was, and after a few moments of akward silence, we thanked them and headed out the door.   The drive from Fuel to my house is less than 4-minutes.   It was probably less than 6-minutes later that I was biting down on what should have been Chicken Taco heaven...but it was not to be.  In as much time as it took my brain to process that food was in my mouth, I was coughing so violently I thought I was having an allergic reaction.  No, you did not read that wrong. I coughed so hard I thought my lungs were going to explode. My wife took a bite too. Her nibble was small enough to not cause the violent spasms I had experienced, but the intense heat was so bad she had to spit it out.  I chewed ice for a few minutes and finally regained my compusure.  Why had this happened?  I eat habanero  salsa on my hot dogs for God's sake, so I'm rarely frazzled by a little heat.  This wasn't just heat, it was was beyond tolerable.  In point of fact, this was intolerable cruelty.  What's worse is I knew that if I had reacted that badly upfront, the next morning would be the Apocalypse.   I called the store just after 11PM and was surprised that the phone was picked up.  I regurgitated the aforementioned story and asked for a manager.  The gentleman who answered told me the manager wasn't avaliable but acknowledged that they had adapted my pizza per the managers orders; apparently the sauce that is supposed to be used wasn't available so my entire sauce was jalapeño pepper based or similar. Como? How's that? I have call record so I was shocked to hear the explanation. I asked for the manager again, but she was apparently gone for the evening.   My anger slowly transformed into disappointment and ultimately fear.  I was disappointed that a perfect day was ruined: not because of choices I had made but because of choices someone else had made for me.  My fear was because I knew that come morning  my stomach would violently react to this taco slapdown that Fuel had inflicted. And, as expected, my stomach did not fail to remind me that actions have consequences.  It took me out to woodshed and gave me a come to Jesus talk of epic proportions!  At this point I'm not sure how I feel about my \"experience.\"  I'm beyond not happy. I feel used.  How many other folks receive this kind of treatment? I wonder.    I headed back to Fuel the next morning and brought my barely eaten pizza of doom with me.  It was just after 1130AM when I walked in.  There was one family eating and 3 team members preparing.  I brought my pie to the counter and after meeting the supervisor, I told her my tale and asked for a refund.  She did offer to make me a new pizza but I declined and opted for the refund in cash.  It's a hard call.  I bet they have a good product if done properly. Their reinvigorated customer service wasn't all that bad, but the whole experience left a firey taste in my mouth and lower extremities."}
{"text":"Incompetent and confused staff makes for a terrible experience. You will most certainly wait three times as long for your food as they promise you and it will taste like Chef Boyardee cooked it. Save yourself the trouble and money...eat anywhere else in this shopping center. It sucks"}
{"text":"This used to be our one pizza place. Sorry to say this location has gone downhill fast. We have tried ordering a few times over past few months and sad is not even the close to describe them. The excuse I hear is we are short staffed , for 2 months now.  The last time we tried to order for delivery it took 2 hours. I do not live that far but that is why I pay the delivery charge. The online ordering must be on windows Vista because it seems to be down a lot. Tonight we tried online and guess what ...down again. I tired to call but was out on hold and disconnected 4 times. I finally got through and placed my order only to find out the price was more than I have ever paid before (we always order the same thing sad I know) I questioned the price increase. The response was Sir you know the delivery charge, damn I didn't know I was ordering from Sullivan's . I feel so bad this location used to be great , they have a great product yet the management/staff don't seem to care ."}
{"text":"If you're a pizza and calzone lover DO NOT go here. The portion size to price is horrible. The calzones are a quarter of the size they should be and the pizza is over priced by the slice. I went here once with my coworkers when I was in town and I'll never go here again. I travel for work often and have been to some rip off places but this by far is the worst. The calzones are about the size of an iPhone6."}
{"text":"Excellent buffalo wings, hot and crispy. Taste like they're from Buffalo! As for pizza, I only ordered pepperoni but the crust, sauce & cheese were good-this is the best New York pizza I've had in a long time. I'm originally from New York and living in California a long time, I never got any good pizza! They forgot to bring the blue cheese dressing and celery, but no one at the table wanted it anyway. Family friendly place. Tv playing the football game, music was a little too loud though."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of their pizza, but the Chicken Parmesan Calzone is delicious, and their service is excellent!"}
{"text":"First time I've been to - or even noticed - this location, where Godfather's used to be in the Park Road Shopping Center (yes, Godfather's was there prior to Pepperoni's).  The Fuel Pizza makeover is pretty well complete, with the standard old-style gas station signs, even some pumps out front.  But inside, it's about normal: half a dozen pre-made pizzas, waiting for you to choose which one you want, which they will then reheat (as previously mentioned).  Fuel Pizza isn't great, isn't bad, and it will do in a pinch.  One nice thing is that around the holidays, they do a create-your-own dough ornament for kids.  Kinda neat."}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering Fuel while partaking of some libations at the Red Clay Ciderworks. They have menus inside and Fuel delivers to Red Clay no problem. Warning: Their extra large pizza is ginormous! So if you are ordering it, make sure you are able to take home leftovers. I ordered to XL pizzas for 8 people and we still took home 3/4 a pizza.   I would definitely recommend getting a specialty pizza. Every single one I have tried has been scrumptious. If you anything with pepperoni, beware that is greasy, great!, but greasy.   I have not tried anything other than the pizzas but they have always hit the spot and the delivery time has always been rather quick. The prices are on point with similar pizzerias. I have seen orders of the pasta and they look marvelous. I will definitely have to try that soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in with family from out of town for the 'voted best in town'?  The food was old, we waited for fresh, it was really just old reheated to look like new.  The place was empty and the Carolina Panthers were playing....we were the only people there. Bathroom was disgusting...went over to Blackhawk to use theirs."}
{"text":"I had visited Charlotte a couple of months ago and read about Fuel in a tourist magazine. I ran out of time on that trip and didn't get to stop in then, but when I came back to the city last weekend, I figured it was finally time to see what all the fuss was about.   The setting is nice and has a theme to go along with the name. It will remind you of an old time gas station, (though not a dirty one). There's plenty of seating inside and even a patio out front.   I went with a slice of cheese pizza and a garden salad. The pizza was great! I As for the garden salad, it was good, too, but I thought they could have gone easy on the cheese.   All in all, great place to stop into to fuel up at."}
{"text":"We come here from work because we like the pizza but the service is terrible. We just stood at the counter and four people looked right at us including the manager and never acknowledged us. We finally had to press for service. Also the combo prices are confusing and when we asked for clarification no one had a reasonable answer."}
{"text":"Fuel was awesome! They were really busy when we got there but it was mostly with to-go orders. The staff was great at handling it all. We got a half dozen knots and the extreme meats pizza. I think the knots were my favorite part. Our medium pizza was more than enough food and we went home with half our pizza. I had been to a few of the Fuel locations in downtown Charlotte and was excited to come to this one. It's also in a super cute shopping center. I would totally come back here!"}
{"text":"Idk what it is but i am just not crazy about fuel pizza period. I've tried their pizza at several different locations not just this one and it's always left me less than impressed. I also feel like they're overpriced for the lack of quality and taste. I'd much rather go across the way to Luigi's pizza to get some better tasting pizza."}
{"text":"We went there the other day and the service was terrible. We waited in line for 15 minutes and didn't even make it to the front of the line. And, there were people who had been waiting for over 40 minutes to get their pizza. We finally said forget it. TERRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"On September 24th around 5:00pm I ordered a calzone from Fule Pizza on Park Road through the Postmates app. Under the topping selection I selected Daiya \"cheese\" (I have a dairy allergy) and I also was able to add note to the order to specify only vegan \"cheese\"/sauce. Long story short, I ate a few bites and noticed there was regular cheese in my calzone. I  called the store and said they put what I was told is a cheese ball in the middle of all of their calzones. They made a big deal to tell me that they put the daiya in with the cheese ball, like I just requested vegan \"cheese\" as an extra topping. The menu says nothing about about there being a dairy cheese ball as the base. I asked for my meal to be replaced, I was placed on hold for over 20 minutes, called back no answer. I emailed corporate, no response. I reached out on FB, they told me my email was forwarded to management, no response. FB Messaged again, I was given an email for Doug in management, again no response. Messaged FB 3 more times asking for help, you guessed it... no response. I hate leaving bad reviews, but I also hate paying for a meal that was made incorrectly & made me sick."}
{"text":"Average pizza, neither NY thin crust nor Chicago deep dish, they have a decent $5 lunch special. I chose the \"A\" which is one of the \"specialty\" slices, one cheese slice and one garlic knot. Good flavor and consistency. The \"Hawaiian\" had the right amount of pineapple and ham; the plain cheese was garlicky and had some oregano in the sauce. It wasn't great, but it was better than the usual fast food offerings from Wendy's and McD's nearby.  They do delivery - I saw one of their people taking a red bag out to his car.  Would I come here again? Maybe."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and as expected, the selection that is already prepared and ready for warming during the off hours is limited. But it's off hours - is it really appropriate for a $3.50 slice or plain cheese?  Wifi was not working when I stopped in. TVs were tuned to sports."}
{"text":"We were in need of some \"fuel\" after a taxing afternoon shopping with our weirdly energetic bulldog pup. My belly was grumbling like a bear waking up from hibernation and my fellow human pals, while also hungry, weren't in the mood to drive around. Fuel Pizza Cafe was a short walk from Petsmart. We noticed the outdoor patio and decided to take a chance to see if they allowed dogs on the premise. I went inside to inquire and guess what? They do!  I didn't experience any problems with customer service like many reviews have mentioned. There was a birthday party taking place at the time of our visit, but we never felt overlooked or neglected by the staff. The cashier that rang up our order was pleasant, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time, and they even provided BamBam Lebowski with a bowl of water which we greatly appreciated. We ordered a super large extreme pepperoni pizza and while the pizza was good, it was nothing spectacular. It was large enough to feed the four of us and we were plenty full by the last slice.  Fuel Pizza Cafe is something to consider if you're in the RiverGate Shopping Center and happen to have your four legged companion with you."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but the service it terrible on so many levels. I would rather drive out of my way to another location than give this location any business. Rude must be part of their hiring process, as I have encountered many rude employees at this location including the manager."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO STARS I would. Customer service is horrible here at the Park Road location. I ordered a pizza and a salad online and waited the 30 min I was given to pick it up. I arrived and they said they were out of lettuce so they were unable to put in my order. No pizza. No salad. No nothing. I went ahead and put in my order AGAIN and was given a 15 wait time.... 35 min goes by and still no pizza. What's worse is there wasn't anyone dining in the restaurant. No urgency and no apology. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I used to come here for lunch a lot but being that's quite a drive from Arrowood rd, my trips are less frequent.  Love the decor of the place with all the old gas station memorabilia.    They have combos here of things like 2 slices and a drink, or add a salad, a sandwich.  I've only had the pizza.  The pizza is decent but they only get 3 stars because of the conveyor belt pizza oven.  The art of the old pizza oven with the door seems to be dead."}
{"text":"Just left this Fuel pizza and won't be back. I doubt they care though. I've been to this location 3 times in the past few months and have had customer service issues twice. The first time was that they forgot to serve our order and they apologized after half an hour and said someone didn't put the order slip in the right spot. Annoying but no big deal in the end, it just took a long time. The next time we went, service was fast and easy. Today though was not good. We ordered 4 slices of pepperoni and 6 garlic knots. After about 20 minutes, a girl comes over with one slice of pepperoni and 3 knots, says our wings will be ready soon. We tell her she must have the wrong table because we didn't order wings. She looks majorly confused, stares at our receipt and then says hold on, leaves the partial order and goes back up front. We watch as she yanks down all the order slips, reading them and then finally brings us back 3 more knots, explaining our other 3 slices of pepperoni will be right out. Okay. So we wait. And we wait some more. I go ahead and eat the one slice so it doesn't get cold and  give up on the idea of us eating together on our lunch date. After I've eaten, my husband is still waiting. Another employee brings over slices of pepperoni to the family that just sat at the table next to us. He sees our empty tray and asks if we would like him to take it. We say no, we'd really just like the rest of our order. We've now waited over 40 minutes. He looks surprised that we are waiting for pepperoni still and says he will check on it.  We watch as he goes up and asks the girl about the remainder of our order, she looks up at us and looks annoyed. Slaps  the pizza on a tray and brings it to us. No apology for the wait. No apology that they served my food half an hour before my husbands food. Nothing. Just here you go. I go to get a box for the rest of my order as I'm just annoyed and want to leave and he girl has the audacity to say that our order was slow to come out because the oven was broken. Huh. That's funny, cause the people next to us who came in a half hour behind us got pepperoni slices in under 10 minutes before we got ours. I tell her that it was just disappointing that we waited so long and couldn't even eat together because they served 1/3 of our order and then the rest of it 30 minutes later. Her response? An \"I could care less\" smirk and a shoulder shrug. Don't lie to me . Just say we screwed up, I'm so sorry and leave it  at that.  The pizza here is decent but I will never go back simply for the attitude of the girl who \"helped\" us today."}
