{"text":"First visit here. Distance is far compared to where I would normally dine on a Monday night, but well worth it to catch up with a close friend.   My friend suggested this place because the sushi is good/decent. I definitely can say I have had much better. I do admit the price for the sushi was very satisfying, which made the meal more enjoyable. Apparently 1/2 off sushi night every Monday and Tuesday.   I ordered 4 rolls (6 pieces each). - Alaska Roll  - Canton Roll - Fried Oyster Roll - Spicy Tuna Roll  The presentation was nice, but I think that the ingredients took away from the actual taste of the fish. When I imagine my spicy tuna roll, I think of a restaurant I went to in Seattle. The tuna was infused with spice and wrapped sufficiently with rice, but was not overwhelming with the tuna. Here at Tomo the tuna was lost in crunch crisps? and rice. I felt the same way with my salmon in my Alaska roll. The fried oyster was not bad, but I think it would be more flavorful if it was a larger piece.   I did enjoy my sushi with a side of spicy mayonnaise, which was something I have never tried. The girls at my table recommended it. Apparently it's free when you ask for a small dish, while dining in, but $1 if you request it for take out.   Overall not a bad experience. I would prob only want to come here for 1/2 off sushi night. On a regular night, I'm not sure if its worth the drive."}
{"text":"After over an hour of waiting for our sushi while dealing with an inattentive waitress,  bland rolls were consumed."}
{"text":"Another lifetime ban.  This came to us as such a disappointment.  We love trying new places and giving them a shot. This place needs to be shut down.  We stood at the hostess stand for a good 20 minutes. The girl was just confused and not making any sense about what it is she was doing. Finally we're seated in a fairly crowded restaurant and wait at least another 10 minutes to be addressed. Waited forever for the food, which was basically tasteless.  We came for a last meal, as I was having my wisdom teeth pulled in the morning and this experience was devastating to my stomach! We will never give this place another chance. A quick dinner turned into a 3 hour tasteless experience. The only reason we waited it out, like I said we love to try new places and give them a shot. Well they ruined theirs."}
{"text":"Very pleasant for lunch. Clean and bright atmosphere. Could use some vegetables in their bento box lunches. We'll go back again when in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I've ever been more annoyed at a restaurant.  I really wanted sushi (what I REALLY want around here is a sushi buffet, but I digress...), and we haven't tried any of the places around here yet.  Tomo happened to be closest to where we were at the moment, so we figured we'd give it a go.  We walked in, and I saw on the board \"All you can eat sushi, $21.95 on Sundays\".  Well it was Sunday, so I let out a squeal of excitement.  I asked the man at the door how it worked (was there a buffet of stuff set out? Did you order single pieces?), and he thrust a paper at me and said, \"This is the menu.  No sharing.  Finish what you order.  No takeout.\"  I got a little scared and said, \"OK, I'll just check out the regular menu.\"  Too many rules freak me out.  We asked for milk for our 3-year old, and the server said \"We don't have milk.\"   After he walked away, I saw milk on the menu.  So I asked about it.  \"We are out of milk,\" he replied.  Fine.  But when I go to a restaurant, if they're out of something I ask for, I prefer when they're at least a little apologetic and acknowledge that they usually have it, but don't at the moment.  I looked at the menu and decided on a combo.  When I started to order, the server said it was chef's choice.  It doesn't say \"Chef's Choice\" or \"Omakase\" anywhere.  The vibe I had been getting since we walked in made me a little nervous about letting the chef choose.  I figured maybe I'd just get the all you can eat because by the time I added up the al a carte pieces I wanted, I was over $20.  But then he told me that there are only rolls on the all you can eat menu.  That seems a little ridiculous because I could maybe eat 2 rolls before filling up and since you have to eat what you order, there's not much room to try new things or actually get your money's worth.  So I ordered a la carte.  And thankfully it was absolutely delicious.  Because that's really the only thing that made me want to give 2 stars instead of 1.  I also wish they had cheaper kids meals.  We paid $8.95 for a shrimp hibachi meal for the kiddo and it was more than even I would have been able to eat.  Great kids menus are cheaper with smaller portions in my opinion.  Most kids can't (and shouldn't) eat as much food as they put in front of him.  But again, it was really tasty.  There are other options in the area, so I can't imagine I'll ever be back here.  Service was not at all friendly.  They were quick because there were only a couple other people in there, but because they had nothing to do, I felt like they were just staring at us, and I don't like being stared at while I'm eating."}
{"text":"I gave four stars because the hibachi I get out of the kitchen is always very flavorful. It's a bit on the too flavorful side because the sauce is a bit syrupy. It tastes so good though. Also you can't go wrong with $7 hibachi for lunch. The only sushi rolls I've eaten we're California rolls and they always taste good. I took a star off because of the service. The waitresses never seem happy to be there and aren't very friendly. Other than that, it's one of my favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to every sushi bar in Cleveland and hands down (since Kimo's closed of course) this place is the best!  Some nights are better then others, and for the price if you want to eat good sushi, go on monday or tuesday for half price.  But on wendsday and thursday, (I'm assuming over the weekend too but I'm not sure) they have the BEST sushi chef!  As far as I'm concerned the only draw back is that they don't have a full bar, but a great sake menu, and the servers are great for suggestions!   I've never had hibachi there (not a big fan of it), but the apps are great as well, and you never have to wait long for your meal to arrive.  then again, I like to enjoy my dining experience, if you want to be given your rolls etc right after you place your order, they have probably been made in advance."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times for lunch and dinner. It's just OK, I pretty much only go on half price sushi days because I can't really justify the price for the quality of the sushi.   Service here also seems a bit awkward. Servers aren't too friendly, even when it's dead inside, and many times when I went for lunch, they would be standing around watching Cartoon Network, which was really loud in the background."}
{"text":"(first visit )First of all i walked in stood around for two minutes not sure whether or not to sit myself or be waited on it was 1 on a Wednesday. After i was  seated she took my order and brought me my ginger salad and miso soup. The soup was good but the salad was literally a hunk of wedge lettuce drenched in the dressing I was very disappointed. When i got the main hibachi lunch I was also very disappointed the rice was bland, and i was only served six shrimp(I feel personally it wasn't enough) All the employees were sitting in the corner on their phones not being attentive, one sneezed on his hands I pray to god he was going to wash his hands. I have been to many different hibachi places  and never have had such bad service as i have had here. The waitress seemed annoyed I was there and I will never go back!"}
{"text":"This being my FIRST written review of any restaurant, it's important that I share that this place was the most unprofessional place I've ever experienced. The management was indescribable and the waiters the same. You are better off spending your money ANYWHERE else who takes pride in a well trained staff who knows how to run a business."}
{"text":"I'm in college and like to go here on Monday or Tuesday nights to half priced Sushi. This restaurant seems to be getting better and more popular since i have started going there last year. This is not a fancy Japanese place, but overall pretty good. Sometimes have problems with the service though"}
{"text":"Tomo has been a favorite sushi place of mine since it opened.   The sushi is very good. Probably the best we've had in the area.   The food is fresh and attentively prepared. You can sit at the sushi bar or at a table.  There is ample seating.  I've never had to wait. There is also hibachi which I have never tried.  The hibachi area fills up and folks look they are having a good time. Service is always quick and attentive.  There is ample seating. I've only had to wait once or twice.   Prices are fair. Decor is minimalist with clean lines, light wood, and bamboo.  I like it. The atmosphere is  not over the top  like a lot of other places.  When I go for sushi, I go for the food, not so I can feel like I'm a Rock Star.   The restaurant is very clean. The green tea is spot on. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Tomo and truly enjoy their sushi on half price nights. We dined tonight with a friend of ours. They brought his food to the table about 20 minutes or so before ours was delivered. He was finished eating when our meals arrived which made it rather uncomfortable. The restaurant wasn't busy because we came earlier in the evening. I'd recommend mentioning to the server you want all the food at once."}
{"text":"Nice Hibachi and show but it is about the same as others.  They do have good food and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times in the past and can't believe I haven't yelped yet?!  I've been to all the sushi places in Strongsville and have to say Tomo's is the best, here's why...I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A BAD PIECE OF FISH!  I can't say that about the other places, plus they seem to be the most economical.  I can't give them 5 stars because there is usually a wait for the food to get to the table and the bathrooms are below average.  I have found that if you get here before 6:30 pm for dinner, service is way faster, I guess that should have been my tip, but it goes to show that there are places on yelp that are worth checking out that aren't 5 stars.  I have probably been here more than 12 times this year alone and will be back as often as I can.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Gotta ding them for my last visit. The service has actually improved somewhat since my last review, but the sushi quality, while never amazing, was bad even for their standards. I went with my go-to rolls of Eel Lover, Futomaki, and Summer--plenty of bites to determine what was wrong, and it was definitely the rice. I don't know if it was undercooked, or refrigerated, or not cooked with enough water, but it was just unpleasantly dry and tough.  Also, their restroom needed some severe cleaning. Urinals and sinks were clogged with brown water. I don't even know how. Is someone peeing brown?  I can only imagine this place has suffered with their downtown expansion, possibly transferring a lot of help to that location.  Still the place is decent for nonauthentic sushi on discount days, but even then the quality is hit or miss."}
{"text":"No fuss, authentic sushi at a good price. Usually that combination makes me nervous - but not in this case. Dined at the sushi bar twice on a recent business trip so I can not comment on the Hibachi portion. Overlook the unsexy strip center location."}
{"text":"I live in Cleveland Heights and on 1/2 price days (Monday and Tuesday) it makes the drive down there totally worth it.  I'm vegan, so I can't comment on the non-vegan sushi.  Their vegan sushi is limited.  They have an asparagus roll, an avocado roll, and a sweet potato roll.  The sweet potato one rules.  They fry the sweet potato in tempura batter which gives it a nice crust without making it super greasy.  They don't give you a discount if you do take out on 1/2 price days HOWEVER if you were to eat in and have some left over they'll gladly give you a box (which is what I do every time I'm there).  I do wish that they had a brown rice option for the sushi, I'd totally be okay paying a little more for that option.."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Tomo for sushi for at least 5 years. I used to rave about their sushi to everyone. I even got some of my friends to try sushi for the first time here. However, lately this restaurant has taken a serious turn for the worse. During my last visit the restaurant appeared filthy and neglected. The floors and tables were visibly sticky and dirty. I don't order water to drink any more because during my last few visits the water has tasted bad. The bathrooms smell terrible and don't ever appear clean. The locks on the bathroom doors don't work and there was no soap to wash your hands. This is disturbing because it also means there is no soap for the kitchen staff (who are preparing my food) to use after they go to the bathroom. GROSS. The service was also very slow....we waited more than 40 minutes for our food. Myself and a family member both came home with stomach aches.....and I just cant stop thinking how dirty the place was. A third member of our party did not get sick. He is the only person who did not use the bathroom. I won't be back. Which is a real shame because the food used to be the best Sushi in the area. Tomo needs an extensive scrubbing and a staff that is committed to cleanliness. Until then, eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Slow, slow, slow. Expensive. Poor quality. Bad Bathroom. This was definitely not worth the stop. Even for sushi and that's saying something in my book."}
{"text":"I've never had the hibachi here, only the sushi! The waitstaff is hard to understand and sometimes not all that attentive.  The sushi here has always been a-okay! If you come on Mondays and Tuesdays the sushi is half off. You can't beat three rolls for under $10! These rolls are full of flavor and generous in portions. They have more half off sushi options than Shinto, but Shinto's sushi is a better grade than Tomo. The wait is never as long as it is at Shinto so this is a legit place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Sushi not so oishi (tasty).  The first time I went, it was not so good, but I thought I'd give it a second chance, the second time was worse.  The wait staff was friendly but not very attentive.  The atmosphere is not very authentic and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"The decor of the restaurant is very nice.  The waiting staff is a little difficult to understand.  During rush hours the waiting staff does tend to leave you hanging which can be a let down.    The food is fairly priced and is good for what you pay.    The lunch time can take a little over an hour so if you're trying to get in and out you may be stretching it.   The sushi isn't bad but isn't that great either.  (Some days end up being better than others.)  The Hibachi is the better bet for those that want to get the most for their money.  Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Ate at Tomo last night.  The food and the chef were better than I remember.  This restaurant seems to be getting better.  But if you don't like to eat in a room full of kids, the hibachi section will disappoint you.  The fried rice was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is great, especially Monday and Tuesdays. Half off sushi. The sushi is fresh and very generous."}
