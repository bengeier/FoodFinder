{"text":"I had some business in Biddleville, a location in West Charlotte previously unknown to me. Did the biz, hit Yelp for a restaurant, and the Circle G came highly recommended. Family owned since 1954, the parking lot was packed, as was the inside. Sounds of happy diners swamped the place. I had a veggie omelette with hash browns and a banana strawberry pudding for dessert. I'm sort of glad I didn't know of this place or I would have eaten here way too often for my belly and bank account."}
{"text":"It's always a good time here. The servers are very nice and attentive. I never tried anything that didn't taste good here. Just good ol' comfort food. And they always have specials daily. Definitely a must try spot, you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Old fashioned cafe. Simple meat and three menu plus a bunch of sandwiches. 
Massive amount of food. 
Most of patrons work nearby."}
{"text":"LOVE circle G! I live nearby and it's always a great place to get some good ol southern food done right. Prices are super reasonable and portions are hugggge! the service is always great here. They sure do take care of you at the circle G!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and a soild menu.
This is old school dining at its best.
Service is receptive and quick. And there is never a wait for a table. Best time to go is 9am And 12noon before the huge rush of lunch folks start coming."}
{"text":"The server was a sweetheart but the food was nasty. I got Chicken Pan Pie with potato salad and fried squash. I took 1 bite of the potato salad and didn't eat anymore. The fried squash was soggy and bland. Other than the service, I was really disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Quick. Delicious. Cheap. Best meat and two joint in Charlotte. Daily specials are good and the sides are excellent. Order the fried okra and cornbread."}
{"text":"I am 58 years old I've been going to this restaurant since I was born. Add to my mother there every day when she was alive for over 15 years Sally owns the restaurant now. And I can tell you the food has never been better the waitresses or excellent if you're feeling down go in there when you leave you'll be feeling a lot better. Try the fried chicken anything on the breakfast menu and the country style steak.And the prices with them you could go every day of the week and it wouldn't hurt you but one thing you've got to try is the biscuits are makes you want to say amen"}
{"text":"The best of the best. Spicy chicken wrap and club are my favorites. The best macaroni and cheese I've ever had. Everyone is extremely friendly"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I decided to try a new place for lunch today. First off, if you don't know someone who knows this place you probably wouldn't go here on your own. The outside is nothing special, but when you pull in the parking lot is packed!! This is a place for a diner experience. 

When you walk in the seating options seem sort of limited (especially with it being packed for lunch), but I think there is more seating as you go back. Once we got there we were greeted and our waitress was fast with getting our drink order. She was also fast with getting us our check which is always appreciated.

This place has typical diner food with chicken tenders, meat loaf, fried chicken, sandwiches, salads, and hot subs! One thing that is a little weird about the menu is under the \"specials\" section, the sides listed under it in italics are the sides for the day. My coworker asked for fried okra (because it's for every other day) but it wasn't under Thursday's option so he couldn't get it. We could hear the mistake being made at 2 other tables! 

I ordered a bacon sandwich.. yes that's right! All bacon (it was a good portion of baco, with cheese, lettuce, and tomato on a hoagie. It was pretty good. The bread was tasty. My coworkers got the meatloaf with Mac n cheese and greens and the fried calabash shrimp with greens and fried squash. They both said it was really good esp. the greens. I don't like greens but they said they were surprisingly very good so you should try them! With the shrimp (which is what the one guy usually gets at any restaurant) said it was really good but the tarter sauce had a little too much mayonnaise in it. Also, I got honey mustard for my fries and it tastes exactly like Kens, which I'm not the biggest fan of but some people like it! 

Anyway, the food was pretty good but didn't blow me out of the water. The average price was about $8 for any dish. I wouldn't drive out of your way to eat here, but if you are in the area or looking for a new diner to try def check it out!! Overall good experience and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area. 

And P.S. my coworkers said the bathrooms are super super tiny!! So be ready for that!"}
{"text":"I work in the warehouse section of Charlotte and there really isn't any close restaurants except G's.  If you want fast good friendly service in a diner atmosphere, this is your place.  Food servings are bountiful and straight forward; not much creativity coming from the kitchen, but I would not expect that at a diner.  But the food is always hot and tasty.
I like their chicken salad plate: scoops of chicken salad over iceberg, hard boiled eggs, tomatoes, shredded cheese and crackers. Pretty filling.  Great sweet tea too!"}
{"text":"Good food good people great place breakfast all day Saturday and hot fried chicken 20 minutes  but worth the wait"}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte for 30+ years and today was the first day that I ever set foot into this restaurant.  WHAT A DUMMY I AM.  As others have said, the food is great, the service is wonderful and the price is right.  I had a three veggie plate for lunch today with cornbread and I left a very happy camper.  When I went at around 12:30 PM today, the parking lot was packed!  The restaurant has been around for decades!  Those are great indicators of a restaurant that knows what it is doing, and does it well.  I most definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Great as usual this a most for southern food. I always just trust the waitress (Liz and Christy) and their recommendations and the food is a blast! Not to mention the desserts. This is just a gem. Nice to see all the regulars eating."}
{"text":"Cool little diner with a southern touch. The 4 star rating is all about the service. They really treat you like one of the family! I have never been treated more pleasantly and been catered to better than at this place! The portions are huge. The food is good and fresh. The menu has plenty to offer."}
{"text":"I have not a single solitary complaint about this place. I love a good ol' country breakfast served with a generous side of southern hospitality! Plus, anywhere that serves livermush is all good in my book any day of the week.  The prices are excellent and honestly if you don't leave full you might have a tapeworm ?"}
{"text":"Best place ever!!!!! I've been going here since I was a baby. The food @Circle G is always delicious & the servers treat everyone like family."}
{"text":"This place has great customer service and even better food! No matter how busy they get the service is always prompt . One of the few mom and pop places around."}
{"text":"Great food low prices and good service a great place for breakfast the hash browns are killer quite a hidden gem that has been there since 1954"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast!  Having said that,  I have never had their lunch or dinner.   Their food is freshly prepared, comes in large portions, and down-home good.  Service is very friendly and super speedy even on packed weekend mornings."}
{"text":"Good stuff - great service - big menu - looks like a lot of good options to choose from....and it is always busy"}
{"text":"Walk in and seat yourself.  Found a table on a busy Saturday morning.  Hard working servers but lacked that southern charm that would have given it the 5 stars.  Food was great."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  Homestyle country cooking at this place. Chicken and dumplings, fried bologna and egg sandwich, biscuits and gravy, you name it, it's all good!  Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"This spot is near my work & I usually eat here once a week. It's an old diner, if you're looking for an upscale feel keep going but you'll be missing a gem. They have great country plates, sandwiches, subs etc. I've never really been disappointed with anything here. They have different specials everyday with reasonable prices. The staff is also very friendly & accommodating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Susan is the BEST waitress I have ever had! She remembers my orders and drink. I thoroughly enjoy this place. It's the best kept little secret on the northwest side of town! It feels like family every time I arrive."}
{"text":"This place is a complete hole in the wall dive smack dab in the middle of the West side's trucking industry. The food...DELICIOUS! It's packed on a Saturday morning but the wait staff does a great job trying to wrangle in the line jumpers and impatient people all vying for a coveted table. I always order the circle G special and they give you a generous portion. The hash browns are my favorite and because of that I haven't eaten anything else on the menu....I should try something new next time. You won't be disappointed at this gem of a diner!"}
{"text":"I love this place. If you want to come and see what's offered you gotta make it in early because they close at 3pm and arent open on Sundays. However; they do open up super early like 530am and have an outstanding selection for breakfast and they serve it all day on Saturdays. I've had it all from the spanish omelets to the ribeye steak and eggs, cornbeef hash, turkey bacon, huge pancakes, french toast etc! Dinners are great too fish, burgers, steak n cheese, fried chicken (so delicious), mac & cheese,fries, salads these folks serve everything and its yummy!"}
{"text":"I have been twice, and both times were back to back days. This place is awesome, food is on point. I can eat here every day, and would get the strawberry banana pudding every time. The sweet tea here is even awesome, gonna make this my new go-to lunch spot."}
