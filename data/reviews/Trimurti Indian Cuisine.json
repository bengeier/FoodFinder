{"text":"Great selection of Indian breads including vegetable-filled paranthas and kulchas.   Quick service, although we did have to ask for them to bring us raita. Dinner for two with two beers came to about $40, so not overly pricey.  Chicken zaphrani (Saffron chicken) came sizzling on a hot plate with lots of delicious onions."}
{"text":"I have read some reviews stated that 'best naan in the town'.  So I visited there. But the naan bread was not like the traditional north Indian one. Rest of the curries and rice are OK. Not 'the best'. Can try one or two times."}
{"text":"I lived in New York for a few years and regularly ate some of the best Indian food on this continent. When I moved back to Toronto last summer, I was initially disappointed with the Indian restaurants downtown... until I tried Trimurti.  The staff are an eclectic mix of characters who might put you off with their intensity at first, but really just care about getting it right. My girlfriend and I journey there from High Park every few weeks and enjoy the Butter Chicken (with extra spice) and Saag Paneer (Fresh cheese in stewed spinach). The mango lassi is fantastic, if expensive for the portion. The naan is best in class. The wine prices are quite reasonable - litre of house wine for $23, decent bottles from $25-35.  I'll reiterate: Trimurti makes the best Indian food I've had in Toronto. Don't take my word for it - go try it!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Trimurti for 5 years. I still love their food but I won't be ordering from them again.   They didn't deliver my rice that I paid for this evening. When I called to let them know the manager refused to send someone with the rice and would only say he would comp rice on my next order. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"For my money, this is the best Indian restaurant on that stretch of Queen street between University and Spadina. We usually get the Murgh Tikka (boneless chicken cooked in the tandoori oven) and it's great. The cheese cooked in the tandoori oven is also very good. I think Babur, a few doors down, tends to be more popular, but I think Trimurti is a lot better.  The staff is very nice. I believe the chef used to work at Nataraj on Bloor. If you order for take out and tell then you'll pay cash, they'll take 10% off the bill."}
{"text":"I didn't have a particular craving tonight, but went with Indian. I figured I would try something new and so I went with Trimurti.   Now, maybe it's better at the restaurant. I ordered in and I can't say that I enjoyed it all that much.   The naan was rubbery and the food was a little gooey. I enjoyed the first few bites, and then I just got bored. When something says \"hot and spicy\" on the menu, especially Indian food, I expect tears to be flowing. And that just wasn't the case.  I had the Butter Chicken and the Lamb Vandaloo, pretty safe choices and a pretty bland result.  If you're in Queen West and looking for a good Indian restaurant, skip this one and travel a little further down the road to Apalla."}
{"text":"We have been ordering Trimurti for years and last night was the first time that I had been in the restaurant. It's not surprising that the food was even better coming out of the kitchen. There were 9 of us and I think that we ordered everything!   Other than the amazing Butter Chicken & Naan, we had the Tikka Cauliflower as per the suggestion of the waiter. It was a full head that came out sizzling - this would not have worked for delivery. The waiters were great and the restaurant was full.   **if you on the west end and have a craving for Indian food, go go go! **"}
{"text":"OMG What happened to this place?  This restaurant USED to have the best butter chicken and excellent service. We've been coming to this place for years.   The quality of the food and the service has gone down. The butter chicken was bland. It used to be so creamy with a nice smokey taste to it. We complained that we asked for spicy and it came out as mild. When we told the server she said to ask for hot next time. It's funny because when we looked at the receipt it said butter chicken with the word \"hot\" next to it.   The naan was ok. The papadam was stale. The rice was bland and the baigan bharta was flat.   The servers did not seem like they cared (they forgot one of our drinks, did not refill our water, did not check on us, and when we asked for more of the red sauce to go with our chicken pakoras it never came) and we are NEVER going back.  Savera (St. Clair) my #2 pick has now been elevated to #1. They do a mean baigan bharta...yummy!"}
{"text":"Ive gone back  here and its still very blah. the service was below average to say the least and the food temp was as though it was sitting out for a long time."}
{"text":"I eat take-out from here almost weekly. Tasty and always enough for a dinner and a lunch when I order 1 curry, 1 rice, and a kulcha.  Staples include: Garlic kulcha, lamb madras, chicken kadai, boti kebab, and bhindi masala.  Spice levels are pretty low here though, so even their spiciest dishes aren't that hot. Still decently spiced."}
{"text":"The service at Trimurti is outstanding.  I like that there is no particular waiter-to-tables assignment.  When I was there, there was a team of four wait staff  who collectively  serviced all the tables.  My seat was facing the back end of the restaurant and I observed that they all stood in attention, watching watching out for tables that might need their attention.  There was no personal chit-chat among the wait staff, and I never had to ask for a water re-fill as there was always someone walking around to replenish them.  They were courteous and respectful and focused on getting *you* serviced (as opposed to your usual perky waiters bopping around and pretending to be your best friend).    And the food, of course, was excellent.  My partner and I ordered Chili Paneer, Chicken Briyani, Two orders of naan, raita, and Mango Lassi.  Now, I'm the type of gal who makes a lot of moaning noises when I eat good food, and believe me, I was moaning a lot when I ate.  The paneer was fresh and airy.  Watch out for those chilis!  The chicken in the briyani was tender and moist.  The dishes comes to your table in ornate siver serving bowls.  There are a lot of vergetarian options in this place, and I imagine here is a paneer version for every carnivourous dish.  I highly recommend Trimurti and Iwill definitely go back!"}
{"text":"when i walked in, immediately thought to myself this was a typical indian buffet. the server barely even acknowledged our (two indian and one chinese american) existence. dude in the back having a conversation over the phone with someone asking what kind of food is in the buffet and gave a very non-descriptive response back with \"lots of meat and veggie options.\" but as soon as a white couple came in the server was extremely friendly and vocal. very typical.  the food overall was very good. my only gripes were that the naan came out late and the beef vindaloo was dry. other than that, everything else was awesome. three different types of rice, multiple pakora, lots of different curries. the standout dish was most def the tandoori chicken. super flavorful and juicy. usually tandoori is very dry at most buffets.   dont forget the deserts yo - hella options here as well. jalebi, gulab jamun, and kheer were all on point. of course it felt like diabetes was imminent after consumption but that's precisely how it should feel.   great spot for a lunch buffet in a great location."}
{"text":"My partner and I had dinner here on March 1st after reading a Yelp review.  The restaurant fell distinctly short of 4 stars as advertised.  Our 3 star rating is being charitable.  2-2.5 stars is probably more accurate.  We shared an onion bhaji as a starter.  It was a big dish which my partner liked.  I didn't care for it nearly as much.  The dipping sauces provided at the table were inadequate and not tasty.  My partner had a chicken dish that was OK in its taste but looked like slop, if you'll forgive the word.  I had the lamb Madras, which was indifferent.  I've had better.  We both agreed the rice was terrific.  We both thought the garlic nan hardly edible.  It was greasy, limp, and didn't have much taste.  We in fact wondered if it was garlic nan at all.  By that time we were thinking of getting our coats and heading back to the Royal York for a drink, which we did.  We will not eat at  Trimurti in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight - it took just under an hour. We had tandoori chicken, butter chicken, their white rice and some naAn bread. The butter chicken was simply delicious!! The tandoori chicken was also really great! The naan bread is probably my favourite as I can't seem to get enough... I had 2 tonight and can't stop dreaming about enjoying just one more, dipped in my butter chicken leftovers.   Overall, really great. The rice was a little cool but the deliciousness (/temperature) of the other dishes made up for that!"}
{"text":"Well, there is one block on Queen Street that has 3 Indian restaurants practically next door to each other. All 3 offer lunch, all you can eat buffets, for the same price. All 3 offer pretty much the same dinner menu with equally similar prices.  We have tried all 3 for both lunch and dinner and although all are good, we feel that Trimurti is the best of the three. The food is fresher, more flavorful and not watered down. You will get a wonderful curry sauce that is creamy and filling and the portions are huge. I am a vegetarian so to all those veggies out there, there is an abundance of vairety to choose from and the buffet always has 6 hot veggie dishes. My wife is a meat eater and loves the lamb and the shrimp dishes.  Also, I want to mention the wonderful Mr. Alpa who was our waiter both times we were there. He went out of his way to help us with selection of dishes and was always attentive to our needs. In fact, he overheard me telling my wife that I had a craving for a spinach salad and although it was not on the dinner menu, he said he would have the chef make it up for me. He did and it was delicious!!! Thank you Alpa.  Again, all 3 restaurants are good but there is definitely a worst, middle and best and Trimurti was the best of the 3 in terms of quality of food and customer service.  Jerry and Kat"}
{"text":"My friend and I came upon this place as the result of a google search for \"best Indian restaurants in Toronto\". Our server Alap was very friendly and couldn't have provided better service, and we had our waters refilled multiple times by a polite young Indian fellow (didn't get his name).   We ordered Tarka Dal, Butter Chicken and Lamb Gosht Vindaloo, with a side of basmati rice, all to share. We asked for everything to be spicy and it all turned out to have just the right amount of flavourful hot. The food was amazing and the bill only came to about $38 for the 4 items. Will definitely visit this place again next time I'm downtown and craving Indian."}
{"text":"Worst, worst delivery service ever.  I ordered 3 dishes.  I live a block away from this place and they told me it would take an hour.  I thought it was a bit long to wait but decided okay because I was in the mood for Indian.  It took over 2 hours to get my order. Are you kidding me?  The food was cold and the naan was the most rubbery thing I've ever eaten.  There's too many good Indian places in this city to waste your money on this place.  There are 2 Indian places right next door that have way better food. I only ordered from this place because I had their menu.  Big regret."}
{"text":"I usually avoid AYCE buffets but I was with two voracious eaters and figured they'd get their fill at the troughs here. Well, color me impressed. The offerings at Trimurti's lunch buffet were not just plentiful, they were tasty and well presented.   They have a nice assortment of starters including salad, pappadum and chutneys. I'd skip the samosas. They were no longer warm and had become leaden with dough. The butter chicken lived up to its name and was buttery. I thought the real winners were the vegetarian dishes: mutter paneer; spinach stewed with chickpeas; and eggplant with potatoes. Great, great, and great.  My one quibble is that the naan had been sitting out too long and had become spongey. But, really, all this for $10.95 per person -- I really can't complain too much.   Oh, and the lunch buffet includes ice cream -- yay!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Great portions, great prices!!!  I like Babur too but I can't afford their prices, and their portions are way too small.  Trimurti has outstanding portions...yummmmmm"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Trimurti because of the hype. Unfortunately, my experience here was less than average. I came to Trimurti with my hubby on a weekday evening; the place is not that big, the tables somewhat close together, clean and simple.   They have a variety of Indian dishes on their menu that included soups, appetizers, seafood, non-vegetarian and vegetarian meals, Indian breads and desserts. They also had a nice selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages too.   We had two waiters serving us- one was okay and confused and the second in a miserable mood which made the dining experience rather uncomfortable. We started off with mango lassi's (yogurt shake with pure mango pulp $3.75), and chicken pakoras ($4.95). The mango lassi was one of the best I've had, but for the price they give you very little and over iced the drink. The chicken pakoras were delish- crispy, hot, and had tender white meat inside.   For our mains we had malai kofta ($8.95), chicken badam pasanda ($11.50) and naan bread ($1.95). The portion size was okay, nothing generous. The malai kofta consisted of potatoes and cheese balls cooked in a cashew sauce. The kofta was okay but the cream sauce was thick and tasteless. I dug into the chicken badam pasanda with hope but that too was gross. The chicken badam pasanda consisted of boneless chicken cooked in a creamy cashew sauce. The chicken was tender and the sauce was nauseatingly thick and creamy which overwhelmed the chicken. Also, neither dish had any spice to it. I did not feel like I was eating Indian food at all, and that's coming from someone who is Indian.   Trying these cream based curries here was a big mistake; I didn't even finish my food, which took forever to come to our table in the first place. I will give glory to their naan bread though! The bread was baked to perfection and was hot, fresh and stretchy.  Overall, Trimurti didn't make it in my books. Their slow miserable service and scary cream main dishes had me running out their door. I think I'll stick to the other Indian restaurant options that are in the area instead."}
{"text":"Trimurti is my fav. place to get some amazing Navrantan Korma. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Best naan bread I've had in a very long time! And it was really cool to watch them making it in the ovens. Having said that, the curries, whilst appetising on the menu, weren't as great as Yelp had made them out to be. My lamb korma was bland, and my rice didn't come out until well after my curry - at which point I had filled up on curry and naan. I'd be willing to give it another shot though, and it's definitely worth it for the bread!"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. Well priced. Attentive service. Try the butter chicken that has more kick than usual"}
{"text":"I wish I couldn't give this place no stars at all We were about 8-10 people called the restaurant before we went to reserve it for dinner Worst service  Didn't offer the menus or anything to drink  Food came after 2hrs of placing the order & on top off that all the food was bought in installments & food had no flavor... This place is all screwed up ..."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Indian food I've eaten for the price. The funny thing about Trimurti is there are probably 3 other Indian Restaurants within 30 feet of eachother.  This is the one you want to go to!  It also is amazing for lunch buffet. If you are inexperianced with Indian food the buffet lets you pick and choose and really figure out what is what and more importantly what you dig.  The Naan bread is killer as well. I recommend the Butter Chicken and ordering a bowl of rice per person, it goes pretty fast if shared... or maybe I just love it too much.  One negative is the wait time can be a little bit when it's busy. Def check it out."}
{"text":"I am so surprised at the number of positive reviews about this place.   I went here with three people a few months ago. We ordered several dishes. They did not arrive at our table for over an hour. The waiter didn't explain or apologize about the slowness or offer us anything to nibble while we waited. We considered leaving and going elsewhere, but we were starving by this point and the idea of waiting another half an hour somewhere else was not appealing. When the food finally arrived, one of the dishes was wrong. We were given chicken vindaloo when we'd ordered lamb. We pointed this out to the server, and he argued with us, insisting that the order was correct and that we had gotten it wrong, which we hadn't. After waiting an hour for the food to arrive, we definitely knew what was coming to us. Finally, we accepted it, and ate our meal. After some time, the server came by and told us we wouldn't have to pay for that dish. And then he placed a stack of toonies and loonies on the table for the vindaloo, explaining that this had come out of his own pocket. Like he couldn't bring up the mistake with his manager or just take it off the bill? We were so shocked by this that we had no idea what to even say. A waiter placing change down on the table for a mistake on a dish?!   The food was pretty good but this service was so appalling. I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Starter- dry and cold. Forgot the condiments .  Main course-We could not enjoy because we could not get passed starter. Still waiting for nearly two hours to get delivery. Appalling service. Don't waste your money and time here."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service compared to two other Indian restaurants beside it. Took the server 20 mins to give us menu after which it only got worst. Our drinks and food arrived 40 minutes after we ordered and after few bits I found a hair in my naan. We pointed out to the service and they didn't do anything about - not even replacement for the food we found the hair in! Showed that they are failing at every level from service to setting to Hygiene. I wonder how filthy their kitchen might be inside. I wouldn't be surprised if people get food poisoning here. Their standards are lowest and food is disgusting. I would never step in there again and I recommend the other restaurants over this one."}
{"text":"Didnt listen to the other reviews and went anyway.  Butter chicken was probably the least flavorful I've ever had. When it's at the point where I personally think I could cook a better one, something is up.  Prices are too high. $4 for basmati rice???   From now on I trust yelpers 100%"}
{"text":"The Indian food was as good as it gets. Did not try a variety since my husband only will eat boring Tandoori. However, he made ME eat my words by ordering the BEST tandoori chicken I have ever had.  I had Chicken Masala which was naan licking good!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"With the demise of NATARAJ which was easily the best indian food in the city, I began a quest for a replacement.  I will say Trimurti serves consistently great food. Their tandoori chicken is by far the best one I have tasted in a seriously long time. Service is solid.  There are several indian restos concentrated here, namely Babar and Little India. I would say all are good but of the the three, Trimurti gets my vote."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, good decor  Food: great value for the price;  I ordered an eggplant dish and I enjoyed the smokiness of the flavor. At first it doesn't look like a lot, but in the end I couldn't finish half of it!  I also ordered the naan. Nice large piece and fit well with the eggplant. Couldn't finish that either. My dinner partner couldn't finish his portion either.   Service: attentive and friendly They also make good recommendations.   Decor: Good Enjoyed the Indian theme paintings hanging on the wall"}
{"text":"Go here for the food not the decor. Close to the same selections as little India. Same interior space.  The food is great. The butter Chicken is better here, same with the chickpea curry and tandoori chicken, beef roganjosh,  vegetable pakoras, and the naan bread  almost tasting sourdough unique.  So far the best place I've been to on Queen St for Indian food. Enjoyed their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"While the Butter Chicken was good, the overall selection on the buffet was limited and the service was poor. I came here for a late lunch and was shown a table then ignored while I waited for the waiter to bring water and Naan to my table after going through the buffet. I had to get up and get my own glass of water from the bar area and only then did the waiter lift a finger.  I really cannot fathom how Trimurti gets a four star average here on Yelp."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fresh naan I've ever had. Lamb vindaloo had a good amount meat and was decently spiced, but heavy on the salt. Waiter recommended a veggie jalfrezie type dish that included paneer, it was delish. Yum yum for quick inexpensive dinner:)"}
{"text":"Ate here with a big group family style; all of the entrees were very good, I especially liked the Bharta and the Chicken Tikka. Rice was good, the Nan & Kulchas just OK. Service was friendly, but the food took forever- was starving by the time it came. Also, they kept trying to push Cheetah beer on us which I'm not a fan of. Overall though, good Indian grub."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars ... 4 stars plus!?  Only got to eat here once on the way to Toronto Opera, but it was an excellent first. My brother and I shared garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, vegetable jalfrezie, and regular basmati rice. (Thought it was a little strange that we had to separately order rice. Maybe it's a Canadian thing?) The vegetable jalfrezie was my FAVORITE! Deliciously fresh and appropriately spicy. Thank you, Trimurti!  We arrived about 5 PM, and they were reasonably timely about getting the food out to us; it was leaving the restaurant that took awhile. After 6 PM this medium-small size restaurant became capital-p Packed. Maybe it was the party reserved for 14?  Anyhow -- beat the crowd -- it is worth it. Yum!"}
{"text":"I like Trimurti quite a lot. Good range of dishes and flavours, with some standouts. Fairly healthy, fair prices and convenient location."}
{"text":"I could eat Indian food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I've eaten 2 out of the  3 at Trimurti and I'll get dinner there almost once a week. The staff are all quite nice and will help you with the menu, if you don't know your pakora from your paneer. The saag paneer made Trimurti-style is what I've come to expect at all restaurants. It's my favorite. If you like spicy, the Shrimp Vindaloo is my fave! It's packed full of large shrimp covered in a savory, spicy broth, with a few potatoes thrown in."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. The service was absolutely amazing.  This was my second time eating Indian food, both times in Toronto.  The night before, we went to Babur, while the food there was good, the service was horrible.  We had long conversations with two waiters here at Trimurti, both of them were so great to talk to.   We started off with the veggie samosas which had the perfect amount of spice.  I don't remember the name of the dishes my boyfriend and I ordered but the chicken in both dishes was perfect, so I would imagine any dish here would be just as amazing.  We got a side order of naan and basmati rice which perfectly complemented our food.   The price of the food was less than Babur and way better.  This place was extremely welcoming and we will definitely be back if we return to Toronto."}
{"text":"As we perused the menus of the cluster of Indian restaurants along Queen West, they all had pretty identical price points & menus, so we decided on Trimurti to avoid walking back 10 steps (no time for exercise, I was hungry!)  Ordered the Gosht Rogan Josh (lamb) with naan to go. Wait times were decent and he was kind enough to give me a 10% discount (perks of being a cute little asian, perhaps?) and threw in a couple of pappadums...but only when I got home & opened up the food did I realize I was given rice instead of naan :(   Anywho, I liked the fact that after a 10 minute walk home, the food was still HOT. Lamb was real tender & though it didn't claim to be a spicy dish, I would have preferred the just-ate-something-super-spicy-and-it-feels-like-i-just-worked-out kinda feeling. enh, next time i suppose.    I'd say I wouldn't mind coming back to cure my next hankering for Indian, but either of the other two restaurants beside it would be fair game as well."}
{"text":"trimurti is one of my favourite indian restaurants in toronto! the last time i went there, 3 of us were competing to wipe up every last drop of the chili paneer with the naan. if i wasn't dining at a restaurant, i would've licked the bowl clean. the tandoori cauliflower dish looks like a giant red brain sizzling on a plate of bell peppers and onions. the tandoori paneer wasn't as good so i'll stick with the cauliflower next time.  i've had the lunch buffet before and it's a great deal!  i prefer trimurti over nataraj because it's not as oily. each dish has its own distinct flavour. at some restaurants, the curries all start to taste the same but not at trimurti!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service ,the overall pace of the meal was slow but not excessively so.   I started with the onion bhaji, these are the biggest I have ever seen about the size of a cricket ball ( or baseball for the Americans amongst us ) and you get two. These were followed by the lamb saag and an onion kulcha.   The saag was delicious but a little too salty for my taste I was looking for a fire hydrant near the end of it, the kulcha was excellent, they have their own tandoor and the breads cannot be any fresher.   Drinks were a Cheetah lager , not too impressed ,an IPA would have been a better choice , then the dependable Kingfisher.   I don't know about the other restaurants on this Indian row, but Trimurti is excellent and worthy of all the praise and your custom."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto from the Northern Virginia area.  To give some reference points, I am South Indian, and I was not eating meat during this  meal.  So I was looking for purely vegetarian options.   I had eaten at Queen Mother Cafe, which is right opposite this Trimurti, the night before, so I thought I would come back to this area, and have an indian meal.  We walked from University Ave, west on Queen, on the South Side, and passed 2 other indian restaurants before we came to this establishment.  While we were standing outside, one of the employees came out and stated that he was from Calcutta, and that he thought that the Chef here was very good.  We had our reservations, since this was the only one of the three indian restaurants on this street that seemed to be empty.    We walked in, and the waiter seated us at the very first seat right in front of the window.  We were looking to move a bit back, but he kept recommending that seat.  It was a bit tight to get in, since both of us were carrying a few items back to the hotel.  I jokingly suggested that our placement was to block visibility to the rest of the restaurant so that others couldn't see how empty the restaurant was.   We waited for the waiter, who came by after a few minutes.  I asked him if we could have the appetizer sampler with only vegetarian appetizers.  This seemed to be a simple request.  He suggested that Hara Kebab and Paneer Pakora, which came out to roughly the same cost.  I said I wanted to think about it.  Since it seemed we we couldn't get what I requested, i was going to agree to his suggestion.  He checked with the chef, and they said they could support this.    Additionally, we ordered, Mattar Paneer and Paneer Badam Pasanda.     They brought out some papad with some various sauces.  This was ok.  The appetizers were again ok.  The entrees really were too bland for my liking.  I have eaten at numerous indian restaurants at home and on business trips, and this was not that great considering the reviews, and the employee coming out and recommending it (agreed the employee is biased.).    While the food was just ordinary, I think the disturbing aspects to me were a few things.   1. The entrees did not come with rice.  My friend asked the waiter, which I thought was wierd.  Most of the restaurants I frequent come with plain rice, and you can add various breads or fancier rices if you'd like.  We ordered aloo parata and naan.  These were the best things out of the meal.   2. I thought while the restaurant was empty, we would get more attention from the waiters, and more responsive service.  Instead, it appeared that they were standing around at the back of the restaurant watching the tv.  In order to get more water and the check, it was a chore.  A restaurant with 1 couple in it, should not take that much time or effort to get service.  To be honest, I was starting to wonder if I could get a decent meal experience in toronto.  This was the fourth food experience of my trip.    Additionally, we didn't order any alcohol or other drinks. Just water, so the cost was about $11-30/person"}
{"text":"The entrance to Trimurti is easy to miss, it's very small and on a funny angle. If you do happen to notice it, it's definitely worth while to step inside. To start, I had the mixed appetizer platter. Everything was delicious, and the dipping sauce was great and a little sweet. My only complaint about it is they only gave one samosa. Given the size of platter, it's clearly made for splitting so it's kinda funny to give one of something. For my main, I had the butter chicken. It was creamy and tangy, just the way I like it! It came with a generous helping gravy to dip the naan bread. Speaking of naan; the garlic naan was gigantic... which is awesome!  Everything was delicious and reasonably priced. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"After trying 3 Indian lunch AYCE buffets in one week this one totally takes the cake... or the Gulab jamun, if you will  As many have said there are a row of Indian restos on within 5 steps.  And most prefer Little India (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/little-india-restaurant-toronto#hrid:_ouzJmtcw2rftaD8Fha7JQ).  I'm gonna be the rebel that chooses Trimurti.  And because everyone has the pros/cons i'll just list you the comparative notes:  1) Little India has a larger selection- and fruit and better salad (if you want fruit and salad go to Little India) but the QUALITY of the actual Indian hot food is 90% better.  And If you want fruit and salad I suggest you go to a market.    2) The ONE make it or break it dish is the PANEER dishes for me.  I love my indian cheese.  I can eat it by the barrel full.  While Little India has good paneer for the dinner session when it is fresh- the buffet paneer is OBVIOUSLY left overs from last night.  kind of hard, not plentiful, and spongey like soy/tofu.  And I usualy like the spinach panneer (palak) and Trimirti didnt' have that.  but they DID have mutter paneer (peas) and it was SO FRICKIN GOOD.   Stupid me, I tried the mutter paneer on the second plate and didnt' have enough room to scarf it down. had I known I would have just taken the metal pot from the buffet to my table.  3) the service is better.  yeah, the service is good at both.  But I like it 100% better when they bring the naan TO you.  Call me lazy, but I feel almost as if I have to go back to teh table and drop off all the sauces and breads before I can sit down to get a plate of food.  haha..yeah, i'm lazy...  4) THEY MADE TO ORDER SOMETHING FOR MY FRIEND.  We went in a large group and my friend is allergic to approximately EVERYTHING.  they took her to the kitchen so she could ask how things are made and it turns out they use vegge oil and soy or meat in everything .  my poor friend was at a loss as all of us had already started to stuff our faces.  The chef whipped up something to accommodate her allergies.  Now given I didn't give Little India the chance to appease my allergic friend- so I dont' know if they would do the same) I think that is pretty Kickass that they would go to such lengths.  5) the chicken is still MOIST.  I find Little India to have really dry chicken.  6) The decor is better.  I like my Indian restos a bit lighter/brighter inside.  The golden interior is a nicer eating environemtn than a dark red, methinks.  so very inconsequential as a comparative point but worth saying for any of you who want to hold meetings over lunch (which I do frequently and I actually did see in the resto).  Overall we KNOW Indian lunch buffets are the leftovers from the night before but refreshed.  But Trimutri does a 100% better job in hiding this fact. @ Little India, the overnight paneer, the dry chicken and the uncrispy tortilla things are all things that I could let go for the cheap price...but why would I have to now that I have Trimutri?"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  I came here with a few of my friends and we ordered a bunch of stuff to share. At first, we thought that it wouldn't be enough (4 dishes for 5 people, plus naan, paratha and rice) but it ended up being more than enough!  My favourite dish was the Baigan Ka Bharta (Eggplant baked in Tandoor, smashed & sauteed with green peas, tomatoes & spices). It was just incredibly flavourful, with a nice texture, and went great with the rice, naan and paratha. I may have eaten half the dish... we also had:  Gosht Saag (Lamb/beef cooked with spinach & fresh spices): great sauce, but the lamb was a little dry.   Subzi Do-Piaza (Mixed vegetables, mushrooms, peas, cheese, cooked with onion sauce, garnished with tomatoes & spring onions): very good, but the mushrooms were kind of big.  Saag Paneer (Cottage cheese cooked in onion & spinach): My friends enjoyed it, said that the cheese was nice and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  The bread and rice were also really great.  I will definitely return and try their other dishes!!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I hit Trimurti for a paneer bender, one rainy and chilly night.  Service was great, the paneer was delectable, and the curries were very good.  Taaaaasty, and the perfect remedy for a messy December evening.  Dig in, then get a cup of masala tea."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Trimurti after walking up and down queen street looking for something good to eat for lunch (we couldn't decide so we settled on the closest Indian restaurant).  They were offering a 13 dollar lunch buffet. I am often skeptical about buffets however, the food was well made, fresh and authentic. They offered many different types of curry, butter chicken, nan, and other typical Indian dishes.  Overall the deliciousness of the food exceeded the 13 dollars for lunch. Very delicious and I would likely return."}
{"text":"Tried their delivery service today for dinner. Online ordering process was fast and efficient. Food arrived hot within one hour   Apart from the lack of spice despite asking that the food be prepared medium spiced -  food was excellent. The Afghani chicken included nice juicy boneless pieces of chicken and the butter chicken was addictive.   -1 star for the lack of spice, and -1 star for forgetting to add coriander/mint chutney with the tandoori dishes (I specially asked for it in the comments section so they wouldn't forget). Overall good North Indian food - they just need to improve on the little things that do matter!   P.s. Lived in india for several years and travelled around the country so I'm very fussy when it comes to Indian food."}
{"text":"I was wandering down Queen Street looking for a place to eat on my first business trip to Toronto in many years.  Gotta say that the City is looking good!  World class! Great work for all involved.  My compliments.  My stomach started to growl as I walked past Trimurti. Not knowing anything about the dining in downtown, but liking Indian cuisine, the impulse overcame me and I went in.   Good decision.  The place is narrow and deep, with well dressed tables on either wall, and the kitchen in the rear.  A waiter led me to a deuce towards back, as the room was about a third full.  The aromas had my salivarys off the hook with the combination of curry, tumeric and garlic.  I ordered an Indian Beer and checked the menu.  I was dining alone, and did not want too much left over to carry back to the hotel, so I went with Chicken Jalifrezi, Garlic Naan, Mango Lassi, and Basmati Rice.    As some others here have commented, everything was excellently presented and tasty.  I love Mango Lassis and order them at every occasion.  This one was very good, but not over generous in size.  The Garlic Naan was wonderful, and I used every morsel of it to sop up the creamy delicious Jalifrezi Sauce.  The chunks of chicken breast and thigh were tender and played so well in my mouth with the other ingredients.  Bottom line - I walked back to the hotel a sated (perhaps, over-sated) and happy guy. I knew I would return to Trimurti again.  Why not 5 stars?  The prices were higher than I am used to for good Indian food (although the exchange rate could have something to do with that), and the Lassi glass was too quickly empty."}
{"text":"Stumbled on to this place while walking in the rain.  Gave it a try and was not disappointed.  Staff is friendly and takes your order without writing it down!  Love the Garlic Naan and the Butter chicken.  Have been here 3 times already and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Consequently tired of strolling only on trivial basis along Queen Street, just so to keep up with the 'cool kids'. (You guys walk really fast!)  Beyond the discernible vanity shops and all the tangible beauty, it's quality also exists in a more prudent greeting. Trimurti Indian Cuisine allows a pause to sit down and rest. The decor is exceptionally average and does show restraint of any kitsh narration. We had the thali (which is not mention on the menu) and lamb in a lush curry sauce. The portions are suggestive of being minimal and sparsed, though we we're not able to finish our plates. The servings are almost philanthropic!  One flaw: our waiter kept on spilling water when filling up our glasses."}
{"text":"Great little place on queen street. The staff was attentive and the food was delish. If you are new or a veteran, you won't be disappointed. As an American from south Florida, the chicken tikka masala is my favorite. Here in Toronto the closest thing would be the butter chicken , but it's not quite as spicy. If you want them to bring the heat go with the lamb vindaloo.   We met great new friends at the table behind us.  If you are in Florida and are looking for a place to live check out www.mangroverealty.com."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but the service was atrocious.   The hubby and I wandered in at around 8pm during a particularly harsh cold snap -- it was -20C outside, and we really wanted warm and spicy Indian comfort food. We came in, and were offered a seat in the front of the restaurant, right next to the door. (Did I mention that it was NEGATIVE TWENTY outside?) \"Oh, we're kind of cold,\" I said. \"Do you mind if we sit farther away from the door?\" \"Well, there's a heater right here,\" the restaurant-guy said, pointing to a heater by the door. I protested again, but gave up when he insisted that it was going to be warm enough. I'm not exactly sure why he was kept insisting on making us sit by the door (heater or no heater) when the restaurant was basically empty, but... okay, whatever. FWIW, even though there was a heater we still got hit with an arctic blast every time someone came in or out of the restaurant. That sucked.    Our visit went downhill from there. We ordered three dishes: Kachumbor Salad (remember that one, it'll become important in a second), Mattar Paneer, and Murgh Tikka. The person who took our order didn't write anything down, but did repeat our order before walking away. At least, I *thought* he repeated our order. When the order finally came, he brought Mattar Paneer and... Channa Masala (the latter of which I didn't order; I ordered the Kachumbor Salad).  As soon as the server set down the Channa Masala, I told him that it wasn't what I ordered. He said, \"Yes, this is what you ordered. Channa Masala. I repeat to you.\" To which I said, \"No, I ordered Kachumbor Salad.\" Really, this was a simple mistake -- the two things sound the same if you say them quickly. Or maybe my being cold from being seated near the front door on a NEGATIVE TWENTY night was impeding my speech. Regardless, the server was ridiculously rude about the whole affair; no apologies were offered, and he roughly snatched the wrong dish away and stalked back to the kitchen.  He did end up bringing the correct order, but the sharp looks he kept giving me every time he came back to the table to refill our drinks could have wilted flowers. By this time, we just wanted to finish our dinner and GTFO.  That said, the food we did have was pretty good. The Murgh Tikka was tender and sizzly, and the Mattar Paneer had generous chunks of cheese and was nicely creamy.   Who knows, maybe the server was just having a bad day. Ultimately, although the food was okay, the dining experience was uncomfortable and definitely left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"Best of everything I've tasted from nun bread to butter chicken to rice buryani. The only thing is the damn wait and me I rarely wait for food"}
{"text":"Staple indian food that is not overly spicy-hot."}
{"text":"Walking along Queen Street, I was looking for some Indian food to eat. Trimurti is located on a block surrounded by 3 other Indian restaurants. I figured I'd try here because of the cheaper prices and extensive vegetarian selection.   It was a good choice going here, the food is delicious. I was with 2 others, and we all ordered vegetarian items, all of which were good. You choose a curry, and order rice or naan on the side if you choose. The food is quite filling, so you might have some food leftover to take home. Before your food is brought to you, a server brings some pappadums with various sauces to snack on. Being a student in the city, I'd probably go here often to order something to eat.   Service is a bit slow, but it's worth the wait if you have the time."}
{"text":"My son and I are in Toronto and decided to try some of the local (and abundant) Indian food. The hotel clerk who was a British expat recommended Trimurti. Since there is great Indian food in London we figured he would know what he was talking about. It was very, very good. We live in So. Cal where there is a lot of authentic Indian so we've eaten at dozens of different Indian places. This one is definitely in the top 20%. Murgh Tikka Misala was nice and flavorful with thick, hot orange gravy. Big pieces of chicken cooked perfectly in the tandoori oven! The Naan was hot, crunchy on the bottom and tender on the top. The Basmati rice was delicious and topped with something crunchy and yummy. The Aloo Gobi was good but would have preferred more potatoes and a few more tomotoes/peppers and a bit less cauliflower. My son liked it so much he wants to go back again today."}
{"text":"Last Friday a few friends and I had dinner at Trimurti, and I was pleasantly surprised, so I'm bumping up the rating by 1 star.  We ordered a selection of dishes:  boti kebab - Tandoori lamb pieces, spiced the right amount and tender mutter paneer, ho-hum... not very flavourful alu gobi - crisp, fresh cauliflower, balanced spicing butter chicken - okay, nothing special  The naan was actually a little disappointing, since it was practically crispy throughout.  So, dinner fare here is definitely better than the buffet. I would probably come again if I were in the area and hankering for Indian food. It's a little less expensive than competitor, Babur."}
{"text":"I am finally reviewing Trimurti after eating there several times in the past year. I absolutely love their chicken biryani (yes, there is more to Indian food than butter chicken). They manage to get a lot of flavour in their dishes unlike some other Indian restaurants in the city. I have gone in for their lunch buffet a few times and the food has been finger licking delicious every time. I have also taken my coworkers, friends many times and they all seem to like it.   They have a really good buffet menu with a lot of meat/seafood options...goat curry (hard to get in GTA), shrimp or fish curry, chicken tandoori and of course the butter chicken. They also have the biryani sometimes in the buffet. The desserts are also nice with mostly fresh fruits, Gulab Jamun, ice creams which most people seem to miss as they are located opposite to the buffet station. They have a few western desserts too.   The owner is quite friendly and the service is not bad. The place can get busy on weekends so be sure to call in for reservations. Try this place, you won't be disappointed as this is the best Indian lunch buffet I could find in Toronto."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but this was the worst indian food I've ever eaten. My friend and I ate there for an early dinner and about ten minutes after we ordered she received her food but we were waiting awkwardly for my vegetable korma for about forty minutes. The vegetable korma was awful and I ended up leaving almost all of it behind. The veggies were clearly from a frozen mix and the sauce was not properly flavoured."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent but, unfortunately, the food is mediocre. I find it bland in comparison to the offerings at Little India just two doors over.   The service at Little India is hit or miss, but it's the most consistently good food on the Indian Mile here on Queen."}
{"text":"There are four indian places on the block, this one has the best meat dishes, like tandoori  chicken, butter chicken, etc.   Service is adequate for the price. Buriyani rice, eggplant bharta, indian breads are great. Can be hard to get a table on Thursday/Friday for lunch."}
{"text":"Lackluster lunch buffet and poor service make this one a skip for me. The ugly decor and tight spaces don't help, either."}
{"text":"Skip this. Go to India Palace or Little India next door. Trimurti specializes in Bombay style cuisine i.e. orange butter chicken. And if you've ever read my reviews about Indian Restaurants, the real butter chicken is always more red (in color) and mildly sweeter - Delhi style!   A little bit about the restaurant:  The layout of this place is very similar to the ones on this strip. The manager/owner did claim that everyone was copying Trimurti. He was a chatty one; the server, on the other hand, was the usual unsmiling Indian staff - as my boyfriend noted.   We ordered - and mind you, we aren't creative - naan bread, white basmati rice and butter chicken. The rice and naan were fantastic. The butter chicken was mediocre. And spicy. It was better than most places, but trust the Indian chick who's lived in Delhi (points at self) when she says there are better options 2 doors away from this place.   Verdict? Not coming back."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Delicious Indian food!  Favourite dishes: baingan ka bharta (eggplant w tomatoes) and naan bread  My experience: I've been going here for a bit over 4 years and love it. The interior is not fancy at all, so don't take a date you are trying to impress. But if you are with a friend or a date you already impressed, and just want good Indian food which is not too wild and delicious then come here.  Buffet: I've never been here for a buffet, and prefer the regular menu.  Recommended order: I think it's best to take two different dishes (i.e. meat and vegetarian) a bowl or rice and naan -- it's a perfect meal for two. I also always take chai, to tame some of the spiciness. If you are choosing meat try their lamb it is superb.  They also deliver.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was refreshing and inviting, while the food was exquisite. Everyone in our party was more than satisfied with the dishes they ordered, and the portions were just right. The naan bread was to die for! Best Indian food I've had in years."}
{"text":"I ate at Trumurta last night, I'm a fan!  I travel a lot on business and often eat alone, as I did last night. Some places seem to like to treat a solo diner as a nuisance or a social misfit, but not here. I got a nice table (not \"the\" one by the bathroom or the kitchen door, which is not unusual), plenty of room for my book and my Blackberry, and no probem.  I had the chickpea/cottage cheese kebab appetizer, chicken madras, daal tarka, a paratha, pilau rice and the obligatory Kingfisher. The food was all good, the madras really nice and spicy, with an unusual hint of coconut milk in the sauce.  It took me some time to plough through the generous portions, the place was busy but at no time did I feel hassled to give up my table (a single diner\" experience which is not unusual). Excellent service, the popadum and pickles came out right away without having to ask for them, and my water glass was never empty.  By the time I'd managed to stuff myself to the brim and still had food left over, the restaurant was full and buzzing, but the wait staff never seemed to leave anyone hanging for anything.  I wish this place was round the corner from my home in LA, I'd be back every week."}
{"text":"Not that good most of the good was finished and to be honest the food was not that good  But if your in the mood for Indian food that's cheep & ok the Sunday buffet is ok"}
{"text":"This place is really, really good. Hands-down my first choice for Indian food in the area. The staff are extremely friendly, and will be happy to recommend you their favourite dishes on the menu. Food is fast, fresh, filling, and delicious! Cozy atmosphere, great location, and great prices. For once I'm not really sure what else to add, because they're doing everything right and I keep coming back.  Get the garlic naan to go with whatever you order, its delicious. I really enjoy the Chicken Jalfrezi as well as the Chicken Bharta. My wife enjoys the various paneers, though I can't remember which specific ones.  Another bonus is the little gold trays of sauces that you put on this dry nacho-like bread (I'm likely butchering the description of a very common Indian food here) which is included with every meal to snack on while you wait. Come here, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place for lunch buffet, so I dropped by here for that! Before, the price was $11.95, now it is $12.95.   Food: Selection is very limited, There were a 4 different types of curry, samosas, fried fish, meat and chicken with spices, two different types of rice, and vegetables with spices. Overall, the food was dry, some tasted like they've been sitting there for a while.   There was a small selection of desserts- pieces of cake, fruits, Indian sweets. The cake was soft and yummy. However, the fruits tasted old.   Service: Mediocre. A young man brought me water, brought naan halfway through my meal (they were thin and flaky, so good!) then took away the finished plates towards the end of my meal.  The total came up to be around $15 (excluding tip).  I would not be back for lunch, but maybe I'll give this place a try for dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, but I wouldn't say it matches the restaurants in Mississauga. Indian cuisine in Toronto surprisingly lacks imagination and kick. This place was pretty packed for a Tuesday night, so I realized it must be a local favourite.   There were quite a few lone diners present when I went, Kingfishers in hand :) I had the vegetable jalfrezi, and asked the waiter to make it spicy (a request which was sadly, unfulfilled). The portions were sizeable, and the food was rich, and very good- just not spicy enough for my liking. The naan and roti are yum. There was a little bit of a delay in making the roti, and the waiter apologized multiple times for that. Three stars for the food, and +1 for the great service. A good go-to place for flavourful, wholesome Indian food."}
{"text":"Buffet pretty good. Reasonable selection. Service not great. But for a fast solid lunch not bad"}
{"text":"Solid, good value, dependable Indian food with friendly and reliable service.   This is our local Indian place--we've only ever had takeout but we'll really have to go in and have a meal there one day. The guys on the phone have without fail been prompt, polite, friendly and honest. I don't know why it's so important to me, but I hate it when I pick up the phone to order takeout and the person on the other end is rude, rushed, or they lie to you about how long it'll take to get your goodies. (And it's never taken us longer than half an hour to get our food delivered, even on a Friday night.)  These guys really know how to do customer service. And they'll accommodate you--I recently ordered a shrimp dish and let them know since I was pregnant I needed the shrimp very well cooked. The dude on the phone was very understanding, but he did try to warn me that \"Of course you know if you cook the shrimp too long they become tough\"... I was impressed that the guy taking the order was so knowledgeable about the cooking! In the end, my shrimp were perfectly cooked through and not tough either. Way to go Trimurti!  Naan here is delicious, as others have mentioned; but the real test for me of any Indian resto is their gulab jamun. This is an Indian sweet: it's small balls of dough (kind of like Indian Timbits, if that's not an offensive comparison) in a rosewater scented syrup. Trimurti's were perfection: tender, not tough, and in a light, not a sickly-sweet syrup. Almost as good as my Mum's."}
{"text":"Definitely good Indian food. My girlfriend and I were in from out of town (and country for that matter). I brought up the idea of having Indian food for dinner and we happened upon this block. I don't think it was our actual destination but were lured in by the waiter that had assertively come outside to tell us that we'd reached our destination.  We ordered 2 appetizers (veggie samosas & pakoras), 2 entrees (chickpea masala & lamb madras) and even an order of biryani and naan to accompany the meal. We were pleasantly surprised with how absurdly cheap it ended up being. Somewhere in the neighborhood of $30-35 for everything mentioned even after the tax.  The food was very delicious and the service was adequate, though not excessively attentive which was fine."}
{"text":"We got a table before the restaurant filled up for dinner, placed our order and waited.  And waited.  And then had to flag down a waiter to check on our order, which included appetizers which had not appeared.  He said there had been some mistake, which we (correctly) assumed meant none of our order had been placed.  They were sincerely apologetic (or this would be a 1 star review), but did not otherwise compensate us for the 30+ extra minutes we sat there with empty water glasses and no appetizers."}
{"text":"Growing up in the wilds of Thornhill, I was a relative latecomer to the world of Indian cuisine. My palate had toured most of Asia (in varying degrees of authenticity), but Indian food had yet to find a solid footing that far North. Venturing downtown for undergrad, I was able to better explore my city, in all it's colours, creeds and flavours.   Trimurti represented one of my earliest ventures into Subcontinental cuisine, on the strength of a review of it's Butter Chicken by Jacob Richler, then of the National Post and still of the much more talented father. I was curious about this exotic dish; which started with a tenderized, roasted bird and ended with the sweet and subtle balance between tomato and cream.   I'll say it now. Butter chicken is a gateway drug. Trimurti's version is all tender tandoori'd bird bathed in luxuriant sauce, a fine balance of acid and dairy, smoothed further with a restrained sweetness I have yet to find elsewhere. It's worth a trip in it's own right.   Yes, they sell soup and salad. No, I've never seen anybody order them, even from the well-stocked lunch buffet. Better to go with the deep-fried family of appetizers. Flaky egetarian samosas contain spicy well-cooked potatoes and pop with bright grean peas. Onion Bhajas are what happens when your garden variety onion ring answers the cumin-cardamom call of Cthulu. I don't know what's in the pakoras, and I don't really care. They are crispy, greasy marvels.   Lamb Rogan Josh is stewed to falling-apart tenderness; spicy enough, though my inner Johnny Knoxville wishes for more blistering heat. Biryanis are decent, but if you're looking to conserve carbs, delightful naan are buttery, puffy brilliance.   I would argue that the most important part of Indian cuisine is the prevalence of vegetables. For those looking to go a day or two a week without meat, Trimurti's vegetable dishes would be a great start. Daal is well-flavoured and hefty; channa masala chickpeas yield creamy protein-starchy goodness; eggplant bartha is stewed to meaty depths of flavour, and saag paneer is a subcontinental improvement on the steakhouse favourite, creamed spinach. Portions seem small for the price (and most are available on the buffet for a better lunch value), but it's all so filling you won't have room for more.    Service is friendly, but sometimes feels undertrained. Plates are cleared at random intervals, and the cheque arrives un-asked for.   Boo for their ever-shifting delivery boundaries. When I crave curry in a hurry, this is the place I crave. Depending on who picks up the phone, sometimes they'll come through, some times they won't.  My university days are long past, but I still have a taste for Trimurti. On those rare occasions I find myself lingering around the former home of CityTV, I still pop in for a bite."}
{"text":"One of the best and most affordable Indian restaurants. They have one of the best garlic naans in the city. Their saag paneer and butter chicken are mouth-watering and delicious. I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The good:  The meat and vegetarian selection is good and the price for the buffet isn't bad either.  The bad:   The food is too salty. I think that all of their dishes would taste good if they dialled down on the salt. I love Indian food, and this isn't the typical well-seasoned level of salt. I think they're overdoing it on the MSG. The saag paneer was so disappointing because of this. The paneer itself had a brat texture and I am guessing was made in house, but there was so much salt in the spinach that I couldn't eat it all - and I really wanted saag paneer!! Everything was very salty - and I am someone who typically loves salty food but this was wayyyy too much.   The service isn't great. We don't eat very quickly, and we didn't go up to the buffet many times, but we had our dirty plates piling up on the table. The restaurant was not busy when we went, so I don't see why they would let us sit there for 10 minutes before bothering to clean the plates. They also don't bother to refill your water glass unless you ask - and with all the salt you'll need water refills!"}
{"text":"These people have good authentic food. Not the fantastic \"OMG, I just died' variety, but solidly good. Their madras curry & butter chicken are delicious. Their lunch buffet was also good value for money.  I order often from here. We've never been disappointed, though I don't necessarily like their kebabs and tandoori - on the dry side, even though it's well flavoured. But curry, vegetables and roti - very good food.  It's a simple place with basic decor and layout."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, Trimurti. I love you because you are the basis of a strange joke I have with my best friend. But I love you more because your restaurant is not a joke, it is a seriously delicious Indian restaurant that I would like to eat at everyday in the winter (For some reason I can't eat Indian in the summer, which is strange because in India it's always summer and they eat this stuff everyday.).   Trimurti is probably the nicest looking of the three Indian restaurants in this strip -- they have a classy exterior and an interior that is just as nice. The decor is typical of an Indian restaurant, but a little more upscale in their choice of dishes and linens.  Sadly, I have not been here for the lunch buffet yet, but every dinner I've had here has been enjoyable. I am not an expert on Indian cuisine by any means, but I definitely loved their naan and butter chicken, and their samosas and onion bhajias were so so good. Prices are average for this kind of place, with veggie dishes being cheaper than a beef or lamb dish. I've never had a problem with the staff  -- there were a couple times I could have used more water refills, especially since my mouth is usually on fire, but besides that, they were very attentive and efficient.  If you have to pick one of the Indian places on Queen, I'd say pick Trimurti, but it can get busy on weekends, so arrive early or make reservations."}
{"text":"I travel to Toronto quite often for business, and when I'm in the mood for moderately-priced Indian food for lunch, this is my go-to place.  It can be quite crowded for lunch, so make sure you show up just at the right time - too early and the buffet isn't quite ready yet. Too late and... well you know how buffets will go near closing time.   Is it really closed now? I haven't been back to Toronto in a few months."}
{"text":"The food here is very, very good. I definitely agree with the review that mentioned how fresh their Nan bread is. The atmosphere is cozy and the service we got was pleasant and attentive without being intrusive. For dinner I had the Gosht Rogan Josh Lamb with some extra spice requested - the portion size was decent and the quality of the meat was great (not fatty and chewy). We also ordered the Tarka Dal which was very nicely flavoured with a very subtle smokiness. If you are crawling along Queen St. you will pass a few other Indian options but this one is definitely worth a visit."}
