{"text":"New and nice small restaurant! Thai curry with a lot of herb and spices. The green curry and tamarind curry is so good!! I got it with coconut sticky rice and grilled chicken.I would like to try more food. Nice service and atmosphere. I will go back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Highly recommended for a quick bite in the Kensington area. Curry Love serves a unique twist on the Thai food that I'm used to. Its sort of like if Urban Herbivore was a Thai restaurant. It's counter service so the way it works is you choose your base (noodle, rice, etc.) your protein (beef, chicken, tofu, etc.), a curry (several to choose from - I got the peanut curry!) and then you can top with lots of veggies, fruits (pineapple, mango) and herbs. So pleased with it. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Portions are not that big but it's understandable if you think about the price. Wish they put more curries on their meals but oh well.. Honestly, I'd give the food alone 3 stars but as a graduate of U of T, I'm adding one more star because I can see my fellow U of T students trying them out for a quick bite and the quality seemed quite fresh. Try this place out. This place might put your stressful university life with unhealthy meals near the area into oblivion."}
{"text":"Great little spot with excellent curry. Delicious vegetarian/vegan options available. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! Curry Love is a nice little hidden gem. The service was incredible... The gentleman behind the counter was insanely kind and let us try every single type of curry available. I ended up going with 1/2 tamarind curry (a must-try), 1/2 yellow curry on vermicelli noodles, with a combination of all the available toppings (the gentleman was more than happy to do that for me!). We ended up eating in the little shop, and the servers voluntarily gave us glasses of water which was really nice. The curry flavour was delicious, & toppings complemented the noodles perfectly. It was a great quick meal."}
{"text":"I had the fried pork with thick curry and various toppings and my friend had the fried pork with yellow curry.   Even though the yellow curry is labelled as 2.5x spice, it was almost mild, and my thick currier was spicier.   I felt like there wasn't enough curry for the amount of rice. They poured the curry over the rice, but the rice on the bottom didn't even get touched by curry. The curry was pretty good though.  There were a wide variety of toppings. I really liked the fried onion."}
{"text":"Curry Love is absolutely one of my top 5 places to eat in Toronto. I had friends visiting from Paris and this was the first stop I had for them. My colleagues and I frequent this place often and if I ever have a craving for Thai food this is my first thought. The food is delicious, wonderfully spiced and IT IS TASTE SO AUTHENTIC! My current fav is a mix of green curry and thick curry with roti. Ah I can't get enough. I'm of asian decent and often miss my mom's home cooking (she lives in Indiana). This is my quick fix back to happiness. Thanks Curry Love and see you super soon.... maybe tomorrow :P."}
{"text":"Just east of Bathurst on College. Had the lunch special of garlic chicken with broccoli, carrots and basil on rice. It comes with a drink or spring roll. The flavour isn't very strong. The veggies are nice and the chicken tastes delicious, butthe overall flavour was not enough. I added soya, chilli and some of the other sauces. I would like to go back and try the curries, hopefully they are spicier.  The shop is nice and small with 4-5 places to sit. You can charge your phone and use the wifi. The servers are nice and the place overall is good.  The restaurant is a 5/5, the food is  3/5. Worth trying out if you eat in."}
{"text":"Pretty Great food! I've walked by this place a bunch of times, and have always been curious about checking it out. Glad I finally did :) As soon as I walked in, I loved the place. I was greeted with incredibly friendly service, and the person working (I think owner?) was so nice, that even though the lunch special had passed, he gave it to me since the sign wasn't yet changed. I got the pad Thai which was very tasty, but the service and friendly demeanor will also have me coming back :) Glad I finally checked it out."}
{"text":"Great taste and service. I would give more than five if I could The curry sauce are delicious! My favorite are green and yellow curry. Thai lunch dishes are awesome as well. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Cheap and tasty! I love that you can get to pick what kind of ingredients you would want. What kind of rice you want like Jasmine, white, brown. Also I enjoy the taste of the flavor They even made me try out the curry sauces. I ended up mine no meat and veggies. You can  also add on corn and other ones I can't remember for a buck fifty. The whole thing cost me only $12. Yumm"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The owners were very warm and friendly and everything tasted really fresh! You really get alot of food for the price! Its amazing value! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Deliciously convenient and customizable. Choose your starch, sauce, protein, and a variety of other toppings (veggies galoree)  I got the green curry w/ salad + chicken and a red curry w/ rice + beef. Plus, all the toppings. Chickpeazzz in ma curry! Thai awesomeness on a salad! Wewt!!!  I found the flavours to be gentle, not overly oily (huge +), and very very fresh. Neither of the curries were very spicy but, for context, I prolly have built a tolerance for this :).   Get 1 with a salad base and 1 with a starchy base for maximum happiness. Curry Love does pack in a lot of rice per box but it's the perfect amount to split between two.   Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for take out, very friendly owners and delicious food. Highly recommended for cheap and healthy meal."}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating staff (samples, etc). Overall the quality of food was average."}
{"text":"We recently tried Curry Love for the first time via UberEATS delivery. We got mango salad, yellow curry chicken, green curry chicken, yellow curry tofu, and red curry shrimp. Everything was fresh and delicious, and we loved that there are a million different toppings to choose from. The stand out dish for us was definitely the yellow curry chicken. That went first, followed closely by the green curry chicken. We also loved that you can get brown rice, which added more flavour and crunch in addition to being more healthy. The one drawback here, as other reviews have mentioned, is that they need to give you more stuff for the amount of rice. The amount of rice is very good, but you need more curry to make the proportions right. It would be a mistake to fix this by reducing the amount of rice - that would make it not enough food. Overall very good and I'm happy to have this in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"First off.. I do not want to give this store less than 5 stars because they do deserve their ratings based on the quality level of service and we all know how hard it is for new restaurants to start off on the right foot.   With that said however, there are some things that I feel that needs to be improved before going forward. We got the opportunity to try out all of the curry before ordering which was a great touch. The tamarind curry was super delicious when we tried on the spoon but after putting it over the jasmine rice and walking for 10 minutes to eat, we found most of it dried up and soaked into the rice :(. maybe it's been watered down?   I'm not too sure why that happened but I think it would be better if it was to be separated from the rice when storing it. I don't believe the store meant to skimp out on materials since there was a fair portion of meat (both chicken and beef tasted fantastic- great savoury taste).   I felt curry love did a great job on providing lots of garnishes with your meal! There are many ways to customize your meal and tons of hot sauces and fish sauces you can add to your order. Who knew pineapples with curry would taste good?! The jungle curry also had a good kick.   Overall I would recommend curry love. Please take my 5 star rating this time but I will be back again to give a more formal review next time. I really want to love this place!"}
{"text":"I give it 4 star rating for the service and friendliness.  The two working there are smiles from the moment you walk in.  Very friendly and nice.  I got to sample a few different curry flavours prior to selecting which one is my fav.  I ordered the Thick Curry Chicken with Brown Rice and the toppings I added were Broccoli, Carrots and Edamame.  Now the all honesty, the Thick Curry sauce is very nice - peanut sauce.  I would normally have the red curry but wanted to try something different since its my first time at Curry Love.  Lots of rice. A few pieces of chicken but enough for me.  4 pieces of broccoli and 4 pieces of carrots and a spoon full of edamame.  That, to me, is a tease.  I would prefer to see a bit more vegetables with my chicken rather than half the container filled with rice.  I would try this place again just to give business for the friendly people working there or owners."}
{"text":"Tried a few things on the menu during the 50% off opening special and I was pleasantly surprised. The place is very clean and the staff were very patient with all the questions being asked. It's nice and healthy (the veggies sides are all raw or steamed, and the bases include choices like brown rice and green salad) with a good array of options for the base and proteins. The jungle curry is apparently extremely spicy but I unfortunately didn't get a chance to try it - the others (even the 2 chili ones) aren't hot at all to me. IMO the red & the tamarind curries are the best. I think there needs to be a bit more sauce on the rice than is currently given (not sure if this is just during the opening/discount phase), but it was still very tasty."}
{"text":"We had been watching as the place renovated what was a small greek place that never really opened before closing last year. The new place located on the north side of the street between Borden and Brunswick is called Curry Love and features a selection of Thai inspired curries. A small place with the cash located at the front and a service counter than runs down the length of one wall. The place has a simple, clean style with lots of cooking pots providing decoration on the wall behind the counter.   Like a lot of other quick serve places you choose your base, a selection of rice or roti, then your protein, a choice of curries (green, yellow, red, thick and tamarind) and then dress that with a selection of available toppings. It is a really good idea and I am hoping it will be quite popular because we were happy with everything that we ordered. I had a roti with shrimp, which while small were really tasty, the thick (peanut) curry with cilantro, basil, carrots and onions. Mr.T opted for some jasmine rice, beef, red curry and most of their toppings. Everything is placed in recyclable containers for take away because there is only one small counter that seats two at best for eating in situ. Because it is a soft opening they are still working out the kinks but I have to say the place has a nice atmosphere and really friendly service and the food was yummy. I would love to see the carrots and cucumbers sliced more matchstick style and maybe some chopped peanuts and bean sprouts added to the available toppings. I am definitely a fan of the concept and their food."}
{"text":"Really liked the concept of a chipotle style Thai restaurant. This restaurant is run by a couple who moved to Toronto from Thailand. We were able to select our side, meat, curry, and toppings. The owner let us taste each of their curries which I thought was very nice. All the curries were divers in their flavours and refreshing for our senses.We were here for lunch and they were running lunch specials that included a spring roll/ drink with our curry for 7.95 Canadian. We would definitely recommend anyone in the area to give this a shot!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, simple menu, really friendly service. Both me and a co-worker stopped in and got quick and tasty food. Would totally come back"}
