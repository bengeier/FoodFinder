{"text":"I have been here a few times with an okay experience.  Today I ordered 35.00 worth of food for 2 people and toddler.  One order was flat wrong and needed 2 sausage patties added to the plate.  I kindly pointed the mistake out.  Pointed to the menu which supported my claim and she declined to make it right.  The person behind me then told her she was wrong and she correct my order.  I left and went back to eat my food with no resolution to the issue.  Then the front desk girl brought out the carbon copy and told me why I was wrong while my two year old is having a meltdown.  I then told her I didn't want to Argue and asked her to leave.   5 min later as we left the sausage showed up and no boxes ( requested 2 times) were brought to our table.  Go to crema and support good service and food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for burger - one of the best in town and always made correctly to order. Today I took the family and we tried pot roast (fall-off-the-fork tender), the fish (light breading practically floated off the plate) and the fresh batter cheese curd (amazing). For an order-at-the-counter place, $53 seems a bit pricy for lunch for four. Still, great food, great service, and great atmosphere every time is worth paying extra."}
{"text":"Great fast and affordable breakfast loved the edible fresh fruit garnish too. Clean and friendly establishment, walk up ordering and table delivered. Worth the visit"}
{"text":"The staff didn't even know what the ingredients where in the different flavored mayo sauces for sandwiches. The manager on duty had to be called to be asked about the dairy in the black bean burger, and even she didn't know that eggs are not a dairy product. The fries? What truffle oil is supposed to do besides cost more, I have no idea. They tasted like ordinary fries to me. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"I've pasted this place everyday to work for over 2 months and finally being on my vacation I made it a note to stop. The simple menu gave me some comfort I found what I wanted with in seconds. I paid up front sat done and in about 15 minutes I had my food. 

The service was just what i wanted, close but knew when they were need. For the price I've never felt so full. Hidden back on Broadway is a treasure of a cafe."}
{"text":"This is a charming restaurant with delicious food! Get their CC Original Burger and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We had Cranberry Creek Catering for our wedding this July and overall we were satisfied with everything.  Communication was very good, Jim was always quick to return calls and spend time answering questions for us.  The tasting at the cafe was delicious and was the main reason we picked Cranberry Creek for catering.  We chose the Pot Roast and the Cranberry Chicken and everyone was telling us how much they loved it.  They delivered to our reception about an hour away and provided everything including cutting our cake after we did the traditional thing for photos.  Just remember to tell them if you want someone to stay or serve at the event otherwise they'll setup everything then leave and return when you want them to.  The plates were nice, linens were clean, delivery was smooth, food was hot, tasty and plentiful and pickup was quick.  Delivery guy earned a nice tip for taking the time to congratulate us, ask us how the food was and offering to pack up the leftovers."}
{"text":"Cranberry Creek catered our wedding last September. They were polite and helpful throughout the process. They answered our questions promptly and charged reasonable prices. They were patient with my questions regarding the specifics of ingredients (for guests with food allergies). The food was great, and the service at our wedding was prompt and professional."}
{"text":"Great little gem!

Remember MacDowell's from \"Coming to America?\" This is the Panera Bread version of that. It looks like a Panera, has great food like a Panera, but isn't a corporate conglomerate. Win-win!

The Cranberry Chicken was excellent, though the twice-baked potatoes were far too chivey for my tastes. Staff was friendly and efficient, and the bakery is great, too!

I don't get to Madison very often, but I would definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"I've only had a small sampling of the items on their menu, but what I've had is delicious. So tasty in fact, that as often as I go back I'm afraid to try something new because I love my regular order so much.

I usually build my own burger with a beef patty and house sauce (plus the usual lettuce, tomato, red onion, spinach). This isn't a fast food place so you actually get to specify how you want the patty cooked as well, plus your choice of bun. The burger is super juicy, the bun sound, and the sauce complements it all perfectly. 

The burger comes with an order of the truffle fries, which are in the running for the best fries I've ever had. I usually order a bottle of Sprecher root beer to wash it down, to complete what is usually the best meal of my week.

You can get it to go if you want, I've always gotten my order in less than ten minutes, but if you have time to eat in it's definitely worth it too. The atmosphere is super cozy, replete with spacious booths and cushy lounge chairs surrounding a fire place, almost like a good-coffee shop vibe, but without the need to fight for a seat.

Keep it up folks!"}
{"text":"Strange place with moderately passable food.  The truffles fries are heavy on truffle oil and too oily for my taste.  Other things I've tried there have been consistently underwhelming for the cost."}
{"text":"Awesome food with great prices. The atmosphere is very welcoming for all ages and there is food for even the pickiest of eaters. Make sure to get the cranberry butter and save room for dessert! They are also a great option to have for catering for any size of group."}
{"text":"My wife and I first went here with a Bucky Book coupon. Every time we've been here the food has never disappointed. Don't know how they do it, but it's pretty amazing. I've tried many burgers, including the black bean burger. My wife likes breakfast and their dinners. You'll leave stuffed and happy.

We also happened to be getting married. Conveniently, they had catering menus. We made an appointment with Jim who sat down with us and told us exactly what we could expect with all of the different options. We should have purchased the cake cutting service they offer - on the day of the wedding we forgot to grab cake cutting utensils. Luckily we had a clutch last minute savior bring us what we needed. Cutting the cake is a mess and not something to be trifled with when you're all dressed up.

The catering was great! They arrived right on time to the public shelter we rented for the day. Our family and friends all had kind things to say about the food we ordered. The baked cod was more popular than the chicken, most likely because our wedding guests didn't want to pick through bones while they were dressed up. It was still tasty and nobody left hungry!

For a solo meal or a catered one, don't miss your chance at this place!"}
{"text":"Extremely inconsistent.  One weekend I go for brunch and everything is delicious and perfect.  The next week, I get icy cold English Muffin and nearly burnt scrambled eggs.  My friends burger was raw, not rare but really raw in the middle, as in purple/red meat.  Other times, everything has been great.  Just never sure what I'm going to get when I come here, which is why I don't come here a lot anymore."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Counter service is a plus for me. If you're one to have trouble deciding, the CC original burger might be the best burger in Madison. Love the truffle fries too!"}
{"text":"Lunch with a co-worker. Fast casual atmosphere without the chain restaurant feel. Lots of different menu options, however they specialize in burgers which you wouldnt expect from the name. Order at the counter, then they bring it to the table. The only slight was that it was quite loud over lunch time, as i hard a hard time hearing and talking woth my tablemate."}
{"text":"I took my family here for breakfast.  It's not too far from us and I had passed it several times thinking we should try it or.  It's a sit down restaurant that you place your order at the counter for, at least in the morning we did.  I did not mind this because we could walk in and place the order then go find our seat as opposed to waiting to have someone come and take our drink then our food order, time matters with 3 kids.  The food options were good, the prices were very responsible compared to others in the area that can break the bank.  They are a little secluded, the entrance is off a side road."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem! Every time I go there I always have exceptional service and the food is always hot and fresh. My favorite things to order are the BBQ Bacon Burger with amazingly delicious truffle fries and the mac and cheese! :) Whenever I am in the area I love stopping here for lunch because of the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was in Madison with a co-worker and he knew I loved to dine out, so he suggested this restaurant for lunch. The menu was large and there were a lot of great looking items, but I decided I wanted to try the truffle fries. Therefore, my entree had to be a burger. That's just how I roll.

I built my own burger with mushrooms and bacon. The burger patty was cooked perfectly, juicy and delicious. The burger to bun ratio was a perfect balance.

The true star was the truffle fries. I've had truffle fries before, but none as good as these. The potatoes were fresh cut and topped generously with the truffle oil. Then they were served in an individual sized deep-fryer basket for a cool presentation. 

It looked like a franchise chain, but I don't think it is, so I like it even more!

I hope to make it back to Cranberry Creek soon when I get back to Madison and try more of the menu.

Todd S. may have been looking at the Cranberry Creek in Stevens Point, which is closed. The Madison location is still open. I called them just now to make sure."}
{"text":"It's like eating at home, but you have to wear pants.

The decor is very comfy and cozy and the food makes you all warm inside.

What I've tried:
build your own burger- Endless possibilities! Your dream burger awaits you... The veggie burger here is awesome!

Portobello provolone panini- I love a hot sandwich on good bread. and the bread is good

Truffle fries- I'm not classy enough to really know what a truffle tastes like, but these fries are damn good.

Word to the wise, the Cranberry Creek house sauce does not contain cranberries. A memeber of my lunch group was very dissapointed by this and I would hate for anyone else to suffer the same fate."}
{"text":"I've seen the sign for this place on the Beltline for years, but have never actually ventured along that part of Monona Drive until recently. My boyfriend had noticed it on a drive one day and wanted to try it one morning of his vacation, so I met him and we rolled on over. 

When we walked in, I was surprised to see that it was counter service. I am the absolute worst decider at a new place, so that kind of threw me for a loop because I hate to be that person that makes the counterperson stand there awkwardly while I make a choice. Usually I research things ahead of time, but for this I had failed.

Gratefully there was no one behind me, and after several excruciating minutes (and a wonderfully sweet and patient cashier/our eventual server) I landed on panic pancakes. Panic because too many things sounded good and I just pulled the trigger. I specifically got the cranberry pancakes - I love cranberries, the restaurant is named after them, it would presumably be a good choice. Pancakes usually fall to the bottom of my list, though, so when I sat down at our booth to wait I started having buyer's remorse. 

Happy to report there was no need for that - they were amazing. Some of the best pancakes I've ever had, actually - my guess is that they were made from scratch instead of with a mix. The cranberry flavor was subtle, but present, and made even better by the cranberry butter it was served with. Cranberry butter! I am a weirdo who skips over maple syrup, so this was a perfect accompaniment. For my side, I chose the rustic red potatoes - well seasoned, and cooked all the way through. 

The restaurant only had a couple other patrons on a weekday morning, but that was fine by me - nice and quiet. The interior was really cozy with a huge fireplace that serves as the focal point of the dining area. The cashier/server was fantastic, checking in enough that we had everything we needed, but not interrupting our meal. With my flexible work schedule, I'm excited to hit them up on another weekday morning."}
{"text":"My plate is almost cleaned off!!The food and atmosphere are always so good!! This is a weekend eatery for family or a great place to have lunch and talk business during the week!! We have never had a bad meal here in 4 years!! Great service and great food!!"}
{"text":"We have been a fan of Cranberry Creek for a few years now.  Though we don't frequent the cafe, we do find ourselves wandering into the area from time to time.  Every single visit has ended with us talking about how good the food was.  Whether it's burgers, salads, eggs, or pancakes, there appears to be no bad choice on the menu.  

\"And the fifth star?\" I can hear you asking about it from my living room.  The service is hit-or-miss.  Examples.  Today was great. A+ even.  All of the employees were chipper and happy to serve us, their customers.  In the past (a month ago or so) the same staff has hurried us along so they could close.  I'm sorry but if we come in an hour before closing and it takes 40 minutes to get two burgers, we are going to take our time.  Please don't ask to take my plate if I am still eating. Not good. D (at best).  

I am willing to balance this all out because the food is so good and the \"A+\" experiences outweigh the \"D\" times.  And because kids get a free Mickey pancake on the weekends. (If you're lucky, the little one won't finish it all and you can get in on that action.)"}
{"text":"I was always a Kabul gal when I made my frequent trips to Madison, and still am, but then i found out that Cranberry Creek earns airmiles from American Airlines (or at least they did when I was there, I've been gone since 2009). 

It also looks as if they've removed my favorite dish from the menu, which I checked before posting. It was a pasta dish with a lemon type sauce, served with fresh broccoli. Plus, it seems as if they had delicious rolls alongside. Everything was always hot, fresh, and really good. 

I usually came on late Saturday afternoon/early evenings when there was almost no traffic at all. If they were available, I'd often grab a cranberry muffin for the road, as I always had to head home to Milwaukee right after. 

I'll still come visit when I'm in town, but I will miss my pasta. I'll have to figure out something else to order."}
{"text":"We happened upon the restaurant because it was off the highway with outdoor seating that allowed pets. Our orders include an A1 burger with fries, Fish and Chips, and a Reuben with fries. We also got an order of fried pickles. We all loved our food and were impressed with the portions as well as the quality. If I lived in the area I would return!"}
{"text":"I like the casual ambience a lot. It's very cozy. I've had a few things, and the burger was my favorite. Tilapia dinner I do not recommend. Decent prices and Nice portions though. Business hours limited."}
{"text":"I frequently come here for lunch. It's a very homey and cozy atmosphere. I always get a half sandwich or salad with soup. I'm crazy about their spicy chicken panini. The French onion soup is also very tasty. The service is always very nice. It's nothing fancy, but it's a solid lunch choice.

Update: I've just recently tried their burger and truffle fries. Absolutely delicious. Truffle fries are to die for."}
{"text":"Our daughter had her wedding yesterday and Cranberry Creek did the catering. The food was excellent. We had BBQ chicken and ribs, salad, a scalloped potato and dinner rolls; every guest was extremely happy with the food and had plenty to eat. Jim and the rest of the servers were great and went out of their way to make sure everyone was taken care of. I would highly recommend Cranberry Creek for any catering event!"}
{"text":":::This review is for the catering:::

We order Cran Creek often at work. The quality of their food is great. The presentation, set up, customer service - it's all been fantastic. The office loves it. 

We have ordered simple sandwich buffets, as well as full on turkey dinners. Everything we have ever received from them has been top notch. 

We placed an order last week for today, and there was a  communication error which resulted in them having never received the order. I spoke to the catering department at approx. 9:30am and they were still able to get our order put together and delivered to us by 1pm. It was a large order as well, for 53 people, including turkey, ham, baked potatoes, glazed carrots, and an assortment of desserts. Their ability to get us taken care of in such short notice is really incredible and I am very impressed. 

Had the communication error not happened in the first place, that would have been better, however, I understand that mistakes happen and it's not the end of the world. The way they were able to bounce back and still take care of us makes up for it. Big kudos to them for being able to pull through and make our event still a possibility."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast on the weekends.  The eggs benedict are nummy!  
Haven't been here for anything but breakfast yet."}
