{"text":"First time having Indian food and it was delicious.  Very friendly atmosphere.  I'll be back o my business trips.  Deserts were delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food. A must try place for everyone. My favs are:      - Fried Fish     - Masala Macaroni      - Gulab Jamun cheesecake     - Bombay Sloppy Joes  Will definitely be back for some more delicious Indian fusion food."}
{"text":"I and two friends were staying at a hotel in Toronto for six days.  The third evening we asked the concierge if there was an Indian restaurant within walking distance, and he named Maezo.    We walked in knowing nothing else about it.  Looking at the menu we could see it wasn't what we'd expected, but the owner and staff were friendly, the atmosphere was pleasant, and we were fairly tired, so we decided to stay, agreeing that we could always go to a more traditional Indian restaurant either later during our trip or after getting back home.  The punch line, such as it is, is that we enjoyed the food and all other aspects of the dining experience so much that we found ourselves returning to Maezo for another meal two days later, even though that meant skipping one of the Toronto restaurants we'd been planning to visit.  We sampled each other's choices, so I had the pleasure of experiencing at least three really enjoyable things I'd never expected to encounter in my life:  samosa chaat, masala macaroni, and curry poutine (actually, not ever having poutine was one of my long-term goals, but Maezo's curry poutine showed me the error of my ways).  All the other things we had there were very good as well, and now back in California with no Toronto or Maezo in my immediately foreseeable future, perhaps my biggest regret about the whole trip is \"why the hell didn't any of us order the Bombay Sloppy Joes?\""}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here. Efficient service and great food. Beef vendiloo and butter chicken were very good. I'd go back"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian fusion -- try the curry poutine or the shrimp saga. Nice people and good service"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations on a unique fusion culinary experience. Ended up very disappointed. Place had a handful of customers. You'll see why: Dishes are overly simple, no twist and a lack of flavor. Selection of beers was scarce too. We had the stuffed mushrooms as appetizer and the  malai meatball and the channa masala tacos as mains. The 2 instead of 1.5 is because our server was good. Would never eat here again. I think the place has potential. I'll give you that."}
{"text":"Overall poor experience.   We went on a weeknight around 6pm and the restaurant was almost empty. Despite this, the server was still inattentive and we were waiting repeatedly for our drinks, orders and bill.   They also failed to honor their Happy Hour drink specials. Clearly stated on their website is that Happy Hour is 4-7pm every weekday yet when we went and ordered at 6, they told us we had \"just missed it\" since it apparently ends at 6 despite the website saying 7 and us ordering at 6:05... This was compounded when they said that our Groupon voucher $30 for $50 could not be used for alcohol despite it saying nowhere on the Groupon terms that this was a condition. We told them at the beginning we would be using Groupon and they failed to inform us until payment.  The food, wish this made up for it/ made the dinner not a bust... It didn't. We ordered the Butter Chicken and the beef. Both were very standard, portion sizes were small and the sauces lacked flavor/ spices. We can both honestly say, working downtown, that we have had better Butter Chicken/ beef curries from Food Courts and Ritual. The original prices for these dishes at over $15 is also way overpriced for what you get.   Ambiance was also misleading as the bar pictured is beautiful but the rest of the restaurant is quite empty.   Poor experience, service and food - will not be returning."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a birthday dinner tonight but when we arrived, the host told us that the restaurant is closed for another private event. When we mentioned that we had made a reservation, they said they could only accommodate us on the side next to the large private event, which would have made for an awkward and unwelcoming atmosphere for us. The biggest issue here is that they should have informed us over the phone when we reserved (or any time before our reservation) that the space would be closed out for another event.   Extreme sloppy and poor customer service at this establishment. Would highly NOT recommend relying on this place if you are planning to come here for an important dinner."}
{"text":"The food will taste a little bit blend if you are expecting to get something close to the normal Indian food (we ordered masala macaroni and malai meatballs). There were no photos in menu which makes it hard to choose your meal. The place is dark, we felt a bit uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was awful. We had to ask for plates and cutlery after food was served and waiter just walked away. Place was not busy but we noted a few tables waited a long time for food... we waited 40 mins! Had to chase a waiter down for water to be refilled. You would think a new place would make an effort to provide outstanding service."}
{"text":"Overpriced and subpar. They've been putting up deals on yelp and Groupon to attract customers, but even with the discount it's still not worth it. We came for dinner and the place was empty.  The fusion tacos were terrible. The tortillas tasted store-bought. They came with a side of fries that tasked just like the ones you get frozen in a bag.   The butter chicken, pakoras, and fusion cheesecake were terrible was well. I couldn't find a single redeeming quality.  Don't be fooled by reviews. Be careful with which ones are by people affiliated with the business or friends with the owners."}
{"text":"I do feel bad about leaving a negative review, considering that our bartender, who was likely one of the business partners, was quite pleasant.  But I want others to avoid our experience of having seen positive reviews here and end up severely disappointed.  Of the positive reviews, the reviewers have either never had Indian food or are affiliated with the business.  I cannot fathom how Maezo could've earned such reviews otherwise.  We came here on a Groupon and even with the discount it was not even close to being worth it.  We had the pakoras, channa masala tacos, and the beef vindaloo.    Maezo presents itself as Indian fusion but it's as close to fusion as I'd say chicken balls from Canadian Chinese food is to Chinese fusion.  Actually that gives it too much credit as lots of people (mysteriously) enjoys chicken balls.  The pakoras were over fried and too doughy.  The tacos, as another poster mentioned, came with McCain fries, the channa masala lacked flavour - in fact, the whole meal was of the same theme, all the dishes lacked the depth of flavours from the use of many spices that Indian food is known for.  The menu claims that the tacos comes with guacamole but what you get is a pitifully tiny slice of avocado in each taco.  The beef vindaloo was not spicy in any way.  If you're going to call yourself fusion, at least put some effort into it!  Say, instead of using store-bought taco shells, maybe try using a parantha.  I do hope the owners make changes that would drive their business in a positive direction - I'm no fan of schadenfreude, after all."}
{"text":"As an Indian person going to an Indian restaurant, you could say I'd be slightly more critical on the food knowing that I've had a lot of Indian food in my lifetime. That being said, Maezo was impressive in terms of the food and the service for a downtown Toronto Indian fusion joint.  -The food comes to the table hot and it's well seasoned and pretty reminiscent of authentic Indian food. That being said, since this is a fusion restaurant, some items deviate from Indian food (Naan Nachos with hummus dip?). During my visit, I tried the Samosa Chaat, (4/5), Monsoon basket (4/5), Curry Poutine (2.5/5), Malai Meatballs (4/5) and Sweet potato tikkis (3/5). The tikkis didn't taste much like sweet potato at all and the curry poutine wasn't hot enough, cheesy enough or flavourful enough. Food is decently priced, the main's can be pretty pricey for what you're getting but the apps are within the $10-15 range and are worth it.We went with the all appetizers for dinner route and it was a pretty great meal. I'd recommend staying away from the entrees just because of reviews from other Yelpers and my pleasant experience with the apps. Next time I go, I'm trying the Samosadilla!   It's conveniently located in the Financial District, perfect to visit right after work for an early dinner. Would also recommend this place for a work lunch since its a short walk from work and the service is pretty quick.  The decor and ambiance are pretty good. There was old school and new  Bollywood music playing the entire time and I was digging it. There were also a couple TVs in the restaurant that were playing an old Bollywood movie.   If you're introducing anyone to Indian food for the first time or if you're coming with a large diverse group of people, I'd recommend Maezo as there's something to please everyone on their menu."}
{"text":"I work nearby and finally tried Maezo after it kept coming up on Ritual. I decided to pass on the lunch combos (I saw that a side of fries was an option which initially concerned me for an Indian restaurant), and went with palak paneer with naan for $17. When I went in, my food was ready on time and was waiting for me. The host was friendly and for the take-out service I'm giving the second star.  I brought my lunch back to work and was very disappointed. The paneer was absolutely store-bought and there was hardly any in my curry. The palak was simultaneously bitter and salty. The naan was definitely not fresh and I suspect it was also store-bought.  All in all I would say the food was food court quality at restaurant prices. It's too bad because I really wanted to find a good local Indian place to have regular lunches, and would have paid more for quality."}
{"text":"Good food and efficient service. The desserts is not something I expected them to be just your regular Indian one. The tikka wrap could use a little bit more heat and kick of spices. The portion size was a bit on the larger side especially the side of fries. Overall a nice twist on Indian food and no regrets"}
{"text":"Great employees, nice fusion food options with affordable wine. Cleanliness can be stepped up a touch but overall ambiance and food is lovely!!"}
{"text":"Home style cooking, delicious! Large space which is great for large groups and corporate events!  Excellent service with a personal touch! Will return!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Each dish tastes different and is so close to the authentic Indian food I get at home. The fun thing is hat there's a modern twist to go with it. Typically, most Indian restaurants use a lot of cream and everything tastes the same. Absolutely not the case here. I would 100% recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I believe this is the only Indian fusion restaurant in the financial district that isn't just a buffet or fast food. My husband and I have been here a few times. For myself - I love to start with the masala macaroni or the curry poutine (the appetizers are generous in size and a great value). For mains I always prefer the channa masala tacos. My husband usually doesn't love butter chicken as other places make it very sweet but he loves it here, he requests for it to be spicy so it's his go-to dish.   For dessert (if we have room) we get the gulab jamun cheesecake which melts in your mouth!  The service is great - management and staff go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant experience. Truly a gem in the heart of downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"One star for the butter chicken (great tastes tho small portion for the price)  One star for the macaroni (innovative) and the homemade Indian ice cream (coconut flavor, although terrible choice to serve with cold, hard brownies.... ice cream only goes well with larva cake or things that are hot and soft...)  One star for the service, she was lovely and helpful and heroically swept off the cockroach that was wandering on the table after I was served"}
{"text":"Overall not great! Here's what we ordered.   1. Butter chicken poutine- this was quite tasty but needed more cheese to be considered a poutine. It was more like a bowl of fries with a serving of butter chicken sauce on top.  It lacked both cheese and a good amount of chicken!  Otherwise the flavour was tasty and priced more reasonably compared to other things we tried on the menu. (3.5/5)   2. Beef Vindaloo - basically a beef stew. The was a good portion of beef in this dish but it was tough and not rich in flavours like I would expect from an Indian dish! This is really nothing special and definitely not worth paying $20 for. (3/5)  3. Palak Paneer - I love paneer and can't help but order it whenever I eat Indian. This was however a HUGE disappointment. Especially for $20 dollars, there was hardly any paneer and what was there was tough and over cooked. The palak sauce was incredibly salty, I barely touched it and still has to drink three glasses of water. Definitely would not recommend their paneer at all!! Big upset!! (1/5)   I also want to note that with our two mains we got one naan, cut into 4 quarters (measly serving!). Sad to say that this was probably the best tasting part of the mains and I presume they were store bought as they resembled the ones you can now get from loblaws. I  felt for the money we were paying, I'd expect more naan, paneer and less rice as a filler (although you'd probably need it with that all that salt!)   Overall I wouldn't recommend coming here. There are way better places for Indian food in the city which will get you far more for your money (in taste and value!).   Also to be upfront, we tried to use a Groupon and found out at the end of our meal that it couldn't be used during summerlicious. This was obviously a bummer given the quality of the meal, but also want to give everyone a heads up to read the fine print! (Boo!)"}
{"text":"I was attending a weekend conference and Maezo was the caterer for all three meals. I usually am not a fan of Indian food but they did an excellent job feeding us with the abundant food. They served us buffet style which included a variety of dishes like mushrooms, pasta, rice, chicken, fruits, potatoes and dessert.  Despite the marathon going on that weekend, they pulled a trolley instead of dropping off the meals by car. Everyone at the conference were happy with the meals throughout the weekend. It will be worth trying when I do pass by their restaurant with some friends."}
{"text":"We came across this place because it was nearby and sounded interesting. There was a Groupon deal so me and my friend decided to go for it.   First thing, it's a bit hard to see the restaurant. It's easy to walk past it because the only indication is a Steam Whistle sign sitting on the sidewalk with no indication of the restaurant name.   We walked in and was greeted with interesting decor. The bar has diamond chandeliers with a nice abundance of liquor bottles on display. The rest of the space has these contemporary light fixtures and I just get a bit of disconnect when it comes to the identity of the restaurant; it's not really sure what it is quite yet. The music jumps from Indian to Top 40s and played on a Spotify Free account; I know this because the advertisements in between are really distracting to the atmosphere.   Moving onto the food, we ordered the Sizzling Satay, Samosadillas, Beef Vindaloo and Creme Brulee. We shared everything and I would say we were both equally quite filled after sharing everything.   The Sizzling Satay contains chicken bites marinated in savory batter, then grilled into skewers and served with Maëzo special peanut sauce. This was quite good, the chicken tasted great but was a bit dry. The peanut sauce is quite good, wish there was more of it.   Onto the Samosadillas. This fusion of Mexican and Indian food was interesting; we chose to pair it with garden salad on the side. It was a good dish, don't have any complaints about it.   Now for the Beef Vindaloo. The beef curry is served with garlic naan & basmati rice. The beef was a bit dry but the curry sauce tasted good. The naan was alright and the rice was fine.   The waiter whose name is Ahmed, which I think was also the owner or manager, insisted we try a dessert and we obliged because he was very friendly and considerate from the start, giving us enough time between dishes to eat and converse.   We went for the creme brulee which had Indian jalebi on too. Jalebi was described to us by Ahmed as a sugary, orange flavoured candy that is normally fried. The jalebi we had on top of the creme brulee was baked instead but still pretty interesting to taste. The creme brulee was overcooked because there were chunks of yolks that broke the consistency of the brulee.  TL;DR: Ahmed was wonderful and elevated the entire experience to be better than I expected. The food is interesting but doesn't really deliver enough to sustain my interest. There is a confusion in approach with the identity of the restaurant and it shows through the interior to the menu."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place since it is pretty average but you can tell they are really trying.  Pretty basic and more like a 3.5. Fusion food tasted pretty good but the food was lukewarm and came within a few minutes which makes me believe it was sitting under a heat lamp.  Macaroni masala and curry poutine were delicious. The chicken satay and Cobb salad are skippable - dry, limp and lackluster. High points come at the end with their Creme Brulee and gulap Jaman cheese cake- must try. Service was decent but the ambiance is awkward with their soft and weird music choices.  The place is really trying to get people in with their multiple deals but they don't advertise that you can't use OpenTable and a Groupon."}
{"text":"Do not order the NY strip loin steak.    I order the NY strip loin steak, I've asked for medium rare. When it comes out, there is absolutely no red in it or pink for that matter, it was completely well done, so i ask to return it. A second steak comes out, and it is close to well done. No red and barely any pink but I don't complain and just eat it as I was starving at this point.  One of the staff, who may have been management, comes up to me and pretty much insults me by asking why I don't think the steak is medium rare, and I said that steak is red in the middle. He goes on and on about how the steak is temperature controled using a meat thermometer and that he just picked up his angus steak that day. What, did you say \"angus?\" I thought I was getting a strip loin, well that was insulting and now I feel ripped off.   On a side note, I purchased a deal on Travelzoo which does not place any restrictions on items that could be ordered. When we get there, the waitress tells us that there is a price limit to the items we can order, so when you add up each item we ordered, it pretty much came out to be close to the price I paid for the voucher.   Totally ripped off twice here. Not recommending this place, not going again."}
{"text":"The Palak Paneer was excellent. The proprietor greeted us and asked how we liked our meal. He was friendly and professional. Service was prompt. The decor was a bit dark for my taste. Prices were reasonable for downtown Toronto, but a bit higher than I would normally expect from an Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a delightful dinner in this fun, hip (great music) Indian fusion restaurant. Since my husband is Indian and I am German it's always fun to go to fusion places that blend flavors you typically don't find together. We started off with the Masala Macaroni, then I had the palak paneer and he had the butter chicken. The Marsala Macaroni was fun and feisty and a great flare on a traditional staple. My husband loved the butter chicken and said it was one of the most tender chicken dishes he has had in a long time. The palak paneer was amazing as well- even my 4 year old  loved the paneer.  We finished the meal off with an unexpected twist of gulab jamun cheese cake- fabulous! Everything was great: food was fresh and hot, the restaurant clean, and service quick and friendly. We met one of the owners Amit and he was super friendly. Highly recommend this place- even for families with small kids."}
{"text":"Solid modern Indian restaurant.   House salads = HUGE portion. Very basic. I wish portion was smaller and was somehow jazzed up in return for the smaller portion or a slightly higher price point.   Monsoon platter = pakoras. Delicious pakoras. Dipping sauce was great but served in this tiny ceramic cone, it was very hard to dip the pakoras into such a shape.   Butter chicken = excellent. Great curry to rice ratio.   Beef vindaloo = ditto!"}
{"text":"I file Maezo under Indian Fusion, as in Indian food with Canadian/Italian/Mexican/whatever international twists the chefs want.  The owners and chefs are obviously proud of their Indian heritage.  The menu contains both traditional Indian and modern fusion offerings.    This is a long review, so I put the conclusion up front: overall, I think the traditional offerings edge out the fusion ones.  This shows that, behind the Western ambiance, the restaurant offers fine Indian food.  Bold and proud.  The Indian Fusion offerings are ambitious, but there are hits and misses.  They could use further refinement.  I am confident that the talented chefs at Maezo are up for the tasks.  Detailed review below:  We ordered a Monsoon Basket (traditional) and a Curry Poutine (fusion) as appetizers, and a Beef Vindaloo (traditional) and a Channa Masala Tacos (fusion) as mains.  We rounded up the meal with a Carrot Halwa Trifle (traditional) and a Creme Brulee (fusion) as desserts.    The appetizers were stars of the evening.  The pakoras were among the best I have ever had.  As described in menu, they were deep fried to crispy heaven.  The skin was covered in a mix of spices that were bold yet not overwhelming.  I would gladly order the Monsoon Basket again in my next visit.  The fries, though came out from a bag, was deep fried nicely.  A hot crispy outside and a warm, not too soft inside.  The portion was hearty.  The curry was rich and creamy and was great on its own.  However, I think the amount of fries thinned out the curry flavour quite a bit.  The curry could be spicier to add a kick.    The Beef Vindaloo had a generous amount of beef.  The curry was thick and rich and 100% traditional.  The twist of the dish was the naan.  It was prepared with LOT of butter.  We freaking loved it!  I couldn't find the garlic flavour in the naan though.  The Channa Masala Tacos didn't fare as well as the Beef Vindaloo.  A taco with chickpeas in masala curry tasted alright in the flavour department.  However, the taco had no texture and body.  It was too soft.  Also, the tortilla could use some improvement.  The creme burlee was made with jalebi.  The circular sweet and the sweetened egg yolks balanced well.  I found this fusion burlee not too different from the traditional version.  If you want something familiar, this would be it.  The Carrot Halwa Trifle, on the other hand, was something new to me.  It was sweet but not overwhelmingly so.  The carrot was so finely grated that if I wasn't told it was made with carrot, I wouldn't have guessed it.   Last but not least, the services was outstanding.  We asked questions on various menu items.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and patient in answering them.  She also made good suggestions."}
{"text":"Disappointing! We got a Groupon with $50 for two and ordered their monsoon platter, butter chicken and malai platter. The pakora's in the monsoon platter were decent, but everything else was below average. The portions were tiny and the naan was not freshly prepared in house. That's definitely a deal breaker for me!! Don't go out to eat Indian food to get PC naan with my food! :( Not impressed.. definitely a pass!"}
{"text":"Visited Meazo as part of a weekday work lunch with colleagues. Being Summerlicious, we all decided to try offerings from that menu.   Chicken satay - not worth it. Tiny little skewers of chicken advertised as being served with a peanut sauce. The consensus at the table was that it seemed as though a sliver of cooked chicken was dipped in a bottle of Jiffy smooth peanut butter and put on the plate with some sesame seeds strewn atop. Flavour was off-putting to say the least.   The samosas looked decent. Sizeable and with decent flavour. naan chips with hummus were ok. Nothing special.   Most of us opted for the butter chicken which comes with a serving of basmati rice and a minuscule portion of pappadom. The butter chicken was good. Flavour was nice but it lacked any sort of kick.   Dessert was gulab jamuns or ice cream which were both ok.   Service is very slow and almost lethargic. Sort of like the feeling you get after eating an Indian meal of rice and curry for lunch and having to go back to work thereafter.   It's nice inside but as you walk in you are blasted in the face with a very strong odour of incense. It is way too much and actually makes you feel a bit nauseous.  Personally I would not return as there are many other far more authentic Indian food restaurants around."}
{"text":"Best part of my dining experience was the service and the owner. He was very welcoming, kind, and humble (he served our whole table).   (Disclaimer) Indian food is not high on my food-to-go, but as a immature foodie, i appreciate quality food.   Service: 5/5  Taste/food: it was more Indian fusion, so this was fun for me. Once I got past the  of each dish, I'd say it was pretty good -overall. My favourite was the deconstructed samosa. It was served in a bowl dish and served saucy. For me, I liked it a lot because I \"try\" to stay away from fried foods (fries are an absolute exception for me), but it was completely hidden and the sauce just made it more bold and flavourful.  Price: ? I went to an elite event, so I can't comment on that.   Overall, I would try it again with my avid Indian-cuisine lovers.  Great event from Yelp!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good. Super flavourful, really interesting and still very unpretentious. And the service is awesome. Super friendly ownership."}
{"text":"5 stars because the food was unbelievably good and the waitress was unbelievably kind. She was very informative of the menu, very attentive and even braved out the cold outside to hand over the scarf that I left. The beef vindaloo was a delight!"}
{"text":"Attractive bar and comfortable ambiance are among the top characteristics of this place.  Service can use a bit of help as we'd been sat waiting for dishes to be cleared and the opportunity to ask for another drink for extreme periods.  For the food offering - there is far better for the price.  Good attempt but nothing attractive about a $19 entree of beef vindaloo.  Highly touted julab jamon cheesecake was a huge disappointment comprising of a regular slice of cheesecake with several julab jamon halves surrounding it.  Pet peeve of mine - don't hover around when you bring the bill.  On review the next morning I only then realized that the bill had already included a service charge, unexpected as this was a dinner for two persons."}
{"text":"Service: (4 stars) - Friendly - refilled water multiple times - a bit on the slow side   Atmosphere (4 stars): - Looks very fancy - We were there on a Thursday night and the place was pretty empty. - They were placing EDM music   Food: (3 stars) - We got stuffed mushrooms appetizer (4 stars) - taste 5 stars, but for 11$ I expected more than 5 very small mushrooms - Mansoon Basket (5 stars) - really good and tasty.  Decent size for the price. - Lamb chops (2 stars): for $28 getting only 2 was a bit overpriced - Butter Chicken (4 stars) - a bit on the smaller size. It comes with pappadums (but it tasted stale) - Drinks (2 stars) ($9 a drink, for a small wine, or tap beer)  The total for 4 people, 4 entries, 2 appetizers and 4 drinks each was $186 (including tax and tip).     In my opinion, the cost is not worth it.  If you get living social deal it becomes decent, but I definitely would not go there and pay full price."}
{"text":"Located in downtown core, and it's completely empty during lunch on a workday. Upon arrival, we noticed that there was only one guy working. Super nice, and super friendly.   Four funny/interesting/weird things happened: 1. This is an Indian restaurant. For one of the beef dishes, it stated that it's their best and you have to try it. 2. They ran out of beef. 3. I ordered lamb, they ran out of lamb too. 4. Couple typos in the menu.  Lots of things were on the house and we got to sample some chips and a dessert. I got the chicken biyriani and it was pretty good. Decent price, decent portion."}
{"text":"Overpriced, sub-fast food level food. Plates had a film of dirty finger prints on them. Table had wet cloth marks all over it. Lazy cooking. Slow food delivery. Lentil \"soup\" was equivalent to an Extremely Strong and Thick curry-like sauce with an unpalatable spicy burnt taste to it; barely managed to finished 1 spoonful, much less an entire bowl. Naan \"pizza\" with curry chicken is really just naan with curry chicken. Hardly qualifies as \"fusion\" food. Did not appreciate that the gratuity was automatically tacked on to the bill. Service and the poutune were good. Sneaky, Lazy and Pretentious would be 3 adjectives I would find fitting in describing this place."}
{"text":"Must try: Samosa Chaat  This was a great overall dining experience. The food was very delicious and interesting - it's fusion, so think lighter version of indian food where you don't feel full after the first five bites.   The apps were basically the highlights for me. The whole table loved the Samosa Chaat, it was savory with a tinge of sweetness and tamarind tartness, very addicting!! The butter chicken poutine was very good as well, could maybe use a bit more chicken (smaller pieces maybe?) but the flavor was good.   For the mains, we tried the butter chicken and the biryani bowl. The butter chicken was better in terms of texture and flavor, the chicken was so tender!! The biryani bowl had pretty good rice, but it was a bit dryer than I expected and the chicken were big cube pieces which made it not as tender as the butter chicken. I think either whole chicken legs or smaller pieces work better for biryani bowl.  We also tried the gulab jamun cheesecake which the host brought out for my friend's birthday, and while the topping was very sweet (as gulab jamun tends to be), the cheesecake was not bad.  The other highlight was really the host. The day we dined there, they were preparing for a private event so we happened to be one of the two tables eating there. The host really made us feel special with his friendliness, witty bantering, and playing happy birthday for my friend through the restaurant speaker when he brought out the cake... how great is that!! The entire service from beginning to end was seamless. You can tell he really likes to make his patrons feel welcome.   Would come again for big events or small nice gathering!"}
{"text":"Right in the heart of financial district is the new place Maezo. This restaurant is on the quite street behind Roy Thompson building and has huge sitting area  to accommodate around 50-70 people. Good part about restaurant is the fusion of indian food.  For the starters we had stuffed mushroom and monsoon basket. Basket had crispy veggies and every bite of it was amazing. We even tried Chana tacos and samosadillas which is indian fusion with Mexican. Best part was malai meatballs suggested by co-owner Afreen. This tasted the best and was served with rice and Roti. Deserts here are love at first site and would suggest best in the menu, gulab Jamun cheesecake and creme brûlée."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Maezo this week.  The food was very tasty but I found that the entrees in particular were overpriced and the service was weak.    The Samosa Chaat ($12) appetizer was huge and a big hit with all of us.  This is a popular Indian street food in India and is tangy and sweet all at the time.  I did not find it spicy at all.  I would highly recommend this dish both in terms of taste and value for the money.    The Paneer Tikka Masala Wrap ($15) was delicious.  It came with a cup of lentil soup which was good but needed salt.  The Wrap was huge and very flavourful.  I could only eat half of it.   The Sagar Shrimp ($24) came with a side of rice.  The dish was very spicy and savory and we all loved the flavour but I felt that for the portion size, $24 was too steep for this dish.  I would have expected to pay no more than $16-$18 at most for entree.     For most of our lunch, there appeared to be only one server/hostess on the floor.  Towards the end, our food was being brought out by another gentleman (I assume he was the owner).  He was very friendly and accommodating, unlike the female server who seemed detached and unfriendly.    If it were not for the price for the entrees and the uneven service, I would have given Maezo five stars."}
{"text":"Decent Indian Contemporary Fusion restaurant with excellent location. Good spot to hand out and drink."}
