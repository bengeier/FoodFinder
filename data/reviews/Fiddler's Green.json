{"text":"There are numerous Irish Pubs around downtown Montreal. That being said, I would say that Fiddlers Green is one of the best. They were accommodating to our big group (~20 people). Food and drink were cheap, but very good. I got the chicken pot pie, and I cannot remember the last time I ate one that was this good. The sauce mixes in so well with the pie crust, and the chicken was still moist. My friends had the fish and chips, and they really enjoyed it. Drinks were also very nice. I got the beer cider (very light taste with a hint of cider). I would recommend anyone looking for an a pub to come to the Fiddlers Green."}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly for the Sunday night trivia (mostly in English, but French provided on request) hosted by Jerry. Jerry is great, and his trivias are unique because he really makes an effort to get to know all the teams each week, and sometimes they include tourists and visitors, and Jerry really knows how to make them feel welcome. And his trivias are fun! It's not all about sports and music, and you can have an input by suggesting categories!

That being said, the food is atrocious. During my time as a regular trivia attendee, I probably ate almost everything on the menu, and I can't think of a single thing that stands out. Thankfully, Bishop St. is full of great restaurants, so be sure to grab a dinner before heading over to Fiddler's Green for a drink and the trivia!

Other than the food, this place is fantastic -- friendly staff, good beer, good ambiance and convenient location!"}
{"text":"Great fun with friends tonight. Had the chicken pot pie which was massive and very tasty. The chocolate mousse was pretty good. Overall the ambiance was relaxed and our waitress, Siobhan, was very friendly."}
{"text":"Wir kommen aus Hamburg und haben einen Ausflug nach Stade gemacht.
Am Wochenende. Wo jeder Stader, der was auf sich hält, zum Ausgehen nach Hamburg fährt. Mit der S3. Das wir überhaupt in Stade sind, hat etwas mit Riten einer Männerrunde zu tun, weitere Nachfragen erübrigen sich bitte.


 Samstag Abend jedenfalls, die Stadt ist wie leergefegt, folgen wir der Empfehlung, es ist jetzt 23h, ins Fiddlers zu gehen.


 Auf der Straße fragen wir nach dem Weg, junge Leute bedeuten uns zu folgen, begleitet von den Worten: \"Da ist heute Ballermann-Party und sie können Sangria aus Eimern trinken\". Na, wenn das nichts ist.


 Im Fiddlers läuft dann auch nur Ballermann-Musik, die Atzen, Mickie Krause, Tom Toupet, Jürgen Drews und ganz viele Leute, die ich auch noch nie gehört habe.


 Augenflirts sind am Ende so betrunken, dass es nicht mehr zu einem Gespräch hätte kommen können, die Stimmung ist geprägt von viel Alkohol und eben der Musik.


 Irgendwie deprimierend. Um 2h klingelt es zur letzten Runde. Das ist auch gut so."}

I was looking for something not heavy, not expensive and not unhealthy and scored a hat trick with my creamy Guinness, hearty and health cream of vegetable soup and whole grain blt.

{"text":"Haben das Lokal bei unserem Stadeurlaub im Sommer besucht.
Als absolute Stimmungsfans sind wir natürlich am Donnerstag gegangen, wo es ein Karaokeangebot gibt.
Leider wars Stimmungsmässig nicht so der Knaller.
Klar, wir hatten unseren Spass, aber das lag wohl eher am Alkoholpegel und unsrer großen Gruppe!
Gesungen haben den ganzen Abend über nur wir und dazu kam, dass der Wirt extremst unhöflich war, den Gesang runtermachte oder einfach unpassende Witze riss. Vielleicht ist der Humor im Norden einfach anderst und man hat des sonst nicht so bemerkt oder der Typ weiss einfach nicht wie man sich als Geschäftsmann verhält!
Irisches Bier ist immer so eine Geschmackssache, aber zum Glück gibts auch a Weißbier. Die Damen an der Bar waren übringens trotz schlechten Vorbilds seitens ihres Chefs sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend!"}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way, the service can be quite slow and at times you might find yourself flagging down a waiter/waitress BUT DO NOT LET THIS STOP YOU FROM COMING HERE. 

This pub has the BEST pub food in the downtown core. Chicken pot pie is massive (it will have all the diners pointing at you, be warned), creamy and insanely delicious. The lamb and cheese burgers, served on pretzel buns with perfect complimentary toppings, are so juicy and flavorful. The bacon mac and cheese has HUGE PIECES of bacon in and on it. If it wasn't impolite, I would have licked my bowl clean. The cod tacos are more than filling. Last but not least, the rosemary seasoned fries... I could eat them all day. HECK even the desserts are good!

This place puts many pubs to shame because they have a REAL chef who cooks delicious food. I'm not much of a drinker, but the food keeps me coming back (again, and again and again...)"}
{"text":"Good pub atmosphere and live music. Perfect place for a pint and a laugh!"}
{"text":"A great pub! The people make it feel like a second home, I've never been to a bar where the people are so friendly. After going there once or twice they remembered my name and having drinks with us. They're a pretty awesomely outgoing staff. 

For food, try the spicy chicken burger, one of the best things I've had in a long time. And their mac & cheese is amazing on a cold day. And they have some of the best fries I've had in montreal, they come with this amazing spicy mayo. 

Monday night is 5$ mojito night, and Quentin makes a great mojito!"}

{"text":"Every thing that came out of the kitchen smelled fantastic. I had the mac & cheese. They didn't scrimp on cheese, but I did find it on the bland side. One of the people in my group had onion rings. They smelled fantastic and tasted just as good. This is saying something, since I don't even like onion rings.

The staff were very nice, and accommodated our group of knitters by leaving the lights up in the corner.

Looking forward to our next meet-up. I am planning on trying the rosemary fries with my Guinness."}

{"text":"Really Disappointed in this place. Was excited to go have breakfast and watch the rugby. Even though there were about 8 people there, we had to ask the barman three times for a cup of tea (worst tea I've had in a long time). Bar freezing all morning - everyone kept their coats on. Other diners near us who had ordered the sausages warned that they tasted really off. Passed a message to the chef when we ordered the breakfast that the sausages were bad (as in, spoiled, out of date) but he served them to us anyway. Took a cautious bite... sour taste of expired food - felt sick."}
{"text":"Very friendly bartender.  However,  the place was unkept, it looked rough.   I ordered a beer, and was excited to get the Fish and Chip's that I saw great reviews about.  During the course of that one beer I decided not to eat here due to the smell of mold, flies and generally messy appearance.  They may have been reeling from the lunch time crowd, so I'll give them the Ben o doubt."}

{"text":"I've been to a lot of bars in Montreal and this is certainly the worst one I've ever been to.

Their beer selection was atrocious, and there was a horrible, horrible cover band playing some of the worst music I've ever heard. Most bands, no matter how bad, get a round of applause after each song, these guys didn't get a single clap. No one wants to hear horrible covers of 90s songs sung by two guys in their 50s. I felt embarrassed for them. It seemed like the far majority of people in the bar were trying to have conversations, certainly my group was, but it was impossible over the racket made by these two fools. 

There was also a large pile of garbage and empty kegs in the back of the bar - not the back room but in the actual bar.

I have never had such a bad experience in any bar and I will not be going back. I cannot understand why this place has such high reviews on Yelp. I can only guess that the owners must be putting positive reviews on themselves or that these reviews are written by tourists who have no taste, didn't go to any other bars in Montreal (seriously, try and of the other bars on the street, they're all better than this one) or have never been to a bar before in their life."}
{"text":"Wer ein Irish Pub erwartet sollte nicht hier einkehren. Mit ein paar irischen Nationalfahnen ist es nicht getan. Die Musik außerhalb der Live-Auftritte gibt einem nicht das Gefühl eines Pubs von der Insel. Wer einmal in England oder Irland im Pub war, versteht was ich meine. 

Ich kenne in Deutschland viel bessere Irish Pubs, die nicht einfach mit Deko vollgestopft werden."}
{"text":"My favourite pub in Montreal! 

Food: The kitchen here is the size of a postage stamp, but they turn out a good variety of extremely high-quality food. Fish n' Chips, burgers, pizza, curry - inexpensive and delicious. 
Make sure to check out their lunch special: Monday to Saturday, Noon-7pm. $12.99 will get you a starter (choice of soup or salad of the day); a main (daily menu, recent examples including lamb shank, beef Bourguignon, pan-seared salmon, etc); and a dessert. 

Booze: About 20 beers on tap, including the smoothest Guinness in Montreal, and a decent selection of whiskies, as well as an attentive staff who can mix you up pretty much any other drink you want. You won't go thirsty.

Staff: Hand-picked and shipped fresh from Ireland (as well as France and England) the staff are friendly, accommodating, charming, and lots off fun. Stop in on a quiet night and they'll make you feel right at home.

Atmosphere: During the week, and before about 10pm, this is usually a quiet, cozy place, perfect for a quiet pint and a book or newspaper. On late weekend nights, the pace picks up, and there's a party going on almost every Saturday. The traditional decor and classic copper bar are timeless and comfortable. 

Events: Fiddler's Green hosts a lot of events, including Games Night on Monday (come to play poker, scrabble, cranium, and other board games), a traditional Irish session on Wednesdays (come by with your fiddle, whistle, mandolin, or bodhran and join in!), and a Pub Quiz every Sunday at 8. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays often have live music from a variety of local bands.

Can't say enough about this bar - come on over and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips are excellent, cod tacos are amazing, beer is cold, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Fiddler's Green. It definitely lived up to the hype! Delicious food, relaxed atmosphere and a house beer, what more could a gal want? I went for a weekday lunch with a friend and it was a great spot to sit and chat. The food was better than standard pub fare, at more than reasonable prices. I had the cod tacos, and to repeat what others have mentioned and I failed to accept: the cod tacos could have easily been split between my friend and I. Instead I got leftovers for future enjoyment (and enjoy I did!).  There was only only waitress working while we were there, and she did her job with gusto, checking in on us occasionally but giving us our space.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here from a recommendation of a friend on Yelp.

The ambience is absolutely great, love the wooden benches and retro-looking decors. The food tastes great, and their beer is amazing (first time having a glass of Guinness).

They have amazing wings, tasty cod tacos, and their ROSEMARY FRENCH FRIES are a MUST!

My only disappointment is their service... My friend and I seemed to be ignored most of the time, and the bar was not even full... Furthermore, food came out a bit too slow."}
{"text":"Don't go before a HABS game! 
We went there before going to the bell centre and when it got busy the staff was beyond overwhelmed. Disaster service. The food was good but our table wasn't served all at once. I think this place is better in the summer with its terrasse. 


I'll go back but not before a game"}
{"text":"Nice little Irish pub with good, reasonably priced food and drinks, and friendly service. I had the chicken pot pie.

Bonus: The men's washroom was exceptionally clean by pub standards."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best bar food I have ever eaten. 

Cod tacos? Bacon and cheese burger? HOLY MOLY. 
The burger was, by far, my favourite... ever.

Bar food prices for amazing quality, I was very impressed. The service was great, our servers were helpful and so kind. The bar wasn't too packed, but pleasantly active. 

I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Went to a Sunday night trivia and ha an excellent time. No cover, just the cost of drinks and food. Trivia involved several rounds with mini games in between. Seems like an attraction for english and irish patrons!"}
{"text":"checked it out based on yelp reviews 
The local lager was proper - and chicken pot pie was deftly a hit - overall decent experience for sure!"}
{"text":"Number 1 go-to pub downtown by far. Cozy, small Irish pub that is not packed like all the other pubs around. Have been here many times for birthdays and casual hangouts. Very cheap (and good!) food and drinks, have never been surprised by my bill. There's a good variety of beers and cocktails, all pretty standard and not too out of the ordinary. The food portions are huuuge (try the chicken pot pie)! Very casual ambiance, very friendly and chillax bartenders/waiters. There are also some board games available. The modified Jenga game with dares written on each block is hilarious to play when you're tipsy. Favorite part is the weekly trivia nights, where the whole pub plays together and free shots are given to winners throughout the night. Overall highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to this place to see my friend who had picked up a couple of shifts. This place really doesn't look like much from the outside, the sign is really dark and you have to go down some dirty stairs to get to the door. The inside is really pub-y looking and feels comfortable, there is a giant selection of beer and alcohol to choose from and the menu has some different and interesting things. I chose the cod tacos (because how could I not?) and my friend had the mac & cheese. Both of our plates could have been shared because they were massive servings. The mac & cheese was really yummy. The cod tacos could have used a bit more seasoning but overall were very yummy and a good change from the normal fried everything pub food. This would be a good place to go with a bunch of friends to chill after work or school, have a snack and try out some beers."}
{"text":"They switched chefs.
I miss my tasty thyme-y chicken wings.
Hell, a lot of the food isn't as great as it was, but it's still good enough to give a try.
Their onion rings are amazing though & my hubby still loves the cod tacos."}
{"text":"Good booze. Good food. Sweet Irish server. 
The terrace is a pretty good size on the shady side of the street so you can sit out there for hours, or all day, without being uncomfortable - they also put up large umbrellas to shade you. They're dog friendly outside, and that's really cool, even giving the pup next to us a potato to chew on! 
Summary: they're not reinventing the wheel, but they're nailing the pub thing."}
{"text":"Massive quantities & yummy food, good ambiance BUT terribly slow and somewhat incompetent service."}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch spots downtown! Fiddlers Green is cozy, well-priced and has surprisingly good food! Their fish tacos are fantastic as is their weekday lunch special. 12.99 for a soup/salad, main and dessert! Today's was a cream of pumpkin soup, baked cod with beurre blanc and a tarte tatin. Now, it's not the best food in the city, but for pub food, it's very respectable and reasonable. 

I haven't yet been here for dinner or drinks, but I imagine they're probably just as great. The atmosphere is cozy without being overly intimate, and the wood paneling everywhere is a really nice touch. The service is also top-notch, especially considering some of the other pubs in the area. I can't wait to come for trivia night!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed to say the least. The first time I tried fiddlers green I had a great time. The second time around the service was poor and the food wasn't the same. I ordered the same thing the chicken pot pie which was amazing the first visit, the next time not so much. Also I find it annoying when you go to a pub and are unable to order drinks. The delay was crazy they would of made more money on our table alone. The waitress was a doll however she did say they are short staff I feel bad and I will definitely give it another shot because they do have great food!"}
{"text":"10/10 would spend another four hours there. Order fish, and the house drink for a perfect moment."}
{"text":"Fiddler's Green is a nice place with uncomfortable furniture and great food with huge portions.  One of my companions got the chicken pot pie and a side of mac & cheese.  Despite the waiter's warnings, he persisted on ordering a disgusting quantity of food.  It tasted so good, that he finished it all.

Fiddler's Green has a good drink selection with friendly servers who are not afraid to tell you what they think about your drink order.  You may get teased if you are a man who orders the \"Dr. Pepper\".

In addition to the good food and service, there is some interesting scenery.  Our table was adjacent to an alley where we saw an old woman with a can of Budweiser urinating behind a couch.  Very entertaining!"}
{"text":"Tu parles d'une place chill! J'adore le lieu pour aller prendre un verre et jouer à des jeux de société entre amis (nous, on amène toujours un Scrabble pour y passer le temps). À part ça, l'alcool est à bon prix et le menu est aussi bien accessible et fidel à la tradition pub. Leurs spécialités ne sont, par contre, pas celles à laquelles on s'attendrait. Leurs tacos au poisson sont débiles, leur macaroni au fromage avec bacon sait satisfaire les plus gourmand et leur burger au poulet épicé est tout simplement délicieux! Et pour les amateurs de terraces, ils on un bon patio qui adonne sur la rue."}
{"text":"Why I love this place:

- Rosemary French Fries
- Great ambience
- Fiddle jams during the week
- Fish and Chips
- Our current scrabble game place

If you are looking for friendly people, servers, great food and not too noisy of a place, this is it. I really really enjoyed my times here. I love how cozy and quaint it is, but honestly I'd go back just to listen to the music! I loved how everyone just got together with their instruments and did their thing, and it wasn't too loud and drowning out conversation. (Did I mention the sighting of a harp?) 

So you should try it out, it was recommended to me by Paul,  a friend, and I think his word has definitely got more clout now!"}
{"text":"Worst pub around! Attended for a friends birthday party and the waitress had put unexpected charges on all our bills. When we questioned her, we had been told that another table had made the orders and told her that they were with us. Never once did she bother to ask us if the other table was in fact  with us. She was also very hesitant to admit that she was in the wrong. Management did nothing to help out in the situation. 

Last time I go to this establishment."}
{"text":"Once upon a time this place had another name and was a favourite hang out of mine.
Went there last night. We ordered the steak, they didn't have any. Decided on the catch of the day, they didn't have any.
The place is extremely authentic and they offer a great variety of Irish beers, but the service is slow. Very friendly, but sadly slow.
This place also gets crammed very quickly. They can put the tables in ways that would be less cramped and over loaded. It makes the place look cluttered.
I will still go back to enjoy fair priced beers, especially Kilkenny at happy hour, but I doubt it'll become my \"hangout\" ever again.
This place has so much potential, they just need to really focus on it and it can be THE Irish pub to go to...."}
{"text":"Wasn't really the most exiting place around.
Still, they have a nice selection of Irish Beers (the basics), at ok prices. Their poutine is not so bad as well.
The decoration is close enough to an authentic Irish Pub, so no complaints there.
Service was ok, maybe a bit slow. 
There's also an outside patio which is nice."}

Mais  la  deuxième  la  la  nourriture  était était  fade  et manquait  de  saveur  !!!  C'est  seulement  la  bière  qui  était  bonne"}
{"text":"What an excellent cozy friendly joint, with surprisingly delicious and affordable food! I was hugely happy with the battered cod tacos I scarfed down last night, which I only ordered because when do you see cod tacos on a pub menu? Served on a sturdy wooden cutting board were two baskets of two-hand sized tacos stuffed to the brim with plump, lovely lightly battered cod, and delicious guacamole and salsa. Also on the board were an unexpected basket of rosemary fries, and a bowl of salad - just nice fresh mixed greens and tomatoes. This fed myself and a friend and the fries were shared around the table and the whole meal cost about $12. (Round of applause for all things affordable and tasty and unexpected!!) 

While we ate and drank our pints the placed filled up nicely and the back section became a fiddle jam. Service was friendly and lowkey and the room itself is aged wood and leather, comfy but not cluttered with pub gimmickery. Tasteful and cozy cool all around, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing friendly service! Awesome food! The portions are great! It is well worth every penny. We ordered the Mac and cheese, chicken pot pie, and hand cut fries. They were all so delicious."}
{"text":"Stade hat zwar kein besonders großes Nachtleben, aber das Fiddler's kann einem den Samstagabend bereichern. 
Oftmals ist es für uns ein super Treffpunkt am Wochenende. Man verabredet sich, trifft sich an einem der Stehtische, bestellt sich ein feines Cider oder aber ein typisches irisches Bier. Wer kein Bier mag, wird mit feinen Longdrinks und Shots versorgt. Unterhalten wird man von einem Live-Sänger oder einer Live-Band. Mein absoluter Favorit ist John Eid. Wenn er auf dem Programm steht, muss man ins Fiddler's! Er covert sämtliche Songs aus der Musikgeschichte und auch Wünsche werden angenommen. 
Bei dem Fiddler's handelt es sich um einen typischen Irish Pub!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch a hockey game, Boston vs. MTL. I am not a fan of hockey but it was a fun night anyways. The weather in May was perfect, so we sat outside as that was where we could find a table. Their wings were delicious, I think my favorite was garlic Parmesan or something. We also tried the pulled pork poutine which was just ok., Stick with the wings. The service was very good, never went more than a minute or two without  drinks."}
{"text":"The hot wings are unspeakably bad, the atmosphere is boring/uninspired, and the beer is over priced. 

Specifically, the buffalo wings are bland. It's just BBQ sauce and there are no dipping sauces besides mayonnaise and mustard."}
{"text":"This place is great for the following reasons: 

- Vincent, the awesome bartender who is well versed in whiskey and bourbon

- THE FOOD. So far, I've tried the poutine, calamari, curry, onion rings, rosemary fries and the lamb burger. It was all sooooo delicious! This is the best burger ever. 

- There is a patio. 

- WC is clean and well-maintained (well the ladies' WC is)

- Sunday night is trivia night. We won a bunch of shooters and a $50 voucher! 

I'm so glad found this awesome pub, all thanks to Yelp."}
{"text":"This is really the only time the Yelp reviews have let me down.  I will give this place 2 stars but my husband would give it 3 stars. We just had dinner here tonight and my husband  ordered the beef bourgeon and i had the cod tacos our son had the hamburger. The cod tacos were decent. Not the most flavorful but not bland. I have had better but also worse. I think the thing that bothered me was there was to much toppings that it made it hard to eat. Sometimes more is not better. The beef bourgeon was not great, the beef was not melt in your mouth tender, it was chewy. It was not made fresh that day, it was salty and overall don't bother. Mind you I am comparing to the same dish in Paris and it is after all an irish pub.  The bartender was nice and the atmosphere was great. One thing that was exactly like Ireland was they give you very little ice in any drink. I asked for cold water and I got water with no ice. Soft drinks have maybe 6 tiny ice cubes. Very  Irish.  
I am sure it is a great neighborhood pub to drink in."}
{"text":"At first my friend and I grabbed a table and there and the staff didn't even serve us. We waited almost 15 minutes and were about to leave when we saw one of the bar maids bring a burger and chicken pot pie to the table next to us and it looked amazing! We decided to stay and switch tables just to try the food. 

After switching tables we immediately got service. The bar maid was extremely  attentive. I ordered Guiness with Fish 'n Chips and my friend got the Chicken Pot Pie. My meal was really good, no complaints. Their salad has a really nice dressing. My friend absolutely enjoyed her Chicken Pot Pie (It looked awesome!). I'm going to get that the next time we go.  

This most likely would have been a terrible review if we didn't switch tables. The bar maid on the other side really made this a positive experience along with the great food! A quiet place to  hang your hat and enjoy a nice meal with friends. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love Irish pubs and feel bad rating Fiddler's Green with four out of six stars... The cod tacos unfortunately did not live up to the expectations set by fellow yelpers. What happens when you soak battered cod in salsa, the batter is getting soggy and is better to be removed. The guacamole was nowhere to be found, at least the french fries were really good. Judging by the cod and fries quality, I would assume fish and chips is the better choice if you need food. The pizza is of decent size and it has bacon! Another misadventure was my choice of cocktail, the Kamikaze was like lemonade, no vodka in it. My mistake, when in Irish pub stick to Irish beer, but on Friday night I was hoping for something strong after a long work week. I wisely finished my night with Kilkenny and this was the right drink. The pub still has this wonderful authentic interior and little relaxed patio. Really nice place to come for a pint or two with friends!"}
{"text":"Das Fiddler`s Green in Stade ist mein Liebilingspub im Landkreis Stade und Umgebung. Sauber, gemütlich und freundlich.
Ok, irische Live Musik findet man hier eher selten. Dafür aber regelmäßig Live Musik von verschiedenen Bands und Musikern.
Dazu gibt es Fußball Übertragungen usw.

Die Getränke sind top, ebenso der Service. Die Mädels sind arg am rennen und zapfen. Dennoch freundlich. Preislich auch absolut im Rahmen. 

Mitten in Stade City gelegen. Taxistand direkt vor der Tür (Pferdemarkt-Bushaltestellen).
Zum Bahnhof auch nur 10 Minuten zu Fuß.
Was will man mehr?"}
{"text":"Fiddler's green has some of the best pub food at the best prices anywhere in Montreal. It's price point is fair and its rosemary fries with spicy mayo are just addictive. the mood in this pub is very chill when they play music such as Mumford and Sons. The happy hour at this pub is however laughable. A regular beer costs 8$ while during happy hour its 7$, not much for savings. The service at fiddler's is sadly terrible. The other day it took me 15 minutes to get my beer order, and the waitresses seem like they've never worked in the restaurant or bar industry before. Fix these problems and Fiddler's Green would be a no brainer on a night out."}

{"text":"Came here post Xmas trip! 
From the outside this place looks like  a reg Irish pub, but if u ordered the food u wud know why this place is almost perfect score! 

Had the fish tacos! Am obsessed with those lately! It was huge!! And very filling! Two came per order along with a side salad(health!) and fries(my fave!!)!

Love the sauce and guacamole! Had to ask for hot sauce coz I prefer my tacos with a bit of kick! 

My bf had the spicy chicken burger with bacon! It wasn't the usual deep fried chicken with spicy sauce! It was slightly browned chicken drenched in this yummy spicy, tangy sauce! 

The waitress was very attentive too! She reminded me of Shannon Doherty with a French accent!

They had a good selection of beer, a little on the pricier side in comparison to other places in Montreal but understandable as lots were imported beer! 

Overall, love this little dive! Definitely a must try!"}

{"text":"I've walked by Fiddler's Green dozens of times but I always ended up next door at Irish Embassy.  After having finally tried it out I think I'll definitely be coming here more often.  It's a small pub with a cozy feel to it.   They have a good selection of beers on tap and at happy hour the beers are $1 off.

They have a small menu of reasonably priced food.  I had the macaroni and cheese with bacon.  It was very creamy and I did enjoy it but the portion was a little small and I didn't really feel full after.  I also tried some of my friend's nachos and those were good.  That portion also looked much larger.

Our waiter was very friendly and the overall service experience was a good one.  I will definitely be back here in the future to try some of their other menu items.  It is definitely a great place to come for a casual drink after work."}
{"text":"Hands down Montreal's number one Irish pub. A cozy establishment with room enough for you and your mates any day of the week. What sets them aside from other pubs is the quality of pub food served, as well as their satisfying and affordable house beer.

I've had a number of dishes here, but most recently the lamb burger. A well cooked lamb patty between soft buns amd whatever else was inside, left me satisfied and ready for a night of drinking. Definately have had better nachos, but as far as pub nachos go these are pretty awesome. Genourous amounts of cheese and salsa, served with salsa, guac and sour cream...Just wished they would layer them properly! 

I would be happy if Fiddler's was the only bar I was aloud to frequent."}
{"text":"Habe mit einem guten Freund am WE das Fiddlers nach langer Zeit wieder besucht. Es war echt nett und die Whiskykarte lohnt sich tatsächlich.
gegen späten Abend wurde es auch richtig voll
Wenn jetzt noch der Ardbeg in die Getränkekarte aufgenommen wird, gibts glatt den fünften Stern.."}
{"text":"Never thought I would ever come out of an Irish pub saying, \"Wow I really enjoyed my food just now!\" It's my hubby's favorite Irish pub but the only times I've been there were to pick him up on our way to have dinner elsewhere. Until last night, when I decided to give the place a go. I had the Irish lamb stew while hubby had the bavette that came with fries and salad. Everything was good! The bavette was particularly juicy and tender and the fries fried the way they should. Prices are super affordable too, compared to other Irish pubs downtown. The wooden tables lining the walls are especially cute and make for an authentic local pub feel. If I ever decide to have a favorite Irish pub, this would probably be it."}
{"text":"Montréal ne manque pas de bons pubs pour prendre une pinte de bière après le travail, la fin de semaine ou quand vous prenez la décisions \"qu'il doit bien être 17h à quelques part dans le monde!\" Le Fiddlers Green est probablement le pub qui ressemble le plus à ce que j'adore des \"hotels australiens.\" Bouffe réconfort (fish n' chips, chicken pot pie, plateau de charcuteries), bières et quelques activités spéciales comme les lundis \"jeux de société\" , des soirées de musique \"jam\" et des quiz. C'est petit mais chaleureux et ça vous transporte en Irlande (ou du moins ce que je l'imagine être) en peu de temps. À essayer quand on a le goût de relaxer et s'amuser entre amis."}
{"text":"Two words: cod tacos; so freaking yummy, affordable and enough for two people. The beer here flows freely, the staff is fantastic, the ambience in the basement is quaint and the place fills up quickly. I loved the fiddle jam session going on in the back corner and how everyone was more than welcome to crowd around, clap and feel like they were part of it. The lunch specials cannot be beat and they pour a mean pint of Guinness: I will be back!"}
