{"text":"Wow, this place is certainly empty for a reason! The meat in our entrees was way over cooked, or perhaps cooked days before and reheated?  The quality of the food was very poor in comparison to the prices on the menu.  But actually, I would have returned my dish even if I was at a fast food restaurant...which is where I headed after leaving.   The bruschetta was good, and the place was clean but this is about all of the positive comments that I can make on Joey's California Bistro.  Too bad, I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Intimate, quiet & relaxing! Great for date night! We had pizza wine & beer, amazing! In fact - we just got home after having a second drink & I felt the need to write a review! Family owned, great service - food was absolutely delicious! Give it a try - I am shocked by the bad reviews."}
{"text":"i came in just last night with three others, place was dead on a Tuesday night (around 8 PM) not a big deal though, i liked the large windows, full bar, and candle lit tables.  Menu had many nice choices and i decided on the baked ziti.  my dish came with a side salad, and the produce was nice and fresh!  my ziti was delicious! one of the best i have ever had! my friends had the bbq chicken pizza.  you could tell that quality ingredients were used.  i tried a bit and didnt care for the crust, which of course is a personal preference.  i felt like it was too thick (im a thin crust fan) but one of my friends quickly disagreed with me, stating that  it is was perfect and exactly how he liked it!  so if the food was so good, why only three stars?  mainly because when i go out to eat with friends i go to be with them, not talk with the owner our entire meal.  i don't mind a quick conversation or sharing a laugh, but id rather enjoy a conversation with the company i chose.  if i wanted to converse, i would have sat at the bar.  all of our orders where put in and made correctly, everything we needed was there, which is also important and i don't mean to discredit that.  Yet at the end of the meal, i felt like i hadn't been able to catch up with my friends at all! (why we went out to dinner in the first place).  We came for the food and each others company and only left half satisfied (the food was good!)  one of my friends mentioned that they would feel awkward returning because they felt like the owner talked to us the whole time and controlled the conversation and doesn't want to go back to \"visit with the owner again\".  He is a friendly guy and just needs to know when or when not to include himself in a conversation, and when he does, he should be able to cut it short so \"we can enjoy our meal\", or any other polite way to excuse himself and let us enjoy each other as well."}
{"text":"GROSS!!!!!!!My husband and I moved to the area about 2 yrs ago. I always see this place but have never tried it...Until last night. What a mistake that was. My mother and I were going to grab a bite before seeing a movie and she mentioned Italian. I did a local search on my phone and came up with this place. We walked in and the place was a complete hot and stuffy ghost town. We canceled our order of iced tea and water  so we could leave, but decided to stay. The water was served in a Bud Light pint glass with next to no ice. The tea was served in a wine glass....Huh??  Upon opening the menu  I was shocked. Given the location and décor, the prices were absolutely ridiculous. I ordered the Shrimp alfredo, she the eggplant parm.  My sauce tasted like it was from a can and had the viscous consistency of cheez whiz. Not to mention the TINY shrimp were what I would imagine chewing on an old tire would feel like. My mothers eggplant was chewy, not peeled, and drowning in cheap greasy cheese. I sent mine back, and declined a diff entrée. My mother powered through hers and ended up paying 20 bucks for it..  This place needs a Kitchen Nightmares make over ASAP!! I feel sorry for the poor staff who choose to hang on to the railing of this sinking ship. Our server was sweet. Poor gal. Left a good tip... Here's one for you reading this...DON'T GO! I ended up at the fast food place in the same complex which was still gross."}
{"text":"We decided to try Joey's because Red Devil was slammed. I have lived near it for several years, and I can't say why we never went before.  It sits in a strip center next to Safeway. You'd think it would be slamming on a Friday night, but it was not. We were one of four tables when arrived. More people came later, but it was not packed.  The service was nice and fairly attentive. The food was OK. Everything was hot and it was obvious that it had been cooked to order. My partner got pizza, which she reported was OK. The pizza was $15. I got chicken caccitorie, which was $16.95. The chicken came with a nice side of veggies, which were obviously prepared from fresh. I just wish they didn't have so much oil on them, still the fact that they had been actually peeled, cut and cooked properly was nice. The chicken was tender and well cooked. The dish also had sausage in it. It was nice that they took the casing out of the sausage. My dish came with a salad, which had also clearly been prepped by hand. Nice touch and fairly fresh. The salad was a bit on the small side.  I guess everything was pretty good. I felt overall that it was good (not excellent). But the prices did seem a bit high. I could see paying $12 for each of the dishes, but the prices were high for what you got.  They also brought us bread, which was on the warm side. It was OK.  I'm not sure if we'd go back. We would for sure if it was less $$, and I'm not a cheapo. But the bill came to $39 for two entrees and one beer."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple of days ago.  We arrived a few minutes after 12 on a Wednesday and it was a morgue.  The staff was sitting around watching tv and I felt like we interrupted them.  It's an ok place and I guess my beef with this place is that it's like amateur hour.  I get the feeling that they opened this place with no prior restaurant knowledge just that someone liked their chicken parm and were told they ought to open a restaurant.  That's a great start and probably how many mom and pop places start but it is clear that they need some restaurateur guidance.  The food chicken parm was decent but my friend said that their sausage peppers tasted like it was made the day before.  Another reviewer described the decor as being in their grandparents house.  That's spot on."}
{"text":"We had a family function here and I was sadly disappointed. I felt that the entrees were of average quality , but the service was terrible. We had made a reservation days in advance yet still the staff seemed unprepared for our service. We sat for ages until we finally had to ask for them to take our orders. I believe I asked for wine, then water 3 times as did other members of our party until my husband just started walking up to the bar and basically serving our party drinks."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place is still in business. We recently moved to the area and were were trying out all the restaurants. We ended up here on our anniversary.  The place was empty (that should have been our first clue).  All I remember is it was pretty expensive and it wasn't even good.    If you want Italian food in the Deer Valley area, go to Time Square on 27th Ave & Deer Valley."}
{"text":"Really like this place as apotential  neighborhood hang.  I got the lasagna and it was delicious and very filling.  The bistro salad I got before dinner had very fresh produce and was NOT loser iceberg.  The dining room was comfortable, service was friendly and efficient, and everything was clean as a whistle. Don't come expecting gourmet.  This was good, homestyle cooking in a friendly, relaxing environment and , for me, that is perfect."}
{"text":"We stopped into this place for lunch.   We'll kind of stumbled upon it.  We were the only people in the restaurant but it was the middle of the afternoon.  The lunch menu wasn't much but it was so delicious. There were four of us and we had the alfredo and the cheese pizza. Both were very very good.  If we lived in the Phoenix area, we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"First time here, wasn't sure what I would get and I was really surprised! They waited on yes so well,good was great and served got! Oh and a FULL BAR! awesome place!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this and I was expecting something other than Italian, but I'm so okay with it. The ravioli I had was absolutely spectacular and so filling and just what I needed. My stepdad got the regular old spaghetti but it was no ordinary spaghetti, in his words, it was \"just what he needed.\" He and I both agreed this is definitely be our new Italian place!"}
{"text":"I have recently reconsidered trying this place again which led me here after looking at their menu on their website, and I remembered why I have lived just a block away for seven years and have only been once. Way over-priced!!!! This place is trying to be something it is not. I'm sorry but it is more than olive garden and someone mentioned macaroni grill and pales in comparison. There is a reason that almost every single review on here mentions that they were either the only patrons in the place or close to it. I walked into this place seven years ago and looked at their menu prices and instead of just walking out, I ordered one kid's meal for my daughter-some spagetti noodles- It was subpar at best. And seven dollars for mac-n-cheese, that is outrageous! I have been many places and have ordered many kid's mac-n-cheese (it's all my daughter wants) and NEVER has it been seven dollars! It really is a shame, I drive passed this place every day going to Safeway and whatnot, and am always looking for a place to sit down with family and enjoy good food, without breaking the bank. The prices should reflect the food, the location, the atmosphere and decor, and the service. If it did, there would be people there eating, rather than a ghost town. Honestly, I am surprised it is still in business."}
{"text":"WOW! Intimate,  no noise, 10 plus food! Try the veal marsala! Will bring family next time."}
{"text":"I love this place!! A friend and myself came in one day for dinner and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and it was delicious! I just went back a second time and took my husband who had some of my left overs and had been wanting to go back. He got the spaghetti and sausage which was also amazing! We were told they make their own bread there and sausage which is a family recipe. I would highly  recommend this place and would go myself much more often if I lived closer to it."}
{"text":"It all started when my husband and I were hungry and decided to give this place a try and placed an order to go. We immediately fell in love with the food! We started coming at least once a week and are always satisfied. Food is amazing! Customer service is wonderful. Owner of the restaurant is extremely nice and friendly. We even brought a few of our friends from out of town and they loved it as well. We will keep coming back. My fave is the baked ziti. Yumm!!!! Highly recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"We're new to the area and were just driving around and happened upon joeys. On first impression it looked like a nice place with a very family-like ambiance. Our waitress Rose was amazingly helpful and the food was, if a little pricey, absolutely superb.   The caprese was light and very simple and the penne ravioli with chicken was cooked perfectly and had great flavors. After our dinner they brought my 3 yr old daughter out some in house made ice cream as a treat for finishing all her food and we got the homemade tiramisu. Both were sweet and delicious and finished the dinner perfectly.  The bill was, as I said before, a little pricey. For my family it was about $75 (2 adults and a child). But in my opinion it was well worth it."}
{"text":"The eggplant  is smoky and delicious - the best I've had. The waitress told me it is roasted in the wood fire pizza oven. The bread is freshly made; the marinara pasta sauce just perfect. It is head and shoulders above the typical chain Italian restaurants. And while I like Red Devil's pizza, the pasta and chicken dishes can't compare to Joey's. Also, the ambience is nice, even with outdoor seating, in an otherwise unassuming strip mall. The servers were attentive without being intrusive. I can't wait to get back here again."}
{"text":"1st time here & the food was rich and delicious! We started with the Calamari appetizer. It was light yet hearty. That squid was huge! The marinara sauce was perfect. We ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and the Spinach Feta pizza. Both were very good. The servers were very kind & we had a great experience. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was okay only. The pizza was mediocre and service was strange to say the least. My boyfriend and I went for lunch, we were the only people there- 3 different servers were rotating coming to check on us, but didn't seem that they communicated to each other who was helping us.  The food took forever. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Really good food, and fantastically friendly service! Natal is a great host, as well as his son. Our families favorites are the clams, the lasagna, and the pizza as well. Superb place to be, and a great, peaceful place to go."}
{"text":"A crew of 12 of us descended upon Joey's at about 7:30p on a Saturday. We called ahead to let them know we were coming in and the could not have been more accommodating! We tried for about an hour and 5 different restaurants to find some place that could seat all of us, without having to wait until 9pm, and Joey's was happy to have us. The specials were amazing, the Lobster Ravioli was delightful! For a party of 12, the service was unbelievably quick, no food lottery or order mix ups. I would definitely head back to try the veal!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but not what I was expecting at all.  California Bisto is what I was wanting, limited menu and all Italian is what I got.  The price was right but that was about it.  It was dead inside and service was slow and without a care, I won't be heading back anytime soon.  On to the next one, until then happy eating."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch, as we just moved to the area.  At first we were leery because there were only two people at the bar and no one in the dining area- and it was lunch time.  However the atmosphere was very inviting and \"Italian\".  MUCH to our surprise, the food was outstanding.  They bake the bread for the sandwiches fresh and the chicken on my pasta was slow roasted over cedar and it was clear the attention to this detail.  Lunch specials were 7-10 dollars too, very reasonable. We hope more people will try this place out, totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and it was so yummy!  We started off with bruschetta that was great. I had the lasagna which was better than my Italian daughter's lasagna! Not a fancy place but the food is worth enjoying."}
{"text":"My first time here. I called my order in. I got to the location and the doors are locked, I though, what the heck!? My phone had rang a few times from an unknown caller, I finally answer. It was the owner calling me back to tell me that he was running late. No biggie, I appreciated the call. As my food was being made, I sat and chatted with the owner for a bit. He was such a genuine, nice person. The food I ordered is amazing (Chicken Parm) and the salad was delicious as well. I would highly recommend Joey's Bistro. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, nice people, good food! Very good gnocchi. Their pizza is probably my favorite item on the menu. Wonderful place to enjoy sporting events. The owner opened @ 9:00 every morning of the World Cup, & offered a full day of food & soccer for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot discovered recently.  The food was delicious & service was outstanding. The owner was super friendly & very warm & accommodating!   Looking forward to going back & trying additional items on the menu."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food in the desert.  Wow and the owner is there every single day and interacts with the customers to ensure a great experience."}
{"text":"The Chicken Parmigiana is the best! I definitely recommend! Very good bread as well! The best part is the customer service. We will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"We have driven by there a million times and never went in. About two months ago decided we would try it.Love it! Food is fresh,service is personable.A great place for two adults or the entire family."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. My mom, daughter and I decided to try it out for dinner. My daughter ordered chicken fingers which were not that great. My mom ordered a chicken rigatoni which the noodles were crunchy and the sauce was bad. I ordered shrimp Alfredo and the shrimp and Alfredo sauce were spoiled. Service was very slow and the food was not edible. We have never sent food back, but tonight was the exception."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new restaurant in my area with some friends. We had a good time. The inside looks like it can be multifunctional. It has an Italian vibe, full bar and a beautiful patio that looks great to sit at on a nice day. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and it was delicious however the wait was longer than I anticipated for it to come out. One of my friends in my party got her food a solid 10 minutes before we did.  Staff is great and they have wonderful customer service"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here almost every Friday night and love it.  They rotate their menu seasonally so there is always something new."}
{"text":"This place has been here for years. Very homey and it's like your in your grandma's kitchen! The owner is usually our server and very pleasent and attentive. There is usually not a lot of people here so you get extra attention which is nice. The food is very good, has good flavor and doesn't take to long. The only problem I have is that he seems to be a bit understaffed so I felt bad asking for bread that would usually come out before the meal. Husand had chicken marsala and it was excellent, I enjoyed my eggpalant. Not a five star place but it's definitely better then Olive Garden or Carrabas!"}
{"text":"Granted New Year's Eve is not the best night to judge. BUT, and that's a BIG BUT.. Service was horrible.  My husband asked for an IPA and the owner didn't even know what an IPA was, didn't come back with suggestions, just brought him a beer, a hefweisen which he hates.  Martini had 3 dinky ordinary olives on a toothpick.  Food took forever, my friend and I split an entree and the kitchen did not split it. After the shredded iceberg lettuce \"salad\" with runny blue cheese dressing, the server asked if I wanted to keep my silverware Later we asked for new utensils and she brought a plate with knives and forks and set it in the middle of the table Asked for a glass of ice water and it NEVER came. I drank the water from the glass of ice I ordered for my martini. The worst thing over all was the lack of attention.. and it was NOT busy!~ IHOP would have probably been better."}
{"text":"Recently relocated here with my family from Florida & been wanting to try out some local spots. Came in last night for a late diner & was greeted by the owner Natale who was very gracious & kind. We started with of course cocktails which I had some Chianti & my hubby chose a tequila sunrise, he liked his drink being that he chose a second one. We started with the calamari & they thankful had the tentacles which are always my fave, the calamari was very good & not greasy at all. For the entrees my hubby had the chicken Marsala with fresh veggies, the chicken was good & tender & the broccoli & carrots were crisp, not over cooked at all. I had the lobster ravioli & it was simple but good & fresh. For desert we tried the cannoli & I had an amaretto being we were having Italian, both were very good & a nice ending to our meal. I really don't understand some of the negative reviews but to eaches own, this restaurant is a refreshing place to go to for a nice casual meal, nothing fancy but good & fresh. FYI it's also very reasonable with prices, trust me we know about overpriced being that we just moved from Miami, Florida!!!"}
{"text":"Joey's was nice family feeling good Italian food. I came for a few brews while waiting for my wifey to get her hair done at the Avalon Salon school down the way from here.   He recommended I try the kronenbourg and it was so perfect I had another, chomping on yummy bruchetta with a mixed green salad thrown in.   To finish it off I had a canoli and cappuccino which together was just wow. About $30 for all that, hmm sure a bit pricey but not unreasonable considering the place seemed to have a great handle on what they were doing, and did it right.  Great Italian vibe, unassuming and friendly, like you would expect in a neighborhood New York place, though it calls itself a California Bistro.   I shall return for dinner sometime soon! Kudos to Emily my waitress and the guy behind the whole works for keeping up on everything during my visit.   If you are looking for cheap grub this is not it, but if you have a desire for authentic Italian in the area, I can imagine no better destination. Impeccable, caring service and not rushed.  Parking is plentiful, easy access from Bell and 7th. No WiFi but I was able to watch the game at the bar, they have  few TVs around though def this is for the people and the eats.   If you have well behaved kiddos they would certainly be welcome, though also romantic enough for couples, and bright enough for casual dinner and drinks with the guys or friends after work."}
{"text":"Again, I am definitely a regular at this place! Last night had the sausage, peppers and onions! The meal was outstanding!  This is a family owned place and the food is awesome!!!!  The restaurant has gotten a new name and an updated interior!!! Don't listen to the negative reviews about service! Natale treats his customers like family!!!!  Always 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"I reviewed Joey's CB once before, and I am updating my review.  The last time I went in w/ my friend and his daughter, waiting for a haircut at Sport Clips around the corner, we were ripped off by Natali.  Not only was I charged for 2 sodas bc I asked for a Sprite instead of Coke (bc it tasted weird and flat), we were also charged $5 to play pool for 2 games we played on a table that was obviously improperly felted.  At no time were we told that playing pool cost money.  When I asked him about it, Silence.  The only reason this place still gets 2 stars is bc the food I have tried is good.  But beware, this individual is prone to charging you for everything he can think of.  I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Had the chicken Parmesan my wife had the spaghetti it was very delicious I took a little time to get the food to the table but the wait was worth it going back to try the pizza"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Joey's California Bistro for several years now. Natale, the owner, is of Italian descent and he hails from New York, as evidenced by his accent. I've had nearly everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. What's served at Joey's is traditional, home-style (if your home is that of an Italian family in New York) Italian cuisine.   Warm bread is always brought to the table before the meal and it is always delicious. They bake the bread on site. Yesterday I had the rigatoni with smoked chicken. The pasta was done just right. The chicken had a nice smokiness to it. But the standout was the sauce. My dining companions had the salmon salad and the greek salad, which they were both pleased with. My companions loved the bread so much, they requested more.  The baked ziti and the tortellini are excellent dishes, as are the chicken cacciatore and the chicken marsala. We often see other neighborhood regulars at Joey's. The regulars can all attest that if you want something that's not on the menu, Natale will accommodate you. One time I went to Joey's with the family and, while everyone else wanted Italian food, I felt like having a burger, which isn't on the menu. No big deal; a burger was made for me and it was delicious.  I noticed that the lunch menu was revised and I believe they have reduced the prices on the lunch items.  I don't know if they've done the same for the dinner menu.  The atmosphere is pleasant.  They have the requisite Italian-themed framed photos of Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Marlon Brando as the Don Corleone, and more.  It's also a good place to eat and drink while watching a baseball or football game or a soccer match on the large screen televisions they have.  Having said that, the volume on the televisions is not loud, so it doesn't interfere with one's dining experience.  You do get attentive service, especially at lunch when the owner is also your server.  They have outdoor seating as well, where those that feel the urge to have a cigarette can go outside and light up.   I believe in supporting our local independent restaurants versus the large chains. Joey's California Bistro is one local independent restaurant that I hope I'll be supporting as a customer for many more years to come."}
{"text":"This place is so unassuming and in a shopping center so you may never really put it on your list of places to go - but you SHOULD. The food is EXCEPTIONAL. The service is always wonderful. This is one of the places that could make it in a high traffic area/snooty location because of the food alone, but it's nice they are a neighborhood favorite. Seriously get the margarita pizza and the fettucini."}
{"text":"On my second visit, yes its empty but I have had a nice dining experience food and atmosphere wise. Restaurant Impossible would love this place."}
{"text":"I have never been here before and seen they were open its about 7pm so I decide to come in. Nobody greeted me I just walk to the bar waited 5 minutes before someone said they will be with me. A guy comes to me and asks if I would like a drink I order a sessions draft and get it 3 minutes later as he goes and checks on another table he comes back I get a draft beer great but it tastes really flat I leave it and was never offered a menu, I helped myself to a menu at the chair next to me. Everything is overpriced and the draft beer is ridiculous so I asked for a bottle and that was better I don't know how this place is still open. I would never eat here and will leave shortly..."}
{"text":"Great food a wonderful find for a quite Friday night.. just ask what's good tonight and order it.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My husband and i were not impressed and will not return. We were surprised as this resturant has been around for a long time. The waiter asked what i wanted to drink but not my husband. The waiter did not know if the sausage was Italian or not. He forgot what i ordered and we were the only ones in the resturant. After our salad was done, the waitress came up and asked if we were ready for our check ...our entrees had not come yet! My husband ordered meat sauce, he got marinara. Over priced!  One couple left when their two wine choices were not in stock. Another customer was angry when bread was delivered to us instead of his.. he was there first, bread tasted like plain white bread. Food was good but not worth the price.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Set out to find some dinner with the fam at 8pm Monday night this place is basically across the street from me now. I thought, well this place has been here for years I've never tried it but there must be something good about it.......right!?!? I thought to myself eh WTH! After arguing with my munchkin to get out of the car for 10 mins because she wanted McDonalds instead (it was in her little 6 yr old view from the car) I finally lured her out with her DsLite! YAY So we walk in and were going to be seated in the dining room but we figured its 8pm the last quarter of the Indi & Miami game was on and the place was pretty empty after a quick glance around. We decided to sit in front of the big screen in the bar area! We made the right choice they have Italian soccer jersey's decorating the bar area and I felt very Italian by the end of the night. The server was excellent I repeat EXCELLENT with a capital E. Sorry I am no good with names and forgot his name but he was a tall Italian with some killer eyes complete with full accent!  Peroni on tap you say!?!?! Score!! We started with some fried mozzarella it was DELICIOUS the marinara was fresh really chunky and tomato-y! The munchkin loved it and they even gave her Sprite in a cocktail glass. Who care's you say??? Well she will remember this for ages she even talked about it at home hours later. \"Mom that was the fanciest glass I've ever had!\" This place made her forget about McD's which I give 2 stars for entirely!!   The bread was nice, it was toasted which the munchkin loved, she said she loves it toasted where its nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside mmmm! Her words not mine. Ultimately the kid felt really comfy at this place where she is usually really shy and non speaking. The only thing with the bread was instead of olive oil they brought out packaged whipped butter which wasn't bad and I probably could have asked for some oil but I'm not really complaining here so fugetaboutit kwim!  The specials that were not on the menu sounded fantastic so we went with them!! After the past weekend and watching Anthony Bourdain in Southeast Asia eating clams I had to have the fresh linguine and clams w/ white sauce. It was DELICOUS!! They will pretty much make any order the way you want it white or red sauce etc. I for one appreciate that aspect. The man had the pork chop stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella with a tasty marsala wine sauce and mushrooms mmmm he only gave up one bite for me but it was choice!  We passed up on dessert but not without the waiter bringing us some shots of their in house homemade limoncello!! OMG just ask how they make it and for some sugar on the rim if you like that sort of thing it was awesome!! That totally topped my night!! I cant wait to go back and try the eggplant parm next! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Ciao Bello/Bella's!!"}
{"text":"We accidentally found this place and we've been going back ever since. I'd love to tell you about the pasta but we never got past the pizza and appetizers. Now when we eat pizza somewhere else we're just disappointed. Every time we go we say we're going to try some thing else, but we've gotten in the habit to go there when we're craving pizza, if it not broke don't fix it, so we get pizza. The owner Nate is friendly and hard working. He just recently change the name of the place to his name Natalino's Italian Restaurant, suits the place so much better. We don't live close, but we tend to migrate here about once a month and every time Nate greets us like we're old friends. If you haven't tried it I recommend giving it a chance."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited on a Wednesday evening. The place was empty, save for a few people at the bar, ourselves included.  I made the comment to my friend that this place gave off a \"Ramsays Kitchen Nightmares\" vibe. He laughed. I worried, because the food hadn't arrived yet.  The manager (at least I'm assuming he was, he wasn't just behind the bar, he was all over the place) was friendly enough. Very nice chap. I'd give him 4 stars on personality if I could rate that here.  The prices are a bit overpriced. I had a simple 8\" Margherita pizza. At $9 for the pizza, that's more than a buck an inch. Normally price isn't an issue IF the food is worth it. It's pretty hard to mess up a pizza as simple as a Margherita. Or so I thought.  The pizza was very bland. They substituted oregano for the traditional basil. This substitute may be acceptable to a lot of you, but not to me. Basil makes a Margherita. In addition, it did not have enough olive oil, and it was a bit cold as well.  The pizza arrived, and as the manager put the plate down, the pizza slid halfway off the plate, and onto the bar. Half the pizza was now sitting on the bar counter. Using the spatula, he tried putting the half that fell onto the bar counter back onto the plate. After pushing the pizza around the bar counter several times trying to scoop it up, he apologized. All I could think to say was - I hope the bar counter was clean. They said it was. I've only their word to take for that.  Did he offer to cook us a new pizza? NOPE. Did he offer a discount on the check? NOPE. A few minutes later, he offered me and my friend each a shot of his homemade Limoncello, on the house. It was sub-par.  I give this place a few more months before they're gone.  And if the owner/manager of Joey's California Bistro is reading this, give Gordon Ramsay a call. Your place would make a great episode. It's just a shame I had the experience of eating in the 'before' version of this place."}
{"text":"Our friend recommended this place and we had a great experience. He seems to be a regular and gets the royal treatment from the owner. The lunch specials were good and fairly reasonably priced. Not sure when we will be back because the location is not very convenient for us, but if you are a big fan of pasta you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Love this cozy little pizza place! You can enjoy a not too pricey candle-lit dinner with family, friends or a hott date! We started with fried mozzarella for an appetizer. It was delicious. It was pretty much a fancy giant mozzarella stick, but better. My husband got the meat lovers pizza and I had the BBQ chicken. We split a half and half pizza but I wish we both would have ordered our own. The pizzas are pretty small, but really good! There's also a bar area with a great selection of wines! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the customer service is one of a kind and the environment was family friendly, I highly recommend this place, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here the other night. We loved the New York feel. Typically when we have Italian, my boyfriend judges the restaurant on their chicken parmigiana. We loved it! We also ordered a margarita pizza which was boasting with flavor as well. Homemade cannoli's to die for. Fantastic owner who works in his restaurant and really cares about his customers! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"What a mistake!   We are relatively new to the area and are always looking for good, local restaurants.  When we arrived, the place wasn't crowded......5-7 tables occupied.  We weren't acknowledged by either the lone server NOR the man who turned out to be a manager or owner.  Both looked at us twice.  There was no sign to seat yourself or wait to be seated.   Both the server AND the manager or owner came over and gave us excuses about how busy they were......NOT.  We told them that it's bad business not to acknowledge customer when they come in.  It's especially bad business when staff makes eye contact with you, ignores you and then makes up excuses.  We got up and left, telling them we would not be back.    Good luck with this place."}
{"text":"Could of gave a 1 star but that that wouldn't be fair because I didn't eat the food. The menu was very small and over priced. I went a Friday night and the restaurant was half dark on one side and half lite on one. He sat my girl and I next to two other tables with people. One a table of 5..your going to crowd all the guests together and dim the other half for your convenience? It felt a little uncomfortable so I dipped my head in the menu to see if that's put a smile on my face. Unfortunately the menu was horrible and overpriced so we both got up and walked out.   Was excited to try this place giving the fact I'm from California and a bistro type of place would be awesome. More like a guido fest ran restaurant that should be called Tony's Titanic, because this place was a shipwreck."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday party.  The party guests were to receive an appetizer, salad and entree for $35/plate.  The appetizers were minimal, the salads were good and the entrees were staggered so some were all done before others had received their entree.  The guests had all ordered their entree from the menu before the party.  There was only one attendant for 18 guests.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Great food & service. We had the Lobster Ravioli and it was well worth the price! My hubby was happy that they had Tillamore Dew! And I liked the wine."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here at the bar with a friend. The place was practically empty, but we both had meals we enjoyed. The conversation with the bartender wasn't so bad.  The booze choices were a bit minimal but mostly decent.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.  Place was pretty empty.  Had the \"wood fired\" pizza which i highly doubt was wood fired.  It tasted like over conveyor basic cooked pizza.  The salad was nothing special.   This place could be great if they improved their food quality using fresh made ingredients and sauces.  Wouldn't go back so 1 star."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been driving by Joey's for two years and last Saturday evening we were in the mood to try someplace new.  I'm always up for trying a new restaurant.  The Adventure! The Curiosity! The excitement!  Oh, lets not get to carried away here.  I'm a pretty decent self-taught chef and my standard is simple: The food had better be at least as good as I can prepare at home.  I had the Rigatoni with smoked chicken in a parmesan cream sauce.  This is a dish that's hard to screw up, and they didn't.  It was fine. But 15 bucks?  We're talking about a few cents worth of pasta, some cream and parmesan, and about a quarter of a chicken breast grilled and tossed in. Easy. Tasty. Not worth $15 hard-earned money. We're talking the same price as Macaroni Grill's Chicken Scaloppine and there is a world of difference between what went in to the two dishes.  My wife had the lasagna. She ate a small portion and asked for a cary-out container.  As we were walking to the car later she said, \"The lasagna was terrible\".  So why did she want to take it home?  \"I dunno\".  At least that gave our son a chance to render a second opinion on it.  Our son, the Army Infantry Fire Team Leader. Chows down MRE's like they are gourmet.  His verdict?  \"Disgusting\"  If you are going to spend fifty bucks on a meal you deserve better than this."}
{"text":"My family has been  frequent customers of Joey's for over 10 years. I just don't understand how anyone could leave this establishment unhappy. Whenever something has not seemed just right, we simply bring it to the owner's attention and he goes overboard to fix it. Here's our favorites: amazing eggplant parmigiana, great pizza,  homemade meatballs ( great to bring home), veal masala, antipasto. Eat in or take away!!   Periodically Joey's offers these delicious clams as a special. My wife says they are the BEST she has ever eaten. If they have them on the menu...order them.   It is also a great place and an affordable spot for a private party."}
{"text":"Just read a good portion of the previous reviews and they seem consistent with my experience. Place was empty on a Thursday night . We ordered the ziti, lasagna and tilapia and the quality of the food was good. Touching on the other reviews I think the issue with spot is how disconnected the staff is and owner trying to do too much. Bartender, waiter, entertainer, etc... I don't think they know what they want to be yet."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to try this place as it is nearby and we always drive by it. It has a very casual vibe, with a bar and indoor dining room seating as well as outdoor patio seating. The staff was all attentive and friendly. However, we waited an extremely long time for our food. They also brought out one entree several minutes before another. The food was very good and tasted fresh. The menu was limited as well, but portions were generous."}
{"text":"Great Italian food at great prices. We had 7 people in our party and everyone loved their meal. Nice quiet place but is good for families with children."}
{"text":"Any time someone asks for a new place to go I immediately refer them to Joeys. We have gone back just about every time we are home. The in-house ice cream is INCREDIBLE. The I've had a few different dishes every time I go and it have yet to be let down. The family atmosphere is wonderful. The owners always come to greet you and ask about your experience. They are so welcoming and just a beautiful place to dine."}
{"text":"Have been here several times over the last couple of years. Every time has been a superior experience. The pasta, sauces, ingredients are cooked to perfection.  Have yet to find anything about the food that was questionable. The place is very clean with a comfortable atmosphere. The owner is very gracious, approachable, and a wiz with sports history. It's great talking about international soccer with him at the bar where there are a couple of TVs."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday after seeing this place it in the neighborhood forever.Figured it had to be good to have lasted as long as it has.  Had to talk hubby into it. Boy, am I ever sorry! Only one other couple at 8:30 on a date night should have been enough to make us leave but I wanted to give them a shot. BIG MISTAKE!!! Order iced tea. $3.00 for a teeny glass, shame on you! Entrees were very high 15.00 + and 20.00 for Veal Parmigiana. Decided to go with the bruschetta. Advertised as Italian bread with garlic, olive oil, tomato and basil. The bread was toasted white sandwich bread, the tomatoes were there,and  the garlic, basil and olive oil must have been in hiding as they were non-existant! When the owner (I am assuming owner, as no sane CEO would let an idiot like this work in their business) asked how the food wasI let him know just what was wrong, starting with sandwich bread?!?!? He tried to convince me it was their fresh baked bread and went as far as to bring a very large flat tray with a small square corner cut from it telling me this was what I had eaten. No way I could have made that mistake! He became very insistent, then arrogant and finally nasty telling us to \"Get the fuck out\". Quote unquote When hubby took offense, the little 5'something owner told 6'1\" hubby he would make him leave. Needless to say, we won't be back. Now I understand why there never are cars there though not why  it has occupied the location for many years. I only wonder if the Maggiore family is financing this fiasco so 'Napoleon' can play at running a Bistro (Yeah, right!) and leave the rest of the family's businesses alone. Good idea! Went to Cuccina Tagliani on 59th Ave & Bell and got real Italian food and were treated as a customer should."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic restaurant!!! The service was friendly and good! The salmon was excellent and so was the chicken Marsala! We would definitely come back as it is one of the best tasting Italian restaurants that we have been to!"}
{"text":"Can't understand all the criticism present.   The staff was attentive and incredibly friendly. The owner introduced himself as well and spoke about the home made dishes.   Everything was as described and tasted phenomenal. The smoked chicken rigatoni was incredible."}
{"text":"Sausage pizza was amazing. So delicious!!! Plenty of cheese and sauce and perfectly cooked. Mozerella is the perfect appetizer. The marinara to dip is great. The shrimp Alfredo was a big let down. Warm milk and noodles and fishy shrimp. Didn't eat it at all. Ordered take out or I would have sent back. Otherwise though it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great service! Had the calamari. It was light and tasty. Wood fired pizza is the best. Crust is great!"}
{"text":"I must admit that I'm a bit of a regular here. My husband, daughter and I have been coming here for years. Usually, my daughter and I split a pizza while the hubby gets pasta.  The pizzas are amazing--well balanced sauce with a crispy, buttery crust.  The pastas (especially the Aurora sauce and the baked ziti) are delicious!  On a recent trip, however, I went out of my norm and ordered the salmon salad. Amazing!  The salad was cold, crisp and fresh...nicely dressed with a light Italian vinaigrette. The salmon was warm and cooked perfectly--the perfect balance to the cold salad.  The owner is always present, making sure that Quality Control is key.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  When in doubt, try it!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I tried Joey's on a Friday night for the first time around 8:30 for dinner. It seems like a fancy misfit in the midst of the Safeway shopping center, and I was never sure just how I should be dressed before I walked inside. On this particular night we saw a small group walking into the restaurant dressed as though they were headed for the swap meet, so we took that as a sign that we'd have no trouble being seated in our flip flops and tees, though I still felt a bit underdressed once inside. Short and to the point:  Friendly staff Good service Authentic recipes Reasonably priced Dress up or dress down Very quiet - where are all of the other patrons? Baked Ziti (enough for two and oh so delicious) comes with a side salad for $13.00 Great Tiramisu a block from my house? Huzzah! Relaxed, comfortable, fresh flowers and candlelight on the tables equals nice ambiance. Incredibly attentive, because there's hardly anyone else there? No, really, why aren't people flocking to this place? Music volume is a little low for my taste...and 80's was it? Italiano would be lovely. That's why I just can't give Joey's a final star.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Joeys, esp. if you are looking for some place quiet.  Whenever I have been in there my guests and I are the only ones in the place. I actually spent my 21st birthday dinner here. The owner is really nice and remembers my name each time I'm there, in fact he is almost always the person who takes my order.  I do agree that the prices should come down a bit..  The service will keep me coming back. I don't really get the creepy vibe that the other reviewers got but then again I didn't take the vegetarian house as a cult either.. Its excellent for dates you actually want to talk to, its been a cure for the restaurants that I can't even hear my guest speak. I must say, if you do go and enjoy liquor try the lemon cello. The owner makes it from scratch and its even better when you dip cannolis in it."}
{"text":"We know Italian and this place is excellent in the food section! We ordered the angel hair pasta with clams and the spaghetti and meatballs plate, it was wonderful. The bread before dinner was okay but my Caesar salad made up for it. I gave the restaurant four stars because we felt the manager was in hurry for everyone to leave, he even turned off the register light."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a pasta dishs, baked ziti, and a pizza.  Both were delicious.  The home made bread was out of this world. There were not too many customers,  so the service was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My GF and I went to Joey's after driving by it for years, but never taking the plunge.  To say we were shocked when we stepped insided was a mucho understatement-o.  The fucker was empty.  It was a wednesday night,  and it was kinda early (6:30pm)  but I expected more than just us and the smattering of blue hairs that were seated.   I don't wanna come off as an ass hat; the staff was super friendly, but this  place was downright C R E E P Y - some would say the decore inside was dated , I'd say  it felt like I was sitting in my grandma's living room.  The lights were off in half the restuarant ( that's not good) , and the A/C  was on the fritz . (or they don't believe in a/c?)   It wasn't swelteringly hot inside, but whaterver cooling system they had running could not keep my swamp ass at bay :(     Lastly, the the food. While hot and ressembling standard issue italian chow, was off in a \"alternate dimension kinda\" way.   Like a Bizzaro Pizza.  Yeah.   I  felt oogy after I ate it.   Avoid the regular ice tea, it's olive flavored. olive."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in North Phoenix!  Everything we have ordered from Joeys has be outstanding!  Can't say enough about the pizza and pasta dishes."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful neighborhood gem.  The pizza crust and the focaccia are made in house daily.  Some of the daily specials are hand rolled in house as well.  The owner Natale is always on site and very welcoming.  I had the housemade cannelloni  with spinach and beef topped with vodka sauce.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great cozy non-chain Italian. Very warm and friendly staff. I especially love and appreciate they cook the noodles al dente. I hate this squishy noodles you get at most chain restaurants. The soups are always clean and bright and you can tell they are made from scratch. I tend to get the spaghetti and meatballs because it's spaghetti and meatballs darn it! If you can't make a decent sauce and something as uncomplicated as spaghetti and meatballs well and you shouldn't be any Italian business. These guys should definitely be in the Italian business! The owners usually around and comes by for a quick friendly chat. I recommend it for a nice family night, and an affordable dinner or a nice casual date night."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch service is fast and the guy is very kind! Made it an easy lunch break fast enough so I coukd have a healthy lunch and get back to work I'll come back.  Food needs a little bit more seasoning but good option"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Owner is always there talking to customers and creating an inviting atmosphere. I've been taking my family here since I moved to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great restaurant food and service are always consistent. Great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe here. Joey and his wife are amazing hosts. The food is good. I've had some great dishes. Pasta Fazol was really good. Nice little Italian spot. Good for date night. Loved the ambiance and the service."}
{"text":"The food is always so fresh and beyond delicious! Very authentic cooking and I absolutely love the baked ziti. This  place is a family fave!"}
{"text":"I reluctantly sent my overworked husband to Joey's to bring home a carryout of chicken piccata and chicken Parmesan. First of all, the meals were freezing cold, bland, and the piccata had no lemon taste whatsoever. We had three bites and threw the food away :("}
{"text":"Holy shit.  Where do I begin?   First off, \"Joey's California Bistro Italian Restaurant\"? Isn't that like, \"Mandy's Apparel Shop Store for Clothes\"?  The place was mostly empty, save for terrible, dated decor and a smattering of rather lively and vivacious flies. A waiter was screaming at a customer from the other side of the restaurant. Even when I realized they were screaming sports-oriented things, it still wasn't normal. As our waiter wheezed the specials of the day to us, we feared he was literally about to die in the middle of the word \"stuffed\".  Our salads consisted of romaine, three pieces of cucumber, and one tomato, cut in half. The bleu cheese dressing contained no actual cheese. I ordered tea with lemon and honey, but the honey was a \"blend\" made out of mostly high fructose rice syrup... is honey too rare a commodity to hunt down these days? Our dinner companion ordered lobster ravioli with shrimp. The waiter brought the lobster ravioli out, then the shrimp, separately, in a little cup. Oh, and the shrimp was BOILED. What is this, 1965? What the actual f*#&.  It'd be one thing if this place was dirt cheap, but entrees hit well over $20.  Do yourself a favor. Rather than coming here, just eat the money. Even if it's in coins."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Moon Valley and had driven past Joey's for the past few months. Tonight I was having dinner with my adult son, so we decided to give it a try. When we walked up, they had a chalk board outside with the specials listed (with no prices). Beware! I ordered the chicken Marsala. It was a generous portion of chicken; however, the sauce tasted canned and it had rubbery canned mushrooms. It was not worth the $17 price for such an average meal. My son ordered the stuffed shells off the chalkboard outside. He got three stuffed shells in a meat sauce. We each got a very \"diner-like\" dinner salad with some lettuce, a couple of grape tomatoes, and three slices of cucumber. Nothing special at all. The iced tea tasted funny, too. I didn't ask how much the stuffed shells cost when my son ordered them. I was SHOCKED to see that this \"special\" was $18 for three stuffed shells!!  I will say that on the good side the staff is fantastic. We were well attended throughout our meal, so I left a good tip. But $50 is ridiculous for such a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"What a nice little place.  We came here on  a Sunday and the owner was very friendly.  The food was very tasty.  We both got the alfredo tortelinis and they were very cheesy and very creamy.  Add fresh parmesan and it was delicious.  The bread and salad were fresh and tasty as well.  The 14 hands Merlot we got ($26 for a bottle) was a decent price and went down smooth.  They had a big flat screen TV where we watched the Jets/Cowboys Sunday night game.  The owner is from New York so that made it more fun.  He even gave us free sh0ts just for being awesome! Good times."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after the gym last night. It was a Friday night at 8pm and their \"dinner service\" consisted of 4 tables. You could practically hear crickets chirping it was such a wasteland. I think I may have seen a tumbleweed roll by. The staff stood around looking bored out of their skulls. The manager/owner was some macho, guido New Yorker who kept talking to the customers while they tried to eat. Even though the restaurant sucked you could tell he was super proud of it as well as the menu the way he beamed with pride after each dish that was brought out. I guess it makes himself feel better to tell himself these things so he can get to sleep at night. I'm still not even sure who our server was that night, as we had four different people coming up to our table asking if we needed anything else and clearing dishes.  We ordered mozzarella sticks, garlic bread, chicken Parmesan and the tortellini. The mozzarella sticks were served with marinara sauce in one of those silver gravy dishes. Weird. Everything was sub-par. As Gordon Ramsay would say it was \"Bland. Boring. Uninspiring.\" Not to mention overpriced. The bill was $50. Carraba's is better and less expensive.   The decor and furniture is garage sale-chic. There's soccer balls displayed in the bar. The chairs were made of wicker and bamboo. It looked like The Golden Girls had a yard sale. There was also a broken big-screen tv from 1996 sitting in the dining area.   I feel sorry for the owner. He seemed very delusional and desperate. I hope for his sake the place closes soon."}
{"text":"Lived in the area for years and never came in before. So glad I  did. Everything was amazing.  We had calamari that was perfectly fried, a pizza with a great crust and an excellent rigatoni with smoked chicken. We will definitely be back to check out the rest of the menu. YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE!!"}
{"text":"The staff if very nice. I got a salad to go and was disappointed when I got home. There was spring mix with maybe one tomato 3 slices cucumber halved and one (yes that is correct) one piece of cheese. This salad was $10. It tasted nice but wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"Entering the restaurant I was welcomed with a warm smell of delicious food.  The atmosphere was very cute.  I'd imagine this place probably looks adorable at Christmas time.  Sadly I was disappointed with my meal.  I got the special: tilapia and artichokes in a lemon sauce with steamed vegetables on the side.  The tilapia was mediocre.  Fishier than normal for tilapia. My friend tried it and thought so too. I'm willing to give this place another shot,  so I'll likely be back.  As of my experience tonight I have nothing to rave about."}
