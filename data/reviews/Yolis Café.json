{"text":"Looking for breakfast or lunch? Eat here. Cafe food with a Yoli twist."}
{"text":"While the food was good (but not remarkable), the service was really poor. We arrived around 10 on a Tuesday...waited 15 minutes for a table (no big deal) then another 25 for someone to take our order, then another 30 to get our food.  It was fine for breakfast, but I hadn't planned to spend over an hour before I ate. Also, we were on the patio, which seemed like a good idea since the weather was nice; however, the birds squawking from next door were unnerving and leaves and stuff from the trees were falling in our food.  Not worth the drive or the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, fast service, friendly people. Don't miss this mom and pop place, we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, great service, neat atmosphere.  This place has the best French Toast!  Great for families.  Plenty of choices to satisfy even the picky eaters.  Good coffee, too. Great experience.  Will be back to try the Monte Christo!"}
{"text":"Love it.  Really good food and nice people.  Check out the courtyard."}
{"text":"I recently moved to AZ and wanted to try a local spot. I got on yelp and found this place and it was a pleasant surprise. Great breakfast and lunch that you can tell everything is homemade. The pancakes are awesome, the homemade jelly is equally fantastic. I also recommend the build a burger option for lunch, they have great options like chorizo. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. I had the chance to meet yoli herself and she was extremely nice and outgoing! She even sat down and talked to us and shared her story. Me and my family are now regulars, even when my parents come in from out of town this is the first place they want to go."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant - great, fresh, delicious food, and wonderful customer service.  I would recommend this place to everyone!  The only drawback is that it's a tiny hole in the wall...with limited indoor seating.  But the food and service make it worthwhile to visit."}
{"text":"Two words... Mouth watering!!! The Volcano style was AMAZING. Can't wait to make another trip to Yoli's cafe. Yummo!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for breakfast! I always sit on the patio and bring my dog. The waitstaff is always friendly to me and my dog. My favorite thing in the menu is the green egg and ham omelette. I get their potatoes as a side and they're delicious, flavorful and homemade. My boyfriends loves to add their cheddar biscuit to his order. It is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great home town cafe atmosphere. Patio seating is great when the weather is nice.  The best pancakes I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"The Corned beef Hash at this place was amazing! I gave Yoli's a 2 star rating because of the poor service I've received. The waitresses and bus boy passed by 4-5 times without asking how we were doing or asking if we needed a refill. I had to flag down a waitress for a refill and received attitude \"what do you want\". Once I received my drink it was slammed on the table. She also left our empty cups on the extremely small table that we had. I will NEVER come back to this place again.  FYI made this YELP account just to express my concern/annoyance about this place. Please do not waste your time here"}
{"text":"Awesome little gem in the same plaza as The Perch. The owners will make you feel like family, and the chorizo is the best in town. They're always accommodating, especially for little ones who can be impatient with the fresh made to order dishes. Yoli has even whipped up incredible stuff for us when we tell her what we're craving. It's nice to see people who truly care about their community be successful, and we always support them!"}
{"text":"I love this place to death because the food is great and the staff is super friendly BUT for the life of me, the food takes forever every single time we come. Even during a normal rush. I wish they can fix that because then it would be the perfect breakfast location. I just cant come here if I'm hungry because i cant wait that long any more. Please fix this Yoli because i love it here."}
{"text":"Stopped in by chance with my husband for lunch and it was DELICIOUS. I was pleasantly surprised because I'm a very picky eater. I had a yummy turkey blt with fries and hubby had steak sandwich, which he said was made with very good meat.  We definately plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is really cute and very relaxing.  My boyfriend and I split a few things.  The skillet meal and bagel sandwich were great.  The french toast was ok.  The staff was nice.  We will surely go back."}
{"text":"Good biscuit but I like the chorizo burrito my boyfriend ordered better. It had more flavor and \"kick to it\". Staff was friendly and I enjoyed sitting out in the patio. Nice place to have brunch."}
{"text":"Hours are limited which sucks because I would def go more often. Outdoor seating area is fun and welcoming. Food is good and staff are friendly. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I love the food (aside from the green eggs and ham omelette.) My only issue is the noise. The size of the place is part of the issue, but generally the employees are loud and the place just seems to encourage a very \"barking\" atmosphere. Very tasty, but I'd like to see them work on creating an ambience to match the food."}
{"text":"So... I was pretty excited about going here as it had great reviews... But I must say, I was a little disappointed by the food and the service.  Two of us went, and although it was a Saturday, we were seated pretty quickly. We both ordered hot chocolate, which was regular. Nothing fancy about it.   A little bit later, the server took our food order, and we got the veggie breakfast skillet, and a side of French toast. The French toast was pretty good, but the skillet was seriously lacking flavor. It definitely tasted fresh, but lacked all types of seasoning.   We ordered a sandwich to go as well, and it too was pretty regular. For the seasonings alone, the place lost a star in my opinion. The reason why it lost another star was because the food took FOREVER to come out. I'm talking like 35-40+ minutes on the first group of meals, and maybe 25+ for the egg and cheese on a bagel. It bothered me too that the waitress didn't check on is, or even stop by just to let us know our food was taking longer than expected.  I got 10% off discount that I forgot to use at checkout, but I don't see myself going back to cash in on it. Too bad because the place really has tremendous potential, and  I love mom and pop places like this one."}
{"text":"My wonderful \"foodie\" friend took me here for breakfast.  All I can say is, after having the steak breakfast burrito, I'll never set foot in an I-Hop or Denny's again...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great breakfast and great service. Little place that's slightly hidden, but a great little spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"I give this business 0/5 stars. ( I had to put 1/5 to post this review) I went there this past weekend to have breakfast with my daughter. When I walked in the lady had told me 20-25mins for a table, I was fine with that. She then processed to help the guests behind me and had quoted them 15-20 mins and there where more people in their party. I was a bit confused, never the less I still waited. I then noticed that she seated a party of 2 people that had just walked in and didn't even put their name on the waiting list. I also saw that she sat the party that walked in after me first. She also sat another party of 2 people that just walked in and never waited. When I went to ask about my spot on this list, she walks away and acts busy for a few mins. Then ignores me and helps another couple standing at the counter. When she does help me she says, Oh your next I'm just waited for someone to clean the table. Now I understand this place is small and very busy. But this is the worst customer service I have ever gotten anywhere. I have worked in the hospitality industry for a long time and have seen so many different things, but I must say this has been by far the worst. I didn't end up staying and I  won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Staff was very friendly. Sausage gravy is worth having your cardiologist on speed dial. :)"}
{"text":"Great food and the service is always fast and friendly.. The skillets are great, but I love the green eggs n ham omelet."}
{"text":"Food was good. I had the cheddar biscuits and gravy and scrambled eggs. I was skeptical about a cheddar biscuit with gravy, but it was SO GOOD.  I went through the week and it wasn't busy at all, but I hear the weekends are very busy. My only complaint was a weird urine smell coming from The Perch, which sits next door to Yoli's. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pancakes and french toast are a delight. The natural ambiance around the trees and birds reminds us of a resort we had been to earlier."}
{"text":"We found Yoli's Cafe searching for locally owned breakfast joints in Chandler and based on the reviews we decided to try it. We went on Sunday around 11am. The Cafe looks like an old house that was converted into a small restaurant and there is a garden growing in the courtyard. The place is small, clean, and cute   We were able to be seated immediately but we ended up waiting an hour for our food. This normally might seem like a con, but once you get the food on a busy Sunday morning you know exactly why. It is fresh, hot, and delicious!   Best breakfast I have had out in a very long time. I had the Garden Skillet with Country Potatoes & cinnamon raisin toast. My boyfriend had the Chorizo buritto.  The skillet had fresh veggies, fluffy eggs, and fresh country potatoes. It was YUMMY! The cinnamon raisin toast was so good! My boyfriend stole a piece because it was that tasty. His chorizo burrito had hash browns in it and he said it was amazing, one of  best he has had. We also had Mexican cokes in the bottle. Yea real sugar!   My only criticism was that I wished we would have known how long it would take to get our food, an update at 45 mins or so I think would have helped. Once the food did come though, I forgot about any impatience! Our waitress said Sunday is there busiest day.   The price was fair. Breakfast for two was $20. We will be back repeatedly."}
{"text":"Ok, we came here for a late lunch. Definitely need to try the b-fast instead. We had the pulled pork & the shroom burger. The pulled pork is one thing that she's known for. The flavor of it is great, but the pork itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked. I love the kick in it though. They usually serve it on a roll, but the day we had it we had it on a bun. That was dee-lish. The bread was sweet and light. Me likes :)   The shroom burger was favored by both of us. Try it! I appreciate that the server double checked with us and made sure that we knew that the shroom burger was actually just a portobello mushroom and not a hamburger w/shrooms. We knew, but I thought it was a kind gesture.   I'm determined to come back and try the breakfasts though! If it wasn't for that, I'm not sure I love it enough to come more often."}
{"text":"The breakfast was scrumptious.  I had them add green chiles to my skillet. If you want a hearty and delicious breakfast this is the place. Will definitely come back to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"The place has a pretty neat \"hole in the wall\" vibe which is nice, however my experience with the food wasn't all that awesome.  I got their \"famous\" homemade cheddar biscuits, volcano style with chorizo and eggs. The taste was ok, but the texture was way off. The biscuits were really dense, not fluffy like you'd expect. The chorizo was super greasy and had the look and texture of Taco Bell meat. And the eggs, I got over medium, we're not cooked properly (though I get sometimes over medium is subjective) My wife got the chorizo omelette, again swimming in grease.  I'll say this though, the portions are big for the price. It's definitely affordable, just not that tasty imho."}
{"text":"Closed until the 14th of July and nothing was posted until we drove all the way out there! Neighborhood looks a bit shady and I would definitely not come here at night!"}
{"text":"The skillets are amazing!  Breakfasts are my favorite and this is one of my favorite places for that.  Yoli's is actually run by Yoli."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! Perfect day to sit on the patio. The carne Asada burrito was one of the best breakfast burritos we have ever had! Local spot!! We love that!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and took all my friends and out of town visitors, but the service has gotten so poor i won't go there anymore. They've also made the portions smaller and are Nickle and diming everything. Last time I was there I was charged for the creamer on the table because I asked for more--it's too bad. Won't go there again and will not recommend this place to anyone unless you're have all the time in the world and don't care how much they charge you extra."}
{"text":"Today (10/13/12) was my very first experience of Yoli's. I would like to start by making it clear that the food was delicious, the servers were fantastic and the atmosphere was quaint and comfortable. I was geared up to provide a 4 or 5 star rating. The only disappointment of the experience was the wait for my breakfast. I waited an hour from the time I ordered to the time I finally got my meal. I appreciated our server - she was so nice. She apologized and checked on us regularly. Unfortunately, that time period is just unacceptable to me, especially for breakfast. I'll try Yoli's again for all of the other \"pros\". Hopefully, I won't have the same experience."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best breakfast place in chandler!! Food and service was amazing. Will be our new bfast place!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Cozy, and fresh food!  Went there last week and it was great!"}
{"text":"First time here and everything was amazing. What a wonderful little gem we found in this place. Looks like not much out front but it's very charming and original in back. Beautiful patio and food was fabulous. Lunch today but we will be back to try more.  Breakfast looks incredible. Plus, they are Detroit Tiger fans!  Added bonus!!!"}
{"text":"If you want really good breakfast or brunch food this is definitely a hidden gem. You would never tell driving up to the front, but this place does it right. I believe Yoli does all of the cooking so when it gets busy, be prepared to be patient. They share an awesome courtyard with another new place called the Perch Brewery and they have a bunch of rescued exotic birds. Our daughters love to come to this place just to see the birds, but the real reason we keep going back is the food. The service is good as well, but don't forget you may have to wait for a table and then be patient for your food...it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Such a fun, small, house-turned-restaurant hidden in downtown Chandler. Great food. Good service. Not too many tables, though, so there is always a wait. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to stop for breakfast because of the reviews.  So glad we did. We were immediately welcomed and seated. The server was delightful and we told her it was our first visit. She took the time to go through the most popular dishes. We went with the Morning Monte and the Corned Beef Hash.  Delicious!  We will definitely go back next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"We love this place and Yoli. Yoli came and sat with us while we ate. Her food is amazing! It has been our go to for over a year. Great little hidden gem in downtown Chandler. Highly recommend this place! Our kids love Yoli and always want her to come with us when we leave. Haha"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is great and the ladies that work there and own it I assume, are so nice and friendly they make you feel right at home. It has now become one of my regular stops. Support your local cafes and quit going to the chains of restaurants."}
{"text":"Great place to start your day with family or with friends for breakfast/brunch. Great service and super you may food!!!  Love the atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem! New favorite breakfast place! Food and service is exceptional! Recommend the cheddar biscuits and gravy volcano style and vanilla iced coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome. Did I say awesome? My family and I love this place, we always bring out-of-towners that visit here and they love it too. The friendliest staff EVER and the owner is very down to earth and outgoing as well. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Yoli's several times and had a great experience during those visits.  Today on Memorial Day, I went to have breakfast there and you could tell their waitering staff was undermanned.  I had the corned beef hash and eggs over medium with a coffee.  My cup went empty a couple of times and I had to wait for a while each time to get refilled.  I understood since they seemed understaffed.  When I got my breakfast I first noticed that there really wasn't much corned beef in the corned beef hash, but mostly potatoes.  It was salty and the food had an egg stink to it.  I tried the eggs and they were undercooked and had a funny smell to it as well.  I pushed the plate away from me and closer to the edge of the table to indicate there was something wrong.  One of the girls running the pay counter brought us our bill about 2 minutes after we got our food.  She saw that my plate was full and pushed to the edge but just walked off.    My waitress comes by much later into the dining experience and asks as if irritated, \"What's wrong with it?\"  I thought she might even take a bite of it herself and shove back at me saying \"tastes fine to me!\"  She took the plate away in disgust and didn't even ask if I'd like it remade or another item.  The same girl who dropped off the first bill came by just as impersonally as before and dropped off the check with my food order removed, but no comp for my coffee.\"  I went up to the cashier to save time and it's the girl who dropped off the check.  She has the nerve to ask me, \"Did you enjoy your meal?\"  Really?!!!?!  I told her bluntly, \"No, I did not.\"  I don't know what happened to this place, but my previous experiences here were very friendly and just what you'd expect from a mom and pop establishment.  I'm disappointed and don't feel comfortable bringing my family here again."}
{"text":"For the price this place is great! Ordered the breakfast burrito and it was an equal portion of eggs, potatoes, and veggies. It was also a LARGE burrito so you can easily split it with someone if you're looking for something light. Not necessarily a unique burrito but it hit the spot."}
{"text":"You'll wait a while on a Saturday or Sunday morning, but it's worth it! I suggest The Breakfast Monte sandwich-- with egg whites, bacon, turkey, and cheese pressed between two pieces of french toast! Amazing! Service is a bit slow, but it's such a relaxed atmosphere at this place, it really didn't bother us much at all."}
{"text":"I find the apology from the owner, a little different than the e-mail he actually sent me on march 5th. I'll let you decide... Hi Teddy,  rick s. has sent you a message on Yelp:  Your Review  \"Teddy I do appreciate your feedback, however there are 3 sides to every story yours, ours, and the truth..Yoli explained the situation to me as it escalated after she came out to talk to you and your friend.. I do agree that our server was inappropriate with the comment she made referring to you and your friend being Loud and Making a Scene in Public, nothing to do with being gay, how would she even know? Yoli says that your friend repeatedly told her you waited 10 mins not 15..Maybe the wait was to long for your taste since you were really hungry. It was a beautiful morning and enjoying the patio and the beautiful garden it what people do. Possibly taking the other tables order was an oversight, You stated that since you waited to long you were going to leave and not pay your bill for the coffee, that Teddy is theft and you would never do that if you where in a store and the line was too long so you just walk out with a drink, right? The server more than wanted to accommodate you after you made a fuss, including my wife. Regardless if there were 3 tables or 30 tables full, learn to have patience. Yoli was busy in the kitchen helping make 2 large to-go orders, many things you don't know happen in a restaurant. We both have Family and Friends that are part of the LGBT community and we nor our employees would ever discriminate against anyone. The whole new level of 2nd class citizen was really Amplified by your friend calling my wife a Wetback which you failed to mention in your review. He should be ashamed of his actions. We care about and even love our customers which you could still be, as we invite you and your friend back for breakfast or lunch and we both can make some apologies and have a better day. Please respond when you have had time to read this and maybe cool off. Thanks Rick and Yoli\""}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast meals I have ever had.  If you are in the area, hit this one up.  I will go back every time. Rock on!"}
{"text":"First let me say that this place is hidden yet, very popular amongst the locals; there was plenty of street parking upon arrival but, close to nothing once we left. The venue is reminiscent of a small house that one's grandmother or great-grandmother may have owned. We arrived around 10:20 am and was advised of a 20-30 min wait; more like 45 to an hr. For that I give them 4 stars as they are a but unorganized.  A new restaurant (The Perch) opened a few weeks ago and they share a courtyard with Yoli's which, could be both good and bad. Yoli's is quite small and it appears that the property lines for both restaurants is very awkward; there are a few tables for The Perch that are right next to and surrounding tables for Yoli's Cafe. This might be ok PRIOR to The Perch opening at 11 am but, anytime near that, they have no problem kicking you out. Both restaurants should work together to work this out as it could potentially cause customer service issues.  The food was reasonably priced, I'd return."}
{"text":"Order the Mornin Monte and you won't be disappointed.   Took some family that was in town for Spring Training here on a Friday morning. The staff was extremely friendly and there was no wait for an outdoor table.   Everyone really enjoyed their food. I ordered the Mornin Monte which was amazing. Probably the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had. The Spicy Marmalade is what really took it to the next level for me. It was so good."}
{"text":"Local, Fresh and Friendly. More like walking into your own dining room. Except no pots and pans to clean up afterwards.  Locally sourced foods and prepared with with loving care. The waitress is always friendly and helpful in what to order. Small menu but enough variety to come back every week and not be bored by the selections. Owner is around and checking on the food. SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL MOM AND POP RESTAURANT ! Go and have a good Breakfast or Lunch. You will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"So here I am sans family and not a clue where to go and what to eat, so like the rest of us: HELP YELP!!??  Found this hidden gem in Chandler and definitely would recommend it!  The staff is friendly, helpful, and ready to work!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!! I highly recommend the Mornin Monte! The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting and our server Sherry was wonderful! I'll definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"This is my best breakfast restaurant in chandler! I do the scrambled egg whites(they charge extra for egg whites), wheat toast, country potatoes, and French toast for less than 10$ can't compete with that!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, loud & crummy ambience & mediocre food. It took 1 1/2 hours to get get an order of french toast, not worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to Yoli's for a late breakfast with some friends last weekend. We wanted to go eat someplace that wasn't the usual Denny's/Ihop/Good Egg. This place was a nice change. It's a quaint hole in the wall joint on a little side street in downtown Chandler.   I had the Monte which was a great breakfast sandwich of ham, Havarti cheese and an egg (I had mine scrambled) between Hawaiian milk bread French toast and lightly dusted with powdered sugar. They give you this spicy marmalade on the side and when you spread it on the sandwich, it gives it a nice flavor. Really tasty, definitely recommend.  My friends had the chorizo skillet that had country potatoes, an egg, cheese and chorizo. They serve pico on the side along with tortillas. They really enjoyed it. Good food, easy on the bank!"}
{"text":"Call ahead to reserve a table as weekends can be super packed. Yoli's is dog friendly so you'll find us here with our pup enjoying breakfast on the patio. Try one of the skillets or omlettes...huge portion size and enough to share. If you have a sweet tooth, be sure to try the Hawaiian French toast....delicious!!"}
{"text":"First time in Arizona, and Yoli's received a high recommendation. Boy did it come through!  We went there on our first day in town, and loved it so much we went back three times!  Ordered the Veggie Omelette with home fries and corn tortillas. The veggies are grilled to perfection and stuffed inside a huge pocket of fresh eggs. Eggs were cooked perfectly each time, and I'm a stickler for over-cooked(burnt) eggs in omelettes. The avocado on top was the perfect west-coast addition for me.   Home fries were grilled perfect and not burnt.   And to top it all, take a fork full of omelette and home fries and pile it into a fresh corn tortilla. I'm drooling thinking about it.   Plus, when you come from freezing cold winters in Ohio, eating a casual breakfast outside is just what the doctor orders to cure the winter blues.  We came during the weekday, so we were not in a rush for anything. Since the place is small, I could see it getting pretty packed on the weekends. well worth the wait!  I will be visiting Arizona again next month, and can't wait to make it back to Yolis!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a breakfast sandwich. Stumbled across Yolis while getting work done on my car around the corner. Friendly server and got to meet Yoli herself. Nice to see the actual owner is cooking up the great food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great ambience! If you're in during breakfast, have the morning monte. If you want something spicy instead, try the chorizo - it's fresh and flavorful, and one of the best I've tried!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is really good. This is not fast food so dont come in a hurry. The french toast is crispy outside, soft inside just right. I kind of want some right now. Omletes are really tasty, get it with chorizo and you will not be dissapointed at all."}
{"text":"Reminds me of eating at Grandma's kitchen farm, except that it tastes more like a Denny's.  the scrambled eggs were terrible and just basic wonder bread toast.  Much better in the local vicinity."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our breakfast here.  My french toast was great (not soggy), the coffee was good, everyone else enjoyed the breakfast.  Our favorite part was the little communal garden and sitting outside.  The kids had a great time walking around the garden, looking at the plants, sculptures and the birds.  Our waitress was wonderful and we appreciated the Yelp deal.    Just note my tip - from the outside, looks like a residential block, but the restaurant is in the back in the quaint courtyard."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in Chandler for breakfast!  The service is excellent.  The food is tasty and filling.  I love their Hawaiian French Toast.  It is the best french toast in the valley.  It's our favorite place for breakfast."}
{"text":"On fathers day, I had tried to find a new place to take my family to eat. I had never heard of this place, and it seems like it came out of no where! I called and got a reservation for the next hour. On our way to the cafe, I had no idea what to expect. Turns out the cafe is inside a house in a pretty shabby neighborhood. Immediately, everyone was a little hesitant. If it wasn't for all the good reviews, I'm not too confident we would've tried it out. The atmosphere is pretty cool! It's like sittin in somebody's kitchen! Their menu has many things to choose from and it's all fairly priced. My father got a skillet, and let me tell you. It was huge! My dad is a big man, and this was the first time he had to get a to go box. Their biscuits and gravy are FABULOUS! As well as the Hawaiian french toast. (made with Hawaiian sweet bread) it tastes like butterscotch! The only reason I didn't rate it 5 was due to the hour long wait for our food. It was fathers day and they seemed a little hectic. This place has potential to become something huge!"}
{"text":"Yoli's catered our training yesterday and it was amazing. Attention to detail is an understatement. Each item even had a table tent describing what it was. Everything was taken care of from drinks (hibiscus lemonade & iced tea w/ a variety of sweeteners and fresh slides lemons) to dessert. And it was delicious! I thought the pulled pork and Hawaiian chicken salad would be the highlight, as I have had both several times at their restaurant. But I was absolutely blown away by the brownies w/ a melted carmel in eat one. Having the owners deliver, set-up and assure everything was perfect was the icing on the cake. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been here only once for a midweek brunch and the biggest complaint that I have was that the service pretty bad, though the food wasn't.   We arrived at around 10 am and were seated by a young boy, maybe 12 years old. Roughly 15 minutes later, another 12ish year old boy took our drink order, which took another 10 minutes to arrive. Finally, about half an hour into our stay, the actual server (who I thought was a customer because she was sitting with a group a few tables away), comes and does that thing some places do where the server sits down at your table and chats while taking your order. That isn't something I normally mind, it's just a little irritating when you've been waiting for a half hour to order.   Things picked up from there. I had a carne asada burrito and my husband had a bagel sandwich of some kind. Both were serviceable if not particularly memorable. It's actually a very nice patio seating area so if you have to wait at least you have something to look at. Also, next door is some kind of a bird themed restaurant or bar, so all through our meal we could hear the birds loudly squawking and their keepers attempting to get the birds in their cages. Some people might not have enjoyed that part but we found it very entertaining."}
{"text":"The parrots are disgusting. They are noisy, dirty, and one even will curse at you. As far as Yoli's. I sat outside for 15 minutes before someone even attempted to take our order and then it was 45 minutes to get a sandwich! They blamed it on a large party being there and not even grill space. I would never go there again!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth trying.  Off the beaten path, great food, staff and price, will be back when visiting AZ in the future."}
{"text":"My dad and brother came here last year and haven't stopped talking about it since. We had to come back during spring training! Off the beaten path, and you might not even know exactly where it is, it's so worth the searching. Located in a run down area of Chandler, don't let that turn you away!!!  The food is outstanding. I got the corned beef hash and it was great--dad and brother got veggie omelette and skillet with the country potatoes and both were great. We got an order of the Hawaiian French toast to share and it was amazing!!!  While the service was a tad slow, it's just because so many people were here enjoying it, and the owner was so nice and funny. Eating outside is the best with the bird sanctuary right next door. Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Classic mom n pop place! Casual and slow paced! Emphasis on taking time to prepare a fresh and taste filled meal! Veggie omelet was loaded with fresh grilled veggies! Coffee hot and service friendly!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a whim. I'm glad I did. The food is good and the small diner feel has the extra garden and bird sounds if you take a table on the patio. The servers are nice and the plates were served fast.   All the condiments are on the table. The menu is simple."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. The restaurant is small and the tables inside are fairly close to each other, so it's a little claustrophobic feeling. On my second visit, I sat outside which didn't feel so cramped."}
{"text":"I've never had such a mouth watering craving for food like I do for Yoli's breakfast. This place is my #1 favorite place to eat in Phoenix. You get great food in a friendly unpretentious atmosphere. The food is absolutely amazing. And the prices are very good. For a wonderful meal in a great environment definitely visit Yoli's. Try the morning monte You'll love it."}
{"text":"Yes! They are open again! Parking sucks as the next door lot is now fenced off but I love the check-in discount they give and the food is great! Service is super friendly, very accommodating with my little toddler too! Great little gem."}
{"text":"I had the Morning Monte which was delicious. I never would of found out about this place without Yelp. It's in a residential area off the main road. Don't let that fool you though, the food was good and staff was friendly. The outside area was nice and they even had a macaw!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for Sunday brunch and sat at a table outside.  The atmosphere was outstanding, quiet and peaceful.  I had the sausage and cheese omelet that came with a biscuit and hash browns, all smothered with white gravy.  All I can say is, \"Incredibly delicious!\"   Yoli herself waited on us and was wonderful.  No waiting to be seated, served or for coffee refills.  One of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time.  We are new customers for life.  What a find, thanks to yelp."}
{"text":"Anytime, I'm in Downtown Chandler in the morning, I must stop by Yoli's Cafe for breakfast.  This place just does it right, never had a bad meal or bad service.  Keep making that great food!"}
{"text":"We had been talking about coming here ever since we read about them winning the the taste of Chandler this year. Finally, last Sunday we decided to go in for breakfast, but by the time we got there, it was 1:30.  Very cute place and very clean. They have a great menu and we ordered lunch, although on Sunday they serve breakfast until they close. I had the Monte Cristo and my wife had the tuna melt. My wife said her tuna melt was delicious, perfectly cooked and very tasty with seasoned fries. My Monte Cristo was made with Hawaiian french toast and served with a spicy marmalade. Both were fantastic. They even brought out a taste of their award winning pulled pork for us, and after trying it, we clearly understood why they won.  The best part was the staff, who were all very friendly and took the time to talk to us and make us feel at home.  Yoli came out to see how our food was, and sat down with us and we talked for quite some time.  She is a great cook and a really nice person.  Please go there and give them business - let's help keep the small places going strong in Chandler - this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"What a difference a day can make!  Yesterday my wife and her friends stopped at Yoli's for breakfast on the way to the Gem Stone Show in Tucson. When she came home and she said we have to go back, that she really had enjoyed her breakfast.  So this morning I agreed to give it a try.  I'm a big fan of locally owned joints and always try to support those verses chain restaurants.   Yoli's is off on a little side street in downtown Chandler.  It's in a converted little bungalow that features some other little shops in a common courtyard.  When we walked in, 9:30ish, there were some tables available and a waitress walked by and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  Around the same time several other couples came in and seated themselves.  Customers around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and from what I could see they looked good.  We continued to see wait staff running around but nobody was acknowledging us, they could have said' \"sorry, we'll be with you in a moment\".  Now my wife is getting perturbed, I'm normally the one that says I'm outta here after 10 minutes but today for some reason I was being the voice of reason. Finally after 18 minutes the same waitress comes by and asked if we have looked a menu yet, we didn't have any yet, we have no beverages or silverware - nothing!  She comes back with 1 and says that they don't have any extra menus and could we share this one.  Still hasn't asked us if we would care to have anything to drink.  After she finished serving the table next to us she then asks if we would like anything to drink, finally!  She comes back with our coffee and waters and she takes our order.  When my wife inquires about the potato choice we are told that they are out of the country potatoes today.  Its mid-morning and you are running out of potatoes already?  Ok, so we get our ordered placed and start to enjoy our coffee.  In the mean time I'm noticing 2 couples sitting outside and they have been waiting at least 15 minutes and no one is acknowledging them, you can see them looking around to see if they can flag down help.  When they finally wait on them we notice that they are getting their coffee in paper cups.  Then we hear another waitress tell the four top next to us that they have run out of coffee cups and hope they don't mind the paper ones.  My wife says they never had to wait the day before, which they had great service and the food was out in descent time.  Not so today.  It's now been 40 minutes since we placed our order, the waitress comes out to the table next to use to ask who ordered the Steak & Peppers Skillet, they reply that isn't our order, the waitress turns and looks at us (mind you now, she took our order) and says I wonder who ordered this.  I said that I also ordered the Steak & Pepper Skillet and she says they wrote the wrong table number on the slip.  (It was you honey) She then hands me a menu and ask if I would like to order something else, that they are out of Carne Asada for that meal.  This tells me that the cooks aren't checking what is being ordered until they are preparing that meal or the waitress is not in tune with the kitchen.  Either way that was the final straw for me.  We left and I'm disappointed for them.  You have to take care of your customers in a timely manner.  I could have over looked running out of some of the ingredients but not 40 minutes after you have taken my order.  Someday, if you last, I will try you again.  Good luck Yoli's!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this restaurant has been hiding here all this time and I never knew!  Tucked into a residential neighborhood in Chandler, right behind The Birdcage ... Yoli's is a gem!  Sit in the back patio if ambiance is important to you, as the inside leaves much to be desired in the way of aesthetics. The food was fabulous. I was disappointed at first that they do not have eggs Benedict on the menu. That being said, my sweet and speedy server was right in stating that there were many other delicious options from which to choose. I had a veggie omelette and my dining companion had the Denver omelette with home fries and fruit on the side. The omelettes were light and fluffy with lots of fresh ingredients. The coffee is fabulous ... a must for any breakfast joint. Next time you're near downtown Chandler, consider this little eatery and support local business!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try. We used door dash delivery service. Unfortunately the small menu they offer on there is not what they actually offered.  They didn't have the kids menu items so a chorizo burrito was suggested as the only other option as they didn't have a ham and egg burrito as their menu stated they did. The pancakes were huge. Hawaiian french toast wasn't bad, muffin and fruit were average. The food was average overall,may have been better if we went to the actual location, but I think we will pass on that for now. Maybe they will update their menu on there so others can have a better experience."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place! The food is awesome and the service is top notch! I usually get the Mornin' Monte, but on Saturday I tried the chorizo burrito and my husband ordered a bagel sandwich which were both so very tasty. We love coming here because the food is so damn good, the ambiance can't be beat and everyone is so friendly. They even remember us and that makes me feel so special :)"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, a group of friends and I headed to Yolis Cafe. We where greeted by a very friendly wait person who quickly fixed up a table for the eight of us. Our wait person was very friendly, and very attentive. We were all very happy with our breakfast items, which we chose from a large selection of offerings. The manager stopped by to make sure we were all happy and satisfied.  It was a beautiful day and we sat outside without ever going inside, but I looked in the window as we left, and it was very small inside. It might be hard to get a seat inside on a cold or rainy day, but some of the tables were cove"}
{"text":"great food ,we used to go all the time  the last time we went the place was closed. thought they went out of business!!!! glade to see that they are still open!! thanks"}
{"text":"Good pancakes and hash browns - with a generous portion size on the hash browns. Also enjoyed the Monte Cristo. Good service from the chef's husband. Another nice touch was the fruit water - tasted like cantaloupe, very refreshing."}
{"text":"Patience required! The service and apparently the kitchen moves at an extremely slow pace.  It took about 20 min to be seated, which was completely fine, but took an hour plus some minutes to get our food!! Once the food arrived it wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular. The service was maybe slightly less than okay."}
{"text":"Had breakfast today at Yoli's. The place was nice. Since it was our first time here, the staff who served us was so accommodating. She explained all the meals in the menu and gave us a very good recommendation as to what is the favorites. I ended up ordering Mornin Monte.. It was delicious. The chili infused marmalade is sooo good too. I will definitely come back and bring friends here.."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambience. The service was good and the garden with all the birds is wonderful. It was nice finding this hidden gem in Chandler! We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"\"You can't rush perfection.\"-Said a really, really smart guy somewhere.   As someone who travels relentlessly across the globe, trying both national chains and local gems alike, I must say that Yoli's Cafe is the one place that I love coming back to. However, I won't write about their \"Morning Monte\" for two key reasons: 1. Everyone else has. Read their reviews. 2. I've never had it. (Although next time I go in I'll have to try it!)  Around two years ago, my dad and I were looking for a new place to eat breakfast. We'd looked everywhere from Scottsdale to Tempe, Phoenix to Glendale, and while we found a few good places and met some nice people, we still were unable to find that one amazing place. Our search ended when we took a look into our backyard: Downtown Chandler. There, we found a cozy little cafe owned by quite possibly the nicest, most talented cooks that this world has ever known.  Once we were seated, the first thing we noticed was the huge amounts of variety that their menu offered. Their breakfast combo allowed us to mix and match a variety of breakfast favorites like bacon, french toast, eggs, pancakes, and around ten other choices, while their portion sizes were enough to feed even the hungriest of people. Eventually, we settled on trying a little bit of everything via breakfast combo.  After about a 15-20 minute wait that was filled with extremely fun small-talk with our waitress, we received some of the best food that I have ever had. I would go so far as to say that I was PRIVILEGED to try these amazing cooks' food. Most notably, however, were their biscuits and gravy. The biscuits are far from ordinary, plain, boring bread shaped into round masses of blah. No, they are flavorful, fluffy, and fantastic, owing in part to the fact that they're cheddar biscuits (and yes, they are better than Red Lobster's). Finally, they are usually put on the grill (they're cut in half) for a moment to lightly toast and have butter melted on them. Kudos to Yoli, to whom these biscuits owe their name, for creating these little pieces of heaven. The gravy was nice, not too much sausage, but not lacking either, and perfectly seasoned.  When the two were paired though, well, let's just say it was like a symphony of deliciousness.   I realize that some people just don't like the old southern classic, but at Yoli's they can still find something phenomenal to savor. Their french toast is to die for, while their veggie burrito is my vegetarian grandma's favorite. A word of advice, though, do NOT order the pancakes if you aren't ready to a) stop eating McDonald's breakfast forever b) eat lots and lots of awesomeness (they're VERY big)  After two years of visiting this haven of culinary delights, I offer three hints of advice to those who wish to try Yoli's: 1) LISTEN TO THE WARNINGS ABOUT PEAK TIMES! Every breakfast place is bound to be crowded at the so-called \"peak-time\" of the morning. Yoli's is no exception. They may be culinary wizards, but they don't have time machines. If you want to be stubborn/don't mind waiting, be their guest and wait for a table. However, do NOT be rude to the staff just because YOU had the inability to realize that more people means a longer wait.  2) Don't be afraid to talk to the staff. They're extremely nice and will offer honest opinions on the food. Also, chatting with them helps time fly. 3) They have big food. Good big food, but still, big food.    I look forward to my next visit to this amazing cafe, and urge anyone who likes to eat good food to try out Yoli's Cafe."}
{"text":"Some of these 1 and 2 star reviewers need to go eat at Denny's more often if all they want is a cattle trough feeding experience. You had to wait for a table?  Well no kidding.  When the place has 9 or 10 tables, there might indeed be a wait.    Some of us like a leisurely weekend breakfast or brunch at a small, family owned cafe and we don't mind the wait.     The facts are that Yoli's has very good food that is delivered with a smile by a staff that feels more like family than strangers if you bother to step into the place more than once.    Prices are very reasonable for everything on the menu.  The cheddar biscuits are amazingly good.  Breakfast skillets, omelettes, pancakes, etc. are all delicious and the portions are very generous.     The wait for food has never seemed excessive to me after eating here at least 15 times.  Wait times seem appropriate given a small kitchen and small kitchen staff and everything on the menu being made to order."}
{"text":"I visited Yoli's two weeks ago for a breakfast business meeting.  It was a great experience.  The staff were personable and polite.  Our waitress told us about the area and was very patient when our guest was late.  Bringing coffee regularly, but not interrupting.  The food was excellent.  It was so nice to find a non-chain restaurant in the Chandler area with great food at a price I can afford to go to when work isn't buying. :-)  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This place is seriously awesome. My boyfriend and i have been staying down the street for a wedding so we tried the food for the first time on friday. The prices are super fair and the quantities are huge! We haven't had time to dine in and enjoy but we got take out and ate on our hotel room balcony. We have eaten at Yoli's three days in a row now!!! Breakfast and lunch! There was nothing we didn't love. If your in this area you gotta try it. WARNING...place is addicting so you won't just order one time, we didn't even consider giving another place a try"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Chandler!  Right behind Gangplank, on the south side of The Perch.  All cool spots that make me want to live on that block."}
{"text":"Since \"discovering\" this place a couple months ago on yelp, my wife and I have been several times by ourselves and with family or friends. Everyone raved about their meal and the quaint atmosphere, it's not high end or pretencious, but it's clean and bright with good service. Some of the servers and staff look a little \"earth muffiny\" with tats and casual clothes, but they're very friendly and attentive. It reminds me of having breakfast at my grandmother's farmhouse when I was a kid-- very comforting and down to earth, but with healthier choices. :) The prices are very reasonable and their lunch menu is more diverse than I expected. The Monte Cristo is my favorite, with Bs&Gs (biscuits and gravy) a close second. There is indoor and outdoor seating. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new to the Chandler area and have been trying many of the local restaurants.  This is the best breakfast spot. Everything we ordered was good & great service as well. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My wife and me love the food. We would definitely recommend this place. The owners are very present and greet is on every visit."}
{"text":"I would have never found this place had it not been for yelp. It definitely is hidden but very cute. The husband had the chorizo burrito and I had the carne asada burrito. Both were great! I want to return for the morning monte cristo... Looks delicious! Prices are more than fair and this place is a great alternative to the chain breakfast places. Give it a try and support local businesses!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you! My girlfriend and I weren't sure it it was a real restaurant or not. What a diamond in the rough though! Get a smoothie and try everything you can!"}
{"text":"If you have taste buds and you want to reward them with a little bit of pure joy then you need to do the following:  Put down your phone Put pants on Find car keys Drive to Yolis Park car Order ANYTHING Tell your mouth \"you're welcome\""}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my daughter and we really enjoyed Yolis.  It is a diamond in the rough.  Never would have found or just gone in if it weren't for the great reviews on Yelp.  I had veggie omelet and it was delicious!   My daughter had the biscuits and gravy and she loved it.  It was different than others she has had.   The homefries were excellent and again different than most.  Prices were great.   It's just a tiny little place, which we liked.  Waitress was very nice and accommodating.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this home style breakfast place !   Very friendly staff and love looking at the birds after eating."}
{"text":"Never will I return to this place, I have not tried their food but the customer service alone was enough to make me never want to come back.So me and my friend show up albeit on a saturday morning we go inside because there's no clear signs as to where we should sit we ask one of the servers if we can just sit anywhere she says and I quote \"yes go ahead and sit anywhere there's no wait list\" so we go sit at a table after sitting there for a good 5 minutes another server comes and tells us that's not assigned to yolis mind you its still in the courtyard so we ask him where we should sit he looks pretty confused at this point and starts clearing up a table for us, well then a lady comes which I assume is the owner and very rudely says you guys can't sit here those people over there have been waiting for over an hour for this table we have a waiting list inside. I told her I had asked a server inside and she told me there was no list her response exactly was and at this point she had raised her voice \"well I'm telling you you cannot sit here and there is a waiting list\" by this time we had had it we left and if it wasn't for a parade that was going on in the downtown area we would have gone to in pockets which we love and always get treated with respect. Very unpleasant people and very disorganized place.."}
{"text":"First, the food is really good.  The Biscuits and Gravy with Chorizo on top...my word, its amazing.  Which is why I have 2 stars.  My girlfriend and I have been coming here consistently, to the point of us working on a deal with the owner to get some coffee from them.    This past weekend, we had family drive down from north phoenix to come enjoy our favorite breakfast spot.  There were 5 of us.  We called on the way to check on the wait, there was none, and it was \"Dead\".  The woman on the phone was rather rude to my girlfriend on the phone, but, we all have days.  No biggie.    We get there, and 3 tables had just been sat, and there was no room, inside, for our table of 5.  30 min wait.  We noticed two tables were close to finishing their meals and we asked if we could just pull 2 tables together (like every restaurant has done, ever...since forever).  We were rudely told NO, we can't because it would be in the isle.  Well, without drawing a diagram, it would have simply required 2 steps more to get around the table.  Not a huge deal.  Not blocking a an exit or the kitchen.   We decided to leave and find another business that would be happy to have 5 people spending $15 a piece on breakfast.  The most disappointing part of this, is that we loved this place.  LOVED it! However, we work hard for our money, and will not be giving any more of it to a business that is rude, and unaccommodating to people who want to spend money.    As a small business owner, my advice, get some descent people running your business.  I have met the owner, nice enough, but the people we interacted with were rude, and VERY unwilling to be helpful in any sort of way.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Yoli's Cafe is quite charming, I really love the ambiance of the surrounding square even though it is not in the best of places. I really wanted to give Yoli a 4 star and they deserve a 3.5 really. I've had only breakfast here and I had about 5 different items to really try and get that 4th star for them in my mind, but I just could not find that dish that really scream 4 or 5 star. They do things well and they try to be creative but are off the mark a little. The best is likely their French Toast with hawaiian bread is well done, but the syrup is just tad low in quality. The breakfast burrito, I was not much of a fan, seems generic nothing that stood out. The skillet is enormous and filled with great different items but the biscuit was not really a biscuit but more of a roll than a biscuit. The omelete was also decent, but a little too much cheese. Don't get me wrong, I like Yolis and I would not hesitate to recommend it to people I know but I can not say that the food is 4 star. It is what it is which is a nice little cafe with decent food."}
{"text":"Yolu's Cafe is a gem in downtown Chandler. Yoli and her staff are so friendly and the relaxed atmosphere makes for a great morning start. Yoli's menu is fresh and eclectic. Try her Hawaiian French Toast or Fruit and Yogurt Parfait. Yoli makes her own granola you have to try."}
{"text":"Awesome Monte Cristo! Staff is super friendly. Yoli's Cafe is so good that I had to make a yelp account just to write a review and recommend it. 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I loved it. My family came with me, including my husband, 2 young sons and my mother in law. The kids played with the puzzle and coloring books making it nice for the adults to talk. The best part of our experience was being about to go outside and enjoy the garden area. Overgrown trees shade the cobblestone walk. They have cages outside filled with birds for everyone to enjoy. It was a great way to spend sunday morning. The food was huge portions, and I will be back next weekend for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfasts! The Morning Monte was the best, don't skip on the jam.Everything that my family ordered was delicious! Wish they would put misters on the patio since it is a bit hot and limited seating indoors. Will definitely be going back and adding to our breakfast restaurant list,"}
{"text":"Arrived at Yolis with a 6 person party...so not surprised by the long wait (although the estimated 20 minutes turn into almost an hour). Was seated, given a 3 free muffins to share while we ordered.  So with tired kids looking forward to the meal. Did not expect the meal to take 45 minutes (we did not comment, but it was explained as new kitchen staff). Then when I went to pay with a coupon that included a free meal. Yoli's proceeded to remove the cheapest meal from my check. I suggested that was incorrect, it should be the 2nd most expensive. Cashier checked...told I was wrong. (Thought about splitting the check...but instead) left my name and phone number along with a note about my displeasure ( did not wish to make a scene in front of grandkids who were more than anxious about getting with their day after a 2+ hour breakfast). This was now a month ago...never heard back. Just ok food, poor service and apparently a lack of interest in retaining customers."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service!!!! They were really busy for breakfast when we went so it took a little while longer than normal to get our food so our waitress brought us out a complimentary muffin to hold us over and apologized. The muffin was INCREDIBLE!!!!!! Talk about great customer service! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went this morning to this place first time looks like a hole in wall but the restaurant outside was beautiful decor and quite wish I would've waited to sit outside. I the morning Monty I think they call it it was amazing that chili marmalade is maid in house and really stands out. And that Hawaiian French toast is really good just good simple ingredients. Definitely come back."}
{"text":"I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean."}
{"text":"Great little place with really good food!  I had the morning monte, which is a twist on the monte cristo for breakfast.  Quite good, but I wouldn't say transcendent.  I also had the biscuits and gravy- again, excellent, but not mind-blowingly memorable.  So, not quite 5 star worthy, but very good!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places. I'm addicted to their egg salad sandwiches! The breakfast are large , like the biscuits and gravy. I bring people here all the time and have never had any complaints. Salads are great too."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant!  I discovered it here on Yelp when I was looking for somewhere for my boyfriend and I to go for breakfast/brunch.  The first thing I like is that it's hard to find: I don't think I'd have ever found it if I wasn't looking.  Depending on if you exit through the front or back, it's like two different neighborhoods.  The second thing I like is the atmosphere.  The square the building sits in is very \"quaint\"... that's the best word for it.  It's a few old houses turned in to business, including a stamp shop.  There's a ton of cool landscaping happening in the middle, complete with an enclosure of birds!  Everyone is really friendly, there is awesome outside seating, and just good service.  Lastly, of course, is the food.  It's nothing extravagant, it's your usual breakfast food and combos, but it tastes like it just came out of my grandma's kitchen.  The pancakes are really good... and that says a lot because I usually won't eat pancakes.  One small touch I appreciate is that they provide flavored creamers, not just original half-and-half.  The coffee is good on its own, but I like a little flavor.    There's no doubt we'll continue to frequent this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an amazing breakfast/brunch spot that is local and privately owned, you need to come here. Excellent service and unparalleled food. Our server was so sweet, and then we had the pleasure of talking with Rick, Yolie's Husband who is probably one of the kindest people on planet Earth. There is absolutely something to be said about a hole in the wall place that exceeds every expectation. We ordered the Morning Monte sandwich and the biscuit and gravy-Volcano style. So so so so so great. We will absolutely be back. Thank you, Yolie's Cafe for making our dining experience so great."}
{"text":"Downtown Chandler's best kept secret! Yoli's is an awesome cafe for casual dining with great food and service. I highly recommend the breakfast skillets, they are delicious, and provide plenty of food to satisfy the heartiest of appetites. Staff is very friendly and attentive, you can't go wrong with Yoli's!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Yoli's cafe...  ooh that rhymed!  Enough rhyming.  Would never have found this place if not for yelp and my normal Saturday ritual of typing breakfast/brunch into the search option to see where the internet is going to send me to fill me up with breakfast goodies.  When I saw a place in Downtown Chandler that was both reviewed as delicious and inexpensive, that's when my search that day ended.  Popped that address into GoogleMaps on my phone and away we go.  \"In a quarter mile make a left turn,\" says my phone in that lovely monotone robot voice reminiscent of a test proctor in grade school.  Are you sure Google Lady?  That looks like houses...  \"Make a left turn!\"  Ok ok ok, I believe you.  Don't have to yell at me.  Oh dear, where are you taking me phone?  Another quick right turn and we are clearly in a neighborhood and right as I about to turn around... \"Your destination is on the right.\"  Oh wait!  It is!  Walking through the doors, I wasn't too sure if I was walking into a restaurant or someone's house.  That's ok though because it smelt heavenly and based on the amount of people in their, this was a restaurant or the home of a really hospitable homeowner who liked to cook.  We were promptly offered a place to sit and given menus.  Phew, it is Yoli's.  I ordered a cup of coffee and an egg skillet.  And dear lord in heaven above, I swear i heard angels singing when it was being carried to my table.  Too dramatic?  I may have let out an audible, \"Oh Yeah!\" similar to that of the Kool-Aid guy though.  Eggs we're cooked to perfection and and coffee kept flowing.  The waitress was very kind and prompt with everything.  It is a definite family feel here at Yoli's.  Did I mention my bill was less than $15 for breakfast for both me and my girlfriend!  Give them a try down at Yoli's!  Trust me, you'll love it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  It has a great breakfast along with some great waitstaff.  If you want to go to a one of a kind breakfast place rather than some  chain this place is it.  Don't  get fooled when you drive up.  It is worth going to?  Congrats on a great place"}
{"text":"Yes there was over an hour wait but the food was worth it ... The service was good and everything was hot and delicious when brought to the table"}
{"text":"One of the best Yogurt and Fruit Parfait in town. Been there multiple times and always loved their Yogurt and Fruit Parfait .  Also tried other breakfast options and liked them a lot.  Love the ambiance they share - Tropical atmosphere with tropical plants ,flowers ( (hibiscus etc ) and tropical birds ( Colorful Parrots which are rescue birds ) . Feels like an Oasis in the Desert."}
{"text":"Excellent breskfast in low-key atmosphere. Had the mornin' monte, and my wife had the veggie burrito. Equally delicious! Our waitress was fabulous and very welcoming."}
{"text":"Decided on this place because of the Yelp reviews.  It wasnt disappointing at all.  It looks crazy from the outside and I had no idea the kind of place I was walking into.  But once insides, feels like a little diner or normal breakfast spot.  I ordered a steak and onion and pepper skillet.  It came with my choice of hashed browns or potatoes and i went with the hash browns.  Visually, with the fresh guacamole slices on top, it was amazing.  It looked like the best, most well put together dish I have ever seen for breakfast.  It was a little bland though.  It needs some hot sauce, and just felt like it was missing some seasoning.  But it was super fresh, and when the hot sauce was added it was outstanding.  I would come back for sure, and would like to see how some of the other items taste and look."}
{"text":"The steak and peppers skillet and French toast were delicious! Service was good too, coffee cup was never empty and the waiters were friendly!"}
{"text":"A bit of a gem in the rough. Hard to find in the middle of a neighborhood, but once inside, you will be happy you did!! The atmosphere is very warm and family feeling. The muffins are clearly homemade and fabulous. The yogurt and fruit parfait has actual fresh delicious fruit and out of this world homemade granola! I had the carne asana breakfast burrito. Thumbs UP! Hubby had the biscuits and gravy volcano style with 2 over medium eggs. Almost licked the plate! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"100% terrible , went there fri morning with my wife after seeing all the great things people where saying about the place they should close up .  IF. You own a restaurant and you can't give your paying customers   Your full attention since they are paying you for you supposedly great food really shut the doors and finish doing what ever it is that is so important like moving or closing I overheard the very loud bigger lady who acted like she was in charge say the restaurant was bought out but they where more interested in pushing furniture out the front door than bringing service to the back where the customers where I dropped a fork and it took 10 min to get another and the actual waitress did more time bullshitting with her \" old customers \" kissing them goodbye then trying to take care of the present ones and to top it off she had a real bad cough she never once washed her hands  If I remember correctly this the place that was on the news as a struggling new restaurant in the new hipster downtown chandler  bye bye I hope another beer brewery opens up instead! and the food was horrible with no taste"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Yoli's Cafe, but our experience was less than stellar yesterday. When I arrived, I was told the wait would be 20 minutes. I wound up waiting an hour. I've never waited that long in any restaurant in Phx before.  When we finally sat down, we weren't given menus, we had to track someone down to get some.  It took a long time for our order to be taken and to actually deliver the food to the table. My friend was getting irritable and I think that's the only reason our food came faster!lol The patrons next to us got so fed up that they left. The French toast was not good and the short stack pancakes were just ok.  They were a little \"doughy\" for me, but my friend loved them.  Since her French toast sucked, she had to eat my pancakes to get full. Now the pièce de résistance was the cheddar biscuit breakfast sandwich. OMG! So good! Get it please! Mine had egg whites, spinach, mushroom and Havarti cheese. It was one of the bagel sandwiches, that I subbed the biscuit instead. On the positive side, our waitress was very nice and apologized several times and even provided us with a muffin to hold us over.  I understand that they were swamped possibly due to the festival going on that day, but everything really reflected poorly on their establishment.  The prices for breakfast are very affordable, so I guess that's why people flock here.  I'm definitely willing to give it another shot, especially for that biscuit sandwich. Plus I really want to support local family owned businesses."}
{"text":"Best skillet I have ever eaten is at this place.  the Hearty, it is no joke a perfect breakfast skillet.  The Hawaiian French toast with chile marmalade is also excellent and a very unique and excellent way to do French toast.  One of the best breakfast spots this side of the Mississippi!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for the very first time together this morning and it was good! She got the country style omelette which looked delicious and I got the two hot cakes which were good but nothing too special. The reason I didn't give it a 5/5 is because it was good but it wasn't anything to die about and I would like a little bit more of breakfast options on their menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here! Great food and people. I try to come every weekend. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"There is a quaint little place tucked away behind Downtown Chandler. It sits on an off road you would think it was a residential place only you look further and there you Find Yoli's. This being my first visit I found it quite Charming small and out of the way but much better then some of the chain restaurants. It only serves breakfast and lunch and if they expanded I'm sure they would be quite full. I had a sausage and biscuit and my husband had the volcano sausage and biscuits which has chorizo on it. The flavor was amazing. Fresh and warm and tasty. Don't miss out on one of Chandler's better little restaurants for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"YUMM! No wonder why this place won awards! The service and food were amazing! Their prices are pretty good too. The neighborhood that its in isn't ritzy (there's a tattoo shop next door), but it's still a great little hidden gem. Unlike a lot of the chains out there, Yoli's will really appreciate your business.  (Try the Monte Crisco, it's delicious!)"}
{"text":"Yoli's is a little hidden gem in downtown Chandler.  It's got a little patio with a lot people waiting to be sat.  Everything is made FRESH, so it takes awhile for you to get your food.  Be patient when you come here, it's worth it, but everything takes a while to get to you.  They are on Hawaii time, aka no time.    The staff is super nice and they are very attentive.  They will come around on a regular basis, let you know where you're at with your order and refill your drinks right away and they always as if you want your drinks to go before you leave!  Recommend trying:  French Toast Biscuits and Gravy Skillet  The biscuits and gravy sell out fast so I would recommend getting there early if that's your favorite dish!  PS - before you leave, pick up a cupcake... you won't regret it I promise!"}
{"text":"What can say? Believe the hype! This mom and pop gem is truly a destination for serenity and great food. Like many others I went with the \"Mornin Cristo\". It was equally balanced in sweetness and savoryness. I had my egg over-easy  to make it a little more richer. The Spicy Orange Marmalade compliments it perfectly; for those who don't like a sweet and spicy kick you can also eat it with regular syrup. The coffee was smooth and velvety , I didn't even have to use sugar. The service was friendly but not overly bearing. I ate in the courtyard facing the water fountain it was so peaceful. The prices are so low and didn't feel the need to use the 10% check-in offer through Yelp. I will definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Their food is comparable to Denny's but sit down setting is nicer : )  I had the steak skillet for breakfast. Was told they marinate the steak but it tasted pretty plain and I had to use ketchup (which I rarely use). Personally, it's as good Denny's skillet. But this place definitely have a nicer sit out garden environment."}
{"text":"Cindy said Yum n Come! We were particularly impressed with Caroline's attentiveness; she brought us a birthday muffin- freshly made lemon blueberry, for birthday boy, Jonh. Love it.  . The Hawaiian French Toast is light, airy, eggy, so gooood. Veggie burrito and veggie skillet are all good."}
{"text":"french toast done RIGHT! Best I ever had.  Loses a star though for appearance, not the nicest inside.   Priced well and amazing service. Again, try the French toast."}
{"text":"Closed for renovation. Not sure how long.  4 rating since didn't eat there and that was the average."}
{"text":"Cute place, pretty easy to find. The outside area is fairly small but we were able to get a table with no wait. Greeted very friendly when we went in. Good food; I had the chorizo burrito and hubby had the hearty skillet. Those plus an iced tea and an orange juice came to $17 and some change and with the 10% off for checking in, it was $15 and change not including tip. The only problem we had was the long wait times. It took awhile to give our drink order, took awhile to get them, and it took a lot longer than expected to get our food after we ordered. We'll be back though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the staff always remembers return customers, they could not be any nicer and the food, amazing. I could eat there every day!"}
{"text":"Love the courtyard area, except if you are looking at the house next door. Make sure you face toward The Perch so you see greenery, art, and exotic birds.  The service was ok, somewhat friendly, and slow.  The food was great, loved the Hawaiian french toast.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"This was a very tasty and reasonable priced little restaurant.  The atmosphere is very homey; of course, its in what used to be an old house.  When you pull up, on Oregon St., it is the back of the restaurant.  You'll have to walk on the north side through what used to be a backyard gate.  As soon as you pass through the gate you realize how charming the outdoor patio will be once all the construction is complete for the other shops/restaurants.   We got to the restaurant just a little before 9:00am and we were sat immediately.  The young lady doing the register/host duties sat us and got us our drinks.   Since everyone suggested the Mornin' Monte, we got that; we also got the cheddar biscuits & steak and pepper skillet.  As I said before, all were tasty.  The Mornin' Monte was a little sweet for me, but my wife thought it was just right.  She especially liked the special marmalade that came with it.  The steak and peppers were prepared wonderfully and the chedder biscuits were smothered in gravy.   If they don't use the patio, it is very small (maybe 10 tables).  Because of the seating situation, know that a wait is probably more the norm, for anytime after 10:00am.  Again, it was very good, we plan to come back."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for the first time this morning. There were 13 of us and 7 were small children. My wife and I had gotten so used to restaurant staff treating our children as an inconvenience and even annoyance that we had forgotten what it was like to have genuine, kind, wonderful people serve us. They put us in a semi private room, put cartoons on the flat screen for the kids and the owner even came out and held my 2 year old son, who melted in her caring arms. All the staff seemed like family and treated us like family. The food came out quickly and was delicious. Portions are large and very reasonably priced. Our family has decided to make eating here a monthly tradition (we don't all get together often). This place is not fancy, it's laid back and relaxing. I highly recommend getting there early and sitting out in the garden patio, sipping a warm cup of joe and enjoying a truly pleasant experience. This place is one of chandlers best kept secrets for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful location, wonderful food, wonderful service. My first time here will definitely not be my last! Highly recommend coming here for a cozy, cute breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family on a Sunday morning. We arrived at about 8:50 and there were 3 tables outside. We asked if our family of four (two adults, 3 yr old and 8mo) could sit outside at a table with 3 chairs and the blonde girl behind the check in was utterly rude and gave us attitude saying \"if we are ok being squished\" I couldn't believe it. If it's open and available, let the customer sit down, instead of waiting for a larger table to arrive when you specifically say \"we don't take reservations\".  First in best dressed. The gentleman who got us our drinks apologized for the way we were treated inside and I appreciated that. We ordered our meal, my eggs that I had asked for were completely raw. I had asked for them to be poached. I bought it to the woman servers attention and she proceeded to ask me if I wanted them \"poached hard\" I told her \"no, I just want them poached please\". Mind you the egg white was still completely clear. She took them away and I waited exactly 17 minutes for them to return with the poached eggs. This time they were completely overdone. No runny yolk whatsoever. I bought it to the lovely gentlemen's attention and the server came out and interrupted us and said she would notify the back. There was never one discount or apology from the woman. This was the most appalling customer service we have ever had. I will never return here and I will notify all people I know about the horrible experience we had. Kudos to the gentleman who worked there that noticed the mistakes that had been made. He should have been the server!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding place for breakfast!  My wife thought it was the best French toast she has ever eaten and the biscuits and gravy are to die for!"}
{"text":"Loved our first visit here!  Good thing we mapped the spot because it would definitely be easy to miss given it's on Oregon in a residential neighborhood just W of AZ Ave.  We were quickly seated in their outdoor patio.  The weather was fair and breezy, so it was a good option to be outside.  Patio furniture is plain and decor is sparse, but the friendliness of the staff and the anticipation of some yummy food kept us happy.  Our order did take a bit long to fill (the friendly server gave us a heads up on that before we waited too long or got frustrated), but when it came, I thoroughly enjoyed my green eggs and ham, Sam I am!  My hubby got the Morning Monte and enjoyed it but not as much as he liked the bite from my green eggs and ham (he said mine was definitely much tastier).  The meals were very filling and at 18$ for breakfast for two - I like that!!  I will definitely come again as their other omelets and burritos looked worth trying."}
{"text":"French toast without a smothering of syrup!  Great ambience for a lazy summer morning, we loved the touch of heat in the marmalade that came with the french toast, the cheddar biscuit sandwich was also tasty (a little salty for my taste, but I didn't order this one).  Wait staff was helpful, prompt, personable.  And because it *was* a lazy summer morning, Yoli came out and chatted as we lingered over our coffee and the younger one in our party checked out the parrots in the courtyard. Looking forward to gradually making my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Top tip for Chandler: stay at the historic San Marcos Resort Hotel and stroll through the charmingly renovated downtown square to Yoli's for a super friendly family breakfast.  We enjoyed the great (and quick) service and the charming mister-cooled funky courtyard complete with parrots.  Don't forget to ask for the home made chile marmalade."}
{"text":"Fairly average shop, really nothing special here. While the servers were friendly (albeit lax and fairly slow--they didn't take our order for about 10 minutes). The skillets were poorly seasoned, the breakfast bagel sandwiches were disappointing, and their flagship meal, the mornin Monte, was fine but felt incomplete. The chili marmalade was quite good, though."}
{"text":"Crap food, crap service. Not sure what the appeal is here. the place was dead we waited an hour for our food, I could have made my own eggs and bacon by that time and at 10$ a pop could have fed 20 people. One piece of bacon and runny eggs (ugh). The service was terrible too, we were outside and it was warm, our server never came by to check on us, apologize about the wait, fill our drinks etc. People with larger tables were getting their food and we had been there longer, truth be told she probably forgot about us. When she did resurface she smelled awful, like cigarettes. I love a good dive breakfast place, this is a dive but far from good."}
{"text":"Friendly service, the food is OK. The coffee is hot and fresh, but very weak (I like it strong). :-)"}
{"text":"First time eating there for a late breakfast... And everything was just not up to par!  Nothing was fresh... Bacon and sausage look like they were sitting there since 5 a.m. charred and stale!   Good service.."}
{"text":"Loved this quaint spot! Service was friendly and fast. Food was very good, we had the corned beef hash and the Monte, we will definitely return soon. I'm glad we finally decided to try it out. Next time I want to sit in their outdoor patio though."}
{"text":"yumyumyumyumyum!  Ok, I really like this place. I've been searching for the perfect biscuit sandwich since I left North Carolina. Yoli's has a delicious one that makes a Carolina girl happy in the morning. It's so nice to have a place for a homemade breakfast just a hop, skip and a jump from the office. If I ever stop obsessing over the biscuit sandwich (not likely), I want to try their breakfast burritos, skillets and french toast. Word on the street is that those are amazing as well.  You can also walk here from Gangplank if you stop by to work and need some good food in your belly. They serve lunch as well as breakfast, and I think they are open until 3."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent... Was there for bday breakfast for my dear friend and Yoli herself made it an extra special day by bringing out an iced coffee with a bday candle in it for my friend... The food was amazing and enough to share. Staff was all a pleasure to work with and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a negative review just to keep other people away from it.  It's a hidden gem in Downtown Chandler area.  Went there for breakfast on Sunday and the food was awesome!  The service was outstanding as well.  Definitely sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Great food and great service consistently. I've been a frequenter of yolis got 3 years now and it's amazing. Love the pancakes, biscuits and gravy and the bacon. For lunch the burgers and salads can't be beat. A gem of chandler for sure and a must try!"}
{"text":"We are from Minnesota, visiting out daughter. She took us to Yoli's for breakfast. The outside is misleading. It doesn't look like a typical restaurant. The inside is very cute. They have a very nice outdoor area as well. But the food....the food is AMAZING!! The pancakes are the best we have ever had without question. Fluffy, light and wonderful. The chorizo omelet was so good. The steak and peppers..fantastic. And the portions are huge. And the service was great. The staff look like they really enjoy working there. I'm so disappointed they are closed on Mondays because I'd love to eat there once more before we go home. But we will eat here every time we come back. Highly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but took over 40 mins to arrive to our table; the food didn't justify the wait.  There were a lot of people there which says other good things about the quality of the food, but this probably didn't help how long our food took.  It looked like there was a single cook working a small griddle."}
{"text":"I found this little gem of a place thanks to Yelp! What a find!  It definitely doesn't look like much from the outside but WOW the food was aaaahhhhmazing!  It is very small but if there is a line - it is worth the wait.  I had the Mornin' Monte and I highly recommend it. My friend had French toast and said it was delish. We both had the country potatoes which were good too.  I look forward to trying other items the next time I am in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! I had the steak and pepper skillet with country potatoes and I could probably order that every single time and be a happy camper!Also my food came with homemade flour tortillas, which were delicious! Definitely coming back, super affordable, homey little gem! Oh and my husband said his biscuits and gravy were bomb!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure who these people are that gave glowing reviews of Yoli's cafe, but this place isn't anything special.. My girlfriend and I decided to try this place based on the yelp reviews, and we didn't like it much. The service was slow, the hostess station inside was very crowded ( one of the servers bumped me into the coffee station), just a overall disorganized cafe. We thought that the food would make up for their short comings, but it was just like any other local cafe. Save your time, and patience by going somewhere else...."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good restaurant. They had really good breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches. Don't let the out ward appearance fool you. Its a wonderful little restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is beautiful and kids love seeing the birds! Outdoor seating is great(when the weather permits, since it is Arizona) the French toast is to die for! There also cute little shops to visit and the hot chocolate was delicious! Perfect place for breakfast or brunch :)"}
{"text":"The food here was really good. It's in a super cute hidden spot. The breakfast combo was perfect and I got to taste a little bit of everything I wanted; the French toast was very yummy. All the people working there were super helpful and friendly as well. The part that made this place even more awesome was that they had a bunch of bird cages in the front with a singing cockatoo, love birds, parakeets, parrots, macaws, and more which were so fun to watch and take pictures of. It was a very fun experience overall."}
{"text":"Make sure to visit Luna, a beautiful cockatoo that sings and dances!!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem searching Yelp for someplace new to try.  Excellent food and the nicest people working there.  I had the green eggs n ham which was awesome!  My wife had the morning monte which was excellent!  I live in north Mesa, so a bit of a drive, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after living close by for 2 years. The wait was long on an early Saturday morning but there were open tables so I'm not sure why. Maybe they only sit a few people at a time so the kitchen won't get too backed up. Once we were seated, our food was out very quickly. It was hot and very fresh. Everything was really good (could have been more seasoned) and they gave us plenty of food. The bill was very reasonable... 2 people for $20. If you are in the area looking for a non-chain eatery, you should try this place out."}
{"text":"The monte was excellent and the veggie omelette was divine.  This place was a neat whole in the wall and I will definitely be looking forward to coming back and trying more entrees here. This place is heaven!!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, one of my favorite breakfast spots. I am so glad I ventured out to give it a shot while housesitting in the neighborhood! The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the surroundings are beautiful. My kids love the bird sanctuary, and I find the patio to be super relaxing. If you haven't tried Yoli's yet, do it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was okay ... But I don't think I've ever waited that long for breakfast for two. Simple hash toast egg and bacon took near 45 minutes. I can probably have everything done at home within 15-20 minutes ...  Most y'all are probably saying that they must have been busy ... But I don't consider 4-5 tables busy ..   Disappointed ..."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday after hearing fabulous comments about their food and Yoli. Went for breakfast, had the biscuit and gravy side. the biscuit was warm, flaky, and had a great taste. The gravy itself was pretty decent. I ordered the Carne Asada skillet breakfast. It was delicious. Potatoes were nice and soft not mushy like other places. eggs were done just how i asked for them; over medium not over or undercooked. the carne asada itself looked and tasted like it was a good quality beef. Maybe flank steak. Onions and peppers caramelized just right, nice touch with the avocado. Chandler needs more places like this. It is truly a hidden gem. Plan on being a regular here since it is literally down the street from my work! Also, you can't compete with those prices :)"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place... I live within walking distance and saw a nearly 5 star review.  Unfortunately my visit had not only what would be considered slow service but rather no service.  I had to ask for every refill we received for breakfast, and ended up having to wait for our check for almost a half hour.  I will go back because of the great low prices as well as the quality of the food.  I hate to give a low score to a local joint with such an amazing potential, especially given the fact that service is rarely an issue.  I will go back but will leave this 3 star until then."}
{"text":"Not our first time at Yoli's but nothing has changed.  It is one of the best spots for breakfast/lunch.  The Hawaiian Bread French Toast is amazing, although all the food is delicious.  It is somewhat hard to find as it is one block of the main street in downtown Chandler on Oregon St.   The ambiance is exceptional since you have indoor and outdoor seating.  We have only ever eaten outside and when we're done we head behind Yoli's to The Perch to visit all the exotic birds (rescued).  While you're eating the parrots can sometimes get a little loud but you feel like you're not in Arizona but someplace on a tropical island.  Yoli's is absolutely one of the best."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a converted house rather than one large space which gives it a cozy vibe.  I had the grilled Cristo sandwich and some country potatoes, both very yummy and worth ordering again...although the biscuits and gravy served to a table near me looked delicious enough to try also.  The service was friendly and attentive.   Worth getting a little lost trying to find it.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a cute hidden place in downtown chandler. The seating outside is cozy and you can hear all the birds from The Perch next door. Our breakfast was great and the owner came out to chat with us. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I must be the only person who didn't think this is the best place for breakfast.  The restaurant just has an  average menu.  There a lot of places to go, that I wouldn't recommend this over a chain restaurant. With reading the reviews, maybe I'll try once more in the far future?"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Love the outdoor set up too! If you're looking for a more \"mom and pop\" feel with bomb food this is the place."}
{"text":"Yes! This is by far mine and my son's favorite breakfast place! They never disappoint! We are welcomed like family! Every thing I have ordered from the veggie omelet to the morning monte has been on point! My son always gets the yogurt parfet with house made granola. The only thing that changes is sometimes he gets the kid size and sometimes he get the full size! We love Yoli's! If you are ever in Chandler be sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"Visited this place about brunch time one Saturday. It's somewhere in Chandler downtown. We parked along side Oregon St and walked through this alley like opening from the street. The outside appearance won't knock you over. As soon as you walk into the court yard it's a completely different world. Full of plants and great patio dining. We opted to sit inside since there were seatings immediately available. But next time I would definitely vote for patio seating. The wait staff were friendly and the service was good. I ordered the Hearty Skillet. The best part was the flakey and buttery biscuit crumble. They were heavenly! I'd say one of the best breakfast I've ever had! Will definitely be coming back again. A great place to relax and have breakfast or brunch and lazy away a weekend morning!"}
{"text":"I was apprehensive when it came to eating at a little hole in the wall joint located in the middle of what seemed like a residential area. My buddy and I drove past it 2-3 times without even realizing it.  Food: I ordered the Turkey Pastrami and was pleasantly surprised. The sandwich tasted very good and the meat wasn't overly salty. The Swiss was a nice touch. I'm not a fan of rye bread but it went very well with the rest of the accoutrement.  I didn't have anything else while I was there except for coffee (which was pretty good - got me all wired). I'd like to dine here again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"We have lived in Chandler for many years and never knew this place existed! Very happy we found it on a random search for good breakfast food! My Hubby and I had a tasty meal on the patio, enjoyed the greenery, and listening to the rescue birds from The Perch next door. Good portions for cost. Fast food, and they were busy! Hub had the morning monte and I enjoyed the cheddar buscuit and gravy! We will return!"}
{"text":"Place was a little hard to find but after using Google maps I found it. The set up is kind of like it was built in what used to be a home. I've never seen anything like that but it's GENIUS. I felt like I was in my moms kitchen waiting for breakfast. I ordered a chorizo omelet with potatoes and sourdough bread. Sooooo good, they gave me way too much food but who's to complain? Servers were not too pushy or over bearing (something I hate) I'm coming back In a few days to bring my mom. So good and would highly recommend"}
{"text":"This little cafe in downtown Chandler is hidden away and doesn't look like much from the outside, but is pretty cute once you get into the courtyard. It shares a patio area with the Perch and so you can go see the birds while you wait. There is limited seating, so the wait can seem long for the number of people there. We sat outside even though it was a little on the warm side in order to speed up the process, but there really is no speeding up the process here. I shared the garden skillet and biscuits and gravy with my mom and my dad got the chorizo burrito. The food took a loooong time to come out. Once it did, it was tasty, but nothing particularly special. I'm a bit of a brunch snob though and my parents seemed very well pleased with the food. The prices are good, so if you're looking for a nice outdoor place to go hangout, take your time and not pay too much, this is definitely a good choice. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the upside to things moving a little slowly is that they never try to hurry you out the door. We were welcome to sit and chat as long as we wanted."}
{"text":"Descent breakfast.  Nice atmosphere.  Patio seating is a plus for us.  This was our 2nd trip here and it wasn't quite as good as the 1st. Still, good food with descent prices."}
{"text":"The wife and I went here on a Sunday morning to grab some food since we were in the neighborhood. I looked them up and they had great reviews and the pictures of their food looked really fantastic.  Wow, what a let down... They were a little on the busy side, but I have been to busier places (Mike's Big Breakfast in Phoenix) and had better service.  We sat waiting for a table for about 7-10 minutes.  It was not for a lack of space to sit either, there was several tables open.  At no time did we get acknowledged by any of the four waitstaff working there. No \"we'll be right with you\"...nothing.  It's my opinion they should probably get some better experienced workers.  These people couldn't handle a rush at a Wendy's.  So we got up and left.  As we were walking out the door one girl asked us if we needed a table to which I replied we'll eat somewhere else.  If you like being ignored and having a hard time trying to pick out anyone that works there then this is the place for you.  It is with a sad face that I say that I would NEVER come here again.  We love more than anything going to locally owned restaurants but this place is just poorly operated."}
{"text":"Yoli's Cafe is a great, unexpected breakfast spot in Chandler.   With my mom out of town my dad and I decided to continue our tradition of grabbing some Saturday morning breakfast together. This time we ventured over to Yoli's Cafe, a unassuming spot tucked away just north of downtown Chandler. The semi-hidden location provides a nice courtyard full of vegetation and tropical birds (don't worry ornithophobics, they're all caged up).   My dad decided on the french toast which was made with a sweet hawaiian bread and tasted just as good as it sounds. I went for the biscuits and gravy and when I read that they used cheddar biscuits I wasn't exactly sure what to expect but after the first bite my risk was well rewarded. The cheddar added that little twist, kicking everything up a notch, and the biscuits were cooked too perfection.   The only warning I might give perspective customers is that Yoli's is a small place and things are cooked to order. If you are in a hurry and don't have time to wait a bit for a table or for your food to be cooked you might want to try somewhere else and come back when you have the time."}
{"text":"Delicious place for breakfast! It is a hidden gem tucked away in the neighborhoods next to downtown Chandler!   Awesome breakfast food! Very friendly, personable service and great decor inside and patio/ garden outside!  The menu prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. The skillets are excellent!!  Definitely check it out :)"}
{"text":"Love Yolis. Great food in a down home cozy diner atmosphere. Nice people. Burgers are good. Try the \"Shon Burger\" named after yours truly. Jalapeño, Feta and Avocado. Good stuff. Breakfast is very good. Fresh corned beef hash made from scratch. The hash makes me happy every time I eat it. Seriously, if you think happiness can't be bought, try the hash."}
{"text":"Beyond Excellent and attentive service. The food was very delicious. I had the monte cristo and found that it was perfect and tasted great. The outside patio is great too"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Great service. They do tacos and burgers really well. Sandwiches are mediocre but the price isn't bad, so they are still a decent choice. Good place for a quick lunch if you aren't wanting fast food or a full-on sit down restaraunt."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and staff!!! The restaurant is at what used to be an old home and has a lovely outdoor seating area with cafe lights and landscape. Perfect place to cozy up with a cup of joe and great food. There are also some rescue birds that you can walk around and see after your meal. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"So, when you find it.. and you see it's a house you might think.. okay, let's go to wildflower instead. however, trust your instinct and stay. Inside is small, and simple. . The ladies working there are all upbeat, funny, sweet, and listening to the hits RnB singing while they work. My boyfriend and I loved it! The food! the food is delicious. The mornin' monte is so good and the homemade marmalade is great. French toast, yummy! hawaiian sweet bread french toast? Sign me up. the whole experience was amazing from this little homemade hole in the wall place that our waitress said the food is made with 'love and happiness.' and that's exactly what we got. A+!"}
{"text":"Morning Monte was really good!! Driving up seeing the outside we weren't to sure if we wanted to stop but once inside it looked fine and the food was so good. Good prices and good coffee we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to Yoli's and will be my last.  I was craving a chorizo  omelet however they only have a chorizo barrito and a chorizo skillet- whoops.   I asked the waitress if I could get the Green Eggs and Ham Omelet but with chorizo instead of the ham.  The waitress said sure but then asked if I wanted the ham too because \"she will likely still charge you extra for the chorizo\"- red flag.  Omelet was better than Brunchies across the street- that was before the flies started attacking; we were sitting on the patio.  As promised by the waitress (who was great by the way so don't take your [\"she\"] \"money before the customer\" mentality out on her), when the bill came there was a $2.29 up-charge on my $6.99 omelet for replacing the ham with chorizo- an outrageous overcharge and poor decision given the shortsightedness of not having a chorizo omelet on the menu.   The \"money before the customer\" mentality might be a good short term solution to increase your bottom line, but as you now know it is bad for building good Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Yoli's has recently been popping up on Yelp's 'Best Of' front page. Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself.  My previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.  When it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.  Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.  The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasn't blown away with Yoli's but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book.  I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about. Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us. Good Luck!!"}
{"text":"Loved this quaint little breakfast spot.  We went on a Monday morning, but I can imagine this place is pretty busy on weekends.  Great service and prices and the food was very good.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went in for brunch with my wife. She's been here a lot of times. I had the Uptown Bagel egg sandwich on Everything Bagel. The sautéd shrooms and spinach were perfect. They clearly craft each order for a \"home cooked\" feeling."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem in downtown Chandler...home cooking type comforting food for me and reminds me of mama's Sunday brunch cooking."}
{"text":"If someone was ever looking for a home made breakfast in a restaurant, look no further. Set in a house a family, or a date feels at home stepping into Yoli's for a late breakfast or an early lunch. The food is simple, and filling, yet not overdone. The atmosphere is friendly, and during the spring months the back patio cannot be beat."}
{"text":"We found an excellent brunch spot this morning in the heart of downtown Chandler! We were welcomed by all employees as soon as we walked in. Yoil's has indoor and outdoor seating and they also have a tv in one of the dining areas.  The food was great! My husband and I each had an omelette. The omelettes were big and filled with the respective ingredients. I ordered fruit instead of potatoes which included strawberries, grapes, blueberries, and pineapples. Far better than the average melons. My daughter ordered the Hawaiian French toast which was delicious! How can you go wrong with Hawaiian bread and cinnamon?!  The prices are very reasonable. Our plates were each under $10.  Glad we found this spot and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love Yolis.. Small, calm, quite with great food and good prices. This is now one of our weekend go-to haunts!"}
{"text":"Other than waiting 40 minutes for breakfast we liked it.  Nice menu with good food. Server was friendly and attentive.  I had the monte which was good other than the lack of crispy bacon.  My own preference.  Kids loved the French toast."}
{"text":"Hmmm, let's see... when was the last time I went to the same place for breakfast 3 days in a row before Yoli's?  NEVER!!!    Fantastic food, great service, great prices, cool outdoor seating.    You MUST try the french toast, and biscuit/gravy.  yeah, I usually don't get those together either, but then I'd never been to Yoli's..."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Layout inside kinda sucks, but is actually a house and you can Tell. Def worth checking out"}
{"text":"Just came from Yoli's. OMG it is a gem!!! You would NEVER find it unless you looked up places in downtown Chandler.  GPS takes you to what seems like front...and you probably would not go in (looks like house).  Main entrance is actually on other side.  It serves breakfast and lunch, small, but nice, inside, and outside has a beautiful courtyard...big surprise!  Many plantings, trees, benches, parakeets, birds, cockatiels singing their hearts out!  Only 54 outside but sat at table in the sun and had to take off jacket.  Great breakfast with super friendly staff.  We will be going there once a week while we are here! Pictures they have posted DO NOT do them justice!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much the bees knees, them biscuits and gravy, with the crispy softness of the biscuits.. just tastebud heaaaveeen."}
{"text":"I'm giving Yoli's 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location.  Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.  I ordered the Morning Monte.  It was delicious.  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others' plates and everything was excellent.  My favorite item was the chorizo burro.  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also.  Another really great thing about this place is the prices.  I don't think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get.  After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.  We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.  I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items."}
{"text":"Yolis cafe is a place you would see on triple D on the Food Network.  It Is a hidden gem! The food is fantastic; the portions are good and the prices are even better!  The owner, Yolanda, walks around and makes all of her customers feel like family!  I can't wait to go back and try something else!! I strongly suggest going there!!  Your experience will be just as positive as mine!"}
{"text":"Got the Morning Monty and the Steak Buritto! Very good. Cute little place. Staff was very nice. Wish they served local or organic options though. I dig the location and it was fun to try a new place, but I usually steer clear of non-organic food. That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great service, outstanding food quality and a all around great place in downtown Chandler area."}
{"text":"Brought my mom (who was in town), son, and boyfriend here. The food was so amazing that my mom called my dad (in California) to let him know how great it was. We all enjoy good food and LOVE breakfast, so we are SO happy to have chosen this spot. It will be our ONLY breakfast place. Yoli's never disappoints. I don't know why I ever go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I have been thinking about trying Yoli's since i saw them on a morning news segment! However it was very disappointing. I had the carne asada burrito and my man had a the monte crisco sandwich and a side of potatoes. The burrito was very bland and has a strange after taste. After trying the other dishes, I realized that all the food had the strange after taste... I did not finish my meal... I've had better at filly b's. I will most likely not return. It was also uncomfortably warm in the restaurant. There are some amazing breakfast places around.... It's unfortunate that Yoli's doesn't make the grade in my opinion."}
{"text":"Yoli's is a a great place to have breakfast.  The staff is wonderful and you ALWAYS receive great customer service.  The prices are great, the food is wonderful and the portion size leaves you quite full.  I usually can't finish my meal and end up with a nice snack for later."}
{"text":"First time dining here, wow!  What a find, had the hardy omelet.  Highly recommended!  All the pictures show the diverse menu options.....yum."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Yolis Cafe. It's the only place I will actually wake up for to go to breakfast. Every single waiter/waitress I've encountered there is beyond nice and warm and welcoming.   Biscuits and gravy are the way to go. Get a mimosa from The Perch next door, and you've reached a special part of breakfast heaven that can only be found in the little nook of downtown Chandler.   Love love love this place."}
{"text":"We love to try new breakfast places and thought we'd give this a try on a whim. The place not only has very limited parking but the entrance is confusing. Once inside, the décor is sparse and utilitarian-boring. Our waitress didn't seem very thrilled. It was blistering hot out side, we had to cram inside at one of the 6 tables. I ordered the chorizo burrito and it was bland. Large portions of bland food. The cheese on top smelled like it was getting old. Overall, we won't be back and will go back to Brunchies across the street. Darn!"}
{"text":"I dined at Yoli's for the first time today at lunch.  When we arrived at 11:40 we were the only customers.  This place only has one waitress so even though our food was okay, the service was super slow.  She was very pleasant, but they need additional cooks and servers.  My friends ordered breakfast, which came almost immediately.  My tuna melt came ONE HOUR after I ordered it.  All of the other outside tables were full and nobody had any food.  My tuna melt was not special in any way, so I would say only come here if you have lots of time and  want to sit and enjoy their cute patio.  I really wanted to like this place, but between the slow service and so-so food, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"With no exaggeration, they have the best breakfast I have ever had. I have only tried the \"Volcano Style Cheddar biscuits and gravy\" but it's so dang good I don't need to try anything else. I am usually not a huge fan of biscuits and gravy, I mean I like it but would never order it normally. I found this place based off of other positive Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint! My first time here me and my friend asked what they recommended and he suggested the biscuits and gravy volcano style or the \"Mornin Monty\" which is another one of their specialties. My friend also agreed it was the best breakfast he had had before too. Love this place and I've been 5 or 6 times in a couple of months. It's kind of hard to find so definitely use GPS. It is right next to the Perch Brewery."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It has really great reviews and I love supporting local small businesses. However... my boyfriend and I didn't have the best experience. When we first walked in, it was the cutest little cafe surrounded by a courtyard with wild birds chirping. It was so beautiful! So, we decided to sit outside. We went inside to get sat and the host asked us, two for lunch? It was 11:15 am on Saturday and we wanted breakfast. We tried to explain and the host went on to tell us that if we wanted breakfast she would have to talk to the cook, because she might've put everything away. But she might be able to make pancakes? None of this made any sense but we ended up taking a lunch menu and a breakfast menu. When she came out to take our order, she continued to ramble on about how they don't think they could do breakfast. We give up and we ordered lunch. we sit for about ten minutes and another table near us gets sat. I overhear them ordering breakfast which kind of irritated me. I let it go and still hold high hopes for this monte cristo I've heard such amazing things about. What feels like a while later, we finally get our food. It's nothing special. It's really just okay. My boyfriend had ordered and pastrami on rye and it was dry and overcooked and they didn't even put the sauce on it (that's why he ordered it), so we had to ask for it. Overall, we wouldn't go back. Maybe for breakfast... lol."}
{"text":"Do not let the neighborhood or outside of the building fool you!  I decided to go here because of the reviews on Yelp but when I pulled up my wife and kids didn't want to go inside.  I said I am going to trust Yelp on this one and I am very glad I did!  Once you walk in you are greeted by a beautiful courtyard which is shared by another business which has exotic birds outside.  The staff is very friendly and the food is unique and delicious!  Have a hearty appetite because the portions are big also."}
{"text":"All the other reviews are correct. Not only is the  food delicious, but the unique open atmosphere makes it a true gem. The outside appearance prevented me from venturing here in the past & I really wish it hadn't. Came with my friend who's  a regular  and can't  wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! It's off the beaten path and provides great service and amazing food. The cheddar biscuits are so good! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp...A beautiful gem in downtown Chandler! Loved the atmosphere surrounded by chirping exotic birds nestled in a romantic garden. Was a lil nervous at first because from the outside it looked like someone's house, but once you come into the garden, it's amazing! The food was very good, the service amazing! Enjoyed the talking birds. It was romantic yet great for the family too!!"}
{"text":"Nice patio and friendly service.  Food was ok but nothing memorable.  STick to classic breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"Being new to the area I found this place through Yelp. Going through the reviews we took a chance and went. Glad we did! The food was good and the staff was so friendly, you felt right at home. The wait for the food is a while so only go if you have time to spare. We will be back to enjoy the food and the staff."}
{"text":"I've been going here over the past year since I moved to Chandler- I've never had a single dish that wasn't delicious or a single visit that wasn't top notch on customer service. Local family-run restaurant perfect for brunch and breakfast; good quality & fair prices. Get the Mornin' Monte!"}
{"text":"Churizo skillet is A MUST! I haven't had one thing thing i haven't liked & the staff is always friendly. Great \"Mom & Pop\" place for some eats.  I believe they are currently renovating but can't wait till they open back up.  Atmosphere is rustic but inviting.  You won't regret your visit!"}
{"text":"We were hoping to keep our weekend breakfast hole-in-the-wall a secret, but the word is out, \"Yoli's is great!\"  Our family eats there at least 3 times a month.  Yoli's is a family run place, with Yoli and her husband in the back cooking up the best breakfasts in Chandler.  The staff is treated like extended family and so are you once you become a regular, like us.    The one downside is the more popular they are becoming the longer the wait is to get a table or food after you order.  We don't mind.  We know this is homemade, made-to-order, good food, not a fast food joint or cookie cutter chain restaurant.  I see that some folks have complained about the wait.  I guess you can't please them all.   The inside is small, but with the great weather outside seating in the courtyard is nice and relaxing.  The owner of the property has rescued at least a couple dozen exotic birds, who talk and sing.  They are on the far side of the courtyard so they are not too loud, but it is just plain cool to go and see the conures, parrots, lovebirds, fitches, and other birds.  My kids love them.  Now the whole reason that I'm writing this review is the food.  It's damn tasty.  We love the mix and match combo of breakfast items.  You want a grand slam breakfast you order it, you want to double up on ham, done, just pick your favorites.  Make sure to get the French Toast.  I must admit it is not the healthiest food, but its amazing.  I had the chorizo burrito last weekend, hold the potato, and it was great.  I have my eye on the biscuits and gravy for my next visit."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in downtown chandler. Cozy breakfast and lunch  spot. A must try spot.  Outside patio is nice. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The Old Towne Market Square is pretty darn enchanting.    My cutie pie and hubby were suddenly surprised by the cages of birds along the meandering paths.  The early 1900's cottages are transformed into eclectic shops.  I would never have found this place.  The credit also goes to Miss Monique H.'s review as I scrambled to find a breakfast place for the boys closer to home.    Hubby ordered the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito ($5.99)  with potatoes.  I told my son that the burrito was almost as big as he was when he was born.  He beamed in ...horrible to think I likened him to a burrito. It wasn't sickeningly huge, but enough to skip lunch and have a light dinner.  It was so fluffly and moist with enough heat to tickle the taste buds.  My cutie pie picked from the KIDS MENU-he decided on the Hawaiian French Bread Sticks ($4.95).  All he wanted was a side of strawberries, which our server happily substituted.    I had to ask if the Mornin' Monte ($7.79) was similar to the deep fried Monte Christo sandwich-a friend's favorite-my nightmare.  I've never had it, but deep fried battered sandwich scares me.  I've never had a thing for Thai toast either.  They take Hawaiian bread French toasts, turkey slices, havarti, egg whites and bacon to make their Monte.  While all the flavors worked together, I miss the yolk.  Though, should thank them for less cholesterol overkill.  Spicy marmalade....yum!  I noticed they serve AZ raised Angus beef on their burgers...must try next time!  We found a Sunday breakfast fave!!!"}
{"text":"I had the steak and eggs, they  were good. This is a whole in the wall place but the people there make you feel welcome. With my grading of food it's either good or not. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have yet to try something at Yoli's that I did not enjoy. The chorizo skillet, green eggs & ham omelet, French toast, and cheddar biscuits are just a few highlights. My bf & I have been going here for Sunday breakfast for over 6 months now, we love it...the courtyard, the food, the staff, the ladies singing in the kitchen! :) The only reason I hesitated before giving a 5 star review is the more people that try it, the less chance I have of getting my favorite window table on Sunday."}
{"text":"Very nice little place with pleasant decor and a small patio for dining outside in the shade. 6 stars for friendliness! The owners and their employees give new meaning to nice as they greet all as if they were old, dear friends. Food was solidly good if not great. I had the green eggs and ham and while good it had a bit too much green which drowned out any other flavors. Had a very nice biscuit  with a good crumbly texture and buttery flavor. Hashbrowns were well browned and of good quality. My wife had the bagel with eggs, spinach and Havarti and it was very tasty. My wife is a very good cook and her comment was that it was \"just like she would have made it herself\". High praise indeed. All in all a good place to which we will return."}
{"text":"Eat at Yoli's!   Great food!    Great Service!   Great prices!  Yoli's is VERY close to work so I stop in a few times a week. The employees are very nice and let us call our orders in ahead and they have it ready for us when we get there.  I have tried many items on the menu and liked them all. They have  different homemade desserts ever time I stop in. (Muffins,Cookies,Cakes)  I really like this place!!  You will be impressed!"}
{"text":"I have been coming her for years, waitress knows my order, all that jazz.  Recently tried the breakfast sandwich and I'm hooked! Try it with egg whites, havarti, and bacon-- it's killer!!!"}
{"text":"The omelettes are giant and filled with fresh delicious vegetables. The French toast is no joke either, I think they're sprinkled with magic. The pancakes are giant and soooo good. I'm pretty sure anything you order will be super tasty."}
{"text":"Yoli's is easily in my top favorite breakfast restaurants. I usually go with my gf Saturday or Sunday mornings and get the mix and match. You can pick from several items and I usually get the standard egg, sausage, has browns with one pancake. And, this pancake is just about perfect. It's big, fluffy and cooked to a light and slightly crispy golden brown. You don't even have to use syrup. Recently, I tried the Morning Monte which I am definitely getting next time. The flavor is exquisite. Just about everything on the menu is worth ordering.  The restaurant is tucked away in a garden oasis in downtown Chandler. We wouldn't have found it except for all the popular Yelp reviews. They have a good amount of outdoor seating nearby a quaint arrangement of flowers, plants and birdcages that house several exotic and colorful birds. It's worth going just to check out those lil guys.   The only downside is that the kitchen is small, so when the brunch rush hits, it can take a while. But Yoli and her staff are so friendly and pretty honest about the wait. We grab coffee and sit it out. Trust me, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I eat here nearly every morning.  It's so refreshing to have a place that feels like home.  Yoli and company not only serve a great meal, but they know how to treat customers right."}
{"text":"I continue to search for the best breakfasts in the area and Yoli's is above average. Based on recommendations I tried the breakfast monte. It was good. It isn't a true monte Cristo style sandwich as it's made up of two pieces of French toast with the goodies sandwich between. But it was good. The chili marmalade really made it. I would've liked the egg whites to taste less smelly eggy (that smell when an egg is over cooked) and more buttery but that's just me. Definitely will go back and try some other items. Their lunch menu looks yummy too."}
{"text":"Been going to Yoli's since it opened..Love it!  I have been told by friends that they have the best hamburgers, so I finally broke down (since I'm not much of a burger guy) and tried one with skepticism.  I now think they need to change their name from Yoli's to YUMMY'S Cafe! Holy cow (no pun intended) it was Awesome! Has to be the juiciest most flaverful burger I can remember eating. Not sure I can order anything else now."}
{"text":"We were a bit hesitant to go inside when we pulled up but man oh man.. I am so thankful that we did. Amazing food, great service, good vibes and low prices! I HIGHLY recommend the volcano biscuits and gravy or the morning Monte. Some of the best breakfast/brunch food that I have ever had! We will definitely be regulars. Plus, the Perch (an awesome bar) is right next door- so you can walk right over and grab a drink!"}
{"text":"Cute breakfast place. The area seems a bit sketchy, but the food and service was excellent here!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times. We've also tried to come a few times that they were closed- so we ate at the perch instead. They have great breakfast with good portions. The only thing that could be better is their service. The waitresses seem a little annoyed to be there- which can make your brunch go from happy to uncomfortable in no time at all. A smile can go along way in the service industry!"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Fantastic service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall. The chef even came out to ensure we were enjoying our food. Great service, great food, would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Yoli's so many times I can't count them all! Our go to breakfast is the Chorizo burrito, it's huge, delicious, and always fresh. My favorite lunch time meal is a tie. I usually order the grilled ham and cheese (yes I'm an adult, but it's soooo yummy), and the Luau Pulled Pork. The pork sandwich comes on this roll but they toast it (delicious) and it has a crunchy coleslaw with pineapple and jalapeños in it! Are you hungry yet? What I love even more is that you can order their amazing steak fries or if you want to be healthy they offer cottage cheese as a side. As you can read I'm a huge fan and we will keep visiting Yoli's!"}
{"text":"Hidden Little Gem, do yourself a favor and try this place. I usually go on the weekends and sometimes they get busy but the staff has always been friendly and the food is some of the best. Not one person I've recommended try this place has been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've came across this place on Yelp before and always wanted to give it a try...But I got lost somehow and couldn't find the location and just gave up lol. Well I  finally found Yoli's on Google maps one day and I guess I know why I missed it the first time because it's in a run down area of Chandler and the restaurant is actually an old house. I ordered the garden skillet with raisin bread toast and their famous Morning Monte Sandwich. Presentation wise, the food didn't look really presentable. There's a hype on Yelp of their Morning Monte and it's basically french toast with eggs and bacon (BTW the bacon looked like it's been left out all day, definitely not fresh). The garden skillet was OK but I had better breakfast skillet elsewhere. I just felt like something was missing. The service? Um...OK as well. Our food took forever and I was just sipping on my coffee...next thing I know I was sitting there with an empty coffee cup for about 10 minutes or so. I had really high expectations for this place because of the yelp reviews, but I was a bit disappointed and I honestly thought the food was comparable to IHop or Dennys IMO..."}
{"text":"Friendly service, and great food! The country potatoes were perfectly cooked, and my chorizo, egg , and potato burrito was excellent."}
{"text":"Yoli's Cafe delights and delivers!  Awesome biscuits & gravy, really tasty french toast, and a delightful location.  This tiny little cafe is tucked into a neighborhood setting, attached to old downtown Chandler.  I have had breakfast and lunch at the cafe and am happy with all the food I had.  My first day, I ordered the hearty skillet and was pleasantly surprised by their delicious biscuits and gravy.  I actually ordered the gravy on the side as I am not always a fan of biscuits and gravy, but this stuff was AH-MAZE-ING!  I waddled out of the restaurant a happy camper, especially at the low prices they charged (even before the yelp check-in 10% discount!)  The next time I went I tried the french toast.  I am somewhat of a french toast snob, and yet... they did not disappoint.  It was golden and delicious with a touch of sweet.  The sausage they serve at Yoli's is also fantastic!  I was super delighted and again, left happy and full!  On my third trip, I arrived a bit too late for breakfast, but my girlfriends and I decided to try out their lunch menu.  My friend and I had the monte cristo, and my other friend had a beef sandwich.  We were all happy with our sandwiches, though I could have wished for a side of fries or cole slaw to come with the cristo.  My friend ordered onion rings rather than fries to go with her beef sandwich and this was a superlative move; the onion rings were crisp and tasty.    The only downsides I've experienced is that if the place is busy you could be waiting for quite a while to get your food; if you prefer to sit outside, you may be in the sun; and the place is very small so it fills up fast.  However, the menu here has certainly delighted me, the staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere is beautiful.  You really couldn't ask for much else!"}
{"text":"What an awesome breakfast !!!!!!!!!! That cook is F'n FANTASTIC !!!!!!!! Been eating here for a month now and I have had no complaints about the food !!!!!  The wait time maybe , but that just goes to show how good this place is"}
{"text":"OK, Megan!  Although we've never met I saw your review and took your advice to come here!  We actually showed up late enough to be called \"brunch\".  I ordered the pulled pork from the lunch menu.  Also ordered by our table was the chorizo burrito (breakfast) and the French toast combo.  I am told the burrito was really good.  The French toast was \"good but nothing special\", as were the eggs and ham.  My pulled pork and fries also was good.  I like Joe's better for the pulled pork, but this was different.  Sort of sweet and spicy.  I'd give it 3 stars, frankly.  The fries were cooked perfectly.  Crunch on the outside, tender on the inside, but the seasoning was almost non-existent.  Still good, but not great.  I can see trying this place again and ordering something different.  I went with 4 stars mostly because I'm told the burrito was really good.  My pork, and my wife's French toast combo were probably only 3 or 3.5 stars.  So I rounded it."}
{"text":"So, we just saw your story on the news...we're heartbroken and so sorry to hear of the theft.  We will come twice as much;))).  You're awesome and we support you!  Stay strong...  Xoxo"}
{"text":"This cafe was such a nice experience from the atmosphere to the service and the food was outstanding. We will definitely be back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Great food, nice service.  In an interesting place but we liked it.  There is a bird sanctuary of sorts next door that provided some scenery too!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast!  Great variety on the menu, well prepared.  The staff is always very attentive, personable and nice.  Like going to a good friend's for a meal more than a restaurant.  The location is not on the beaten path, which is actually even better."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for me. And Yolis Café will always be my go-to spot for anything delicious. This review is long overdue but this place is so consistent with amazing food & service, I have to give them credit where it's deserved.     They have the sweetest most attentive servers around. We have had multiple different people serve us before & every single one is great. Always keep your coffee mug or drinks full. Check on you a few times to make sure things are going well. And when you have well trained employees you know management is organized and keeps their people happy.     I literally get the same thing to eat every time I visit, the hearty skillet. But every time we bring friends or family, no one is disappointed in the food. And they bring it out so quickly! I love supporting local restaurants and this one is my all time favorite. Try it out & you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"2nd visit..  I had the hamburger.  It was a good soft bun, patty cooked the wY I like, plenty of free add on's such as cheese ,mushrooms  etc.. the thick cut steak fties, dill seasoned were good. They have really good iced tea. Some  places water 5he tea down so much it's only flavored water. I am on a mission to try the whole menu."}
{"text":"This place has better than typical breakfast food with the coolest people working here.  Far better than average food, GREAT service, nice little patio = I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly owners take great care of you. The chorizo burrito is excellent, I enjoy having an occasional breakfast here. The location is a bit tricky to find a block off of Arizona Avenue on Wall Street. Be sure to track this place down and give it a try."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast. We go on Sundays and the staff is awesome and the food is great. My wife loves the biscuits. I am always amazed at how fast we get our food. I feel like they know what I want before we get there and have it ready and waiting. It is a small place but they have down some nice expansions outside. Please go support a local Chandler business and say hi to Yoli while you are there."}
{"text":"Food and service were both amazing.  Large portions make it so you get your money's worth!  Small, mom & pop feel and charm.  Plenty of breakfast favorites and al a carte menu options.  If we could eat here every day, we would.  Instead, I'll have to settle for leftovers (great reheated by the way)."}
{"text":"From the outside, this place looks like a normal home on a quiet street. But then you walk through the gates into the \"backyard,\" and you enter a large open space featuring many large umbrella patio tables, shrubs, chirping birds, and trees.   The monte cristo french toast was more of a spiced/flavored toast rather than the traditional soft french toast. It came with this spicy orange marmalade sauce that balanced the salty bacon/turkey between the bread. It tasted great, but it's better suited for lunch rather than breakfast."}
{"text":"This place just opened and is located behind Gangplank (where I work a lot) and Yoli's brought in some breakfast samples for us to try out - good stuff btw!  A handful of us (12) decided to go over for lunch and check it out.  Location is somewhat hidden in the little market just west of Arizona Ave and north and between of Frye and Chicago St.  Nice little older house looking place, with a nice patio that's shaded and enclosed in the little market area.  Inside is all redone and very clean with new tables and chairs. They do take debit and have a soda machine for refills.  Food is very homemade American cafe/deli style with good burgers. Currently since they just opened they don't have menus other than large notecards with today's menu, which works well actually. Had about 10 different choices...   I went with the turkey bacon sandwich w/ American cheese on sourdough. Very good no complaints at all. It did take a little bit since we slammed them with 12 people right away on their first day but they held in and everything came out within a reasonable time and with no mistakes at all even with all the custom orders w/ the burgers we had. They use little baskets for the food and have metal silverware. OOOH and pickles... crisp too, not soggy and floppy :)  I had some time to talk to the two owners and they're very nice and personable and were more than happy we showed up even though we swamped them a bit. Very nice ladies and without a doubt I and the rest of us at Gangplank will return frequently.  I say get down here and try it out."}
{"text":"I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  It's a quaint little diner with modest décor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!  I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know."}
{"text":"Just got back from my second trip to Yoli's in less than 7 days.  That's how good it is!  My first trip was late on Saturday morning and I immediately fell in love with the outdoor patio/courtyard area.  It was a tad too hot to sit outside, so we opted to sit indoors.  We sat looking out over the patio and Yoli and Vanessa (owner/cook and waitress/front of house, from what I can gather) were immediately friendly and welcoming.  They specialize in breakfast and lunch and we got the carne asada skillet and the carne asada breakfast burrito.  I would have liked the burrito to be a little more spicy than it was, but they make their own pico and marinate their own carne, so it was still pretty yummy.  You'll also see later on, that they are totally open to customizations, because you can tell they aim to please.  Went back for lunch today and sat in the courtyard.  Such a beautiful area that is tucked away on the side of Arizona Avenue just south of the 'new' downtown Chandler.  Yoli came out and brought us a complimentary plate of apple crumble that she had made that morning - what a nice touch!  We got to talking about the menu and we found out that we have the same love for Spam that we picked up from our childhood upbringing.  She said that on Monday's they do Spam & eggs (with white rice) - which is one of my all-time favorite breakfasts... hard to find in a restaurant.  She said she didn't have the white rice at the moment, so then she got to thinking and decided to make me a Spamburger.  She did spam, melted american cheese, fried egg, and a grilled tomato on top on a burger bun.  MMM!  A new menu item totally made up on the spot, and it was soooo delicious.  She gave me a side of fresh fruit (apples, peaches, grapes), and served us pineapple infused water.  I love the \"island\" theme to their menu... they use a lot of pineapple in their dishes and insist on using fresh fruits.  So hard to find in restaurants nowadays.  My lunch buddies ordered the Cali Wrap with the Cole Slaw.  Can't speak for the wrap, except that it looked very yummy.  I got a taste of the slaw and it had a nice kick to it (from the green chili's or jalapenos they put it in).  I'm not a fan of cole slaw, but this was good and I would order it next time.  I'm excited to make Yoli's my new Go-to breakfast and lunch spot.  They don't get much traffic because of their location, but they've got everything going for them:  good atmosphere, good menu, good service.  I must confess, I like that they aren't so busy, because then I can really settle in and feel at home.  But I know they need to be busy to be successful, so I hope things start picking up for them.  I can't wait until November when they start opening up on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Stopped by at 1pm on Sunday, cool, friendly vibe, but unfortunately they were changing from breakfast to lunch and said it would be 45 min wait for food. We were too hungry to wait, but since they were so friendly and honest, we'll come back and try again."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and for a second there we could not locate it. Keep looking, its there.  It is definitely a hole in the wall and if it weren't for the service, we would have given it a 5. There was 1 waitress for all the tables during lunch rush.  We had the monte cristo and the luau sandwich. Both were delicious. Only suggestion- add some cool options to the kids menu.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Despite the modest appearance from the street, Yoli's is a real find. Thank you, Yelp! While visiting PHX, and lost and hungry, I searched Yelp for the closest breakfast place. We parked with some trepidation. Walking through the gate, we entered breakfast heaven. Great food, awesome service, good coffee. If I lived in Phoenix, I'd eat here multiple times a week."}
{"text":"It was okay. If you're in a hurry, don't go here. This is a mom and pop place. Literally a house with seats on the patio. I enjoyed eating outside since it was sunny but not hot. However, I didn't enjoy that there are like 5 flies flying over my food. They are dog friendly so that's a plus too. On the food, it was forgettable. The french toast was good but not great. It'll be better with no hashbrowns. Maybe because they were bust when we went in this morning but mine was cold and too hard.  But yeah overall they were just okay. The only thing that stood out to me was their green apple smoothie. Will I come back? Sure, maybe, but not soon."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning and no problem getting a table on the patio. We absolutely loved all the food and the service was very friendly and quick! The Hawaiian French toast was so good! The chocolate chip pancake we had for the table was amazing. My husband really liked his breakfast San which on a croissant and my dad loved the hearty skillet. You really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Have not had a bad time here yet!! I LOVE everything I order here. Such good food! and really fun area sitting outside with our doggie."}
{"text":"After a bachelor party, my friends and I needed some sustenance. It had been a night of heavy drinking and debauchery with the hired entertainment.  This place is a pretty nice hidden gem. The first time, my friends and I thought it was pretty ghetto because from the rear it looked like you were going into the back of someone's apartment or backyard but it became apparently. We parked off to the side in case GPS had steered us wrong and we needed to run fast, heh.   The actual cafe is small. There is seating inside and patio furniture outside and a clear view of The Perch for some after breakfast boozing. I know we had just drank excessively but sometimes you need to bite the dog that bit cha'. Y'know?   In any which case, my friends got breakfast options which looked delicious and for all purposes they stated that the breakfast they had was delicious, however, I jumped straight to lunch. Carne Asada burrito for me. It came after 10 minutes and was pretty huge. Sprinkled with cheese and topped with slices of avocado, I dove headlong into the burrito with their delicious green chili salsa. It wasn't spicy but added good flavor with the jalapenos I had them add into the burrito. The burrito was pretty good. Not greasy like FiliB's and was pretty filling.  I would definitely recommend this place. It's close by and when the time is right, you can easily scooch over to The Perch for some drinks. We've been coming here for breakfast ever since."}
{"text":"Am I still in Arizona? This place is right out of the University District in Seattle. The garden patio seating is is so peaceful, and not like anything else you are going to find around here.  Come here uptight, eat some fantastic award winning food, get some good vibes, and leave feeling alright out of sight. I was able to substitute grilled chicken breast for the hamburger patty . Had some sauteed spinach and avocado with it. The onion rings were yummy.  I am taking a picture of the back enterance  to the restaurant. It is hot as blazes out here! I guess I'm still in Arizona after all. Do not let  the unglamorous parking throw you off. Be brave, and walk right in. I have to get in my car and crank up the AC before my brain melts.  Don't forget to check out the Amazon birds!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time and were very pleased with our experience.  The French toast was delicious, and my husband had the veggie burrito.  All ingredients tasted very fresh.  We also really enjoyed the staff.  They were very friendly and very accomodating.  We will definitely be back because we want to try the lunch."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I hadn't read the reviews prior to my lunch here. I understand that we probably went at an odd hour, 2pm, but there was no wait at all. We sat outside and it was beautiful. The server was nice, attentive, and we felt like we were her guests at home.   The menu has a great variety but not enough to be overwhelming. I got the egg salad sandwich with fries, my bf got the steak sandwich with fries. The food was delivered fast. Seriously it was about 15 min at most and the food was fresh as can be.  The fries were enough reason to return...crispy perfection seasoned and thick. Our sandwiches were perfect. I thought to myself now this is something I can feel myself craving again.   Great prices, about $22 total for both and we left stuffed.   It was tricky to find but it's right by the perch but off to the back side. Enter from Oregon street and walk in thru the gate...it will be on your right.   Going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Yolis is a quaint little place. The atmosphere is always positive and the food is amazing. My father and I have made this a regular go to spot when we can't decide where to go to eat. The Cheddar Biscuit and Sausage Gravy is amazing especially when you get it volcano style (tipped with chorizo). The hearty scramble is also a good go to skillet. All in all I recommend this place to everyone I can."}
{"text":"I was just traveling through Phoenix from LA, and I came across this little place. As you pull up, you think it's someone's house... But it kinda is, which makes it even better! The waitress was super nice and attentive. I ordered a skillet with veggies, and French toast with berries and cream. The food was amazing! It tasted just like a fresh, home-cooked meal. I'd recommend this place to anyone. Even if you're located in Phoenix, it's WORTH the drive."}
{"text":"Great service, great food for the price. Make sure to check out the aviary in the courtyard."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Yoli's ever since I heard it went in where the Better Than Sex Cakes and Cafe used to be, about six years ago according to the waitress. Somehow I just never got there, probably because they close at 3 and I don't often get out to run errands and have a bite to eat before then. Just not an early starter (plus I was out of town for two years).  My daughter was available for lunch the other day so I suggested we go to Yoli's so I could finally try it out.   We were both very impressed with it. The service was great, everything was clean, and the food was delicious. My daughter got a turkey sandwich with bacon and there was almost more bacon than sandwich! She was happy and I was jealous. I got biscuits and gravy with two eggs over easy, something I hadn't had for a long time. That biscuit was one of the best biscuits I've ever eaten. The texture was perfect, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and it didn't get all soggy when the gravy was over it. The eggs were cooked perfectly. We were both very happy with our meal and I would highly recommend Yoli's to anyone who is looking for a good place to go for breakfast or lunch.   The only thing that made me sad was looking over to where my favorite rubber stamp store used to be which is now a bar and grill called The Perch. I definitely want to try it sometime also but it still makes me sad because I had so many good times in the rubber stamp store, Stampworks."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Hidden gem.  It's not your regular sit down restaurant but kind of meandering around their location.  It's best for smaller groups and families.  Kids love it!  We've liked everything served!  I'm always happy to find a local restaurant versus a chain!"}
{"text":"Seriously you do not need to wait 1 hour after being seated to have breakfast delivered.   While this place is very charming, it is understaffed and the wait is outrageous for service and food.   After arriving at almost noon on a Saturday 11/9/13, we waiting 20 mins for a table, which in itself is more than reasonable for a table. The service took a while to greet us and eventually we were given menus and ordered breakfast.   Now we waited another 20 mins after ordering and the server who was friendly asked if we needed anything. Yes, food! She went to check on our order and came back and said it would be another 40, yes FORTY MINS for our simple breakfast order to arrive.   Shame on you for making customers wait over an hour to eat. This was not shared before sitting down! I overheard other customers also discussing long waits.   Do not go to this restaurant if you're looking for a quick or even timely meal and do not expect much from the service either."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is fantastic! A home renovated into a cute mom and pop cafe, complete with an outdoor patio. The food was amazing, I ordered the hearty breakfast skillet, biscuits and gravy on top of hasbrowns and eggs - YUMMMM! The hubs ordered (some catchy breakfast name that I can't remember)-platter with a three egg omlete, country potatoes, and bacon - I wasn't a fan of the country potatoes (mostly because I have a stub nose to anyone's country potatoes except for my grandmothers) yet the omelete was perfectly cooked, the added veggies burst with favor! Bacon....everyone loves bacon, it is very hard to mess up so it was, as expected delicious. Moving forward, we noticed a table next to us being served with big fluffy French toast. Obviously, we were forced to flag down our waitress and order that as well. Our waitress was attentive, kind and always on the ball. On two occasions I was finishing my drink as she brought my replacement to the table. (In my option every restaurant should be taught this) Let's get back to that french toast, HOLY FRENCH TOAST! Crispy on the outside, fluffy and decadent on the inside. This place is served so simply, yet packed full of flavor.  After our meal, we were just getting up to leave and a woman, who has been working the register all morning and chatting with whomever was walking by, adding laughter to the atmosphere. She introduced herself as Yoli the owner then asked us how our meal was, where we are from, what we do for a living, she seemed to generally care about what we were saying. We stayed and talked for a few minutes and left with a hug! You can't get that at Denny's! I felt as though I was leaving my sisters place after brunch. I would definitely recommend this place! Its been about a month since I visited and I have not stop talking about it....I think its time to revisit!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! The food was so awesome and the staff was really friendly. I would definitely recommend ordering the biscuits and gravy \"volcano style\" with the chorizo - seriously amazing. Their take on a Monte Christo was also really good. Would definitely recommend this place if you are anywhere near Chandler!!"}
{"text":"Love supporting local businesses!  They have a good menu selection and variety of teas to choose from.  Service and prices are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Just got back from breakfast at Yoli's. What a great hidden gem! The Carne Asada burrito was super delish. Tender chunks of seasoned beef, tasty pico on the side, and friendly, real people. I'll be back to work my way through this extensive menu real soon."}
{"text":"Gotta love Yoli's. Friendly atmosphere and located in a cute courtyard. Since the first time I went, I felt like a regular and I really like that. If you're impatient and looking for the fastest service, this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking for a warm, pleasant, relaxing place with EXCELLENT french toast. This is definitely the place. :)"}
{"text":"The French toast on my sandwich for lunch was absolutely delicious! However, I cannot say I am a fan of the monte cristo. French toast to me needs to be seperate from eggs. I love me some good french toast. I figured Id give it a shot. Just not my thing all together. I ate everything separate from one another.  My boyfriend loved his pastrami sandwich he said.  I cannot wait to go and try breakfast!"}
{"text":"Very tiny and kinda unkempt place in a  working class neighborhood. Lots of poor birds cooped up in miserable cages on the patio. We arrived at 11 am ish and spent over an hour waiting for our breakfast in the sweltering heat. Servers nice enough, food fine but really an hour? WTHeck? So... not worth the wait, over rated big time. SKIP IT!"}
{"text":"This is such a secret garden type spot -- lovely patio area, which I will try out when it is cooler next month.  We were seated quickly at 9am on a Sunday morning.  Wait staff very attentive and kept me posted on our food's progress.  Everything was very \"fresh and clean\" -- blueberries (TONS) in the pancakes were juicy and fresh, lots of fresh veggies in the omelette, (I'm sure) homemade cinnamon-raisen toast to die for...  ONLY downside was the really long wait for the food.  I had my three young kids with me and luckily I had lots to keep them busy because it was a long wait.  But we will be back, with our toys in tow..."}
{"text":"I would love to give Yoli's a higher rating but there were different factors that occurred that morning.   When we arrived they were closing early and had very little left on their menu as they were reviewed by a local TV station and ran out of food.  That is a good thing they were receiving recognition but not good for someone who was stopping in for the first time. We decided to sit outside on the patio, water began to leak from the roof and you had to move to a different seat.  They blew it off as \"oh well\", when food arrived, I was not impressed with what they had to offer.  The food had little flavor.  It is hard to give a fair rating because they did not have their popular foods available.  It was disappointing that we paid $ for an average meal. We will try Yoli's again soon, we are hoping it is Wonderful!"}
{"text":"After a morning workout I was starving and did a search on best Breakfast Burrito in Chandler: Yoli's came in near the top and I had never heard of it.  I stopped in and met Yoli who walked me through the menu.  when I was indecisive between he carne asada or chorizio, she recommended a combo.  One word: AMAZING!  Fresh pico with jalapenos, light cheese, and marinated beef/sausage were a perfect combination.  The spot is well hidden (which may hurt in the long run), but the place is spotlessly clean and charmingly cute.  Asian chairs, black counter tops, and a warm feeling make this place my new breakfast place!"}
{"text":"As a recommendation I really wanted to like this place, but now I'm just going to have to avoid mentioning that we tried it out to my friend to prevent her from hearing an unsavory review.   It was pretty busy when we arrived and though there was an available indoor seat we decided to wait for an open patio seat. After a 20 minute wait we were about to be seated by our hostess when the waitress asked us what our names were, stating a large family, that we saw come in after us, was first. Our hostess knew this to obviously not be true and sat us. The waitress followed and in front of us restated that the family was first. Taking our order she was rude and snotty.Our food took an HOUR to come out since the waitress put the family's order in first!  I don't have much to say about the food since it was  mediocre at best, stuff you would cook at home. I  ate 1bite of my French toast as it was drying and gritty. Only exceptional item was the biscuits.  I'm glad we went just to be able to find out about a the place next door, the perch. It looked much better kept, had a lush garden, and tasty looking food. I think we will be trying that place and hopefully forget all about yolis."}
{"text":"Best little place ever... Loved the food!!  Staff really nice and friendly...  We had the Monty and the Chorizo Omelette! Definitely making this our Sunday after church spot :)"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for awhile now and the consistency in great service and great food keeps us coming back. The biscuits are a must!"}
{"text":"I'm doing it! 4th time here & every meal-awesome! I've tried the Monty, French toast, chorizo skillet & asada breakfast burro. Delish!!!!! Owners awesome & staff is fantastic. Way to go!!!"}
{"text":"Far from what I expected after reading reviews on here. The area is cute, and I love the fountain with all the bird cages around, and the food was good, but when I have to wait over 40 minutes when there are maybe 8 tables, something isn't right. The food was good, and almost worth me going back, but myself, and the table next to us waited at minimum forty minutes for our food after order. Also, I noticed my on my bill, that I payed $4 for a kids meal when the menu says $3.50. Menu says $1.50 for a small chocolate milk, but I payed $2 for it. I could be wrong, but I think I got over charged ( duh ). So yeah, if you do decide to go, go early, and check your bill thoroughly."}
{"text":"If you want great food and great experience then Yoli cafe is your spot.  The breakfast was great tasting and plentiful.   From the burritos to the pancakes our group enjoyed everything.  The place was a total joy.  If you go you have to meet the owner Yoli......also Yolis story is an inspiration  for all women"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but it was an ok place. Not what I expected when I drove there. Nice place for breakfast"}
{"text":"What a neat little restaurant tucked in an old Chandler residential neighborhood. The owners turned an old house into a cute little cafe with excellent food and amazing service!  I had the Morning Monti which was fantastic! It is a sandwich made with French toast, eggs, turkey, and cheese. I added some maple syrup to it to make it extra sweet. What really made the sandwich was their signature French toast made from Hawaiian bread. Next time I'm probably just gonna order that because it was so darn good.     Definitely will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic, I stopped by there at random an had the cheddar biscuits and gravy with a scoop of chorizo on top.  The coffee was hot and plentiful, early on a Wednesday morning it was mostly empty.  It looks like most of the seating is outside and it is open just for breakfast and lunch.  I don't think I need to eat again until tomorrow and for only $9 it was a delicious bargain."}
{"text":"Hidden gem alert!  It doesn't look like much from the outside and it's not in the main hub of downtown Chandler. But as soon as you walk in you feel like you are in a completely different place!  The cafe used to be a small house. Not much room inside, but there are plenty of tables on the patio and in the lovely gardens. It is the perfect time of year to sit outside and take in the beauty and serenity of the gardens.  Also, there is an exotic bird sanctuary at the far end of the garden. My kids got the biggest kick out of the macaws saying \"hello\" and dancing. Luna was our favorite! We also sat and played a few games of checkers.  Our food seemed to take awhile but other than that, the service was great! Very attentive. Our server even told about the cafe, how long they have been there, how they brought the bird sanctuary in, very interesting! She also told us about the brewery that will be opening next store which we are really excited about!  And speaking of food, it was delicious! I got the Hawaiian French toast and my hubby for a breakfast burrito with fresh salsa, so good!  A few things that would make this 5 stars in my book...they need to carry non-dairy milk options. They didn't have almond or even soy. And I would have loved a cappuccino or some espresso drink. It just seems fitting with the gardens to have espresso. That would be lovely.  Overall, great spot. Family friendly, great service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is very friendly and attentive and they greet you right when you walk in the door. They're quick to serve you and don't keep you waiting for extended periods of time. I also love that it's right next to the perch, and while you're eating, you can listen to the birds morning calls. The only thing that ruins the ambience are the flies always buzzing around. I feel like something can be done to prevent them buzzing around you the entire time you're here and possibly ruining your food. I, in particular, am vey grossed out by flies simply landing on the cup that I'm drinking it of, let alone my food."}
{"text":"Having Southern roots, I am always on the prowl for the good, really flaky breakfast biscuit, a rare treat in Arizona. Yoli's delivers with a biscuit that is large, but better than large--delicious, light, and generously heaped with egg, cheese, and for me--crispy bacon. Yumm. Gets my vote for the breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"TEMPORARILY closed. Website says grand reopening is 9/15!  Please visit when it reopens! I don't want this place to close."}
{"text":"I loved this little cafe it was very cozy and the staff was very friendly there was a little bit of a wait but that is expected for a little popular cafe like this. Food was great I had the Morning Monte. My wife had the Hawaiian French toast and that was also really good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast. My wife and I are from Orange county California and have been to many great breakfast restaurants. I had steak and eggs burrito and French toast. Absolutely delicious! This place is really good and we will be back every time we visit our family here in Arizona.."}
{"text":"Moved to the area in May. In my hunt for food came across Yoli's cafe and loved the vibe and location. I have eaten here now 4 times and have had 3 good visits and 1 not so great. Food and staff are always consistently good. French toast, carne burro are favs. The one visit that was shaky was because they were too busy.Long wait times, not enough seats, etc... There success might be their curse. So be patient and if it looks too busy it is."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Fantastic people. Not sure what else there is to say. It doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that dissuade you. We had the hearty skillet, Hawaiian French toast and the boom power. Way too much food for two of us. Everything is fresh and in large proportions. Really good stuff and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"WOW!  How did we not find this place sooner?  This little out of the way cafe in Old Chandler is worth driving to from anywhere!  Their signature breakfast dish, 'The Morning Monte' is to die for.  This French Toast masterpiece is made with Hawaiian bread, egg whites, grilled turkey, havarti cheese,and bacon, served with a spicy chili marmalade.  The meal stands on its own, but the marmalade or syrup is great too!  There was no wait when we arrived, and the service was excellent.  There is a patio that resembles a small forest, and while we ate indoors, it was still quite 'cozy'.  This is our new favorite breakfast place!  We'll be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"I hate having to leave this review, but after my visit yesterday, something needs to be said. My mom was here from out of state and I wanted to take her to this place as past experiences were exceptional. I'm not sure if it's because we went on a Monday morning, but if this had been my first visit, I would never have gone back. We were the only people in the restaurant, we sat outside. I ordered a morning monte w/hashbrowns, my mom ordered French toast w/a side of bacon. The morning monte was very good, the hashbrowns were horrid; swimming in what seemed like old oil, old potatoes...I couldn't eat them and sent them back asking for another order... same thing. I think maybe leftover from the weekend?? My moms French toast was doused in butter, which she removed and her bacon had been deep fried! It had no taste whatsoever, she felt hers was leftovers from the weekend as well. To top it off, the place next door, The Perch or something like that, had decided half way through our meal, to have a  landscaper start pulling out trees, whacking bushes and adding drip lines or something RIGHT NEXT TO OUR TABLE!! They couldn't have waited 10 minutes for us to finish our meal?! After this visit, I can't imagine I'm going to drive 20 minutes to eat here again. Very sad because the first couple of times I was here it was amazing. Shame."}
{"text":"Whaaaaaat!  We love breakfast out and this is such a great little find in downtown Chandler!"}
{"text":"Found this cute little cafe on Yelp and my friends and I loved it! It was hard to find at first and my friends both parked too far away and ended up wandering a bit to find it. I parked at a small parking lot down the street, not sure if it belongs to a random apartment building.   We came here Saturday morning at 9am and it wasn't too busy yet; we didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes before we were seated! Our waitress was really attentive and helpful. I ordered the carne asada burrito and my friends ordered the chorizo skillet (comes with 2 tortillas), and green eggs and ham (comes with toast). It did seem to take awhile for our food to arrive but the time passed quickly nonetheless because we were having a good time.   I really enjoyed my carne asada burrito which is filled with tender meat, hash browns, and eggs, with a side of salsa. The salsa was a little bland so I used my favorite condiment ever: ketchup! My friend enjoyed her green eggs and ham which came out piping hot as well. I tried my friend's chorizo and eggs and liked it but agreed with him that it could have used a bit more spicy flavor.   You do need to bring your check to the front counter to pay; we waited for a bit before realizing that! They were super nice about doing separate checks. And yes the garden has character and we had fun looking at the 2 live parrots behind glass windows in a bird sanctuary. It did start getting busier when we left around 10:30am.  All in all, a lovely place for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"I really do love the food here. The breakfast is away awesome. Usually the staff and servers are wonderful. Though, when it gets busy here I wouldn't recommend waiting in line. The restaurant is very small. I went Sunday morning with my wife and they practically stacked us on top of another family's table. We were so cramped in. It was uncomfortable being so close to the people, hearing their entire conversations. When it is busy, the wait staff lacks in friendliness and great service. Although, on busy days or slow days, their food is above and beyond my expectations."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places that there are in Arizona.  The location is cool, depending on where you are coming from. It is tucked away behind a birdhouse of a restaurant.   The service is really quality. The staff is nice and friendly. Bird friendly, not for you if you are allergic to birds...seriously.  The food was to die for. Had the Chorizo burrito, Carne Asada burrito, and the Yoli's Hawaiian French Toast.  Chorizo burrito was my favorite. The chorizo has some heat but not overpowering.  Carne Asada burrito was hardy. Not as spicy as the chorizo burrito but enough to complement the steak. French Toast was a few slices of sweet Hawaiian bread. Hard to explain it without actually trying. Would suggest this if you have never had Hawaiian bread.  The surprise item on the menu is the toast, just the regular toast. Some type of rye bread or something. It is buttery, really crisp when you bite, but does not feel too unhealthy."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had since I moved to Chandler. Love the Morning Monte.  Wish they picked up the phone."}
{"text":"This is a small out of they way place with very good food and super friendly service, There homemade biscuit is excellent either with gravy or as a breakfast sandwich. Get there early and the parrots will talk to you. So much fun."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Amazing food, amazing people, and didn't I mention AMAZING FOOD!!? The chorizo skillet is deliciously mouth watering. All the workers and the owners are wonderful. I am so happy I found this place, HIGHLY recommend this place. If I could give 7 stars I would. Come check it out"}
{"text":"Never waist you time going there the service is rude the woman on the front doesn't know how to talk to people she's very stupid she need to learn how to keep her conments to her self better places around town with better services and better food and prices"}
{"text":"Found this place through a friend.  Turns out this place is actually fantastic, everything we had was great. Everything about this place was good; the environment, the staff and location. It is a little off the beaten path but so worth the search. From the moment we got there to when we left the staff was super friendly and made sure we were taken care of properly.   The only downside, and I mean only downside was that the coffee wasn't very good. It was acceptable, maybe I'm just a coffee snob but it could've been a little stronger.  After some thinking, it's not fair to give them a 4 star. They do deserve 5 stars. They actually are a great place."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat breakfast!  My fiance' and I were on our way to get some breakfast burritos.  We zigged instead of zagged, saw a sign and turned in to try it.    Yoli's is cozy, with a great group of employees.  I had the hamsteak, country potatoes, and two eggs over medium.  The fiance' had a chorizo and egg burrito, and we both had coffee.  Both dishes were simple, but very good, to include the coffee. The fiance' let me have a bite of her burrito and it is definitely one of the best chorizo and egg burritos that I have ever had, and I have ate a lot of them.  The best part of all are their prices.  Super cheap for the quality and quantity of food that you get.   Before this morning, if my fiance' and I wanted a light breakfast to start our Sundays it would usually be either breakfast burritos from a taco shop or we would go to The Coffee Shop in Gilbert.  Now we have the quality of The Coffee Shop (if not better), but without the high prices of The Coffee Shop.    I look forward to trying their skillets and biscuits  and gravy.  If you are just now hearing about this place go a try it for yourself.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in the East Valley! A hidden gem worth searching out."}
{"text":"I had the steak onion and pepper skillet with red potatoes and it was absolutely fantastic. The meat was tender and the skillet had so much flavor..let's not forget the fresh avocado slices . Boom !!"}
{"text":"Trendy atmosphere and great food, what more could you ask for? SERVICE, which place completely lacked. This is one of the first times I've walked into a place that I felt like they absolutely didn't wanted my business. Further, there was a complete disregard for sanitation. Displayed by the waitress that coughed multiple times with no attempt to cover her mouth. It also didn't help to hear her say, \"I need a break\" out loud so many times.   I'm truly sadden to rate this place as a one star, as I hope this was an off day for the staff."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very friendly staff and perfect place to sit outside. The portions are big and the breakfast items have a special extra effort they put in. Coming back to check out the lunch menu"}
{"text":"Thank goodness that Yoli's is open again.Best veggie omelet and pancakes in town.Always great service.Thanks."}
{"text":"Yoli's is AMAZING! I found this place through a review on Yelp. Yoli's is tucked away, and most likely you would NEVER know it existed, unless you heard from someone. I love the patio, it reminds me of \"The Secret Garden\" The outside ambiance is very worth it. the food is great. I have tried many things on the menu, and always a delicious experience. I recommend the pulled pork sandwich. YUM!! Jamie is awesome too! She is ALWAYS smiley and friendly :)"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about this place. Service is horrible... Showed up at 10:30AM on a Sunday and checked in at the awkward counter and was told by the hippie hostess the wait was about 20 minutes. So the wife and I graciously agreed to wait and take a stroll through the atriums and check out the bird rescue( probably the coolest part of this whole place). As we ended out our about 15 minute stroll to see the birds, the hippie hostess comes and notifies several waiting parties that she has just been notified by the cook that the wait is about an hour now. How you go from 20 minutes to over an hour is beyond me. When you figure out how to run a restaurant let the world know and we might be back... Until then, good luck!"}
{"text":"We had randomly picked this place, and, am glad we did that. Nice home cooked kinda feel. Coffee was nice and fresh. French toast was excellent. And the serving size is just the right size.  Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast. Second time here and will definitely be back. Reccomemd the combo so you can have the breakfast cravings all at once."}
{"text":"Delicious, tucked away place that has super tasty breakfast. I love breakfast sandwiches. Try the monte! It has turkey, bacon, French toast, havarti cheese, and a super tasty spicy marmalade spread. This place is non-pretentious. You can come here in sweats or looking cute and you'll fit in. Don't be afraid of the neighborhood... It's not scary but not upscale. You are also right by downtown Chandler, which is really cute!"}
{"text":"Only recently found this through Yelp - didn't even know it existed as it is tucked away of the well-beaten path. Rating based on two visits - one great, one not-so-great. But will give it another try and re-evaluate.  The owners are VERY friendly and I like that it's a family owned business, not a chain. Even if they don't live in Chandler :)  Our first visit left a great impression - food was great, pancakes, French toast, biscuits and gravy - great. Even their homemade salsa is great. Only thing I noticed is its a bit LOUD inside - noise caused by the staff, need to tone it down a bit in my opinion. But great meal, friendly people, reasonable prices - will definitely return!  Second trip, however was horrible. Quickly seated and order placed. But we noticed it was taking an inordinate amount of time for our orders to come up. And our waitress (same one as first trip) was very inattentive. We had to call her over a few times and ask what was taking so long. It took 40 minutes for our food to come up - our waitress told us it was a new cook. The scrambled eggs were basically inedible - way overcooked. Talked to the owner and she would have made it right but I didn't feel like waiting any longer, so paid the bill and assured her we'll be back to try it again.  Only other negative was again LOUD - this time caused by a table with some unruly people in the corner. I think the place is a bit of an echo chamber. I noticed two groups moved to tables further in the restaurant to get away from them. A bit annoying as they also had to wait for their meals and were still there when we left. May try sitting outside next time but it's a bit hot right now."}
{"text":"We liked and will be back again, but we could've done without staff wearing open-toe shoes in/around the kitchen. Food was good, portions were good, staff was friendly, just need to work on being TOO casual with the attire."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. I have enjoyed their amazing french toast and all the burritos are great. Parking is a little tight at times. The courtyard area is great to have a sit and enjoy some coffee."}
{"text":"It's a great little spot! The owner even came out to ask how I'd like my smoothie. Super sweet people. Cools spot and I love to support a local business"}
{"text":"Quaint set up.  ALMOST reminds me of HOT (my personal fave).  Menu items look good and there's a good variety. Newspaper on hand to read which I really like.  Courtyard/patio dining, with misters, option.  Very limited seating indoors. I had the pulled pork and it was fantastic. I will be back."}
{"text":"Have been looking forward to trying this place but had to resort to a Sunday morning to go order on my way to work.  Will plan to come back on a calmer weekday to enjoy the lovely surroundings on the patio.  My wait for food was 35 mins, but I feel that is to be expected at a good breakfast place on Sunday mornings.   The staff seemed friendly and happy, as I could hear kitchen staff belting out \"Love is a Battlefield\" to the radio.  In order to sample the menu, I ordered the Morning Monte Cristo, Hawaiian French Toast, and Biscuits and Gravy (portions are definitely large enough for sharing with the hubby).  All were delicious, and the Monte Cristo was my favorite, but I felt it seemed to be lacking a layer of flavor... Unfortunately, it seems the Spicy Marmalade failed to make it into my to-go bag, and a side of catsup was added instead.  I think with the Spicy Marmalade, the sandwich would be absolutely fantastic...will have to test that theory another day."}
{"text":"Beyond delicious!!! This is a must place if you're passing through Chandler! Gotta say this is one of the BEST places I've eaten at in the Phoenix area!   Breakfast is delicious and the service is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Go early! It gets pretty crowded on the weekends, but we usually go between 7 and 8:00 and never had to wait. As others have mentioned, the Hawaiian French toast delicious. I don't eat meat so I usually get the vegetarian breakfast burrito or skillet. Be sure to ask for the homemade orange marmalade- yum!"}
{"text":"This little hideaway is one of the best keep secrets in Chandler. The food is great, the service is fast and with a family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem - for sure!!  My friends and I had been visiting Phoenix and were looking for a \"non-chain\" restaurant to grab a good breakfast before we headed to the airport.  Yelpers did NOT let us down!  This place is definitely off the beaten path (in fact, I'm pretty sure it's someone's house, turned restaurant, in the middle of other houses.)  But don't let that dissuade you. The food was fantastic - the price was right - and the staff was beyond friendly.  We were a party of 6 so we took up the only large table, just off the kitchen and even the cook came out to chat with us.  LOVED everything about this place! Will definitely be going back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"My friend and I ventured out because of a segment on \"Check PLease Arizona\".  Everyone raved about the food and service.  Although the service was good, no complaints there, I didn't think the food was anything spectacular.  I ordered the Hawaiian french toast and it was basically french toast with pineapples...I've made this at home and honestly, it was much better.  Sorry Yolis, I was really hoping for something to WOW me..."}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast. My boyfriend and I eat here every weekend. There is no wait and the staff is  very attentive. I love the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Cute little diner in a quiet neighborhood walking distance from downtown Chandler. Nice options, I got the veggie skillet and he got the hearty one. Each plate varies from $9-$12. You can take muffins and cookies to go too! Stuff is really friendly."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Yoli's.   Let's start with the location; Off the main downtown square a bit, it's hidden in a lovely secret garden where it shares a courtyard with The Perch. Parking was plentiful and easy.   The interior of the cafe is cute and very much like my granma's old house in Chandler. It's bright, friendly, and inviting.   The hostess and servers were kind and attentive. They made suggestions on the menu and gave us to-go drinks as we left.   Now to the best part; the food, oh my! The Monte Cristo lunch sandwich was heaven on a plate. The sweet flavors of the toast mingled with the saltiness of the meat and spiciness of the homemade marmalade was inspiring. The jalepeno coleslaw was a nice addition to the sandwich. The burger was also delish. The bun was buttered and slightly toasted, the burger was cooked to perfection, and the fries were thick cut and tasty. You will not walk away hungry, the portions are very generous!    I will be returning to Yoli's Cafe very soon!"}
{"text":"After reading some reviews I went ahead and gave this place a try! At first from outside I thought I was at the wrong place but nope! Inside it's a gem! It is a little bit small but it feels cozy and homie. Food was good and fresh. They make their French toast with Hawaiian bread! I say, if you ever around you should definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Some say its in a bad area and or angry that it was closed when they went , It clearly says on their website that they were closed for a couple weeks. Not to harsh anyones mellow but in this day and age its best to check the websites, social media, call before..... Yolis fits into the mom and pop / unique hip vibe, house  serving breakfast ,brunch, lunch and they do those things very well. It has been open for a long time and they take pride in their food. Great breakfast . Awesome menu. ANYWAYS... I had the veggie omelette and a Hawaiian Salad. It was devoured instantly! The veggie omelette is one of the best omelettes I've ever had, with the spinach, red peppers, mushrooms etc... Taste better than a home made one. Its got the cute home feeling and the waitress was very kind and welcoming. Beautiful outdoor seating as well with plenty of shade.. If your in the area in the morning you should definately get in there."}
{"text":"Yoli's Café is a very cute little breakfast nook in downtown Chandler. From the outside, it certainly looks sketchy. But the back patio is extremely cute and our food and service was great! Awesome pancakes and Hawaiian French Toast, and the steak and peppers skillet breakfast was absolutely delicious. For a quick, casual and cheap breakfast in Chandler, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe to get breakfast at. I came in after hiking Camelback. It has a unique atmosphere where you seat yourself and the seating are just plastic patio tables and chairs. Service was friendly and fast. They serve pretty standard American breakfast food. The food was excellent and is worth a try. I LOVED the biscuits and gravy. Overall a positive experience, the only down side was the cashier did not know how to take off 10% from our bill for checking in on Yelp. Basic math and she couldn't figure it out, a little disappointed in that it took so long to check out."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to get breakfast and lunch. Wish the place was a bit bigger and that the coffee was better, but those are small gripes.  I would suggest the breakfast skillets. They are amazing. Also, a warning, the pancakes are HUGE."}
{"text":"This place is so quaint and the people working here are sooo friendly! We brought my mother in law here for Mother's Day breakfast and the ladies were so nice and helpful with her. She has dementia and doesn't walk well and they helped her walk through the patio and brought her the kids menus which was perfect! Also brought her a cup with a lid so she wouldn't spill. Like I said so helpful and kind. I will be back and back!  Oh, and food is crazy good!!"}
{"text":"Yoli's Cafe is a little gem hidden off a side street in Chandler.  We had passed once before from trying it out, from the outside it looks like not much at all - it's in a historic house, off a side street.  Once you go into the courtyard however, it's a lovely place to enjoy breakfast.  The inside has a handful of tables.   The wait staff was probably the most friendly bunch of people I have ever been served by.  There was singing going on in the kitchen and just an atomosphere of happiness and family.    The food - yum.  I had the morning monte.  I don't do eggs, so this french toast sammy with turkey, bacon and havarti was a delish option.  It's served with a homemade orange jam - OMG.  I wanted to lick the jam cup -  I'm pretty sure I could eat this jam on anything!    Hubby had one of the skillets, hashbrowns, eggs, meats, gravy and biscuits served up in cast iron.  All the components were good - and the fresh made biscuits - YUM.   Maybe next time I have bisuits and jam.   Perfect Iced tea also - and that doesn't happen everywhere!    Plus - very reasonably priced  - 2 breakfasts, 2 drinks and a togo container of jam for around $25.   You can tell they have pride in their work and it shows in their cooking, service and attitude.  Makes you feel great about supporing a local business!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is very quaint and cute. Great place to sneak away for a private breakfast for two or a quiet getaway for one. However, the food is not that great. It's good sometimes and okay most of the time. I went there today with my sister and they got the order wrong and then my bacon was more like pork rinds or cracklin as some people call it. Not okay!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  Need to teach servers how to turn tables, prebus, etc."}
{"text":"I  really believe that my mother is in the kitchen-  I will NEVER be convinced otherwise. We were attended to as if we were of great importance (I'm in love) Information you can use: The place doesn't look like much from the street but when you go inside it's quaint with comfy outside seating. There's a nice footbridge that makes you feel like crossing into a secret little world. Staff are attentive so customer service is on 10. The food: You need to get over here yesterday..."}
{"text":"Eatery in a converted house, with passionate owners and cooks. The Breakfast Monte was outstanding, especially with the spicy orange marmalade. Great service and the food arrived quickly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't let your initial reaction to the buildings in the front discourage you from enjoying Yoli's Cafe.  Hidden behind a house and in a quaint courtyard of other personalized mom and pop stores, Yoli's is a gem in Chandler.   Sitting outside we enjoyed large steaming cups of tea and coffee.  One of us enjoyed the Country Omelet while the other had the Garden Skillet with green chilies instead of the peppers.  Great food, great atmosphere, great hostess!   We were waited on by Yoli and another young lady who were attentive and very helpful."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie! We arrived at 10am and there were only 2 other parties. The service was fast and super friendly. The Morning Monty is definitely the way to go. We also had the volcano it was also delicious! Best food experience we've had on our 2 day visit from San Diego. Don't let the exterior fool you, this is a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"So many good options for breakfast. Service is great, the staff is extremely accommodating. Food took a little long to arrive, but the free and delicious muffin was enough to hold us over"}
{"text":"Love having breakfast at Yoli's.  Try the hearty skillet!  Great food and friendly staff.  Wait can be a little long on the weekends depending on what time you go, but worth it."}
{"text":"Very cozy little breakfast/brunch/lunch spot in downtown Chandler.  The closest cross streets for Yoli's are S Wall St. and Chicago, and visitors coming here for the first time may have a hard time finding it if they don't routinely shop in the little artisan craft plaza the restaurant is in.  Once you enter, you are greeted warmly by one of the family members.  We had brunch here, and left pleasantly full and satisfied.    The meals are a very good price for the portions given.  I was especially impressed with the carne asada burrito ($6).  The burrito was gigantic, encompassing the whole plate, with a side of delicious freshly made salsa and some sour cream.  The tortilla was grilled which gave a nice added texture to the meal.  They have a \"choose your own breakfast\" option which I tried ($6.50), which comes with 2 eggs, and then 3 different breakfast selections (such as French toast, pancakes, breakfast meats, different breakfast potatoes).  Everything was prepared fresh, tasted very good, and a nice option I found was that they had sugar-free syrup for those that didn't want regular syrup.  They also have pretty good coffee ($1.75), both hot and iced.  It is smooth and rich, no hint of bitterness.    If it weren't for yelp I probably would not have even known about Yoli's, but thanks to the wonder that is the internet I now have a good breakfast spot to go to when I want to start my day off right."}
{"text":"Average food, small place-- bad a very long wait after you order your food. Make sure you have plenty of time if you plan on coming here!"}
{"text":"What an experience. Breakfast at Yoli's feels like you have been dropped in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. The neighboring restaurant(same patio separated by a fence) features a garden, home to dozens of exotic birds). Being serenaded by real life birds while I have breakfast isn't a bad deal if you ask me.  The food! I went with the mornin Monte, which turned out only to be the BEST breakfast sandwich I have ever had!! Turkey, havarty, bacon and egg whites nestled between French toast, layers upon layers of deliciousness. That would have been the perfect sandwich in itself. But then mama Yoli had to go and add the marmalade. Now that's just not fair. The marmalade takes this sandwich to stratospheric goodness!    Side note: what a sweet lady Ms Yoli is; Makes the restaurant feel more like a home kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment and just a gem that you wouldn't ever know was here! It's hidden but so worth finding"}
{"text":"It's off the beaten path. It's quiet. It's relaxing - plus there's a brewery next door and downtown is literally down the street.   Now, are you ready for some of the best breakfast you've ever had?   Volcano style biscuits and gravy with a side of hash browns, mix it all together.   You're welcome.   Don't bring a big group, i'd say more than 4 would be a bit too hectic."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, went with party of 6, all our first time there, and everyone was satisfied with their food. Only complaint is the inside area is a little cramped. But otherwise fantastic food and service"}
{"text":"FAA-BUUUU-LUHS!  Seriously fabulous!  We stopped in after reading the great reviews on Yelp and are so glad that we did.  A warm greeting upon entry, friendly and attentive service throughout our visit, awesome awesome awesome food and a yelp check-in discount to top it all off.  What more could we ask for?  Absolutely nothing!  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday morning brunch.  The food was very good, but the service was below average and the wait was long.    We shared a cheese biscuit, which was good and I ordered the Breakfast Monte which was also good.  I was going to order a smoothie, but when I asked, the waitress told me that the smoothies were made from a mix, instead of fresh made, so I ordered orange juice instead.  I don't have any complaints about the food.  The wait staff was friendly, but they seem very disorganized.  This place would really benefit from better management and better trained wait staff.  The staff should have assigned stations with specific tables they are responsible for.  When we were seated, it seemed that there was confusion over who was going to be our server.  Once we were seated, there was a long wait for the server to take our drink order, then a long wait for the server to take our food order, then an even longer wait for our food.  We rarely saw our server.  Other people we chatted with afterward, seemed to have the same experience.  Overall, I would say the food is good, but not worth the extremely slow and disorganized service.  If they can improve the service, this would be a four or five star place."}
{"text":"So I think I was expecting a lot more since it was 4 stars with 200+ reviews.    First, don't forget to check into mobile Yelp, they will give you 10% off of your bill!  The service was excellent, they were super friendly and seemed to love where they worked.    The atmosphere was nothing amazing.  If it had not been cold, we might have sat outside, but then we would have had to deal with the squawking birds from the Perch (not a good place to go, see my review of that place).   The food was good but not great.  They do have a nice wide variety of breakfast options.  They have something I always want but never see, a pick your own combo plate!  I was so excited because they had \"Hawaiian French Toast,\" but I did not want to order an entire order.  On the combo you can choose 1 slice.  I also went with scrambled eggs, hash browns (extra crispy), and ham.  For 2 eggs, the serving seemed a little light.  The hash browns, despite being extra crispy, were a little greasy, and the ham steak was good but way too thin.    Will I come back?  Probably will, since there are not a ton of breakfast spots near my parents home when I come to visit.   Next time I may enjoy it more since I don't have the over hyped 4 stars in my mind."}
{"text":"I went here with my children and my sister's family a couple of mornings ago. It's a hidden little place right behind The Perch Brewery. Service was very welcoming and attentive the entire time, and had a lot of patience and warmth towards the 5 young children in our group. The food was also delicious. I had the biscuits and gravy which was awesome. My son devoured his french toast and then started to steal my food after and wondered if he could also order what I had in addition to his food, lol. Everyone agreed their breakfast was very good. The morning was beautiful, and we loved the atmosphere sitting outside. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yuck.  I thought I had found a delectable dive in the midst of metropolis. Nope. I ordered the something \"Monte\" they said was their most favored breakfast. I couldn't eat it--tasted like old grease.  It wasn't just me. My friend had an omelet. Meh.  For those of you seeking a new, off the beaten path \"find\" for breakfast, this is not the place."}
{"text":"My wife and I was here for a wedding anniversary breakfast. We had never been here before and wanted to try someplace different. This is a sweet little hidden gem. It's located in downtown Chandler. The atmosphere is really nice with an \"L\" shaped patio and a small inside eating area. We sat out side since it was nice out. Breakfast was great! The food came out within ten minutes of ordering and our service was very good. The food: Hearty skillet was fantastic! It came out steaming hot and had tons of flavor coming from the bacon, sausage, and ham mixed with eggs and biscuits and gravy (a rare treat for me). My wife had an omelet that she enjoyed. The restaurant next door that I have not tried yet has a bunch of rescue parrots and exotic birds that are making noise and singing which just adds to making it a good breakfast. Will go back again."}
{"text":"What is not to love about this lovely hidden gem.    Its shares a courtyard with the Perch Brewery (which is another hidden gem in itself).  I've been here a few times for breakfast and each time it's outstanding.  Very local feel where you can tell they care about their food and service.  It's nothing fancy just well executed.    It's a small place but even if you have to wait for a table you can just walk about the courtyard and enjoy the Birds on display from The Perch.   I recommend this place to any and everyone. It's off the Main Street and parking can get tricky if you go during peak hours, but it's worth the effort."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast portions.  The Hawaiian french toast and hashbrowns are amazing. Service was great.  Food flavor was perfect.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this spot for a while. I love trying new brunch spots and had found them searching the area on Yelp.  My husband and I shared the Ultimate bagel egg sandwhich ( with egg, cheese and turkey) and the french toast with banana. We both thought it was just ok. Nothing special. So I'm a bit surprised how highly they've been rated. Maybe it was just whatever we ate but I'm not interested in coming back. I gave 3 stars because it is in a cute location (it's kinda confusing to find but it's right next to the Perch) and the service was good."}
{"text":"I really have mixed feelings about this place; food vs. service. We decided to try Yoli's for breakfast yesterday. When we arrived we walked through the courtyard and there wasn't an obvious sign that's shows you how to get seated or if you seat yourself. Several servers just kept walking by even though I'm pretty sure we both had confused looks on our faces. Once we got inside we were not really greeted. The woman running the counter just kept glancing at us while we stood there and servers kept rushing around us. It made us feel uncomfortable and in the way. Finally we were told someone would be with us shortly. While we waited something hard smashed onto the floor causing me to jump, one server loudly was yelling that It wasn't her fault, while the lady behind the counter was arguing, in a sarcastic tone, that it was. The woman behind the counter loudly exclaimed that three coffees were ready, the server argued she only needed one. They decided to yell back and forth about who was wrong. There was absolutely zero professionalism. Seriously, and if that was the owner acting in that manner then you can never expect the rest of the staff to behave either. We had only been there a few minutes and our experience was already stressing me out. I'll never understand people that truly have no tact or show courtesy, especially In front of the business's customers.  Finally we were seated and gave our drink order. After our drinks were brought we gave our food order; we went for the hearty skillet, and the Hawaiian french toast. The wait time on our food was actually pretty quick, maybe 10 minutes. When the food arrived everything looked great, we dug in. We're trying this new thing where we pick a couple items from a menu and share, so we both got to try everything. We both felt the skillet was very tasty and was seasoned well. We also agreed on the Hawaiian french toast that while it was good, there was nothing special about it. It tasted no different than decently made french toast made with a thick texas toast bread. We were expecting pineapple to come with it but that's extra. They really should automatically add pineapple if they're going to call it Hawaiian. That's like calling regular french toast \"Texas French Toast\" when using the regular texas toast.  Our main issue with Yoli's, as others have stated, is the lack of professionalism with the staff. We heard our own server walk past our table several times cursing and exasperating her breath dramatically. It was a turn off because we felt like we were a nuisance to the staff, as well as some staff members liking to show customers how exhausted they are. Also we sat near a cart where the servers were throwing all the dirty dishes, and a pile of trash started accumulating on the floor that no one bothered to pick up; straw sleeves, empty and dripping creamer cups, napkins, foil, etc... No one cared that the guests could see how messy they were.  Overall while the food was good, the service was terrible. Would we go back? Possibly, when it cools off so we can sit outside away from the craziness that goes on inside."}
{"text":"Love, love love this place! Amazing breakfasts and fast and friendly service.  Everyone who works there is just lovely and they allow dogs on their patio and treat my scared mutt like a princess. I recommend this place to everyone and anyone."}
{"text":"Love this place, staff is always friendly, like you know them. Breakfast is hearty and love the little seating area. Hope they continue this great business"}
{"text":"We were headed to Chandler's mall and thus, decided to try a place for breakfast that we'd never heard of, since we're in the area about 3 times a year. A Yelp search brought up Yoli's Cafe with it's 4 start average out of 101 reviews. Looked unique, kitschy and in the general area of where we were going. Done!  There was a short wait and a bit of miscommunication when we were sat and waited semi-long for coffee. However, I have a soft spot for people in the service industry working breakfast. It's such a bumbling rush for a few short hours and lots of people are angry jerks who pound gallons of coffee. (How is it possible for some people to CHUG boiling hot coffee?)   Once that was all rectified we ordered our breakfast and seriously waited about 4 minutes before it arrived. AWESOME. I got a breakfast sandwich on an Everything bagel (warm, chewy and toasty. Delicious.) with egg whites, mushrooms, spinach and subbed cheddar/jack for the Havarti. It was one of the most perfect breakfast sammies I've ever had--and I'm a connoisseur. Boyfriend ordered the veggie omelet which was STUFFED! with veggies and came with really tasty hash browns and some toast. They brought out sides of homemade hot sauce and verde sauce on his requst. The verde was cilantro magic. I wish I could buy a gallon.  To-go coffee was offered by our sweet server and all said, breakfast was $18. Come on! Oh how I wish Yoli's was closer to home."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here a couple of months ago and I was slightly disappointed. They mixed up our orders with another table which happens I understand. The food was pretty good, but it wasn't incredibly memorable. I think we should give it another shot sometime though and try a few different things. The bird cages next to the restaurant were pretty cool."}
{"text":"this is one of my top 10 places to eat breakfast/brunch in the chandler-gilbert area. it's kind of tricky to find being nestled between city hall and some back private residential streets. the food and staff there are great, all the typical breakfast food can be found there. they have a $10 deal where you can get 2 eggs made to your like and 3 other items to go with it such as toast, pancakes and french toast just to name a few. definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"I went here with 3 other family members for my birthday. We arrived at a peak time, on a Sunday around 10 am so I expected a wait. We waited over an hour to be seated but then had to wait another hour for our food so we were finally eating (lunch at this point) over two hours after we arrived. The outdoor ambiance was wonderful. There was foliage and a beautiful outdoor eating area on a wooden platform, which we didn't get to enjoy during breakfast because we learned that area isn't actually owned my Yoli's. So instead we were seated inside and if the air conditioning was on I couldn't tell. We were so hot we were sweating. And we weren't even brought water until we had been sitting there sweating for 45 minutes.   The food was the biggest disappointment. Everyone ordered something different so we could get a good overall impression. We ordered the \"Hawaiian\" French toast, supposedly a house specialty. It tasted like regular French toast, and not even great French toast at that. Supposedly it has pineapple but none of us could taste anything. The sausage gravy that came with the biscuits was disgusting. It had the consistency and taste of frozen generic gravy so I highly doubt it was homemade, as the restaurant claims. The sausage links also appeared to be reheated from a frozen package. My egg and bacon biscuit sandwich came with one strip of thin, cheap bacon that only covered half my sandwich. The cheddar biscuits were nothing special and there was no option of a plain biscuit. Unfortunately the whole menu was also pretty limited. By the time we ate at noon they apparently had run out of a lot of things.   Overall the food quality was poor, the wait was ridiculous, even for peak hours (they could have at least brought us water), and the restaurant was too cramped and uncomfortable. I do not recommend this place, especially if you have children because the wait is too long and the menu is too specialized for picky eaters."}
{"text":"First time here.  It's right next to The Perch.  I had the steak and peppers skillet.  It was a great change from the normal eggs and bacon type breakfast.  My wife had the French toast w bananas and she loved it as well.  It's a tiny place with great breakfast food.  My only knock is that they don't have dairy creamer for coffee but they do have non dairy options.  Our waitress was fantastic and gave us suggestions on the menu as well as kept our drinks filled and needs accommodated."}
{"text":"There isn't any dish I don't like here. I have zero shame to eat here on a daily of need be. Customer service is always pleasant. Eating here gives such a homey feel. Love the courtyard area especially when the weather is just right. You won't be disappointed with this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to enjoy a great breakfast with a wonderful owner and delicious food.. from Tx and i try and make it here every time I visit Az. I would highly recommend Yoli's Cafe"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town and everyone is so friendly.   Love the atmosphere.  Biscuits and heavy for the table is a must!!  Yummmm"}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever. Skillets are generously portioned and home fries are amazing. Yummy raisin toast....love the vibe...did I mention best pancakes ever?"}
{"text":"This just looks like you're walking into someone's house to eat. It seemed kinda sketchy and we almost left, but decided to go in since the reviews were pretty good. Legit the best breakfast I've ever had. I got the Hearty skillet breakfast and it was amazing, I wanted to go back the next day. The only downside is it's small, so it gets warm really quickly. I was so impressed with the food, I wouldn't even take a star off for how hot it got. Staff was nice, reasonably priced, and the food was the best. It got busy with lots of people who seemed like regulars. They have some raving fans--me included."}
{"text":"I'm beyond impressed with the quality of food that Yoli's Cafe has to offer. My girlfriend and I were immediately greeted by all of the staff when we walked into the restaurant and we were able to pick our own seat. After looking through the lunch menu I chose the Monte Crisco and my girlfriend chose the Carne Asada Tacos. The Monte Crisco was perfect! The french toast bread was fresh and there was plenty of ham stacked on the sandwich. Without asking, I was given both regular syrup and there homemade Chipotle Marmalade on the side. The Marmalade was amazing and I will definitely tell them to put it directly on the sandwich next time. My girlfriend LOVED the Carne Asada Tacos. The ingredients were very fresh and they didn't hold back on the amount of meat in the tacos. On the side she got Mexican Cold Slaw and this amazing side of re-fried beans that had a hint of beef and cheese. After we finished our meal, one of the owners came out, sat down next to our table and asked us how we liked everything. He told us a little bit of the history behind the restaurant and the area that surrounded it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is tired of the franchise restaurants and who enjoys family/mom and pop joints."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go because of all the great reviews. Parking is convenient. The food was just okay. Honestly didn't think it was anything special. The service was just okay. We went on a Friday morning and we were served by an older woman. She didn't look at me at all the entire time we were there. Every time she came up to the table she spoke to my boyfriend. At first I didn't think anything of it until I went to pay and she still just wouldn't look at me. It was incredibly weird. I also saw her coughing on a bunch of cups for a to go order. Not a place we will be revisiting."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. Their food is always hot and fresh and the bagels are always soft and melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"First time here with my family. It was tricky to get there with all the streets in the area half closed because of the Ostrich Festival. Nice local breakfast spot with friendly staff and nice patio.  The food was very good and came out fast. Strongly recomended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  Love everything about yolis!"}
{"text":"Great food, the owner is also a cook, great atmosphere,very tranquil, lots of birds if you eat outside in the trees. Waitresses are pleasant with good positive attitudes. Come here for breakfast every Sun I come from Calif."}
{"text":"This place is good. I always get the egg salad sandwich and am never disappointed. It's a cute little restaurant tucked back in a little shopping type plaza. I recommend this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews & I was excited to try the food. I was rather underwhelmed by my food; we had brunch and I ordered the chorizo skillet. It was just okay, nothing great or very bad about it. I had a meh experience, wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. The staff was extremely rude. I was excited to try this place and ended up leaving. There were four of us waiting for a table outside. We waited 30 minutes(and there were several empty tables outside!) and the rude guy told to us take the table inside. We reminded him we asked for outside. He walked away angry. Then another staff member asked for his help and he was slamming condiments on the table. Then another lady told us to go take the table inside!! We told her we want outside and she shook her head and said it doesn't say outside. We left! I can see having an off day but I have read several other reviews of bad service. This wasn't just bad service. It was disgustingly rude."}
{"text":"Yoli's Cafe was such a delight - and cute as a button. We walked in and were greeted by a very polite waitress. Our drinks were brought immediately, and lunch followed shortly thereafter.  What a quaint restaurant tucked off the beaten path in downtown Chandler.  I can't say enough about the quality of the food. The applesauce was the freshest, the egg salad sandwich the tastiest, and the fries (my wife let me sneak a few of hers) were the most fresh-cut.  Absolutely recommend and plan to be back - I'll never get enough of that egg salad"}
{"text":"The food was yummy but the place was kind of dirty. The floor wasn't broomed so there were pieces of food all over. For that I give 4 stars. Nothing wrong with the food though."}
{"text":"My parents just drove from laveen to eat here, we have 8 ppl and they can't seat us, we even said we can jus split....nobody even knew what to do....they were being rude about it....so we jus decided to the brewery next door...definitely let us down"}
{"text":"Great food great service and very quaint. Nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The food was good and staff were friendly but it seemed like they were only 2 waitress which took a while to get our bill and etc.. But otherwise this place  is a good place for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Charming little property. Of the weather is nice it's an awesome outdoor eatery.  Service is great, and prices are good. Food is good quality and testy. Nothing blew me away, but everything was good.  I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"Oh Lord this spot is the new breakfast spot for us. No the place is not huge but the menu will knock your socks off with quality food .   My coworker and his wife have dine a great job with this place downtown Chandler ..must try and the prices are extremely reasonable ..get here"}
{"text":"A favorite place for the husband and I to go on the weekends! I ALWAYS get the Morning Monte- always a great choice:-) you cannot beat the food, the service or the prices!"}
{"text":"Great Service and even better food! Always feel so welcomed when I come in! I had the egg white veggie omelet and added ham. Absolutely delicious! I will always come back when in town"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a hole in the wall place that we'd never tried when we found Yolis. We absolutely loved their breakfast burritos and service was wonderful! Definitely want to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Five stars. All around. The food, the staff, the prices, the environment. You won't get this kind of experience or service anywhere else. I love coming here for breakfast/brunch when I'm in the area.   Overall, one of the BEST hidden gems in the valley."}
{"text":"This is a small quaint little breakfast shop off the beaten path. Really good food, a tad more expensive than comparable locations, but the food is of better quality. Nice semi shady outdoor seating which is right next the the Perch bar next door, so plenty of birds talking making for a relaxing experience."}
{"text":"Such a good find! This place opened up 5 years ago in the old Better Than Sex Cafe. They have an outside patio area and indoor seating.   I had the 2 egg combo and hubby had the chorizo and egg skillet. Service is quick and friendly. Will definitely come back with the family. It will be a go-to breakfast place for us!"}
{"text":"Visit - 5/26/201  Indeed...a potenential hidden gem!  Food was decent, but wait staff was very good.  I got the steak skillet, son#1 the Denver omelet, son #2 the hearty skillet.  I am not a food critic, but the steak skillet was a bit bland, but it looked really good.  The home-style potatoes were really good.  Only major complaint was the time it took to get our food, else, it would have been 4 stars.  I think this was due to the nice weather and there were a lot of people that morning."}
{"text":"Everything we have tried we have enjoyed. The Morning Monte is delicious, the marmalade really adds the extra zip. Hubby loves the cheddar biscuits with gravy. Service is always great, and we love that it is a local owned family restaurant. They treat our three year old like a princess, and she loves the birds in the courtyard."}
{"text":"My hubby and I walk to downtown Chandler every Sunday for brunch. Tried Yoli's a couple weeks ago and again this Sunday.   Both times service was excellent and the food delicious. French toast... mmmm yeah!  Biscuits and gravy is so good too!"}
{"text":"Family operated and they are super friendly. Parking is a bear. About 20 tables with 1/2 outdoor. LARGE portions!"}
{"text":"The pictures are true... the wait is well worth it.. the place is so cute..  So we didn't stay here for breakfast but we called in and got our meal for pick up. And wow... I actually said OMG after my first bite of the Monty Sandwhich. It was magical, mouthwatering.. all the hype has said about it. If you havent reaad it in other reviews.. it is like a grownup poshe mcgriddle. Yes.. i know it sounds gross but no. Its wait the mcgriddle wanted to be and basically fell off the wagon, lost its way.. and forgot about its main goal and the powdered sugar.  I definitely need to dine in next time.. but just with that I didnt need to try ore.. even though as always we ordered way more food than we needed.  We also got the hawaiin pancakes. WOW."}
{"text":"Fun cafe. Unassuming from the outside, but delicious food. Corned beef hash was fabulous. We came as a group and all tried different things we liked"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Super friendly owners & staff. The Biscuits & Gravy was the best, wish I could take back to California. Also tried the French Toast out of this World! Will came back when I visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"A great place in Chandler.   Hidden gem, friendly service, good food! I recommend the egg combo and the coffee...it's strong and keeps on coming!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in the east valley, not just chandler. Friendly staff amazing food."}
{"text":"Great little unassuming place in what looks like a courtyard of a home.    Food was excellent, service very friendly"}
{"text":"I found this place when looking for an early Sunday breakfast.  The cafe is somewhat located on a quiet residential street.  I nearly passed it in fact.  It is attached to several other businesses by a courtyard with limited outside seating.  The food is what you would expect, OK.  Would I go back, sure but it may not be a primary destination.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Love it here. The mornin monte is delicious! It's a cute little hidden gem in Chandler."}
{"text":"I've had a number of meals here and never been disappointed. It's definitely one of our go to places.  They do a nice breakfast burrito and a great burger. Fries are also quite nice.  While we often do take out (with it being right next to Gangplank), I also like the ambiance of the cafe. It's got kind of a cool, old style feel.  Staff is super nice as well."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place out for awhile, and I'm so glad I finally did! Service and food was great. My husband and I sat outside and it was nice to be able to hear the birds from the Perch.   The restaurant is located right next to the Perch restaurant. It took us awhile to locate it, but so worth it."}
{"text":"1hr wait for our food after we got a seat.  Nice scenery and awesome vibe. That's were it ends.  The Blueberry muffins was unbeatable and dry.  The biscuits and gravy was pretty dang good. Should come with sausage or bacon though.  The Carne asada burrito was pretty bland.  The sandwich made out of French toast was the best thing and it was decent at best.  We will be back to the Perch but not here."}
{"text":"Amazing food its location seems a bit daunting but totally worth it once you go inside.  It is located right next to Perth Micro Brewery and they share a beautiful tropical patio, with plenty of sprayers and shade to keep the cancer away.  We met a group of friends and ate almost everything offered on the menu, nothing was bad, they had a large enough variety for every taste and fussiness.  We had younger children with us but no problem finding them something to eat.  Portions were all plenty and then staff attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Super good! Had the the something Monte which is eighties, grilled turkey, bacon havarti cheese In a French toast sandwich. It came with some chili infused marmalade. Ice coffee was tasty."}
{"text":"We used to come here when it was BTS, so decided to visit again. Wasn't sure it was open with all the construction around & the empty parking lot, but they were open -- fortunately for us. We were served right away & we all ordered the pastrami melt for old times' sake, which did not disappoint! We'll be back for sure.  Note: If you check in on Yelp, you get a 10% disc. Same if you're retired military."}
{"text":"This place makes me wish this wasn't just a vacation stop. I ordered the Morning Monte--absolutely delicious. I also had a giant iced coffee and fresh fruit that were equally amazing. Staff is friendly and the back patio seating is wonderful and calming. So happy I found this little oasis!"}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent service! We came around 11:30 on a Saturday morning and it was perfect! The food, especially the French toast, was delicious, the portion sizes were just right, and the service was timely and attentive. We got our food about 5 minutes after ordering it and the ambiance was very relaxing. Just a perfect morning breakfast! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I did not want to get all hyped up over the reviews about this place. All too often they will paint a picture in my head which just cannot live up to reality. This is something I am working on. I quickly perused the star ratings, and hurried out the door, excited for breakfast. My friend and I were politely greeted & seated. I saw the first item on the menu.. the \"Mornin Monte\" .. sold! I ordered it with my coffee, forcing my company to let go of his indecisiveness. He regretfully blurted out, \"Errrr.. Ughh.. Combo: eggs, hashbrowns, french toast, fruit bowl\" What a pussy! So that was it.. Seated, orders in, coffee cooling.. all within 3 minutes after parking.   So we sat. We listened to a group of elderly women discussing their kidney problems, admired the hickey just below our waitress' right ear. We smiled at a baby going crazy on a bowl of fruit with strawberries in it, and cringed over the girls next to us complaining about their struggles at the office. Actually, it was one girl griping, and the other sporadically inserting \"yeah\" here and there. (I thought: bitch, its Saturday.. chill out!)   We sat some more. Patiently. For about 45 minutes! The Golden Girls had gone.. leaving us with the 2 unhappy hipster chicks..   Finally! Our food!! The wait was ridiculous, so in order to get me back in there.. this Monte had to hit the spot. It didn't. Not even close. It's a french toast sandwich with egg white, turkey breast, turkey bacon, havarti, and some spicy marmalade. Honestly, minus the marmalade.. this thing was bland as fuck. The french toast egg mixture could use sprucing up. Maybe throw some fresh herbs into the egg white too? I dunno. It wasn't impressive in my opinion at all. Daniel's eggs and hashbrowns were eggs and hashbrowns. He agreed the french toast was wack... and those strawberries the little girl was macking on.. the ones that made him say, \"Fruit Bowl!\".. ya, those were nowhere to be found. In fact, there were only grapes in there. Weird right?   Service was great. The big guy who took my money at the end was very cool. I just don't like waiting 45-50 minutes for ho hum food.. Sorry Yoli's, you were a disappointment."}
{"text":"I loved this place. First time, we dropped by based on the great reviews. Fabulous place for breakfast. Delicious food. Great environment."}
{"text":"Excellent waitstaff, delicious food, and good prices! And there are rescue birds (mostly tropical) in the courtyard. A little loud inside, but definitely a place I will visit again!"}
{"text":"This is more than a great place to eat.  It is like going over to a friends house and having them take care of you. Stop reading reviews and just go!    Yolis has been our favorite breakfast and lunch place for years. The food is excellent and the owner Yoli and Rick along with their staff are wonderful.  They spend the time to cultivate relationships with their customers and always make you feel like your part of the family.    Then there are the pancakes....they are perfection. There is a secrete menu...ask about the volcano..."}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:30 am on a Sunday morning .  We were surprised at the location but it works as a local non - chain restaurant.   Our wait was about 15 min and our drink orders were taken promptly.  Wit in 5 min our orders were taken and delivered in another 20 min.  The food was hot and tasty.  All three in our party were satisfied and stated they would come back.  A nice local restaurant."}
{"text":"Seemed a little chaotic as they pack a lot of eaters in a small place. Some small issues were present like a forgotten water and running out of flavored creamer. Cozy place however although I'd try to snag a chair if I were you and not a stool.  Service - As I mentioned, server was a bit busy and running around like crazy. Apparently there was a coupon that folks were taking advantage of and they didn't expect such a rush. Even when running around though, she did her best to make sure we were ok.   Food - I ordered the green eggs and ham omelette plus I added tomatoes and it comes with a side of potatoes plus grain. Wife ordered a belgian waffle with blueberries and strawberries. Both of us ordered coffee; it was fresh and had a nice smoky taste. Food took about 30 minutes. Food was pretty standard for a place like this. I would highly reccomend getting the green eggs and ham omelette with pepper jack (you can add tomatoes as well). Food felt like it had been in the pass for a while. Overall though, the flavors were good.   Price - We got all listed above for 17.60 plus tip. I'd say that I'd quite a good deal for the large portions.   I'd give Yoli's 4 stars based on friendly service, good coffee, feel and price. Food is as good as any other little mom and pop diner. Nothing stood out, but nothing dissapointed. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I stumbled on to this little cafe in a hidden little marketplace tucked back off of AZ Ave. in downtown Chandler. The Cafe had a good size patio that looked over the market's square which has big olive trees, fountains and a couple of big bird cages. it is also accompanied by several shops. I had breakfast there on my first visit, YUM! didn't expect anything more than your standard breakfast. My eggs were cooked perfectly, thick crisp bacon, perfectly cooked hash browns oh and the piece de resistance was the French Toast! that came with my breakfast. I never thought anything could beat my mothers french toast, until now. they used some Hawaiian bread and it has had me craving french toast for dinner and lunch ever since! The owner/chef came out to say hi and make sure everything was to our liking, she was so friendly (as well was the waitress) and made us feel like a usual customer or friend. I will make this a weekly stop for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. I had an egg white Carne asade burrito and my husband had the 2 eggs any style with French toast, ham and toast! He got to choose his sides which made him very happy.  :-)"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was very delicious. It is not that attractive from the outside. the portion servings were more than enough. The waitress took her time explaining the menu as i had a few questions. i'm glad i tried it and it was work it. prices were excellent for all the food you get"}
{"text":"If you don't know, now ya know! Yoli's Cafe is THE SPOT! It's a mom and pop place that comes with a 1,2 punch. My girlfriend and I went for the first time and got the volcano biscuits & gravy, along with the morning monte. Sharing both so we could get variety and within the first bites we soon realized we were putting the tastiest food on the planet in our mouths. What was supposed to be a pleasant brunch. Turned out to be a who could eat the most, the fastest. I guess that's what happens when you are eating food as good as what Yoli is serving.   Go if ya haven't. Hell, go if ya have. If you're already there, plan you're next trip."}
{"text":"The French toast is a must. Hearty skillet a good choice, too. Can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Yooooooooolis! We love this place. There hasn't been one single thing on the menu that hasn't been good. Chorizo burrito and the volcano style biscuits were super delicious. The owners are super friendly and are always coming around saying hi and checking on things."}
{"text":"Mornin monte was amazing! Service was excellent. Our family will be coming back regularly!"}
{"text":"First time to this place. Made a proactive effort with the manager/owner to learn all about this place. More than 60 minutes after placing our order and no initiative by our server to assure us our meal was coming we asked for an update. The manager/owner came to the table to say, don't worry you will like it. Really? No \"sorry for the delay or hey, coffee is on us\". A minute later the meal arrived. Good food for sure. No complaints there. As we walked out, another server (not ours) offered an awkward \"sorry\". All starts with the owner/manager. Unfortunately we won't be back"}
{"text":"Seemingly fun location next to The Perch with the birds and what not. We thought the patio would be nice because it was beautiful out... The food was good and came out hot. I just couldn't concentrate on eating because we were getting attacked by flies and dealing with wasp and bee fly-overs the whole time. I would say they have a problem. The food took a long time too. Find something else for breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"I must confess that I'm not much of a breakfast person.  I haven't sat down to a real breakfast in approximately eleven years.  I have never been one to just roll out of bed and go, \"Pancakes sound amazebeans!\"  Had I been served some Yoli's Hawaiian french toast in my younger years, that might have changed my mindset in my adulthood.  Time-jump to yesterday, Friday at 11:30am.  Finding this place was slightly tricky and locating a parking spot was even trickier!  Nonetheless, we all arrived on time and sat down to be served by the most amusing and friendly waitress ever.  She's so friendly, outgoing, and personable.  I wanted to put her in my pocket!  This lady's a hoot!  I ordered a Mornin' Monte after being told the difference between that and the Monte Cristo [one has egg whites in place of ham].  Best decision ever.    There was turkey, crispy bacon, egg whites, and Havarti cheese sandwiched in between the most perfectly grilled Hawaiian french toast with spicy orange marmalade and syrup on the side.  Although it's french toast, I opted not drowning my french toast with the syrup.  It would be much too sweet and strong on top of all that powdered sugar goodness.  Instead, I had spread a modest layer of spicy orange marmalade onto every bite.  It was bliss.  The lovely Ms. Yoli saw me sharing with my lunch companions and gave me an extra marmalade.  Totally sweet of her!  I ended up taking half my sandwich home which I tucked away a few hours later straight out of the fridge.  Still delicious, still amazing.  So now I sit here daydreaming of a delicious Mornin' Monte for breakfast and wishing I could eat it every day.  Of course, I'd probably end up packing on the pounds but hey, who needs vanity when you can have Monte?  *** Featured in The Weekly Yelp, December 17, 2014 - The Breakfast Club"}
{"text":"Second visit to Yoli's and thoroughly enjoyed both times.  In Phoenix to visit my daughter and she recommends Yoli's  highly and I agree.  Don't judge from the outward appearance. Once inside, it has a nice casual ambiance and, weather permitting, a nice outdoor patio for dining, complete with overhead misters.  Now to the food.  Everything at Yoli's is great.  Last visit, I had the steak skillet and a side of pancakes.  One word, fantastic.  King sized pancakes and probably the best I've ever had.  Though they were light and fluffy, the. Two of us could only finish half of them.  Oh we'll, makes great leftovers.  Had to save room for the steak skillet.  Bite sized pieces of sirloin are seasoned and sautéed with onions and peppers and served with two eggs on top, cooked to order and your choice of potatoes.  Freshly made salsa is also available.  Everything is cooked with great care by someone (Yoli) who really enjoys cooking and sharing her love of good food with others.  In closing, give Yoli's a try for breakfast or lunch and enjoy sharing this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I tried out Yoli's this past weekend for the first time. We arrived around 10AM on Saturday and were able to sit down right away. We reviewed the menu and asked the waitress for suggestions. The waitress said we must try the french toast as it is the most popular item. I'm a fan of a good old American breakfast which is eggs, bacon, country potato's (with onions, peppers, and jalapenos), and pancakes which is what I ordered. My wife ordered the same however she ordered french toast instead of pancakes. Once we ordered it took around 45 min to get our food which was odd because there were only 8 patrons and 4 already had their food. The eggs, bacon and potato's came first and it was not a good first impression. The 2 pieces of bacon were ~3 inch long and the eggs did not look very appealing. The country potato's did look good and they tasted very good also. The highlight of our breakfast was the pancake and french toast, they were good enough to almost forget about how long the wait was and how unimpressed we were with everything else. If I go again I will get the pancakes only."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Chandler. It is a hidden gem but totally worth it. The staff is friendly, service is quick and food is delicious. I recommend the chorizo skillet!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some breakfast on Saturday morning. The location looked to be maybe a old house turned restaurant. It looked really cool, also next door was the perch which has all kinds of birds and you can hear them from the patio seating at Yolis. We were kind of confused when we walked up because first we couldn't find the front door, but then we didn't know if we sat ourselves or if someone sat us. We found our way in and the staff was very helpful with seating us after we asked them. It was around 9 am and it wasn't very busy. We sat outside and the atmosphere is very chill, we loved hearing the birds squawk next-door. The waitress was super fast with drinks and food. The restaurant was very accommodating to my low carb requests. The food was delivered super fast and it was delicious. Def nice little place to get some breakfast in, nothing special about it. Just well cooked breakfast foods."}
{"text":"The old saying, \"don't judge a book by its cover\" more than applies to Yoli's Cafe.  We actually considered passing it up because the surroundings are less than appealing.  We went around a side street taking us to the entrance rather than the back by the spray painted buildings with bars on the windows.  It's actually very cute and inviting when you go around front.  There was a woman with a parrot on her shoulder talking to people sitting around in the shade.  I was intrigued but much too hungry to stop.  Anywho, it's a very small little spot and we sat out on the cute little patio.  Our server was very friendly and helpful !  Both my boyfriend and I got different skillets which I forgot the names of (sorry).  But they were both delicious !  I would definitely recommend this little spot to others if you're looking for a yummy breakfast/brunch ! :)"}
{"text":"We arrived separately after taking incorrect turns in downtown Chandler, ordered on three different checks, complained about how customer service in this country is lacking on so many levels and then we had breakfast at Yoli's! Get thee-self over here straight-away. They have been serving up delicious breakfasts for 18 months now and this is the first I've heard of them. I need to get out more often. Pancakes, waffles, eggs, breakfast sammies, omelettes, skillets, biscuits ... need I go on? Friendly and personable service with smiles and helpful can-do attitudes.Good food served to order hot and yummy. Inside seating, garden seating, your choice, your way. I love a place that goes above and beyond to make my day a special one. Thank you Yoli's for reminding me that there is goodness and deliciousness all rolled into one place right here in Chandler, Arizona."}
{"text":"Mom and Pop place a little off the beaten path in downtown Chandler. That really sums it up. The restaurant is located in an old house so you really do feel like you are sitting at someone's kitchen table having coffee. We went in for a late breakfast on Saturday am. I had a Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and the hubby had the steak skillet. Food was A-ok. Good coffee and a nice place to just take your time and read the paper since they were not busy at all. The server was a little awkward but his mom explained that it was his first day working the front of the house. Remember what I said about Mom and Pop? I can't say this was the best meal I've had but it was pretty good and we will definitely be back simply because all the other breakfast places we like just have such a long wait on the weekends.   Also was an interesting visit since I never knew this shopping plaza existed even though we come to the main part of downtown Chandler regularly. Two of the shops were out of business so I guess I am not alone. I am going to write some reviews of the stores that are still open so stay tuned for that.... ;0)"}
{"text":"Not sure what else to say except that this place is amazing! I get the chorizo scramble which is always delicious! Friendly staff and nice quaint little breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"A few things... - This place is located in one of the older, and more colorful, parts of Chandler - When you find the place you'll wonder if its the right place - Parking can be a challenge  Ordered biscuits and gravy.  Not bad...little light on sausage but pretty good overall.  The biscuits were very good, but for some reason seemed to be somewhat toasted...odd.  Good place...will go again."}
{"text":"I went to Yoli's yesterday for the first time and boy what a bad experience, I actually walked out. We arrived at 11:35 am looking for lunch. Guess what, they argued about giving us a lunch menu because it wasn't noon yet and then when they finally gave it to us they said they wouldn't take our lunch order until it was actually noon! What?!? When I spoke to the hostess she wasn't any help so we left. I'll not go back to a place that looked like it might be a keeper. I was shocked to get this kind of reception from a locally owned place..."}
{"text":"I can't understand why people rave about this place. It's kind of a dump, for one thing. Secondly, the food is just ok. It's typical greasy breakfast food that I'd expect to get at Denny's. The only thing that stood out was the hawaiian french toast--that was pretty good. Loads of mexican style breakfast food, if you like that and maybe that's better. I just had your standard fare since I'm not a \"breakfast burrito\" kinda gal. Nice that they did a Yelp discount and the staff was friendly enough but, overall, I was not impressed by anything about this place and would not likely return."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! The staff was quick to greet us, take our drink and food order and offer refills. First time we were told they were short staffed and would be a wait. To help pass the time, the waitress came by often to chat, refill coffee, and bring us a free homemade muffin. She was very funny and kept us entertained. Second time, Yoli came by to see how we were doing and chatted for a few minutes.  I highly recommend the veggie skillet with chorizo added. Also love the Monte and the hearty skillet which should be renamed \"the kitchen sink of breakfast\" because it was everything you dreamed of and more. They even offer flavored coffee creamer, bonus.  Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"There are only about 6 tables inside, if you don't want to sit outside you might be waiting a while.  The outside patio is beautiful.  I got biscuits and gravy, I have definitely had better.  I wasn't impressed.  They did have chocolate caramel creamer for my coffee though, I was pretty excited about that.  I don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"Yoli's you redeemed yourselves!  I went back a second time with my husband and kids...approximately at the same time as before, and yes, you did good.  This time we ordered different things, and I have to say I liked the food from the first visit more.  The burger.  This time we got their Montecristo, which I hear is a favorite, but not my thing at all.  But thanks to the sugar on top, my kids loved it.   But the service was 100% improved.  We even had the same server as last time, which kind of worried me.  She was pleasant and quick.  It was a beautiful day, and the kids ran around while we waited for the food.  The birds were chirping...aaaaah, life is good.  Thanks Yoli."}
