{"text":"if you are MSG sensitive stay clear of this place. I haven't been here in 2 + years ever since my last experience.  like most reviews the pizza is so so...more along the lines of grocery store pizza....the music is wonderful. Like a previous poster said the ordering process and the lack of credit card acceptance (or lack thereof)is a huge drawback"}
{"text":"They do not except cash. They don't have waiters. They don't even give free refills on soda. I will. Ever come back here again. Entertainment was neat."}
{"text":"If you go for the pizza you're doing it wrong.  It's not very good.  1 or 2 star pizza at a five star place.  But sub par pizza is still pizza so it ain't all bad.  We got our food really quick and stayed for about an hour an half to watch some kind of mad genius play something that looked liked the cab on an old steam powered locomotive!  He controlled a little mechanical bird that chirped notes to certain songs from that thing!  The future has truly arrived!  Do you hear me?  The future!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a very unique atmosphere, with a live organist playing all kinds of crazy instruments hooked up to the stage organ and taking very limited requests. This is primarily a pizza place with similar sides, but nothing there is good except the beer. I personally had a bad pizza experience there and now refer to this place strictly as \"The Organ Stopper\". Bring kids up to ages 8 or 9, but beyond that they will probably get bored or annoyed fast, unless they are very musically-minded or have an organ-playing scholarship on the horizon. For adults, bring a DD and knock back a pitcher or two to make your time worth it."}
{"text":"Coolest and most entertaining pizza place I've ever been to! The whole place is like one big musical instrument. The organ player takes requests and can play anything you throw at him. The pizza isn't bad either and they also have a gluten free option."}
{"text":"I am thinking people are writing reviews for the atmosphere and not the food.  The food is not good.  You go for the adventure of it but not the food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good old vintage music, this is the place!  Not many organs like this left.  Pizza is average, but that's not the point.  Its all about the organ music!"}
{"text":"Simply put the organists are good...REALLY good.  Food isn't great but it's still good.  Wonderful family experience.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Dirty ice. Apperently roaches near drink station in kitchen"}
{"text":"Horrible. Loud and employees are lazy and chatting instead of working on our pizza which took forever to get. I don't recommend going here at all."}
{"text":"As everyone has said food is soso but the do have to pump it out fast to deal with the crowds. The show is cool mostly an older crowd it was for my grandmothers birthday. It's funny to watch people try to talk over the music looks like everyone is going in for a awkward kiss. Overall it's a ok place with the fam"}
{"text":"OMG    This place is a shit show. 16,00 grandmas and grandpas with grandkids in tow sitting middle school cafeteria style to eat pizza and watch a 3 story organ being played by a man in a black suit.   First act is for the kids. He starts with Disney classics and ends with a spirit lifting collection of American tunes. All the elders stand and applaud while the American flag is lowered and bubbles float from the rafters.   Intermission: Old lady in front of me falls off her bench and almost puts her head through the drywall. Old lady adjacent me spills her drink on my feet. 6 year old children run around yielding iPhones and iPod touches, taking videos to upload to their baby Facebook accounts.   In the second act shit gets real. Star Wars, the Beatles, and Freddy Mercury. By this time the 30-something's have finished a couple pitchers of beer and are screaming the words to Bohemian Rhapsody. The old people are confused, yelling to one another \"is this Les Miserables??!\". At the climax of We Are The Champions all the lights turn on and bubbles again pour from the ceiling. At this point you can look around the crowd only to find out there isn't 16,000 people. There's 17,000.   Birthday requests are sent up on paper slips and the organist exalts praise to those  lucky enough to spend their B-Days in such an establishment. If your sad to leave don't worry, you can buy CDs in the gift shop.   The pizza wasn't bad. Good fluffy crust."}
{"text":"The music is definitely the reason why I would go back. However, the pizza is not something they specialize in. Tasted like frozen pizza. I went on a Sunday night and had no problem finding a seat. Make sure to bring CASH or be forced to use their ATM. Fun music, subpar food."}
{"text":"Can't believe we drive 40 miles for this place. What a joke! They only take cash or check, come-on in 2012, pay the merchant fee and get a credit card machine. Then you have to separately order and pay for food and drink. Yes that's right, go stand in two different lines. No refills on soft drinks, horrible beer selection and the worst BBQ chicken pizza I've had. I didn't know you could screw that up. We came, we tried, we won't be doing it again!"}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles... you don't get that kind of spectacle.  Especially while you're just looking to grab some pizza and a beer.  We get chuck e. cheese... not a grand organ orchestrated by the organ master!  Request \"The Choo Choo train\" or something like that.  The whole place seems to come alive.  Man, old people in AZ know how to have fun!  I didn't have much time in AZ, but this stop was definitely the highlight of my trip.  I'll definitely be back someday."}
{"text":"Overall a very good experience. Pizza is 7.5/10, salad bar 8/10... The organ music/display really is spectacular...particularly the first time you see it 10/10. ...it is quite odd/strange that they don't accept credit cards..."}
{"text":"For the kids, this is an excellent place to be.  With pizza, fun organ music, video games... this has a lot of help to make a great night for the family.  As for the pizza, I am from New Jersey; that should be enough for anyone to understand."}
{"text":"the food wasn't very good, and the organ player didn't seem to know any of the songs we requested."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, and an all around great place to take the family.  We went with a family of 12, and finding a seat together was a little hard since this place is very popular."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Music was so cool too! Great for all ages! He accepts requests to plus birthday announcements!  Accepts only $ or checks!"}
{"text":"I recently moved back to the valley and the pizza has improved. The sauce, toppings, and crust are all high quality and fresh. Organ Stop only gets better.  I love the music and it a great family friendly place to eat.  My daughter gets so excited when they play her request.  Lew Williams, the organist we saw on a Thursday night even played Stairway to Heaven on the organ! Wow.  I don't know if they still have classical concerts but I hope they do."}
{"text":"A slightly upgraded version of chuck e cheese's, but with worse pizza (if that's possible) and a real person instead of animatronic rodents performing the \"entertainment.\""}
{"text":"Impressive talent at that organ! Amazing visuals, sound, and history in one building. Pizza wasn't too bad either. :)"}
{"text":"Chuck E Cheese for retirees.  Don't take offense if you are a retiree because I am getting pretty close to that myself, I just thought that the crowd would be much younger. I was astounded at the sheer volume that place does on a weekend as the place was huge, people were packed in like sardines, I felt like I was at a KISS concert.  We had the kids with us and so no alcohol consumtion was possible....that might have helped.  Once we found a seat with aisleways that were not large enough to sit down without getting up every five seconds to let someone through, I had a chance to look around and was impressed with the building, which is the organ. Very cool ,thats why the two  stars.  Past the organ and the show, the place was a tad annoying starting with the fact that they only took cash and checks chiseled on stone tablets like the flintstones. I got in the long line to buy the pizza with the one check my honey gave me and then found out that to order drinks, I needed to get cash out of the ATM in order to get in a second long line to buy drinks.  Food was edible...not good, not the worst. Price was actually not bad, but keep in mind we did not drink.  I think next time I will just get some Totinos Party Pizzas, tune in the Lawrence Welk show and sit 6 people at a card table and the effect will be similar.  I would go back for the organ during the summer, on a week day, when they first open. I think if the crowd was smaller it would still be a cool place to take the kids."}
{"text":"Food....great pizza, excellent salad bar.  Ambiance....this is the best value in all of Arizona. The show is amazing. I have never seen anyone leave this place dissatisfied.   Staff.....ok.  Verdict.......EAT HERE!!! Take your out of town guests here. From kids to elderly everyone enjoys this place...good family entertainment."}
{"text":"Visited on 3/13/15 This is a real fun place. We bring everybody new to AZ here. The organ is very  unique. The pizza is affordable and taste good. If it was excellent pizza I would give 5 stars. Seating can be hard to find during the snow bird peak dinner times. I prefer to sit in the balcony so I see the organist. There is a salad bar and Ice cream.  Bring CASH. We always have a really good time."}
{"text":"This place really is quite special. It's a natural tourist trap, so expect to see plenty of pasty, obnoxious Canadians and so forth, but from what I hear it is a sort of local landmark.   I went for my birthday this year at the recommendation of a few work friends, and I had an incredible time. The pizza gets alot of flack, apparently, but I enjoyed it just fine. It's not likely to be mistaken for gourmet brick-oven pizza that snobs in Sedona eat, but it's still rather good from what I remember.  The organ was incredible. Gigantic. Played by a really good musician. The song selection is pretty universal, showtunes and the like, but just seeing the thing in action is remarkable. I highly recommend it. Now stop bashing the pizza!"}
{"text":"They only accept cash and the layout is terrible. You have to purchase the pizza separately from the drinks, and there is an ATM but charges a fee to use. No signs advertising that they only accept cash or check either, restrooms were decent"}
{"text":"Took my kids and their families to Organ Stop Pizza last Saturday.  Initially, I wasn't impressed with the service behind the counter or that they don't take debit/credit cards.  You also pay for food and drinks at separate counters...what?  I bought a salad bar but can only go through once...what? However, the entertainment was fun for all.  Cost is OK, food is OK. Service is average. Consideration of the needs of customers is below average (debit/credit not allowed), Entertainment is 5 starts for sure.  Overall, the kids loved it and had a enjoyable time.  At times, it was VERY loud but certainly entertaining.  We would go back.  Mainly for the entertainment and how much the kids enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My family always has fun when we come here, pizza is ok, appetizers are better and desert is good! The entertainment is always fantastic, the downside...cash only"}
{"text":"This place is probably more of an event than an everyday place.  The food is pretty decent. Pizza is good nothing special.  Garlic bread is ok as is the salad bar.  They do not take CC so make sure you have cash on hand although they do have an ATM on premise.   What makes this place special is the Organ. Go on the website to read about the history of this 1920's treasure.  With over 6000 pipes my kids are completely in awe of the sound that is produced.  Take your kids and friends they will love it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Been a regular for years.  Kinda over the Christmas in July music theme, (totally love the partnership with St. Mary's food bank).  Was pleasantly surprised, this organist didnt play ALL Christmas music, wish he wouldnt have been in such a rush though.  Great fun for kids and adults!"}
{"text":"We heard about this place mainly regarding the huge organ so while in the area we wanted to have the experience  We found the pizza below par, and over priced, with the entertainment worthy of the visit.    The three star is a combo of a five for the uniqueness of the entertainment and a 1.5 for the food.    As other reviews this place is noisy full of kids and seniors.    If I return I will avoid the pizza hoping the salad bar is more worthy."}
{"text":"This is a great, unique, original place.  My family loves it.  The truth is, if you read the reviews, they are all spot on in one way or another.  Yes, its cash only.....   yes, they make you stand in a second line to buy drinks, and salad, and ice cream.  yes, the pizza is not drawing Oprah Winfrey to it to declare it the best pizza in America.    BUT....  This is the most unique thing you will ever see.  The food is good enough, and priced about what you would expect.  In fact, I think the quality has actually gone up over the years, but pizza is like coffee - snobs abound speculating what makes a pizza great.  At the end of the day, this pizza is pretty good for the family.  No one complains, everyone eats full amounts.  But unlike other \"unique\" places that are \"unique\" because they have funny pictures of people urinating in the bathroom, or kayaks on the walls or whatever, this actually has an oddly unique entertainment concept.    We have tried it several ways, and do note, if you have not been, there is a method to the madness - if you swim with the fish, its far easier than swimming against the school.  What I mean by that is this:  The place gets PACKED.  When it opens there is a HUGE amount of people outside.  But their business goes in waves.  All the people crowd in, and order pizza at the same time, get drinks at the same time, sit at the same time, and for all practical purposes, leave at the same time.  The first \"Set\" is all old folks and families with tiny kids.  If you go with this crowd, get there 15 mins before it opens and don't freak when you are in a big line - you will get the seats you want.    But, the interesting thing, is that if you go later in the evening, at the end of each set, a large group of people will leave all at once.  This ends up being the best time to go, because there are no lines, and you get great seats.   It's inevitable, if its packed, wait 3o minutes and half the crowd will leave, all at once!    The organ itself is massive, and the instruments littered all over the roof, walls and back of the restaurant are controlled in time with the music.  In many cases, you can't really figure out which pipes are playing, but \"big\" songs like ITS A SMALL WORLD, and STAR WARS seem to use every instrument and its amazing.  Kids love it, old folks love it, everyone loves it.  (fair warning, I was one of those people that grew up with this place as a kid, in the 1970's.....  LOTS of great memories here, and my kids get the same experience that I had back then - it hasn't changed that much).    Later in the evening, things like the Canadian Flag descend and the Canada anthem plays, with lots of people getting up and singing and crying, followed by the Star Spangled Banner and Old Glory, Followed by Mickey Mouse Club flag, etc.  This is the kind of place, that you better stand and put your hand over your heart or you WILL get a WW2 Vet punching your jaw.  We bring all sorts of family and visitors here.  Do we bring them to show them that we have found the worlds best Pizza?  No.  A great Micro Brew selection?  oh no....  The best music you ever heard?  No (things played on an organ sound different).  But we take them here because when you add up all the small parts, its the most unique thing you have ever witnessed.  It comes off as one of those little niche concepts that some crazy inventor came up with that may work no where else but on this street corner.  Believe it, people come here to celebrate 50 yr wedding anniversaries and stuff - they read them out loud and its amazing.  This place, with all its random uniqueness is part of the culture of Phoenix and Arizona - which, is why it lands on lists for good dating experiences, etc.  If you propose to your future wife here, yes, you have no taste, but bring your kids here?  Then you are a cool dad! :-)"}
{"text":"My family and I love going to organ stop pizza. The kids look forward to requesting and seeing the cats. Everyone there is so nice. Pizza and ice cream are great!"}
{"text":"The pizza is ok, but you don't come for that. You come for the experience.  However, small children and teens may not like it, especially on nights where there's lots of senior citizens since they'll flood the suggestion box with tunes from 40-60 years ago, and kids who were born in the last 20 years will quickly get bored, since they won't recognize any of the songs."}
{"text":"Organ Stop is a family favorite! I ate there tonight for the first time in a few years and it as just as good as I remembered. The pizza is delicious and the atmosphere is so fun! A small pizza more than filled me up and it wasn't very expensive. It is a little loud while the organ is playing but that's why you come. They only miss out on getting 5 stars because of the cash only requirement. I love organ stop!"}
{"text":"Having read many of the reviews, I expected to enjoy the show and tolerate the food.  Our group was pleasantly surprised to enjoy both the pizza and salad bar as well as some ice cream for dessert..  While I didn't particularly love the music itself, the performance was excellent.  I loved watching the various parts of the organ as it was played, we are looking forward to returning with visiting friends."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to eat!  I love that this sort of entertainment still exists... I have seen several organists over the years and each one delivered a good experience.  They are always willing to play requests, even when customers ask for the same songs over and over- the musicians take that sort of monotony with grace, even though they must get tired of it.  The food is not amazing, but I have also never been disappointed.  The pizza is as good as any delivery restaurant, if not better.  Add garlic bread and ice cream for dessert, and we always leave happy.  The logistics are a bit unexpected- cash is required and the drink line is separate from the food order line.  But, to me that just adds to the old-school charm."}
{"text":"We love this place! The Wurlitzer is amazing and it even has dancing cats, a quacking duck and bubbles! The pizza is just good but the entertainment value is priceless... Especially when kids or Mom and Dad start dancing. We like to sit upstairs for the viewing."}
{"text":"My brother would not stop talking about this place. Finally he decided I had to go for my birthday. Wasn't sure if that was the best idea but I trusted my brother anyway. This was a few years ago mind you so I was turning 22 at the time. I wouldn't recommend this place to just adults but it is a family eatery for sure. The food was decent but what you really go there for the ambiance. The entire building is a HUGE instrument and one man controls them all. He does take requests and my brother graciously requested for him to play Happy Birthday for me as well as a Star Wars AND a Disney montage of songs....yes they do montages. It brought me to tears! It was so wonderful! Great for birthday parties because you can bring your own cake and the food is decent and cheap! I would probably compare the pizza to Peter Piper's pizza."}
{"text":"I cannot give any restaurant that is solely centered around ORGAN music less than 5 stars.  The pizza: to be honest, it's not that good. But if you're really hungry, it's actually kinda good. Just drench those little slices in ranch and peppers and life is good.   The beer: wait... There's beer here?!?! Heck yeah! At $3 a pint and $8 pitchers, not too shabby. Yeah they're all domestic, but hey, now you can drink a beer while you listen to your organ music.   The organ: oh the organ. Literally sweet music to my ears. And they take requests?! Ah yeah!!! Gimme summa dat \"Play That Funky Music\" immediately followed by \"Amazing Grace.\" Top 40 ain't got nothing!  The giant disco ball: yeah it's a thing here.   You might be surrounded by 70-something's and children under 5, but if you want a really 1970-chic spot to listen to organ, eat mediocre pizza, and drink domestic beer, look no further. It might be the only place in the entire universe where all of these worlds will converge."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 4.5. The food is great, the organ is fun (especially for kids) but everything is pretty outdated. If they update the area (the cups reminded me of the ones at buffets about 25 years ago) and take credit cards then it's a solid 5."}
{"text":"Always a hit with my out-of-town visitors. The musical show always impresses! I like their pizza. The crust is crispy but easy to chew. It comes out of the ovens in about 10 minutes. When you realize you're getting a theater experience plus dinner, the prices are reasonable.  $20 buys dinner and drinks for 2, with a couple of dollars left to tip the performers. The organists are very professional.  Atmosphere is very casual, like a German beer hall."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute disgrace to our nation. They play the Canadian anthem before the American national anthem."}
{"text":"Come for the entertainment and enjoy the food. Everyone in my family loved our experience. Do yourself a favor and request The Phantom Of The Opera. Take note: they do not accept credit or debit cards. There is a ATM in the lobby."}
{"text":"Honestly, the pizza was average (little caesars level) and the service is a little odd.  Order and pay for your pizza at this cashier.....can i add a drink....oh thats the 2nd line where you order and pay for any drinks.  All that said.....the entertainment is AWSOME!!  When i heard of it, i thought \"an organ....really....you gotta be kidding me, not interested\".  Then i went and saw.....freakin awesome.  The kids were mesmerized!!"}
{"text":"I am on a staycation with my wife and 3 of my 4 kids. We were in mesa pondering dinner when I had an aha moment. No not the lame band from the 80s. I remembered Organ Stop Pizza. Neither my wife nor I had been there in years. The pizza was adequate. It was very similar to Peter Piper. The sodas were a bummer. I paid for soda refills. The real reason to be here is the show. The show is fantastic!!!! There is so much to listen to and see. The music tends to be Disney and classical. My boys love giving their song suggestions. It was a wonderful night that I would suggest to everyone. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hooooleee what the H-E-double hockey sticks did I just walk into? That's when it clicked! All those mid-west license plates in the parking lot as I was walking into Organ Stop! My gob was agape from the moment I stepped through the doors. This place looks like how I imagine the mid-west would taste, big and bland. I mean I haven't seen a greater concentration of mid-westerns in the metro area outside of Sun City or Mill Ave in Tempe during football season. I mean it is definitely something I am... I mean... I uhhh... I don't regret going there. I didn't get the poops from the food or anything like that. So the pizza... I've had better frozen pizzas than what Organ Stop had to offer that hour or so. But hey! they have free refills on soda so that is worth a star.   Organ Stop is big and loud and there are kiddos running around having fun dropping off music requests with crossed-fingers but, the most striking thing about this place is its organ. *que obvious innuendos* Organ Stop is definitely well-endowed. It is a mighty organ. You can't miss it. It makes up an entire (2-story) wall and then spills out onto the other walls. It is really the only reason to go there. However, while I don't want to ever go there again, it does look like it's kind of fun for little humans whose brains are still developing (you can request music for the organist to play) as well as people who like big organs.  tee ell; dee arr: go for the organ, leave for the pizza."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my friend and her two kids. The kids and I had a large pepperoni pizza that I thought was pretty darn good. My friend has spaghetti and she said is was very good.  So is this gourmet? Did we expect gourmet? Of course not, what we got was pretty good food and a lot of fun. The kids thought the music was a blast.  They sang along with the Christmas songs and smiled the whole time. A lot of people on Yelp are complaining because the place only takes cash.  Well, this place has a feel from years gone past with the music and the flavor of the old times. Everything was cash years ago, quit complaining and pay as you eat, don't pay later with interest added on. The evening was a fun time for all of us and the kids want to come back again."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for a better night of really great Pizza, coupled with outstanding and professional entertainment brought to us by a superb and accomplished Organist who's versatility on a  Concert Organ was displayed amazingly, and spectacularly.   I was so taken up by his keyboard artistry that even long after I had finished my Pizza, I didn't want to leave.    He was just fascinating, not to mention the delicious Pizza."}
{"text":"So the pizza is fine and the entertainment fun and different but bring your cash cuz they don't take Visa... MasterCard...Discover...or AmEx... Really? I just think that's a sign a business is out to serve themselves and not their customers. Also, stand in line, order and pay for your pizza at one counter. Then go stand in another line and order and pay for your drinks. No refills on soda so if you want a refill go stand in line again and pay for a refill. Definitely flow issues at this place."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a recent vacation to Arizona.  It's one of the places you need to stop at while you're there.  A huge pipe organ playing all kinds of tunes.  The pizza was pretty good but it's more about the experience.  There's two levels so you can sit upstairs and overlook the stage or sit on the ground floor.  Worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through co-workers. It's a nice place to bring my mother when she visits... But I wouldn't return. The line to order was long, the drink line was unorganized, then it took forever to find a clean seat! Then we couldn't even see the man playing.... It's just not worth the hassle. The pizza wasn't bad--- but I would rather make my own."}
{"text":"Completely unaware of its reputation, I came here with my wife's family for a family gathering.  Well, they couldn't have picked a worse place for \"family gathering.\"  The place is loud (you have to shout to each other to carry a conversation), jam packed (we had to sit in tables in the opposite corners of the place), and the pizza is horrible (more on that soon).  To me, the only positive thing of the place is the organ music.  I guess that's how they earn their keep and draw the large crowd.  They take crowd requests, and the organist actually is quite good.  But that's about the only good thing of the whole experience.  As soon as we walked in, a huge sign greeted us \"Cash or checks only, no credit or debit cards.\"  What era are we in, 1940's?  In this day and age, the only places that accept cash only are those taking tax advantages.  And the pizza.  Tasted like cardboard with cheese and not-so-fresh toppings.  Any store-bought frozen pizza would have tasted better.  And then they cheated on the toppings too.  We ordered a 2-topping pie, only to see the number of pepperoni on ours being about half of that of a 1-topping pepperoni pizza.  Hello?  I paid for 2 toppings, not 2 different toppings splitting half-n-half.  Honestly, I really don't know how other reviewers think their pizza is even \"ok.\"  To this day, I could not believe anyone could ruin pizzas this badly.  Overall, the place has the ambience of a German beer hall during Oktoberfest.  Organ playing was kinda cool, and I can see how this is a \"family place\" cuz kids generally would like the music.  But the food is terrible.  If you want to come here, eat somewhere else first (get a hot dog from the gas stations nearby or something), then come enjoy the organ with ice cream.  But then again, if they screw up pizzas so badly, maybe you shouldn't brave the ice cream either."}
{"text":"It felt like Vegas. Please note, I like Vegas. If you don't like loud noises and bright, flashing lights in the dark, this isn't for you.  Lots of stimulation of the senses. The decorations are cool too. The giant organ is connected to the decor. Even the ceiling fans are on a cool mechanical system.  The pizza was good. Not too thick, not too thin. I only got pepperoni, but would like to try additional toppings.  It was fun to dance along to the music while eating. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The pros - The organ and the organ player, who was really good.  It was a unique experience. The cons - everything else.  Wait in one line to order your food.  Wait in another line to order your drinks.  Then try to find a seat.  We went at 6 on a week night and the place was packed.  And I didn't want to sit at a table with people that I didn't know.  This was our date night, and that's really weird.  Found a spot at the end of a table upstairs that was somewhat clean and not completely full, but still felt like a sardine in a can.  And from there, couldn't see the organ at all.  Screaming kid at the table behind us was really annoying, but I guess the parents thought it was noisy enough here that it was ok to just let her scream.  Got our food which was one step up from frozen pizza.  Husband wanted another drink, but not badly enough to climb over a bunch of people and wait in line again.  Probably an ok spot for a big family or school group or something, but not so much for a party of two."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to come here for a long time since its advertised as the best family friendly restaurant in the valley. We had a decent time, but they do not take credit cards which was a problem since not everyone brought cash. You also must wait in line for food, beverages, and dessert seperately! And carry it possibly upstairs yourself. The food was good, but it is so loud it was very difficult to hold a conversation. Our kids (2 boys) didn't appreciate the organ music, but I thought it was nice, different."}
{"text":"Crass incongruity at its worst. Or best? Is there a difference? This restaurant features average pizza and a magnificent pipe organ. My parents and I arrived just before the music began, and I was so excited at the prospect of hearing some of my favourite classical pieces. Oh, I was a fool.  The organist played marching band music and doo-wop. It was so loud that my deaf parents shut off their hearing aids. The customers actually interrupted their meals to stand at attention, and then cheered wildly when the organist played \"America the Beautiful\". My smartass dad asked, \"What song is this?\" A burly guy with shaved head and shark eyes sitting across from us responded by showing my dad his fist. His entire arm was covered in American flag tattoos.  An ideal place for the very young, very old, deaf, or fanatic."}
{"text":"Great place to take kids.  Been going since I was a kid - pizza is okay and cheap.  Cash only, but they have an ATM on the premises."}
{"text":"Organ stop is listed as a family friendly place this is not true we always go there for family birthday parties for the children.  The children who are all under seven years of age enjoy this we always sit clear to the front where there's an area against the front wall where the children like to get up and dance to the music.  Last night at a two-year-old's birthday party a woman who was sitting in the second-floor got quite upset because our our kids were dancing.  She actually ruined our party by demanding we make our kids sit down.  we left there and found her in front of the place standing on the patio smoking which is against the law you have to be 50 foot from that front door   What an unhappy sour woman.  We won't be back as it was an unnecessary  complaint."}
{"text":"I just returned from a Meet Up at the Organ Stop Pizza.   The line waiting to get into the building was very long, with people jostling each other impatiently. Prices were high for the quality of the food. I ordered a small 'Everything' pizza and small salad. The pizza was mediocre at best. The salad greens were wilted, the toppings were not fresh, and the dressings were warm.  The entertainment was glitzy, and very loud. The room was crowded. The people sitting behind me kept knocking into the bench I was sitting on, slowly pushing me into the table in front of me. I really didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.   I would not recommend this place for those who are used to higher end venues, if pizza is even high end, LOL!  If you go, make sure to take cash. They do not take credit or debit cards. They do have an ATM inside the building."}
{"text":"Have you ever felt the sentiment of when something is so bad it actually surpasses its badness and becomes good?  now let me ask you this......have you ever had that feeling where its so bad it becomes good then goes back to bad then meagerly yet triumphantly manages to fall into the GREAT category???   I give you... ORGAN STOP PIZZA!!!!!  Rule #1 You will want to be under the influence of ANYTHING upon entering this establishment.  -TRUST!!! ordering here is a nightmare..it's a really weird system..u may have to barter and/or trade wives or something to get pizza....could be cash only.. idk (or can remember [ I adhere strictly to Rule #1]) but do you really go for the pizza...or the experience-- this word needs to be italicized.  Rule #2 -You must drink alcohol while in this establishment!!! For your own sake! (be surprised they even serve alcohol here!)  Rule #3 - It is encouraged to request crazy-ass songs... \"they\" (being the crazy exclusive largest organ on earth made of cellophane/cardboard/packing tape illustrious organists) seriously know everything!! They even know Beyonce! for real, I swear one time they played \"Crazy In Love\".   -Also, you can totally take credit for this, but suggest to your friends a game where your group is versus every other patron/family there and try to totally dominate the request bowl.  here's a hint: suggest- \"moon river\", anything disney (\"under the sea\" boasts actual bubbles that float down from the ceiling and land in your pizza), I don't know the name of it but we call it the 'crazy cat song'...it includes a puppet show of 4 janky-azz cats that bop up and down behind the organist....they seriously look like they got the mange. definitely request that one..it WILL get played. in fact that's the only reason we go anymore..for the cats.  -Rule # whatever. sing really loud to annoy the 65+ ...once they leave you will be the only ones there...just like a private show!   -RULE: Don't forget to tip!  *and don't forget to stop at the \"gift shop\" on your way out!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay. I found the organ music to be pretty good, but don't expect to be able to have a conversation with the other people you go with. The pizza is good but not great. It tasted like frozen pizza to me, and it was overpriced for what it was. It was super crowded - I second the suggestion to arrive as soon as they open. I don't think I'll come here again. It wasn't worth the noise and the people. The counter staff also didn't understand English enough to know that I was asking if their iced tea was sweetened or unsweet.   Not going back, I think."}
{"text":"My grandparents figured I'd like this place because I am a musician, and had never been to an organ stop. First of all. The organ is very cool and interesting to watch while eating here... Kids will love it, as well as the older 60+ crowd.  However, the pizza just isn't that good or memorable in any way, you have to pay cash (which is annoying since I don't carry any these days, and wanted a beer), and they've eliminated servers and make you serve yourself like you're at a hot dog stand or something. Not cool. For the prices they charge, I should get a cute waitress, a really good pizza pie, and a charge for another pitcher of beer on my visa."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for 20+years even when they were at their first location. Tonight was the only time I can say I was extremely disapointed. Food always awesome! But the Organist was a jerk and unprofessional. We've always brought our kids year after year and we have kids(2) with Autism. My kids were dancing to the wonderful music and having fun with their cousins. They were a little hyper but I was reminding them to calm down,(part of the Autism behaviors). Honestly they were being kids.  And their were many other kids than just our party enjoying the music and dancing. After one of the songs the Organist calls us out over the intercom and then stared us down. So much for our always kid friendly destination. We've NEVER had this issue before in all the time we've visited. And even the staff was super nice.  Sad to have a musician get a power trip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a lot of fun! The food is not gourmet, but good. I ordered the large salad bar plate. It was reasonably priced and I piled it up to the sky. My wife ordered the vegetarian pizza and it wasn't bad!  The organist is very talented. He played all kinds of music and took some written requests. The place was packed. We got there a little before 4pm when it opened and stayed for 2 sets.   Check it out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place, maybe I've got an immature palate but I really loved the pizza and the organist was amazing. To be fair, my parents took me here as a kid and maybe for me it's nostalgia but I adored everything about coming here!"}
{"text":"Great place!  My family brought me here for the first time and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The organ player played a variety of classic tunes such as the Star Wars theme.  Lights would flash during the songs, and even bubbles rained down during a Little Mermaid song.  The pizza itself was pretty tasty.  Fortunately, they had plenty of gluten free options.  It can get a bit crowded and a bit noisy, but it's the most entertaining pizza joint I've been to."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the worlds biggest Wurlitzer! What more do you really need? Check out this musical oasis in the desert for a step back in time.  ***CASH ONLY***"}
{"text":"If you are in the Phoenix, Arizona area, specifically Mesa, you should definitely check this place out! What's better than listening to a talented organist play well known tunes on a ginormous organ (the world's largest Wurlitzer BTW) with a multitude of side instruments all while eating pizza? Well,  maybe a lot of things but this place IS really cool!   The pizza is decent for a pizza joint, lots of toppings to choose from and several specialty pizzas. There are also choices of appetizers, sandwiches and pastas available. I opted to add the salad bar which is your typical pizza place salad bar with a lot of toppings and a few side salad choices like potato and macaroni. All of the items were fresh and it was a nice addition to the pizza, however I wish it was offered for more than \"one trip only\". Beverages are ordered from a separate counter next to the salad bar which offers soda, beer and wine. Dessert is ice cream in a dish, cone or float, or go all out and get a sundae. Also remember to bring cash or check since it's all they accept (no plastic, but they have an ATM in lobby).   The entertainment is wonderful! The organist only talks a little bit between songs and the two times I've been there recently he played for a good 45 minutes to an hour before he took a break. He also sings happy birthday every set.   If you want to enjoy a different and unique place for dinner that includes entertainment definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and definitely worth checking out if you want something fun and unique to do in the valley.   Came here a couple of weeks ago for the first time and it was Christmas in July! It was very fun to hear the organ play Christmas carols, Disney songs, Phantom of the Opera, etc. Definitely worth stopping in here for the experience!  I will say that the food is, well, not great. I would equate their pizza to high school cafeteria quality. We also had an order of onion rings which were just okay. Their ice cream sundae was tasty, but the options for creating it were limited.   I'd recommend coming here for a drink or two to listen to the Organ, but don't bother with the food."}
{"text":"We love Organ Stop! When you have friends and family visit this is a great place to bring them!  The pizza and salad bar are pretty good. Great, affordable entertainment. Kids love this place!  If you can, plan to arrive just as a set is ending. It might be easier to find the seat you want. The upper seating area offers a nice clear view of the whole room.  It is cash only. There is an ATM in the lobby."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Organ Stop in 30 years! Took my daughter and her friends for a fun girls night out and the tears were flowing.  This is a magical place - special to native Arizonans from the East Valley. Nothing has changed,  including the alley cat puppets dancing in the background.  I highly recommend to families looking for a fun and affordable night out."}
{"text":"I've grown up with Organ Stop, since they first opened at the location off of Dobson road. (they are no longer there but at Stapley and Southern now) Food and entertainment are always the best here and now I have children that love this place just as much as I have.  Thank you for over 30 years of good times!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Organ stop 4 stars purely because of the organ. I would give the food and service 2 stars. It's cash only and that's just silly but beyond that they have a separate line to order pizza and then to order drinks!  The food is so so but really it's all about the experience and not the food. Kids live it and a word to the wise- don't go at prime dinner time. There will be a ton of old people and no seats."}
{"text":"This place is unique with great pizza. Am having guests from Texas next week and this is #1 on the list. Music is beautiful. You've never seen such a magnificent layout of what this organ can produce. It's a one of a kind experience! Be sure to go!"}
{"text":"Pizza not bad and live organ player. Had a good time. Will go agian."}
{"text":"The felt that the food at Organ Stop was just So-So! Nothing special! The Music there is great! You defiantly go to Organ Stop for the Organ! Not the Pizza!"}
{"text":"I came here because of the teacher appreciation giveaway which was much appreciated. While the food was good and the atmosphere was nice...there were some minor annoyances. It seems like they really nickel and dime you to death. They don't take cards, so you have to use an ATM to get cash. The ATM charges a 2.50 fee. You have to buy your drink separately and you don't get free refills. $1.50 for a 16 oz glass is ridiculous. There just seems to be a lot of things most restaurants give their customers that these guys charge you for...doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"The music makes the experience awesome! Pizza is good The salad bar is a must for 5.99 for a large salad it is a meal. The sundae bar is delicious I recommend the peach ice cream with chocolate sause whipped cream and nuts/ a dessert to die for :-) :-) :-) yum!! The one criticism is I didn't like their cheese bread A good night fun for the whole family I love listening to the mix of music/Disney,phantom,take me out to the ball game,star wars. Something everyone should experience at least once"}
{"text":"Went to hear and see the pipe organ, drink some beer, eat some pizza, and have a good time. Heard about this place on YouTube. we are not disappointed. The performance was great (understatement), the mood was extremely happy, and othe pizza was better than expected. Drove from Las Vegas to check it out and was more than glad we did. If you're in Phoenix, you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"First time to visit this restaurant. Completely satisfied with the entertainment and the food was okay. Arrived about 5 o'clock ( the restaurant opens at 4 o'clock) and the line was was about 15 minutes on a Tuesday. Seating was a bit of a challenge however we managed to locate a table up stairs..  we'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Pizza....meh Music...holy crap amazing. Best nights are when they play the Star Wars Medley.  Pure heaven.  Take cash or a checkbook, they don't take credit cards or visa."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed the music - the whole set up for the organ is amazing! My five year old daughter sat entranced through most of the numbers played by the organist.   For food we ordered a pizza, a pasta dish, and trip to the salad bar.   The salad bar was ok. For the price that you pay for the salad bar they give a very small plate (dessert plate style). My wife always gets her dressing on the side, but there was no small cup to do this. There were no employees in the area so she had to settle for dressing on the salad.   The pizza we ordered was a take on a Hawaiian pizza (we do pepperoni instead of ham). The pizza was good, but the crust was weird (very heavy feel to it).   My daughter wanted spaghetti and meatballs. She enjoyed it immensely. We wish that they offered kid size portions (kid's menu). She left half of the spaghetti due to being full. Unfortunately our hotel did not have a refrigerator, so we ended up wasting half the plate.   They also offer ice cream for dessert. There is a wide range of flavors offered. The ice cream was very creamy and no ice crystals.   We would definitely come back for the entertainment and dessert."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit if in the Phoenix area. The Wurlitzer organ is amazing including the multiple other instruments it controls around the room, very cool experience. The pizza is really good too. The set up provides maximum turn over. Walk in and up to the pizza counter to order food and pay and get a number. Go around to the side to order drinks and pay. Go to the end and buy Ice cream if you want it. Find a seat, watch the number board for your food and enjoy the show. No hostess or waiter just busers. Just FYI they do not take credit cards. Cash and check only."}
{"text":"Had a very fun time here tonight with my family & friends my two year old loved the music and lights and actually sat and watched while he ate his pizza. Kinda hard to talk to your neighbor while the music was playing but that's quite alright, can't wait to go back. Been waiting a long time to come here and I'm so glad I did, my son will love to come back as well. A++   The pizza wasn't all that great reminded me of Peter Piper Pizza or of the like but it wasn't horrible, you pay for the music really.. I did love the ice cream though, Butter Pecan was great.  Like I said, can't wait to come back :-)   ALSO! BRING CASH NO DEBIT OR CREDIT! ATM charges 2.50 for deduct :-("}
{"text":"Love this place! Pizza was really good and music was out of this world. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"We love this place! We saw Brett Valiant perform for the first time, and it was amazing! He pulled out all the stops, for sure! Our pizza was pretty darn good, too. The beer, well... We enjoy craft beers and tried a pitcher of Founders, but it was rather flat or wimpy for an IPA. But that won't stop us from returning! Organ Stop Pizza is THE reason we look forward to visiting the greater Phoenix area each year."}
{"text":"It was a great place to go to as far as watching the organ player and listening to the music.  The pizza on the other hand is nothing special at all.  It tasted like a frozen Digiornio pizza.  I would probably order pasta next time.  Pretty expensive too.  They only accept cash or checks.  No debit or credit cards.  You have to purchase your food and your drinks in two separate areas.  You have to pick up your food and carry it to your table.  No servers just bus people.  Iced tea they gave us free refills but pop you have to pay for refills."}
{"text":"Really fun place to eat!  We went on a Tuesday night around 6:30pm and we enjoyed it so much that we stayed until they closed at 9pm!  It was pretty busy but there were still plenty of open tables.  My 4 year old and my nieces and nephews (ages 1, 3, and 5) really enjoyed the music and the lights.  The gentleman playing the organ is simply amazing!  He played a huge variety of music- everything from the Beatles to Michael Jackson to Sinatra to Disney songs.  You can even request songs by filling out a request card and all of our requests were played :)  They serve pizza, a few other Italian dishes (I think I saw lasagna and spaghetti), and sandwiches or you can purchase a one time trip to their salad bar.  We had the pizza and it good.  We also made a trip to their ice cream counter for dessert.  They have about 15 different flavors and you can choose a cone, a dish, or a sundae.  They are definitely generous with the ice cream!  We got the one scoop cones but you'd think we ordered 2 or 3 scoops they were so big!  One thing to note- they do not accept credit or debit cards- only cash (and maybe checks??).  Overall a great time and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE !!!!! We love Dustin he was such an angel!! We could tell he loves his job and genuinely cares for his customers. I am definitely coming back just for him."}
{"text":"Love the organ...  Sad to see this Arizona historical treasure in such danger of mediocrity due to poor management.  The pizza we had wasn't worth taking home.  I didn't want to insult the cardboard box by putting pizza in it that is more tasteless than  itself.  Fix yer food folks!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing must see place. Live entertainment and the organ wall is just so cool. I didn't like how it was crowded after only an hour after opening for dinner but its just that popular. I'm sure the food was good but we couldn't find a place to sit and the lines look long for drinks and food too and I didn't see servers"}
{"text":"An incredible display of musical instruments from the massive organ pipes to pianos, accordions, xylophones, drums, dancing puppets and bubbles playing beloved and popular songs old and new.  I grew up with this place when it was first in central Phoenix.  The pizza and appetizers are excellent and so is the salad bar drinks and desserts.  The place is a cultural icon with some of the best talent ever."}
{"text":"This rating is for the food!! Our pizza was so-so. The organist is awesome & I recommend you come for the music/experience. I give the organist FIVE STARS!!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic.  The pizza's not all that great, to be honest, but the real attraction is the excellent, kitschy bit of old Americana you're seeing.  Organ Stop's players probably play the same sets of songs with the same effects that they were doing 20 years ago.  It's almost a rule that you have to hear Moon River, Chattanooga Choo Choo, and Alley Cat at least once.  I don't think this place ever really seems to change.  It's a Phoenix treasure and another cool example of the quirky stuff you can find in Mesa if you know where to look!"}
{"text":"You don't really go to Organ Stop for the pizza.  The organ is fun (especially for Grandma and Grandpa - as well as kids).    Ordering is a bit of an adventure - cattle call ordering line where they give you a number and you come back in another line to pick up your food.  There is also a third line because you can not order your drinks (soda, beer and wine) in the line where you order your pizza.  The pizza is made on a chain belt and is average at best.  I was pleasantly surprised by the lasagna I ordered and the spaghetti looked good but I didn't try it.  The real star of Organ Stop is the organ and the man who plays it.  It may sound corny but it is fun and it is a hoot to see the older gentlemen stand up and salute when they play \"Anchors Away\", \"Nothing can beat the US Air Corp or \"The Halls of Montazuma\"  In Summary  - average pizza, above average entertainment - worth taking your parents or grandparents to when they visit the Valley!"}
{"text":"Organ Stop Pizza is good for two things...organ music and pizza!    I know that sounds rather obvious from the name, but if you want to experience the body-shaking power of the world's largest Wurlitzer pipe organ while you eat a great tasting slice of pie at one of the oldest businesses in Mesa, this is the place for you!  There's really not much else to draw one in here.  I mean, it's not in the \"best\" part of town, the interior décor is well dated and the establishment is generally showing its age.    However, the power and complexity of the organ music is something that can only be experienced first-hand and the food, although a little pricey once you start stacking on toppings and drinks, keeps the great tastes and smells of a classic pizza house alive.    There is plenty of room for groups and events and it's not uncommon to have multiple birthday parties going on at once!  I believe private rooms are available, as well.    I will say that, when there are a bunch of children, it can get really loud and busy, but it's also the children's energy that helps make this place fun!   For those who want to sit back and relax, there are usually quieter spaces upstairs with great views of the organ.    If you're in the area and want to do something unique for a family dinner or birthday party, Organ Stop Pizza is a Phoenix-area classic that everyone should visit at least once!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst pizza I have ever eaten. Cardboard with flavorless sauce and cheap cheese.  Just terrible. I ordered 2 pies and returned 1 of them.  DO NOT GO HERE FOR THE PIZZA"}
{"text":"What a treasure! I love this place regardless of the mediocre or bad reviews. Who can say no to good music, wonderful light displays, and tasty pizza? It's a great place to keep everybody entertained! They have a little game room for the kiddos and  ice cream for us adults ;). BTW- FYI, bring cash. Only cash is accepted and while, there is an ATM machine, a processing fee is charged. Also the restaurant could get a bit crowded during the weekends, but hey, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Your experience is almost completely dependent on who's playing the organ on any given night.  If you have the misfortune of Charlie Balogh, it's your own fault because you should have checked the schedule before you went.  You will more than likely hear songs composed no later than 1968 which is fine if you're between 75-100 years old.  While there's a box for requests, it might as well lead to a paper shredder because Charlie prefers to play whatever he wants to hear or perhaps only what he knows how to play.  Try to keep requests simple and maybe they might get played, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Pop Goes the Weasel, etc."}
{"text":"You pay for the atmosphere more than the food. The food isn't the best but they do offer a gluten free option and I was able to bring dairy free cheese which they gladly put on my pizza for me. The music is loud and it is very hard to converse with other people in your party but it is a great show and they play lots of songs that most of us would know. We were able to sing along and have a great time. They also periodically had a bubble machine going so our kids loved that! Overall a great experience! It is a must try and a great tourist attraction. If you can wait to go until after 7, that is best because most of the older crowd and early dinner guests will have cleared out, resulting in more room and space to sit down."}
{"text":"This is a one of a kind, must see experience where you will hear very well played organ music and eat pizza!  What a clever combination.  The Organ Stop packs them in and people love it!  Kids dance, people stand up with their hands on their heart during their National Anthem (I heard THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER and O CANADA), and the music produces a resounding cacophony from all directions.    The organists who play here are well trained, experienced theater organists who can bring their preprogrammed beats and effects right into the song.  They take requests but obviously, not every request can be met.  The last time we were here, the music ranged from THRILLER to THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC to THE SOUND OF MUSIC MEDLEY and more.  All were fantastic!!  The pizza is good too.  Add a $5 pitcher of soda and a salad from the salad bar and you're on your way to a great night out.  There's also appetizers and ice cream available.  We like to sit on the second level so we can see the revolving stage better.  I LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Love to bring the family here! The only things I have an issue with is they don't take credit cards and some times it can take a while to get your pizza. The credit card thing i can understand a few years ago because having a credit card processor can be a hassle and it take money from the business... but its 2017 now. With things like PayPal Here and Square there really shouldn't be an reason you don't take credit and debit cards. as far as pizza time that can all depend on how busy it is. would still recommend this to people coming into town and for families."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take the kids for pizza and entertainment when you're sick of the stagnant Chuck E Cheese's franchise.  Their pizza, though not great, is better than most of the kid-oriented pizza places in town, and they offer more options on the menu (including alcoholic beverages for the grown-ups!).    The main attraction is the giant Wurlitzer organ in the middle of the large, two-story dining room.  I like the fact that the entertainment is included in the price of your meal, and it's actual LIVE entertainment - the organists even take audience requests.  I went with my fiance and his almost-5-year-old in December, when about 75% of the songs are holiday songs.  I recommend sitting on the second floor, where you get a great view of the organist and an up-close look at a variety of the instruments.    After about an hour, the organ music can become a little too much, but at that point, you'll be done with your meal and on your way out the door.  This is a definite must-see place for anyone with kids or out-of-town visitors, especially during the holiday season!"}
{"text":"We finally made our way across town to Organ Stop and the drive was totally worth it! The organist is amazing! He does the music all by memory, even the requests. The room alone is pretty cool with all the different instruments to compliment the organ. From Disney to Star Wars to Classical Pieces, my entire family (ages 1-65 years old) enjoyed the experience. They released bubbles during the Little Mermaid's \"Under the Sea\" which, of course, the kids loved! I'm not sure why people are griping about the pizza though. We thought that the pizza was exceptional and we're pretty picky about our pizzas! We ordered a couple regulars as well as a gluten free pizza for my mom and it was easily the best GF pizza we've had anywhere in the valley (go figure!!) 3 large pizzas plus a small order of fries that was actually quite large, ran about $50, fed 6 adults, 2 kids and provided ample leftovers. It would definitely be cheaper if you're not needing gluten free.  Sure, it's slightly annoying that they only take cash but they do have an ATM in the lobby if you don't plan ahead. The water tasted terrible. (Maybe that's just a City of Mesa thing?) so bring your own or just buy a pitcher of soda for $5.  Aside from those 2 negs., I would definitely recommend Organ Stop and I will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"this is the best place everrrrr! im definitely coming here again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG I TOTALLY loved this place. First time. It was fantastic. What a awesome concept. The organ player was phenomenal. I may never go again because it is pretty far from my house but I am so glad my sister convinced me to go. I am sure that organ playing is a lost art. Cross that off my bucket list! So worth the trip! And the food was pretty decent too. I totally did not expect that!"}
{"text":"Food was okay... pretty standard pizza but the ambience well worth your visit.  The organ is breathtaking.  The musician was extremely talented and played a wide range of different music.  There are lights, bubbles, a disco ball, and puppets.  This is definitely somewhere you want to bring out of town guests.  I've heard the weekends are insanely busy.  We came on a Wednesday night during the summer and didn't have to worry about long waits or no seats. They do not except cards so be sure to bring cash.  Prices are definitely reasonable I was surprised there was no cover charge but I'm used to California Where they charged you arm and leg for everything"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed Organ Stop Pizza for decades - since it was on 7th St & Missouri in Phoenix.  It is a fantastic place for family celebrations or just a fun spot to go relax, enjoy the organ entertainment and have really great pizza.  The pizza is some of the best I've eaten - has always been great.  Hot fudge sundaes are also yummy!  The only downside is that they are cash only - however, when you know that, it is not a downside.  They have a very successful business model and I for one am a loyal fan.  Keep up that great work, Organ Stop Pizza!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and will probably be my last time here too.  I will admit that it was a cool place to go to and see the biggest organ in the world.    The restaurant is two stories; they only take cash or checks for food and drinks. When the organ plays the lights go out and you cannot see your food that you are eating.  :(  Also luckily I had cash that night to pay for our food and drinks.    Well it was a cool place to go to and see the organ playing.  If the lights stayed on all the time I would probably give it another try."}
{"text":"It's Chucky Cheese for grown ups.  A huge , beautiful Wurlitzer fills the room with incredibly rich music and fidelity.  Songs seemed centered on the 50's and Broadway-sound of music, Music Man, etc.  Enjoyable,but a conversation killer.  So come to listen & eat.  The pizza is slightly above average.  We had a gluten free veggie & spicy meat pizza. The crust was surprisingly good and there was more cheese & toppings than average.  A little more sauce & it might have gotten 5 stars.  The organist takes breaks throughout the afternoon and evening.  Open at 4...Early enough for the blue hairs.  They close at 9pm. Note-no debit or credit.  Cash & checks only.  There's an ATM in the lobby if you're short cash.   And after your pizza you can add to the Caliries with an ice cream sundae."}
{"text":"Amazing, simply amazing.  I could not help but smile and enjoy the music.  Oh yeah, the pizza was good also.  We checked this place out for my son's eleventh birthday.  He loved all the different type of musical instruments hanging up from the walls to the ceiling.  Little did we know, we would be transported into a magical place where each instrument comes alive.  We sat in wonderment almost forgetting the pizza in front of us.  A must see!!!  An experience you'll appreciate!  LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Different twist to a pizza place and is a fun experience, if you like organ music that is! Pizza was good. Seating isn't ideal especially when it's busy, dirty tables and squeezing together. Overall, still fun and would recommend trying!"}
{"text":"Such a fun bit of Americana! A friend had his birthday celebration here and  I must say that it was quite the entertaining experience. Food's OK and not too badly priced, considering the entertainment that comes with it; and, $2 mugs of beer on tap ... yes!  The Wurlitzer was impressive: around 6000 pipes and 4 large turbine blowers make it one of the largest theater organs in the world. The pipes themselves, as well as accessory instruments - piano, percussion instruments, even a mechanical quacking duck - are scattered around the interior of the building and displayed and lit to become part of a grand light and sound show. I thoroughly enjoyed the organist's performance, which ranged from folk to pop (including adventure and sci-fi movie themes) to classical pieces. The performance ends with a sing-along.  Pretty much all ages are represented in the customer demographic, from toddlers to seniors, but leaning heavily toward family groups. Kids definitely love the place, as I saw many of them break away from their families to go beside the organ platform and spontaneously dance to the music."}
{"text":"Still the best dinner theater .Great for all ages .Very clean ,and nice ."}
{"text":"Honestly, there's nothing like it. Old time music played on multiple organs. A sight to see and experience. It is loud. Food is....pizza. Simple mediocre pizza. But an experience to share."}
{"text":"So interesting! The organ is huge and it has many attachments. Music is very entertaining.  My 11 and 5 yrs old were very entertained! The pizza was good, and appetizers (garlic bread, garlic bread with cheese and mozzarella sticks). Their fruit punch pint was really good too!"}
{"text":"When you review a place like Organ Stop, it is about so much more than the food. First point, you apparently have to get there when they open at 4 or you might not get seating for a while. We were visiting the in-laws in Sun City and were informed we would have to leave before 3 in order to get seating. Nothing like trying to go across Phoenix during rush hour for an early dinner.   When you get in, you can see that it is quite a display. A huge, colorful organ rises up on a dais and swivels back and forth while the organist plays. The organist is very talented and can play a wide variety of songs. There are small instruments on wall that play and even some puppets that periodically come out from behind a wall and dance. It is, like someone at the table next to ours described it, \"Chuck E Cheese for old people\".  When it comes to the food, the Chuck E Cheese comparison is pretty accurate. It really isn't anything special. Thank you to all the Yelpers who warned me about needing cash and about the separate food and drink lines. I suppose the separate lines makes some sense but the cash only is strange. Obviously, you go to a place like this for the entertainment, not the food. But, really, that only lasts so long. My 10 year old lasted about half an hour before clamoring for his iPad. I lasted only slightly longer. It's an interesting place to go to once but that might be about it."}
{"text":"So let me set the scene first, My church social group took a trip here last saturday. We are not your mothers church. The churhc is Community Church of Hope, We are the valleys largest GLBT church so when we desended upon Organ stop Pizza, in LDS land you know we look a little out of place. We had about 50 people from our church come and boy did we have fun.  There was a baptist church a couple rows down from us who didn't see it coming. Now we aren't a bunch of flamers frolicking around or anything but we do tend to get a little loud and generally have a great time. I did recognized some of the music  so I was able to sing along with those.  This is a great place to take anyone over 50.  I do think they might be washing dirtymob money or something since the business is cash only.........which I think caught a lot of people off guard including me.  The show starts at 530  so dont be late !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great music, friendly and helpful staff. Awesome place for family, birthdays, anniversary, anything really! Be prepared for a fairly noisy environment due to large crowd that this great place brings!"}
{"text":"Largest Wurlitzer pipe organ in the world with nearly 6000 pipes and valued at $5 million will \"blow\" you away.  Keep looking and you will discover more instruments playing.  Come for the pizza, soda and beer too."}
{"text":"I finally know the irony behind \"Phoenix's most romantic restaurant.\" If you've ever had the pleasure of asking Yelp Talkers for a suggestion on where to take a first date, second date, anniversary date, valentines date, or date of any type where romance is foremost on your list - you may have incidentally ended up here dressed in your best duds. I fortunately, didn't fall into that particular trap, I did however, show up here cause a friend had some family in town and invited us all out to dine with her.  What fun, I thought, I'll finally get to see what all the hubbaloo is about, I finally get to experience romance at it's finest. Secretly, I never really checked the place out at all, I didn't read about it, I had no real clue as to what this place was. I always just assumed it was some weird mixture of pizza joint, strip club, and themed in hospital recovery room and left it at that.   Boy was I wrong, and not necessarily in a good way. I will say that this is certainly an experience, one that you'll not have anywhere else, in town or out of town, except maybe unless there's another organ stop pizza somewhere. Touting the worlds largest Wurlitzer pipe organ, the name finally makes sense. Organ has nothing to do with the male organ, nothing to do with greasy pizza stopping your organs as you eat it, nothing to do with stripping, boy was I wrong, but I'm still not sure if I was wrong in a good way or bad.  Either way you 'slice' it, the pizza here is less than mediocre, but the ambiance! The ambiance less than makes up for the mediocre pizza. The thrill of pipe organs lasts only so long, and I think I clocked it at about 3 minutes and 47 seconds, but the kids all seemed to love it. I guess if you've got kids, feel like seeing the worlds largest Wurlitzer in action and in all it's glory, then you know where to go this Friday.  So Phoenix Yelpers, I hope I left you with some insight into Organ Stop Pizza and hopefully you don't get trapped in the age old Phoenix Yelp Talk question of \"Where's the most romantic place to take your girl?\" because unwittingly, you'll be sent here.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably fun! This place should br franchised.  Not on is it fun for the whole family, it's showcasing a seldom appreciated instrument, and amazing artista.  Everyone should see this, buy some pizza, and enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"Love the delicious personal-sized pizza at Organ Stop Pizza!!! It's just the right size and made fresh. The thin crust reminds me of Shakey's pizza. You can't beat the atmosphere either...Live entertainment on a Wurlitzer Organ!! Great, inexpensive evening out for the entire family! And don't miss their salad bar and yummy ice cream selection!"}
{"text":"Two words: great music. I went there for the experience and music. Cool mix of veteran and kids. Always a surprise."}
{"text":"Great music and the pizza has gotten much better over the last few years. If you are looking for great entertainment for \"kids of all ages\" and quality pizza, this is the place."}
{"text":"Organ Stop Pizza is a childhood favorite of mine. We visited this location as well as the downtown Phoenix location before it for years. Now that I live in the far west valley, it's been, easily 10 years since I last visited OSP.  We happened to be in the neighborhood for a Convention so we brought a large group of friends to experience OSP themselves.  First things first, this place is visited by a lot of retirees. And by a lot I'd say that we were the youngest group there by at least 50 years...and the glares to the kids in our group did not go unnoticed. But our kids are all very well behaved despite the daggered looks from those who forget what it's like to have children.   Speaking of children, OSP is not very kid-friendly when it comes to certain areas that we apparently take for granted. There are no cups with lids on them at all. We were informed that they need to have a special 'license' for that from Pepsi. This is news to me as I've worked with Pepsi for years and know of no special license. The excuse was that they were afraid that people would take the kid cups, put alcoholic beverages in them and walk out of the restaurant. um...WHAT? Additionally, if you have a child who requires his pizza cut up into smaller pieces, good luck trying to find a knife there. There was 1 and I mean o-n-e (1) butter knife in the whole restaurant that we practically had to sign over our first born child in order to use. I'm pretty sure that the retirees aren't looking to shank each other in the parking lot so to have to play verbal judo with the staff to use a standard utensil was really ridiculous.  The restaurant is now cash-only. This means no debit or credit cards are taken but they conveniently have an ATM machine located in the lobby to not only dispense cash but charge a hefty $3 fee to use. If you want to have a refill on your drink, there is a charge for that too. Buying drinks by the pitcher is fine but it's soda...seriously? The pizza is alright, the salad bar is 1 trip only and is sparse at best.   The single saving grace of it all is the Organ. The piece de resistance. This is a good thing and a bad thing because given all that I've described, its simply not enough for me to drive an hour out of my way for an otherwise aggravating time between musical sets. While you're there, it makes those aggravating occurrences not quite so bad though because it's such a unique, memorable, interesting experience. I loved OSP as a child and enjoyed so many wonderful, memorable visits. Unfortunately, it's not always enough."}
{"text":"Wow. How to review this place?  The pizza is about 3/5, salad good but it's one trip with the tiniest plate ever. Their service is counter service only but the show was a kick. Not what we expected at all but we had fun. For that alone, we will probably come back. It was fun to watch the crowd get into it and clap along with the organ."}
{"text":"At first glance, I wanted to run far away from this place.  I went on a double date and it seemed so loud that we weren't going to be able to talk.  It was packed and there were long lines for ordering pizza.  Be advised CASH ONLY!!  After we ordered our pizza, we scouted out for a table.   If you are patient and wait for the groups to clear out after the music, then it is fairly easy to get a good seat.  All of the instruments around the place were really neat, and they light up when they are being played.  The pizza here was awesome too!!  So, the music that he played....Star Wars theme-which was my second favorite.  The best song though was Phantom of the Opera.  It was memorizing and I fell in love with Organ Stop Pizza at that moment.  I am sure that the man is tired of playing those songs over and over but he was in good spirits and played them with a smile.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to go somewhere different and doesn't mind crowds or loud music.  Hell, even if you don't like crowds or loud music (most of the time I don't) I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The business model is as old as the organ!  If a business chooses not to take cards - I get it. I would love nothing but cash too with out merchant fees and tax reporting. But this could not be. Why? Because they take personal checks. So yeah, bring cash.   With such great entertainment for children and adults alike surely they have the food to match. The large cheese pizza cost 14 dollars and it tasted worse than a 5 dollar hot and ready from little caesars. The salad bar was a one pass and you had you had to pay for soda by the glass - at another cash register than the pizza order line. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"First of all, let's be clear that this is not the place to go if food is your priority!  Service is of the \"do it yourself\" variety, lines are long, pizza is \"Chicago priced\" at \"frozen food aisle\" quality, and they won't take a credit card! That being said, listening to a competent organist play \"The Mighty Wurlitzer\" is worth the aggravation.  Something to do at least once in your life!"}
{"text":"OK. Imagine the Grand Canyon had ice cream. Not the best ice cream, but hey it's ice cream. Would you tell people, \"Yeah I went to the grand canyon, but the ice cream was just alright. I don't know if I'd recommend it.\" If you would, take a run as fast as you can (head first) into a wall, come back and read this again.  No! The pizza isn't the best. But hey! It's pizzaI The Organ is what you are going for. Take your kids and anyone else you can pack into your car and go. Have a day!"}
{"text":"My family and I love organ stop pizza! It's such a fun environment, and the organ is so beautiful! The pizza is average (but i also don't like pizza that much), but going to listen to the organ is the real show! It's just a fun place to hang out and enjoy friends and family! :)"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY, PRICEY, LEAVE IT FOR THE TOURIST! Some friends wanted to eat here, because their senior parents love this place and would be dining with us. So we met friends and senior parents here for pizza. Let me just say this was not my thing.   CRAZY setup, you wait in a line and order your pizza. Then you go wait in a second line to order your beverages (paying separately). Then go sit at school cafeteria tables, in a VERY crowded, VERY loud dining room. Can't talk to anyone, the music is deafening. Packed WALL TO WALL with senior citizens. Which explains the taste.  Now I've had Chicago style, New York style, and even California style pizza. But this pizza is Nursing Home-Hospital style pizza; it's not good, taste a little better than a frozen Red Baron.  Organ music is good, would be better if not SO loud. Would be better if you only waited in one line for food and drinks and paid for them together. If these two things were different, I'd say worth a trip in for nostalgic reasons. Oh and it's CASH ONLY. So stop by the atm and pull out plenty, it's also pricey!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our second and likely final visit to Organ Stop. After going for the first time a few weeks ago (and leaving a glowing review on their facebook page) we were eagerly anticipating taking our family back. When we went in tonight, nearly every table on the main floor was dirty and full of dishes. Had a health inspector walked in, they would have likely been shut down on the spot. When we asked the counter staff to have some tables bussed we were told that \"someone would be by\". When the bussers finally arrived they seemed to move in slow motion, and did a poor job, and seemed annoyed when we asked them to wipe off the table properly. When my fiance expressed our displeasure to the \"assistant manager\" he nodded blankly and did not apologize. If you value your family's health, I would suggest not going in there until they clean up their act. The organ player and pizza were both good.  I will try to post photos of all of the dirty tables."}
{"text":"This is not your typical place to go out to dinner. They have a huge organ that a very skilled organist plays about a 15 to 20 minute set of music requests every hour or so.  Not my first choice for a dinner with family, but they were from out of town and my sister is a music major. Needless to say she loved it. The food is ok.. Nothing to write home about, but you aren't there for the food -you're there to hear the music! Lots of kids lots of seating- I think it it would be hectic if we went on a weekend- we went on a Thursday and seating was easy to find for a group of 5."}
{"text":"My two stars is for the food and ordering process.  I still thing going to the restaurant to experience the organ and bring friends or visitors is a must.  They only accept cash or check and that is always inconvenient.  Very few places don't take debit cards and I contantly have to remind myself to go to the bank on our way to Organ Stop.  You wait in line to order your food and it bothers me that I can't get mushrooms on only 1/4 of the pizza.  Toppings are only done in 1/2.  After you pay for your food you wait in a new line to get your drinks.  Frustrating!!!  The pizza is not even worth eating, IMO.  The fried appetizers are decent- I like the zucchini and mushrooms but not so much the mozzarella sticks.  The salad bar is an option.  The beer and wine is CHEAP.  If you want ice cream after your meal that is a third line you wait in."}
{"text":"What a fun and unique dining/entertainment experience in the Phoenix metro area!  My parents came to visit, so we decided to head out one night when it opened to catch the first two performances and eat some pizza and ice cream.  The food was surprisingly good and the entertainment was top notch - really fun way to spend an evening!"}
{"text":"Im in Phoenix visiting family for a week and thought that I should take the boys here. I remember going here when I was younger and generally enjoyed the atmosphere. For those that have never been, Organ Stop Pizza boasts of the worlds largest Wurlitzer theater organ. Whats the difference between a theatre organ and regular organ you ask? To put it simply, one operator and and entire acoustic orchestra at his fingertips; from a full jazz drum set, grand piano, upright piano, clave, marimba, horns etc. and the operator plays them ALL. It is a sight to see.  This is a large building, designed like to be like an old theatre. When you come in pay attention to the exterior of the building as you can see some of the components used to operate the organ. The 32' diaphones and the turbine blower facility are all visible from the exterior. Parking is a breeze.  As you enter the building you come the the main counter where you immediately see the food menu. To your right is the bathrooms and the ATM. Pizza prices start at $5.49 to $18.99. After we placed our order the woman kindly advised us, we needed to go around the corner to pay for drinks, and CASH ONLY! PLEASE USE THE ATM. My stepfather and I looked at one another in total disbelief that a place of this size would not have a credit card machine. Maybe it is some mafia stuff, to get more money using their ATM. Crazy mentality none-the-less.  Finding a seat on the lower level, during peak times,  that will accommodate someone in powered chair is difficult. With this being centralized around snow-birds (retirees who travel to warmer climates during winter) you would think that they would have someone seating everyone and managing pedestrian traffic but that is not the case. After roughly 15 minutes we were able to find a seat that would accommodate our party and waited another 10 for our pizza. If you look towards the ceiling you will see a numerical board with numbers that can be illuminated. Look for your number and head to the counter to get your pizza.  Their pizza is great and it has a nostalgic feeling and taste to it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if this review is solely on food, it would be a fail and probably 1 star. The only redeemable aspect of the food for me was the fried mushrooms. That's saying a lot for a \"pizza restaurant\". Let's face it the pizza is on par with Little Caesars and Cici's but 3-4x the price.   Now to the positives. Realistically people do not come here for the food, or at least shouldn't. The draw here is the atmosphere, music, and pipes. Essentially, you have a very busy, loud cafeteria without the rude lunch ladies. Everyone is very helpful and polite though. The service is semi self serve but they do a very good job at busing the tables. Word of advice for people who want to bring small children, bring hearing protection as it can get very loud with some of the song selections.   As to the actual entertainment, it is very enjoyable and is interactive with song requests. Honestly, the organ is the only redeemable quality to this place and that saddens me because I would love frequent it more but the food quality puts this restaurant in the category of only when 'Rents come into town, which is once a year at best."}
{"text":"Bad Pizza, very bad pizza... I think most people are being very generous to say it's OK. I love the atmosphere here, the organ is great... Very bad pizza. I can only imagine how great this \"once every 5 year\" place could be if they had even \"good\" pizza, it would not even have to be great! Another yelp-er, compared this place to going to the grand canyon, you know, something you got to do.  I agree you need to go here... I actually brought my own pizza from Old Chicago, the last time I went... No one even tried to stop us. I think the wait staff understood, every time they passed our table they smiled. We got ice cream for desert and also left a big tip... This place has Pizza in it's name I would give more stars if they called it Organ World and charged for admission."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place to visit every few years.  The kids love it and the food does is as is expected.  It can get a bit crowded and their ordering methods are a bit outdated.    Make sure that you bring cash!"}
{"text":"Loved the music - best part of the visit - quite entertaining, nice selection of songs.  Great for kids, our little ones (potentially grumpy from too much pool time) danced around to the music, played some arcade games; adults could visit.  The pizza was not so great in my opinion - we had one meat combo and a pepperoni.  Sort of like Chuck E Cheese -  overly dry (Really could have used more sauce and cheese), and the toppings weren't the best quality.  Salad bar was okay - a bit overpriced.  It was a good choice for the family, but the pizza was not the draw."}
{"text":"This review is just for service. Came here with my husband and kids on a Sunday at 2:30 in the afternoon. Starving. Never ate here, but heard about it so we wanted to check it out. Drove over to Mesa and walked in to be instantly turned away. So rude. The guy acted as if we were going to set a bomb off in the place! Came running over and told us that we have to wait a half hr before we can be seated. OK. I'm starving, but we came all the way here so we will wait. There is a game room for the kids and a bench for us to sit and wait. NOPE. Not allowed  to wait in the building at all.  His older man that was panicking that we were there came up to us and told us we have to leave the entire building. This place is pretty big too... I don't see how us hanging in the game room is bothering them while they do whatever they need to do to prepare the dining room. Made no sense. Lots customers. Not sure if we will ever make the trip back because hey, ya never know if they will just be randomly closed on a Sunday afternoon!! Ugh. Did end up finding a great pizza place in downtown Mesa though. Queens Pizza and the waitstaff was awesome."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers a very unique experience with live music from an pipe organ.  The musician played a lot of popular kid songs to appease the children in the restaurant.  The pizza was decent and the pitcher of beer was cheap. Overall, the atmosphere was fun and quite memorable.  I definitely recommend it for families."}
{"text":"This place is always a great time. It's weird but very entertaining. I can't stop looking around at the massive organ when I eat here. The pizza is one of my favorites in town and I eat A LOT of pizza. They have good ice cream there as well."}
{"text":"I had a great time when I brought my mother, who came from out of town. The system was a bit confusing at first, but easy once you get it. They basically give you a number after you order your food, then you grab a seat somewhere, then wait until you see your number light up on a large scoreboard on the side of the building and get your order at the pickup area. It's not hard. The pepperoni pizza we ordered was hot, cheesy and tasty! A little pricey, but I think the price you pay is also for the show. The music was magical and fun and it was entertaining. I don't think it was any louder than music you'd hear at any bar tbh. Anyone who says differently may be over 70 or probably never frequent places with music playing overhead. You DO have to pay for refills but you can also buy pitchers which will save you some trips. We really enjoyed our time here and will be back again."}
{"text":"Organ Stop Pizza -- one of my favourite places to go when I'm in the Phoenix Metropolitan area.  First off, don't get me started with all the reviews about the pizza -- its average at best and yes, its expensive.  You don't come here for the food -- you come for the entertainment.  Watching the professionals that play that monster of a Wurlitzer Theatre Organ is what you're paying to see.  The best views and best sounds are on the 2nd floor -- there is no elevator, take the stairs to the left/right.  Also, the large wooden pipes in the back throw out some of the deepest bass I've ever heard and felt.  Its also funny to watch peoples hair literally get blown around by these pipes.    Again, the pizza isn't the attraction:  its just something nice to snack on while you listen to and watch this amazing machine."}
{"text":"Five star for the experience and the amazing organ player who apparently knows every song in the world by memory! Pizza is better than a Peter Piperish place, but that's definitely not why you go. The organ is amazing and the kids love it. The history of it is pretty cool too!"}
{"text":"So la la.  Novelty for sure.  Pizza sucks hardcore.  Lot of old people.  Worthwhile seeing once but don't go out of your way unless you're a masochist.    It does get lined up, I'd recommend not being s total rookie and let the crowd thin, then. Reese in an hour after they open.  There'll still be plenty of seating.   Sucks for pictures, pretty dark.  Just go and enjoy and remember what I told you, expect the worst and hope for the best."}
{"text":"While the star at this place is not the pizza, it is definitely satisfactory.  However, the atmosphere is great, and the organs make this restaurant worth going to.  The organists are always fantastic, and they play requests throughout the meal.  Kids love watching the organs, so it provides a fun night of entertainment for any family."}
{"text":"Well we finally tried this Arizona landmark. Everything that you've heard is true. Food is mediocre, organ and room is entertaining. The building is all pipes! It resembles an Octoberfest Brewhaus, with a balcony, and long tables with seating in the round. You pay cash for your food and wait to see your number on a board. You then go pick it up and walk it upstairs. Not ideal but ok.   Food was blah. Organist and atmosphere was something we haven't seen before.   Every one at the table said, so we got this place outta the way. Meaning we've all been trying to experience it. We have. Now we can move on. It's hard to say if I'll go back."}
{"text":"The organist is both talented and humorous, playing a wide range of requested tunes like Frozen, the Big Band era, and patriotic numbers. The available sound effects, lighting (including a disco ball), and instrumentation is great. It entertained folks from age 3 to 80, which made it a great multi-generational night out.    Beyond the music, the pizza and salad bar aren't bad either. It can be slightly inconvenient to have the drinks paid for separately from the pizza, and in being cash only, but definitely enjoyable."}
{"text":"It's sooooo loud!!!  The kiddos loved it!  While my ears were ringing, we had a large salad from the salad bar and a medium combination pizza.  I added a small personal cheese and fried zucchini.  I would not call that a vegetable, but it was good.  My little cutie pie and nephew were dancing to the music while eating.  I told them that this would be the ONLY place they could do that.    I looked around and there were elderlies, young couples and small families enjoying the music entertainment.  It was a fun night!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, fabulous entertainment by a great musician. You have to see it to believe it.  Food is great. Pizza was crisp at the bottom and a great taste. It was non greasy."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my partners and their wives and their children.  The pizza and food is fairly good. Nothing spectacular here. Most come for the entertainment whish was wonderful. There is a huge organ as the centerpiece of the restaurant.  We had a wonderful time singing along to the tunes and the organ has so much going on it was a delight to just sit and watch as the oranist played.   I do wish they played longer sets however.  Service was 5/5. Fod wa 3/5.  Overall 4/5."}
{"text":"Just the best!!  Great pizza!  Great music!!!  Love this place!!!!  Have be going for more than 40 years to organ stop.  Place is packed be still fast and fun!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good! Ordered the pepperoni and cheese pizza. I wasn't a fan of their beer options but this isn't a place for drinking. The entertainment was really good! Really good spot for families and older crowd."}
{"text":"I brought my family here from out of town and it was a very memorable evening. What I like most about this place is that there isn't another one like it anywhere in the world. Very very unique. Food is great and drinks are cheap. The entertainment is stellar and the atmosphere is welcoming. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Very fun, especially for little kids :) the guy playing the organ is great and takes requests which is very impressive. Love the song selection and the lights and bubbles. The pizza is ok, not the best, and remember to bring cash, they don't take cards, just cash out check."}
{"text":"They don't have any signs saying they only accept cash,  but they only accept cash.    So after you order,  you then have to walk over to the ATM \"conveniently\" located 20 feet from the register,   PAY A FEE,   bring the cash straight over to the cashier in plain view,  where the cashier will then spend 5 minutes scrutinizing the bills you JUST GOT FROM THEIR ATM to make sure they're not counterfeit.        I really hate... loathe this practice of deliberately shucking the cash fee onto the customer;  if we swiped at the register it might cost an extra half a percent or whatever Visa's fee is,  but because they do the stupid ATM game it's $2 + the $2.50 Wells Fargo charges for a non-WF ATM added on to my $35 crappy-pie-and-awful-beer dinner.     That sucks.     The pie itself is pretty expensive... well, I guess it comes with a unique show right?  Then you have to walk over to another counter to order drinks in a separate transaction,  and the drinks will be served in a crusty old cup that smells and tastes like dish soap.   The pizza itself is sub-mediocre.      The show,  while absolutely unique,  is too robotic and genericized to really be of much entertainment value... I know that not just anybody can play such an instrument so the few people who can & do are probably less than thrilled to have to put on the same show night after night,  and can't really be expected to insert thrills and magic into each and every performance - I say this without sarcasm, it's probably really not the most rewarding career on earth - but the result is kinda like going to chuck-e-cheese.     So, in summary,  Organ Stop Pizza is awful and I wish one of those business makeover shows would come fix the restaurant problems so it's possible to actually enjoy the amazing facility."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Organ Stop Pizza since I was a toddler. Great entertainment for adults and children. Pizza is delicious, and affordable. Great for large or small groups."}
{"text":"Organ Stop Pizza is an ATTRACTION that sells food. The food isn't the best just like from any other attraction but I do note they are very clean and post a Grade \"A\" Health Inspection Sign.  That said this is a very casual large family friendly place where you order at the counter, pay, get your drinks and silverware, seat yourself and look to a giant board on the wall for your number and pick up your food yourself.   The attraction is seeing and hearing one of the largest Wurlitzer Organs in the world. Not all but many of the songs played are theme songs. I heard the Star Wars Theme Song followed by the Star Trek Theme Song. I heard American Theme Songs and lots of Disney Theme Songs. Beware lots of young children all around dancing to the music between tables. Lots of family gatherings with birthday parties too.  Downstairs they have setting for about 500 people in bench style tables. It is very loud downstairs but you are closer to the organ can see more of the organ around the room.  Upstairs is smaller and seats around 200 people with tables. Upstairs might be the romantic spot because you are near the woofers and the seats vibrate a lot when the Titanic Theme Song is played.  The salad bar is similar to what budget steak houses offer but the difference is that everything was fresh.  The pizza is similar to a frozen pizza but slightly better. The crust is thin and crispy covered in corn meal or semolina and the cheese is better than from a frozen pizza.  Nobody waits on you but they do have bus people to clear the plates and clean.  For those that get board of the organ playing people can spend time in the arcade or shop for stuffed animals and organ playing music at the gift shop.  Parking is easy in the very large parking lot.  This place was fun and should be on everyone's bucket list!"}
{"text":"Fun, unusual, unexpected treat in the desert.  Bring the kids."}
{"text":"My kids love it here! I've lived in the valley many years and only heard about this place recently. I'm surprised it never comes up in the things to do around town? They even have gluten free pizza. Check it out."}
{"text":"A large 1 topping pizza is $14.79 plus tax and is about the same quality as freezer pizzas. So why the 4 stars? The entertainment. What you are actually paying for is a pipe organ recital (in a fun way) with imaginative, fun lighting and animated characters. The noise level can be pretty intense here and indeed many families are not very good at supervising their obviously over-stimulated children. The lines can be quite long to order food, but they assign you a number which lights up on a large board so that you can return to the entertainment until your food is ready for pick up at the counter. A non-mall location (bonus points), easy parking, talented organists, and friendly staff. This place will delight your children and the inner child in you."}
{"text":"Very cool place to try at least once! Pizza is extremely good and loud fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Fun place, very unique. Obviosly the main feature is the organist and the broad array of aspects of the organ. The organist was phenomenal and could play every request that was given to him. We couldnt believe how many different things he controlled with the gorgeous organ. The cat puppets were creepy.  Food: I would give the pizza a 6/10. The crust was a little crisp for my liking.   Seating: Sit up top in the middle. These seats get taken first and the sides have pillars that slightly block your view, not bad though.  Bring CASH ONLY! They don't take cards."}
{"text":"Despite spending many years growing up in Mesa, I was one of my few friends to not attend this particular neighborhood staple. Last night I visited with a social group that I belong to, and I have to say that it was everything I was worried it was gonna be.  The food was awful, the service was terrible, and the organ was so loud it made the one positive thing about this place an utter annoyance.  Our group was seated upstairs, which meant that we had to come up and down the stairs and carry our pizza, appetizers, drinks, pitchers of beer ourselves. This was a big turn off for me. After years of serving tables, I have no issue with it, but I watched several friends spill things.   The place was run down and desperately in need of a deep cleaning. Especially the filthy carpets.  When I ordered my Diet Pepsi, I was asked if I wanted it without caffeine or with? Instant reminder that I was in mesa. I don't recall stuttering, but I politely told him that I wanted regular Diet Pepsi. The employee had this incredible judgmental look on his face while serving me. Another thing I don't miss about living in Mesa.  AND NO FREE REFILLS ON SODA! What kind of ridiculous nickel and dime tactic is that? You have a soda fountain. Assuming you are using 5 gallon BIB's, even with free refills, your profit margin would still be insane.    When we came down to pick up our pizza and appetizer combo basket, the employee spilled the combo basket. No apologies, no compensation, just \"I'll get a new one but it will be about 10 minutes\"   By the time it was remade, we had finished our pizza, and we were done eating. After we tried a few pieces of what was clearly frozen appetizers off the back of a truck, we left them on the table for friends to pick at.  The pizza was horrible. Toppings, cheese, and sauce were ok, but the crust reminded me of one of those disgusting Totinos frozen pizzas. Not worth the 20 bucks they charged. I've had better pizza from Little Caesars. Which isn't saying a hell of a lot.  The organist was very talented, but frankly, it's just too damn loud in there. While the music is playing, you can't converse with anyone in your party without shouting at the top of your lungs. Not to mention that the song selection was so family friendly it was nauseating. AMAZING GRACE isn't exactly the most uplifting dinner song when all it's ever been used for is funerals and launching vulcans into deep space.  Long story short... I'm glad I experienced it, so that I might warn others. I will not be returning.  If you go, go for the music and consider the crappy food, and service a cover charge."}
{"text":"Make certain you arrive as soon as they open. Check their website for what time they will open. It differs between seasons/ weekends/week days. If you wait til later in the day, the restaurant will Be packed and you will have a difficult time finding a seat. Eat VERY slow and enjoy the music. Organ player begins playing 30 min after they open and he takes requests. Place your order than find a seat while you watch for your number. Drinks and ice cream are paid separately. When your number is posted go back to the counter to pick up your order. We sat upstairs, chairs were comfortable. Downstairs seating is on picnic style benches. Pizzas are absolutely Delicious !!!!! They also offer spaghetti and hot sandwiches. The organist plays for 30 min. Than takes a 15 min break. Plan on eating slow and staying awhile, it's well worth the stay. Relax and enjoy . Oh yes they also have a salad bar with a pretty Good selection."}
{"text":"Brought my family here from Minnesota. It was a fun outing- dinner and a show. We really liked the PSM pizza and zucchini sticks."}
{"text":"You don't come for the run-of-the-mill pizza. Nor do you show up for the cheap pitchers of beer. No, you make it here for the show. A massive organ fills the entire building, incorporating dozens of intruments, and the virtuosos playing it take center stage. Sit back and watch then perform your favorite songs, from Star Wars to The Little Mermaid. Don't let the average food dissuade you from a one-of-a-kind experience."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  When you walk in, it looks like a Chuck E. Cheese minus the skiball.  Their menu is pretty simple, and you pay for things separately (cash only).  Service was great! The food is alright.  But honestly, you don't go here for the food.    I don't go out of my way to listen to organ music.  But this guy was great!  And it was mesmerizing.  He played standards, Disney, and even played bohemian rhapsody on this thing.  It was awesome!   Each time we thought we would leave, he'd play something crazy like Thriller and we'd get sucked back in.  I bet Christmas music is bomb!   This is something to experience.  Get a pizza, enjoy it.  There really is nothing like it."}
{"text":"We've been to this place several times over the years. As a matter of fact, our family celebrated my daughter's second and fifth birthdays here (we did not have a \"party\" - so I'm not sure how that works - we just brought our own cake and had dinner here).   Anyone complaining about the pizza is missing the point. We don't come here to have a culinary experience; we come for the show (although the pizza is not bad. It's not great. It's exactly what you think it will taste like while you are reading this review. It's pizza, and you will probably like it unless you are really picky). I like the pizza, I love the fried mushrooms and... well, that's what we always get. We talk about getting dessert but then we fill up on that (good) pizza.   But the real reason to come is the ambiance, and of course the music. The organists know how to play songs that everyone can recognize and there is something for everyone to get excited about (the theme songs from Indiana Jones, Ghostbusters,and Star Wars, Thriller, Bohemian Rhapsody, etc.) Not only does the beautiful organ emerge from middle of a stage (and descend back into the stage during intermissions); there is movement on the walls from various instruments, and a little light show happening at the same time. My favorite part is when a curtain opens over a little alcove where four cat puppets dance. Kids love this place. Old people love this place. (They really do. Bring your grandma; she will love this place). And I love this place. It's been around for over 40 years, so most locals have been to it or at least heard of it. It's definitely worth checking out whether you live here or are passing through."}
{"text":"Organ Stop has been a favorite for years.  Not very close, the playfulness of the place make the trip so worth it.  The pizza is almost the best on the planet.  The crew are friendly and eager to help. The 2 organists are top flight and if you want, their CD's can be bought. The queue can be horrendous even just a little after opening so get there early or a couple hours after they open - after usual dinner time. But the quality of the food it worth it!!"}
{"text":"After driving out to Mesa from Phoenix, we found this place to be HUGE,  with about a three acre parking lot...totally jammed...Inside there was a long line and the dining room , on two floors was packed to the rafters.  We would have had to wander around for a week to get a table. The organ is pretty impressive, and the music was nifty, but the crowd and the chaos were not so nifty.   They do not take credit cards- is there ANY restaurant that does not take plastic  any more?- only cash or checks (!).   They had an ATM but I was afraid to see how much they charged for cash.  The prices seemed  OK, but the pizza didn't look all that wonderful- I guess they're selling the organ music.  The clientele was young couples with kids- noisy ones- and old snowbirds from Canada.  The ambiance was part Vegas early-bird senior buffet and part Cub Scout Jamboree, unsupervised.  There's no service.  You order at the desk and come back and get it when it is done.   I dunno- maybe you like that sort of thing.  Ain't my cup o' tea.  Maybe a return visit on a Tuesday in July."}
{"text":"They have gluten free pizza too. There is a great salad bar. The organ music is fun and excellent. I'll be back.  News article ABC15 http://youtu.be/7Mtr-Bi8liE  Check YouTube for more videos."}
{"text":"Good food. Organ is great and you can put in requests of your favorite songs. Like star wars or phantom of the opra"}
{"text":"Organ Stop Pizza - A Favorite for Young & Old Alike!  While I am not the biggest fan of Organ Stop, I do find it somewhat entertaining.  It is always fun to watch the young ones sing along and dance to the music!  However, many times it's the Seniors that have the most fun!  I am not sure why, but Senior Citizens love this place (so you might not want to come early)!  I honestly think they shuttle seniors in, there are that many...  The pizza is okay, though I like pretty much all pizza!  If you are in the area, or have kids or grandparents, give it a try!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"What a great time!! Pizza is delicious and salad bar!! We love listening to the organ! We could spend hours here. BRING CASH OR CHECK! They do not accept cards."}
{"text":"One word: Kitsche. I was looking for a fun dinner \"experience\" to treat my daughter to. This place comes up in every family dining guide and I guess it's because only kids under 7 would not be completely horrified by this place.   First of all - cash only. You stand in line to order. The food is overpriced and very sub-par. You have to cram yourself in on a bench next to strangers (unless you have a group big enough to take up the whole table - maybe 6-10people?). You will probably lose your seat if you need to get up and order another drink or use the restroom.   The organ plays... Interesting... Pieces of music. It *is* cool to see how different parts of the room sync with the organ/music as it plays. However it was not worth the overall experience of being smushed next to strangers, overpaying and eating bad food.   I will admit - my daughter was enthralled by the \"finale\" song of each set - where they blow bubbles and the disco ball comes out and it's like a 2minute party in the room. But again... Not worth it. It's 2 min of smiles and 60min of torture."}
{"text":"I had a hot date last Saturday night at the Organ Stop... and it definitely ended on a high note (pun intended).  Of course, my \"date\" was my 3 yr old son and the night ended at 6:30pm with strawberry ice cream - but if that's the kind of night you're looking for then the Organ Stop won't disappoint :)  We arrived at 4:45 to beat the rush but I didn't anticipate the senior citizen rush that had started at 4:30, so it was crowded.  We waited about 10 min in line for food but I was prepared with my order and cash so it went smoothly enough.  The dining room was PACKED no lie.  There were a few open tables but only in corners upstairs where you couldn't see the organist, so what would be the point?  We finally found 3 people sitting at an 8 person table near the stage who were nice enough to share with my son and me.  Honestly, all the people there seemed really nice; they were mostly older and smiled and laughed at my son when he was being his exuberant self during the music.  I was pretty astonished at how well he behaved.  It took about 20 min after we sat down for our food to be ready - small pizza, basket of fried zucchini, mushrooms, and mozzarella, and small salad.  I thought the food was good, not amazing but better than some of the other posters made it sound.  The salad bar was very basic and definitely the low point of our meal, but at $2.99 not a huge deal.  My son enjoyed his pizza, so if he eats - I'm happy.  The organist was fantastic!  Some of the songs he played were that Dancing Cats song with the puppets (my son was mesmerized), theme from Star Wars (my fave), A Wonderful World, some kind of Choo Choo train song, Abba, etc.  There was also a set of patriotic songs played for soldiers in the audience which I thought was cool.  In summary, it was a fun place to take my son for dinner.  Everyone was friendly, the beer was cheap (yes, I had a pint, shhh) , and my kid was entertained long enough for me to actually finish my own dinner before telling me he wanted to leave.  I will be taking him again for sure!"}
{"text":"This was our second time there. The first was during regular hours, this time during special group hours. The performance on the huge theater organ was excellent both times, and is fun for all. The pizza is adequate."}
{"text":"I went to Organ Stop for the first time this year and enjoyed it.  Not the food!  The food is terrible, except for the cheap ice cream.  But the show was pretty neat, and he took requests.  Where else can you hear Smooth Criminal, a Star Wars medley, and Disney songs like \"Let It Go\" from Frozen all done on an organ with animated props while you dine?  My kids and husband enjoyed it for about the first 10 minutes, but were begging to leave as soon as they were done eating.  LOL.  I could have stayed for another round of tunes.  I'd certainly go back if we had visitors in town who wanted to see the spectacle.  Note: Cash only.  And it's really loud during the show.  Neat show + cheap ice cream = 3 stars."}
{"text":"So I did a search for top punk/indie bars in Mesa, and to my surprise, this was rated #13 above Cobra Arcade Bar. So out of curiosity, I took an Uber there from Cornish Pasty Co. I was kinda shocked to see a line going around the building, with people dressed for what appeared to be a punk show.   For the life of me, I was so confused. But my curiosity got the best of me, and I stuck around - one of the best shows I've ever been to. They setup a stage in front of the iconic organ, and the band was none other than The Copyrights and Something Fierce. The show was insane - all the benches and tables were pushed to the side of the room, and they started a pit where someone would normally be eating their pizza.  Such a perfect punk venue - hidden in plain sight behind the organ and the flags draped over the window. Noise ordinance be damned - this place in Mesa kicked ass."}
{"text":"This isn't a place I'd go to on a regular basis unless I had out-of-town guests.  So lately I have been going on a regular basis.  It's a really fun place to take guests, and a much bigger deal than one would think from descriptions of the establishment.    Organ Stop Pizza all about the show, not the pizza.  The 2-level eating area is quite  big, surrounding a tall stage on three sides.  When the show starts, all of a sudden a beautiful and ornate organ with a musician rises in a slow spiral from the stage. The musician is incredible, not only playing a 40 minute set of show tunes, but also managing all of the buttons and plugs to operate numerous instruments around the ceiling, along with dancing cats and a quacking duck. During this time the background and various pipes, seen through plexiglass, change colors.    Organ Stop doesn't open until 4:00, so there's often a line waiting to get in.  No worries; it goes very fast.  Some people love the pizza, others not so much.  There is a nice salad bar.  Drinks are cheapest when ordered by the pitcher, and this includes beer and soft drinks.  There are no free refills.  Ice cream is also sold.  After an intermission, the second set of music may involve patriotic songs or singalongs -- whatever the talented musician feels like playing that night. Anniversaries and birthdays are recognized. It's a lot of fun for every age."}
{"text":"They don't have places like this back home! The entertainment was great. If you're looking for a quick sit down meal, this is a good place to go with the whole family. I'm glad we stopped here."}
{"text":"I finally got to go to this place after dating my now wife.  The organ is huge!  Not sure if it s the WOrlds Largest organ.  Try the Organ at the Conference Center in Salt Lake CIty Utah.  lol  The food was good but not great.  The pizza was tasty  but a little too much cheese for me.  It is dark and you cant see the people you are sitting with as good but that s part of the atmoshpere I guess.  The organ music is loud and they play some fun tunes.  I can see where it does get repetitive."}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke.. only take cash or check... really?? Gotta order your drinks seperate and paid for separately   from your food .. no place to sit... employees are rude and not helpful with questions ...I live here in Az and brought my guests here to eat but will definetly not be back ever again nor will I be bringing out of town guests either!!"}
{"text":"1st off, the organ is incredible! It even held my teenagers attention, which is a hard task to accomplish.  The first of a couple issues are you have to pay with cash only.  If you don't have cash to pay, there is am ATM inside, that has a hefty fee. Then, after standing in line to order food, you are sent to a whole other line to stand in again... to order a soda/beer or beverage of your choice. And, you guessed it, pay cash again.  The tables are family style, so be ready to feel a bump from who sits behind you, and remember that drink? You get 1, which will go fast after having to yell to talk to your neighbors as it is very loud. The pizza is tasty, so that helps, but your on your own to order, keep track when it is ready, and go pick it up yourself as no one will help you. Good luck."}
{"text":"This place is great, mostly because of the organ, music, and friendly service. This is why I am giving 3 stars instead of 2. The music selection varies significantly ranging from songs that a appeal to children (Let It Go from Frozen) to songs older adults such as that from Sound of Music. The organ itself is grand, and the numerous other musical instruments add to the value of the show.  It is also a great place for casual family dining. There isn't a wait staff but there is staff to clear the tables once done.  However, let it be known that this restaurant's food is mediocre and the establishment itself could improve. The set-up to order food is also quite strange: you order and pay for food in one line and then go to a separate line to pay for drinks. It is also cash only which is an inconvenience for me since I rarely ever carry cash. As for the food, we ordered the pizza. It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't come back for it. The building itself looks and smells old and outdated."}
{"text":"Pretty cool pizza place. Food is good, but definitely not the best pizza I've had. The organ show is incredible though, and definitely worth the visit! Also this place is cash only!"}
{"text":"When we arrived, my husband was a little discouraged by the number of elderly people that were waiting in line to get in.  But after our experience we realized this is a great place for a break in the monotony of multi-generational family dinners.    The pizza earns 2-3 stars from me.  I'm more of a Pizza Bianco/Humble Pie/La Bocca kind of girl.  Not a big fan of the doughy, over-cheesed kind of pizza.  But, that's what they have here, so that's what we ate.  Really nothing special, but not horrible either.  Their salad bar is pretty standard; also nothing special.  We didn't try any of their sandwiches or specialty dishes.  However, the entertainment was unlike anything I've ever seen before, and we all really enjoyed it.  The organ pipes are quite a spectacle: a countless number of them, two stories high, all throughout the dining hall.  There are drums and bongos on the walls and bells and xylophones hanging from the ceiling.  The organ itself rotates on a platform at the front and center of the dining hall.  I bet your organ doesn't do that.  (On that note, I'll inform you that the \"giant organ\" and \"huge pipes\" lend themselves to a number of inappropriate jokes.  So, have fun with that!)  Being the holiday season, we heard a lot of Christmas music both familiar and unfamiliar.  My stepdaughter was elated when they played her current theme song, \"All I want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth.\"  And all of the kids loved the \"It's a Small World/Mickey Mouse Club\" theme song medley with the banner of Mickey hanging from the ceiling and \"Under the Sea\" with blue lights on the disco ball and bubbles at the end.  Personally, I was a fan of the Phantom of the Opera medley.    The organist has a request box at the front of the stage that he checks every so often and he recognizes birthdays and special occasions and plays songs for them.    We're looking forward to doing another family dinner here sometime. Between grandma, adult kids and grandkids (ages 1-7), our gang had a really good time here!"}
{"text":"Warning....the food is not good. Peter piper pizza is better and that's not saying much. That being said, you don't come here for pizza. It's all about the nostalgic organ music. It's a great time with friends and family. They only take cash, so pull some out before you come. Check the website. Often times, there are deals that are going on. You definitely have to come check it out if you live close by."}
{"text":"WAIT! STOP! Do NOT go here for the Pizza!  Will it kill you? I think your life is more at risk by walking through the parking lot during the snowbird season. The pizza is passable, but you do not go to Organ stop for the pizza.  To enjoy Organ Stop, you must be a music lover. I mean the band geek variety. I was lucky enough to get my father here before he passed away, and every time I go since I reminisce in his enjoyment, in my parents enjoyment of a wide variety of music.  For the uninitiated, the location at 1149 East Southern Avenue in Mesa is built to house a Wurlitzer Organ (OK Mike, try, try to avoid the huge organ jokes) with over 6,000 pipes. Additionally, percussive and horn instruments are tied to the instrument, not to mention the dancing cats, singing birds, disco ball and bubble machines. Keep in mind, one person operates this thing. I know they do have the ability to sample and replay the different overlays, but it's still very impressive stuff. I've seen three or four musicians in my many visits, my personal favorite in Charlie Balough.  The crowd varies between kiddie and senior, and can be especially senior during snowbird season. After it warms up a bit, it's much easier to get in, sit down, eat mediocre pizza and drink a pitcher of beer while you list to an artist play a wide assortment of musical selections.   I've been there many, many times, and it's a consistent experience. Enjoy yourself and teach your kids to appreciate music."}
{"text":"Organ Stop Pizza is unique. The obvious big draw to this place is the massive organ and the very talented organist. Truly impressive and charming. While we were there he played several songs, all from different genres. My very busy bodied 7-year-old was very entertained.   When you first enter the restaurant you go up to the counter to order. We ordered a simple pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. We also ordered a \"small salad\" which is salad bar style, but there are several signs up that ask that you only take one trip to the salad bar. Lame. And again, seems like cheap skate business to me. Then when we went to pay, found out that they take CASH ONLY -No debit or credit cards. This is such a pet peeve of mine. It is 2014. Who carries cash anymore?! Add $0.05 to each item to cover the costs of having a credit card machine and call it good. Quit being ridiculous! They do have an ATM in the restaurant so, we quickly got cash out and then went to order our drinks....which are down the side of the counter and you pay separately for as well.  Again, annoying. Why are the multiple stations necessary??   The dinning area is seat yourself and we found a nice little spot in the corner. It was very busy but we could still see pretty well. You are given a number on your receipt and the numbers go up on a big board in the dinning area, similar to a bingo board. Our pizza was ready pretty quickly but, the food was mediocre, at best, and very overpriced for what we got. For the large pizza, two small salads, and two sodas- it was just over $40. For a dinner out, that is pretty typical for that kind of order but, again- I was annoyed by the lack of service and inconveniences, and when I go out to eat, I want the food to be fantastic...this wasn't.  I would however, highly recommend checking this place out AFTER having dinner somewhere else. Then get some cash out, come in, get some drinks and enjoy the organ for a few hours."}
{"text":"Stay with me, this might get confusing for ya, my daughter (3rd oldest) was in town for the weekend for a visit and my other daughter (2nd oldest) said we should go somewhere where it doesn't matter how loud the kids get, where it's fun and entertains them and allow us to visit and for others to join us, I told her I had my fill of Peter Piper Pizza for the year not going there, she said Mom lets go to Organ Stop Pizza, I laughed, no really I laughed, Organ Stop has never been on my list of places to go and its sort of a running joke on YT,  my daughter then told me that she has been before and my grandson loves it.  Come to find out, most of my kids (have 4 total and not so much on the kid side anymore ranging frm 22 to 17) have been to Organ Stop and do enjoy it. (I fully believe they live a secret life when my eyes were closed, I thought they were out running the streets, but nope it was hanging out at Organ Stop haha) So Organ Stop Pizza was the place picked, time to meet up was a Friday night at 6:30pm. Off we went  We got there a little before 6:30 because wanted to make sure to get tables and set up for everyone, and damn the parking lot is FULL, Yep I was shocked! Didn't know it was such a hot spot to go to.  Prior to coming my (2nd oldest) daughter told me to find tables on the 1st floor (1st floor??? WTH this is a pizza joint right??? 2 floors?) And after walking in I saw what she meant. When you 1st walk in you are facing the menu board to order pizza, I'll get back to that, but if you go to your right you will see the dining room, and low and behold it has 2 floors of seating. 1st floor was completely filled up, so I went upstairs and found us 2 long tables.  Then I stopped and really looked around. 1st observation, DAMN THAT'S A HUGE ORGAN, and not so much a HUGE ORGAN, it's the pipes, they are in the walls, and all over, is this a sound proof building? Can you hear it on the street??  2nd, this must have been an old church, that's the feeling it gives from the 2 floors and seating arrangements.   I have to say hearing scores of the Phantom of the Opera played on that bad ass organ sounded amazing and the light show that went with it, I liked it.   Ok like I said when you 1st walk in you are faced with ordering your pizza. This is where the place loses points, it's all scattered. In one place you order your pizza and pay for it, then get into another line, order your salad and pay for it, then get into another line for drinks and pay for it.  Why can't it be one stop shopping experience?  Oh and everything is CASH ONLY.  I ordered 1 large Hawaiian, 1 Large Combination, 1 medium Spicy Italian for 54 bucks, then ordered 3 pitchers of soda (MT Dew, Root beer, Sierra Mist) for 15 bucks. I tried the Hawaiian & Combination, the Hawaiian had chopped ham throughout the pizza and good amount of pineapple, the combo pizza wasn't lacking the bell peppers, for that's all I remember from it, but the pizza itself was not that great, it's like Little Creasers pizza but with a car dealership sticker price.   Do I feel like I got my money's worth? No not really, but what I did get was a meal with all 4 of my kids, 3 of my grandkids, tons of family and friends, some laughter and smiles, and that right there is what counts.   Return factor though is really low."}
{"text":"First time here. I must say this was such a fun place to eat and enjoy some awesome music. The pizza I ordered was huge and delicious! Def a family environment or if you have company in town and want to take them to a fun restaurant. The organ player was awesome and he played so many songs without sheet music."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It was worth the 28 minutes to get here. The food was ok. Very much like a grownup Chuck e Cheese. You order your food and drinks at the counter. Decor has not changed since the 80s. The arcade was very old and run down. Lots of families and older folks. I've lived here my whole life! How did I not know about this place. So kitschy and fun! The organist is incredibly talented. My 4 year old thought the music was too loud. I would come back here!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place for many years and never really knew what it was until a friend suggested we go there for dinner with the kids. I reluctantly agreed, as I didn't think it would be anything my kids would be interested in.  GOOD: Awesome set up with the organ and all the musical equiptment. The organ player was excellent and very personable. The disco ball and bubbles that they blow during certain songs was a nice touch.  BAD: The line to get in was rediculiously long. They only accept cash. You have to pay for your drinks seperately. There was nowhere to sit. The prices are way to high. The pizza tastes like microwave pizza. The food took forever and they weren't very clear when you ordered how to know when it's ready... they hand you a number and tell you to wait. The numbers go in no particular order so you have to pay attention. Half the games in the game room were out of order and took your money.  All in all it was an experience that I am glad I had but not glad enough to go again. Oh and my kids couldn't have cared less about the organ, just as I suspected."}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of friends and family, never saw an organ that large attached to other playing music instruments...pretty neat. The food was mediocre, ordered a couple of pizzas(it was so so), fried mushrooms, fried zucchini and onion rings. Nothing really to crave about, good spot to go to for first time visitors."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and we did so for a friend's birthday party. I am giving this four stars because the experience was fun and unique. The music would play for awhile at a time which is fine just not what your used to I guess when you are accustom to talking with your party. The food was as expected upon arriving there and seeing the photos online. It makes sense with how this is a family establishment and pack a lot of ppl in there. It was good for Peter Piper like pizza but I am a food snob so I want better but as I am putting four stars I did not really have a complaint."}
{"text":"A fantastic place to take the family.  A unique opportunity that takes you back in time.  It is must for the family."}
{"text":"First time here.  The entertainment is wonderful, well worth seeing.  The pizza is good.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Organ Stop is a fun family friendly pizza place. There is a lot of seating however you do need to get there early. They open at 4. We got there around 4:30 and the only table available was in the very front to the far left which isn't the best viewing area (probably why that was the table left).   The food is probably 3 stars, the pizza was just okay and the salad bar is small but nice. It does cost over $3 for a small one trip plate. These are defiantly small plates, I am not a huge salad water but it was very difficult to fit much of anything on the plate.   I do not know if I like that the drinks are separate from the food ordering. I'm sure it cuts down on the time spent in line ordering drinks, but then you are waiting in a second line, almost equally as long waiting to order your drinks. If you have multiple people with you, I suggest agreeing on one type of pop and getting a pitcher, much cheaper that way.   I bumped this up a star from the food for the entertainment. The man playing the organ was great, very entertaining. Even had my 2 year old on his feet giving standing ovations (even when he wasn't feeling good)."}
{"text":"Charlie Balogh might be the most talented musician ive seen in years.. he is truly amazing and really blew me away with each song he played. Should be on Broadway!! Oh and the zucchin sticks here and mushrooms were yummy as heck!!"}
{"text":"What a great time!  Talented musicians, great entertainment, fun for any age, and I mean ANY age.  Good food and nice people!"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was really tasty, and the Wurtlitzer (and the organist) was amazing. Such a fun experience!"}
{"text":"Come for the music, stay for the pizza.  I guess I'm in the minority, but I really like their pizza. Their cooking system yields a very crispy layer on the bottom of an otherwise fluffy crust as opposed to some pizzas that have a more soggy, chewy crust.  I also ordered the combo appetizer, fried mushrooms, zucchini, and mozzarella sticks. Loved the mushrooms and zucchini.  The CASH ONLY policy might be a problem if you aren't prepared.  As for the music... It is loud and I think there's a canned set list (with a few requests thrown in, I asked for \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" and he played it straight (no embellishments). Alas it totally killed the festive mood in the room. Sorry. I enjoyed it.  It's not a place I'd go to frequently, but I'd return occasionally for the pizza and zucchini and see if he'd take my odd requests. I see in another review that he did \"Stairway to Heaven.\" I wonder if he would do \"Bohemian Rhapsody?\""}
{"text":"Having grown up in Mesa, I've been here many, many times. The last time I was here was 15 years ago when I was in high school. Tonight I brought my husband and kids.  The place literally has not changed in all these years. It's crazy! Like a time capsule! These lose a star for me because of their totally antiquated POS system (ok it's not even that, it's a manual old school cash register). It's CASH ONLY. I mean seriously? Also, you have order your pizza in one line and get your drinks in another line, and pay separately. It makes absolutely no sense!  They also lose a star because the pizza is terrible. I mean just awful.  Ok now that the gripes are out of the way...we had a blast! My kids were all smiles, laughing and dancing the whole time. They were fascinated the the huge organ and all the bells and whistles. The dancing cats, the bubbles, the lights! The kids LOVED it! The organist was really good. He played a stunning version of Phantom of the Opera that I loved.  We got the kids ice cream which was only $2 each. Not bad.  Bottom line the entertainment is great, the venue is very casual and super family friendly. It's a great time with the fam. But maybe I'll just get a salad next time."}
{"text":"Fun experience for kids and pretty cool to see for the musically-inclined (if not but for the first 10-15 mins or so).  The pizza was average - on par w/Chuck E Cheese - and the penny pinching was more than obvious.  They charge way more than expected to add a salad bar to your order and strictly allow one visit - it's sort of like a grumpy cafeteria lady is running shop or something.    I will say the organist and the instrument is impressive.  But seriously - the arcade is embarrassing and stole like half of my kids quarters on non-functional old arcade games ($1.00 to play a game that's probably 20 years old now?  Really!  $.50 for Cruisin USA!  Like a bad joke that sucks in 5 year olds)."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on a Monday night with my cousin and boyfriend before flying out of Phoenix.   We shared a large combination pizza, onion ring app, and a pitcher of Miller (pitcher was only ~$7!). Food was okay, but the star was the live organ playing. It was so impressive I cannot even begin to fully describe it. The organ pipes and everything took up an entire wall of the place, with additional sound/visual effects lining the ceiling and interior. It was so cool listening to Phantom of the Opera, Mamma Mia, etc.  The crowd was mainly older folks and families with children. Although there are signs that tell parents to make sure their children don't run around everywhere, many parents seemed to ignore that. Children were running everywhere, up and down stairs, and screaming. This was the only thing that detracted from our experience.  Otherwise, this was definitely a very cool, unique place to go to. If my parents ever go to Phoenix, I would recommend them stopping by this place!"}
{"text":"This place gets suuuuper busy around dinner time, but it made it really enjoyable to eat here at the same time!  I do wish they had some line control at the entrance though; you had a very long line out the door to order (to go?), and another side where people were exiting, and another of people trying to go in to find a table to sit at... it was a huge cluster---- around the doors!  But once you're inside it really opens up, the entire building is one giant organ - every instrument you see on the wall is used when a song is being played! It gets pretty loud in here, and I did find myself shouting a bit over the crowd noise, but overall I didn't find it annoying, just part of the fun :)  The pizza was SO good, crispy underside, yummy mozzarella cheese... I'm literally drooling thinking about this pizza again!! Unfortunately I didn't get the chance to try their ice cream, but next time for sure I will!  I would highly suggest sending a family member into the building to save a table spot while the other orders if it's your first time here because it can get pretty hectic in there! I love sitting on the second level because you get a really good overview of the organist and the instruments working."}
{"text":"I love Organ stop pizza, just not for the PIZZA. You have to visit at least once to see the organist and the pipes and instruments playing. Organ stop boasts the world's largest Wurlitzer Organ, and its spectacular presence is worth the trip alone.   It's a great place to take out of towners! It also appears to be a great place to take young and old and has a birthday party atmosphere. The food could be better! We tried the pizza twice and it's just ok.  They take song requests and they do their best to play a variety of songs. Worth a first and second visit! They do have salad and ice cream as well but bring cash or checks because they do not take credit cards. Also check the hours before you go because they are not open all day."}
{"text":"Came here once for the experience and will never come back. It was cool but like, so divey and gross and you're not even getting quality food or service so once was enough for me. Cash only. Pizza is very mediocre. I'd rather eat dominoes or even a frozen digiorno. Drinks are separate and no free refills and no Coke products. Ha sorry I'm a Coke girl!!!!! Fun place for kids I guess. The organ is the only cool thing about it. Really fun to watch. It's loud too FYI."}
{"text":"Organ Stop Pizza is a must for those who have never been, and for those visiting from out of town. You don't need me to tell you that, since you will undoubtedly be smacked in the face with elderly folks and oxygen tanks. Sometimes even tour buses full drop off. I suggest off-season visits. Parking can be atrocious,  bit at least it's free.  The vintage organ is visible both from the exterior and interior. The organist rises from the floor in a spectacular display. He takes requests and passes birthday, anniversary and other special messages. It really is a sight. Be prepared that it is really loud. Don't expect any semblance of conversation here. If I put my mouth directly near you ear,  I bet you couldn't hear me.  The pizza and accoutrement is substandard. This is about the organ and the novelty really, with a side of pizza. The young counter staff is mostly disinterested. Ordering is weird because pizza is separate from drinks, which is separate from ice cream. Really kind of a poorly thought out set up. Also be aware that when your order is ready, the light flashes your number on a Keno-style board on each side of the room, toward the balcony area. They don't explain it, so people get confused.  If you get weirded out by picnic table, family-style seating, know that this is what seating is here. At times it is really hard to find a table, even on the upper balcony. Have family find a table before you get the food to alleviate some seat - finding stress. The tables have been varnished a million and a half times,  so combined with the food residue,  it's always sticky.  But that said, even if you are a local and have never been, it is a spectacle that you must see at least once. Strike that. Not AT LEAST ONCE,  ONLY ONCE. It's a one and done. Trust me."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to go! It's so fun and exciting! Best for birthday parties and anniversary's! The organ and music is my favorite part of going here! It's so amazing and fantastic.   This is definitely a must! They have really good fresh pizza and salads!   Personally, music is my favorite in the world and this place makes me happy! Great job Organ Stop Pizza!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for the family! I love that they take music requests as you eat. The puppets, drums, and lights add to the organ experience! Wish it was a little less crowded and more organized (perhaps reservations)."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place! Up front: CASH ONLY & You don't just come looking for good pizza, that's not really the point of it as stated in other reviews. It's for the amazing organ and music you'll be entertained by as you eat. World famous organist come here to play for you and it does not disappoint, the organ is basically the entire building, there are pipes EVERYWHERE! It's gorgeous, it blew my mind. I've never been somewhere like this before. Bubbles came from the ceiling when the organist played the little mermaid!! Great spot for birthday parties no matter what the age, and the pizza isn't bad, it was actually pretty good! It's not gourmet, and the vibe when you walk in is almost Chuck E. Cheese but once you get to the seating area (it's family style, long tables take a seat!) that completely changes and you're focused on who is playing the organ. Lights around the room change colors to the songs! So glad my boyfriend brought me here, we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of the Organ Grinder Pizza that used to be in Portland, OR. Food is good, Pizza and appetizers.  Service is pretty fast because when we were there they were pumping through masses of people.  The entertainment, if you like Organ playing is tremendous the organist is very talented.  An enjoyable dinner evening for the family!"}
{"text":"Unique experience you won't forget!  If you're coming here for the pizza alone, don't.  If you're coming for a fun time, then come. The organists are very talented, and fun to watch.  We got the small salad bar and it was plenty, with the pizza. Not sure if I would return, but for a one and done fun time for the kids, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Music is fun, played Gonna Fly Now from Rocky perfectly for my sons birthday. The pizza is average Arizona fast food pizza, not good not bad definitely worth checking this place out for its originality."}
{"text":"I feel like Organ Stop is a place you come to to enjoy the organ, not so much the pizza. (I don't write bad reviews, so I'll keep it about the organ.) The organist plays a variety of tunes! There is a request jar near him and most of the time he plays all of the songs! It's fun trying to guess the songs and looking around to see all the little instruments on the walls move."}
{"text":"Way cool!!! Not just your normal pizza place!! The pizza is awesome but the organ is over the top!! This is a must stop if your in the state of Arizona!!"}
{"text":"The music is so cool! The organ players take requests which is especially nice for birthdays. The organ pipes surround the whole dining room which is two levels. With special songs they even release bubbles like with \"under the sea\". This is a great place to take kids! Pizzas are pretty good but nothing too special. They also have beer and a salad bar. Oh and take cash because they don't accept cards!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal music! It's similar to attending a live concert (with only one human). He an amazing genius.  Pizza is pretty good and fantastic atmosphere.   Downside: The sub sandwich did not meet my expectation (small), and there are no drink refills besides coffee. And cash only (bring at least $15/person).   Have to come here at least once."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this place. We haven't been in over a decade. When we came, the place felt updated, unlike some other entertainment eatery's. The LED upgrade is The pizza has an airy feel to where you can devour the first slice and move on to another slice with ease!, LOL! The ordering process is really cool too. You order the pizza in one area and the beverages in another."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay but I go there for the ATMOSPHERE!!! I have been going here since I was little!! They only take cash but they do have an ATM. There is also a game room and instruments all over that the Organ plays! We love the songs that use the cat puppets."}
{"text":"Organ Stop Pizza is truly a family oriented establishment.  Long, large tables end-to-end everywhere, and (2) stories to boot.  The pizza was better than expected - traditional, not greasy, plenty of toppings built out so that there isn't even a bone.  Our group which had ages 1-60+, didn't have a single complaint and we had over (10) pies served of varying types.  Above all else, the music is great.  I've never experienced anything like this, and if you enjoy good wholesome family fun, I highly recommend Organ Stop Pizza."}
{"text":"If you've read any of these reviews, I'm sure you see the recurring theme- you come here for the experience...certainly not for the food or service.  One star for the organ- it's truly a thing of beauty. You should wander upstairs while you're there so you can get the full effect. The second star is for the the people who play the organ. They are EXTREMELY talented. When I watch them play, I'm totally in awe.  Sadly, two stars is the highest I can rate Organ Stop. This is a great place to take out of town guests, kids, or winter visitors. Just don't expect to be wow'ed by anything other than the music. Pizza is not so great, service is just ok, and cash only? Seriously? Plus the way you order is a mess. I wish Organ Stop would make a few updates to make the experience better but since they can make loads of money without changing a thing, I won't hold my breath."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Organ Stop Pizza since I was a kid with my family. The organ music and atmosphere are unique and enjoyable, and I love coming now for those reasons...but the food....not so great. The pizza isn't anything special, not much better than a $5 frozen pizza, and the salad bar is lacking. If they stepped it up on the quality of the food I would probably eat here more often. 2 stars for the awesome entertainment."}
{"text":"Went to the Phoenix one as a kid. This one doesn't disappoint.... super busy even on a weeknight....the organ seems like it tripled in size! The organ player took time after to tell us how it worked and the specifications ....it moves 55,000 cubic feet of air per minute.......Food was good and prices were very affordable... coming back for sure since the kids were amazed for hours."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant/entertainment venue in the United States. I can't explain it to you, you'll just have to check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Five stars for the memory. (hope you all enjoy it) When I was a kid we went here as a family all the time, but one time when I was a baby the organ came out and started playing and I almost bit my moms boob (other parts but keeping this pg for the kids) right off. No matter how many times we go back, nothing will ever get my family to stop telling that story. Lol.  Pizza is decent, and service has always been ok, although I haven't been there in quite some time!"}
{"text":"Very cute place to take your family. Naturally the world's largest Wurlitzer is the main attraction and it definitely entertains. I've never seen a theater organ that controls so many different instruments. It's quite a show. Definitely suggest to do at least once in your life. It's a totally unique experience. The food is nothing to rave about, but if you're looking for fantastic pizza, you probably already have your go-to local pizza parlor in mind."}
{"text":"Really thrilled that I finally made it out to this place after over a year of knowing about it.  I really was organly blown away by what is the coolest pizza themed joint anywhere.  I love organs and it was simply fantastic to hear all the songs on this instrument housed in the skeleton of the building.  The pizza itself was just okay to me, but they have Blue Bell ice cream to make up for that!  And of course... the great promise of your favorite contemporary song being played on the organ.  Family fun, birthday fun...its organzmic!"}
{"text":"Great place to come hang out & listen to music played on the organ! Especially during Christmas time!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, fun atmosphere!  It does get crowded so expect a little wait."}
{"text":"This place was pretty entertaining!! The music varied including soundtrack hits from star wars and frozen. Pizza was alright, but crust not very good.  For two people it would be about $15 for a medium two topping pizza. Drinks are a bit pricey so I'll stick with water. Looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"I ate here once for a retirement dinner for a friend, and once was enough.  The place was nasty dirty, the tables (that you eat on....) were the worst.  The pizza was pretty bad ( Eatza Pizza, Ci Cis, etc level) and to be honest I have had frozen pizzas that were better.  I find it disheartening that so many people rate this place based completely on the novelty, as I would rather have great food in a bland place then horrible food in a dirty place with a gimmick.   With all the diverse places and interesting food choices we have in this city, paying for really bad overpriced pizza in a place that they don't even bother to clean is silly - even if they do have a Organ.  And they only take cash? Seriously? My landscape guy even has a credit card machine in his truck, so why can't this place accept debit/credit?  Bottom line, ignore the novelty - if you want pizza go to Spinatos or Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"We received a gift certificate for Christmas and just recently decided to cash them in. This place is certainly unique and was a great dinner experience.  I expected the food to be subpar since the focus was on the entertainment but I was pleasantly surprised - the pizza was great!  The performance was fascinating. I don't know why it took us this long to go.  The two-line system is a bit weird, but the lines did move quickly.  Cash only, so make sure to hit the ATM before you go."}
{"text":"One of the fun places to eat pizza with the whole family. I have been coming here for many years now. Before the place opened I was able to get a grand tour of the whole background. It is absolutely unreal how much work they put into this place and how many gadgets and gizmos there are to create such entertainment. The musicians are amazing and I yet to hear a song they cannot play on the Organ and I love requesting certain songs for them to play. They have a ton of different sounds and instruments being played throughout the whole entire facility as well as many lights flashing all around you while you eat. Reminds me a little of Disneyland. Speaking of Disneyland I highly recommend a request for the great Musicians to play any Disney song you desire. Besides the entertainment, the food and especially the pizza taste completely different from anything you'll ever taste. I have tried pizza from all over and the thing I look for in all kinds of food is how different the food tastes. I want to make sure that I'm eating at a place where I cannot find a sequel to the taste and that's how I rate and everything that I eat. Whether somebody likes the place or not is their opinion because taste is always within the tongue of the beholder. Customer service is awesome here as well and I have never met any rude workers here as well. It's a great place to have a party it's a great place to bring your friends and family. It is on a cash only basis though so make sure you do bring your dollar bills and it is a dinner place so they usually open later so don't expect to go to lunch here. Make sure you check out this place and tell the managers Andrew Daniel from yelp sent you."}
{"text":"Always a great time when we come. Brought my mother in law this time. $35 for 3 pizza and two pitchers of soda and show well worth it. We heard phantom of the opera, Star Wars, Disney, and many more classic tunes. We can't recommend this place enough and can't wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"If you want to have a nice conversation over dinner, this is not the place to go.  If you are looking for quality pizza, this is not the place to go.  If you are looking for a place with some very unique entertainment to accompany some not-so-great pizza, than this is the place to go.  I love the entertainment.  The restaurant is built around the largest Wurlitzer theater pipe organ in the world (Almost 6,000 Pipes!). The organ controls violins, drums, horns, xylophones, and many other special effects hanging on the walls of the restaurant.  The music is a lot of fun. The organist plays movie scores, TV theme songs, Disney songs, Broadway hits, patriotic songs, and even takes requests!  Don't expect to be able to have a normal conversation since the noise is high volume.  The food is nothing special, so don't go expecting that and you won't leave disappointed.    Thanksgiving through Mid-April: Sunday - Thursday 4pm-9pm Friday - Saturday 4pm-10pm  Mid-April through Thanksgiving: Sunday - Thursday 5pm-9pm Friday - Saturday 5pm-10pm"}
{"text":"OMG pizza is amazing by far the best pizza I've had hands down! Can't always go cause it's loud but defiantly family oriented, the atmospheres is really nice and everyone is friends HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"They don't accept cards. Debit or credit. Who doesn't accept cards now a days? So stupid. Pizza was mediocre. Would not come back"}
{"text":"I took the kids here today; 9, 12 & 16 and they LOVED it!! This isn't a gourmet dining spot so if that's what you are looking, keep looking. I think the old cash registers, the different lines & old school salad bar give it a fun, eclectic feel! The kids enjoyed watching for their number, requesting songs, and signing along to the songs. The also loved the bench seating and the overall atmosphere. We all thought the pizza was pretty good and had no complaints. I would definitely bring them back here!"}
{"text":"The pizza is just good but that's not why you should come here. The entertainment is unlike anything esle in the Valley. Anytime we have out of town guests, we alwasy suggest Organ Stop and no one has yet to be dissapointed. Good for adults and kids alike."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to bring my parents here this past week after raving about it for more than a year. I inherited my dad's affinity for all things old and obscure, coin-operated player pianos and massive pipe organs among them. It was such a treat to see the look on his face while Lew Williams rocked the Mighty Wurlitzer.   We arrived to find a line going out the door (mostly senior citizens), but decided to tough it out. While waiting I ran into the main dining room, plucked one of the request cards, quickly wrote out \"The Raiders of the Lost Ark theme song\" before dropping it in the box and returning to our party.   I swear my dad nearly cried tears of pride and joy a few times, smiling broadly as we ate our amazingly savory large Combination (pepperoni, ham, bacon, sausage, beef, mushroom, olives, green pepper, onion) pizzas as we watched/listened to Lew playing.   It took a couple sets before Lew got to my request, but he played it at the very beginning of one before leading into a \"Star Wars\" medley, followed by the 1960s theme song to the \"Star Trek.\" Indy has just always been near and dear to my family.   Someone recorded a previous performance (done by Charlie) and posted it on YouTube: http://youtu.be/Kh6HwkK2G7g  I do warn you, though, people can be extremely pushy when it comes to getting a table (since it's cafeteria-like seating) and sometimes they don't really care about the entertainment or common courtesy, either talking loudly over the music or standing in front of you while you're trying to watch.   Don't get down about it, though. Chances are they'll leave right after a set and won't sit through the short break. In the mean time, enjoy the music!"}
{"text":"Well do not come here looking for good food... cause you aren't going to find it.  The pizza is no better than frozen and the salad bar leaves something to be desired.  Oddly enough... the onions rings were pretty good!    But the organ part of the evening makes up for what the food lacks.  It's quite the atmosphere.  The organ is amazing and it's fun to sing along and make requests!!"}
{"text":"well its like this....very incredibly hokey, but really cool. I could picture this in pigeon forge or branson but it really is worth seeing. Pizza is OK (nothing Special) salad bar and Ice cream are also available...Amazing Pipe Organ+++ lots of extras...we drank several pitchers of beer"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Fun fun time. Spectacular music!  A must for visitors!!!  Have been here before and will come again. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"So when a work holiday party gets scheduled at Organ Stop Pizza several things may come to your mind:  1. A funky pizza place that caters to the very young and the very old for a work function? Interesting. 2. Does this place deserve its Yelp Talk infamy? 3. Will Organ Stop Pizza make good on their title and make my organs stop when I eat their pizza?  There's so much cheesiness here and I'm not talking about the pizza! When there's flashing technicolor lights, a gigantic blingy overhead disco ball, and coordinated dancing cats wearing hats that bop to the beat of the pipe organ playing Chim Chim Cher-ee while said organ rotates around and around, what more could you ask for in a dining experience?   This humble restaurant is the \"Home of the mighty Wurlitzer\", an impressive looking pipe organ that dates back to the Roaring Twenties. The entire restaurant was rented out for us and we had an array of all you can eat salad, soda, pizza, and ice cream. The salad bar had all your standard dressings with an iceberg lettuce mix. The pizza was decent. It had a lightly crisp crust and puffy soft dough. It tasted about what you'd expect for a pizza buffet.  There were a lot of kids here since families were invited to the shindig, and they all seemed to enjoy the limitless pizza, soda and ice cream.   The star of the show is of course the pipe organ and organ player. Our organ player was Lew Williams who did an admirable job playing various songs by memory and even took requests from the audience. He played Christmas songs, a lot of Mary Poppins songs, some Disney, and the obligatory Phantom of the Opera numbers.   I wasn't really expecting that much from here but it was a decent experience. If you're looking for something that's definitely unique with a kitschy vibe, Organ Stop is your stop."}
{"text":"Organ player was amazing! He took requests and he is front and center so you can watch his talent. The food wasn't anything special...although the entire time we were there there was a line out the door and the staff were continuously working hard and being so timely with the food. Pizza was nice and hot. Other than that, it's a cafeteria feel, long benches, open seating."}
{"text":"Fun place. Menu is typical pizza joint, but the live organ music sets this gem apart from the rest."}
{"text":"The pizza is ok. But the music lights and ambience is why you go! Try the fried zucchini and don't forget ice cream.  We usually celebrate my Mom's birthday there every year.  They do the Birthday Song better than anyone else.  Bring cash they do not except credit or debit cards.  Dinner hours only.  A great family place!  Can accommodate large groups."}
{"text":"The sounds of the organ made my son have the best time. At 2 years old it was non stop head bopping and body shaking. It was an excellent time for him. Pizza was good but to see the smile on my sons face when listening to the organ made the night. This is an excellent place for a family fun night out. Just remember Thames don't take debit/credit but there is an ATM with a $2.50 service charge."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 5!  It is amazing and it's not just the organ, it's also the pizza.  The pizza has definitely improved since we first visited several years ago.  We enjoyed visiting with friends and the organ.  Lights were everywhere.  Even the puppets came out to dance with the music.  Amazing for sure.  We ordered an Hawaiian pizza.  It was loaded with toppings and absolutely excellent.  We will definitely plan on taking other friends next time we visit.  That will be soon."}
{"text":"I love the cheese on their pizza. The salad bar is good, but I am a picky guy so maybe that's why. The best part of this whole place is their amazing organ artists. They place such amazing music and operate an astronomically elaborate machine!  The sounds rock!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my daughters 3rd birthday here! We reserved a table for 20 on the main floor near the organ. The kids loved the music and lights! They danced they're little hearts out!! The adults were entertained as well, many had never been before.  They had a good mix of kid songs and adult ones. And of course they played happy birthday :) We ordered a couple pizzas and salads plates. I thought the combo pizza was yummy. We also purchased ice cream later and we were all happy with the flavor choices. It is annoying that they don't take debit cards but because we knew in advance it wasn't that much of an inconvenience.  A couple guests wanting to purchase more beer did complain though about having to use the atm. This month they are doing a Christmas in July event. The main room was decorated with Christmas trees and they played some Christmas songs. Because we were there on Saturday they had Santa clause there too."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 2.75/5 Happiness - 5/5  Went here with the family after a Cubs spring training game and it was a great capstone to the night. Besides the pizza, the food isn't great. We got the appetizer platter and none of it tasted particularly good (i.e., fried mushrooms, fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks). The pizza is tasty enough, in the same tier as Papa Johns. They have an ice cream bar that is about equal to Baskin Robbins. They also offered pasta, which looked pretty good (but probably is just ok based on the other food).  But let's be honest, you come here for the show. And what a show it is. The room vibrates. People sing along. Puppets and disco balls! And quite simply, you have never seen an organ like this. There is also a small arcade if that's up your alley. They also appear to host holiday buffets, which would probably be a lot of fun in a big group.   The staff is also incredibly well-mannered - a bit surprising since they all appear to be teenagers. It's a fun place, it makes you feel happy, and it will stick out in your memory. To echo many other reviewers BRING CASH, NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED. I grimaced as I had to pay the service fee on their ATM."}
{"text":"It is true that the pizza isn't any good.  the music is fun and the kids have a blast.  i never go during snowbird season.  i have found that the organ guy keeps playing the same tunes over and over again.  i think i went one time during disney week, cause that is all we heard.  i request Boston's Walk On everytime and can't get them to play it, but the mission impossible theme song is always a cool his."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's great to go out with friends and family with their kids and see the happiness of the children as they watch the show. I always get excited when my favorite part, the dancing cats,  come out.  The only thing I hate is that it is cash only.  To not accept credit cards is ridiculous.  I hardly ever carry cash so it is really inconvenient."}
{"text":"I lived here 20 years ago and in the many times I have been back as a tourist, we never visited this place. Thank goodness we finally gave this place a shot. We were looking for something 'different' that would be entertaining for the whole family and don't involve a mouse and tokens. Organ Stop Pizza did not disappoint. We went on a Friday night and had no problem finding a table for our group of 7. For $$35, we had a large pizza, mozzarella sticks, garlic bread and 2 salads. This was more than enough food for our group.  The organist was outstanding and everyone enjoyed the songs. This place was so cool. If you haven't been, you must check it out."}
{"text":"A truly unique dining experience! A must for any music lover!  I celebrated my mom's birthday with family and friends. The pizza we had was good. The salad bar was fresh. The ice cream for dessert was premium.  The highlight, of course, was the music. The organist has the capability to play anything. I am sure there are exceptions, but he handled many of the requests we submitted and played music I would have not thought possible with the organ. He played big band music, Broadway musicals, movie music including Disney songs and symphony music, as well as some pop songs (Michael Jackson's Thriller). Music included lights, a cat puppet show for the song \"Alley Cat\", and even bubbles for \"Under the Sea\".  Conversation was difficult during the music show, but that's to be expected and did not detract from our enjoyment.  All food/drink purchases are cash/debit only. There is a gift shop with t-shirts, CDs, etc. as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the most amazing places to take the kids for pizza with entertainment!  The Worletzer Organ is a true work of art.  The pizza is perfect and the organ show should make everyone happy."}
{"text":"It is fun. Im sure a must try when visiting or looking for something to do or a place to eat.   The food was decent. It was really packed and hard to find a spot to sit. Fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"The pizza is ok, but nothing special. The big draw is the organ, of course! Organ Stop is a great place for having a fun evening with a group. I went last night with my girlfriend and her family, and we had a blast!  Definitely go early, as this place fills up fast! (Same with tune requests & birthday announcements. Get em in early.)  The crowd is quite diverse. Little kids having birthdays are quite common, as are those from the 75+ crowd."}
{"text":"First timer. Don't know if I can say enough. I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere. The organ player was very good. I thought the pizza was pretty good for Arizona pizza. More fun watching kids enjoy them selves. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wait staff at the front counter were awful! Not kid friendly in menu choices @ drink counter. Only accepts cash or checks, does not take debit / credit cards. Pizza is below average & over priced.  Caters to white-headed senior snowbirds.  The organ is the obvious highlight.  Stay away during snowbird season or if tour bus is in the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with fresh ingredients. Seriously - we all liked it, and we've had pizza all over the country, including New Haven, CT and Chicago, so we know what we're talking about.  AND... the largest Wurlitzer organ in the world played live by a team of experts, one of which has been taking requests and playing favorite pieces there since the 1970s. Loud, fun, family place with long family-style tables, but with so many seats and such a big staff that you can find a seat and get your food right away. We heard everything from Michael Jackson'sThriller\" to 1930s jazz ballads, complete with light show (no extra charge for the music). Pay with cash or check only. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"If you are into sitting inside of a giant pipe organ while being pounded with renditions of every show tune, movie soundtrack, patriotic song, service song or favorite from the past century, then this is the place for you.  You don't even need your hearing aids.  Biggest organ in the world, only two dozen people on the planet capable of playing it, has every instrument sound known to mankind (and then some) and the organist takes requests.  This place seems to be a favorite with the elderly crowd for the reasons stated.  For me it was loud.  And I'm hearing impaired.  I even took my hearing aids out and it was still loud.  Oh, and they serve pizza, salad, beer, soda and have a sundae bar.  I had the pizza, it wasn't bad if you count frozen pizza as delicious.  The salad greens were fresh and industrial quality, the dressings were the big four, Blue Cheese, French, Ranch and Italian, all apparently coming from a jug.  maybe the same jug - as I tried the ranch and the blue cheese and there was no discernible difference other than the blue cheese had some soft lumps of something in it.    The iced tea was watery and instant, but made recently.   If you have never eaten a tasteless salad and mediocre pizza washed down with watery beverages while being pounded by organ style show tunes sound, sitting at cafeteria-style tables, then you gotta try this place.    If you go back it's your own damn fault."}
{"text":"I'm back. . .  and this place is as good as it was when I first came here in '08.  Apart from the organ, which is the main attraction that everybody is drawn to, I like the pizza here.  For me, the sauce on a pizza is everything, and this place has great sauce.  The pizza overall is a bit pricey, drinks are not bottomless, and this is absolutely no place to go if you are in a hurry to get somewhere after you eat.  But, if you want to spend an evening with your family enjoying pizza and listening to a pipe organ with all the bells and whistles (literally), this is a good destination."}
{"text":"A fun place for the family.  Where else can you enjoy pizza, salad and ice cream while listening to the theme from Star Wars on an organ?"}
{"text":"The facility is incredible! The extensive display of musical instruments and vast array of pipes complement the beautiful Wurlitzer organ.   The organists are extremely talented and make it a point to play your requests and recognize your celebrations (anniversaries, weddings, etc.).   The mood lighting, great pizza and salads, bench seating and affordable prices will result in a memorable visit to Phoenix for your guests!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying good food, very clean and the staff was very nice.  BUT... When you own a business you must make sure there is not \"painful payment\" for your customers . For starters they do not accept debit or credit....only cash or checks..yes checks, who writes those any more? They offer you the ATM in the lobby that charges $2.50 to use plus the fee that your bank charges to use a n ATM that is not owned by your bank. So right out of the gate you are paying around  $5 just to pay them for your food, if you didn't bring cash. Also when you place your order and pay you are then sent around to the drink department, where you pay again.  Why not just collect the full amount when you place an order.   Also when we went I went with ONE friend. The seating there is for large groups and if you are in a small group you are forced to sit with strangers.  It could be a little awkward.   I guess the over all review is this.... Great food but  HORRIBLE  set up. You can tell just from they way they conduct business that ownership is trying to nickle and dime you."}
{"text":"I want to review this because of a poor review I read recently tha I don't believe is fair. Also, lots of bad reviews about the pizza compared to a high school pizza or frozen one. So, let's begin with the pizza.   Rating 3.   Ok. It's not a gourmet pizza with fancy toppings and a nouveau riche name, but it was not a kin to a frozen pizza or one found in a high school cafeteria   It was very basic but fresh. Good crust. I liked it. I gave it a 3 simply because it's basic and good   Regarding the entertainment .... rating 5.  Regarding the one star review by another reviewer who complained of the noise, well, uh, it's a Wurlitzer organ with over 5500 pipes not to mention other instruments connected such as drums, xylophones, piano etc. Plus, there's families with kids. But the noise is not cacophonous . And the organist is a concert organist. Who, I might add, plays by memory all sorts of arrangements. You can even make requests, and from what I saw he played all the songs from memory.  The pipes are behind class with baffling, so the organist controls the volume by opening and closing the glass baffles. You are not going to come out with tinnitus, like at a rock concert.  I mean, where else can you go for about 10 to 20 bucks for pizza and sit for an hour and hear a concert. Very friendly place. Great atmosphere. Decent food. Lots of family fun. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I can really only echo Pepper T.'s post.  I don't think there's much that I can add.  Our small group of adult fun-seekers thoroughly enjoyed our night out at Organ Stop Pizza.  As others have noted, you don't come here for the pizza.  That said, it wasn't bad.  I don't think it's so poor as Chuck E. Cheese pizza (granted it's been years since I've eaten it) and it's definitely better than Little Caesar's.  It's not the cheapest, but you're also paying for the experience. Some have complained about the salad bar being a single visit deal -- which it is -- but if you work it right, you get plenty for your bucks. While we didn't get ice cream, they do have a pretty good selection of Shamrock Dairy ice creams.  It was very fun to watch the theater pipe organ in action.  It really is a show, with lots of contraptions engaging at different times throughout any given song, making it both a visual experience as well as an auditory experience.  This is another place I'd definitely revisit, were I to be in the valley.  For us, driving from Downtown, it is a drive, but for something we'll do once or twice, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Let the organ be your reason to come here, not the food or atmosphere.  This place has two personalities that don't quite mesh: the food and decor feel like a cafeteria, and the organ music is like watching a show. They have pizza, sandwiches, ice cream, a limited salad bar (one time) and drinks. The pizza is fairly thick and dough like and is in the category of frozen pizza quality.   You order at the counter when you walk in and get a plate for salad and there's a separate area to order drinks, including alcohol. You can be seated downstairs or upstairs, with some seats with backs. Your number will pop up and you'll know to return to the counter to pick up your pizza.   The organ is an interesting spectacle and is 80 years old. During various songs, different parts light up and mechanical cat puppets and a Mickey mouse flag may make an appearance. You can also put in requests. I was surprised that the songs varied from Unchained Melody and It's a Small World to Thriller and Disney hits. The organist takes a break at a few points and starts at 5:30 on weekdays.   Apparently they also host kid's birthday parties and they have a small arcade and a small store that sells junkie stuffed animals etc. There's a sign that says no running around.  A pretty \"cheesy\" place but an interesting one-time experience. We walked out with a somewhat dazed expression."}
{"text":"Okay so the pizza isn't horrible, but it's definitely not the best I've ever had.  It's basically something to eat while you're entertained by the live music.  The cool thing about this place is that it's fun for little kids and adults.  The menu consists of pizza (of course) but they also have pasta options and appetizers like cheese sticks and garlic bread.  The food is reasonably priced, and decent enough, so I recommend having a bite to eat while you're here.  They serve beer and wine too!"}
{"text":"Excellent show while you enjoy a pretty fair pizza. You don't necessarily come here for great food but the entertainment is top shelf. What a colossal organ with literally ALL the bells, whistles and anything mechanical that can make a musical sound. Don't miss the big show!"}
{"text":"This was one unique place to visit!  My family loves adventures and restaurants that double as experiences.  The Organ Stop Pizza fit that bill well!  The pizza was average, but coupled with the organ music (which was more recent than you would expect!), it was a great find in Mesa!  It is a come as you are place and it was packed!  So we were all comfortable as we ate and listened (and sang to) the music.  It is worth giving it a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful and fun dining experience! Prepare to be amazed!! So cool! The kids and adults can put in song requests, too. I'm vegan and the veggie pizza without cheese was flavorful. The onion rings and fried mushrooms were great. I've traveled around the world and this is a unique atmosphere for locals and tourists alike! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great family venue. And the pizza is pretty good too. The history and scope of the place is pretty impressive. It really is a bit of yester-year that is becoming harder and harder to find. Just know to bring cash and some tune ideas for the organist to play. I'm guessing they'd prefer a little more variety than is usually requested. Most the crowds (with small kids) tend to eat earlier in the evening, so it's usually pretty spacious in the later hours."}
{"text":"the organ was excellent to listen to as we enjoyed out pizza.  Was there when they opened.  As the first set of music was played just before his break he performed national Anthem for Canada 1st then USA.  Honored to stand with everyone and Thank God for our Veteran's for our freedom.  Make this a stop when visiting Mesa, AZ"}
{"text":"I've heard about Organ Stop Pizza for several years, but living in Lake Havasu City, it was never convenient. We had the chance to go recently and it was fabulous! The music from the giant pipe organ was terrific and surprisingly, the pizza was excellent too. Kudos to the skill of the gentleman organist who played requests all evenings without the need for music sheets!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So strictly from an entertainment aspect, Organ Stop Pizza great! It really is a lot of fun. It was something different. The music and....choreography (maybe?) are awesome. Ok, there's no dancing but window slats and lighting and whatever move in time with the music. (Wow, possibly worst description ever. My apologies). But it's 2013 and a nice venue, but still is cash only? What also makes no sense to me is why I have to order and pay for my food at one register, and if I want a drink, I have to wait in a different line to do a completely separate transaction? And then there's the food. I read other reviews, ignoring the food, but come on now. IT'S A RESTAURANT! It's 90% about the food and the food sucked. Peter Piper Pizza has better food than this place. There was no redeeming quality in anything we ordered.  They say even bad pizza is still good. Not true. This was the first time in my nearly 33 year existence that I didn't take my left overs home. We had no desire to take them home. With the music and everything surrounding the Mighty Wurlitzer, I don't understand why they can't charge a few more dollars for better quality pizza. This place would probably be spot on the gourmet pizza, waiters, private tables and booths (instead of school cafeteria style tables/benches). It's obvious the owners are strictly in business for the money. They're penny pinchers. Why else would it be cash only (no transaction fees), low quality food (costs less to make), picnic bench style seating (cram as many people in as possible) and poor service (cheap labor). I want to go somewhere that wou can taste the owner or chef's passion for the food in the food.  The only saving grace is the organ. I go to a restaurant to eat. Entertainment is just a bonus.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is pretty neat, but I didn't have the best experience here. The ordering process is a little confusing and I didn't see any signs that said they were cash only. I had to go to the ATM then stand in the long line again. Once you order, they tell you to wait for your number to come up on the board. The number board is inside the dining room near the ceiling and it's hard to find!   I had the mushroom and sausage pizza. It wasn't bad but could have used more sauce. I had a glass of red wine which was served chilled....  I would give this place three stars but there were little bugs crawling on the table. ewwww!!!!!  We really enjoyed the organ player and would have stayed longer, but there were too many kids. This is a cool place to check out but watch out for creepy crawlies...unless you want them on your pizza."}
{"text":"The place clean and organized and has good pizza.And it is a good place to take your kids to see a show."}
{"text":"We had a great time being entertained while eating a delicous pizza. Yes it was crowd but there is plenty of seating. A special experience.... it is \"cash only\" so come prepared.  It was a fun time.."}
{"text":"Great entertainment. A must goto at least once and great for out of town guests and kids. Recommend eating a nice meal before and then enjoy some ice cream and entertainment here."}
{"text":"The dinner experience is enjoyable. They offer something you don't see everyday. But that is the only reason I gave it three stars. The whole place is extremely outdated. From their cash registers to their decor.   We are in the 21st century here. You can't expect people to only use cash and if they don't have that then they have to use your atm that charges an arm and a leg. Not only that but you have to make two separate purchases, one for food and one for drinks. What is that about?   I do think it is a cool place your kids would enjoy maybe once or twice but that is about all I can handle."}
{"text":"My \"must place to go\"! We're from NC and visit our son and daughter-in-law in Mesa, AZ.  We always go to Organ Stop and have a great time. Love it especially at Christmas. Looking forward to going Aug. 11th. Can't wait!  Jan Peterman  NC"}
{"text":"This was worth the trip to Phoenix.  Outstanding.  We heard Toccata and Fugue in D minor by Johann Sebastian Bach followed by Michael Jackson's Thriller.  Do this, or you will go through life with a void.  A void that could be avoided if you are ever in the Phoenix Area."}
{"text":"One of a kind place Food is meh, come for the organ You can request a song Dancing cats Had a birthday party there"}
{"text":"All y'all bitchin about the pizza are wack, this place is the best every time , talented organ player, amazing view of all the instruments, you guys saying it's too loud must be in your upper 70's. Here's a tip, don't go to an organ show if you expect it to be quiet."}
{"text":"We LOVE Organ Stop!!! I have been going to Organ Stop for DECADES!! It used to be on Central Avenue prior to a new building being built specifically around this massive (the WORLD'S LARGEST THEATER) organ!! There are THOUSANDS of pipes, windows that open and close to the ears and eyes delight and lights of many colors highlight the pipes!! This would LITERALLY be the LONGEST review I have EVER done if I listed EVERYTHING that makes this place AMAZING and UNFORGETTABLE!!!  I had a family member from out of town meet me here for her first time. She was really annoying as she acted like Negative Nelly until the music started. She started swaying and singing along!! She was seriously embarrassed for acting like such a negative fool!!!  For those who complain the music is too loud:  You don't belong here or anywhere. My 8 year old kid has very sensitive ears and HE does not complain about it being too loud!! Every been to a concert or a night club? This doesn't get nearly as loud!!   Just be warned, there will literally be HUNDREDS of people waiting to get in during peak hours (for a couple / few hours). Get there when it first opens to avoid waiting for a long time to get in!! ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Organ Stop Pizza for over forty years. The food is inexpensive but they never skimp on quality. The ambience is family friendly and engages young and old alike. I travel home once a year and Organ Stop is always on our list of must things to do."}
{"text":"Ok here it goes....If you are looking for amazing food this is not your place. It is ok pizza at best. Stick with the pizza. Trust me! The place only takes cash but have an ATM inside to get the cash which is a pain in the butt. So why the 4 stars????????????  I have a definate affinity for the most unusual, off the wall, freakish, wickedly awesome, magical attractions I can find. I like attractions that you can barely imagine in your mind. I Iike attractions that you cannot accurately describe to others due to the sheer awesomeness of what you experienced. Organ Stop is a place that has impressed me every time I have visited. Do yourself a HUUUUGE favor and get there before the show starts. You can litterally feel the anticipation of the patrons that know what you are about to experience. I do not want to ruin anything that you may see, hear or feel during the wondeful performances. What I can attest to is that one of the songs made my wife cry. I can honestly say that if you are open minded, young at heart, believe in magic, and are not a stuffy pretentious person, this place is a veritable treasure trove of wonderful experiences. It truly is a freakishly fantastic place that will leave you wanting more."}
{"text":"The best family pizza place around! Great entertainment, good atmosphere and food is good. Great place to bring kids and a seniors too! Lol"}
{"text":"This is WORST PLACE EVER. They lost our reservations, then treated us disrespectfully in regards, screwed us around with finding our own seating, for our group of 25 bikers, they dont accept Credit or debit Cards, you order food at one end, then drinks a different place. Associates act like they have no clue what they are suppose to do taking orders or making change. Dont recommend to anyone.  Only highlite of evening was Organ Players show"}
{"text":"Very fun and unique experience. Good pizza and ice cream. Great family joint. Only problem is cash only and sometimes it is tough to get a table."}
{"text":"I discovered Organ Stop Pizza 15 years ago, and I have been returning ever since.  I am a professional musician and piano technician, and I have the background and experience to rate the musical experience and quality of the Mighty Wurlitzer theater organ there as among the finest in the world.  The organists are international concert and recording artists recognized by the highest professional organizations. The Mighty Wurlitzer theater organ there is described at the largest of its type in the world.  Combine all these facts with a truly first-class pizza house and you have at minimum a 5-star winner -- I wish I could rate them higher!!  If you have never been, it will be the 8th wonder of the world for you.  Be sure to take your children, because the organ is one of only a few of the world's remaining large theater organs born in the silent movie age of 1890-1930.  Go and remain amazed forever !!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Organ entertainment and pretty good pizza too.  Organ plays 45 minute sets with 15 minute breaks.  This is great outing for all ages.  Well worth a couple of hours while in nearby Mesa.  Pizza, Salda bar, ice cream, Pepsi products and beer.  Bring CASH, no credit cards.  Good parking but always busy."}
{"text":"The only reason to come here is for the entertainment. The organ playing is pretty neat, but loud- it was very hard to have a conversation at the table.   Dont expect to get good customer service, the cashier didn't greet us- just stared at us until we ordered and failed to even tell us first time customers how their system works. You order food at one counter and drinks at another- paying twice, in which they only accept cash. You are given a number for your order and we were told it will light up when it is ready... ummmm ok? We ended up having to ask someone else if our order was ready as we had no clue what was supposed to light up.  The pizza is average and nothing to rave about- it is a little pricey but i guess they make it that way to pay for the entertainment."}
{"text":"I used to go there yearly with the retired in laws. I think they love it. The pizza tastes like it came from a box. Very crowded. Amazing organ player if that's your gig. Everyone should go there once in life, or should they?"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  The Wurlitzer is incredible.  Dinner and entertainment was so much fun. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but what brings people here is the Mighty Wurlitzer organ. The musicians are amazing. They take requests and play without sheet music. As much as I enjoy the professional musicianship, sometimes the medleys repeat and seem like they never end. We requested Phantom of the Opera (I'm sure they get that a lot), but it wasn't as grandiose as I had hoped. Extremely entertaining nonetheless. Sitting in the restaurant feels like sitting in a smaller version of Hofbrauhaus.  The restaurant only takes cash."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. We are thinking about coming back without the grandchildren so we can sit there all night enjoy the music."}
{"text":"Nice music on the world's largest theatre organ."}
{"text":"Fun place!  The pizza was delicious.  It is very easy to order and the service was fast!   It was amazing to listen to the organist play many requested songs.   Cash only.  There is an ATM machine by the door. Small game room that requires tokens."}
{"text":"Always love Organ Stop Pizza.  My grandparents always brought us here so it makes my heart happy to stop in.  The prices are more than fair and the pizza is great!  Staff were friendly and helpful.  The Organ is always entertaining to see and hear.  Very impressive!  If you don't like crowds or high volume places, this is not the place for you.  They are only open a few hours each day and are very busy within that window."}
{"text":"Random, but really cool! Great place to take the kids and keep the whole family entertained. Good place to take out-of-town visitors too. Had the BBQ chicken pizza which was delicious. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We have a love hate relationship with Organ Stop Pizza.  It's great for unique entertainment and is always a sure bet to entertain company with but, their pizza isn't very good.  It's ok when it first hits your table (watch for your number because you have to pick it up) but if you let it sit for more than 10 min, it's terrible.  Good thing they have a salad bar, ice cream and alcohol to soothe your pizza worries. Still, the organ player is amazing in his playing and talking to the crowd.  We'll continue to go there every year or so but would probably go more often if the pizza was just a little better.  Oh yeah, make sure you request your song before you get your pizza so that you'll have a chance to hear it!  And tip him."}
{"text":"As soon as you locate this place be aware that you'll search for a parking spot. This place is busy as it should. One of the first places we were told to visit when we moved here was to go here. It took us a year and a half but we finally made it when we went with out-of-town guests.   When you walk through the front door make sure you join in the line (to order your meal) and have someone in your party locate seats. In line you will see the simple menu, be ready when you get to the cashier.   Food: My husband and kids love pizza. This was the first time that we opted to not take leftovers home. That is a first. It's not a place for a meal. You're coming for time with friends and the show. Everyone at our table agreed that the company and entertainment was the best part. Not the pizza.   Service:  You would think that the staff understands that this is a destination for a majority of people that come here. Greeting people with a smile and answering questions like: How will I know when my order is ready? It must have pained our cashier to explain that there is a board with numbers that lights up when it is ready. When my husband asked, \"Where is it?\" she was agitated that we didn't see \"where\" it was. When you point aimlessly out the door, that gives us no idea. Effort is lacking in customer service.   Atmosphere: This is what you come here for. Although the decor is lacking and brings you back in time, you come for the entertainment. The kids loved it. Although none of their songs were picked they enjoyed chatting and deciding who was going to request it. You come here for the memory of seeing a giant Wurlitzer organ rise onto a stage and listen as a person plays every and any song you can imagine.   Parking: It was busy but the lot is huge and free. Don't be surprised if you see tour buses dropping people off.   This is a place that different generations will like for what it does and that is bringing people together.   Tips: bring cash and a smile."}
{"text":"It was definitely an experience eating here with my parents! The organ music was pretty incredible and the show is entertaining.  We happened to sit right underneath the bubble machine which got a little wet but the seats were great.  You definitely can't talk and have conversation here but the overall experience is unique and fun.  Now the food situation....kind of awkward.  It's cash only so be prepared to pay the ATM fee if you're like me and don't normally have cash on you.  Then the food ordering is segmented out.  So you order pizza and they give you a number.  Then you go to a separate counter and wait in line if you want to order drinks.  Then you find a seat, wait for your number to come up, and go pick up your food.  You grab your own plates, silverware, napkins, and condiments too.  The food was average and the set up is poor, but it's a neat experience overall.  I'm glad I can say I've been there once but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Horrible food (except the garlic bread, that was actually pretty good!).  It's annoying that they only take cash, I feel like this is 1995 again.   It's also annoying you have to go to two sections to order your drinks, you can't order them with your meal.  HOWEVER, it's cheap entertainment.   Have a little kid? Spend $25, take the family here, they will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Horrific pizza. Cool organ playing for kids and old people entertainment. If Barros pizza took over the pizza and food side of the place there would be a line out the door to come here. Just wish the food in general was better than the nasty stuff they served. Even the water taste like toilet water (if I would ever try toilet water I'd imagine that's what it tastes like) But Organist is very talented and that's what keeps the doors open."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for the organ players and one star for food. Meet in the middle at 3 because the music gets all the stars really."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for atmosphere, entertainment, and uniqueness.  You look all around you, up and down, see all the organ pipes and instruments hanging here and there, up and down, lots behind glass windows.  I have been to Organ Stop many times, and in other cities, but today I went because a financial planning company rented the entire place and the organist for a Eat and Greet for 150 people.  What I liked about this occassion is the organist gave about a 20 min \"tour\" of the organ, playing examples of it's many \"instruments\" and sound effects it does, and telling the history and uniqueness of the largest Wurlitzer pipe organ IN THE WORLD.    Today, all the elements of this organ would cost 5 million dollars to replicate.  It cost something like $37,000 in 1926, which to me is a LOT of money way back then.    I happen to like Organ Stop pizza because I love crispy thin crust pizza, that crunches when you bite into it, and \"stays horizonal 1 hour after coming out of the oven\".   I do not like pizza dough that is like uncooked cookie dough that is gooey and floppy.  Many pizzas are like that.   Organ Stop also spreads the toppings all the way to the edge, and adds plenty of cheese, so it is all hanging and stringy, when you separate the slices.  Peter Piper Pizza has similar crust, that is why I like that place too.    The lighting is a bit dark for me.    Everyone here is having fun and doing things with family.  Look around and see.  It is a good place to bring out-of-town people who have never experienced an Organ Stop place.  I am a pipe organ fan, it is my favorite instrument, but I like to hear Baroque pieces played on European organs, over theatre organ.  I love Widor's Toccatta from 5th Symphony, the bass is like Ommmmmm vibration.  But I don't think this organist would play that.    Here is a photo of my friend and her little Chinese hairless dog, \"Sidonie\".  My friend played organ for 7 years as a kid, and is here at Organ Stop for her first time.  She said \"When you come again, invite me!\""}
{"text":"-Tourist trap, nothing to special about this place besides a large organ.    -They don't take credit or debit cards, if they did the line would move faster & more efficient.    -really annoying you order & pay for food in one line & then have to go to a 2nd line to order & pay for drinks. No refills on drinks. Obviously the owners are tight wads for bit doing free refills & no credit cards.   -lots of old people, most crabby & inconsiderate.    -my kids thought it was cool but nothing   -Staff doesn't go above & beyond. I asked a girl picking up our dishes for a to go box & she said we have them downstairs you can get there.  Gee thanks as I'm sitting there with 2 young kids.   -Pizza is mediocre. Nothing great  -again just clearly a tourist trap."}
{"text":"Quite literally just a mediocre (at best) pizza joint with a giant wall organ in the dining room. The place was packed at 4 pm (when they open) as the average clientele qualifies for Medicare. Clearly here to see one of their own on the stage.  They don't do anything special for birthdays, however the organist will announce the name and play happy birthday.  All that being said... The organ is cool...  I've heard the organist can play anything (he did play Bohemian Rhapsody). Let's see if he knows \"Get Lucky\" by Daft Punk."}
{"text":"Organ Stop is like a trip down memory lane. Our family used to go a very looooong time ago, in the early 80's, when they were located in far West Mesa.   As a child I  can remember this giant organ bursting out of the ground like magic. As it towered over the audience, complete with lights and sounds I was mesmerized by its beauty. It's a childhood memory that is seared into my brain. I'm sure many of the children that go will find it truly magical.   The food is not what you go for, it is the entertainment and novelty of seeing this incredible organ being played, and the experience of enjoying something that you won't find many other places.   *****PLEASE NOTE****** They DO NOT accept credit cards!!! Cash or check only.  There is an ATM on site if you forget this."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the music and may go back for that which obviously is the only pull to this place. The food is terrible!! Medium veggie pizza and mozzarella sticks $26.00. For that much the food should at least be palatable. I don't think it is even real mozzarella cheese on the pizza. Weird consistency. Too many lines to stand in. More of a stressful environment than relaxing with everyone bumping into each other. And you can't help but laugh at the scam they have going with the cash only. You see it posted outside as you are already waiting in line with your family so of course you are not going to pull everyone out of line 1 to go to an ATM but resort to using their ATM in the lobby.  Now we all know you will get charged fees for this and if it was a regular bank I would understand. It literally tells you that this machine is owned by some guy. NOT a bank. Tell me that guy isn't affiliated with the restaurant owner. This whole experience was a let down in my opinion for a place that is touted everywhere as a great family experience. They know they have you and quite a racket it is. IF I ever go back we will be sure to have cash and go for ice cream. Thinking you can't cheap that out too much!"}
{"text":"I wish this was the kind of place to go for a good pizza, unfortunately it's the kind of placeI I would recommend going half full, with a few drinks in you, to enjoy one of the worlds largest organs displayed for quality entertainment purposes. God love this organ, I certainly do."}
{"text":"Holy Krap... did I drive from San Diego, California to Mesa, Arizona for PIZZA? Why yes, yes I did... and so should you. This place is wicked awesome and should be on the \"must see\" list for tourists and locals alike. If you have ever wanted to sit and eat pizza while listening to an organ and thought it might be just a bit offensive to do that in your local church in the middle of Mass... well, this place is for you. So... Only open for a few hours a day, depending on season; 3 or 4ish PM to well, check the schedule. People line up in front of the door and in typical crazy Arizona fashion, into the (*&(#$^% parking lot... GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY. Upon entry, you order your pizza at a hustle bustle counter (CASH ONLY PLEASE) and then move around to the salad area, if you happen to be one of \"those\" people. Same for beverages and desserts... separate pay and pick up areas. If you have more than one person, someone should be checking out the cavernous first floor room for seating. Everything is long tables and benches or chairs or something. If you are looking for a quiet spot with your honey... better luck finding that in the number 2 lane of the freeway outside. Your number pops up on two big screens hanging over the stairs to the wrap around balcony. Seems as if I wasn't the only moron who couldn't find the damn sign and just waited for the pizza to be ready. The pies are being made assembly style by teenagers making money for college and secretly wishing to die. Yeah, they had that look in the eyes as if they were praying for the world to end on their shift. So, into the big hall with I don't know how many seats, a couple hundred I would guess. Dominating the front of the room, looks like a stage with nothing on it... UNTIL...  in a circular motion, up comes the mighty Wurlitzer Console. You are transfixed because it is awesome looking. When the music starts and the lights come up, it's then you notice the back/front wall in front of the console is what most people don't see in churches. Many of an organ's pipes are in what are called \"swell boxes\" they have louvers on the front and open and close to control the volume. Here the louvers are clear and you can see how they work and the pipes inside. Then you notice there are pipes everywhere, even on that second floor seating balcony and in the ceiling. There are runner lights going in time with the music which is everything from Happy Birthday or the theme from the Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is a musical and lighting extravaganza. And to top it all off... the pizza is pretty damn good also. I had the pleasure of finally getting to see an old friend while there, so it was a double pleasure for me... triple if you count stopping in Yuma and partying with some friends there also.  Who the hell makes hotel friends and stops to see them... yeah, that would be me. If you have a second driver and want to go, enjoy the show and come back to S. D., fine. If not, there are reasonable hotels in the area where you can take your stuffed belly and overwhelmed senses to and stay the night. So, this place is awesome. Get there early, eat slowly, see two shows if you can. It is entertainment for kids and grownups alike. I'll be going back, often... ROAD TRIP anyone?"}
{"text":"We got there early and there was a line to the parking lot to get in. The senior citizens acted like kids by counting the minutes to get in. Three cafe style lines to order food at. These senior citizens jumped ahead of me in the beverage line. The onion rings were good. The pizza was some weird and mixture of blah. It was nice to see the worlds largest organ of its kind. But really, why do senior citizens have to act worse then terrible two year olds. The people under 18 were very well behaved."}
