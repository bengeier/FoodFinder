{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure. I have been coming here for about 5 years and have a great experience every time. On Friday and Saturday nights you can enjoy a truly authentic Italian dinner at the pasta bar. The ingredients are fresh and delicious and Tony will make your experience delightful! There is a variety of seating from comfy booths to a beautiful patio overlooking the pool. I have a small child and the owner and staff have always been very pleasant and accommodating. You can watch sports on the many tv's or enjoy a quiet dinner with your family; something for everyone. Also membership at the world health club is not required to visit!"}
{"text":"I worked at The Edgemont World Health for around  two years, within that I learned the dirty, disgusting secrets of this restaurant.  Lets start with the owner, Chris. Chris is an overly rude individual who suffers from little man syndrome, we often heard him and his kitchen staff screaming at each other from the reception desk. These yelling matches were a regular occurance. We frequently had his customers complain about how he wouldn't do anything to fix their issues.  He employs his two daughters, who bring their chihuahua into kitchen which I'm sure is very sanitary. The restaurant itself was fairly clean and that is probably because the housekeepers that work for World Health were the ones responsible for cleaning it. I've watched Chris and some of his staff  completly belittle the poor cleaners.

 The food itself is nothing special. They used to reuse a lot of the leftover food from the pasta and breakfast buffet which is one of the reasons they were shut down by the health comitee a few years back. The day front of house staff is usually more accomidating than the evening staff. Over all if you want food poisoning or a digestive disorder this is certainly the place to go, otherwise hit up Chianti's for cheaper, and cleaner Italian."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Edgemont Bar & Grill a few times as I workout at the World Health Club in which this restaurant occupies. It's usually fairly quiet, unless you go on pasta night which Jayde described. I had the pleasure of trying it a few months ago and it was excellent! Tons of options, variety, and the chef is truly talented and will make the most wonderful bowl of pasta to your liking. The small size is MORE than enough, so unless you are planning to split your meal, don't get the large. I've also had their wings (pretty good), steak caesar salad (delicious), and a couple other appetizers. I find the food to be really good, and the servers to be very friendly. However, I do think the price is a little steep for what you get. I usually pop in here for a protein shake after my work out, and am always tended to quickly and pleasantly. If you score a spot on the patio overlooking the pool in the summer, you're golden!"}
{"text":"The pasta bar on Tuesday and Friday is great. If you lika da pasta, real traditional Italian pasta, Sepino is worth the visit. They also make a killer pizza. Check out The Peppy if you like Italian meats, basil and cream cheese. 

And ya, like Rob said, Guinness is served which for me is a huge must."}
{"text":"This is the most disorganized restaurant I have ever been to IN THE WORLD, not just in Calgary.  I go in and sit down, and there's no guarantee a waitress would come by asking how she can help.  That's because when you're just one person, these waitresses think of you as less of a customer.  They would rather serve big groups than individuals.

You might think... well, that's because a big group tend to give more tips.  Well, guess what?  I happen to be a member of the Edgemont Club (the landlord) for years, so they should at least treat me like a typical customer especially when they know I'll be telling the trainers and the gym members about any bad experience.

There's just no guarantee that a waitress will SEE you, let alone serve you.  They're present, don't get me wrong, but that doesn't mean they know YOU'RE present.  They don't have the habit of looking around to see who needs their assistance.  They're usually serving big groups, cleaning up the lounge area or typing away on their calculators, or they just stay in the kitchen for a long time.  One time I had to purposely call the restaurant number WHILE I was at the restaurant, because I knew the phone was at the front so the waitress would HAVE to come out to answer the phone.  That was when I got her attention.

And if you think you can just complain to the owner, don't bother.  The owner will get defensive and his defense won't even relate to your complaint, especially when the complaint is related to his daughter (who works as a waitress there) giving dirty looks when you tell her politely you've been waiting.  The owner would just say, \"Sorry you had to wait but we were really busy, so your complaint is unfair and unwarranted.\"  (I still have his e-mail to prove he wrote this.)  Um... hello?  Did you hear the part about your daughter giving me a dirty look?  Want to address that please?  (And that's when you get no reply.)"}
