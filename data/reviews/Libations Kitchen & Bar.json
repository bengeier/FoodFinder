{"text":"Had the grilled homemade salmon patties with grilled vegetables and yellow rice which the server recommended and it was Delicious!"}
{"text":"Well, I had to lower my rating from a 4 to a 2 based on my most recent visit (4/25/2016).  As you can see by my previous review below, I really liked this place when I visited in November of 2015.  My visit this evening started off bad and didn't get much better.  When I arrived, there was one seat remaining at the bar.  The lounge/dining area was almost empty, so I decided to just wait for a seat.  After standing there for 3 or 4 minutes the barmaid said she would be with me in a moment (there were a total of 3 employees working the bar/lounge).  Another 2 minutes went by and she told me to just sit wherever I wanted.  I sat at a bar table directly across from the center of the bar...for 20 to 25 minutes waiting for ANYBODY to wait on me.  The original barmaid walked past me 5 times, bringing food to the guy sitting next to me and drinks to others around me.  I thought maybe I wasn't sitting in her section and someone else might be at fault.  Finally, I got her attention and asked if I could get a menu.  She brought me a menu and didn't even offer me a drink still.  I should have realized the service was going to be terrible and left at this point, but I was hungry and my previous two experiences were at this place were very good.  I was able to order a water, soup and salmon with a side of fruit about 5 minutes later.  It took 10 minutes for her to bring my water, another 20 minutes from that point to get the soup and then another 10 minutes for the salmon and instead of fruit I got vegetables.  The potato and chicken soup was just okay this visit--it had a different flavor.  The asked for the salmon to be prepared medium and it came out completely raw in the center, although the flavor was decent for the portions around the edge that were cooked properly.  However, the vegetables that I did not order were delicious!  I decided to order brownie desert since I didn't quite eat all of my food and she informed me they were out of ice cream.  I just chuckled at that point.  I hope this terrible experience is simply the result of a poor group of employees working on this particular night.  If it weren't for my previous experience I would have wanted to give this place a negative rating!  I am not sure I will risk coming back unless I see a different group of employees working.  -------------------------------------  There are very few hotel meals that I would ever take the time to rate. My meals at Libations this week were amazing!   The Potato & Chicken soup is one of the best soups I have ever tasted. I had a cup on Monday and I was considering ordering a second cup after my meal came.  However, the salmon I ordered for my main course was also incredible and I did not have room for any more deliciousness.  I decided to come back on Wednesday to get some more potato and chicken. This time I ordered a bowl and slammed it! So awesome! There were many good choices on the menu so I decided to try the fish and chips this time.  The fish didn't knock me off my feet, but it was still good.  I can't wait until my next Charlotte trip so I can get some more soup and maybe try some other items on this menu.  BMarkus"}
{"text":"My friends and I celebrated a 40th birthday party at Libations this weekend. The food and service was phenomenal! We broke the rules by ordering the chocolate covered bacon as an appetizer (instead of dessert) and I recommend everyone trying this. Every dish was rich and flavorful  but my personal faves were the flatbread and the shrimp and grits. I will definitely come back for dinner and everyone that accompanied me agreed that it was one of the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food was blah. We ate dinner and the entrees and appetizers seem way over salted. It seems salt and crushed red pepper are all the chef knows how to use. My coworker had tacos and the fish was flavorless and the pork was the WORST barbecue either of us have tasted. My short rib was nowhere near cooked enough so it was gristly and hard to chew.   The bartender, Angelina, was incredibly rude and was badmouthing other employees in front of us and the other five people at the bar. The other girls, Stacie and Mel, were fantastic and friendly, but not actually serving me.   When I attempted to notify the manager of Angelina's poor attitude and slow service, she blew me off and was so rude that I will never eat here again. If the whole ten people I. The restaurant are overwhelming for you as a manager, Kristen, perhaps it's best to leave the industry. Switch to something that is not customer facing and doesn't require people skills because yours are beyond lacking.   I work across the street when I'm in town, which is very often, but I will go out of my way to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tonight I took the family to Libations for an early dinner.  I had heard a lot of good reviews and was excited to dine there tonight.  The restaurant was empty and I have to wait about 10 minutes before a waiter to appear. We started with some appetizers.  The mac and cheese was delicious but the calamari was a bit too bready and salty.  For dinner we had the NY strip, fish & chips, and some hamburgers for the kids.  Overall, nothing stood out as particularly good. Food was a little on the bland side and the kids fries were soggy. The meal was average and I would say expensive for what you got. They do have a nice selection of beers from local breweries. Overall, not the best experience but certainly not the worst experience. I would try other restaurants before I go back."}
{"text":"Arrived for 730 reservation. Nice to see a reservation sign waiting for our table. We had to move from the booth they reserved because I sunk in the seat so my chest was smashed in the table. Unfortunately we lost our nice bubbly server for a dry, alcohol pushy one. We weren't in the mood to drink so that seem to annoy her.  We ordered our food. Secret lobster salad was very good. We both ate that. He ordered chicken and waffles. Cute presentation. We read the menu and knew it would be savory not sweet. It was, and he liked it. I had the grouper and clams. The menu didn't say it would be a soup. No spoon was brought so I'm using a fork to go through lima beans, tomato, and \"charred\" corn. Half of the corn was raw and the other half was burnt. Since the cooked grouper was at the bottom of the soup, it became overcooked, shriveled, and tough. I would have tried to make it work but the taste was way too salty.  I pushed it away. Our server asked if I wanted a box! How do you box salty soup?!? I told her my plight and she asked if I wanted to reorder...no lady I'm just going to sit here and look dumb. No apology, empathy, anything. I gaze at the bubbly server and wish we had her. I would be eating by now. So I reordered the trout. It was very good.  Our server came to check on us. And brought a dessert menu. We ordered the Italian ice dessert. It was a nice play on it. When she brought the check, she didn't even acknowledge me. She just told my boyfriend to enjoy the rest of his birthday weekend."}
{"text":"Michael Watson is THE best chef in the world, I would say! His special creations are beyond deliciously amazing. In a word, the food here is simply fantastic! The attention to detail of the food is fascinating too. Too bad I was too hungry to share a pic with you, but if you come here, you will totally forgive me."}
{"text":"Service issues were quickly resolved. This place has great food. I have gone for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Never to be disappointed. Tonight I had the short ribs over mashed sweet potatoes. Yummy!   If you can help wait to be seated and the food to come out then it's worth a try. That's all I got to say!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for restaurant week and split the following.  Definitely recommend you try them.  Park in the hotel parking deck and they'll validate parking.  - Smoked Pork Belly - tomato bacon jam, crispy greens, Libations BBQ     - Delicious!  Might be heavy for some with the awesome bacon jam after a few bites but works great if you go back and forth between another app. - Gnocchi & Braised Beef - short rib, truffle, wild mushroom, Sunny Creek Farms tomatoes, ricotta     - The flavor was great.  If you don't like salty it might be heavy for you but I really liked it. - Double Pork Chop - smoked Gouda whipped potatoes, roasted Brussels, orange coriander beurre monte     - pork was thick but a little overcooked but still delicious with the perfect bite of all items together. - Broiled Salmon - winter squash risotto, charred broccolini, Chardonnay, lemon butter     - was very good - Double Chocolate Brownie - mocha ice cream, marinated berries     - I'm not a big coffee fan but the mocha ice cream went very well with the brownie.- Seasonal Bread Pudding - Bourbon crème Anglaise     - didn't have room after all the above so just had 1 bite but it was good"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal, get the elk, just do it. I got the bbq pork shank and it had like a Mediterranean infusion to it LOVED it too! Got the chocolate covered bacon it was a LOT for 2 people and very rich! The wait staff seems brand new and there wasn't truly much organization as far as that goes. In the beginning of the meal everything was good and we were the only ones in the restaurant then it grew to about 8 tables among 3 waitresses and you would have thought it was 55 tables the service just struggled and  you could tell they felt overwhelmed. Hoping it's just a new team and something they are working through. The parking is VERY inconvenient but I will say the quality of the meal made it completely worth it. Wish they had a standalone somewhere else not in a hotel we would probably go more often. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Wow!  That was phenomenal! Executive Chef, Mike Watson, and his team know what they are doing in the kitchen!  I confess that I probably never would have tried this restaurant if it had not been for the 30% discount offered during Yelp Restaurant Week.  My previous experiences dining in hotel restaurants had left me less than impressed.  But the other reviews for Libations Kitchen & Bar on Yelp and the current discount encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and again,  . . . .WOW!  My husband and I were dining together and ordered everything to share -- because the whole menu looked tempting.  First out was the calamari.  This was not your average plate of fried seafood.  It was more like a delectable calamari salad.  It was served on a delicate bed of arugula, but what made it stellar was the other ingredients -- the pork belly, crushed olives, and peppers with a very light tasting citrus aioli.  The mixtures of sweet and sour were perfect.  And just when we thought things couldn't get better, our scallops arrived with their tomato bacon jam (YES -- bacon!), candied orange (who knew that a sliver of citrus could add so much complexity and delight?!), and chive oil!  They were succulent and tender and will be the first thing that I order when we return to Libations.  For our main course, we ordered the Libations Wagyu.  A massive burger of top grade Japanese beef with ham, blue cheese, port wine jelly, onion rings, bacon aioli . . . .I was feeling pretty full and satisfied at this point and knew that dessert was coming, so I was only able to eat a portion of the burger -- for which my husband was thankful.  (He's eating it with the leftover sweet potato fries for lunch today.)  Last but not least, was the dessert . . . .pecan pie.  But this wasn't your mother's pecan pie!  It was laced with brandy (or some other equally decadent infusion) with a caramel sauce drizzle and there was more of the gooey yummy part that you really, really want pecan pie to have!  The pie was not listed on the dessert menu, so it's unclear whether this is a regular item or not, but if it is offered when you dine there, be sure to try it!  The ambiance of the restaurant was nice enough that we felt that we'd had a special night out, but casual enough that hotel guests didn't feel that they had to dress up for dinner.  Our service was top notch, with our server Clare going above and beyond to make sure that we had a nice experience.  Would we eat there again?  Absolutely!  And we will take friends with us next time!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me to process and I'm going to explain why. Normally when you review a place you review a few things that make? the overall experience wonderful. Food, Service, and Prices. Although my food was extremely delicious they fell short on a couple other elements. I promise to be as truthful? as possible with my opinion of this establishment.  I walked in around 8 pm? last night and was meeting a few of my co-workers? for dinner. They started without me and ordered the crispy? potatoes? small plate. It was delicious to us but my coworkers? felt it fell short of on presentation and I can agree why they felt that way. We all know truffle oil is expensive and we're trying to grasp the $9.50 price tag for homemade style potato? shavings/chips.  I'll transition to the waitress staff first then move onto my dish selection. On this specific night,? the waitress staff is young and seemed inexperienced. They weren't able to ?handle the rush and seem to struggle to wait on the tables. She came over to take my drink order, I asked? for lemons for my water and she forgot altogether?. We waited awhile to place our order after that.   I ordered the Truffled Mac & Cheese and the Boneless Shortrib for my dinner. First, everything was delicious and I enjoyed the dishes. The small plate was larger? than my main course and that was a little dishearting. The name for the dish Mac & Cheese is very confusing. Although you have a description below the name, the word mac had me waiting for some macaroni. Yes, i know gnocchi is a form of pasta. The gnocchi was outstanding. I wish there was more on my main dish. The short rib? was amazing as well. The flavors worked well together.   Finally, it shouldn't? take over an hour and a ?half to get our food. That's? a huge problem for me. I appreciate fresh hot food, but when my co worker's food comes out warm, that's upsetting to? me. I could overlook this if all the food came out equal. I spent over $40 on myself alone. The heavy? price tag? for anyone to pay. For me,? this place is once and awhile next time I come to? town. But, I won't? make it a habit.     \"My review is strictly my opinion based on my experience and interaction with this company & persons while they provided me a service. This review is not to be translated as fact. My review is truthful to the best of my ability and not presented to harm the business but encourage them to perform better. I have not received any monetary gain for writing this review\" - Bruno F"}
{"text":"A friend and I went for Queen's feast.  The service was outstanding and the food was amazing. I was surprised that more people weren't there.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came back for more and were so happy! This time had the wings (topped with blue cheese, yum!) and the bacon cheeseburger (amazing). Menu will be changing again shortly and we will be back to try that too!"}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and am very disappointed in the service and food. Very slow service, inconsistent quality of food, and watered down drinks. Do not recommend this place when there are so many awesome places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week.  The food was wonderful but dang they need to hire more servers.  We had the gnocchi appetizer which was absolutely to die for. Phenomenal. I had the fried chicken and waffles, and the jam on the waffles was unique but a little too spicy.  The broccolini was nicely done.  For dessert I had the key lime pie, and it was the best I have ever had. My sister got the banana pudding and it looks like a pile of gray mess, totally unappetizing.  After 15 minutes I had to get up and go to an empty table and grab some spoons bc we were promised utensils for dessert and hey never came. The waitress was really nice but was the only one in the entire dining room. If Libations wants to play in restaurant week they need to step it up. The front desk peeps were SOOO friendly when we left and got out parking slip stamped. But then the parking machine would not let us out and our slip had been stamped! We ended up having to pay 6$ I think.  This left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not return."}
{"text":"I would give our experience a 5 star rating, but yelp probably would not show it since I do not regularly review. The entire evening was fantastic. I am from out of town, when we got downtown there was easy parking at the Double Tree. The restaurant was clean and crisp. Our Bartender Angelina greeted us warmly. We worked our way through the menu, starting with the cutting board, Local honey to accompany several cheeses and meats, garlic roasted olives and bread. Next we enjoyed the Jalapeno drop biscuits with country ham. The \"prosecco  and shrimp\" was lively and delicious. Jumbo shrimp cocktail served with frozen prosecco and basil. Two of the soups were next. The Chicken soup with potato dumpling was hearty while I enjoyed the tomato and lentil broth. The tomato soup was light with an Asian sweet and sour flair. I went steak for my entrée, my guest went short rib. Both dishes were expertly prepared and presented. To finish it off we tried and loved the dark chocolate covered bacon with sea salt. the wine selection had every flavor profile I was looking for. The prices were reasonable. The service was prompt, polite and efficient, her knowledge of the food and wine was superb. Hats off to you Chef, you got a good thing going. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent asparagus and leek soup! Great take on Mac and cheese! Quiet. Fast and friendly service. A real plus for doubletree Hotel."}
{"text":"A group of three including myself enjoyed a delicious meal at Libations. We came in around 8:30-9:00pm and were seated promptly. We shared a bottle of wine (about $30) and ordered meals because we were starving. Unfortunately, the meals took about 40+ minutes to come out.  When the meals came out, we all enjoyed them. I had the seared fillet of ribeye which comes with lemon pea risotto, mushrooms and pea tendril salad. I substituted in their common sides: fresh vegetables and sweet potato mash. The steak was cooked to perfection and well-seasoned. The sweet potato mash was something I'd never tried before and it was delicious with a hint of maple. The mushrooms and vegetables were also tasty.   My husband enjoyed the fish special and our friend enjoyed another entree which is slipping my mind. The meal came to around $140 plus gratuity. This seems very reasonable. We want to try other places since we are new to the area but we will certainly come back at some point and definitely recommend Libations to friends and relatives!    One star removed for wait time and lack of acknowledgment for long wait by staff members. If they had warned us it would be a while that would have been fine!"}
{"text":"This was my first Yelp Restaurant Week...picked this place since it was on the list and I always wanted to try it. Let me say...it was a Saturday night so thought the atmosphere would've been live but it was very blah. Guess only people who come down are the folks staying at the hotel. But what a waste to have it tucked away because the food and drinks were sooooo good. But how I rate things includes food, drinks and atmosphere so thats why the 3 Star. My waitress was pleasant ... I believe her  name was Melody, a J&W Student."}
{"text":"Awesome group of people. I was talking about how I have never had chicken and waffles before and the chef made them up from scratch.  Incredible!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was delicious!  I got the pork shank and everything that came with it melded nicely with each other.  It came with mashed potatoes and carrots with spinach.  My boyfriend got the elk and that was really good too.  The mashed sweet potato and bok choy went nicely with the meat."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, super friendly staff and reasonably priced. Great spot for lunches, get togethers or a romantic night out. The calamari is delicious and prepared with kalamata olives and hot cherry peppers. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Best service we've had in a long time. Restored our faith in the hospitality industry. Menu choices were diverse and unique flavor combinations. Definitely need one app per person or be willing to share them family style but know they are small in size but rich in flavor. I had the bbq pork shank and husband had the elk. Both were prepared perfectly and served hot. Cocktail mani was also fun and different than all the typical same thing over again. Will be back guaranteed."}
{"text":"Will admit I was hesitant since it's in a hotel but I am sold! The staff were great, the wine list was impressive and the food was epic! Oscar made me feel welcome and Franklin took care of our every need. Going to be a regular for cocktails and apps with girlfriends. Try the charcuterie and scallops and the everything. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Was simply too tired to go elsewhere.  Ordered the wings. Good flavor and portion.   Meatloaf was delicious and portion size was very good.   Ordered the lemon chicken soup which was surprisingly flavorful - filled with veggies and chicken. Tasted very fresh.   My associate ordered a shrimp Caesar and a side of broccoli. Again, good portion sizes.   Without the wine, the total came to $52.  Pretty reasonable for a hotel.   I would return, even if there all alternatives."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I had an incredible spur of the moment date night here! We had a gift card to use to several different participating restaurants and decided to try Libations, not knowing a thing about it. A little out of our way from Fort Mill but so worth it! The bartender, Angelina was such a delight! She was witty, kind & had great recommendations. Their olive & cherry pepper brined martini was by far the best martini I have ever had! The food was to die for, unique takes on classic dishes! Will definitely be returning. All around great experience! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Our server Angelina was exemplary!!! Her personal care of our experience is to be commended. She made sure our drinks and food came to our table perfectly. Our compliments to the chef as well! Neither of us tasted anything that was not pleasing to our palate."}
{"text":"Pretty nice hotel bar/restaurant.  We only had the breakfast, we ordered off of the menu, but the buffet looked delicious and well stocked.  Our omelets were really good, and fruit plates were sweet and ripe.   Good coffee.  We hung out and had drinks there two nights, and were satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing food and delightful service! Mel from England was a joy and the food was cooked perfectly--"}
{"text":"I was beyond pleasantly surprised to have this caliber of cuisine at a restaurant in a hotel.  The bartender was a doll, even the atmosphere music was great.  Comfy seating and, most importantly, DELICIOUS food.  Nothing like a properly cooked steak and savory sides with a good class of wine."}
{"text":"The Libations burger is the best burger I've ever had. Gia was the most amazing server, and was able to give our table a free app for it being our first time. I will definitely be back, especially since I work so close!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for the Half Marathon and although I had every intention of catching an Uber to a nice Charlotte Italian restaurant, as dinnertime neared closer, I just decided I didn't feel like going anywhere. I considered room service but after seeing the Yelp reviews of the hotel restaurant, I figured I'd give it a try.   I was greeted by a nice gentleman who sat me in a booth. I really liked him. He made conversation with me and I told him I was doing the half marathon the next day and he asked me questions about it. Really nice guy--although I think he was a hotel associate and not part of the wait staff.   Anyways, I wanted to keep it simple so I ordered one of my faves; cheeseburger & fries! I had seen a pic on here of the fries and they looked so good! I love french fries so I was very excited to try those. My meal probably came out in ten mins or less. Right away I grabbed a fry, dunked it into some ketchup anddd........gross!!! Idk if it was thyme or Rosemary (bc I hate both and can't tell which is which) but that's the only flavor I could taste. I honestly could only eat about five fries bc they were completely ruined by that seasoning. Ugh!   The burger was ok. I asked for no lettuce, tomato or onion but it came out with onion on it anyways. I wasn't crazy about the onion after-taste since they had it laying on the bun. I ate half the burger and took the other half up to my room for later. It was a very basic burger. I've had much better and was not impressed with the flavor of this one.   I was considering dessert but that became a big \"hell no!\" when I saw that the cheapest one was $10. Thanks but no thanks.   Overall, I was pretty disappointed based on my experience VS the reviews I saw here. Only thing saving this from a 2 rating was the very nice gentleman that who helped me get seated and brought my water. The actual waitress who came later was not very friendly; didn't even introduce herself. Looking back, I wish I would have just gotten room service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Restaurant Week. The offerings were off the regular menu. We were extremely pleased and surprised at the quality of our dinner. It is located in the Double Tree, right next to Johnson and Wales. You can park in the hotel ramp and they will validate your ticket. To start, I had the best martini ever! The \"Make It Filthy\", had two actually. Our appetizers were first rate. I had the deviled eggs on a mound of fried onion strings with pork belly lardons. My husband had the biscuits and berries and he was very happy. For dinner, I had a very nice cornmeal crusted trout, no bones! It was served over the best lemon and pea risotto ever. My husband had the elk and really enjoyed it. Dessert was a coconut cake for both of us. Not too big, which was nice, with caramel and chocolate drizzle. Service was top notch, well timed. Our server refilled our waters as needed, always replaced our silverware, answered all our questions. The restaurant itself, while in a hotel lobby, was very modern and comfortable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was too late for breakfast as it finished at 10 am. So I took an early lunch. The asparagus and ham was good with lovely poached eggs. The previous evening we came for dinner. My husband ordered the chefs charcuterie plate with crusty bread. It came toasted and was rock hard. We asked for some un-toasted bread. We waited around 20 minutes for it and the waitress kept saying they were freshly cutting it. Whatever that means. I ordered the duck duck goose. The wait staff kept saying it would be out shortly. I waited around 45 minutes. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so have  no idea why so long The confit potato hash was burnt along with the asparagus. I am not usually a duck eater but thought maybe it was over cooked also as I thought duck should be at least slightly pink. I am no expert so I really don't know if the temperature of the duck was good or not. Today's meal was a lot more pleasant"}
{"text":"We visited Libations for restaurant week and we were pleasantly surprised by this quaint spot nestled in to the doubletree hotel. The host was spot-on and knew exactly who we were when we walked in- quite a welcome. We started off with a bottle of 2013 Zinfandel, their wine list is not huge but has something for everyone. Although we didn't try a cocktail they looked tasty! Each of us tried the restaurant week menu planning on splitting (of course). By far the best plate was the truffled Mac and cheese - the aromatics from the truffles hit you as soon as it's placed in front of you, and the gnocchi was light and melted in your mouth. 2nd place goes to the two dessert, my fiancé is a chocolate man and absolutely loved the ganache. I usually am not a huge dessert fan but the basil Italian ice was on point - I will recreate this at home. The main dishes didn't excite me, the chicken and waffles was disconnected but the chicken by itself was very tasty! All in all I will definitely go back, but don't judge me if you see me focusing solely on a huge plate of truffle Mac and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"I tried Libations' gnocchi mac and cheese at the CLT \"S'macdown\" yesterday.. It was easily my favorite of the 20+ restaurants. It was so delicious, and the gnocchi added a different spin to the dish. They served it with a slice of brisket that was so tender and flavorful. We were so impressed we ended up going to the restaurant afterwards for drinks & dessert. We found out they have a special \"game day\" menu featuring things like nachos. We tried them and they were very good. We also tried the brownie sandwich and were very impressed. It was two huge brownies with mocha ice cream in between. It definitely fulfilled my sweets craving. Our server and the bartender were both very attentive and friendly. They really topped off an already perfect experience."}
{"text":"I am not a guest at the hotel, however, I heard great things about Libations. So I decided to give t a try and I must say it is perfect! Kevin and Zakia at the bar during breakfast were so at tentative and hospitable. I enjoyed my meal and their company. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We had a group luncheon there for work.  Over 15 people.  Food was excellent and the staff was on top of things.  Great job overall.  This is a huge upgrade from the previous dining establishment in the hotel.  Also, it's clearly the best option for dining/drinks in the Gateway area.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Libations is great! Excellent food, wine, and service. What's not to love. The charcuterie board is well worth the slightly high price, and the wagyu burger is delicious. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well, I consider myself a \"Hotel Restaurant\" snob as I usually don't find any of them to my liking.  I was a little apprehensive about going there last night, but wow, was I pleasantly shocked!  From the minute we sat down at the bar, we were treated like \"royalty\".  The bartender was great, the drinks were great....and priced likewise!  Oscar, the restaurant manager, came over, introduced himself and had a little chat with us.  He then found us a great table so we could enjoy our dinner.  He's a keeper!  The food was amazing.  We ordered a couple of small plates, including the Chucaterrie, and it was probably the best I have had in town.  The flavors of the different meat and cheeses, along withe everything else, was topnotch.  We were so full after those \"small plates\", all we could order was a Chicken Caesar salad to share.  It was definitely big enough for both of us and I love how it was deconstructed with homemade dressing on the side of the plate.  Oscar came back over and suggested we had to try the Coconut Cake with lemon filling.  Was that ever a great suggestion!  I can't wait to go back again and might have to do it again on Sunday!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night to celebrate an anniversary. It was so quiet and such nice atmosphere. I wish the music would be a little more in tune with the restaurant and food itself, but the setting is so intimate. The servers were great. We had the fillet, to die for! Perfectly cooked. The risotto was delicious! My husband ordered a classic cheeseburger which was so much more than we expected.  A mile high pile of bacon and picture perfect. A really delightful place for a special occasion. And the desert! Flourless chocolate cake! Devine!"}
{"text":"We checked out Libations just to try something new, and wow we were pleasantly surprised. The manager and our server were both extremely friendly and sociable despite it being busy.   For drinks, I got the Cool Hendrick, which wasn't too sweet but still had some nice flavors.   The impressive part of this place is the food. For appetizers, we got the country ham & Brussels, which is probably my 2nd favorite Brussels sprouts in Charlotte after Pisces. We also got chicken noodle soup, which was definitely made with some high quality ingredients. The chunks of chicken were huge and the broth had a ton of flavor.    And to round out the apps we got the jalapeño drop biscuits, which were great and not hard or dry at all.   For an entree we got the Joyce Farms half chicken, which had this great glaze/sauce and Gouda whipped potatoes. The chicken was so tender and the sauce with the potatoes had a ton of great flavor.   Finally, for dessert, we got the sticky bun, which had a lot good things happening in there with sauces and stickiness. It wasn't too huge either, so I was able to walk out of the restaurant on my own accord.   Overall this place was great. The food took a little but long, but it was very apparent that they make everything fresh. I would love to come back here to sit at the bar and enjoy some drinks and their small plates. Definitely an under the radar place to check out."}
{"text":"Incredible amazing young chef. Just came back from a trip and was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of food coming out of this hotels unassuming kitchen. I usually avoid hotel food if I can avoid it but I ended up eating there two nights in a row instead of going out. Nom."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in Charlotte for a last minute Memorial Day weekend getaway. We had decided to treat ourselves as we are celebrating some good news. After searching and reading reviews of restaurants, we decided on Libations as our \"fancy dinner\". When making the reservation, I noted that we were celebrating and if there is anything they could do to make the dinner more special, it would be greatly appreciated.   The restaurant was quiet when we arrived, with only another couple dining. Once we were seated, the waitress brought out a beautiful tray of fruit including chocolate covered strawberries and two small bottles of prosecco, enough for four flutes total. We were floored by the hospitality, and the care and attention that went into our reservation.   We both also thoroughly enjoyed our entrees. My girlfriend had the ribeye and risotto while I had the chicken and whipped potatoes. It was incredibly affordable for the quality of food and it was by far some of the best entrees we've ever had at a restaurant.   We are both incredibly impressed with Libations. The price is great considering the quality of the food, the service was phenomenal and everyone went above and beyond to ensure our experience was exemplary. Cannot recommend it highly enough!"}
