{"text":"There's a part of me that thinks if I'm going to get a classic grilled cheese -- I might as well save the $4 and make it at home. But all of the other menu options make this place very worthy of a visit (or several...) 

You can get a combo that includes classic grilled cheese + tomato soup + drink for $10 or a special sandwich of the day + tater tots + drink for $14. We got one of each and also some Mac and cheese. Oh my the tater tots were so amazing! Both grilled cheese sandwich options were top-notch and the Mac and cheese was delicious (the soup was very good but not something I would personally go out of my way to order again) but we will definitely be back to try other sandwich specials. (In my opinion it's worth it to splurge a bit and get the special sandwich of the day combo since it comes with the tater tots, and the sandwich won't feel too much like something you could have made at home if you weren't feeling lazy.) 

Next time we'll probably get two special combos (it looks like they have two special sandwich options every day) and a small Mac and cheese to share and we'll be rolled out the door as very happy campers."}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to this place last year. 
Great little spot for a solid grilled cheese. 
The Batman and the Royal are definitely my faves.

1 star short of 5/5 because I like my mac and cheese a bit \"saucier\" than they do it, but still pretty good."}
{"text":"Refined casse-croûte in an unpretentious setting.

I had the belly bean poutine ($6) consisting of seasoned potato wedge fries, pork belly, curd, and fèves au lard for the sauce. Great mix of spices in the fries. The few pieces of pork belly were more like jerkey. Substituting fèves au lard for gravy was passable. Together the poutine was heavily on the salty side but there were a lot of flavours going on. In comparison, my friend's mac and cheese was extremely bland. For $6, the belly bean poutine is a worthy attempt to create something unpretentiously different. I'd go for it over fast food poutine any day.

The price is right, and it humbly distinguishes itself from typical casse-croûtes. Worth a try if you're visiting the Monkland village. Takes card payments.

NB: rating based on my poutine only. For me, it's hard for a greasy spoon to get out of the 3-star realm. I'll let my friends review their own dishes."}
{"text":"Very good casse croute to have nearby in NDG. Their grilled cheeses won't disappoint and their tater tots are awesome. Open late to soak up liquor-filled nights."}
{"text":"Cheeseus this place is good !

I was waiting for my friend who was getting a haircut up the street and I decided to spread my wings and check out the neighbourhood. To my surprise LE CHEESE was right on the corner, thank you baby Jesus. I've seen so many pics from Aron G with this soup and curd cheese that's just been lingering in my mind. Without even looking at the menu I ordered the tomato soup and sat down waiting patiently for my soup. When I sat down I noticed the menu on the chalk board right across from me, immediately I started thinking \"did I pick the wrong thing ?\" Because I saw deep fried cheese cake and mac and cheese !!

The soup was great super creamy and not to hot that you can't dive in right away. They put a few flakes of Parmesan, I didn't know the curds you have to add extra  so next time I will make sure to add some. 

Great bunch of guys working there super friendly and a great vibe going on over there. Will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I went with my daughter (a vegetarian).
We were the only customers in there so we were able to sit at a table at a window and watch the world go by while we ate.
She ordered a small poutine, we ordered tater tots to share and I had a Philly steak sandwich.
The small poutine is quite large, very filling with good onion gravy.
The Philly sandwich wasn't quite what I expected but was really good.
The tater tots.....omg, delicious.    Trust me, order some when you're there!"}
{"text":"Le Cheese and their truck are a classic for some cheesy goodness. From classic grilled cheeses to special grilled cheeses like the BATman(bacon, avocado, tomato grilled cheese) there's no wrong choice at Le Cheese. 

Their location is a great spot to visit while walking around the Monkland village(there is a lot of good stuff around the area).

Also be sure to check em out during First Fridays at Parc Olympic where all the food trucks gather on the first Friday of the month!"}
{"text":"I'm always down for grilled cheese and this place is awesome. It's perfect for a late night bite, if only it wasn't so far from where I lived. I got the poutine grilled cheese and the batman (without tomatoes) and woooooooooooooow. I don't know many places that add avocado to a grilled cheese but more places should. Their poutine grilled cheese is also miles ahead of others I've tried. Make sure to get the tomato soup to dip!

They are gooey and warm. Such feel good food. 

They also have an online punch card service which is neat!

My only complaint is the mac and cheese, they make it with peas and cauliflower and I can't get on board with that. Mac and Cheese is sacred to me and messing with it too much is bleh to me.

Worth making the trip!"}
{"text":"Oh Le Cheese... how disappointed I am. I was so excited about #macncheeseweek2018 and invited my cousins & siblings to try this place. I have a long history with Le Cheese having worked on their project for Food Marketing class at JMSB back in 2014, and would rave about it to anyone that would listen.

So imagine my disappointment when I arrive and am met with an ice queen waitress, giving me attitude from the second I say hi. My advice: DON'T WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY IF YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE. She put a damper on our dinner and her behaviour was just so unnecessary. 

To make matters worse, the food came out of the kitchen so slowly. They served all of the food sporadically, with one person getting their food, while 4 others stared and waited what felt like an eternity. 

The flavours of the food were good and everything arrived hot and cheesy. I liked the tater tots, Mac n cheese, philly cheese steak sandwich and burger royale sandwich. But I've definitely had better mac n cheese (not creamy enough and on the bland side).

This review would've been lowered if the the cook hadn't apologized for the wait and tried to redeem the experience at the end by offering us soft drinks and desserts on the house. The dessert was my fave part - those deep fried cheesecake squares with strawberry jam were damn good."}
{"text":"Le Cheese Casee-Croute is a food truck-turned-brick-and-mortar establishment that offers a variety of different types of mac & cheeses, poutines, sandwiches, and tator tots, highlighting local Quebec-ian cheeses.  This place was a little out of the way, but I was determined to stop by while on my trip!  It was freezing, raining, and windy, but I felt victorious, finally making it.  I ordered their famous mac and cheese, which I got it to-go, which came in a small Chinese take-out box - I can hear the guys cooking it up, with some bacon sizzling, with some ingredients being pan-fried, and all the ingredients just coming together.  The macaroni was cooked perfectly al dente - there was so much cheese, but it wasn't salty; the generous amount of bacon gave it that nice salty factor, but just enough to season the mac & cheese perfectly.  There were also roasted cauliflower, sweet green peas, breadcrumbs, some sriracha for a kick, as well as an addition of a homemade bechamel sauce that just made everything come together quite well.  The stop was totally worth it for me, as I love mac and cheese, and I think Le Cheese does it well!  The leftovers even tasted great the next day, so don't fret if you can't finish it (those take-out boxes are deceiving, as a lot can be jampacked in there!).  Staff were super friendly, and there are some seats inside to dine-in.

+mac and cheese :D
+take-out boxes available
+friendly staff"}
{"text":"Cute place. I was honestly expecting way more after reading the reviews. I got a classic grilled cheese and the 1/4lb Mac and cheese. Everything was good but nothing out of the ordinary. I did like the cauliflower touch in the Mac and cheese though. 
Overall, good food but prices are high for what it is. I don't think I would go again! 
(However, the 2 guys working there were very welcoming and nice and the service was quite fast so that's a plus)"}
{"text":"Super cute diner, great vibes, great customer service. The Mac and cheese there is THE Mac and cheese. There is not better Mac and cheese, it is the best Mac and cheese. Get it with bacon. And get the pound.
Also, the deep fried cheesecake is quite heavenly."}
{"text":"Oh my cheese! After a night of hockey and beers there is no better late night snack (open until 4 am) than Le Cheese. The food is a little pricey but it worth it.

Every decadent bite is better than the last. I haven't eaten anything I didn't have to moan after taking my bite. Extra good news the incredible chili is back.

If you happen to stumble upon this hole-in-the-wall gem you must have the Mac and cheese with a delicious grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"This place could and SHOULD be so much better. Small things made it mediocre at best. They served the fries cold which if not for that might have been delicious. I had the philly steak sandwich which was delicious how ever they put lettuce in it when it does not need that at all. The lettuce just got soggy and ruined the sandwich imo.

The tater tots were amazing PERIOD

Now for the reason they lost a couple of stars in my books. The mac and cheese is NOT good! There were frozen peas in it..barely any cheese and it had a weird aftertaste. This is unacceptable for a place that specializes in this. When you have places like dinette triple crown or seasoned dreams serving up top notch mac and cheese. 

I expected this to be so much better and i was disappointed. Based on their prices i expected it to be good and ended up feeling like i over paid. There are restaurants serving amazing food in this price range so you need to step up the quality control.

Mac and cheese is way too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Best tater tots of my life, and really nice guys. Perfect late night food Monkland didn't know it needed."}
{"text":"Friday night 1:00am heading back to my house & I'm starving but don't feel like cooking,what do I do? Get on Yelp & find that Le Cheese is open until 4:00am on Fridays & Saturdays,\"let's do it\" said my beloved. 

It's a quaint clean restaurant with limited seating & jenga is available. I don't care what anyone says because whenever you see jenga there's a challenge that's getting thrown down & I  usually win ;-) Place your order at the counter,pay & they bring it out to you. It's owned by 4 friends that hustle hard & operate their food truck when MTL weather permits it. They are friendly,funny & seem to really enjoy what they do. They have a loyalty points system so you can eventually get some grub at a discount or for free. 

The mac & cheese came highly recommended so I did it with a BATman sandwich & a side of poutine (why the hell not? It's Friday night right?!). I loved the peas & cauliflower in the mac & cheese,they gave it some colour,texture & was quite delicious. The container it's served in while cute is not necessarily practical if you are sharing with someone. Also,when you take the left overs home,it gets clumped into a block of mac & cheese & gets tricky to reheat (first world problems I know). My beloved added caramelized onions & bacon to his & he polished it off quickly.

The BATman was exactly as promised,bacon,avocado & tomatoes,damn it was good but I'm kind so I shared it. Perfectly grilled & smushed (it's a word,look it up). Now on to the poutine,it was salty as hell. I would not get it again,the ratios were perfect but that salt almost killed my tastebuds. 

I'm going back but not on Mondays,they are closed then so pick another day to try it out fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"What can I say about Le Cheese?  Definitely one of my favourite places to go in Montreal.  You can pretty much always find me there on Friday night, around 2 AM (that's still counts as Friday night for me!).  Bonus points for being open until 4 AM on Friday and Saturday nights, all year long!

Ever since I read about Le Cheese last year, I knew we would hit it off, and boy was I right!  Le Cheese, as the name suggests, specializes in cheesy creations.  Grilled cheese sandwiches of every stripe (all excellent), mac and cheese, cheese infused tomato soup (going on my list of best soups in Montreal), poutine (a relatively recent addition, but still awesome), and deep-fried cheesecake!

Many of the menu items are targeted towards omnivorian clientele, however there are plenty of choices for a vegetarian such as myself (even the BATman, Bacon, Avocado, Tomato, which can always be turned into the ATman ;) ).  Just be aware that everything is made on a shared grill, so while your meal can be meat free, there are always some byproducts that get in (grease, fat, oil).

The poutine is made with a veggie-based gravy though, and is delicious!

Located in a quieter part of Monkland, where you can actually find parking sometimes, right next to Shortbread by Gryphon and the Gryphon Tea Room, it's easy to overlook this semi-suburban block, but don't miss out.  Le Cheese is run by some of the nicest guys I know, the effort, commitment, and passion for their work is evident in everything they do.  I always feel at home when I visit."}
{"text":"Monkland Village is home to many restaurants and on June 14th, they welcomed a new addition.  Le Cheese Truck, famous for it's amazing Mac n' Cheese opened its doors at 5976 Monkland Avenue.  They have been featured in MTL Blog as one of the best places to get Mac n' Cheese but they also serve amazing grilled cheese sandwiches, tomato soup, tater tots, philly cheese steak sandwiches and chili with curds.  Le Cheese also offers catering for weddings, events and birthday parties.  For more information, check out their Facebook page here or their official website.  Before Le Cheese moved in to this location, the restaurants that were previously located at this spot did not last very long.  I believe Le Cheese will have much better luck and will be breaking this tradition.  Follow them on Twitter to stay updated and don't forget to like their page!  If you try it out, leave some comments and let me know what you thought!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You can never have too much cheese if you ask me and when you are craving some cheesy goodness look no further than Le Cheese.  This little diner is an ode to all the classic cheesy comfort food of your youth.  If you are in the mood for a classic grilled cheese or mac and cheese just like you used to have as a kid then come here for that fix.

It is located right on Monkland Ave about a 15 minute walk from the Villa Maria metro.  It is on a quieter section of the street so parking should be pretty easy should you drive.  The place is pretty tiny and I could see where on a weekend seating may be hard to come by.  You order at the counter and your food is brought to you when it is ready.  They make it fresh to order so it might take a few minutes but the wait is worth it!

I was starving so I went all out ordering the Cheese Steak in a combo with fries and tomato soup.  I was a little disappointed that there were no tater tots to be seen on the menu especially since other Yelpers have raved so much about them and I was dying for a taste.  This came out to about $19 but it was a ton of food so it was worth the price.

The tomato soup was DA BOMB! It is seriously one of the best tomato soups I have ever tasted.  It had a creamy texture and well balanced flavour.  The philly cheese-steak kind of fell flat for me.  If memory serves me it was supposed to have a jalapeno cheese sauce but for something that supposedly contained hot peppers it didn't have much of a spicy kick to it.  The fries were very well seasoned and they had added rosemary for a little extra flavour which added a nice touch.  I also tried a bit of my friend's Batman grilled cheese sandwich which had cheese, bacon, tomatoes and avocado.  All I can say is holy grilled cheese Batman!  It was pretty good and it made me wish I had gotten that instead of the Philly Cheese Steak.

Le Cheese is awesome and definitely merits more visits to check out what else they have to offer.  For all the cheese fans out there this is definitely the place to come to satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"Not bad but I think my high expectations led me to be disappointed.

I ordered through uber eats after seeing all the great reviews  and got a grilled cheese and the fried cheesecake balls.
Both were fine. The grilled cheese was nothing special. I was expecting more from it. 
The fried cheesecake balls were decadent, though the portion was tiny. The strawberry sauce it comes with is very yummy. For 6$, they give three balls. One of mine was 70% breading and was tiny so that was pretty disappointing. 

I would try it again but probably only at the restaurant because I feel like greasy comfort food doesn't hold up well for delivery.

Food:3.5/5
Value:3/5"}
{"text":"Great friendly service, the food was delecious. I tried the Batman grilled cheese with added caramelised onions and mac and cheese which was made with peas and cauliflower. Even though tasted good, it was kind of like the ones you make at home your self. Didn't feel anything special. I have tried grilled cheese in quite a few places and this one fell quite low on the best list. The mac and cheese had bits of pasta which were almost burnt, didn't have enough sauce to make it a mac and cheese and i didn't taste the cauliflower at all. It was a very clean restaurant and i really liked the service. But for spending $17 for a grilled cheese sandwich meal, it was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"They serve melted cheese on buttery bread and play roots reggae in the diner. I'm sold.

The place is small and casual but well designed with a cute vibe. The menu changes all the time but obviously consists mostly of variations on grilled cheese. Some funky ones I've tried include: burrito grilled cheese, pesto grilled cheese, and drumroll...poutine grilled cheese. 

So if you're looking for a quick, casual meal or a naughty snack this side of Decarie, Le Cheese is the place to be."}
{"text":"Nice little hippy looking place, with jenga blocs. 

I ordered their 1 lb Mac 'N Cheese for 15$. 
Alright, I was expecting a lot more from a restaurant that serves every item on the menu with cheese. Except...The macaroni was cooked al dente, which is probably the only positive thing I can say about the plate.

In terms of presentation, it looked like a mess, as it came in a cardboard box, so the browned cheese was found in lumps here and there instead of covering the pasta/cheese mix. 

In terms of ingredients, other than the cheddar cheese (I presume) and macaroni, it contained cauliflower and green peas. I'm not sure where they got the idea that cauliflower and green peas would add, in any way, to the classic dish. It might look a little more pleasant, but you know green peas and cauliflower don't taste much right? 

Whatever their reason, the Mac N Cheese I had probably tasted as good as the cardboard box that contained it. It lacked so much in flavor that even salt, pepper, and their spicy mayo couldn't save it. For this dish, I'm giving it a generous 2/5.

However, thank the Lord my friends ordered different items on the menu, including a 6$ (so much more affordable) poutine, which was decadent (see Tony Kangrui L's review), but a bit too salty apparently.

What they call tater tots is actually breaded (with mashed potato powder, I suspect) mash, heavy on the cheddar, which tasted very nice next to my whole pound of cardboard-style Mac N Cheese, with green peas and cauliflower.

So taking everything into account, I'll rate this an overall 3/5. 

tl;dr: DONT TAKE THE MAC N CHEESE!!"}
