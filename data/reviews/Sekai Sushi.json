{"text":"I've been to Sekai a countless number of times, but I have to admit that it's not necessarily my all-time favorite.  The quality of their fish is always great and their wait staff is usually fast and friendly - but their all around quality/quantity of their rolls and meals goes back and forth - sometimes it's great, sometimes not so much.

However, I will admit that it's probably one of the best sushi places in Mesa - so if you're looking for a place in the vicinity, Sekai is likely your best bet."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I have my boyfriend to thank for finding this place. He's been going here for a long time. Now, I love it. Solid sushi for decent prices. Plus the staff is pretty friendly. 

I've had the katsu in the dinner combination before. It's tasty and you get lots of food (salad, miso soup, rice, etc.).

But really the fish is what we go here for. The pieces are huge and fresh. Tuna, eel and salmon nigiri are my favorites. They serve the salmon with lemon and it really adds something. My other favorite thing is the fresh oysters. They don't always have them, but when they do you're in for a treat. They're huge and minimally prepared with green onions, tobiko (flying fish roe), lemon and sriracha sauce. 

They also have a decent selection of rolls that are good. We like to ask for tobiko on top of the Cali roll - yum.

Overall it's just a great value - some of the tastiest sushi I've had in the Phoenix area in a nice, non-pretentious restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been going to Sekai for eight years or so -- ever since a friend who used to live in Japan recommended it. It's a great place to get your sushi on without breaking the bank -- provided (as another reviewer pointed out) your tastes aren't too exotic. We always order at least one chef-recommended special, and you can't go wrong with the sushi boat. The miso soup (with extra tofu for me) is a fave, as is the edamame. 

The decor is in need of some serious \"rate my space\" help, and the karaoke videos on continuous loop are sooo bad, they're almost, er, good.

Friendly owner, staff and sushi chef(s). Hardly ever a wait. A good, solid local choice."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say people of Mesa you must have pretty low standards if this is the best sushi bar in Mesa. I went there last night and I really did not think it was that great. How can anyone say great service when the servers cannot tell you the different sakes they stock. One of the servers barely spoke any English. Another one went to get my soup bowl and reached across me without asking if it was okay to do so. 

The Uni was actually pretty good but really was not impressed with the tempura. The Hamachi was served with skin on it which I really do not like. I do not see what is so special about the Miso"}
{"text":"Nice employees! We called and ordered two custom rolls about 20 minutes before closing. By the time w got there, everything was ready to go. They were cleaning the dining room and sushi counter and everything was clean and smelled nice. They also did not seem irritated at the fact that I ordered food right before closing! Sushi was great! I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been going to this sushi place for years.  It is easily the best, locally owned, sushi place in Mesa.  It's in a large 20+year old strip mall and Sekai just recently celebrated their 10th anniversary.  Which shows you that they have a good base of fans to support their culinary efforts.  It's not the typical hip happening sushi joint of today's golden sushi bar age.  But that's just fine with me.  The TVs with the karaoke music does get a bit old, but that not why I eat here.  The owner is always there and she is very welcoming and nice.  She is a jack-of-all trades as well and I've seen her backing up the sushi chefs, waiting tables and running food.

They do enough business to keep the fish fresh and prices down which makes for a very good meal at what I consider value sushi prices.  Everything I have tried, which is just about all of it has been as good if not better than other more hyped sushi joints around town.
We make regular Friday night visits and it is a good place to meet up with our extended local family.  So, its great for groups. But call ahead on Fri-Sat to ensure you can get a large enough table.
Favorites here are the Sushi Boat ($35) which has 4 rolls and a good selection of nigiri sushi making this the best value on the menu.  All the standards are excellent (hamachi, maguro, tako, etc.).  The spicy tuna handroll doesn't disappoint.
Other non-sushi favorites include the Mackerel is wonderful and we have enjoyed the udon, gyoza and tempura.  Don't forget the edamame.

They have a full bar offering but I have never ordered a cocktail here.  Only beer and sake.  Good selection of Japanese bottles and they stock my favorite (Asahi Extra Dry).

I'm all about the locally owned especially when it can compete and beat the chains.  Forget about the new Ra sushi on Val Vista and give this one a try. 

Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my 4th visit with different friends of mine. I always enjoy the main dish with various fresh vegetables and sushi along with rice. Unfortunately I don't remember the name but I think it is a Korean style of dish. (In Korean it is Hyedup bap? ) My friends loved it too. For me, it is always fresh and delicious. The chef really knows how to maintain the same taste without fluctuation. Very good and impressive.
Also I tried jjampong for the first time here. It was really really good too! Very yummy. I will come again when I visit Mesa or Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Was not really impressed with their sushi. I did like that it was a sushi bar and restaurant, apparently there are not that many in the Mesa area. Sushi was plain and the presentation was nothing spectacular. Also it didn't taste better than costco sushi"}
{"text":"Sekai has great service. My friends and I were there for a birthday dinner. The sushi was great. We ordered the sushi boat to be split by 3 people and could not finish it. The atmosphere was quiet and pleasant even though we were a loud and noisy birthday crowd that included children."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite sushi spot in Arizona.  My mother and I have been coming here for over 9 years. The owner is very friendly and always remembers us. Try the Phoenix Roll it's the best!"}
{"text":"I always eat here when I'm in town.  Super friendly staff and great food.  For lunch, I usually order a tempura roll and spicy Tina roll and they're always fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and service! We (my husband and I) have been going to Sekia almost since it opened, it is a must if you want really good sushi. Peter the chef is terrific and the owner is sweet and very nice! Love the place and we have had sushi all over the USA. This is the best in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! My boyfriend found it driving by and took me there tonight. The staff is very friendly and the sushi is AMAZING!! Very fresh tasting, a great variety of rolls and specials and all for a very reasonable price. Before leaving we found out they have been in business for 17 years from regulars that have been going since they opened. I love that we were able to not only have great food but also support a local family run business in the process! Highly recommend this restaurant. Best sushi in the East Valley for sure and probably the Valley!!"}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our food. Food was good but waiting over an hour was ridiculous. It also wasn't busy. Only 4 tables. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food was good, however there were only 2 other tables of couples and it took 45 mins to get our food. While we were waiting we were completely ignored. I had to get up and go to the cash register to ask for a drink refill. Liked the food but won't be going back."}
{"text":"Sekai is my regular sushi restaurant. I love all the sushi I've never ordered something I didn't like. The las Vegas roll is my fav! They give you a hot towel for your hands before you eat, and miso soup is free of charge... I think it should just come with the meal at every sushi restaurant. : ) Service is good but we usually have to wait a little for our check. You should def try it out if you're looking for a good sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Owners are Korean, so go with someone who speaks Korean and you'll be \"in.\" Even if not, this is the best sushi you'll find in the area. 

The location is a little bit tucked away in the mall. As for the special from the owner and see what they can make you. It's always creative. Service may be a bit slow but the quality is amazing."}
{"text":"Ramen is great, specially for a sushi place. I don't like sushi much so I got the ramen, it was great, not too many vegtables, more noodles and broth to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the staff is very friendly! I went with my 3 year old, and the waitress brought her a bowl of miso soup for free- so nice and she loved it! I had veggie tempura and vegetarian sushi, both were delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! I try to come here as often as I can. Great sushi and great service. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Sekai for years. We haven't been going as often since we moved out to Tempe, but we try to stop in once a month or so. Moon, the owner, is as sweet as pie and always tells us to \"Enjoy dinner!\". The baked green mussels are yummy, and so is the squid salad. For sushi rolls, you can't go wrong with the Killer Roll (eel roll topped with salmon, drizzled with eel sauce) and the Phoenix Roll (Crab mix, cream cheese, salmon, and some others deep fried). If they're not on the menu, write them down on the bottom, and you'll get them. The sushi chefs are always friendly and have been more than happy to make a custom roll for me (salmon and yellowtail is pretty good, as is unagi and yellowtail). I'm probably one of the very few who adores the cheesy karaoke videos and music that play."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years. Its a great place for lunch or dinner. Sushi is fresh and beautiful. Tempura is outstanding. Teriyaki is fair.
Lots of good deals on lunch specials. Just had a sushi combo with salmon roll,tuna roll and CA roll. Way too much to finish for $8.95. Made two meals at least for me!"}
{"text":"I usually go by Yelp recommendations for new places to eat. I saw this place had good reviews, but man, this place really put a sour taste in my mouth. 

It was only about a few tables busy. In a party of about five people, the server was able to take our orders promptly. In about ten mins everyone but my one friend DIDNT EVEN GET ANY FOOD!! We waited and waited. Everyone was about finished before we had to literally wave our arms in the air for a server. She forgot to take his order. She ran into the kitchen then in five mins he had his tiny Unagi Don. Poor guy was so tired of waiting. 

Another server was taking our dishes and kind of rushing. She leaned across the table for my plate and SPILLED AN ENTIRE GLASS OF WATER ONTO ME. She quickly said sorry but not very sincerely. 

After about an hour everyone was pretty disappointed by the service and the food wasn't as good to make up for it. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Today, along my cycling journey, I found a delicious, wonderful and super cheap sushi lunch special.  The food was amazing, service was great and the price was even better.  I had the $5.95 spicy chicken lunch special and the crazy fire dynamite roll.  For my full review of Sekai Sushi please visit my blog at azspicycycler.com.  Also follow me on Instagram and Twitter @azspicycycler.  Thanks for the support and make sure to try out Sekai Sushi."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place and would recommend starting with gyoza and getting the cucumber roll and crab sashimi. This is the best Japanese place I've been to. The wait is a bit long but totally worth it once the rice and seaweed goodness arrive to your plate"}
{"text":"My father and i come here every month for dinner. The staff is great and friendly and it is nice and quiet and cozy. Prices are very good and always get great sushi. The Deluxe boat and Las Vegas roll are just perfect to split."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Japanese food. The prices are reasonable, the service is great and the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to sushi, I don't eat anything that has fish. I stick to crab and shrimp. I've never had a problem with having options at other places, but this place didn't have many options. They were also very plain tasting. I can't speak for any of the fish sushi, but this isn't the place for me"}
{"text":"Friendly service and fantastic sushi! Ordered the California rolls with egg rolls, and they were amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was eager to try a place for sushi tonight and after reading the reviews though I would give this place a chance. It was a huge disappointment. When I sat at the sushi bar  there was no sushi chef and the waitress immediately came up to me and asked me what I wanted to drink before even handing me a menu. When I requested one she  finally understood what I meant and came back a few minutes later with one. . I made a decision right away and put my menu down but she did not come back for 5 minutes and kept talking to a  coworker.  Considering I was the only person other than one other table of 4, I was getting a little upset at how ignored I was being treated. When she did arrive I finally got to place an order for Ice tea. The chef eventually came out from behind the curtain and after I was able to place an order for my sushi he was very quick to serve me. When I sat down I was very skeptical of this sushi since the fish under the glass looked old quit old. The only sushi i had that night that was good were the salmon and tuna Nigiri. I I also ordered a tempura roll and soft shell crab roll. The soft shell crab was very good however the rice was justto sticky and would not hold the roll together well. I could not pick it up with my chop sticks with out the pieces breaking up so I had to use my hands and the rice just stuck to them and I had to deal with sticky fingers all night. I then ordered their house specially roll with was truly the worst thing I have ever had for $10  It was some imitation crab with a spicy tuna topping and a little salmon roe. Not cold and more  luke warm which never makes me feel good when I have sushi. After finishing my meal my waitress who never came up to see if I was doing OK once during my dinner was in the corner of the restaurant (about 15 feel away) helping some two people saw a piece of wood. I had to request my check from the chef who finally got her attention. When my bill came I was shocked. $35 for Ice tea. 2 Nigiri sushi orders (2 pieces each) 3 rolls. 

The reviews on this site are so old and I hate to say maybe biased  because this place was not in good shape. Based on the vacancies in the complex and the number of people in the restaurant I don't give this place another 6 months."}
{"text":"Had my first sushi here in the early 90's. I still come back any time I want sushi - they are just THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Slightly more than what I spend at my old favorite sushi place, but food/service are way better and very consistent."}
{"text":"Sushi is amazing! They have great lunch specials.  Everyone is very nice and super helpful"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in, this restaurant is clean and odorless (a good thing for a sushi restaurant).

The prices are very reasonable for the caliber of artistry in their rolls. The \"Special\" is an off menu item that was created on the fly by Inoh, the young sushi chef. 

We always get the oysters, when they have them. It depends on the quality of the shipment; they have refused to accept deliveries in the past.  The oysters are amazing. 

This is a fantastic sushi place. I rank it up there with the Sushi Den in Denver (look it up! Definitely worth a visit if you are ever in Denver).

I've had sushi at over 70 places across the valley. This has been the most consistent, inventive place I've been to."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here today because I was wanting something different then the usual by my work. Literally the BEST and most fresh tasting sushi I've had. The customer service was also amazing. I can't remember the name of my waitress but was so friendly and helpful. She recommended the Canyon State roll so I decided to try it out. It was delicious! I also had a couple of my favorites that I almost always get, salmon and yellowtail nigiri and you can tell the fish is so fresh. Highly recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Az I have found. We come here weekly and the food and service is always amazing! The sushi is always fresh and yummy. The chef and waitress are always so friendly."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great Korean and Japanese food, which is rare at a sushi place. The ramen and bimbimbap were very good. The service is very friendly. I like a place we're they really remember you and remember what you ordered last time."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to get sushi. Hands down one of the best. We also LOVE the staff. Always friendly, never had an issue. They have these new sushi items there now and I had one that wasn't very good but that was my own taste buds fault haha. I will keep going here again and again."}
{"text":"Any time me and my wife can have a date night, this is the place to be. Best Sushi by far. Very clean, great customer service all the staff our very friendly, making you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Quick service and delicious food! Can't beat that! Also quaint little place with pretty authentic Japanese decor. Wished they played Japanese music tho instead of top 10 R&B - it would really transform the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"I've always had a good sushi experience when eating here, though I'm not a sushi expert by any means, and it's possible that I'm slightly biased because I'm just so happy that there is a respectable sushi place in Mesa! In any case, I've always enjoyed my sushi experience here, that's a fact."}
{"text":"Was there on Mother's Day and saw signs for happy hour. Asked the server and she said \"not today.\" Okay, maybe not on Sundays I thought. As we received our check I noticed other signs that promoted happy hour \"3-6, monday thru sunday, all week.\" Asked another server who was unsure. She inquired with the original server who informed her she already told us \"not today because of the holiday\" (she had not originally told us it was due to the holiday). No signage informed patrons that holidays were excluded and we were charged normal prices. Emailed the business in hopes that they'd give us an apology but received a b.s. response as to what happened. I live around the corner and visit this place often with my family. Probably won't return. If there are no stipulations on the advertisement, the special should be honored."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and it is CONSISTENTLY good. That is a mark of a well run and good establishment. The sushi is fresh and everything has always been delicious and well made. Good lunch specials and friendly and fast service. Clean and pleasant atmosphere.
Always leave here feeling pleased."}
{"text":"Love this place great sushi and great customer service! Yummy miso soup! Very attentive staff. Didn't have to ask for anything."}
{"text":"Love this place, been coming here for years. Food is fabulous and the price is right. We've actually gotten to know Moon, who now gives us hugs when we walk in the door."}
{"text":"I took the family here for dinner and at 5:30, there's already a few regulars inside the restaurant. We placed our drinks and appetizer orders and we were extremely pleased with the fast service. My daughter and I shared the sushi boat order and we were stuffed and there's plenty more for our take home box. We got a friendly hug from the owner who came to check up on our dining experience and she also personally helped us box our left overs. ( there's tons of good) our total bill is reasonable for 4 adult entree, a beer and two appetizers. We will come back to this restaurant !"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we just caught them on a bad night or what; service was HORRIBLE!! Food was good so I am willing to give them another chance, I hope they can live up to their four star rating."}
{"text":"Best sushi in AZ. Had a conversation with Josh the sushi chef while eating and it was a good time"}
{"text":"I've been goin here off and on for years thru 2 different owners.  It's just kinda far, but the drive is worth it just for 1 of their baked mussels.  Fresh sushi and katsu.  What else do u want?"}
{"text":"Love this Place!!! The chef really knows what he is doing. It is always a hit every time I go there.  I truly love this place it is a great place for sushi! The Miso soup is awesome, my daughter sometimes can not get enough of it, I will admit sometimes neither can I."}
{"text":"Went in for a couple rolls and the restaurant was so hot I had to take my order to go. 

Took the one sushi guy 40 minutes to get the first roll out to me and there were only 3 tables. 

It wasn't comfortable to eat in the restaurant being close to 83 degrees inside and this was in December."}
{"text":"This is not good sushi, do not waste your time or money. I am a sushi fanatic and this can not even be classified as mediocre."}
{"text":"Best Sushi Hands DOWN!!!! Staff are extremely sweet!!! Fast and friendly!!! I've been to many sushi places and none compare to this one!"}
{"text":"Great good. Poor service. We sat outside and the waitress had 3 tables on the inside. Had to go in to get my drinks and order my food. It's 76degrees outside beautiful. So no reason for her to not want to come outside. She forgot half our meal as well."}
{"text":"Josh (owner and proprietor) is amazeballs!  Great food, good drinks and awesome atmosphere.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love love the sushi here. Been here many of time and get great service and food. Fast and on top of getting orders out. Thanks.."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Arizona! The staff is very very friendly and the sushi chefs make the greatest rolls known to man! Love it! If I could rate it higher than 5 stars...I would!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. The rolls are colossal. The bites were so big they need to cut the rolls in half longways. Good rice for good price. You defiantly get a lot of food for the price. Good atmosphere. Good food. Had spicy mussels that were delish. Come hungry leave happy."}
{"text":"I love sushi and I love this quaint tiny little place!  Although I haven't been here in quite some time I drove by this place the other day and thought of all the good memories I have had there and wanted to go in but I was on my way someplace so it was a disappointment that I couldn't stop and schoff down some delicous sushi.  What I really love about this place in the intimacy and you never feel intimidated while eating there.  For instance whenever I go to RA I feel as though I have a certain image to be even looked at in there.  That isn't so at Sekai.  The staff is there to provide you with the best meal possible and they always took the time to answer questions that may arrise.  That cannot be overlooked by anymeans.  This place is definitely good for groups and even a first date, I would say if you want to keep it low key.
   With all that said, the prices are right, the sushi is delicious and the atmosphere is great.  I need to go back there again soon, real soon."}
{"text":"This place is a very nice mom and pop sushi restaurant. It's clean, authentic and very accommodating and romantic. Highly recommend for anyone with the love of sushi."}
{"text":"Great dinner with hubby last night!!  Sushi Chef Nick took great care of us and supplied fantastic food!!  Had oyster and quail egg shooters to die for, baked mussels with a hand carved cucumber whale, soft shell crab and salmon belly.  This place always has the freshest sushi at a great price.  Very comfortable atmosphere, always enjoyable!  So lucky to have this in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Mesa... hands down. I've been to nearly all of them and this is the only one I will go back to. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu; however, I like the Vegas Roll and the Dragon Roll.

This is where I'm having my birthday party!"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is close to my new house but I have been coming here off and on for years. Back when I wanted to explore all sushi restaurants in Arizona to pick the best, this place was always at the top of my list. I always refer to Moon, a lady who I think is the owner, as my Japanese mother because she did a lot to make me feel warm, welcome, and loved.

While I don't see Moon much anymore, the atmosphere of that feeling still exists. The people are warm and inviting, although sometimes I wish there were more waiters (you will often be waiting for a seat, a menu, someone to take your order). While this is not overwhelming, it is noticeable. Have yourself some saké (they have a large selection but my favorite has always been Sho Chiku Bai Nigori saké) and deal with it, though. Let yourself unwind from the day and stop being so uptight. Just chill and soak up some atmosphere (the restaurant is beautifully decorated and it has actually opened up in years since I first came here.).

They bring you out miso soup (seaweed and tofu with green onions). If you love miso soup, this is the best from all sushi restaurants I have visited in The Valley. It's flavorful and not too salty (which is a problem a lot of miso soups have). It is not overrun with seaweed or tofu. It's perfect.

In this order I ordered ebi tempura (battered shrimp - see attached picture). The sauce to dip it in is a light soy based (again not too salty) sauce. Honestly, I found myself loving the tempura so much, I rarely used the dip. The shrimp is tender and delicious and the tempura only serves to highlight this. It is also the best tempura I have had in The Valley (did I mention I go to a lot of sushi places?). I'm also quite particular with batter and tempura specifically because it's hard to get it just right. Sometimes it's over-cooked or under-cooked and leaves a lingering aftertaste. That's not the case with this tempura. It's light and literally melts in your mouth. I loved it.

Finally, I order the 911 roll (see attached photo) as my piece  d'resistance. I typically like my sushi rolls fresh with no mayo or sauce or extraneous crap that detracts from the flavor of fish. The chef does a wonderful job of melding the flavors of each fish (tuna, salmon, yellow tail, white fish, crab stick, and shrimp) with the avocado, green onions, and masago (fish eggs). I think that the masago is a bit sparse on this roll for my taste. I feel like more masago would have punched up this roll a bit. Overall, the roll is fresh, not too fishy, covered in ponzu, the flower is actually edible (you should eat it! It's really delicious!), and leaves you happy with your eyes rolling into the back of your head if you are a seafood lover like I am. 

I would recommend Sekai Sushi wholeheartedly. I would consider it a diamond in the rough and something you should include in your sushi repertoire."}
{"text":"Loved the happy hour! Tried the chicken and some veggie rolls and tempura. All of it was so tasty"}
{"text":"Excellent! Quality sushi, great service, reasonable prices! We shared a tempura bento box, Las Vegas roll and a Super Tiger roll. Loved the food and spent less than $25!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for sushi. It is affordable, the staff is wonderful and it's delicious. We're always really happy with what we order when we come in."}
{"text":"Great service, no rush, sushi came out at the right intervals making sure everyone had food.  Large portions of fish (as always) and no problem customizing your rolls. Been visiting this location for a very long time fish is fresh with great color. We will continue to come back for our sushi needs. Nice birthday deep fried tempura touch at the end."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally found a sushi place close to where we live that we would give a try.  We have been to many places. The waiting staff is okay. Some of the sushi was alright. We found a couple we enjoyed which was the Shrimp Tempura and the Las Vegas Roll. I wouldn't say the salmon roll and california roll are worth ordering again. I didn't care for the miso soup but I am not a miso soup fan. It's okay but we will be back for the rolls we enjoyed."}
{"text":"Tasty! The atmosphere was astounding! The food was more than filling. Friendly staff and very low key! If you're looking for a hole in the wall kind of establishment then this is the joint for you!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy ninja roll for the tenth time in as many visits tonight. All were top shelf!!! Damn!!!"}
{"text":"Went again last week with my wife.  She had their shrimp tempura and beef teriyaki combo lunch and I had their Korean rice bowl with various sashimi pieces and veggies -- very good.  The owner, who is Korean, also told me that I can order some Korean dishes the next time and if they have the ingredients, she would make them for me.  I thought that this was nice and I appreciated her willingness to satisfy my craving for some hard to find Korean dishes.  We still like this place."}
{"text":"Hidden in a large but rather dead plaza, Sekai is never very busy.  For this reason, I enjoy the relaxing and quiet experience.  The servers are always very nice too.  They have some good-priced noodle dishes which I've only tried the curry udon and it was decent.  Tonight we came early and got excited when we realized there was happy hour.  Too bad the happy hour menu turned out to have very few rolls and none were good ones.  I ordered mostly basic rolls from the regular menu - yellowtail roll, spicy scallops roll, octopus roll, and spicy tuna roll.  The yellowtail was the best and the fish tasted fresh and so naturally buttery.  I was excited they had an octopus roll.  Don't think I've seen other places offer that in roll form.  My husband ordered a special roll (don't remember name) but it had spicy tuna inside and seared salmon on top with mayo, eel sauce, masago, and onions.  It was pretty good and very soft (in a good way).  Overall, a good close by place for us to enjoy a quiet night out."}
{"text":"best sushi in the east valley. quality rolls, rolls are a really good size. the nigiri is thick not skimpy."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Sekai for a couple years now and we absolutely love it. This is the only place we come for sushi! The staff is always friendly, the food is delicious, and it's a peaceful environment for any meal. Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Sekai on the recommendations here on Yelp. At the time it was the highest average rating for Sushi in Mesa. The staff was courteous and extremely pleasant. The food arrived in just a few quick minutes (less than 10). Then that is where the good remarks end. We ordered the Tuna, Yellowtail, Tempura, and Salmon sushi rolls. Let's just say the Yellowtail almost made both of us sick. The Tuna was not much better, it tasted like very poor quality or old Tuna. The Salmon roll was OK and the Tempura was the best of the four.  However, all where average to poor. I mentioned the issue with the Yellowtail to the waitress and they offered to make it right which was good service but it doesn't make up for the substandard sushi. Me and probably my companion will never go back again."}
{"text":"Im not sure how this place is still in business but I am glad it is!!! Some of the best sushi in town! The price and service are equally amazing!"}
{"text":"Top notch sushi, this place is really delicious they only use the freshest ingredients and you can tell, doesn't miss a beat, everything is good !"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite place. Great miso soup. 

It's actually not quite as good as it used to be before a few important chef changes. But still a 5 since there's been a thread of continuity through the changes.

Try: the baked scallops on top of the California roll

Try: the sunomono (plain or with crab)

Try: the Tamago nigiri (I like it with a little eel sauce on it as dessert)

Nice staff. Fun regulars. Large pieces of what's usually small at other places."}
{"text":"One of the best in the entire valley & affordable too.  Consistent as well!  We live further north in AZ, but make it a point to stop here when in the area--I have yet to have a negative experience here."}
{"text":"I've been to sekai's 5 or 6 times. The food is good but the service is lacking. Tonight my mother in law had to send back 2 orders that wasn't her's and then the waitress proceeded to argue with her about what the menu said. That's why I only give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite spot !! Sushi is amazing and you can sit at the bar and interact with the chefs! Come down here! You're missing it!"}
{"text":"I have eat here many times before, the sushi is very low priced. I have had some good experiences their , but this last time was horrible all the Sushi was disgusting ! I had about 3 rolls ,one roll off each plate and I could not eat any more! I went home puked  my brains out! It was not even edible.. Ya its only 7 bucks a roll.. But their is no quilty!! You pay for what you get!! And sometimes if your their when the fish is fresh is great but they don't go thru as much fish say as raw.. So it's a hit or miss... I will never go their again ! Spend the extra 15 bucks and go somewhere good! this place sucks will not suggest to anyone!"}
{"text":"Sekai is always our go-to sushi restaurant...they have a great atmosphere, great service and we never have any difficulty with our 3 little ones. The food is always great too! My personal favorite is the ramen...and now the lunch special ramen with nigiri...so good! Definitely worth a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to mention that sekai does, in fact, have a modest liquor selection. It's not just beer and wine."}
{"text":"The best sushi in the Mesa, Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Finally made another visit to this strip mall jewel. It's tucked in the back and never looks too busy but it should be because it's delicious! Must GO! Went for happy hour with 2 kids. Friendly smiling servers greeted us and we were sat promptly. We ordered off the happy hour menu. Philly roll, shrimp tempura roll, avocado roll and tuna roll along with salmon nigiri and gyoza. All the rolls were made quickly and tasted super fresh. The salmon and tuna were yummy, fresh not fishy. The shrimp tempura roll was so big! And they were super generous with the avocado in the avocado roll, fresh green large chunks of avocado. Gyoza, tasted great and perfectly pan fried. Complimentary miso to boot! Great sushi at a sweet little place with friendly people and servers . Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Yet another one of my regular stops. Always a calm and relaxing environment. The decor is quaint and really cozy, lighting is low. (I'm not a realtor, I swear)
I have only ever ordered Nigiri and Maki and have never disappointed. My man prefers cooked food so he always gets the chicken katsu. I have had some of his and it is just as delicious as the kind I grew up eating. I absolutely recommend Sekai, especially to anyone who prefers to enjoy sushi in peace. 
Oh and the price is nice!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1998 and excellent food and friendly staff and funny chef!!"}
{"text":"Had 33 pieces of all-you-can-eat sushi. Fish cuts either tasted pretty average or not so fresh."}
{"text":"I came back in June.  The usual chef was not there.  The new chef is not speaking English very well.  And his creation is not as decorative as other chefs before.
Price is up.  I guess to cover the lack of customers in the summer time.
it is alright at best."}
{"text":"Really good! I have been looking for a sushi place near me for a while! This place is really good all around. I had sushi rolls and the yakisoba. The sushi was really fresh and the noodles were perfect! The staff was very nice. It is a little hidden but that kind of adds to the atmosphere. Highly recommended will 100% be back."}
{"text":"Five of us visited Sekai Sushi for dinner. None of us ordered sushi. It took a looong time for our orders to arrive.  My dish was the tempura variety: shrimp and vegetables tempura with miso soup, salad and rice.  The miso soup was average, the salad had a spicy hot dressing on a cumber slice with iceberg lettuce that was so-so. The tempura batter was thick and crunchy instead of light and crisp plus it was oily.  My wife was surprised to find the ramen noodles to be spicy. No one was complementary about their meal."}
{"text":"This place is great and not too expensive. Las Vegas rolls are awesome. Had to grab a couple to go on the way home tonight."}
{"text":"Update: 
I'm almost certain I have food poisoning from this place. Everything else I've eaten recently is stuff I've had before. I believe it was my curry since my girlfriend is fine.

Original review:
My girlfriend recently started working near here and we saw the yelp reviews so we figured we would give it a try. We think Ra is too expensive for what you, kona grill isn't great. Our usual eats are Sakana for more traditional rolls and Blue Wasabi for sushi & drinks.

The menu looked like it had several great options. We decided that we would get 2 sushi rolls as well as an entrée each. I got the pork katsu curry and she got the tempura prawn noodles. We ordered the Las Vegas roll and the caterpillar roll.

Our appetizer of tempura calimari was good though it used a fried batter that you would expect for onion rings. It was good but different.

Then came the sushi. The Vegas roll was drenched in soy sauce. I don't think there was anything else I could taste. I was very disappointed. the caterpillar roll tasted so bland. And shortly afterwards my stomach felt queezy. 

Her noodles weren't bad but my curry was pretty bland. Nothing special.

Also my green tea was pretty tasteless.

On top of all of this it took us forever to get our check. Our waitress just disappeared. There were only 3 other people in the restaurant and you'd think they could help us out...Probably never going here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here a lot..They greet you as soon as you walk in.. The food portion is very good.. The prices are good.. The owner came to our table and made sure we ok..this is the best place in Mesa!!"}
{"text":"Very calm place to eat sushi. The owner, moon, is very kind and helps out with what ever is needed. She greats you when you come in, with a smile. The sushi is very good and The atmosphere is welcoming. 

The down side. It takes two hours to fully complete your meal from drinks to the end. The servers take so long to get back to you and the food takes almost a half an hour to get to your table. Eat here if you have time on your hands or have plenty of time to waste."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place EVER. Sushi is always cold and is always great. We usually get served by Kim and she goes above and beyond for us every time. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Sushi but I have eaten here a few times. I really like the decor and the whole atmophere of this place. Every time I have eaten there the staff have been great and the food as well. I would recommend Sekai to anyone who loves sushi and wants a less corporate / cookie cutter sushi experience."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! We have been going here for years and the sushi is fantastic. The portions for the price are very reasonable!!! We can typically be in and out within 45 min which is great because we always bring our 2 year old with and that's about his time limit for good behavior. They also bring out miso soup with rice for him which he loves. Their lunch specials are really good too!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been looking for a good sushi place in the area for a while since we moved from CA, and I have to say that I think we finally found our place. They have great customer service, as soon as we walked through the door the staff was very attentive, and asked us if we had been there before, she walked us through their menu, and their lunch special, which was super delicious, and the portions and variety was pretty abundant. My hubby and I had the teriyaki grilled salmon, the lunch special also includes miso soup, white rice, salad and gyoza. The Salmon was very tender, yet had a perfect, grilled skin. We also had their salmon and albacore rolls which were very fresh and tasty! And for dessert we had the tempura ice cream. Besides the great food and customer service, another thing that is extremely important to mention is the cleanliness of the restaurant and the restrooms were impeccable, the atmosphere feels very romantic and relaxing which I also enjoyed. Despite the fact that we live in Gilbert, this place is definitely worth the drive! Another plus: this place also has happy hour every day from 3-6 !"}
{"text":"Not very exciting, my second try to get here , the first time they were closed. Now I come and the sushi chef is not that friendly, charged me more for a very minor request and wasn't super friendly, when i ask him to pick a roll for me to enjoy he did  not . Probably Not Coming Back !"}
{"text":"Very classy and clean facility.
Relaxed and no rush atmosphere.
Food and preparation ecxellent.
Strongly recommend this sushi restaurant.
Friendly and knowledgeable staff.
Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in all of Metro Phoenix. Hands down. Odd location, but it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"As they are closing and I'm sitting in the establishment, I'll keep this brief. You want to come here. You want to order a roll (I suggest the spicy tuna and California rolls), get the gyoza, and order a bowl of Chashu Ramen.

Why am I so specific? Because it is exaclty what i ordered and it is fabulous. Everything was on point and achingly good. Hell, even the staff were on their A game. They were friendly, attentive and very quick to help. 

All in all, I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place with great service always friendly people and great food at a great cost it's great we love the Chef Nick"}
{"text":"Went for my second time this weekend, but not because the first time was good and I wanted to go back - someone else chose. 

The first time I had the ramen and it wasn't very good. I remember having left sort of let down and still hungry because I didn't want to finish what I ordered. This time I went with sushi. I got the dragon roll, spicy tuna and eel w/avocado. I'm no sushi expert, but I wasn't terribly impressed. The dragon roll was the best of the three, mostly because it was large and fried. It was all just alright. I've had better."}
{"text":"We'll let me start off my saying the table we were seated at looked dirty.  The sushi itself was pretty good..we ordered a dragon roll, spicy tuna and cali... I also got the mackerel which was nothing special and my fiancé ordered their ramen which was a total joke...straight out of a package with no toppings not at all tradition Japanese ramen."}
{"text":"Welcoming atmosphere but didn't enjoy the sushi here that much! I've had better for way cheaper. First and last time here. I'd rather go to Tempura Sushi Bar instead."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite sushi restaurant. They catered to my young kids and we're very grateful. The servers were pleasant and friendly. I would recommend Sekai for anyone looking for great sushi and great service."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, great atmosphere. Friendly staff. John at the sushi bar will take special requests including \"how spicy do you want your spicy yellow tail\". A refreshing break from the canned chain sushi experience."}
{"text":"You know how hard it is to find good sushi in Mesa...right? I like Temari,  but sometimes want a change without having to drive to Scottsdale, or, heaven forbid, suffer the indignity of eating a \"krab\" roll at one of the many \"bigbox\" china buffets in the area.  :-)  

I just found out Sekai Sushi existed the other day...tucked away next to JoAnn Fabrics adjacent to Target.  So, I stopped in for a couple of maki rolls for lunch a few days ago.  The price was right and the taste was there too, so I went back last night to see how their sashimi and more adventurous rolls are. 

First off, if you Google Sekai Sushi you can find some reviews that bash this place on a couple of different fronts. Most point to poor (and unfriendly) service and decor.  I did not find that to be the case at all. We were greeted with a friendly hello and big smiles from the host and the sushi chef (dude? guy?).  The decor is also just fine. No it's not Stingray or Ra, but it is tastefully decorated and clean. It also isn't cramped like Sekana or Temari, which is nice.

Started off with salmon sashimi. It was excellent.  Very fresh, clean, buttery taste, and it melted in my mouth. Some of the best quality I have found in the Phoenix area.  Next stop was a Las Vegas roll, along with shrimp tempura roll.  The flavors were there, but the construction was a little lacking as they weren't as tight as they should have been.  Next time I will order more traditional rolls as I saw some go out that looked very well constructed.  I finally tried some nagiri because I felt I must....ha.   I had the hamachi (yellowtail) and I have to say, that it was the best I have ever had.  Supremely fresh, with a velvety (sp?) texture that made my eyes roll back in my head. Good stuff.   I then ended the meal with some green tea ice cream that was better than average.

Soooo....my final thoughts.  I will be going back to Sekai Sushi.  The quality of the food along with the price make this a very attractive sushi option in Mesa.  Regarding the price....the dinner I described above along with two large Asahi's....under $40.  You can't beat that with a stick."}
{"text":"We love this place.  With Kyoto closing up for good in Scottsdale, this is our new quiet hang out for quality sushi.  They will make most anything you ask for here.  Scallop Gunkan Maki isn't on the menu, but they make it for me every time.  Looking forward to taking my mother here for her birthday this Sunday."}
{"text":"Sekai Sushi keeps it simple, so I will do the same with my review:
The place is clean
Everyone was friendly
It wasn't crowded at all (Sunday evening)
The prices were average (for sushi)
But the food was fantastic.

It's a little hard to find, pushed to the back of the shopping center (which also seems to be rather nice and clean) but if you're in the neighborhood, two people can eat very well for $40 after tip.

Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Just moved to Arizona this year and this has been the best sushi place so far. Brought my little cousin for a girls date and it was amazing. Great customer service, delicious and fresh sushi. The tempura ice cream was amazing. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, my and the hubby's fav sushi place to hit up by our house! Great service, great food, friendly atmosphere. Worth a try if you are a sushi lover."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  I've been coming here for the past 5 years.  Their service can be a little slow at times, especially weekend nights.  However the rolls & sushimi are top notch."}
{"text":"I'm convinced,  best sushi for the price in the state.   I'll admit,  I'm not your \"trendy\" sushi new age eater.   It's been a staple in my life for 30+ years... so needless to say,  I challenge my friends with sushi places & I always win with this spot.  Awesome quality,  reasonable market pricing, and their authentic oyster shooters are one of the best I've had nationwide and I have had my share.  Love this \"hole in the wall\" spot."}
{"text":"My all time favorite sushi spot in AZ. Reasonably priced and super tasty! I absolutely love the salmon nigiri and matrix roll. 

03/17/2018 Update: Josh wanted to let you know that not only he has mad skills in the kitchen, but he also is beautiful to look at!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Mesa period. So apparently you can't be short and sweet on yelp. Now I have to add filler to my already add noted review."}
{"text":"Oh my!  I'm really torn when it comes to rating this place.  We went here on the recommendations we got from Mesa Yelpers who said that it was one of the best sushi joints in Mesa...

We were in town to visit with our daughter.  She had wanted to go to a sushi restaurant but didn't know where to go.  Thanks to fellow Yelpers we got some suggestions.  We chose Sekai out of all the suggestions for two reasons: 1) It gets good reviews here; and 2) For us anyway, it was very easy to find and to get to.

We went on a weekday about 5:30 p.m. and when we got there, we were the only customers.  We were warmly greeted and the service was excellent---very attentive!  The waitress brought training chopsticks to the table for the preschoolers and even suggested a dish for them for dinner.  She suggested chicken donburi and split an order between the two.  The kids liked their meal and loved using the training chopsticks.

My daughter and I ordered the deluxe sushi dinner.  My husband, who loves tuna sushi, was very disappointed to see that there was no tuna sushi/sashimi dinner.  The only way to get an all-tuna meal was to order a la carte.  In fact, we only saw 4 sushi dinners on the entire menu!

So..my husband ordered the tempura dinner and my son-in-law ordered chicken teriyaki.  The tempura was well cooked and came with a side dish that looked like cole slaw but had a sesame oil flavor to it.  The chicken teriyaki looked nothing like teriyaki.  Chicken teriyaki normally comes as a chicken breast that is grilled and cut into strips.  At Sekai, it was small chunks of chicken coated in a thin sauce.

As for the sushi --- it was okay --- not the worst I ever had but far from the best.  I rate it better than the sushi found in all you can eat buffets such as Todai and I rate it better than downscale supermarket sushi.  That said, I have had far better quality sushi elsewhere.  The deluxe sushi dinner came with 4 tuna rolls which were very wide pieces with tuna that was *meh* both in taste and quality.  Also included in the dinner---some nigiri pieces---shrimp, fake crabmeat, clam and eel.  Of all the pieces, I rate the clam to be the most interesting as I never had it before.

So...in conclusion...I was impressed with the friendly and attentive service.  In fact, I did notice that as the place got busier, many of the customers were regulars who were warmly greeted by the staff.  That, IMO, is one of the best ways to build a loyal customer base.

As for the sushi...perhaps it is as good as it gets in Mesa---that's why I was torn as to how many stars to give my review.  Would we go back?  I don't know..."}
{"text":"This is a nice hide away restaurant that fits a moderate budget. My wife and I walked in and was greeted promptly. We are seated and drinks come right out. I like the Japanese architecture of roof tops inside the establishment.  Seating is a tight fit, but there is also a patio area. Our order was taken and my wife ordered sushi rolls while I ordered from the kitchen. 
My wife's food came out quick and she loved it. My soup and salad was out early too hold me down. Seemed at least 20 min lapsed before getting my calamari appetizer and then my main dish another 10 min later. The calamari was super good. So fresh and the sauce to dip in was excellent. Main dish of spicy pork and was better than I thought also spicier than expected.
Overall service was average at best. Food was excellent and I think the restaurant could use a little face lift. We will return to try the lunch special."}
{"text":"Wonderful Sushi, good prices. Their other meals are excellent as well. Been going there since it opened in late 1997. Have celebrated numerous birthdays, anniversaries, etc. there and have the Polaroids on the wall to prove it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch. It was our first time at Sekai Sushi, and I was very impressed.
The restaurant is clean, well lit, tasteful décor, and friendly wait staff. There was only one waitress, and there was quite a crowd in there for lunch, so she was very busy, but never faulted on making sure we were taken care of.
I ordered the $5.95 lunch special which included, Chicken Teriyaki, Miso soup, a small salad, and white rice. Everything was good, except I wasn't a huge fan of the dressing they put on the salad. It was too sweet for my taste. I couldn't eat everything, as the portions are large. The miso soup was good, and the rice was good as well. The chicken teriyaki was very good, and it came with steamed veggies. Definitely going back to Sekai Sushi. Very good place!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! I love this place every time I come here. The flavors are wonderful the presentation is beautiful! Love it!"}
{"text":"Super good sushi! It's hidden in the shopping center but some of my favorite sushi. Very calming environment. The place is authentic and customer service is great.The lunch special is AMAZING and is a super good price. The Phoenix roll is great but a little spicy. The California roll is super good. The carbonation in the soda is so so good. Never flat like a lot of places."}
{"text":"Love this place this year is the 3rd year celebrating my son's birthday. Have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I love this place. My favorite thing to do is share some sushi and a bowl of their rice with chicken and curry. It tastes like comfort food and is always warm & fresh."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first Sushi experience, but it was a pretty darn good one.  My son and his family met me there and filled me in on the \"good stuff\".  Like it so much went back the next day.  The Vegas Rolls ROCKED!  The service is spot on...right there to refill my drink, take dirty dishes etc.  Friendly staff, prices are not bad at all.  I will go back again and again."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years and need to go back, but it's not exactly a convenient distance for me and I no longer have sushi buddies to dine with.  My husband doesn't like sushi.  

But, neither here nor there.  This is based off the years I did go there while I had my sushi buddies.  A friend from where we used to work at introduced me to this place.  The owner and staff always treated us super.  The food was always excellent.  I remember they would make special sushi or sashimi for us the way we wanted, with either shrimp or salmon with a very thin slice of half moon lemon and sprinkled with some dried shrimp stuff.  It was my favorite.

All the stuff we ever ate there was first class and though this was a ways from our work, it was worth the drive.  We also loved the family atmosphere.  I wish they had another place that was near us in the SE Gilbert area.  But then, I'd probably be dining alone, or I could go on a date with my 11 year old son because he does love sushi."}
{"text":"I go to Sekai Sushi all the time. It is consistently good, and the staff is great! We are always warmly greeted and have been since we first started going there. The sashimi is fantastic, and the sushi rolls are excellent! I definitely recommend trying the specials as well (my wife's favorite is the Lobster Special). All in all a great place and their pricing is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is good. Convenient location and spacious inside

Sushi is fresh and the miso is delicious."}
{"text":"Very good, fresh food. Great happy hour specials. Good service in a nice, intimate atmosphere. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in the East valley !!! Moon the owner, she's always pleasant and welcoming... Highly recommended, you want have any regret !!! 
My husband been a client for more then 10 years. I have been going there for almost 4 years now and never got disappointed... That says a lot about a place !! ;)"}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls and salads (try the squid!).  Can get price-y, and the portions are smaller than I am used to getting at other restaurants.  (I was just glad to have someone else pay for lunch!)  The chefs were quick and friendly.  It's always nice to see Asian sushi chefs working the counters."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Been a customer for about  5+ yrs.

Prices:
Everything on the menu are reasonable/affordable pricing.

Service:
Always friendly and never dissapoint. The food doesn't take long and the waiters/waitress are usually attentive to their customers. The owner is really welcoming, sweet, and you will feel like you're at home!

Food:
Good quality. Great, unique, delicious sushi rolls. Haven't found anything on the menu that I don't like yet.

Overall, I would recommend this place for everyone, great for families."}
{"text":"We were very happy with our experience at Sekai sushi. The food and service were great both times we have been. The prices and location are very reasonable as well. We will definitely go back and we will be referring others."}
{"text":"Came here due to the good reviews but I was disappointed. My first impression upon walking in was the horrid chemical smell; it smelled like a nail salon and not a restaurant. The service was not friendly, barely got a verbal acknowledgement let alone a smile from our server. The sushi did not taste very good. Our server even tried to correct a party at another table who said that their order was wrong by bringing them the original ticket which actually showed that the party was right and the server had put in order wrong. Not very professional. There was not one thing that would make me want to return."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little gem in Mesa. Everyone is friendly and attentive and the food is great. We usually go for dinner, but tried their lunch and it was good too."}
{"text":"Ordered chirashi and the fish was not fresh. Couldn't finish it because was so bad. Hard to believe that this place is known for sushi since raw fish not fresh. Also beef is shredded rather steak style. Wait for food also very long with hardly anyone in restaurant. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Yes, this is one of the better sushi places in Mesa (maybe even in the whole valley), but it's not the most amazing sushi on a global scale, or even a national scale for that matter, so take your experience with a grain of salt.

Beautifully presented and fresh tasting eel, spicy salmon was also very good. Sake and beer drink prices are pretty standard, but I like having a drink here because the restaurant itself is pretty quiet and relaxing. It's easy to have a good conversation with someone over some sushi at Sekai.

Expect a good amount of time after ordering before you receive your sushi. They usually only have 1, maybe 2 sushi chefs at any given time. My rating is on an \"AZ Sushi\" scale. Yes, I'm a snob."}
{"text":"This place is a great mom-and-pop kind of joint. The decor is Japanese kitsch, and definately fits the overall experience. *Disclaimer: this is NOT some fancy sushi restaurant. Not for sushi or food snobs. Not fine dining or high society.* --But that's why it's so good. Sekai has the most affordable sushi is the East Valley, and while they have pretty run-of-the-mill rolls, they make them consistently good. Nothing here is world class, but to be honest I go here almost more than any other sushi place (besides House Modern) because of just how cheap their sushi is. Since the rolls cost so little, this is the only sushi place where I will regularly fill up solely on sushi. As a young student, this place fits my wallet and my appetite.
Now, their other food really is quite good and also affordable, but I don't know for the price sushi just tempts me more. However, their ramen, udon, teppenyaki, katsu, curry, and tempura are all quite excellent (and yes I really have ordered and tried all of these from them before, not just B.S.). If you want some true bang for your buck, Sekai Sushi lets your dollar go further than any other Japanese restaurant that I know of in the Gilbert/Mesa/Chandler/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Seriously, if this is good sushi in Arizona, I don't want any more sushi in Arizona.  First, no fresh fish menu.  I asked about aji, shiro mutsu, etc (pretty standard fare) and the server and chefs both gave me blank stares.  Uh oh.  So I ordered uni, hamachi, smoked sake (I know.  I know.  I only ordered it because if it was all going to be bad, I might as well have something that is pretty difficult to be less than smoked salmon), and saba.  

Start with the oily fish first, so saba.  Pretty fishy, but that is to be expected.  Next, the uni.  Creamy and a little fishy rather than sweet, but I've had much worse.  Then the smoked sake.  Well, if you like lox, you'll love it.  Finally, the hamachi, which tasted like saba.  

The cooked dishes were forgettable, but not terrible.  I've never been so disappointed in a $40 check.  I could have had Outback!"}
{"text":"This wonderful gem was suggested to me by a client of mine. She told me they have a fantastic variety of dishes & sushi rolls... & boy was she right! They are often quick at bringing my order to me & very formal & polite. The atmosphere is beautiful, cultural & tranquil. Perfect for dates, birthdays & family get togethers. Thank you Sekai for always giving my fiancé & I, a quality food service!"}
{"text":"Great place to get sushi. Every roll I've ordered I've loved. The miso and eggrolls are delicious. I come back to this place fairly often and always love it."}
{"text":"Might be my new favorite sushi spot... great prices and huge portions! Super tiger roll and crunch roll were amazing! Las Vegas was way better than other versions... definitely a great spot!"}
{"text":"The quality is always excellent. The staff is friendly and accommodating. This has been my go-to for sushi for years!!!"}
{"text":"They have some amazing sushi here. The rolls are a lot bigger. Nice atmosphere and never had a complaint. I recommend trying the Phoenix Roll its like the Las Vegas roll but even better.  Definitly worth the drive and the money."}
{"text":"Sekai is one of my most favorite sushi restaurants! The staff is always friendly and greets you immediately. On top of great service, their food is incredible!!!! I highly recommend the Sekai roll and the cherry blossom roll. The sashimi is always very fresh and melts in your mouth. You must come try it for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"OH MY GAWD!

I live 3 minutes from this place, I used to go fairly often, brought friends, but it was adequate at best... My friend loved it (her first time for sushi) Then We found \"real sushi\"  and she never questioned my taste again.... I was told about Oct that it is good. So I went in, had a huge 15 dollar roll. I enjoyed it, all day today I thought wow  3 minutes from good sushi, with nothing but positive vibes even prayed when I went in. So  the older couple next to me and the 3 other people on a Saturday night at 6:30  are  all pretty tame. I like that.  two sushi chefs. and I sit at the wrong one. how do I know? keep reading. I  order sashimi yellow tail, and salmom the same thing the older couple are eating it looks huge and  lovely! I said is that  the sashimi? Yup they answer. I see the \"dude\"  cutting beautiful yellow tail in front of me, and he then hands me  this tiny little  plate of CRAP sushi so dark in color black and red, their yellow tails is 3 times the size and so is the salmon, I say Wow  I don't think I ordered right. nobody says anything, finally the  chef that cut their sushi  says oh we can cut off the dark part, and he did and handed it back to me  I walked out. I had ordered  the two sashimi plates, and the 15 dollar roll.  and more.  I don't get it??????????????????? The people even said they come once a year, and  I come all the time,  I live 3 minutes away! WHY????????????????????????There must be a reason I don't understand!"}
{"text":"For us only being one of two tables, the service was extremely slow. But it was very authentic. The food was very good and a very good amount for the price. I would go back or recommend it on that alone but it is also very kid friendly with children's specials and modified chopsticks."}
{"text":"Well after reading the reviews I decided to check out this new to me sushi joint.  I am a hard judge on sushi as I am from Seattle and have eaten a lot of fresh and amazing rolls.

With that said on to the review.  I just thought this place was eh.  I started with the usual pot-stickers which were totally pre-frozen like I can get at the store and make at home.  -1 star

Next I got my Miso soup it was typical miso so nothing to cheer or talk bad about. 

Finally my two rolls came out.  I ordered both off the special rolls list.  First was the Dec. 29th roll.  I asked about why it was called that and my waitress seemed like I was the first to ever ask that and had no answer other than that's what it's always been called. -1 star.  It was ok decent flavor and decent presentation lots of rice.  

Last roll comes out and it's my baked CH3.  I learned why the 3 was in the name there were only 3 pieces for $8.95.  I was a bit disappointed then I took a bite.  It totally made up for it the baked Halibut and crab and avocado exploded goodness in my mouth and I was happy this was my finale.  

So overall it's not bad but totally not in my top 5 best sushi places in Phoenix and surrounding areas.  If your close stop in try the CH3 roll and you will probably leave happy."}
{"text":"My first meal was delicious, crunch roll, edamame and of course a Kiri beer. We took parents however and two of the items were not so great. We ordered the tempeh shrimp which was nice and crunchy but the sauce was bland. The calamari was too chewy and we returned it. Aside from those two items however, dinner was delicious. My hubby enjoyed the spicy pork and Dad lived the teriyaki chicken. Good portions. Decent price. We ordered the crunchy rolls (a big hit), California roll (a bit weak) and tuna roll (ok but not as good as the crunch roll). 

Service was good. And prices about average. The location is strange but once you step inside it's wonderful."}
{"text":"Sooooo yeah. I love sushi. I have not found any good sushi places in the valley except Mido sushi on Kyrene and Ray (great deal if you're looking for all you can eat). My dad insisted that I HAD to try this place. So I met him and my stepmom for lunch. The lady who was our server was really nice. My stepmom got the chicken teriyaki box and some dumplings which she said were really good. Dad and I both got the 3 roll for $10 combo with California, spicy tuna, and salmon rolls. That is a lot of sushi. They were pretty good, a little spicy, but Dad absolutely loves them. I don't really judge a place off of basic rolls though, so I got some makarel, salmon, and some tuna. Wow. Nice big servings of the fish, decent serving of rice, and the quality was the best that I have ever had in the valley. For quality, this place gets the cake, but for value I think I will still go to Mido because I eat a lot of nigiri or fancy rolls. But seriously, this place is good, give it a try. The miso soup was good too :)"}
{"text":"Popped in to Sekai on the 4th of July.  Found the place quiet and nearly empty.  White table cloths and friendly faces.  Fish was fresh.  I always order sashimi.  You can't hide old fish.  It was superb.  The Hamachi Kama was a bit over priced but really delish.  My partner ordered the soft shell crab roll which looked delightful.  A sweet little gem after finding my usual spot becoming inconsistent with their quality."}
{"text":"Have only been here once. The experience was pretty decent. I got the beef teriyaki. The beef was very fatty not much flavor and tough. On top of that it $6 more than the chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"Same meal, same deal. I was just as impressed with the sushi here as I was the first time. I took my daughter here and she was impressed. She's from a coastal city and  is not easily impressed with sushi here in the valley."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat. The food is fresh and always made perfect..Our family likes to sit at the bar and talk with the staff as our food is made.The place is always clean and inviting.I would recommend this place to everyone..We drive far and always love it."}
{"text":"This is a good sushi restaurant in Mesa.  Tonight (02/14/2014) they appeared to be rather busy.  This is most likely because of Friday & Valentine's Day.  

We ordered the mix tempura and the sushi boat. 

My wife is particularly picky about sushi.  She was impressed.  

1) The portion sizes were huge for a sushi restaurant.

2) They were NOT skimpy with the fish.  They was a lot more fish with this sushi compared to the other places in the Phoenix AZ (which tend to load the sushi with rice to make up for the small amount of fish they serve)

3) The sushi was really fresh.  

4) The crabmeat sushi tasted like real crabmeat and not surimi or flour (imitation crabmeat)

About the only thing we could have done differently is order less food.  It was a lot, and we ended up taking part of it home.  

We would most likely go back here.  I will definitely take my in-laws (from Vietnam) here, and my own parents.  My parents are particular about their sushi.  

This place looks like it has a good clientele.  I hope that they keep busy, and are able to stay in business for years to come."}
{"text":"This is good sushi that is fairly reasonable.  The service is always excellent.  They have a great variety of rolls and even have a \"rainbow roll\" for those unsure of what kind of fish you want to try."}
{"text":"When I first moved back to the East Valley after a long stint in California the first thing I asked was, WHERE IS THE SUSHI? I needed a fix and fast. I figured my sushi eating days were over when I left the Golden State. 

On a recommendation from a friend of a friend who's lived in the area for a long time, we ended up at Sekai Sushi. I had my doubts. I thought there was no way an excellent sushi bar could be in a strip mall in the heart of Mesa but I was seriously impressed from the minute I walked in. The chefs are always super nice, the servers are attentive, and the fish and rolls are fantastic. Everything is very fresh."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi spot.  Fabulous Las Vegas rolls (my favorite!) and chicken teriyaki danburi. I also love how they bring out rice mixed with miso soup and modified chopsticks for my kids."}
{"text":"Large building, quiet, clean. Roll was okay. I don't remember what I ordered though. The gyoza are tiny and very soggy. Miso was very good. The waitress never checked on me but was very chatty with an older lady that seemed like a regular. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was 11, the food is always delicious and I have no complaints about that. The service is becoming increasingly worse and worse. It took the staff 30 minutes to bring me my check, which made me late back to work. Another couple also brought up they were on a lunch break, but it didn't seem to phase the waitress. They also raised the prices on everything, and lessened their portions. On the menu it says soup and salad served with meals. Well I got the soup, it was half a bowl, but didn't get the salad. My chicken yakisoba came out with 3 wimpy pieces of chicken, and one piece of broccoli... seriously? Ps nothing on your lunch menu is $5.95 so you should probably remove that sign outside your restaurant. Be more transparent with your advertising."}
{"text":"The best sushi in the valley for the best price! Atmosphere is cozy, always clean, and the fish is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi spot! The inside is nicely decorated with a pleasant atmosphere. We got the Sekai roll and tempura appetizer which was so delicious!! They also bring you a hot towel to cleanse your hands as well as a bowl of warm miso soup. We were in and out in good time after a whole day of moving and this was the perfect way to end the day! Highly recommend trying it at least once."}
