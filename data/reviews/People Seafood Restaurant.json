{"text":"My family had dinner with our uncle, aunt and cousins at People Seafood Restaurant during this Chinese New Year's weekend.  It was jam-packed (as most Chinese restaurants are during this time), but luckily we had reserved a table.  The one thing that I will give kudos to People Seafood Restaurant for is that they do not force you to choose of set dinner menus.  Almost every other Chinese restaurant will during the holidays, and the food is usually subpar.   We ordered the following dishes: Peking Duck  Lettuce Duck Wraps Garlic Mushroom Beef Fried Oyster Shrimp/BBQ Pork Fried Rice Deep Fried Shrimp with Broccoli Clams Braised in Black Bean Sauce  We got a complimentary Lotus Root Pork Bone Soup and Red Bean Sweet Soup as dessert.  The peking duck was a little bit oily for my taste buds, and the skin was not as crisp as I have had at other restaurants.  The crepe was an absolute disappointment - dry, and very thick.  A good crepe should be thin and somewhere between moist and crispy.  The duck itself was not too fatty, which was good.  Nothing worse than ordering a Peking Duck and all you can taste is the fat and not much meat.  The crepe was probably store-bought, and hence was not very good.  The Lettuce Duck Wraps were quite flavourful, although I found the duck meat itself to be a bit on the dry side.  The lettuce was crisp and fresh.  The Garlic Mushroom Beef was a bit \"chewy\" but the mushrooms were very moist and tender, and I loved the garlic-infused goodness of the dish (just remember to bring a stick of gum in tow).  The oysters were very creamy and smooth.  It was braised with scallions and some sort of hoisin-soy sauce sauce.  Nothing too extraordinary.  The Shrimp/BBQ Pork Fried Rice was nice and eggy, not too oily.  It did not feel greasy and oily.  The Deep Fried Shrimp with Broccoli was very tasty. They dusted the shrimp with powdered salted egg yolk which gave it a very velvety, yet, powdery flavour.  It was very rich, and I had never tried it before.  The broccoli was cooked in chicken broth, which gave it a slight infusion of salty goodness.  The broccoli was also very crisp and crunchy.    Lastly, we had the Clams Braised in Black Bean Sauce. As with most of the dishes of the evening, the chef was a little heavy on the sodium.  Every dish we had, starting from the soup, was heavily salted which kind of ruined otherwise savoury dishes.  Some of the clams didn't open up.    The Red Bean Sweet Soup was really good. Not too sweet.  I would've preferred a thicker consistency though as I found it was a bit \"thin\".    All in all, we paid $115 for our meal, and it fed 8 people.  I think the reason why the food wasn't as carefully prepared was because it was a busy weekend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have gone here many a Saturday or Sunday morning/afternoon, nursing a hangover and chowing down on dim sum as my friends and I recall the previous night's happenings.   I find the servers incredibly friendly, the food comes fast - but you might have to wait a while to be seated. The food is great and this is the restaurant that got me started on my love for dim sum."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is directly across from Markville Mall. A popular place for dim sum for the people that lives in the area.  Dim sum are cheap here ($2.00 weekday all day for all sizes and $2.20 weekend all day )! You ordered directly from checking off the ones that you want from the order sheets.. no waiting for someone to push them around.. They do have special items that the waiter carried around in a tray.  Dim Sum is served till 4 pm! so if you want to avoid the crowd come late!!  For dinner, they have entrees starting from $5.99. All comes with their special soup - papaya with fish .  I found their stir-fried dishes a little oily....ok a lot oily!! So make sure you ask them to take it easy on the oil when you order.  Services can be slow because they often short of wait staffs during busy hours  CASH only!"}
{"text":"A very standard Chinese restaurant. I went there for lunch and it was really crowded. The food is a fairly standard affair, nothing stands out. What is really annoying though is the waiters carrying the specials walk around and yell really loud. Having a conversation at lunch is pretty much impossible."}
