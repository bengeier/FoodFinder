{"text":"Came here for lunch on a whim, was expecting decent Chinese food, but got terrible portions and food thats lower grade than what you can get at some run down mall. Ordered the steamed chicken with rice, waited about 15-20 mins for it and the amount of chicken they give you is pretty much nothing. Theres about 5-6 pieces of steamed chicken thats about the size of your pinky, with the rest being broccolis and rice. The broccoli to chicken ratio was literally 3 to 1. The portion wasn't very generous, before I realized it, I had finished the chicken and left with rice and broccoli. It would have been 2 stars if the chicken was good but it had no taste, very bland and dry. Honestly disappointed, and the whole thing costs a bit over $7, definitely not worth."}
{"text":"Ordered two dishes, one beef, one chicken. Very little meat, almost all mixed poorly cut vegetables. Also not really tasted like Thai food?Won't order there anymore although the location is convenient."}
{"text":"My first time here and I ordered the yellow curry lunch special with steamed rice.  I asked that it not be too spicy and it was the perfect spice level for me.  I was also pleased with the variety of vegetables it came with: baby corn, bell peppers, celery, onions and carrots (rather than just onions).  The chicken was cut into small slices but there was enough of them.  Steamed rice was done perfectly."}
{"text":"So here I am waiting for my food and the guy cooking my food decides to clean his nose while cooking... decided not eat here and left.
Last time I came here they dropped a fork on the floor, picked it up and continue cooking with it. 
I figure I'll give them the 5 second rule and one more chance. But today did it. No more General Thai. I wonder what goes a the back 
Don't eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few things off the menu. 1st the red curry: it didn't come with rice where every other Thai place does... it had alot of veggies but the curry itself was literally like water! 
2nd: The beef ginger was stale! 
3rd the Shanghai chicken noodle was ok! But kind of bland...
4th Cantonese chow mein: this dish had no taste, lacked flavor 
5th: chicken fried rice: the best out of all five dishes, it's fried rice, thankfully they didn't mess that up either.  

Overall I wouldn't go back... You can get much better food at Thai room Vaughan or even hakka legend in Markham"}
{"text":"I work across the street and we usually order regularly from this place. The customer service has decreased lately each time we order for delivery ever since we stopped tipping the delivery guy. The reason for not tipping? Because he is very rude. Today (which will probably be the last time we're ordering from them) we specifically asked for 3 separate bills, but when he came to drop off the food, everything was on one bill and we wanted to pay separately. As I was getting my wallet to grab my credit card to pay, he grabbed my coworker's $20 bill out of her hand and just walked out...really?! That's how customers are treated here?! Ontop of that, the guy over the phone said our order will take 45 minutes...we didn't get our food until an hour and a half later. When we called back to ask where our food was, the guy over the phone said \"I don't know what happened I'm sorry\"...WE ARE LITERALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LIGHT IN THE LOBLAWS PLAZA!! How can someone get lost or get stuck in traffic when we're literally across the street?! He could've walked faster than driving....Lastly, I like my egg rolls with the plum sauce. When our food arrived, all the plum sauce packets were opened/pierced open. How can that be possible when the packets are sealed closed and the packaging is pretty strong unless if someone rips it themselves? I have never experienced this at any restaurant before and it's a shame because their food is pretty good along with the price. I DO NOT recommend this place! Might as well go elsewhere where you are treated properly by staff, rather than getting a bill grabbed out of your hand when you weren't ready to pay."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time! 
Good quality food for a great price!
My new Chinese food take out spot."}
{"text":"This restaurant is clean, staff is somewhat efficient, food is good and cheap!! I would go again"}
{"text":"Ordered here the first time tonight. Kung pao chicken combo for one which came with fried rice and a spring roll. Very mediocre in taste, definitely not Thai. Good portion size and the spring roll was tasty. If you're looking for something mildy satisfying, this is the place to go. It wasn't for me though and I wouldn't visit again. Staff were very friendly. This is a take out only place."}
{"text":"Nothing Thai or Chinese about this place. Just quick fried carbs with very little vegetables or meat. So expect empty fried carbs that lack  flavor other than salt and oil...you will get alot of salt and oil."}
{"text":"The place is Chinese owned so I was surprised that their pad Thai was so delicious! Their dumplings were great too. They have lunch specials until 4pm. Good portions as well."}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout from this place twice, pretty decent. General Thai is a small takeout place that seemingly has been around for years... just a neighbourhood takeout place for Asian food.

I've gotten the pad thai both times and it does not disappoint, it is not too greasy and includes tons of chicken pieces and tofu; price is reasonable as well (just over $10 after tax).

Got my food within minutes, can't complain, good place to pick up dinner and go home... there's not much other Asian food in the area."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and delicious.   What more could you ask for, especially given the poor selection of restaurants in this area.  

I've loved everything I had here, except the pad Thai. 

We are now regulars and will be coming back often."}
{"text":"I had the Tom Yum soup and guess what? I had food poisoning!

Not only do those guys not wear gloves, they touch money and then make your food!

With my Tom Yum Soup, the soup tasted like it was made from sewage water and seasoned with disgusting tom yum paste. The shrimp they added, was frozen and not even CLEANED PROPERLY BECAUSE THERE WAS STILL POOP. 

So if you want to tear your arse a new one, you can go to general thai for only $11.50!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff 
Clean and affordable place , they even deliver and the service is fast as well .
They have a pretty big menus and lots of options to choose from .
Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"I live in the area. After passing this place countless number of times I decided to actually try it for the first time about a month ago and was very pleasantly surprised. We tried one of the dinners for 3 as well as a side shrimp dish and all the food was very tasty. My only criticism was that when I went on the website to try to place my order ahead for pickup the site would not allow me to finalize the order. So I had to end up calling it in. I would definitely take out from here again."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese and Thai food. I am used to going to food courts like fmp, and the food from them is just as good.  They are way better than a Manchu wok or something you get in a mall.  Their general tso chicken is very good and their friend rice is fresh...you can actually see the fresh egg bits.  Will definitely go back...good portion size too."}
{"text":"Really great food, really good price. I like all their dishes. My favorite is the Shanghai Noodles with beef, and General Tsao chicken. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Any time we're in the mood for fast, reasonably priced Chinese food, we order from General Thai. I'm always happy to support family run businesses that provide great service and value for money. I highly recommend the chilli chicken! It's consistently delicious! The shrimp wonton soup is always really good too. Give them a try!"}
