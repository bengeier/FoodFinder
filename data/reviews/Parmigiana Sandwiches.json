{"text":"Wow,  happened upon this place by accident in an industrial area.  Place was packed so I tried it.  What a gem.  Veal sandwich is awesome,  had a side of rapini,  perfectly cooked. Little pricy, but we'll worth it.  Blond lady behind the counter had eyes that would melt an iceberg,  I'm going back"}
{"text":"Sandwich as alright. I have had better before.. Price was also OK. If u want to go there make sure u have cash with u as they don't have any machine or apple pay. Welcome to old school ways."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, I found this place from Yelp and it lives up to its reviews. If you love a nice size veal sandwich this is the best I ever had, worth the money! Very nice service but kinda crowded, not much close parking because it's in an industrial unit, still worth it !!"}
{"text":"Best veal I've ever had.I work nearby and this is my go-to lunch place. Always get the veal plate as the portion is good enough...can't really finish a sandwich plus I LOVE their sauce. Extra sauce is a must for veal plate! The owner is very friendly. During lunch time it's quite crowded so I normally go before 11:30. Wish they can extend their hours so I can pick up dinner as well!"}
{"text":"I have always loved having lunch here when I used to work in the area. One of the most exquisite experiences I have had with food and specially Italian sandwiches. The shop is family owned and operated (I think, don't quote me) and they make the best Veal and chicken sandwiches (in the same scale as California Sandwiches). The service is also very good. I have been here very often and the service and quality has never been low or even semi-bad. Btw bring cash.

The only down sides are: they are only open for lunch until 4:00 pm , closed on weekends, and very hard to find if it's your first time there ( it's located in a sub alley behind the plaza at the corner of Weston Rd.)"}
{"text":"One of the best panini places around. Authentic Italian style in every way. Chicken or Veal, one bite and you'll be in heaven. Soooo good just like Nonna's home cooking. I've had many panini's but this place will leave you craving more. #proper"}
{"text":"Fantastic local sandwich shop. Bread is fresh and sandwiches are made to order and delicious. Cozy little interior and you can tell there is a local clientele that visit often which means it's great food."}
{"text":"Time and time again, the best sauce, the best veal, the best chicken, the best meatball sandwiches in Ontario and beyond! I have yet to find a better place! Thank you for providing this amazing food!"}
{"text":"nothing special. decent service and speed but fairly forgettable experience."}
{"text":"Let's talk Veals.... I have been eating these Bad Boys for years... back to the days of Commisso bakery on Eddystone at 4 in the morning.  This veal is a knockout!!  Family run business. Service with a smile and expedited. Reasonably priced. I have also ordered their lasagna for parties...delicious. If you are in Vaughan, this is the place to stop for a great veal."}
{"text":"The sandwich I had was decent but I expected better given the great reviews on here. Friendly staff and got my food quick despite the fact that it was busy. The chicken cutlet was a lot smaller than I have had at other places and it could have used more sauce. Hot peppers (which are free at most places) were not offered. They offered spicy spread but it wasn't that spicy. Probably wouldn't return to this place as there are better places for Italian sandwiches. 

Price for a sandwich with no toppings and a can of Diet Coke was $10.15 with tax. I think you could do better for that kind of money."}
{"text":"The sauce that they use for these sandwiches are better than most, however I would recommend their chicken over their veal. And I usually would always pick veal. I don't think their veal is as good as others, but their chicken with their sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"Had bad experiences in this plaza's parking lot on a weekday during lunch hour, but the sandwiches are decent.  Good size and amount of fillings for the price.  Comparable to other places nearby for Italian sandwiches.  Great friendly service."}
{"text":"A small sandwich shop somewhat off the beaten path with excellent food. Fresh crusty Italian bread and delicious veal. Not a huge menu but what they make is excellent."}
{"text":"Best Veal Parm sandwich in the city!

Found this place today while getting my car serviced down the street and glad that I did! Off the beaten path with a regular clientele. Fast and friendly ordering and the veal did not disappoint! Meat was crispy and flavourful and made fresh and the bread stayed crusty even with the sauce which was amazing with just the right spice! Found my new go to veal parm spot!"}
{"text":"This would be a 5-star review if this establishment accepted debit cards and credit cards unfortunately it's a cash-only business that has a bank machine inside the charges you $2.50 to withdraw money other than that the sandwiches are phenomenal and they are always great I have been coming here since they open the doors and have never had a bad meal here highly recommend eating here"}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM ALERT!!!!!

In the middle of an industrial area hidden in an industrial unit lies Parmigiana Sandwiches.  Anyone in the Vaughan area knows that sandwich places are a dime a dozen so it takes a lot to stand out from the others.  Parmigiana does just that.  In the middle of an industrial plaza this place is a guaranteed hidden gem.  Upon entering you know right away that you are about to have authentic Italian food.  Its a family run business right down to the the cute Italian grandmother cooking in the kitchen.  They are only open Monday to Friday until 3 pm or 4 pm so you can only enjoy a sandwich for a few short hours daily.  My suggestion is to get out there and try this place as you will not be disappointed.  Do you self a favor although the service is quick if you are there after 12 noon you are guaranteed a line up.  I usually like to get there just before 12 to beat the rush.  Last time I tried the veal cutlet deluxe sandwich.  Its the veal but instead of sauce it had lettuce, tomato and mayo on it.  The veal was fried perfectly, the bun was super fresh and just the right amount of toppings.  Parmigiana Sandwiches just happens to be close by to my work so there will be many more visits in the near future."}
{"text":"The best place to get a sandwich if you need a chicken parm fix. 

I always get the veal and the portion is very generous. Sides are extra but that's common. 

If you come on lunch expect a wait. 

They only take cash****"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! Have been here a few times and have tried three of their sandwiches, including the veal, steak, and meatball. All of which have been exceptionally delicious. Combine that with the friendly staff, great service, and huge servings, I think that this will be go to place for a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwiches (or plate) out there...trust me.   And both Mom and daughter (assuming) are pretty cute.  Lol"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best veal sandwiches I have had. Love the option for a spicy sauce. Meat was tender and the breeding just right. 
Friendly staff and quick service despite the place being very busy."}
{"text":"BEST BEST BEST veal sandwiches I've ever eaten! Veal deluxe is my favourite. Family owned place. Great customer service. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Hidden gem indeed! If you have the chance I would definitely check this place out. It's a family run joint that has amazing Italian sandwiches. 

I found this place as I was in area. Picked up to-go sandwiches before boarding. I ordered the veal cutlet Sandwich with mushrooms and cheese. Amazing. You can adjust your spicy level. It's quite spicy if you want spicy! So I recommend medium-hot. 

Pretty good. I would definitely come back. I believe it's decently priced. You could get a decent sandwich for about $10. Add additional toppings for a certain price each ($1.50-3 I believe). Create the sandwich the way you want it! 

PS. They only take cash. They have an atm inside for you to use with a $2.50 service fee."}
