{"text":"This is a simple, mid-ranged Italian place with everything you would ever want from one. You will pay decent prices but the food in general is worth more than they charge; it is the norm to pay less than ten dollars for a large plate of pasta. Service is typically good and you will never wait too long for your orders. Definitely worth a go."}
{"text":"By far my favourite restaurant!  The staff is very pleasant (Louis especially) The food is always so full of flavour and the portions are always large! The Antipasti for two with calamari, bruschetta and sausage is dynamite and every table d'h√¥te item I have tried I have loved!   Loyal customer for the past 11 years!  We came across this gem after a cold night of sledding up north, all other restaurants had closed but they welcomed us quickly with hot chocolate and delicious meals!   Thank you!  (Can be loud at times as they being in numerous groups however it's definitely worth it)"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant, just got renovated. It's a casual place for a nice plate of pasta, don't expect the deluxe Italian meal nor a mom and pop type cuisine.  Its a simple Italian place without all the works. The food is good, not expensive."}
