{"text":"I'm a tad bit torn about posting a \"positive\" review about Cafe Moi... for purely selfish reasons. I love the place. I love that I can walk out of the subway station, into Cafe Moi, and quickly get a good quality coffee on my way to work. But, when I started telling my friends/co-workers about this little place, it started to get REALLY busy... and now I have to wait in line to get a coffee (and the line-ups seem to be getting longer and longer).   I guess that's a good thing for the baristas... they are doing everything right! The Aussies who work here are incredibly friendly and awesome!   Cafe Moi shares space with the Sandwich Box (another great place). It's in a part of town where there are not a lot of GOOD takeaway coffee options... but plenty of crappy, overheated, over sweetened Starbucks-like options. The Cafe Moi baristas know how to pull good espresso, how to heat milk properly, and one of the baristas even introduced me to the world of mixing almond/soy milk (it increases the creaminess but prevents curdling).  They also get bonus points for having gluten free and vegan food options always available. It's definitely my morning go to for breakfast/coffee."}
{"text":"I came here today in celebration of their two year anniversary. I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was very happy and laidback, but also professional.  I wanted a vanilla latte, but they were out of vanilla. Understandable, because I came just before they closed. I settled on a mocha instead. The coffee looked pretty, and tasted great.  I also tried a chocolate chip cookie and it was amazing!  My only concern is the seating. There is one large table and a bar against the window. This is shared by the coffee shop and the sandwich shop in the same place. If it is busy, there will probably be nowhere to sit.  All in all, I was very satisfied. This is one of the best coffee shops I have tried in this part of the city. It is near Bloor-Yonge Station and the Toronto Reference Library, which is very convenient.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This snowstorm today completely paralyzed the downtown traffic. However it lead me to cafe moi while waiting for my shuttle bus.   This coffee shop is tucked inside a corner of sandwich box. They offer small variety of coffee on the menu with tea and pastries on the side. There are some soup containers by the wall, so they probably serve soup later in the day. The coffee and pastries here are priced resonantly. With one barista only, but he works fast.You can also find some coffee beans by the cash register.  The barista is also the person who roasted the beans here here. Apparently the beans are organic, priced from$13-$17/bag.   I ordered a flat white. It was made with the Hale Espresso beans. Without any sugar, the flat white has this light almost not there caramel sweetness in it, very smooth. It doesn't have the sourness I don't like, enjoyed it a lot, wish I got a large cup. Will definitely go back to buy a bag of it and try out other drinks offered here."}
{"text":"This place is inside sandwich box. It's a great addition to this lunchtime essential. The coffee is good and the sandwich selection is cheaper than the Box."}
{"text":"Luke warm latte and breakfast sandwich with egg that looks -- and tastes-- like a spongy brick. Service was fine. Seating is benches with no usable back or stools at counter."}
{"text":"This is a really nice little coffee shop tucked inside the sandwich box. The service was very calm and friendly. Very chill atmosphere, even when we came minutes before they closed the guy didn't rush us at all! The Americano was very delicious and flavourful.. Only 2.70 which is a standard Americano price. Great location since you can literally walk steps and grab a sandwich to pair with your coffee at other side of store at sandwich box. Definitely will come here again. Extra points for offering smooth pay for payment."}
{"text":"Bad coffee and expensive. The place was cold and uncomfortable. The washrooms were dirty, no toilet paper, no hand soap, and no options to dry your hands (electrical dryer nor paper). You can see the entrance to the kitchen when you go to the washroom, and the entrance was as dirty as the washroom. The guy who prepared my coffee was nice, though."}
{"text":"Comfortable coffee shop on Bay north of Bloor. Lots of seating and good for people watching if you sit along the window. Good coffee and you can get a sandwich too. There aren't many coffee shops in the area other than Sbux which is always full.so nice to see a much needed coffee shop in the area."}
{"text":"Had an almond milk latte that was pretty weak to be completely honest. Pretty aesthetically for a cafe but not many drink options."}
{"text":"Stepped in for a snack and coffee. Service was pleasant and efficient, food was pretty tasty (pastry and a custom made sandwich). There are tables with group/family style seating; multiple guests sharing a table. It was a very positive experience."}
