{"text":"I was skeptical about this place but I was hungry and decided to give it a try. The storefront it's self is very unassuming and kind of forgettable, but the food their dishing up is anything but! I got the tempura fried shrimp, Cylon fried chicken, fish molee, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, and some butter naan.  Everything was absolutely delicious and not overly spiced. The dishes accurately and captivatingly captured the essence of fine Indian cooking while keeping up with modern sensibilities. The Cylon fried chicken was absolutely to die for, the chicken was very tender, juicy, and seasoned to perfection. I have vivid dreams about this chicken from time to time. It's  that good.   I don't normally like biryani but I decided to give it a try on a whim. The rice was very soft and there was ample tender chicken. I especially love the touch of saffron essence which permeated from the hot dish. I consider myself a connoisseur of tempura shrimp and man let me tell you, what their doing here with tempura batter and shrimps should be classified as a schedule 1 drug. It was addictingly good.  As you can tell, I really enjoyed the food and fare found at Ocean Palate. I have been back numerous times and have always been beyond pleased and satisfied. The only reason I gave it a 5 star rating is because I couldn't give it 6! Do yourself a favor and get you some of this delicious food!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Mutton Chettinad, Goan Shrimp Curry and Kerela Fish Fry. The fish tasted really fresh and the spices were great but the mutton had undercooked potatoes and barely had any flavour and the shrimp was the frozen kind and extremely oily.   I wanted to like this place but I was very disappointed so won't be back again."}
{"text":"Firstly,the chef is a really friendly person. Secondly,we ordered chicken kadhai and malabar chicken curry-it was insanely awesome! Thirdly,best naans ever... Must try for Indian food."}
{"text":"Improved significantly since opening. Great Indian food at a great price. The owner is extremely friendly. Only downside is the location. This restaurant is great but most people will never know of it since it's tucked into the World on Yonge Condominiums, but my partner and I love this place for fast Indian food so much we like to advertise it to friends and family. Their mixed-vegetable curry is delicious and our favourite thing to buy. Samosas and vegetable cutlet are also great options to try and come with delicious sauces on the side."}
{"text":"I was hopeful about this meal since I was craving good indian food. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the majority of items we ordered :(  The good: - The butter paneer was pretty tasty. Best part about this meal. - The south indian vegetable cutlet was pretty good flavor-wise. Nice 'n crispy outside, a little mushy inside. Good vinegar-y dip. - The strawberry lassi was okay in general, but it wouldn't surprise me if they just put a few strawberry gogurts in a to-go cup.  The bad: - Mixed vegetable sambar had a REALLY unpleasant flavor/scent. Maybe just not my preference? I couldn't finish my serving. - Pilau rice tasted like plain white rice with very little evidence of any seasoning. - Ocean palate kurkura naan was dry, and the only appealing aspect was the cranberries. - Tandoori roti was also VERY dry and overcooked.  Given our takeout experience here I was surprised to see so many positive reviews. Overall, this meal made me sad."}
{"text":"The Konkan Shrimp here is awesome - the masala that they add here is simply too good. I also like the Kadhai Chicken. We always go with the home delivery and are pleased with the response time. Overall, a good place to try out for home delivery if you are craving for some good Indian food."}
{"text":"We ordered on justeat.com. The food was fast, the delivery guy was really friendly, and most importantly the food was great. Hot, fresh and really tasty. Will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the butter chicken express for $5.99 and it had fresh ingredients and great taste all around. Pricing is competitive for Indian food I have had before in neighbouring areas and for a quick stop in this plaza at World on Yonge, (second level food court) its filling and delicious. Would recommend for anyone willing to try."}
