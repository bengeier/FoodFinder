{"text":"The service was great, nice atmosphere.  The food can be summed up in one word: DELICIOUS!  The fried plantains, the fried dumplings,  ting and brown stew chicken all were on point. They also deliver for free.....what?! I have found my new place to eat.  Just to give you an idea of how happy am I with the food and service at this restaurant,  I am still here sitting in the booth writing this review."}
{"text":"Finally I found a Carib√©ana restaurant in my backyard, and I really enjoy the food. So far I've had the curried chicken dinner,which is my favorite so far. The brown stew chicken is good too.  Next will be the oxtails, and curried goat.  The food is seasoned perfectly to taste and nice portions too. The owner of the restaurant is such a pleasant lady, and I hope the review will result in others visiting the restaurant."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and waitress are pretty cool.  They don't have half the menu items.  `The food took FOREVER!  May give it another try."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  I enjoyed the curry chicken with the rice, beans, and cabbage.  I also enjoyed trying fried dumplings, fried plantains, and the wonderful drink called ting!  This place is a must-go!!!"}
{"text":"This is not the worse Caribbean place I've been too but definitely not the best. Located on a small business plaza with only 6 spots this place was tucked away in the back. We weren't sure if we had arrived because here was no visible sign with the business name on it. We eventually found it at the very end of the lot with colored posters in the window reading Caribeana. Most of the business did the same so I walked on in.  The place was empty as it was 8 pm and they closed at 9. The location doesn't help either but we say down to order. I ordered an appetizer of fries dumplings and fries plantains...the plantains were amazing tasting like sweet buttery goodness with a slight crispness. The dumplings were not what I was expecting. It was only fried bread with nothing special on the inside but more bread. I guess I assumed Chinese dumplings would be something similar to theirs but I guess not.   We ordered the jerk chicken and brown stew chicken that comes with cabbage as well as rice and beans. Our appeitzers took about 40 minutes to get to our table and the main entree didn't come until 20 minutes after that. I almost considered leaving but I really wanted to see if the food would be with the wait. Unfortunately it wasn't. Rice and beans were nothing special lacking flavor along with the cabbage. I wanted more of the sides before I ordered but they did not have enough.  Maybe it was because it was late and we were there last customers but I think if people show up an hour before closing than service shouldn't take an hour. My main course is not worth taking about. Although the BBQ sauce for the jerk chicken was good the brown stew didn't taste like it had enough spices.   I'm willing to try this spot again only because I'm a huge fan of Caribbean food and it's super close to my house. Hopefully it won't disappoint as much next time."}
{"text":"I have ordered take-out, haven't  tried dinning in, so I'm unable to rate that portion. Tips for takeout, call ahead of time, this will save you the wait, as well as give you the opportunity to assess whether or not what you're craving is available, i.e. goat is not always on the menu for thee day (the reason for the 4 vs 5 stars). The brown stewed chicken is fall off the bone, and has always been seasoned to perfection. I prefer it over the curry chicken."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh, this restaurant is worth the drive! Great portions for the price (I'm enjoying my leftovers from yesterday as I type this) and everything is super fresh (tip: call ahead if you want the shrimp).  Best Caribbean food in the 'Burgh area!"}
