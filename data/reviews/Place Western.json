{"text":"Excellent food and service. If you're close to Mont-Royal, stop by this place and get the smoked meat sandwich with their homemade frites. I normally go to Schwartz for their sandwiches but Place Western has a great selection. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place should be listed in the Secret Gem category. Amazing food and very friendly customer service!!! We came in to pick up a takeout. While waiting we were offered by the owner to try his latest recipe of smoke meat and apple juice marinated fries; it was truly out of this world. At the end we end up leaving with 3 meals instead of 2. We feel lucky we decided to stop by.

The next day we visited Schwartz's smoke meat. Schwartz had an okay customer service and the smoke meat sandwich was alright but we were actually disappointed since Place Western had already raised the bar so high and we had read so many good reviews of Schwartz. 
Both smoke meats were very tender and did not need a knife. The main difference was the flavors. I know they both marinated their meat for hours but Schwartz's one was not flavorful for our taste buds; we could not detect any spices or aromas.

We did not go to Schwartz for the fries but I have to mention that the fries at Schwartz were pretty basic; I had better fries at MacDonald or Smashburger.

If you are just visiting Montreal I will advice to try both so you can make your opinion. But there is only one place I will return; PLACE WESTERN."}
{"text":"Very good place. Don't let the little number of review drive you away. The smoke meat is so good. Way better than the famous place. Even the fries are so good."}
{"text":"This place is official the food is amazing.  The smoked meat is to die for.  It's seasoned in rub and sits for 30 days.  Ribs melt off the bone and the lamb shank was the same.   My sons burger was amazing.  And there fries are even aged a special way to make them stand apart.  And there special sauces.  Unique beers and wine was excellent too, Ghino the chef/owner was so down to earth and cool as was the rest of the staff.  Every time we come back we will be stopping here for sure."}
{"text":"OMG!!! the fries and smoked meat are to die for. Perfectly seasoned and taste amazing. Also try the house-made ginger ale. Definitely a place to go in Montreal. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat, best burger and best fries in Montreal, so it's worth paying a little more than elsewhere. They put a lot of care into the food, and the results are tasty!"}
