{"text":"Definitely one of the best fish sandwiches in the North Hills. Yes the place is a dive bar, however the food has never been a disappointment. Everything is priced separately, so a bargain this place is not. Try lunch instead of dinner as it seems less busy and not as many loud folk around at happy hour time. Waitstaff could have more personality, but it is what it is ..the tip isn't included either."}
{"text":"The pic is wrong. What was served was more like a fish cake. A prepared one like fish sticks molded together . A large fish stick. It was not meaty.
So it'll be a long time coming before going back to willee's."}
{"text":"My favorite bartender at Willees' on Fridays would have to be bruce. Although I can't have fish (which I'm told are the best) there bacon burger and cheese sticks are great.    

The Jukebox is located by the door, but since they have there TouchTunes disabled remotely everything is done by hand. Everyone seems friendly inside for the most part, and they have a separate room for smoking inside. 

They do serve Guinness however it's not on tap sadly, but don't let that get you down because they still have yuengling."}
{"text":"This place looks a little scary from the outside, but inside was clean, the staff was super friendly and the beer was cold.  It's a very nice, low key place to grab a drink with a friend. Chicken wings were amazing!"}
{"text":"Known forever as THE best fish sandwich in the north hills and maybe even Pittsburgh, Willee's has pretty much earned its reputation. We've been going here for over 25 years - always for fish and always smiling when we get it. Everyone has a place they can tell you about when you ask them where's the best fish sandwich. It's like asking \"where's the  best pizza?\", right? Opinions are as varied as the options. How can you argue? You can't. But once you taste Willee's fish, you'll have to agree that it's up there with whatever other place you might have thought was the best initially. This is clearly in the running. Is it perfect? No. Is it good? Absolutely. Get the large order.

I prefer to eat in the bar area even though they have a \"dining\" area off to the side. You'll see families in there a lot - they all come for the fish. From the outside you'd probably consider not setting foot inside. Yeah, it looks like the dive bar it is. And once in the bar area, you'll be convinced that it's nothing more than a dive bar.  Sure, it's a little rough around the edges. But ignore that. Get the fish. 

My only complaint is that they have 3 taps for draft beer - one for Bud, one for Miller Lite, and one for Yuengling. Not much of a choice. But I can toss back a Yuengling pretty easily!"}
{"text":"Good food! Salad needs work. It's all greens, plus a little tomato and a piece of cucumber. 
BUT you really increased wine prices"}
{"text":"Dive bar of dive bars!!! 

Go for the fish sandwich and a beer (or fish on a dish if you're watching your carbs). Seriously, the menu is huge, but the fish is what you eat at this place. Absolutely amazing. 

Service is what you'd expect- rough and tough. Regulars abound (some have been there for decades)."}
{"text":"I have been living out here for almost 19 years nick name city girl. My first experience with this establishment was poor. Fish is fair bar is gross and the bathrooms dirty. Everything on the menu was extra including the cheese on the fish sandwich. Check added up quick. Mixed drinks severed from a Dixie cup. Not to mention everyone at bar was trashed along with wait staff."}
{"text":"Looks like a biker bar, but a family friendly oriented place. The best fish around, has been for decades! Good karoke, pool, and fun atmosphere! The other food is good, too."}
