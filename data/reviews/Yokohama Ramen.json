{"text":"Best ramen i have tried. Very nice customer service. Place which you probably will not wanna leave."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen close to home! I never knew this place existed until I was craving for some ramen and had to yelp out a place. We went on a Saturday around lunch time. The place was almost filled with people.   FOOD We ordered a chicken soup base with fried chicken cutlet and a shoyu (I'm sure I spelt it wrong) pork combo with fried chicken rice. Both were made so fresh, broth was excellent and blazing hot, chicken cutlet was freshly fried. Both orders were delicious. I'm definitely coming back here again and again. For the picky husband to say \"wow my first bite was so good\" is hard to get him to say that.   PARKING Plenty of parking, don't you worry.   CUSTOMER SERVICE They greet you when you come in and say bye when you leave. They do the same for every hungry customer who walks in. They saw that I was pregnant and gave me hot water instead of green tea which was very thoughtful of them. They would always walk by to see if your cup needs to be filled. There were 3 guys in the kitchen and 2 ladies on the floor.   Note for new parents: It will be a slight squeeze if you brought a stroller. There's two separate single doors when you walk into the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has stepped up their game. Their shio ramen is light and delicious. I do love ramen with a lot of flavor as well.... like ajisen. But I recommend this place. The kimchi ramen is my fav. The place is very clean and the staff is very friendly. Takoyaki was extremely delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stepping inside I heard Japanese music, which immediately made me smile thinking I was getting a real authentic experience. Then I hear Chinese voices and Hong Kong pop...  Overall the ramen was just \"ok\" but the broth was way too salty. I got assaulted by MSG.   At that price tag of over $10 a bowl I was expecting to get a bit more meat than two thinly sliced pieces of Japanese BBQ pork. Very disappointing.   Had I known I could have saved a few bucks and got a much larger (and satisfying) bowl of Vietnamese Pho.   Never going back."}
{"text":"Food was not too bad but that waitress was so rude. We don't want to visiting anymore and find another nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Visit 10 times, redeem once, a bowl of free ramen. Must spend $10 each visit. The quantity of each bowl is quite limited, spending over $10 should not be a problem. They give free Genmaicha tea though :)"}
{"text":"This is the first time I come to this raman place. The place looks new to me, I wonder if it is opened recently. I go there at lunch time today and the place is empty... not a good sign..  But I do crave for a hot bowl of ramen so what the heck I will give this a try. I ordered the miso ramen... and the food comes within 10 minutes.   The miso ramen is done in pork bone soup with miso of course, also with 2 pieces of pork, soft boiled eggs, corn, cabbage, and cloud ears. The pork is average, ok. The broth is really hot (temperature), which is good for ramen. The soft boil eggs do have a runny yolk, another good. The broth is flavourful with miso and have traces of pork bone flavour, ok. Just a note, the broth is not as strong flavourful as Sansotei but it's still acceptable. The price is $10.50 before tax for this bowl of ramen... Factoring in all these, it's a yummy bowl of ramen and considering it's also in my neighbourhood for easy access, bit above 3 stars in total.  In terms of services, maybe I am the only customer there, so things get done very quickly and prompt. No complaint there.. at least they didn't forget my order this time as other reviewer has pointed out. :)  I would go again based on the experience this time."}
{"text":"Not good, but not bad. Tasted homemade.  They serve lemon water.   I liked their soup, but the ramen was a bit off - not soft enough. It did come with a spring egg (normally you gotta order it). However, the meat was pretty thin.   I got the Kimchi Ramen and my dad got the Pork Ramen.   Pork was thin too - the fried layer was larger than meat.   Had to go get a small burrito after lol."}
{"text":"Broth was creamy and tasty. Price point was good. Takoyaki appetizer was great as well. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Ramen was good and we also tried the fried chicken, tasty.  We were there around 5 pm and they were not busy."}
{"text":"This is a small cozy place, the decor is simple and gives enough privacy.  The noodles were good and taste and not overly salty.  They are not anything memorable but they are no bad either.  it does the job for a ramen fix.   we also ordered the Japanese fried chicken  and it was nice, moist and hot.  again nothing to wow you.   If you need a ramen fix this would suffice."}
{"text":"Friendly service. The noodles were well cooked as well as the pork and eggs in my ramen. To me, the broth is what makes the ramen. The broth in the ramen that I had was on the saltier side. Although the consistency was nice and thick, you can definitely tell that a lot of MSG was put into the broth as it lacks that wholesome richness that well-made ramen broth has. Overall, not too bad of a place to grab ramen, although there are definitely better ramen shops out there."}
{"text":"This place is located in the same place as Loblaws and imagine cinemas, right between the fish and chips place and subway.  I was here to watch a movie and wanted a bite after and came across this place.  I would rate the overall food for what it is a solid 3.5. It's a pretty decent ramen place. Broth was flavorful and not overly salty. A decent variety of combinations of your typical ramen place. Noodles were decent and the pork was quite decent, not too fatty a bit more on the meaty side.  I got the combo that includes a bowl of rice on the side and chicken. The chicken was quite juicy and crunchy.  I wasn't wowed, but at the same time there want anything really negative about the place.  I would come back again when in the area. It's a solid \"decent\" for the price and what your getting"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. For those looking for a delicious bowl of ramen; here is the place!!! We have tried 5 of their ramens before this review and I want more people to go here to experience it as well :) amazing takoyaki too."}
{"text":"We came on Dec 31 with very low expectation because the score we read.  It is in our neighbourhood, so we thought to give it a try.  The shop was empty when we walked in at 2:30pm.  The service was ok, not bad or good.  The ramen was beyond our expectation.  We ordered shoyu and shio ramen. The soup is so delicious, the meat and egg are yummy too.  We will definitely come back very often."}
{"text":"THe food and servies was perfect  i was taking kimchi ramen and tokoyaji  good price on promotion"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the public rating for Yokohama Ramen continues to show low given all the recent high reviews.  I'm currently 3 months pregnant and this is pretty much my go to craving. Why? The soup is thick and delicious.  The noodles are the perfect chewiness.  The toppings are fresh and add to the mix.  I ordered recently to go, and was not disappointed. My husband was - there was nothing left."}
{"text":"The food is like shit . Especially the tofu. Not worth the try. Not coming back ."}
{"text":"My first ramen stop in Richmond Hill since I moved here and I am a fan!   I got the Yokohama Ramen with extra egg (bamboo, mushroom, green onion, fish cake, pork, seaweed) and my husband got the miso ramen with pork, both with pork bone broth. I've definitely had more flavorful broth before, but it was still very tasty, not too salty, with a nice garlic flavor.  The noodles had a good chew to them (though I wish there was just a LITTLE more noodles). I am a stickler for the egg, and they have it down perfectly. The pork was tender and smoky. We both cleaned our bowls and I was perfectly satisfied.  Good prices as well, and I even got a domestic beer for $1.99 with my ramen (sweet special!)  Would certainly visit again for my ramen fix."}
{"text":"Unimpressed service.  Lost my order. Eventually came after asking several times.  Unfortunately wasn't worth the wait as the ramen wasn't good."}
{"text":"I had their Yokohama ramen and BBQ pork with rice. I liked their BBQ pork with rice. Their sauce and toppings complimented the rice very well.  Ramen: I liked how they cooked their egg. Not too soft and not too hard. And their pork slices had a nice balance of meat and fat. However, I wasn't a big fan of their noodles and broth. The noodles were very similar to the wavy egg noodles I used to buy at a grocery store in Japan. It was just unremarkable. And I felt that their broth lacked depth and flavour.  I do however want to come back for their non-ramen items since their BBQ pork with rice was nice.  The staff was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Completely forgot my order made me wait 30 minutes, asked about my order and still nothing came, girl eventually came back and asked me to pay my bill .. lol  Just walked out"}
