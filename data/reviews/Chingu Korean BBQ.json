{"text":"What a fantastic experience. Warm atmosphere, delicious food, courteous and friendly staff. Thank you for making my birthday dinner a pleasant one!"}
{"text":"This place is really overrated, as many places are on yelp. Either that, or people have never had any better tasting buffet. Honestly, I can say that most of the good reviews here were heavily influenced by the friendly waiters. I know I have only written a few reviews compared to others with hundreds...but......what I say is true.  The place seemed very hesitate to give out lots of food. Every time we order salmon, only 4 pieces (1 person's portion came out). In other buffets, they would either ask how many portions/ give at least 2 portions for a group of people. Although the place had people coming in and out a lot, it was not filled up; only half of the tables were occupied. If anything's more trustworthy than yelp, it's the actual reality seen; the amount of people is a good indicator of how good the restaurant is. For example, despite the lower rating for Ten Ichi, you can see a crowd of people always lining up and waiting to eat there. It's a Japanese buffet, but their Korean food tastes better than Chingu. Chingu has a very limited amount of food selections, and I mean VERY limited. There are 3 choices of meat, 4 choices of soup, 3 choices of other plates. The galbi is hard and doesn't taste appealing. The soups are all terrible. Don't listen to what anyone here says; if you tasted good Korean soup (available in Toronto), or if you never tasted Korean soup before, either way, you would still be disappointed. The kimchi soup is very sour, the gamjatang tasted bad.....and the tofu soup.....if you want tofu soup to compare, go to Buk Chang Dong.... The part of the eating experience that surprised me the most was the ice cream. There were limited flavours of green tea, vanilla, chocolate, mango.... Anyways, the ice cream had no flavour and seemed to be filled with water as a large proportion. But....LIMITED 2 SCOOPS A PERSON??!?!? Do they think they're serving Haagen Diaz or some premium ice cream? Two scoops for crappy ice cream? I DO, however, agree with 1 thing that the yelpers say: It is indeed a much better choice than Chako....nevertheless......keep in mind that this is comparing \"one eye in a blind world\" -- bad vs. worst.  I find many of the reviews on yelp to be unreliable. The best indicator is to see how many people are willing to go to the restaurant in real life. I've seen this with my own eyes. However, I assure you that you can go see with your own eyes that what I say it in fact true. If you want a better experience, just go to Ten Ichi; for $32, you can eat so much more with much better taste, better desserts...better everything. $22 at Chingu is somewhat of a waste, though not completely. I'd prefer eating at home."}
{"text":"Best Korean AYCE BBQ in town! The wife and I have been here a couple of times now. The price is pretty standard for this type of restaurant.   The meat is delicious. It's marinated well and has lots of flavour. The typical sides are all there.   The service is great and the food comes quickly. This place is always packed so I suggest making reservations. Try it and you'll agree. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Finally a genuine Korean experience unlike the other nearby grill houses! The bulgogi is really juicy and there is a full array of side dishes (banchan) that are no worse than a regular Korean restaurant. I'd like to make a special note of the excellent service we received there - the waitress kept asking us if we needed another pitcher of cold water (no ice - they keep it in a fridge. Woohoo!). They regularly changed our grill without us even asking for it - how cool! I have been to numerous Korean restaurants, some of which I am told are as authentic as it gets, and Chingu comes very close, regardless of being an AYCE. The pork bone soup is fantastic. However, their pork belly, when grilled, becomes very chewy and barely edible. Hence, minus one star."}
{"text":"So sad this restaurant is no longer. I used to order the Bulgogi Beef special for lunch every couple of weeks, and I was very surprised when I came to pickup my food that it was different name. New place has bigger portions but doesn't taste the same :("}
{"text":"Came during lunch on a Tuesday. Looks like there are no dedicated waitstaff. Although the restaurant was not busy, the service level was strained. Food quality was okay, but not that great. Definitely not a shining example of Korean food."}
{"text":"All I have to say is this was the Worst experience ever. Really understaffing even on weekends when many people are waiting. Only one big table on the second floor fits more than 6 table. Around 2 small tables are not useable. So you better make a reservation before you go otherwise you will be waiting there for hours watching others eating. People leave but they serve extremely slow and clean the table. It's just long long waiting which doesn't worth the service that included in the bill. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AND WILL NOT GO AGAIN"}
{"text":"Don't bring your kids if they don't eat and you're having the AYCE. They will not be allowed to order a \"meal\" and must have the AYCE. 14.99 on weekends. And if you get ultimate, they will be upgraded to ultimate as well.Also a 15% \"service charge\" A 3 year old will be charged 12.99 and 14.99 on weekends plus a cost to upgrade to ultimate if you order it. The food was good, but I won't be going back as a result of this."}
{"text":"Love this place. My lunchtime staple: Bi Bim Bap (sometimes in a stone bowl for a treat, that makes the rice nice and crunchy). The food is simple and straightforward and very very tasty. And there's also the great starters that you get for free. Courteous service and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have been here once before and it was excellent! The food is delicious and fresh.   However, I was looking forward to returning again here tonight for dinner. I got to the restaurant with my fiance at 6:30pm. The restaurant was empty. There were about 3 small tables taken at the time. There were a few wait staff just standing around since it was quiet.   I requested a table for 2, but they said since we didn't have a reservation they needed to talk about it with the manager (I think). A few minutes later the server came back and said that \"I'm sorry, but everything is reserved for 7:00pm, there is no availability for 2 people right now\". I looked around, then looked back at him and was like \"You've got to be kidding me!\" The place was absolutely EMPTY.   I can understand if we were a big group wanting to come and eat, but it was just my fiance and I and only 10% of the tables were occupied at the time. This is very poor business and unacceptable. No restaurant should treat their paying customers in this manner.   I will NEVER return here and never recommend Chingu to anyone in the future."}
{"text":"Came here with co-workers for a late dinner. Servers were surprisingly amazing, they were quick and understanding. Weren't rude and looked like they hated their jobs. He had the regular dinner lunch AYCE and i must say, the quality of the meat was superb. The free appetizers were good and lots of variety.   It gets super busy around dinner time, but they have two floors - which is great. This place is great with groups. I highly recommend this Korean BBQ. Worth the try.   Reason for 4/5 - pork bone soup is disappointing & construction there makes the drive a pain.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food but unfortunately terrible service.  Used to be my go to place for kbbq uptown but the last 2 visits were a huge disappointment in service.  Quality of food is there on both visits but requests for water, rice, soup required multiple requests and the place wasn't even busy.  When they were on top of the service game I had no issue with them incorporating tip into the bill but now with the lousy service I wish I could have reduced the tip.  For now I guess I'll just stop going."}
{"text":"Usually fixed price all you can eat places are not my cup of tea. But I found this an enjoyable experience primarily due to the variety of food and the grill at the table approach. We got the ultimate ($21pp) and enjoyed the selection of meats and fish as well as a variety of veggie based sides in typical spicy Korean style.  The service is a bit spotty - family run kinda place. They advertise full bar - NOT. a very small selection of liquor (much of which not stocked - no vodka for instance) and no idea how to pour or mix a drink. Be prepared to stick to beer or a glass of cheap wine.  all told, if you out with a group and don't care about the drinking aspect other than to wash down the food, it can be an inexpensive, unusual  approach to Korean fare."}
{"text":"We came as a group after the snow storm in Toronto.  I think that was the reason they were a little short staffed, but they worked very hard was very friendly.  The were quick even though they were short staffed.  All the meats were very nicely marinated and the veggies were fresh.  The Korean appetizers were nice and spicey just the way I like it...I just wished I had room to finish all the apps.  When we came their heater broke down so they apologized and brought over a floor heater to try to warm the place up.  It wasn't really working but they tried.  Also they gave us a discount for that.  It was cold, but all of us enjoyed the food and the service.  The price was right and the place is nice and clean.  I'll go again for protein for sure!"}
{"text":"Several weeks ago, a group of hungry yelperinos, both new and old, gathered here for test the elasticity of our stomachs as we challenged Chingu on their AYCE Korean BBQ offering.  It's a touch hidden in the back corner of the plaza just off of Highway 7 on WEST Beaver Creek. It's deceivingly large inside, ample table space on main floor with a huge loft/mezzanine dining area above. It was mid week so the crowds were all but non-existent so getting a table was not a problem.   There were two options for dinner, basic and Super. $17.99 for the Basic AYCE dinner which was more than suffice. The Super was $20.99 and really when you're there for Bulgogi and Galbi (Beef Short ribs) all the other stuff is just fluff, and it's the extras that no one really wants to eat 4-5 plates of.  Accompanying accoutrements were standard but excellent, I really enjoy the Kimchi no matter where it's being fed to me. I seriously feel I could eat that S&*T on everything, eggs, fries, steak, cake, salad... like it's kind of my fave side.  A big thing for me here was that they offered Gamja Tang (sp?) (aka Pork Bone soup) as one of the AYCE soup options. It was good but not as good as some others I've had, but still AYCE PBS?!?!?! Hell's ya, I'll eat that ISH all day and night! However the Kimchi soup was to die for, I tried a sip of my friends and went straight to Korean heaven!  HUGE Bonus points for how efficient they were at changing our grills. Never had to ask once. They would walk over swap it even with food on it and transfer your cooking food to the new grill. This was done frequently and with little interruption to our meals. This little extra effort meant that we didn't leave smelling like BBQ and our food never got any black char on it!  Totally amazing service - Really enjoyed this place! Would eat here over Chako around the corner any day!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for AYCE Korean BBQ.  I only got thr regular menu (16.99 on weekdays and 18.99 on weekends) but it was more than enough I do not think the ulimate is worth it.  (I believe it was $3 more).  The meat is fresh and well seasoned, I especially love the spicy pork and the beef.    The service is the best you can get, waitress comes around changing the grill and picking up our empty containers quickly.  They changed our grill at least 5 times that night and we didn't even have to ask once.  Very impressive!!  You also get a TONS of side dishes as well. There was fish cake, jap chae, pickled relish, beansprouts, tofu and kimchi.  Not only that you get to have your own bowl of Pork bowl soup.  It was very tasty as well.  What diffs from other AYCE Korean BBQ is that you can order lettuce to wrap your meat in.  This is the first time I had Korean BBQ like this and found it tasty.  The only thing that I disliked was that they limit your ice-cream to 2 scoops.  And there was around 5 flavors. I would love to eat them all.   Overall, I will def be coming back to Chingu and filling my belly soon."}
{"text":"Location: Highway 7 on WEST Beaver Creek Pricing: $$-$$$ Service: thumbs up  I went several weeks ago with a friend for dinner (Total: $25ish/person). The overall verdict of this restaurant is above average. Unlike, other Korean BBQ around that area this is one of the most authentic and it has exceptional service.   This restaurant is more on the expensive side for dinner- but is is worth the money you paid for. Since, they offer Gamjatang (spice pork bone soup) as a part of all you can eat! They also offer a wide range of meats for the KBBQ; which is lovely for the meatatarians out there...  In addition, there is no extra cost for vegetables since it is apart of the package (bonus) and they have pretty decent side dishes.   You did not have to request the servers to change the grill, they would change it once so often without being asked. The service was quite efficient.   Highly recommended... =]"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday and unfortunately they were severely understaffed.  We actually had to clear our tables ourselves and served ourselves water because it was a while before they get back to us on anything.  The heating elements were badly lit so it took forever to cook our food and they were not prompt to change our elements so our food was charred.    The few things that were cooked that we had were good, sweet and sour chicken and dumplings.  I am sympathetic to their understaffing but at the same time they are not only selling food but also service so on that regard I will not come back again."}
{"text":"At the risk of being racist, I'm going to say that I absolutely can't stand Korean food made by Chinese people. There are several Chinese run KBBQ places in the city (namely Korean Grill House) and their quality is absolutely atrocious.   I love the value that I get from AYCE but I crave the quality of real KBBQ. Chingu strikes a happy medium between quality and value. First of all, having Korean owners is a massive plus to me. I mean if you had an Italian chef cook Chinese food you'd question its authenticity right? Second of all, this is the only KBBQ restaurant in GTA I know that serves tons of side dishes. They also give you unlimited lettuce (for wrapping), and they even serve unlimited soup. All these side dishes and wrappings and soups makes it feel like a much more authentic Korean meal. The soups taste pretty good and the portion is small enough to be just a sample so you get focus on the main courses - the meat. And if you really don't want to eat a ton of meat, you can order more Kimchi stew.   I love their selection of meats. Beef short ribs is probably the best thing since sliced bread. Aside from that, they also have spicy pork, and chicken. They even have pork belly. If you pay a few extra bucks, you can upgrade and get seafood items as well. I like their flavoring on the spicy pork because it actually tastes like Korean seasoning. They also have ice cream which is a great way to get that greasy feeling out of your mouth after chowing on so much meat.   For $19, this AYCE place is a steal. Although I have to admit real KBBQ tastes much better, the price difference is far too much. Real KBBQ often cost upwards of $25 per SERVING of meat which is usually around 300-400 grams.   The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because they auto charge you 15% tip, and the grills they use are very prone to turning black. I've tried other places with more \"high tech\" grills. The grills at Chingu are definitely not as good but to compensate, their staff are happy to change the grill often.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing, the staff is so nice and friendly, looks like a korean family running the place. the inside is a lot bigger than it seems form the outside, it has 2 floors. The all you can eat korean BBQ is a great price, with lots of selection. you also get to choose soups (pork bone soup, tofu soup etc) there is hot menu items, dumplings, tariyaki salmon, sushi (with meat) etc besides the usual korean BBQ meats / fish. great place to come with friends and cook together, especially if your really hungry they will just keep bringing you more food!"}
{"text":"We go to Chingu for the lunch specials which are priced around $5.99 to $7.99.  We get a good variety of small favorful side dishes initially before the main course.  I highly recommend their bibimbap with lots of fresh vegetables and beef.  The service is always fast and friendly.  If you are up around Thornhill or Richmond Hill and do not want to bother driving down to Little Korea in North York, then head to Chingu."}
{"text":"The time I went here, I tried the set dinner and both my boyfriend and I got an upset stomach. Definitely will not go back again."}
{"text":"Great service. They replaced the grill every few minutes.  That alone gets them four stars."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: the place is nicely spacious, and clean, has two levels, friendly staff   Food: AYCE KBBQ, probably the best in my opinion so far (compared to Chako, Korean Grill house) offer a variety of side dishes, the meat is marinated very flavourful, their GAMJATANG is decent for AYCE, their kimchi soup though on the hand was super sour. I couldn't even full drink a spoonful. Spicy pork meat was absolutely delicious! They also offer vegetables and ice cream for dessert!   Price:  Mon- Thurs 17.99 for dinner regular menu  Fri-sun 19.99 for dinner for regular menu Additional 2.00 for the supreme menu   Overall: I'll definitely be back, whenever I get KBBQ cravings!"}
{"text":"yummm. i recently ate dinner here because all the other korean bbq restaurants in the area had a long wait time and my friends and i were starving! the staff were very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was relaxed. the food was delicious...our favourites were the marinated beef and the spicy chicken dish.  we all got the deluxe all you can eat dinner which was $18.99, but there was also a cheaper option.   they have only been open for six months and don't seem to be too popular yet, but it's only a matter of time. Our server said her grandmother was the chef, which is pretty neat!"}
{"text":"I've been to so many Korean BBQ places now that sometimes - I get sick of them.  Mainly because it's usually Chinese-owned, and it's the same thing every single time.  However, not here!    I went with my friends last night to Chingu - the first thing I noticed was that it was Korean owned!  I was happy to see that.  Price was good: $16.99 per person.  You get unlimited banchan (including kimchi, cucumbers, bean sprouts, the usual), spare ribs, spicy pork, squid, fish, vegetables, etc.  But the great thing is this: all you can eat pork bone soup, and kimchi chigae!  I was very happy to se that.  Service was efficient and great - they came by often to check if we wanted more food; they came by often to change our grills; and they came by often to add more water.  I really can't complain about this place.  I would definitely recommend coming here for Korean BBQ than across the street at Korean Grill House!"}
{"text":"Recently went with my friends to Chingu - at first I thought it was one of those Chinese owned Korean Restaurant but when I sat down, I realized it was owned by Korean people.     Price was good: $16.99 per person on week days and that's the regular menu, I believe there's one for $19.99 per person which includes salmon.  I must say you get unlimited appetizer dishes (including kimchi, spicy cucumbers, bean sprouts, cold tofu and the usual).  The combo also includes spare ribs, spicy pork, squid, fish, vegetables, and many more.  But the great thing that's also included in your price is all you can drink Korean soup especially the pork bone soup which was very tasty !!  Service was efficient and great - they came by often to change the grill and see if we wanted to add more food.    I would strongly recommend coming here for Korean BBQ, as well they have 5 different ice cream flavors to choose from not just green tea.  Good reasonable price, good service and great food !!!"}
{"text":"This is THE ONLY KBBQ place I will eat at now. I have had bad experiences with a lot of korean bbq places. Including lack of quality, lack of variety, horrible service and food poisoning that I experienced at Chako (YES I COOKED MY FOOD CORRECTLY, my first order was muscles and within 20 minutes I was throwing up in Chako's bathroom). OK SO TMI, anyways... I was really done with kbbq, but when I had to go for a birthday celebration I slowed myself into it and the food was GREAT. No food poisoning, AMAZING service (That means you Phil, YOU ARE GREAT) AND AYCE GAMJATANG, JAPCHAE AND POTATO SALAD. AHHHH I love this place and will continue to come here for special occasions."}
{"text":"Best pork bone soup in town. High quality kbbq that is actually owned by Koreans"}
{"text":"Came here with some of my fellow Yelpers for a Korean BBQ CMYE a couple weeks back.  This Korean BBQ joint is nuzzled in one of the plazas in the W Beaver Creek/Hwy 7 area. Looking at it from the outside you would never guess how big it is on the inside! Two floors, with lots of space and tables that can accommodate quite a few people. If you're in a larger group (8-10 or so) they have a few tables that have more than one grill so you can all sit and enjoy in a meat feast together!  Service was top notch. Very attentive and they were super quick with changing our grills (we didn't even need to ask!) One of my biggest complaints is at most Korean BBQ places you need to flag the server down to change it for you, and usually by that time, the grill is caked with black burntness. Major points for being on top of the grill changes (and our party had quite a few of them!)  Food was delicious. You have two all you can eat choices here: the standard, which comes with your basic selection of meats/fish/chicken, and they also have a deluxe version that for a few bucks more you get a few extras like dumplings, shrimp, sweet & sour chicken, and some other miscellany items. We all went with the basic. The Kalbi ribs were a HUGE hit with our party and I lost count of the amount of trays of that stuff we ate! Omnomnom. They also give you lettuce leafs that you can wrap you meat in! Awesome, I wish all Korean BBQ places did this!  In addition to the AYCE meats, you get your choice of soup (FREE, included with the AYCE price!!). I had the pork bone soup and it was fantastic! Highly recommended. The pork was so tender and just falling off of the bone and the flavours of the soup were delicious.  This is a great place if you're looking to venture outside of the generic/more popular Korean BBQ places. I'd say it's my favourite Korean BBQ place out of any that I've been to. Worth checking out & stuffing your face at!"}
{"text":"I went to Chingu with a Korean friend for lunch on a weekday. Since we were both hungry, we dove right into the all-you-can-eat menu. I was surprised that the price for all-you-can-eat is the same for lunch and dinner. I guess it's a better deal for dinner then? Nevertheless, I was decently satisfied with the overall meal.   The Korean side dishes that came was delicious. I liked how we were allowed to refill them. There was red kimchi, fish cake, jap chae, beansprouts, tofu and some kind of cucumber dish. I might be missing one or two dishes and I have to add- the tofu and fish cake (o deng) was my favourite!   With the regular all-you-can-eat menu, there was a good variety of food. The bulgogi was only decent but the galbi (short ribs) was amazing! The samgyubsal (pork belly) and chicken was good. The fish was frozen when it came out so I did not enjoy that. It also came with a big dish of lettuce and a dish of spicy vegetables for us to wrap our meat with. It was different for me and I enjoyed it. There was also a choice of jigae (stew) and I picked the kimchi jigae and my friend had the daengjang jigae. I was very disappointed in the kimchi jigae. There was a layer of oil on top and the taste was off. My Korean friend said the daengjang jigae was okay, nothing too special. To finish off the meal, we had ice-cream.  The server was very friendly and he made jokes with us during the meal. He often changed the grill for us which I greatly appreciated. He even took out more meat and cold water for us when he noticed we were nearly finished.   Overall, the meal was an enjoyable one. However, I was a little grossed out when I found hair in my o deng (fish cake) and I was not happy with the 15% service charge inputted in the bill.   Would I go back? Yes I would, but not for all-you-can-eat lunch. I will try their lunch menu which I noticed was a great deal, starting from $5.99!"}
{"text":"authentic korean bbq. and it's all u can eat. whats better than this?  good food good service. will come again for sure."}
{"text":"the best ayce korean bbq to be had in the city. i believe outdoes chako and korean grillhouse. pricing is a bit steep with no night specials available. however, does come with choice of soft tofu soup, kimchi soup and pork bone soup. amazing banchan (appetizers), lettuce (to wrap up the meat), bulgogi (yes very well marinated), spicy pork (drools, very tasty and well marinated), chicken (tender and gd), short ribs (gd as well), pork belly (not gd quality at all)  btw, service amazing, they change the grill without asking, come to check on you and even just glance at the grill or at the table to make sure everything is gd!  LOOOOVE it.  highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Best bone in pork soup. Has a nice kick to it. Great variety with dinner. Not a big fan of the dumplings or breaded shrimp so probably didn't need to go with the Ultimate option."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Although the ultimate all you can eat is a tad on the expensive side (almost $30 after tax and tip) the food you get to order is quite amazing. Unlimited banchan, different types of soup (tofu, kimchi, pork bone) and lots of hot food items on top of the kbbq meats for grilling.   We had about 20 people people altogether and we were given the 2nd floor. No AC whatsoever. You can imagine how hot it was for 20 ppl to grill food at their table without any cooling system besides a fan blowing from afar. That really took away the experience a little. The service was a little slow - they didn't have enough people working to accommodate this many people at one but they tried. Definitely one of the better kbbqs!"}
{"text":"Spectacular!  AYCE Korean BBQ is simply unbeatable, and this place has it down!  WHen my wife and I were dating, we visited this place 13 years ago while in town.  She and I both could not wait for a return visit.  The return visit happened this past week, and it did not disappoint.  We brought friends who had never tried Korean food, and they are now converts.  Quality may not be the highest, but at the prices they charged, the food was certainly more than adequate.  This is a must try!  On a side note, if you are put off by the automatic service charge, and / or have concerns that the wait staff do not directly receive the incremental charge, simply decline it.  Leave cash on table for the waiter / waitress."}
{"text":"This ayce Korean bbq place is great and authentic.  Unlike other \"Korean\" bbq place close by, Chingku provides good quality meat, deliciously marinated and offers plenty of side dishes and even soups.  Their pork bone soup is decent, I mean you can't really complain when you get good Korean bbq meat AND soup...winner.  Their kalbi is good quality and their bulgogi is also marinated well.  I'm not a huge fan of their pork, but their chicken is very tasty.  They have two options for dinner, one with extra seafood and another which is their standard (priced 20.99 and 17.99 respectively for weekdays and I think two dollars more for Friday and weekends). The service here is friendly and attentive.  They will happily change out your grill or add more water whenever necessary."}
{"text":"Chingu Korean BBQ's Lunch Specials for $5.99!   7 choices for the regular menu which are 2 dollars cheaper during lunch time and there are a few bento boxes selections.   Service wise is quick and efficient.. I finished my lunch in less than 20 minute.   All lunch includes miso soup and banchans.   Bimbimbap I ordered was A-OK! Beef was tender and marinated in Korean sauce with a hint of seasame oil. Good mixture of both pickled and fresh vegetables. Though I found it better to be served in a hot stone pot but I found this version acceptable too.   I think I want to be back to try out the Kimchi/Pork Bone/Tofu soup which are all for $5.99 during lunch specials.   Good place for a cheap lunch date!"}
{"text":"Delicious Korean BBQ... Check.   Convenient Location... Check.   Nice tables and deco... Check. Quality bbq inserts (that get frequently switched)... Check.   Nice attentive staff... Check.  It had it all... and the AYCE is just the cherry on top.  Great prices.   This is now the place that I will go when my stomach cries out \"I WANT ME SOME KOREAN BBQ\"  The only thing that was sort of strange is the large mounted TV on the wall playing the news... I felt it took away from the ambiance slightly.  But I suppose there is nothing wrong with being informed.    But the big question... would I go back?  I can say with 100% certainty that I will be back.  Hmmm... Korean BBQ sounds delicious actually.  Maybe I'll go tonight!   This place is recommended."}
