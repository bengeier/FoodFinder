{"text":"When you're counting the minutes until your next break at work, a half hour seems like forever. Unfortunately it doesn't seem as long when that's all you get for lunch. Luckily Dagwoods is a short walk from building 1620 where I spend most of my week.   The deli on the bottom floor of this corporate complex is hidden away from anyone who doesn't work in the vicinity, but has a nice selection, quick service and an outdoor patio perfect for eating lunch next to it's mini-at-ure lake.   Try the supreme sandwich if you are into turkey, bacon and avocado or the spicy chicken wrap if you dig a spicier lunch. Hungry in the morning? Don't worry! I hear they have a make your own breakfast burrito option. I have yet to try that, but it is a hit with everyone in my department. If you pick a side I would stay away from the macaroni, its mayo packed.   Pros: Speed, selection, patio, beverage selection (including multiple teas and energy drinks if you are hungover and trying to power through your shift)  Cons: A little too pricey for a sandwich or wrap. Chains are less expensive, but Ill pay the price for convenience and the chance to stick it to conglomerates."}
{"text":"It's very convenient for the people like me who work in the building. The food is decent depending on what you get. I find that they don't typically use the freshest produce/veggies but most of the sandwiches are much better than the salads. They are typically understaffed. The lady working there is super nice but never seems to have any help."}
{"text":"Now that the original owners are back at this location, all is happy!  This is not a gourmet establishment but for what they serve (lunch deli), they do a great job and offer friendly service.  The seating is ample, they have both indoor and outdoor along a pond.  Their BLT is fantastic, never scrimping on the bacon.  Though it would be nice to have a food establishment be more creative in an office park, I realize the costs are likely prohibitive."}
{"text":"The short: Somewhat reasonably priced sandwiches as long as you get all the fixings that come with an order. The young ladies working the counter are friendly and eager to please, though orders come out slowly as the crowd gets thick around lunchtime--there's only one woman making sandwiches and one woman making the specialty coffees. There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and you can move the small cafeteria-style tables around to accommodate groups. It caters to employees in the attached and nearby office buildings, so it's open only for breakfast and lunch.  The long: Two words--Breakfast burrito. Fill a big white tortilla with a hearty row of \"great way to start your day\" (in other words, eggs, cheddar, and sausage--or bacon, if you want to celebrate another great porcine form), but don't stop there! Oh no. Push it over the top. This will make you smile at everyone you meet for the next 24 hours: throw that sucker onto a Panini machine. And please, don't forget the salsa. Sure, it's from a jar, but it's just enough red and acid to puncture the cholesterol you're about to coat your arteries with. The Reuben's another good get. Not the best, and it can get messy if you let it sit around too much, with the Italian dressing (that's right, I'm no purist, and I'll take Italian if that's what there is) soaking through the bread, but it's a good stand-in when you can't stop by New York for lunch to get an authentic deli sandwich. They're more than willing to custom make a sandwich for you, top to bottom--just let them know. If you're in a rush, as I usually am when I run over there from my office, I call my order in, and it's ready in 10 minutes. The coffee is decent, though the recently opened Starbucks stole some of their thunder with their \"big name\" drinks (not necessarily with quality, and certainly not with value.   There's also a small selection of grab-and-go items if you're in a rush: baked/breakfast goods (muffins, cookies, rice krispie squares, brownies, bagels); packaged oatmeal with granola and sometimes fruit on top; packaged salads with a handful of different dressings; and a basket of fruit.  There's a breakfast and lunch special every day, as well as coffee specials, that make the place well worth visiting once in awhile."}
{"text":"I really, really, really want to like this place. Why? Because it's on the first floor of my office building, making it the perfect location for those days I've been too rushed to eat breakfast or when I'm too caught up in work to leave for lunch. Unfortunately, the location (and friendly service) are about all this place has to offer.   The espresso drinks aren't half bad - in fact, my Americano was comparable to that at most other coffee places - but the veggie sandwich I had was atrocious. First of all, it had random veggies like black olives and shredded carrots that don't usually appear on veggie sandwiches. At least in 2008, vegetarian items are expected to be as interesting and tasty as meat-based dishes, and someone ordering a veggie sandwich is expecting hearty vegetables like asparagus, mushrooms, or artichokes not the toppings from a house salad. As if the veggie selection weren't bad enough, everything was absolutely drowning in mayo and the bread was dry. Not good. Not good at all.  Dagwood's definitely has convenience going for it, but I'd rather drive 2-3 minutes and get a great sandwich at Wildflower, the Vig, or Bertha's."}
{"text":"This deli is on the ground floor of the building right next to my office, and has yet to deliver a bad meal (to me or that I've heard from anyone I work with).  They serve Boars Head meat & Cheese, and always have a daily special. I've yet to have breakfast there so I'll leave that to someone else.  The 1st time I went there I got the Ruben and it was really tasty. The meat was just the right temperature and just the right amount of sauce & kraut. I liked it so much I got it the 2nd time too!  They have a small selection of side, including salads and fruit, as well as the usual grab bag size chips. To drink they have a soda fountain (Coke products) and also a cooler that has a lot of things you could find in a convenience store. I suggest the Key Lime Stewart's myself..."}
{"text":"I thought I had the address wrong the first time I went here.  This is a huge corporate complex - where the heck is the sandwich shop?  I decided to give it a shot and parked in the parking garage.  As I walked in I was REALLY taken with the amazing landscaping/fountains/hidden conversation spots all around the outside of the building.  I wanted to get a job in the building so I could eat my lunch outside there every day.  So I walked into the building and... nothing.  No signs of Dagwood's.  Then I realized that right in front of me was an area w/ small tables, a sofa and some nice sitting chairs facing a tv.  I had to ask someone when they walked out if that was Dagwood's.  It was.  So I walked in and went to the side to find that the entrance for Dagwood's is officially at the back of the building - but even there I couldn't find a sign.    A really amazing selection of sandwiches.  They had SO many options.  And they do breakfast - gotta love that.  The sandwich was good and all, but my favorite part was walking outside to eat (I love Phoenix! - My first time here was November and I've eaten outside in December and January too!) where I found some round shaded tables where I could eat lunch while looking out at their fake-lake with ducks swimming back and forth.  Not bad for 5 minutes away from a very industrial part of Tempe.  If you work in the area, it's definitely worth a stop."}
