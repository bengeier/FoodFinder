{"text":"Even though I'm a white girl from the suburbs who grew up on boiled potatoes, I can't get enough spicy West and East Indian food.   I've been going to The Jerk Box for over a year now and when they see me walk in, they already know I'm going to have a medium curry goat with rice and peas and coleslaw and extra gravy ($9). It's so fattening - especially the goat - but I don't care. It's enough food to keep me full all day but I always eat it all (with almost a whole bottle of pepper sauce).   There's always a line up so be prepared to wait a while but that's a good sign that it's worth it. The soup of the day is always delicious and it seems like everyone orders a soup. The jerk chicken is also super popular.   They don't have a lot of seating, but it's totally normal to sit with other people and start up a conversation while you eat. I see a lot of the same people when I go so it's kind of like I have a crew LOL.   This is easily my favourite restaurant even though it's so far away from me. I usually park on a side street and walk in because the parking out front is tricky - as the other reviewer pointed out.   Hope you give it a try!"}
{"text":"A few tables and horrible parking situation going on in front... Think of jenga near the end of the game... pile up!  That being said the 5* is for the food! Jerk chicken, bbq chicken, goat curry, festival, chicken foot soup,  dumplings and oxtail! All flavorful,  fresh and spicy :) service is good and sometimes fun!  You have choice of white rice or rice and peas!  Service is fast and prices are amazing! But they don't make some of the stuff in the morning!"}
{"text":"There's like no menu or cards to indicate what the food is. Whatever they have is orated to you by women with thick Jamaican accents.   I have no idea what I actually ordered because I just said \"Yea I want that\" after asking them to repeat what they said like 5 times and started feeling like I was becoming annoying and holding up the line.   Food was good although quite greasy. The porridge they give with every order was a bit too sweet but tasty and for the price it was a good deal.  Wouldn't mind coming back if I'm in the area."}
