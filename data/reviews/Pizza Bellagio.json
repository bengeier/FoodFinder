{"text":"The fettuccine alfredo was VERY watery. It had just enough flavor to be edible. Not a satisfying meal whatsoever. The only reason they're getting two stars was for the 10 minute wait from order to pick up."}
{"text":"Just ordered from there the guy on the phone was very nasty we had called and ask to cancel an order within three minutes of placing it it was a calzone he said it was already made like really so he canceled the whole order it was one of the nastiest attitudes I have heard in a while I would never order from there again"}
{"text":"horrible customer service. i was there sat with my boyfriend and the manager (as he told the lady on the phone he was) was yelling on the phone at customer he had hung up on in front of us..she apparently called back and he screamed at her to stop calling.  i wanted to leave so we started walking out , he approached us and apoligized but once in he started screaming at the delivery guy..we booked it out of there and today i called from work to get a delievery and maybe avoid any issues they have at the restuarant and they tell me they have cancelled some of there delivery areas and mine was one of them and then he hung up on me!! pizzzas not that good."}
{"text":"Never order food from this restaurant. My girlfriend and I order pizza around 11 pm one night hoping to get a good late night snack. An hour and a half later, the delivery man finally arrived with our barely warm pizza and undercooked mozzarella sticks.   This wait for delivery might be acceptable if I lived 10-20 miles from the pizza shop. But I live 1.3 miles, and somehow it took 90 minutes. I could've walked there and back twice before getting my pizza delivered.   It is a shame because the pizza, although barely warm, didn't taste half bad. But, considering the insane wait I endured, I will never order food from establishment again."}
{"text":"I'm very eh on this.  The burger I ordered was good, at least, which a lot of pizza places can't say, but delivery took forever-- I waited almost two hours, so by the time it arrived, the fries needed to be reheated in the oven, and they forgot the drinks I had ordered.  When I called to ask for them, they said they were busy and they'd \"drop them off later.\"  So, whatever.  Food was good; service, not so much."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place several times for co-workers.  The last time I ordered from the place they sent the burgers without any of the toppings I had asked for and the burgers were very overcooked and hard.  When I called to tell them that they didn't put the items on ANY of the burgers and they were overcooked, the owner said that they had made the burgers exactly as I had ordered them.  I protested that they were not made as I had ordered.  I told him that when I had ordered the burgers that the guy taking my order seemed to be having trouble putting the toppings in the computer and had asked someone for help entering it in the computer.  I know what I asked for on each burger and a co-worker even heard me placing the order.  Gee... if they cook them as ordered, did I order them overcooked and like a jerky patty too??  I told him that the last few times we have ordered that the food has been very overcooked and if this was going to continue we would not order there anymore.  He said that he had upsized the pizza that was ordered from a personal (6 inch) to a small (10 inch) as a show of gratitude for our business.  I didn't call about the pizza, I called about the burgers.  Also, no one told me that it was a larger pizza than what was ordered... it wasn't my pizza.  How am I supposed to know that it was larger??  Do I sit there with a tape measure when the food comes in and measure it?  NO.  He seemed to think that I should have known that this was an act of gratitude.    The owner was very loud, obnoxious, and unapologetic.  He took no responsibility for the incorrect and overcooked food.  I will not be ordering from them ever again.  He doesn't deserve our business.  Food is subpar and customer relations is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"I have had them a few times and the food isn't bad.. However, I ordered from there for the last time a few days ago. I made an order for delivery even though I lived only about a block away. I was watching my sick mother so I didn't want to leave the house. When the food arrived, he told me my total and asked for cash when I had already paid by card over the phone. He got a bit aggravated but then asked if I wanted to \"add anything to the bill\". I though this was a strange question and replied \"no\". He basically threw my food at me and stormed off in a swearing fit and I heard him scream \"walk to pick it up yourself next time!\" As I closed the door.. This had me confused for a while until I realized that he was probably asking for a tip. I felt bad after I realized it, but it's their mistake.. Plus there was no reason to throw a temper tantrum.."}
{"text":"Despicable customer service. Ordered around 6pm--now after 7pm and the delivery driver \"couldn't find\" the address (stated twice over the phone). The employees shout on the phone; the manager said a man called the first time (last time I checked I'm not a man) and was simply rude. Manager wanted to recount what I'd done wrong instead of offering a solution. If I could rate this place 0/5 I would."}
{"text":"9/7/2013  We ordered a couple of 10-inch pizzas to be delivered to our hotel.  One was mainly a veggie pizza; the other, a meat pizza.  The order arrived within the time specified.  However, the pizzas were only warm - not hot as they should be.  The meat pizza was a bit on the greasy site.  The paper it sat on was saturated.  The crusts on both pizzas were a bit tough, but tasted okay.  Maybe eating at the restaurant would be an improvement, but I would not order a pizza for delivery.  The delivery person was okay - just your your average worker doing his job.  The price was reasonable and not out of line."}
{"text":"This place is the worst!  I literally signed up for Yelp just so I could save other people from having to experience this dump.    When I called in to order, a loud phone kept ringing in the background, and the person taking my order kept brusquely ordering me to \"HOLD ON!\"  I had to repeat my credit card number about 5 times because it \"wasn't valid\" the first 4 times.  So you can imagine how I might have doubted the delivery person's claim that my cell phone \"didn't work\" when he tried to call me.  The delivery man also reprimanded my father-in-law, who tried to take the pizza from his hands: \"DON'T DO THAT YET!\"  Maybe he thought we were going to snatch the food and abscond into the bowels of Presbyterian hospital without signing the credit card receipt.  The food was mediocre.  Pizza was barely above room temperature with congealed cheese.  For some reason the wing sauce was served in a separate cup instead of being put on the wings.  Nobody hated their food, but I'm pretty sure we won't remember it tomorrow.  The celery (which was included at an additional $.69 per wing order, despite my never requesting it) was FILTHY.  It was literally covered with dirt that I could scrape off with my finger nail.  That is reason enough never to return.    I don't always travel to Pittsburgh, but when I do, I will NEVER darken the doors of Pizza Bellagio."}
{"text":"Pizza was what I expected. I ordered last night, 4/7/15 at 11:15 pm thru grub hub. The second half of my pizza tasted like dish liquid.I didn't taste a slice of what tasted bad well into the morning 3:00 am. I called today 4/8/15 to speak to a supervisor and he was absolutely the rudest restaurant owner I have ever encountered. Practically accused me of lying and questioned why I didn't call yesterday or earlier this morning even though i doubt it would've made a difference. With all the pizza shops in this area pizza bellagio will not be missed from my menus. Order here at your own risk and hope everything turns out because if not you will undoubtedly be blame for whatever the issue is."}
{"text":"I ordered a large deep-dish pizza online, and scheduled it to be delivered several hours later. While it did arrive exactly on time, it was cold and completely bland. It tasted like store-bought tomato sauce, atop a boring crust. I also specifically stated in the special instructions section that I wanted it to be well-done, and it wasn't. For the price ($23.97 for the pizza, plus tax and a $3.00 delivery fee), I expected much better. All in all, a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"First time ordering delivery of of grub hub.   Overall delivery took about 70 minutes.  I called to make sure my order wasn't misplaced or something after the 50-55 minute wait predicted by grub hub.  Got a bored sounding slightly rude lady on the phone who basically spoke to me in one word mini phrases.   Anyway result is that my food did get here and the delivery driver was super nice and courteous.    My actual order was pretty good.   I ordered a gluten free meatball and tomato pizza.  The crust was super thin like a thick tortilla but nicely crisped. There was a good ratio of tasty meatball to tomato per piece.  My boyfriend got the regular medium Pizza, and let me tell you it's a very generous portion size.  However it is nothing special.   His wings were a little odd as the honey bbq sauce came on the side, but they weren't bad.  I'll consider ordering again... But I'd probably get a meatball hoagie instead"}
{"text":"Pizza always good. I got broccoli bites once and they were very very gross. Also didn't get the ranch I requested. I called back and politely asked if I could get something else or something complimentary next time. (We order there at least once a week at our business) owner was mad and said absolutely not. I said ok we probably won't order again are you sure. He said that's your choice and hung up. So rude!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Fast delivery.  Pizza Bellagio tastes the same and has an almost identical menu to Mia Pizza and Pizza Bellino.  But Pizza Bellagio has free delivery and most items on the menu are like $1 less than Mia Pizza and Pizza Bellino.  The pizza's are huge, I love getting pepperoni with garlic sauce.  Most of the other reviewers are negative and saying the staff is rude.  I've ordered from Bellagio like 10 times, and never had a problem with anyone being rude at all."}
{"text":"Ordered from here a few times out of convenience, but honestly, I won't do it again. The wait times are horrible and the food is mediocre--the meatballs were super gross (old?) last time I got them. And that lady on the phone? Short/rude every time. I'm not sure how they are still in business."}
{"text":"The worst experience I have ever had with Grubhub or a restaurant. Food arrived after two hours. That's right - TWO HOURS. We had to chase the driver down the street for the other half of our order. Food was rock hard and cold. Pizza was not even lukewarm, and mozzarella sticks were literally still frozen in the middle. The bag all the food was in was dripping wet also. Somehow, with all the hot food being cold, the soda we ordered managed to be warm. Restaurant (Pizza Bellagio) and Grubhub did not even refund the order, even after being on chat with customer service for over 45 minutes waiting for my order to arrive and being told \"the driver will be arriving in five minutes,\" 40 minutes beforehand. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"DRIVER SHOWED ME HIS GUN! We ordered a pizza last night and the driver couldn't find my house. He called me and I was giving him directions, then met him at the end of my driveway. He gives me my pizza then goes to his front seat and picks up his gun to show me that he had it because he was worried about my area. I live in Shaler, up a big hill that starts off with just trees and a road until you get to the residential part. I didn't ask him to meet me in the woods and I told him to drive up the wooded hill and windy road and he would get to my street where I was waiting by myself with just my phone in hand for my pizza. He absolutely did not have to show my that he had a gun! I was not a threat to him! Please never order from here! I understand pizza delivery drivers have gotten robbed, killed, assaulted. But I surely couldn't have been a threat to this man who happened to be the OWNER!! when I called to report what happened, I asked to speak to the owner and the guy on the phone said that the man who delivered my pizza was the owner. I also filed a police report. Absolutely the worst experience with ordering pizza! I'm appalled and honestly, still shaken up."}
{"text":"This definitely is not your fast food chain burger.  Yes, I did say burger.  Yes, it came from a pizza place.  Yes, it was amazing.  While browsing the menu I was surprised myself to see that they had burgers listed.  Plain burger, cheeseburger and bacon cheeseburger, and a burger combo, complete with fries and a soda for a reasonable price.  I expected a run of the mill skinny patty thrown on a bun two sizes to big for it.  What a got was a fairly thick patty that fit the bun.  The size was quite surprising.  Toppings were less than awe inducing.  Lettuce, tomato and onion.  Of course they send the condiments on the side as to not make the bun soggy (great idea).  The fries served with it were just the right amount to make sure you were full with the size of the burger you got.  I think I will definitely be coming back for a burger here more often."}
{"text":"Awesome owners and fantastic food. Reasonably priced and great service."}
{"text":"They keep sending out outdated coupons via mail. When I call them to order the lunch special #4 that was listed $5.99 was actually close to $7.00. It's just annoying. STOP SENDING OUT THE OUTDATED COUPONS WITH LOWER PRICE ON THE MENU! IT\"S A FRAUD AND ITS CALLED \"FISHING\" ---- that's what you're doing Bellagio, even if it's a mistake."}
{"text":"My experience here was ALL AROUND TERRIBLE today. I was told 45min on the delivery of my hoagie and slice of cheesecake food came in 1hr 30min. I called in several times and was told the driver was close asked for a manager and was told manager wasn't available. When the food finally came The slice of cheesecake was a puddle of ingredients. The hoagie was soggy and falling apart. When I called in the speak to a manager and the manager wasn't available again. I wasn't offered a remake or my money back please save you time don't order here"}
{"text":"SO RUDE! I ordered multiple ranches with my pizza. When I got the pizza there was only one ranch and it had spilled all over the pizza. Pizza was cold. When I called to complain I said I would pay for more ranches the lady refused and said \"why does it matter if it spilled, you're gonna eat it with ranch anyways\" so rude. Will not order again."}
{"text":"Their salads are amazing!! Definitely worth what you pay for, staff is a little rude though. I ordered one night before they were closing and the driver ended up getting lost downtown so it took him about 45 minutes with my salad just trying to find the Westin convention center. I politely told them the salad was soggy so I didn't want it anymore. The guy started yelling at me 6 month pregnant so I hung up and he called my phone back trying to yell some more. when I called back to speak to a supervisor he wouldn't transfer me over"}
{"text":"This place is the worst! We just ordered from here and the pizza was cold. Not the kind of cold from seating in the car but not fully cooked.  When we called, we were told that's the way the pizza is and we just wanted our money back because we didn't like the pizza. We even offered to bring the pizza in and they said of course it would be cold by the time it got there,  but in this heat,  it would probably be hotter than what we got.  Very rude customer service. Don't eat from here!"}
{"text":"They are TERRIBLE!!!! ..... LIKE...... Usually I leave mom and pop style places out the convo when comparing to chain restaurants because its like comparing Apples to Oranges in terms of quality. Chains will almost always be less in quality because they  often focused on volume over quality. With that said, this place is worse than the worse CHAIN PIZZA you can buy - whatever That may be!"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  But...their delivery times are really bad.  Every time I order, they give an estimated time (usually 45-60 minutes which is fair because we don't live all that close to the shop). It has, on multiple occasions, taken over two hours for the pizza to arrive.  When it takes that long (and the pizza is cold) I figure that we would be offered an apology or potentially a coupon. I have never gotten either (though I haven't asked either).   I've never called to complain about the time it takes, so maybe this is on me, but it takes way too long to get a pizza from this place.   The pizza is good, but it isn't wait 2 hours good."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza at 4:00 before the Steeler game. I wanted a large half xtra cheese half onions, peppers , tomatoes , bannana peppers. They have me a pizza with all xtra cheese, onions, peppers mushrooms no bannana peppers. I called they acted liked I didn't know what I was talking about. Do not order from this place. The food is terrible and the service sucks. I can not believe this place is still open. I went there at 4:00 and no one was there. Do not order from here! Email me I I will tell you more"}
{"text":"Worst pepperoni pizza I've had in years. I got the $11.49 Large 16\" one topping special (coupon offer in menu). The cheese is terrible- bland and squishy. The pepperoni is generic and not very spicy and the crust is boring as well. The staff were friendly and service was reasonably quick, but I'll definitely not be getting pizza from here again."}
