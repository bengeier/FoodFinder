{"text":"Adam, our server was absolutely fantastic. He was attentive to our dietary needs, and had an outstanding attitude. Thank you, Adam! You're amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for quick dinner at the bar (burger arrived within 10-15 minutes which was great). I wanted to change up the cheese with Manchego instead of American, so I chose the Zinburger with Manchego Cheese & Zinfandel Braised Onions (w/light mayo).  Overall a great burger, I just thought the onions overpowered the cheese. Great staff, very friendly,  and I will certainly come back and try out the Samburger (which I was told is one of the more popular burgers)."}
{"text":"Zinburger never disappoints. Delicious burgers. I usually get the zinburger. All of the salads are good as well. Definitely try the banana royal milkshake."}
{"text":"The burgers are always delicious. Meat is cooked to perfection, thick burgers and grass fed! The fries are good... Milkshakes are great, def one of the best milkshakes I ever tried was their salted Carmel one... Only down fall was getting there 12 min early... It was cold out and just us two... We asked if we could eat real quick outside and be out before they closed.. (We eat real fast we were sharing a burger and fries..) the bar tender with hardly any personality or manners or maybe just was having a bad day wasn't helpful when I asked if he knew of a spot outside to sit... At the places I worked at... We don't consider it closed till the exact time.. Everyone has diff policies though but it just is bad for their business.. I see it as You should let everyone in till closing time comes then close the place!! The employees don't start actually \"cleaning & closing\" till everyone out that's at least what the places did I worked at as a kid.."}
{"text":"Order Ahi Tuna burger, cooked to perfection, switch coleslaw instead of fry, no problem w// staff, everything was excellent, service was great, had fry during last visit those were excellent as well"}
{"text":"Two words: Butterfinger Shake.  Two more words: Life Changing.  Loved the large selection, and the location is great and centrally located!  Service was good, it was lunchtime when my friend and I were there and the place was packed, but it was definitely not reflected in our service!  Of  course I had to try the house burger (purely for research, haha), so I ordered the Zin Burger and it was great.  I don't know if I would go so far as to say it tops the Deluxe Burger from Deluxe, but definitely comparable.  Oh and did I mention the butterfinger shake :)?"}
{"text":"Great food and very family friendly.   The service was exceptional. Eric was the best!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place 8 times, with work meetings and loved it every time. They have great food and very nice servers. They have the best milk shakes and a comfortable eating area."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectation was set too high but I thought it was just ok.  The atmosphere was creative and fun but the food was nothing special.  I ordered the Turkey Burger and thought it had way too many spices working and was loaded with mayo.  Even though I will try it again in the future I won't be in a huge hurry to get there."}
{"text":"My husband and I both got the Kobe burger and it was fantastic!  Also the Nutella hazelnut milkshake was amazing!!!!!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Zinburger a few times a year for 5 years since I first fell in love with the Kobe burger.  Not sure when they switched up the menu to feature the grass-fed beef instead of Kobe, but as a Kobe-fan I wish they would go back.  For me, the Kobe is what set Zinburger apart of other more upscale burger eateries for me.  The Strauss grass-fed beef was okay per my palate (medium rare cooked), but lacking that melt-in-your-mouth, free-of-gristle Kobe experience I consistently got every time I ate there.  

Aside from that, Truffle Fries are a must, service has always been excellent for me.  Not sure I'll make the out-of-the-way trip on my own volition in the future, however."}
{"text":"A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike), but he was wonderful!"}
{"text":"We love the Zinburger at the Biltmore location so our experience at this location was so disappointing!  We arrived at 9:15 pm on a Friday night and there were very few people inside the restaurant besides ourselves.  Still it took 45 minutes to get our meal!  Our zucchini fries were limp and cold (we returned them) and my burger was so cold, the cheese had congealed.  Ick.  The staff was totally consumed by cleaning and talking the entire time we were there.  Our waiter disappeared for 20 min and I had to ask another one for more ketchup.  Which never came.  My husbands salad was great but, hey, we went there for the burger!  We won't go back.  Go to the Biltmore location and get great food AND service!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. And I don't dislike it. It's just that if you're a vegetarian and want dinner here, you're probably going to order the veggie burger, and if you have any taste buds, you're probably going to be disappointed. It's a black bean burger but really mushy and not well seasoned. The truffle fries were fabulous though. Zucchini was ok. Desserts look great but I don't have any room left."}
{"text":"Definitely a great burger place!  The food and atmosphere were great!  The service was attentive and friendly.  Great spot for kids or no kids!  Great location in the Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"We gave Zinburger in Gilbert another try on Saturday and were VERY happy with our meal and experience....the key is to CALL AHEAD!  We were seated as soon as we arrived.  And, someone was at the door to greet us and check on our table as soon as we entered.  We sat inside, so not sure how comfortable it is to sit outside...maybe next time.  My daughter tried the kid's chicken strips and liked them.  I finished her last few bites and thought they were very good.  The rest of us tried burgers, which were all big and very tasty....and cooked to perfection.  We all loved the fries and thought the onion rings were good as well.  My wife and son had a strawberry shake for dessert and liked it enough to get one again.  Probably the biggest surprise after reading some other reviews was the service....which was spot on!  Our server (Eyan) took very good care of us and did a great job.  Fast to take our order, kept our drinks re-filled and came around just enough not to be too bothersome but to be there when we needed something.

Now that we know the trick (to call ahead), we'll definitely be back after having a really good meal.  For the size and quality of the food, I think the value is right in line with other restaurants.  It's not a fast food burger, so don't expect to pay fast food prices...cost is right in line with the quality.  Much better experience than the first time.  Looks like the management is on top of things and is making necessary changes to improve where people found them lacking.  We had no complaints whatsoever and will definitely return."}
{"text":"The place was super packed inside (and uncomfortably hot considering it's not summer time) so we opted to dine outside. We asked the hostess to turn on one of the heat lamps, she looked at it and said she didn't feel any heat from it so we asked again to please turn it on again thinking maybe she misunderstood us. She fiddled with the knob and then left. She never actually turned it on. Our server took our order promptly and brought us our drinks quickly. The loaded fries were less than impressive. It was like fries sitting on melted velveeta cheese with sour cream drizzled on top. Not worth their price in my opinion. Our burgers tasted great. Can't complain about that at all! However 3 pickle chips as a side is a little weird considering the high price of the burger. I'd expect fries or a salad to be included with the price of the burger. All in all, 4 stars for the taste of the burger and for our server who was friendly and quick but this isn't a place we'll be frequenting because it's too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but good burgers! Its unfortunate you have to pay extra for french fries.... Honestly, Red Robin has just as good burgers for cheaper... Location location location people...."}
{"text":"Quick and attentive service, the waitress checked on us regularly. The food was above average. I ordered the namesake and my husband ordered the samburger. The flavor of the patty was delicious and was cooked well. 

My husband had one small complaint that his burger was a tad greasy, but he still downed it like it was no problem. I have eaten at a lot of upscale burger places ( Burger Bar & BUGR, both in Vegas) and this one is on pair with them. What set them apart for me was the perfectly delectable Double Truffle Fries. They had the perfect amount of truffle oil and were cut medium thick the way I prefer fries! 

I want to come back if anything for those delicious fries and maybe to try one of their many shakes or homemade banana cream pie ( yes, it sounds amazing)."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the biggest rip off in town.  Small patties not even cooked to order since they're so thin. Nothing buns. Big, big prices. To make matters worse it's louder than loud. Probably all the 4-6 year olds coming from the children's pottery store next door. 

Nice waitresses though. But man are these price tags a joke. Plus, fries or onion rings are $5-7 extra.  Why?  I guess it's because they can.   But not to me. At least not again."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers ever!! If we ever recommend a place to eat for people looking, Zinburger is always the top of the list!"}
{"text":"Always loved Zinburger however, just recently went and the food didn't taste the same. Service was great as usual but our burgers were dry and tasteless. I always get the Zinburger and was disappointed."}
{"text":"Favorite burger place! Very clean food and restaurant. 
Everyone who works here is very kind and always greets you with a smile. 
Ordered the Bruce lee burger and it was fantastic, the Korean BBQ sauce provided a nice zip which went great with the avocado. 
The double truffle fries are amazing. Almost addictive."}
{"text":"Stopped by over the weekend because the place had good reviews.... the way they take your name and then text you and promote an app was stupid. It was all down hill after our server didn't know if she was our server or not..... she took our order and then someone else brought our food out, which is understandable. I realize they help each other out.... she came by once to see if we needed anything after we got our food. The table next to us had their server stop by more than 6 times at their table.... it looked like our server was busy working in the kitchen..... the food was nothing special, it was decent but not great. $40 bucks for 2 burgers and fries is not worth it when you add crappy service...."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love Zinburger! We like going in for brunch on the weekends and we always ask for the same server, Lexi, because she is so bubbly and on top of everything. She always brings drink refills and even offers to go cups. Our favorite thing to order is the loaded fries as an appetizer, and then I get a breakfast burrito or veggie scramble and my husband gets a burger. Then we share! It's the perfect amount and everything is always so good!! Strongly recommend going to Zinburger and you NEED to order the loaded fries."}
{"text":"Food just O.K. nothing special...had the Kobe burger, tasted good but not worth $15.00...personally Whole Foods has way better burgers, I always get Bison, it's delicious and juicy...nice atmosphere,  waiter was nice , but trying to hard , but better than being ignored haha. Won't be going to any Zin Burger places. .once was enough.."}
{"text":"Friendly service, nice variety of specials, clean and we only waited 2 minutes.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Trendy and sociable atmosphere... Food was delicious. We shared a bleu burger with sweet potato fries and a chopped salad to start. The waitress was very attentive and efficient. Burger was nicely split for us on two plates and salad plates were chilled. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Food was cold. Atmosphere was great! Very expensive. Wanted to try desert severe was hard to find."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant recently, with friends, while I was on vacation. The decor was a little overwhelming. Very cold and sterile. When I saw the menu, I was shocked at the prices, but figured, Oh well, I am on vacation. when my burger arrived, it was overcooked and had the wrong condiments. I ordered mayo and it was left off, I ordered deli mustard and received plain yellow mustard, instead. The burger was replaced, but by the time I received the replacement, my friends were done eating and had to wait for me."}
{"text":"Pros:
Burgers were thick, fresh, and flavorful.
Fries were tasty.

Cons:
Kobe burger costs $14.
The portion of fries for $5 was extremely small.
We had about 4 different \"servers\" who didn't seem to know what was going on, unlike at Houston's where multiple servers are seamless.
Fries took about 25 minutes to come out, and burgers another 25-30 minutes after that. We were starving by then. It was a Thursday night, and the place was busy, but not packed."}
{"text":"I think I'm kind of torn on this place. Strictly for the food, it's a good burger. I had the samburger (I think that's what it was called) cheese, bacon, lettuce, and thousand island dressing. It was cooked medium, just like I requested, and it was a good sized meal (I only ate half, and was full). The bun was a tasty wheat bread, and the meat was of great quality, good texture, and great flavor. 

I also split an order of sweet potato fries, which were good, but nothing to write home about. I'd be interested to try the zucchini fries they have though. 

The beer selection here is good, some non standards on tap, such as Left Hand Polestar Pilsner (which was a bit disappointing compared to some of LH's other offerings, but that's nothing against the restaurant) and one of my favorites, Deschutes Black Butte Porter. Pricing on the drinks was as expected for the upscale area, at $5.50/pint. 

I do regret not trying the milkshakes, because they looked damn good, but quite frankly, I just can't eat that much. The menu is simple, but offers enough variety to keep in interesting. So far so good, right???? 

Well, here's where I become torn. The burgers are $10+, fries were extra at $6 (shared) and the beers were $5.50/pint. So, for two burgers, a split order of fries, two pints, tax, and tip, I spent over $60. Yes, it was good, but $60 for burgers and fries seems a bit steep, no matter how good. Not helping their cause, is Delux. If I remember correctly, the burgers at Delux were around $8, and were just as good, or maybe even better, fries were still shared, and their beer selection terrific! (selection is good, but it's all on tap, which scores big points in my book) 

In the end, the magic adjective is \"good.\"  Zinburger is good. The service was good, helpful, and nice, and the place had a good ambiance and vibe. If it were a little less expensive and/or Delux didn't exist, this would be my go to burger joint in the area."}
{"text":"First visit. I had the namesake Zinburger and my companion had the breakfast burger. We both agreed that these were among the most outstanding burgers we had ever had. They were complemented by the onion rings and sweet potato fries both of which we're very good."}
{"text":"Good food, clean place, and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would give the Tucson Zinburger 5 stars without a second thought.  They are fabulous and it pains me to say bad things about their sister restaurant in beautiful phoenix.  Maybe I would be happier with Biltmore Zinburger if Tucson Zinburger didn't set such high standards to live up to.

I have been here 3 times and my burger has been over cooked every time.  Medium is supposed to be pink all the way through not a faint line of pink in the middle of a brown burger.  I sent it back the first time and it was a huge ordeal so I just delt with it the next two times Ugh.  The Banana Cream Pie at the Tucson location is out of this world.  Unfortunately, I haven't had the pleasure of eating it in Phoenix because they have been out every time!  Tucson also has these great burger of the day specials but I guess the Phoenix location doesn't do them - they should start!

I was also surprised to find that the Phoenix Zinburger was not very amenable to substitutions.  They wouldn't add strawberries to one of my milk shakes.  Why I do not know.  They wouldn't do a half order of French fries (something I always appreciate in Tucson) and they wouldn't do  1/2 sweet potato fries and  1/2 regular - Zinburger you should do that Delux does!

Will I go back?  Probably because I keep hoping that I will love this one like I love the other one but I will definitely TRY to get my Zinburger fix in when in Tucson."}
{"text":"Everyone really liked their food, we had burgers with fries for the kids, chicken sandwich and a salad for the adults. The kids menu is great, $3 burger and fries, $2 shakes! There was a long line but we opted to sit outside and were seated right away. Service was solid and the place has a nice festive atmosphere. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow....terrible. Where do i start? First, how about a waiting area where you look into the restrooms whenever someone enters or exits...appetizing. Burger was cold and soggy. Asked for sliced onion and tomato and got two slivers you could see thru. Zucchini was so greasy and limp...didnt eat that either. Did i mention it took almost 20 mins to get drinks? Left hungry and disgusted. Very expensive waste of time. Unfortunately, nothing less than one star. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Table Wait times. I wasn't in a rush so it wasn't a big deal - it was a nice evening to have a beer, but yes, I can see why people complain about the wait. We were told 1 hour, but it ended up being less than that, maybe 45 mins. It helped that we got a seat at the bar. And yes, there were empty tables with about 30 people standing waiting. WTF. When we paid our bill it was 7.42pm, and it was getting less busy.

Food wait time. 20-30 mins. Again, not a problem if you're not in a hurry, but it's burger and fries. I can get an almost as good meal at In'N'Out in 5-10 mins.

Food. I enjoyed my burger. I got the El Diablo, Medium rare like I asked for. Good thick slice of cheese, plenty of jalapenos, nice dressing. Fries; we had 1 x regular fries, and it was enough for 3 people. The other 2 meals were enjoyed also. The banana royale was very good.

Service. Our server was Lindsey; nice, friendly, attentive. No complaints.

Price; $60 with tax not tip, for 3 burgers, 1 fries, 1 beer, 2 sodas, 1 shake. I would say fairly good value.

Overall; I read some reviews before going, so I was a little apprehensive. But ultimately we all had a nice experience, better than I expected from the reviews.
However, wait times need to be improved before I make this a regular place. I would say go after 8pm, but I personally don't like eating that late.

Delux burger is a nicer experience in this price bracket."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The food was great both times. First time I had the Samburger and the second time I had the Breakfast burger with no bun, which came on a bed of lettuce. Both cooked exactly to order. The green chili fries are amazing!!!! So delicious!
However, the service wasn't that great the second time. I sat at the bar because there was a 20 min wait to sit at a table, and it ended up taking 20min for the server to come over and take our drink order. So if you go, don't sit at the bar. You get much better service if you wait and sit at a table."}
{"text":"Have tried this place 4 different times ( only cause we had received gift cards) and were very disappointed every time. First off- EVERY time we have gone either we have found a hair in the food or someone right next to us have. I'm sorry but after the 4th time going and seeing a hair in your food or your neighbors... Is ridiculous. And gross. 
There burgers buns are not moist and not Toasted. And the price of the food is wayyyy over priced. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I sat on the patio here twice for lunch in the past 2 weeks and was sad that it took me so long to try this place. I had the Zinburger with a few changes...bacon,  chipotle mayo, caramelized onions, Bleu cheese and ketchup.  They are a little pricey but worth it. The truffle fries are good and so were the couple of reds that I tried. One was a syrah and k forget the other. I will be back again but for 5 stars they could give a 1/2 order of fries for $2 instead of being straight ala carte."}
{"text":"WTF, the cows on the mural inside the restaurant have no udders!? The hostess explained to me that udders were determined to be inappropriate for children...wow SF You've got it goin'.

BTW, the food was good!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Do yourself a favor and try out the black and blue Burger."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that does not serve extras with their burger, that is to say that fries do not come with your burger, you would think that they would make it up in service and presentation, but no they don't. The service is marginal. They have young, inexperienced waiters and waitresses who do not know the menu and are unable to make recommendations. Their presentation is weak. I've been there twice - once for a burger the other for a salad. The burger was nothing special and the chopped ahi, avocado, and cashew salad was oily, had 1 slice of avocado, and literally 3 cashews hidden in the salad. They are only receiving 1 star because the beer was very cold and well poured. 

If you want a burger which should ALWAYS include fries, go somewhere else. Fries are extra and they try to make them special but without success. If you want a cold beer while your significant other is shopping at the Biltmore, stop in and take a load off. If you want a meal, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Zin Burger is a good spot for lunch, assuming you don't mind dining in an outdoor mall.

Food was pretty good, with burgers and fries being the main point of focus of course.   Burgers aren't anything to write home about, but get the job done.  Fish sandwich and veggie burger were okay -- kind of what you'd expect to get at a chain restaurant.  The truffle fries were over truffled to the point of being kind of gross.  A decent beer selection was a plus. 

The black eye for the place was the service.  Our waitress (who must have barely been 18) promoted savignon blanc from Spain (maybe that exists somewhere, but not on their wine list) and food was coming out undercooked (meaning raw chicken) to tables around us.  Multiple members of the staff told us our food was on its way out, which it wasn't (we were a four top at lunch on a sat -- weird)."}
{"text":"Me and my friends are from the midwest and the Midwest has good burgers. OMG Zinburger has the best burger ever. The patty is cooked perfectly and juicy. We had the zin burger and it blew our minds away. The service is also excellent. We didn't like the chocolate shake we ordered and it was replaced at no cost for a chocolate vanilla shake that was incredible. Love the burger. Love the shake. Love the service. Please open up in California."}
{"text":"Great burger and atmosphere. If you like the Biltmore area you won't be disappointed by Zinburger. 

I always get the sweet potato fries to make me feel better about my choice and the burgers are filling and great."}
{"text":"With the day off and being in the area, we thought it would be a great opportunity to try Zinburger. Besides, out of town coworkers liked the burgers so much they ate there two nights in a row. Also, most of the Fox Restaurants are usually decent and with their 25% off Labor Day enticement, why not? However, it was a huge disappointment! 

We passed True Food on our way to the entrance, which was not busy while Zinburger was bustling. Busy seemed like a good, initial sign. The wait was 20 minutes for a table inside, so we opted to sit outside immediately thinking the misters would help with the heat and that we could avoid the wait, order and eat fast. That was not the way it turned out. 

We were seated in the side patio, in direct sunlight and the misters sprayed in the opposite direction. If there was water, that would've helped but it didn't come until 20 minutes after we ordered. By that time, we were ready to pass out. The sweet potato and zucchini fries that arrived 15 minutes later, were not bad. Then, 10 minutes later, the burgers arrived. 

My order was for a Zinburger cooked to medium.  Once it was cut into half, the meat was red and raw in the middle.  Medium to me is pink, not RED.  Immediately, the bun and condiments got soggy from the greasy, oily juice and fat oozing from the meat patty.  My fingers and nails became soiled from the fluid.  I could not eat the other half since the meat was raw and everything else was soaked in the greasy oil, leaving the most undesirable appearance and texture.  Also, the waiter was so scarce and service so slow, that sending it back was not an option.  

This ranks among one of least pleasing burgers ever, and certainly pales in comparison to other burgers eaten in the same price range.  Given that both the food and service experience was so dreadful, we will never dine here again."}
{"text":"The hubs and I tried this place after a long day of shopping (more so long for him than myself.)

We arrived around 7:30 or so on a Saturday night, and had about a 30 minute wait for a table. We grabbed a stool at the bar and had a drink while we waited. The staff was friendly and the overall vibe of the place was laid back.

We got to our table and the server was over quickly to say hi while we looked at the menu.

I ordered a basic burger while the hubs ordered a mediterranean style burger.

The burgers were incredible! I love a good burger, but rarely am I ever swooning over one. Oh it was delicious. 

We were too full for dessert or milkshakes, so that is on the to-do list next visit."}
{"text":"My one star is for the turkey burger alone.  I wouldn't go back to dine here again, but I would order it to go, it was very good...but a little over priced.  Burger places shouldn't be pretentious in my opinion, and this place oozes that."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but after my experience here i felt compelled to do so. We had received a fox concepts gift card from friends; and at their advice, decided to try this zinburger. After my expeirence here I am wishing we would have regifted this gift, or drove to Scottsdale to use it at one of fox's better restaurants, blanco taco + tequila. Instead we attempted gilbert's zinburger which afforded the worst service I have ever received. The wait to get in was long and those who arrived after us were seated and served before us. Not to mention our horrible waitress who seemed to forget the tenents of good service... at times we had had to stop eating for several minutes just to flag down the wait staff for a refill on a wine glass that sat empty for  several minutes while the wait staff passed us by with total disregard. Mind you, the restaurant was fairly quiet at this time as many patrons had already exited the restaurant. While the food was average; the prices, horrible service, and unremarkable ambience makes this a place to skip if looking for a good burger in thw valley."}
{"text":"Seriously, anyone who can give this place less than 5 stars you're either 1.) Only rating the \"ambiance\" not the food 2.) Don't appreciate a great quality burger or 3.) Ordering a damn salad and complaining about it not being top notch at a place that specializes in burgers. This place is hands down mouthwatering! I've alternated between both their regular beef patties and the Kobe beef. There isn't a huge difference but the Kobe beef is definitely juicier! What's great is that their toppings are always fresh. So you'll never get a soggy burger. But it might get messy. That's usually how you know you're eating a great burger though! And their fries? Excellent! You cannot go wrong with getting the double truffle fries or even better? Their loaded fries! These fries are smothered with hot melted white cheddar cheese, sour cream that's lightly drizzled on top, small bits of diced scallions, and topped off with bacon! And I can't leave out the customer service. My boyfriend and I have actually become regulars here and it's always a nice touch when they warmly greet is back and remember us. Staff here is definitely friendly! If this review isn't enough to make you stop by and try this place out, then you'll definitely be missing out!"}
{"text":"Bananas foster shake -- amazing!
Truffle fries -- very good! But they really should allow diners to do \"half and half\" fries to try different kinds or they should make half-size orders...the server said they were \"working on it,\" whatever that means.
Zinburger -- meh. I definitely enjoy the burgers at Delux more, and for $10, you should get a superb burger. The beef was good quality but not incredibly flavorful, and the burger overall was bland. Also, the bun was a little too soft to support the burger patty and toppings.

Service was good - although the hostess underestimated our wait time quite a bit, she apologized, and then our server was great. The atmosphere is just okay - plain and modern, almost corporate feeling... a bit like Sauce, another Fox place. The bar area is nice, though.

If I was in the Biltmore area and craving a burger, I'd stop at Zinburger, but I wouldn't make any special trips there."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for lunch and it was our first time.  I was surprised to see such a long wait for lunch so we decided to sit at the bar to avoid the 30 min wait.  The bartender was nice and helpful and you could tell she was busy being the only one behind the bar.  We ordered the Diablo and the Breakfast burger.  Also, we ordered fries and sweet potatoes fries.  We asked for the burger and fries to be brought out together but instead they came out separately.  As an aside, I didn't like that burgers don't come with fries and that you had to order separately.  The burgers came out about 10 min after the fries and the burgers were luke warm similar to comments that have been posted.  However, the taste was fantastic! I had the gluten free bun and it was nice and light.  I tried some of my wife's Diablo and it had a nice smokey heat flavor that was perfect. 

We also got a Nutella milk shake and asked for it to go.  It came out and was in a glass.  I love Nutella and this was an amazing shake just a little thick and you could not drink it through a straw.  So all in all a good experience but seems like there is some communication gaps between what is told to the kitchen staff and what is actually delivered.  Also, I hoping for a warmer hamburger next time. I have high standards for a 50 dollar lunch."}
{"text":"Will not be going to this establishment again. The first time wasn't all that great to begin with, but thought I'd give it another try. First off the wine list is extremely weak, I was expecting more selection and better. 

This time around, I was told the kitchen was backed up so they weren't seating people, yet there were tables open AND I could've ordered some drinks while waiting, that's where the margins are. Not sure why a restaurant with open tables would leave them empty due to the kitchen being backed up. The bar isn't AND maybe even appetizers would come out faster. That was there second try and they blew it. DONE!!

Postinos here I come!!! Much better anyway!!"}
{"text":"FailBurger

As i said in my review of Delux... I'm still looking for a great burger place in central phx.  This place let me down.  

Not that the food was terrible, but it was just mediocre.  First of all, I had to wait for a table... Usually a good sign!  

The waitress was about 16, she knew nothing about wine and was totally incabable of answering questions.  The waitstaff bus their own tables, so it takes longer to turn them.  Then a 17 year old server was arguing with the 16 year old hostess about seating his section.  Terrible.

People... sweet potato fries taste pretty much the same everywhere, lets calm down... mmmkay?  Thanks.  This place blows a hole.  Fox Restaurant Concepts is hit or miss.  Bloom is a miss, True Food is a Hit, ZinBurger is a miss, Sauce is a hit.  etc etc etc.  

If you want a good burger and an overpriced bottle of wine that the server knows nothing about... i suggest going to 5Guys Burgers, grab one to go... and get a bottle of wine from the grocery store... just pick one with the coolest label.  Same result."}
{"text":"Craving burgers!  Arrived right before the rush on Friday lunch.  Two reg & one vegan burger & the truffle fries.  Burgers ordered pink please.  Both burgers sent back as it was so raw as inedible.  The vegan was cold.  The returns were no better.   The service slowed down to nothing.  Very disappointed.  Won't return."}
{"text":"This place hands down has the best veggie burger in Scottsdale, it is nice to see a restaurant put effort into a vegetarian option rather than just throwing something together so they can say they have one. Other people in my party had various burgers and everyone was really pleased with the food. The parmesan truffle fries are also a must have! The location is great and the staff is friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love almost everything about this restaurant. 
1. The decor is perfect: the barn feel, the milk carafes as lights at the entrance and exit and butcher block tables. Every detail was tied in. At first I thought it was strange that the restroom entrance was outside, but it worked.
2. The food was exceptionally good.
3. Service was also exceptionally good.
The only thing that bothered me was that the wait times were really long. I get it, good restaurant, long wait times, but there were handful of tables open and cleaned, so I couldn't rationalize it. There must be a reasonable answer, but either way they are doing so much right that this place deserves to have 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and I have always enjoyed the food! Both the burgers and the fries are great, and the price isn't too bad either. The service was also pretty good, and each of our servers were very attentive.

The only drawback is that the food is a bit heavy. Overall though, I would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"The Good:

Great Service!! Not to annoying, but always there when you need them! BURGER WAS FANTASTIC!!!!! Fries pretty good,

The bad! Considering what I have come to expect from Fox the salad was TERRIBLE! It seriously was disgusting lettuce with a few tomatos and bacon bits. It was the Large size of the two offered and it was smaller than any other half salad anywhere, Also, we order a burger and fries. It was a little pricey. They do everything al a carte, but come on this is Not Ruth Chris. So if you want a burger fries and soda it is $20 before tip. A little pricey! The burgers aren't big enough to charge that much. HOWEVER, the ingredients they put on them are AWESOME!! I would go back for sure"}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times now and I am just not impressed enough to go back again.  I have tried a few of the burgers and one of the salads and it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't memorable either."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! Great cocktails! Delicious milkshakes! The service is always quick and friendly. Sometimes the wait is a little long but the food is definitely worth the wait! My only tip would be they could add more tables to accommodate the crowd. But overall I recommend anyone that hasn't been should give it a try!"}
{"text":"Zinburger = HANGOVER CURE!

Aside from that, the burgers are deeeeelicious and the ambiance is great as well. But let me start from the beginning..

I wake up to a pounding headache and not feeling too hot as a whole..you know, when the thought of eating breakfast (eggs especially) makes you want to lose it. So, when my friend invited me to venture to Zinburger, I was excited. Not about moving...but about burgers. 

While en route to the restaurant, my friend calls and tells me that they have a Bacon infused vodka bloody mary and if she wanted me to order one. Ummm...YES???? Liquid bacon plus vodka in the form of a bloody mary? Mommy daddy...yay!!!!!! 

I arrive to this delicious beverage screaming my name, a sunny spot on the patio and just a prefect/fun atmosphere. The bloody mary alone was to die for. I had to refrain from eating the glass...

On to the food..burgers...and lots of them. Not to forget the sweet potato fries and other yummies. The burgers were great. Maybe only us people, who are completely obsessed with burgers, can truly appreciate a good burger. Others should opt for McDonalds. I don't care what you say..you can taste the difference: the meat, the cheeses, the buns, the lettuce...everything. 

Why the four stars? Because Delux still has the crown..."}
{"text":"Meat is fresh but fries are just average at best. Had to ask too many times for condiments. Go to 5 guys if u just want a burger."}
{"text":"LOOOOONG wait time to get seated, but excellent food. The service was also excellent with the waitress checking back frequently to make sure we had everything we wanted and to ask if the food tasted alright."}
{"text":"Went with my husband on the first day it was officially opened.  Shared a burger, basket of onion rings, and we each had a nice glass of wine.  It was happy hour so our bill totaled 20.00 and we loved everything.  Nice service (attentive but not hovering), perfectly juicy and flavorful burger (seriously tasty bun), and generous serving of nicely crunchy onion rings.  We are fortunate to live in Gilbert and I'm sure we will be enjoying many more delicious meals out on their beautiful patio."}
{"text":"Upon entering, one of the waitresses talked me into their burger of the week, The Jalapeno Popper Burger. I was excited to try this with high expectations after trying a similar burger at The Saddle Ranch (now closed). 

The burger it's self was better than what I've tasted before but didn't meet my complete expectations. For starters, there was barely any jalapenoes on it. I counted four slices, very lightly breaded. When i tasted them, they were duds, no spice to it at all. The cream cheese that was on it was a bit too overkill, taking over the flavor of the entire burger, over powering the flavor of the chipotle mayo. 

The good part about it is the general foundation of the burger. The meat was tasty, well seasoned, and cooked to my liking (ordered medium well). The bun was nice and fluffy, and complimented the burger well along with the common toppings (lettuce, etc.)

Overall, they have a good start but needs a bit of work."}
{"text":"Overpriced for a mediocre hamburger at best!  Nothing to be impressed with.  You don't even get fries with it!  Do yourself a favor and go to Red Robin for a way better burger at a lower price which also includes bottomless steak fries!"}
{"text":"I was not really fond of this place.  It had a good vibe and I had really good service.  

The food was not the best thing I had ever tasted and the place was very loud.

I will tell you that the Ahi Tuna burger I got was really good but the sweet potato fries were ok.

I live kind of far for this place and I would rather go to delux for a burger or in and out or chuck box or smashburger.

Good for groups of 2-6

Recommendation: If your close by and need a good lunch stop in but not worth any trek out."}
{"text":"This place was great! Staff was friendly without being too overbearing! 

I had a group of 25 people, I did make a reservation about a week or so in advance. With no trouble whatsoever. We arrived about 15 min early than our scheduled reservation (which was for 6:30pm) and the restaurant accidentally double booked the reso. Which wasn't a big deal for us at all. We were a large group and it happens, but they did a GREAT job getting us sat and everyone had water by 6:31! They did a great job. I don't think I can stress that enough. The wait staff was friendly and promt without being overbearing. They joked around with us and made the experience that much more memorable. 

Barry, who I'm assuming was the manager was great as well! 

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. It was great. Not to mention the food, beer and shakes were delicious too!"}
{"text":"Had my husband pick up Zinburger for dinner and I wound up getting food poisoning :( We had a very positive dining experience the first time we went, was just disappointed that the second time made me so sick! Unfortunately won't be trying again."}
{"text":"Been here twice... First visit was really good.  One of the best burgers I've ever had.  KOBE was to die for.  The second time around I ordered the same thing and I'm pretty sure they didn't give me KOBE.  2 stars at best. I will be coming back once more in the event it was just an off night."}
{"text":"The burgers are juicy, not greasy. The Nutella hazelnut milkshake is so delicious, three of us shared one and they split it in separate cups for us, a deal for $5."}
{"text":"I will first start by saying that Zinburger's food is great. This was my 3rd visit to the restaurant and the food has always been served hot and delicious. However, their staff this visit took away from the positives of the food. Our party of five went last night for dinner. There was a good size crowd but not crazy busy. We had a party of 5 and opted to take first available seating. We were sat outside and sitting outside isn't too bad because they have heaters by the tables. The first half of our service wasn't bad. The food came out timely and was perfect. The waitress made sure that we had everything needed. However, the heater went out midway through our meal. We let our waitress know and she said she would take care of it. 10 minutes later still no heater and we are getting colder. I waitress comes out and ask if we want any dessert. We ask for a piece of pie and for the heater to be turned on, again. 15 minutes more pass and we still have no heater, no pie and it feels like our waitress is ignoring us. So my sister goes inside to a group of employees standing around and ask for a manager. My sister is usually pretty good about these things because she herself is a restaurant manager and knows that situations with an upset costumer can be unpleasant. However, this manager apparently had no sense of urgency. When he came out he didn't introduce himself and was only slightly apologetic. I explained at this point that we did not want the pie and just would like the check since we were so cold. Of course at this time the pie is just arriving and he ask the server to box it up. He then lets us know that he is not going to charge us for the pie. He then brings the check immediately and waits to take our cards. He then goes inside to run the cards. On his way in he says something to our waitress and she proceeds to roll her eyes with annoyance. Granted I am only assuming it was about us but given the circumstances. At that point I just wanted to get out of there and get some where warm. It really bums me out that this experience has put me off the restaurant because I really do like their food.  Oh well, the great thing about downtown Gilbert is there are a lot of other really good options to choose from."}
{"text":"Zinburger was recommended by a family member and we decided to take a chance on it. The area around the restaurant is very busy and has numerous stores to shop in. Taking a trip around the shopping area before eating, we walked in the restaurant and what a beautiful, peaceful color of lime green. Outdoor seating with huge umbrellas and who would not want to sit out and see the area you are in, we did just that. The burger that I had was a very good burger along with the fries. A custom burger at a moderate price, this place is here to stay. Check out the cows on the walls. Friendly staff, great service. would go back again when visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I had the Breakfast Burger, I ordered it Medium, and according to the server, that meant \"warm pink\" all the way throughout the burger. I got the burger and it was juicy, but it was not pink all the way through, looked more medium well. Don't get me wrong, it was still a very good burger.

I do have one suggestion. I am single, and I usually am by myself, so I never can get a side. The reason is the sides are a la carte and they are sized for two people. I think they should add half size sides for the people who do not have a second person with them."}
{"text":"I am all about the truffle fries! All of the burgers I have tried are always great as well. I had the Diablo Burger last night, and it is probably my favorite! The environment here is nice too, very family friendly. When the weather is nice they open up the building which is beautiful during autumn and winter!"}
{"text":"Awful! Burger was not cooked properly, they forgot the sautéed onions on the burger, and the onion rings were waaay too salty. We sent them all back. For the money, you can get much better food right next door."}
{"text":"Went to zin burger for Valentine's day. My wife and I had samoburger. Can't remember when last time had delicious burger right up there with Hodahs in Ocean Beach California. One of best burgers I've ever had. Also had loaded fries Wichita was great. Place was pack Saturday night, luckily we called 45 minutes before we arrived got our table in 5 minutes when we arrived. Had excellent waitress Elizabeth. Highly recommend this place for great burger."}
{"text":"I love zin burger at Biltmore. This one isn't as good. Food was good. Server was okay. But there was a 30 minute wait with lots of open tables?!? Quite a few employees standing around. And dirty bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other night with my girl friend. The burgers were very good as well as the green chilli fries. The service was good and fast the food came out fast.  The only issue I had was my long island ice tea just did not seem to have any alcohol in it. Other than that it was a good time."}
{"text":"our  server, kira, was  awesome!  great  vibe,  awesome &  creative  foods  and  great  wines! definitely  coming  back!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the expense.  Might as well go to smashburger. Small burgers. Okay taste. Soft buns though!

Forgot to add I ordered the Kobe beef burger. Stick to the regular burger. Nothing special about the Kobe for the $5 up-charge."}
{"text":"This place has a amazing turkey burger ! I'm hooked I wish I lived closer I would eat that turkey burger 3/4 times a week !"}
{"text":"Best turkey burger I've ever had I highly recommend everyone need to try this burger spot !"}
{"text":"I'd heard that the food here was good, if overpriced.  Finally gave it a go and I have to say that's exactly the impression I came away with.

I ordered the breakfast burger.  The service was a little on the slow side, we had to flag down the waitstaff once or twice to get their attention, but they were plenty friendly.  The burger itself was good, cooked just as I'd ordered it, and was pretty tasty too.  I was a little disappointed in the fried egg, it was a little overcooked and the yolk was completely solid, not what I expect from a burger with fried egg.

I decided to forgo the fries - $5 for a side of fries when I am already forking over $11 for a burger seems a little much.  Management sent us out a complimentary order of fries anyway due to the sluggishness of the service, and I wasn't impressed; they were limp and greasy.  As far as I could tell they just went across the street to McD's for the fries.  Most definitely not worth five bucks.

All in all I am not terribly impressed.  The food was good but not fantastic, the service was mediocre, and the prices were a bit much.  Sure, go and give it a try if you've never done it before, and if you're a fan of pretense you'll probably eat this place up.  If you're looking for a good burger, there's a lot of better choices.  As for me, I'm not likely to make a return visit."}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful & delicious!  I especially love the turkey burger with the poblano pepper.  My son is over the moon with the chocolate oreo shake.  Fries were a little cold & the wait was a bit long...but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Zinburger is AMAZING!!!!! :) We went there twice, and the kids cheeseburger was tasty. The fries were yummy and crispy. The Pico had delicious guacamole on it. The Bruce Lee was spicy and good. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Zinburger!!!!!! Make sure to get the zucchini fries!!! :D"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and shakes!  My family enjoys the great atmosphere. A little slow and usually packed! We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"2 years later we still go at least once a month. The burgers are soooooo delicious. Writing this review is making me crave one! Love the loaded fries and the shakes as well."}
{"text":"I do love to rip Sam Fox places, because I think his approach to restauranting is \"MAKE DA MONEY, WHO CARES BOUT DA FOOD!\"...usually. But I have to say, Zinburger at the Biltmore is deserving of its 4-star Yelp rating; which is to say it's a pretty solid place for a quick bite or maybe even a good meal. Been here a few times and the first visit was less-than-stellar, with an unprofessional waitress, cold fries and in-general blah feeling about my time and $40 for two lunch.

However, as of late, it seems the Zin is looking to Win. Had a very nice dinner with a friend here recently and the service was pretty good, the water-refill-girls were on-point, and the food was actually good.......and tasted fresh. Had a salad and I kid you not, the ingredients had the texture and taste of farmer's market quality.

Had their burgers in the past, and pretty decent. On-par with Delux down the street I would say. Fries...meh, not Zinburger's strong suit. But DAMN, hoss, it's an S Fox joint so you KNOW the wine/liquor list be KICKIN! Booze. It's how this chain makes its $$$.

If you've been to the Biltmore you know parking is a breeze. The grounds are clean, and the location is central. It's almost comical how bad restaurants can exist in such a class environment. But Blanco next store is gra-oss; and the \"Asian Fusion\" place that **used to be** in the Blanco space was hideous. Whatevs, anyway Ziburger is a solid corner lunch and dinner spot. Tables are adequately spaced apart and the noise level, while healthy, is not obnoxious...impressive considering there is a sizable bar in the center of the space.

Zinburger. Pretty OK. For a Fox spot, that's a victory."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE the spicy green chili fries.  Always very friendly and great atmosphere.  We have enjoyed pretty much everything we have ordered, but of course had to give those fries a special mention.  I haven't been to the other locations, but we enjoy downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"My husband and I liked the gourmet burgers + wine idea so much that we did this for our wedding at a modern art gallery.  Super fun and the guests loved it!  

Okay 1st things 1st.  They tend to undercook here...I like my burgers medium-rare, but medium-rare = rare in their book, so always order a little higher on the doneness scale to get what you want.  I always order a medium and get a PERFECT medium-rare.

The fries are incredible....it's a huge toss-up between the sweet potato and the truffle fries...they're both amazing and worth it!  All of the burgers are phenomenal and inventive...one time for the monthly special, there was a brie, basil, and balsamic burger....I'm not joking around when I tell you I was in heaven !!!!  My husband once had a Rueben - a kobe burger, piled high with pastrami, dijon, swiss, and on rye bread.  He still talks about that burger !!!  I love that they try new flavors and think out of the box.  

We go back every couple months or so - we are HUGE fans!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food! They use way better meat than the average restaurant."}
{"text":"We dined with our son who has many serious food allergies.  We called ahead to talk to a manager and ask if there will be any \"safe\" food options for him and to check if it is indeed safe from cross contamination.  The manager was Cole and told us our options, told us to have our server call him when we're seated,  and even took our name so that we can already be on the list as it was a 45 minute wait.  We got there a little bit early but was seated in a short time.  Cole came to our table and talked to us again about the options for my son.  We ordered him a plain burger patty and fries.  Cole said he'll make sure that the fries are fried in their gluten-free dedicated fryer and the burger cooked safely.  My son enjoyed his food! He loved the fries and the burger was juicy (not dry and overcooked like most places).  Cole even came back to our table to make everything was okay.  Thank you! For families like us that would love to eat at \"normal\" restaurants but worried to \"death\" if my son will be able to eat with us \"safely\"...we really appreciate this!"}
{"text":"I ate here last week and I really enjoyed the burger, fries and decor in this place. I've always thought there is only so much you can do to gussy up a burger and fries. The Zinburger and double truffle fries with aioli had some unique ingredients and tasted great (love the onions caramelized in Zinfandel.) The meat used in the burger is fresh and high quality and they cook it to your specification. Ya you're going to pay more but for $15-20 you're getting a much nicer product than the typical $10 bar burger with fries."}
{"text":"My best friend and I visited Zinburger on a week night and found it to be fairly busy.  Although we could have gotten a table (with no wait) we opted to sit at the bar facing into the restaurant.  Wonderful design element.  We had an excellent view of what was going on and both agreed that the layout and design was excellent.

The food was expensive but it was very good.  We split a kobe burger, double truffle fries, zucchini fries and a bottle of wine.  I was definitely just the right amount of full and left feeling wonderful (maybe that was due to the wine?).  

I'll be back to splurge.  This place was splendid."}
{"text":"Chose Zinburger to enjoy lunch with a friend on the patio & take in the cooler temps.  Man were we disappointed!! Let me start by saying the place wasn't even a little bit busy.  3 tables including ours in the patio.  Waited 10+ minutes before I went & tract down a waitress.  Decided better make the most of the visit we ordered drinks food all at once.  We ordered sweet potato fries.  When asked if we would like those to come out first we replied yes.  Drinks came relatively quickly &&& then the wait.  Finally all the food came at once.  ?? Whatever we were starving.  My burger was missing the bacon & had onions of which I request otherwise.  The boy that dropped off the food (still hadn't seen the waitress since drinks were dropped off) he left so quickly I caught him to ask for mustard & ranch.  No one came back until the original girl I flagged down came to check I mentioned the onions and the no bacon which I could have lived without but the onions were a deal breaker.  She offered to have it remade I was hesitant because I was so hungry but she assured me it would be quick.  My friend was almost done with her bun less double double that she requested with the trimmings and condiments that came with nothing.  She didn't mention it to the waitress because when she finally came back what was the point she was almost done.  The burger came back ... 10 min or so later by the manager who Said so sorry.  I again asked for mustard that had never come.   I dipped I to my BBQ sauce and found a hard thing like a twig... Happened to be a shaving off the toothpick that holds the buns together is what the waitress explained.   After I removed my burnt bun & pulled the twig out of my BBQ I continues to eat my dry burger when my mustard arrived half way through.... In the end  the waitress said we comp'd your burger just because we thought we'd be nice!   Really...really???  First & last visit!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Arizona two weeks ago and Zinburger was recommended by our hotel.  

I grew up on a ranch and have enjoyed beef all of my life.  I say this is the worst burger I have ever eaten.  I have never eaten a burger where I could not taste it.   iting into the burger I could not feel the beef.  I asked my wife, she had the same experience.  Neither of us had one of those burgers with tons of extra things so we should have been able to find and taste the meat.

We looked, found some, both were rare, I had ordered medium well.  I have had those experiences before and still felt the meat.

When questioning the waiter  he told us the meat is never frozen and ground fresh daily.  He seemed very proud of this, which he should be, but then added he had no idea how other burger places do it.  Ever heard of Culvers?

So, overpriced worst burger in my life, I'm over 60.  Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"First, let me say the food here is good. If you are looking for a bite and you happen to be in the area go check Zinburger out. 

Our waitress was enthusiastic (especially about the dessert we ordered) and she kept my water glass full, which I really appreciate - that's present tense on purpose. I drink a lot of water. 

However, the decor just doesn't fit... it's bright, and the booth we sat in was comfortable... somehow, though, there's a lack. It needs a touch more masculinity, a bit of grit, to really strike that burger joint chord.

I have to add that sitting at the bar instead of a booth improves the ambience. Also, the veggie burger, add avocado and pepperjack, sub ketchup and mustard for aoli, is something I crave on occasion.

And I love that they offer discounted to-go options during the movies in the grass. Spring and Fall the Biltmore shows movies out on the quad. If you haven't been, grab a blanket, call in your dinner order and get out to play!"}
{"text":"Best burger ever. A family favorite, so I have tried many of the different flavors but the classic Zinburger just cannot be beat. So good. Truffle fries are to die for as well as the banana royale shake! Great service and well designed outdoor space."}
{"text":"This was the place my husband and I chose for our post race meal after doing the Arizona Ironman 70.3. It was delicious! It absolutely satisfied and then some! The Breakfast burger was so good! Fresh avocado, a perfectly over-medium egg, and expertly fried bacon. And, when you ask for \"medium,\" they actually cook it medium. Plus, when our server, Ernesto saw our shirts, he asked about the race and gave us free desserts! What?! His service was great...even without the free dessert. Their beer list is pretty okay, wine list is impressive for a burger place, and the cocktail list was very tempting. We're just visiting from Sacramento and might not have the chance to come back, but I'm so glad we chose this place during our trip!"}
{"text":"I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT THE BEST HOSTESS AND WAITRESSES  IN PHOENIX! THEY ARE AT ZINBURGER!! 

Danielle (the Manager) and the Hostesses and waitresses are the best. In fact...the last time I was there (tonight) we walked in the door...were seated and 2 minutes later...Danielle brought me my usual: root beer float overflowing with extra chocolate ice cream!!! Before I could even ask for it!! I wish I had taken the name of the waitress because she was wonderful too!

PLUS ZINBURGER HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HAMBURGERS AND FRENCH FRIES OF ANYWHERE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO...albeit...I have cravings every once in a while for in n out burger...which I give in to a few times a month! Zinburger is right across the street from where I live: A DREAM COME TRUE!"}
{"text":"Although it is located in a shopping center, the burgers and fries are worth the visit.  The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating.  Good place to enjoy the cooler phx evenings while they last with a burger and specialty fries."}
{"text":"So Today I decided to create a yelp account for the first time due to my experience at Zinburger I felt it was necessary.

My wife and I left at about 3:45 and it was pretty busy in the restaurant. Our server was Lexi she was super nice, very on top of things, everything you could ask for when it comes to \"restaurant service\" I'm writing this review because the whole time we were sitting there we were watching the SAME 3 maybe 4 servers running around the restaurant, it was incredible. We looked around the entire restaurant and every table was sat inside. I'm not sure how many tables they each had but kudos to these servers because I know i could never do that. 

This was our second time in and the burgers were great! I created my own each time and it's definitely my favorite burger joint! Also need to have the spicy green chili fries!!

Again, thank you Lexi! You're the reason why I created a yelp."}
{"text":"My. Favorite. Burger.

Not to mention that the turkey and veggie burgers are great as well as the double truffle fries. 

It's one of the places I miss most not living in AZ."}
{"text":"First time in was a good experience. Place was very busy for a Sunday late morning. Very nice atmosphere, wide open, lots of light, comfy seating. My husband and I sat at the bar as it was available without a wait. Service good, no complaints there. Food was AWESOME. We totally enjoyed it. We shared the Zinburger (which we would not hesitate to order again) and the plain fries with a side of ranch. All fabulous! Been back and tried the Blue cheese/bacon burger... was just as great as the first time. We will be back as long as it stays this good."}
{"text":"First time there, and the staff and service were very friendly. Ordered the basic burger and it was juicy and flavorful. The burgers don't come with fries, you have to order them separately. Kinda like Delux. The fries were alright, kinda plain. I had to add salt and pepper to them because they were too bland. But the burger did justice, so I really didn't care. Got a milkshake at the end and I was not impressed. It wasn't creamy like I'm used too. Service was great though, burgers were delish. I will be back-but I must add-I used to be a vegetarian and that HUGE cow on the wall is pretty distracting, kinda made me not want to eat my burger........"}
{"text":"This place has turned out to be one of our favorite family restaurants.  I never thought a $15 Kobe burger would taste so sweet and juicy, not to mention the $15 fox block nine wine is the perfect compliment to my burger.

One time the hostess wasn't sure if she could get us a booth, as requested, but soon after we were able to sit down where we requested.  I have witnessed the manager (nick named by us the lady in the green dress) play cut the pickle with my 4 year old little boy.

I highly recommend this place for you and your family, out special day at Zinburger is every Sunday"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here.  It's casual and non-pretentious, kind of welcomed in the Scottsdale Quarter.  I tried their burger of the week, which was actually a chicken sandwich, but holy crap was it good.  Could get a little spendy here for what it is ($5 for fries, shakes a bit higher) but overall a really solid spot.  Quick service too."}
{"text":"I have been to different locations, and I'm a big fan in general. However, just walking in was some of the worst customer service I have ever encountered. Downtown Gilbert is especially busy on Sundays, but there were 4 ladies looking at the name chart, and I had been standing there with my family for 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged. No one was around. Fortunately, I was able to count all of the open (if dirty) tables and was happy to see we should be able to be seated shortly since 7 appeared to be available. When one girl finally acknowledged us, she took one look at the kids and told us it would be about 40 minutes. We asked if they took reservations, and she said no, just a 40 minute wait. I think it must have been because we had 4 kids with us and she didn't want to deal with it, but that will be my last visit to that location."}
{"text":"Do not order drinks, mine was full of syrup with no alcohol, waste of $. Saw very small wine portions being served. Burger good, cooked just the way I ordered. Skinny fries which I do not like, waste of $5. Milk shakes are a must. If you go, just order the burger and shake,  you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great burger but too much bun in my opinion. High quality meat. Great zucchini fries and shakes. The pie looked delicious but didn't try it. Good place to bring a date"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, prepared well, and came out quickly.  Initial service was a little slow, including how long it took to bring us our drinks after the order was placed.  Overall, it was delicious and once the food came the service improved!"}
{"text":"Last minute get together with some friends and it was my first visit. Seemed like a great place to eat and the pictures and descriptions were awesome. Good selection of unique beers too. Service sucked...waited almost 10 minutes for my beer that wasn't all that cold. My wife ordered the Sam burger and I got the boy blue. I was not impressed with this 10 dollar burger that tasted like straight blue cheese...with a hint of a1. No flavor in the meat and taste less. For my wife to tell me that a basic bacon cheeseburger with 1000 island was not tasty and rather have a burger from in n out was a shocker. The nutella shake was worth it but I don't think we will be going back for the food again."}
{"text":"Burger was tasty and service was friendly. Way over priced in my opinion.....it's just hamburger for gods-sake!  If you want your onions grilled that will be an extra $1.25 thank you very much. If you are rich or like to act like it, head on down to Zinburger and chow down. Bottom line.....Double cheeseburger with grilled onions and 2 beers, bam! $25.61 before tip."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Having never tried it before and not being a fan of \"trendy\" restaurants, I was reluctant to try it.  I'm glad we did.  We walked in to a nice and open environment greeted by not one but multiple smiles and staff ready to help us.  Once they asked where we would like to sit, our waiter showed up almost right away to great us and get waters started.  Asking if it was our first time, he was excited to tell us all about the burgers and the process that sets them above the rest.  Drinks came out in a timely manner followed shortly by our sides of fries.  Then the burgers.... Amazing.  Cooked to perfection and the taste was unexplainable.  We were checked on not only by our waiter but other staff members as they walked by.  Not once did we feel like we had to wait for a single thing.  Something got low, it was replaced before we could ask.  All of this while its happy hour and the place is busy???  The prices are a little on the high side but worth the trip back."}
{"text":"Great burger, poor service. Requested ketchup 2times and water at the beginning of meal and it came just in time in time for the last bite."}
{"text":"The food was good but way overpriced. Front desk girls were polite but a phony polite like robots repeating what they were told to say. 25 dollars not including tip for a hamburger fries and a drink NOT including tip. You got to be kidding. My experience felt like they were trying to market and package the emperor's new clothes and expect me to buy into it. Be real"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this a 2 because the other times I've been here the food is fantastic. Please save yourself the headache and hangry attitude and go for a late lunch or early dinner. Most bad reviews don't revovle around bad food, but the hostess staff that have no idea how to seat tables. This is the 3rd or 4th time my family has gone on a Friday, told that it would be 45 mins and I would get a text when a table was ready.

45 minutes and no text. We go up and people who arrived after us are getting seated before us. We get told it will be another 35 mins. On our way out there's tables throughout the restraunt that are bussed and waiting for patrons and a 35 minute wait. This is the 4th time we've left Zinburger and went somewhere else. I never even had this much trouble getting into nightclubs in NYC in the late 90's."}
{"text":"Zinburger is good, but not great. Waiting for a table over 10 minutes is not worth it. My party decided to eat outside. I do like this place more than Delux.. My favorite part of Zinburger was the truffle fries. These fries are great!

My burger was good, but a bit dry. The bacon on my burger was very tasty. The bun seemed fresh and homemade.

I was disappointed in my Kit Kat shake. The shake did taste good, the chocolate was good, but didn't taste like a Kit Kat. I think there was a small chunk of Kit Kat at the bottom of the glass. Not worth $5.

The service was very good. The server was attentive and filled our drinks on a reasonable schedule.

Overall, this place falls below what I like in a burger. Maybe I just like a nice juicy greasy burger and not the trendy place that happens to serve a burger."}
{"text":"OVERATED.  Yes the burger was good but I expect that much if I am paying over $10 for a hamburger.  Not worth the price of admission.  Smash burger is not that far away and definitely the better burger in my opinion.  Delux and the Grind are worth the money.  Zinburger is not."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I eat at the one in Tucson a lot as well.  But this location is great. 

The Zinburger or the Kobe Burger are great options.  The meat is very tender and is definitely a gourmet type burger.  Also the truffle fries are amazing.  This place has an amazing happy hour as well.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a good burger!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Zinburger a few times now. On opening weekend we went and I honestly had the best burger experience of my life. Every time I've been back it's been truly lackluster. My burgers always undercooked and under-seasoned. The service is continually poor, with a lot of staff standing around looking like they've never been trained before and have no manager. My appetizers always take ages to come out. In-N-Out is a cheaper and more reliable alternative."}
{"text":"The food was really good and I love that the menu is simple. They basically have an assortment of burgers, fries, and shakes. The staff was really friendly and I love the atmosphere! The only downside is that it can get pretty busy on Friday or Saturday night since it is part of the mall. We waited about 45 minutes to get seated. However, you can shop around while you're waiting!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of you will disagree with me, but I have to be honest with you, I've never been a fan of Sam Fox Concept restaurants, mostly because the emphasis is on the concept, not the food. And they tend to be outrageously expensive. The exceptions are Sauce, which in my opinion serves insipid food, the Counter (it's 25 cent coffee was the deal of the decade) and the new Zinburger. 

    Of course, Zinburger is easy on the eyes, with it's huge mural of happy cows, and it's lighthearted use of chartreuse accents. Given that it's in the the Biltmore Fashion Park, 
$8-14 for various types of burgers isn't bad - and they're big enough to share. Sides of french fries, fried zucchini, etc. are $3-5, and salads range from $9-14. There are lots of milkshakes and floats at around $6. The trouble, as I see it, is that you can get better for  less bucks at Indulge or BluBurger (particularly if you use a coupon). DeLux is a little less expensive, with a lot more food options, although the ambience isn't as pleasant. I won't bore you with what we ate, suffice to say it was merely okay. 

    My favorite thing is the irony. Zinburger, with it's emphasis on meat, sits a few doors down from Sam Fox's Tru, which specializes in being vegetarian and vegan friendly."}
{"text":"After my experience at The Grind yesterday, I wasn't so sure I could handle another burger place today, but my coworkers wanted to check it out so I went along for the ride. I am so glad that I did! 

The space is bright, cheery and airy, and on a nice day the patio is perfect setting to eat a meal. While not overflowing with options, the menu did at least have more choices than The Grind. I was excited to see a turkey burger, veggie burger and seared ahi burger alongside the beef choices. 

We decided to start with some fries, which do all come a la carte, but they were really good! My favorite were the Zucchini fries, not I might be biased just because I love zucchini, but they were so good! They weren't really all that crispy, but the coating was seasoned right and they had some homemade ranch on the side for dipping. The sweet potato fries were also really good, sliced really thin and served with a yogurt dipping sauce that gave them a Middle Eastern feel. The regular fries were also really tasty, sprinkled with herbs and Parmesan cheese and served with a truffle aioli! 

I ordered the Turkey burger with pepper jack cheese, avocado, lettuce and mayo. I had been wanting a turkey burger since last week, so I had high hopes for this, and well, my expectations were not only met but exceeded! The turkey was juicy, seasoned well and the combination of the cheese and the generous amount of avocado made it just perfect! They make the buns fresh with a combination of white and wheat flour, and wow, they are so fresh and delicious! 

The others in my group had the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple burger, both of them really liked them, saying the meat had good flavor and was cooked well. One of the girls had the Chinese chicken salad and also thought that it was really good. 

They also have a menu full of milk shakes as well as chocolate cream and banana cream pie! We were stuffed and didn't get to sample any of the sweets, but I will try to on my next visit. 

There is a lot of burger competition along Camelback right now, and while a bit on the pricey side ($10) per burger, the freshness and service really make it worthwhile. This is my new favorite burger place!"}
{"text":"Burgers are really good! But the price is crazy, $12 burgers and fries for an extra $5. Had a great time and food was good but just not sure about the prices of the food.
Beer selection is really good, bottles, cans and draft.
Wine selection is really good as well.

Service is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I can't explain my current obsession with burgers. I seem to go through this every once in a while. Maybe as my body prepares for winter. (Concerning since it is currently 112.) 

BUT burgers are my rage. Good thing Honey likes to feed his inner carnivore as well. We've been busy.

We did Zinburger in Tucson early in the summer and had a pretty good experience. Burgers were great, fries were a little more flimsy and undercooked than I liked but held enough promise and flavor (say TRUFFLE) for a repeat attempt. Service was awesome. Now it proved time to join the crowds on Camelback and see how Phoenix's Zinburger ranks. 

The place is cute but - and this may just be ME (ME being from Wisconsin, the land of cheese and dairy farms and cows wandering along the side of the road) - but why do you choose to have a mural of cows in a burger joint? I care NOT to be reminded of the fact that I am eating an animal. And a nice one at that. Cows say Moooo and entertain my daughters and provide the \"nilk\" at our dinner table. How does this entice your customers? Am I supposed to look at the picture of the cows in the pasture and salivate? No. Instead I considered a PETA move and almost went for a gallon of paint. I digress. 

Service was EXCEPTIONAL. We ordered a bottle of Tilia Malbec Syrah(Yum), the Samburger, zucchini fries and of course, the infamous double truffle fries. 

Fries first...again, not sure if I agree with this move. I like to switch between bites of burger and fistfuls of fries and prefer not to fill up on the fries before I have a chance to even try my much needed MEAT. Next time I will ask that it all comes in one fell swoop. 

Fries were perfect. The zucchini fries were thick, appropriately seasoned and breaded and had yummy dip. The truffle fries were SICK. So freaking good. Like stash-them-in-your-purse-for-later good. 

Burger was kindly split for us and perfectly cooked. Bun was super soft, as was the burger (med-rare). It was a good burger. It was not the best burger. I have other burgers that speak to me more than Zinburger. But that's okay. You will like this burger. 

Overall, I'm not sure it's as gourmet as some of the other places we frequent for burgers, but it is solid. Classic, if you will. The fries will keep me coming back. As long as I am not facing the wall of grazing cows, that is."}
{"text":"So our family of four went to Zinburger in Gilbert. We got there at about 7:30 pm. The restaurant was packed. We put in our name and were told it would be about a half an hour. We waited approx 40 minutes. The place was about half empty. So I walked in to check why we haven't been seated yet. The young girl came back with the reason that we had a lot of people not respond to their text messages and it would be another ten minutes. You gotta be kidding me! The staff is too young and they should have some guidance. If there was a manager watching what was happening they should have stepped in. We left. We have eaten here before. The food is great but the service tonight sucked. If I knew we were dealing with incompetent hostess, we would not have come to Zin Burger Gilbert. Gus in Chandler"}
{"text":"Waited for months for this place to open.  Finally got in after work about 4pm.  Services was slow.  Had 2 burgers, Laoded frys, zucchini frys a soda and a beer.  Over $60.00 once we added tip.  As for favor...really nothing outstanding.  Next time We want a good burger I'll go down the street across from the police station.

Nice open restaurant for the younger crowd.  Will we go back...maybe but not any time soon."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get. Decent food, but pricey for burgers and fries for two people. Also, since when did the servers and hostesses who happen to be women have to dress like hoes?"}
{"text":"Never going back!!  We came in Wednesday at 5p and things were pretty quiet. 10 minutes after we were sat, no one had stopped by to offer drinks, menus, or let us know they be back. So we left. And we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally impressed with the Zinburger's quality of food, service and drinks. The atmosphere is small town with a new feel effect. Perfect for family or a date night. My love had the weeks special burger, the Oscar and I indulged in a Kobe beef burger on a GF bun with especially made hand cut GF fries. Delicious! Needless to say we highly recommended this corner gem. If you're looking for quality, fresh meat, vegan options and decent portions this is your place."}
{"text":"Just ate here! Good food! Friendly service! Didn't think it was as good as Zin on Camelback!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

A fancy burger place with wine. Therefore, you only find selections of burgers, a few salads and fries, and of course wine. Came here for a late lunch with parents after shopping, around 2pm, and still got a 10 mins wait (I guess it's saturday). 

Dad had the Plain & Simple burger, the meat was very juice, surprisingly delicious. Mom and I shared the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (yea, i know it's a burger place...) and the hand cut fries. The waitress was really nice, she had our sandwich cut into half and served in two plates with dressings on the side. The fries came in a bucket, enough for three of us. The chicken was really good as well, the meat was tender. But the fries are just so so, honestly, I'd prefer the McDonald's fries.

Everything a la carte so your bill adds up fast. Our waitress was much nicer than the hostess."}
{"text":"First time experience at this place and was not disappointed. Their Samburger was very delicious. If your tired of meh burgers and want a gourmet one, this is the place to go. The bun, meat and ingredients are all top quality. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town. Not cheap but good. And don't forget the milkshake. Heaven!!"}
{"text":"This location is very poorly managed. We always go to the Biltmore location but decided to try something new. If we had gone to this location first, we would have never gone back to Zinburger. Tables were open and not bused while there were about 4 parties waiting. The staff acted like 4 parties waiting was too much to handle. The food was ok but not nearly at the level of the other location. My boyfriends burger was under cooked. The waiter was nice, however it was very clear they were understaffed. Overall, we were quite disappointed with our experience at this location."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since I love burgers and shakes but the burger was just awful. I ordered the Sam burger since I was sure of what to order when the burger arrived and I took my first bit the taste was different the buns were kind of sweet to me and it didn't go very well with the meat, and soon after the buns got to soggy that it made it impossible for me to finish my burger. Over all my experience was not great. I didn't like the taste, feel or the overall burger at all and I would not go back. The only thing I was actually pleased with was the chocolate mint shake."}
{"text":"I was so excited when we saw this first opened in the Quarter. We ate there last night and they had plenty of staff, everyone was very friendly, and the food came quickly. Unfortunately though, that was not enough to compensate for the fact that I got food poisoning and was very ill all night...to the point where I had cancel plans for this evening as well."}
{"text":"Two of us had lunch there Saturday. The service was great-although she was busy she took the time to explain how the menu is designed and answer questions. The food however wasn't very good. 

First, they say they are a burger and wine destination but they have a pretty limited wine list. We ordered a sandwich and salad to share and zucchini fries based on the server's recommendation. The kitchen was nice enough to split the salad and sandwich and plate them separately for us. The wedge salad was way overdressed and the dressing really had no flavor. The grilled buffalo chicken sandwich was ok for flavor but was cold as if the chicken had been grilled ahead of time and not to order. The zucchini fries were heavily breaded and kind of soggy. 

Overall the ambiance is nice and service is good but I wouldn't go back for the food or wine list."}
{"text":"Since the day this place opened it has been busy busy busy. We tried to go at all sorts of time and never did it have less that 30 minute wait. Even on weeknight. Curiously each time we could see empty tables but, well, we don't know how that goes. Finally one time when it was just 2 of us we got a seat at the bar. Bartender was great. Very nice and efficient. Food? Well, it is just burgers. I mean how hard is that? Burger was good but not phenomenal. Everything is a la carte. We got some sweet potato fries. Again you really cannot go wrong with that so no big deal. Seems like they have a following!! Next to us the ladies seemed to have been there enough times to try everything on the menu. And it had opened maybe a couple of months ago!!
Maybe for drinks. Food is not all that it is cracked up to be."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very loud. Burgers were over priced and didn't come with sides. The waitress didn't write our order down and got my 5 year old's order wrong. Long wait for our food. Good things to say-- love the Etch A Sketch and the burgers were tasty."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for a table. Food was decent, the service was terrible. Waited for our food 20 minutes. The fries were not delivered with our burgers. Had to remind the waitress multiple times about them. Manager was sympathetic to our poor dining experience. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Was very excited when this location opened as I had been to the Tucson location! If you go during lunch or dinner, expect a wait.  Their loaded fried are amazing! The burgers are really good, but really big! 
Now lets talk about their shakes. Not really excited about their shakes at this location, when we were at the Tucson location the shake was amazing, thick and yummy! The Gilbert location seems to have very runny shakes, so the second time we went I specifically asked for a \"thick\" shake, unfortunately didn't get it, so they said they would redo it, but it came out the same way. They apologized and said that it was because they were so busy and the machine couldn't keep up. Very disappointed. 
Also it is a bit pricey for burgers.
Will definitely go back...but no shakes :("}
{"text":"I love Fox concepts!  They definitely make the az dining scene much more interesting.  I got to go to the pre-opening dinner tonight at Zinburger in Gilbert and was impressed!  Love the cool chandeliers, the comfy booths and the rollup windows/doors.  I had the zinburger and the onions on it were delicious.  Also had the double truffle fries which were heavenly.  Only complaint would be that the burger/onions dripped a ton so my hands, plate and napkin were covered by the time I was done.  However, it was a small price to pay for a delicious burger and a fun night out!  Definitely will be coming back soon.  The shakes were good too."}
{"text":"Our food was hands down delicious (Bruce Lee burger and veggie burger) but what really gives Zinburger the 5 star review is the amazing service we received. Joseph was our server and he was by far the best server I have had in a long time. He was friendly, available, and genuinely cared about our experience. One of our burgers came without avocado by accident and he immediately fixed the problem no questions asked. He promptly checked to make sure our food was up to our expectations shortly after taking our first bite. I will ask for him next time I come because he was so great and made for an amazing night. We also forgot our to go box and he tracked us down outside the restaurant to make sure we didn't go home empty handed. I will definitely be coming back to Zinburger."}
{"text":"I really like Zinburger despite the pretension and high prices that seem to come along with all Fox restaurants. I am never dissatisfied with the burgers and the shakes are so good. Really so delicious. On top of that, I was particularly impressed with the service at this location (especially since it just opened). I brought my kids and the staff all went out of their way to accommodate us with inordinate amounts of ketchup, substitutions for my picky daughter, and even an etch a sketch. Those are the things that are going to keep me coming back here and make me glad a location opened up so close to my work and home."}
{"text":"SO unbelievably good. The service was prompt and friendly. We visited on a Wednesday mid-day and there was a wait: it's a popular spot :) the burger list is extensive or you can build your own! Sides come a la Carte and we tried the loaded fries to share (big portion). The Nutella milkshake is a must try. They serve Pepsi products (yay!) will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My friends and I went there the week of the grand opening and we were so disappointed. I ordered the \"No Bun\" and it was ok. But for the \"high\" price there is no side comes with the burger ! Also the restrooms are located outside.. I'm not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have only been mildly impressed. 

I would come back here solely for sweet potatoes fries and their shakes. Aside from that, I don't think it has much to offer. Their sweet potato fries come with a yummy yogurt dipping sauce. And you can't go wrong with all their unique shakes - which they're also happy to split 2 or 3 ways for you if you want to share amongst your dining company. 

Their burgers are nothing special - I would much rather go to the Grind or Deluxe which are both nearby. The few times I've ordered burgers here - my bun has been soggy (gross!). An underdone burger and soggy bun are big turnoffs for me! 

I've also had their Roasted Chicken Salad which was just okay and my friend had the Chinese Chicken Salad which he said the same about. Wouldn't order them again, that's for sure. 

As for shakes, I've had the Creme Brulee, Double Chocolate Mint Shake (my fave!) and the Kit Kat Shake. All delish!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is \"WOW\"! Went in with my family last Friday, the day after thanksgiving because no one wanted to cook, and I can't stop thinking about the burger I had! I have a gluten allergy and that was no problem for Zinburger. They assured me that they have a separate fryer and grill just for allergy issues. Really?! No one does that. I had the Sam burger with a gluten free bun, medium. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun held up great even though the burger was juicy. It is an al-a-cart menu so be prepared to pay extra for fries. Those didn't disappoint either. We got the green chili fries and they were dripping with cheese sauce and green chilies. So good. I feel really bad that no one remembers our servers name because she was great. She had long blonde hair. We never had to ask for re-fills or to have our plates cleared. The burger bar has been set. It is now the standard I will have to shoot for. Great job Zinburger!!"}
{"text":"Burgers, fries and sweet potato fries were good and we had good service. For the money you pay you get more bang for your buck at 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Very pricey for a burger $ 45 for 2 burgers fries and 2 glasses of wine and not that good at all.,there are much better burger places out there.We will not be back."}
{"text":"I have to admit the burgers are great but the milkshakes are fantastic! Note to self...split everything I order with someone else. Or risk spit britches followed by a food comma....mmmmm"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for 4 days and ate here twice for lunch.  One of the best burgers I have ever had (samburger both times) and amazing milkshakes (kit kat and butterfinger).  The service was excellent both days.  Ate at the bar the first day and all the bartenders were friendly and timely, even the girl who was on her first day.  Brought the wife and we ate outside and our server was excellent there also.  Great place, please open one in Chicago."}
{"text":"I had never tried Zinburger until last night, and I've gotta tell ya, it was probably the best burger I have ever had. The bread was fresh, the grilled onions were full of delicious, caramelized flavors, and the burger itself was just an overall mouth orgasm. Aside from this, the aioli I used to dip my fries was to die for and the banana milkshake was the icing on this absolutely perfect meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service! Great ambience and family friendly. The veggie burger was one of the best I've had! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Shane was a great waiter our first waitress lowkey ditched us after 20 minutes but you know that's life. We stopped Shane and asked if we could order and he hopped on us. We had some very intellectual conversation. Overall 10/10 experience"}
{"text":"very, very, very poor service despite prices being very high (50$ for 2 burgers an order of fries, and 2 drinks that are no better then what youd get from carls jr). look elsewhere. this place isnt worth wasting the time or the money on. this is the second time we have given this place a try and its been the same result both time. again, shockingly bad service."}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch...the mural of cows in the field is disturbing...opted to sit on the patio. 

This review is based on one salad, the Zinburger and the truffle fries. 

The chicken salad was small for the price and was not that memorable. 

The burger was on a fresh, toasted bun, with beautiful wine-carmalized onions and plenty of mayo. The cheese was nice and gooey. I ordered a medium burger, but it was served well done, so the flavor had disappeared. 

My major disappointment was on the truffle oil fries. If you are going to indulge in the calories, fries should be hot and crisp. Unfortunately, these were room temperature, unevenly cooked and kind of greasy. The truffle aioli was not that memorable either. 

I did not indulge in one of the milkshakes (some amazing sounding recipes on the menu), but will when I try it again. 

The wait staff was friendly and they kept the soft drinks filled."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! I waited months for this place to open here and tonight I finally got to go. I was so disappointed. The burgers were just boring. Nothing special, forgettable even as we were eating them. The truffle fries are nothing special either. I wish I had a time machine to go back in time and not go there. For a delicious burger I suggest Red Robin, or even McDonald's would be better. I didn't even finish my meal as it was that unappetizing. Much better to go down the way to Cheesecake Factory, I wish I had!"}
{"text":"Was contacted almost immediately after my 1/17/17 post to Yelp by the GM at this location who advises that this location is NOT closing and offered a gift certificate to try them again.   Commend the GM for her prompt response to my post and for \"doing the right thing\".   Thank you."}
{"text":"Another Fox restaurant...yawn. 
  We started out on a bad note when we took a seat at the bar to wait for our table. The bar was really cool looking and we loved the idea of using green apples as paperweights. The selection of wine and beer was really decent for a place with a limited menu. The bartender, however, poured us pathetically small glasses of wine. It would have been ok if it appeared to be consistent, but we saw several glasses going out to tables that were much fuller. They weren't exorbitantly priced glasses, but I still want what I'm paying for!
  Next, the food. The zucchini fries were bland and fell apart, but the sauce that they came with was pretty tasty. The truffle fries were lacking in a good truffle flavor. Some of the fries in the basket were soggy and some were burnt. We sent most of them back. The veggie burger was super good. Just about one of the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted, surprisingly. The report from the ahi burger was \"ok\". The report from the Zinburger was \"ok and undercooked according to my order\". The sweet potato fries were delicious. 
  The service was good. Elizabeth busted her butt to get us everything we needed, despite the clear lack of organization in the rest of the restaurant: The place had cleared out considerably by the time we ordered, and it still took about 30 minutes to get our food!
  As with most Fox Concepts, it's all concept and no substance. From most of the other reviews, I don't expect a long wait for tables in this place the very near future."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time.  We had the Blanco Burger and the El Diablo burger, with a side of Sweet potato fries.  Food was good but way over priced.  Service was good,  but the place was really noisy."}
{"text":"Zinburger has a great  menu. Not too complicated. It  has delicious burgers made from beef, turkey, tuna, and my favorite- veggies. It has some yummy salads and the apps are to die for. If you have leftover room in your belly they have the best milkshakes in town. Fresh whipped cream on them all.  I have not ordered anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The kids burger I had was bomb. My mom had the Kobe burger and said it was amazing. They have strawberry lemonade which is fresh. If you eat outside you have a heater or a fireplace near your table. It's very hard to get in because it is very popular but it is worth sitting and waiting till you get a table. They have a bar there for adults. They also have a back entrance which opens at 5:00 and you can order outside without going inside( near the bar outside)"}
{"text":"This isn't normally the type of place I would frequent because the prices are definitely on the high side and the botox customer base are twisting themselves into a pretzel trying to get everyone to notice how trendy they are. 

However, to be fair, the hamburger and fries we ordered were outstanding - definitely a cut above what you'd expect at just a simply burger joint. You can tell the chef definitely knows what he or she is going, gourmet quality, etc."}
{"text":"To date this is my favorite place for a burger! Being from the midwest and growing up on beef, it has been hard to find a great burger out in AZ.  Enjoyed a great bottle of wine (suggestion from the staff), sampled 3 different burgers (to get a real taste for the place) and all were DELICIOUS!!!  Truffle oil fries and sweet potato fries with a root beer float for dessert......it doeesnt get much better than that!!!"}
{"text":"We went here after the farmers market and it was packed! This is definitely not your typical burger. It has a lot of flavor and the meat was fantastic! However, the price is quite up there. It was only lunch and we spent quite a bit."}
{"text":"Great place to stop, while in the area. I always go for the Samburger, although the salads are not bad either. They have a large size beer, and big tv screens playing soccer. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"This place has real great burgers but they are pricey! I always get the breakfast burger and it comes out to $20 after French fries and a soda. Great location, great food, but like I said its kind of pricey!"}
{"text":"Best burger in the Scottsdale or Arizona without question. Kobe meat melts in your mouth as well with other meats too. Fries are top notch as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I hopped on here to read reviews for this place right before going and I'm glad I did. Took someone's advice and ordered the truffle fries and was very glad I did.
We went during lunch hour on a Friday and it was a busy little hive of activity. To sit inside was a 5-15 minute wait so we sat outside. We took the risk of being in the mid-afternoon sun and fighting off a few brave birds that lurked around because we were hungry. We ordered a basket of zucinni fires and the truffle fries. I loved both. Neither were too fried or drenched in batter, both had enough seasoning and deep-fried-ness to them that they were very enjoyable. 

Everyone's food was great and received high remarks. I wasn't a fan of A burger without fries costing $11 bucks, but I understand its gormet and you're paying for the Max Taylor signature atmosphere too. All the wait staff were very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"My burger had too much gristle. Yuck.my husband had a delicious shake.half of our sweet potato fries were under cooked.will not try this place again.over priced for mediocre food:("}
{"text":"The food was really good.  But the banana cream pie is a must!!! Just expect to wait."}
{"text":"The burgers and salads are great but the shakes are what does it for me.  I suggest getting the salted caramel shake."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. They even offered gluten free options for us due to an allergy.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for good food and shakes! Zinburger offers a variety of both burgers, fries, and shakes. Both my husband and I's burgers tasted good! They can make your burger to your liking's and fixings as you wish. Even my daughter's chicken strips had a juicy fried flavor, rather than the bland taste like most chicken strips do in some restaurants. The service was exceptionally well, as our waitress would come by and check how our food tasted and refilled our drinks. We're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Okay I think that about sums it up. If you want a delicious burger, hip atmosphere, and great drinks, this is the place to go. Zinburger was a great experience from start to finish. From our awesome food, to our helpful server, my husband and I enjoyed every part of our meal. At the very end of our meal we ordered one of their house made milk shakes and when they took extra long to bring it to our table (the only slip up) the manager dropped it off, apologized for our long and unnecessary wait and then took it off the bill. We didn't even say anything! We didn't even say one complaint, they just knew! I love when restaurants have high standards like that. I will most definitely be headed back to Zinburger when I get the chance. And may I just repeat, nom nom nom!!"}
{"text":"Way to $$$ for what you get. Burger was good but my medium well was rare. It doesn't come with fries. You but seperatly & don't get many."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best grass fed burgers I've had there!!, Plus it doesn't cost you an arm and a leg just to take one bite. Overall atmosphere was very welcoming and the server was so speedy with my order and everything as."}
{"text":"Being the connoisseur of the Cheese Burger, Condor was anticipating the opening of Zinburger very much. Every week after I would drop $1500 at Ralph Lauren @ The Biltmore, I would monitor the progress of construction to await the opening. 

Well last night was the first time and it was a disappointment. Not for the food, but the service. First: if asked to sit on the side patio, DON'T! It is a bastion of emptiness and inattention. Ordered cheese burger and fries, the fries arrived first and the burger 20 minutes later. I attribute that to \"out of site- out of mind\" of sitting in side patio Siberia. 

Second: if a 6'9\" waiter with dark black hair & anorexic like build is introduced as your waiter: RUN! It was painful to deal with him and his total ignoring. If, however, you are a bevy of underage, under dressed girls, \"Lurch\", as we affectionately named him, is your guy. He will hover over your table and your blouse  to the detriment of his other customers. 

Even more painful was feeling the loss Condor endured by listening to the great waitress our neighboring table had, particularly when describing the delicious nightly Specials I didn't hear about until after I ordered! 

Overall, the buzz Condor missed inside was worth a second trip. Will let you know whether any other \"Addams Family\" waiters are there. i fear \"Uncle Fester\"."}
{"text":"Burger was ok. But the prices were a little high for a burger. Very cool atmosphere though. Probably won't go back. But worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and salads.   Kid's meal Is such a good price  besides making kids happy!      Definitely returning.   Love the way you can make a reservation via your iPhone."}
{"text":"This is a perennial favorite and always regular stop for annual out of town guests.  As always the food was good but for a $14 burger one would expect a bit of service.  Our server did not appear back at our table after the drink orders were served until someone in our party asked the hostess if she could get her.  (someone else brought the food).  We were the first to be seated outside  -- and diners seated after we were who were  next to us were offered refills and were checked in on at least three or four times while we were there.  It was hot and our drink glasses were empty before the food came out.   One refill would have made that $14 hamburger more enjoyable. 

When the server finally came over to give us our check, it was sorry I had a big party.  Okay so younger me know that we weren't important enough for you at least hand us off to someone. 

I won't be back for quite a while."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment choice - thanks Yelpers !  OMG the zucchini fries - you must try them.  Burger was awesome as well.  Cool place!  Meal was worth the price !"}
{"text":"Someone already commented on the large Cow mural, I was not going to because it might just be me, but I have heard a few comments about it now. Yea, really odd choice, and kind of uncomfortable to be eating a burger and having Elsa the Cow, with very sad eyes, staring at you while your biting into one of her relatives. Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact. 
Now I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel. 

Only other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger. If thats not a sign, when customers have to get creative on how to eat at your place without breaking the bank, take a good hard look at how you might make your customers more happy. 
Look at it this way Fox team.

{"text":"THE BEST!  Always hard to decide which burger and fries to try each time...and I love all the happy employees, always a good vibe."}
{"text":"Had the El Diablo with a gluten free bun and a turkey patty. Fries and a chocolate mint shake to round it out. Very tasty although the service was a little slow. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We always have a great meal at Zinburger, the farm salad and of course the burgers are great. Kids love the milkshakes."}
{"text":"I have only been in Az for a year so I am trying new places to eat. This place was amazing the food was good the service was outstanding. My waitress Jamie made my first experience there outstanding. Her service is the reason I would come back."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service!  The shakes are amazing!  Hand made to perfection.  This is my second time here.  The food has been fantastic every time.  Obviously burgers are their specialty.  

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great burger and served fast! Our waitress was super attentive. I had a Kobe burger and my husband had The Ringer. We got regular fries as well as the double truffle fries. This is our new go to for fast burgers! My only complaint was the hostess, rather than telling us our table was ready (we were sitting right next to her) they text us, and when they seated us my chair was wet and dirty, she huffed when I asked her to clean it and missed the big drops of water when she barely swiped the chair."}
{"text":"Delicious burger.  Awesome salted caramel shake."}
{"text":"This place is very clean somewhere you would want to eat at I can see the kitchen from my table which looks clean as well so that's a plus. The food was pretty good I ordered the zinburger and it was decent. Sweet potato fries were awesome as well as the dipping sauce. They also had a good selection of beers on tap. Although this was a good place to grab a burger I think that deluxe which is just up the street right off 32nd and camelback is way better."}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times in 3 weeks! I only eat turkey burgers and they have the best in town. The Blanco Burger is amazing and the truffle fries are equally as good! The wait is ridiculous and there is no place to really wait, but the service and food are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Kobe Steak Burger was unreal Wow !! Was worth every dollar Zinburger will be a main stay every time I'm in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"The best burgers in Phoenix! Their burgers are very tasty and have thick patties. The breakfast burger has a fried egg and bacon that make the burger delicious! The el Diablo burger has a kick to it because of the peppers, which make it very flavorful! Fries don't come with the meal. You have to order it separately. I had the zucchini, sweet potato, and truffle fries. All were fried to a crispy perfection and tasted great! I will definitely come back when I visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Omg! This place makes the best turkey burger I've had yet so far! They are amazing. I went there for lunch and wished I could've stayed to enjoy a glass of wine. Definitely, will be returning. Friendly and fast customer service to top off my five stars."}
{"text":"I had to write something after my most recent visit because the turkey burger is NOT good. The turkey tasted processed; maybe because my palate is sensitive to chemicals, I don't know. It just reminded me of frozen and processed meat. This place does a good job of pretty much every other variety of burger except for that. I've had the Kobe, the veggie and the Zinburger. All good choices. Also, not a huge fan of shredded lettuce. The zucchini fries are super tasty and my sister really liked her BLT salad. We ended up there for lunch on Friday and if we hadn't found seats at the bar it would have been a 30-minute wait. The bar service was surprisingly attentive. We decided it would probably be a good spot to watch a game, too.
For a Fox restaurant, this place could be better. I really like it for the atmosphere and the location but if you want a good turkey burger, go to Islands."}
{"text":"Ahh the Biltmore, where non rich white people go to pretend to be rich (seriously all of my laughs are gone by the end of this), the wait staffs acts the exact same. Okay let me take this back a minute, you walk inside and it's a f-ing putrid smell of raw meat, of course because it's open kitchen. Disgusting. They cook the burgers one temperature under the temperature you actually ordered. They ask to bring the fries out first because they're actually \"hot\" then, even though they're cold...? I know confusing to me as well. The wait staff has an inability to re-fill drinks. This isn't even the worst part. It was my 16th birthday and I got home and started uncontrollably puking till my jaw hurt and eyes turned blood shot red. I went to urgent care, and found out I had mono, with Botulism as the cherry on top. I was hospitalized for four weeks due to complete Botulism symptoms (slurred speech, no saliva, no oxygen the works), and Mono (fevers high grade, very very weak, low blood pressure, red puffy eyes, and again labored breathing). I'm so done with Fox Resteraunt Concepts, their pretentious wait staff is forever a problem but hospitalization for something I could've died from, because of someone's  careless mistake."}
{"text":"First time.. Only time.

I ordered the blue cheese mushrooms burger and waited forever for it to arrive. I was blown away at the tiny size of this $11 burger. It tasted fine, but the price is ridiculous for what this place is. If you want to feel like you're in a nicer place than your average burger joint, I guess it has a certain appeal.

Food...? Pretty good.
Service...? Super slow and just bad in general.
Value...? Not.

I don't understand why all these restaurants on Gilbert Rd. have become so full of fluff and high prices. What happened?"}
{"text":"We were in town for a 3 day event and dined here twice.  The Bruce Lee burger is worth the stop alone.  However, we split the ringer, the breakfast burger and the buffalo chicken.   All great. We tried all the fries YUMMY!!!!

The servers were great and remembered us from one day for the next! 

Great place to eat."}
{"text":"They have amazing food! Their veggie burger and fries are really good. They also have amazing zucchini fries. The people I go with eat their regular burgers and they said it was cooked perfectly and we all can't wait to go back!

The inside decor is super cute and has milk bottles as lights! I have eaten here twice and will be coming back more!"}
{"text":"Clean and simple, easy experience! The environment is super fast and the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the management of this facility. My hubs and I came here impromptu on our way to hale theatre. Having never been here before we weren't sure what to order... We ordered several drinks, appetizers and burgers off the menu. Well - short story short - I wasn't a 100% sold on my choice and our lovely waiter mentioned this to his manager.  The management came to me personally and asked me about our experience (which really was great - apps were fantastic, drinks were delicious and the burgers were good too). Having worked in upper management in retail, I understand good customer service and I can tell you - Zinburger is top notch. You won't regret eating here and sharing your patronage with such an attentive restaurant. Bravo! We will be back! P.s. Sharing my experience here with my team as an example of exemplary customer care."}
{"text":"Overall good burger.  I had the Bruce Lee which was special for that week.  Tasted great needed a little more spice. Not sure if the kobe beef was worth the price though.  Enjoyed it overall."}
{"text":"Kind of over rated. Enjoyed my burger, but have had far better at Tim Finnegans or the Original Wine Burger. I'd go back if I was at the Biltmore and friends wanted to try it, but no major rush."}
{"text":"Loved it!! I got the zinburger and a side of zucchini fries. I ordered my burger medium, and it turned out juicy and flavorful! Everything about it was great- the size, the onions, the cheese, the bun-- it was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. The zucchini fries were just as amazing with a well seasoned crust and parmesan! Even my boyfriend loved them and he hates vegetables! Between the two of us (2 burgers, side of zucchini fries, and 2 drinks) it came out to be about $40. And the price was definitely worth it. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been there several times over the last few months.  Burgers are awesome and beer selection is good.  The last visit was a little disappointing, plenty of servers but really slow service.  However, the food is worth the wait and try the salted caramel shake!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location! The food was great!!! I had the turkey burger which was probably the best turkey burger I've ever had and my fiancé got the sameburger, which he loved. He added onions and a side of sauce since it was a little dry. Then we topped off the order with the loaded fries and a cookies and cream milkshake! The atmosphere is welcoming with a young hip vibe. Definitely a great place to go on a double date. 
Only bad part about our dining experience was our server Catie. She got my fiancé's order wrong, forgot about our request for sauce, split our checks wrong and made several excuses for her mistakes. Needless to say we got better service from the bus boy. 
Overall a great place to eat with good food and a great time! .... just don't request Catie ;)"}
{"text":"Very great place. Food & shakes were excellent. I usual drive all the to hopdoddy for a great burger glad this place is closer. Service was on point too."}
{"text":"Simple but to the point review that my group of four wanted me to write.  Food was hot and fresh and good.  Service stunk!"}
{"text":"i love this concept of a hip burger and wine joint. or that could be burger and shake or burger and beer. a simple menu done well in a cool atmosphere at a good price is the way to go. well done zinburger. and kudos on a deece beer list."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely great. I am not a huge red meat person so I can be pretty picky about my burgers. This place hit a homer with me. Loved the location and ambiance. The double truffle fries are super delicious and my burger with the gluten free bun was on point. The milk shake I ordered was more milk than anything but either way in a whole this place is one I cannot wait to come back to in the best future."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST place to get a burger. Their signature burger features Zinfandel caramelized onions, Yum! I have also tried their ahi tuna burger, with coleslaw on it, also delicious. 

I come here for their turkey burger. It is literally the most amazing turkey burger I have ever had. It is so juicy and their buns are to DIE for. The turkey burger also features avocado, Swiss cheese, and sprouts. Don't pass it up. Even if you would not regularly eat turkey burgers, it is still a must try item. You will not be disappointed.  

They also have a decent wine list. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim and was not disappointed .   Food was so fresh and delicious.  Definitely a restaurant to come back to time and again"}
{"text":"In my other reviews you'll see that I love nearly all the Fox Restaurants. Which is true. For Zinburger, this is where the *nearly comes in. 

I've eaten there more than a few times and on every occasion its been OK. -Which is why it gets 2 stars- The menu is tiny, but its a gourmet burger joint so you really can't ask for much else. The zucchini fries are triumphant. Truly wonderful. The burgers sound amazing when reading them but more than once they've come out just OK. Nothing terrible, but not as mouthwatering as they made them sound. I like how the wine list is portioned out too... pretty cut and dry. Don't bother asking your server about the wines though, they probably will just look at you with a stupid look on their face. 

If you're with a big burger person and you're not a burger person, do not fret. They have TWO really good salads, so don't get too excited. My favorite is the one with pomegranate seeds and goat cheese, with or without chicken. Its very light and fresh. 

On my last occasion my server was slow, meek, and dull. Having zero personality is one thing, but when she realized she forgot about my glass of wine and I had to remind her (about ten minutes later) she became very timid and hardly even came back to our table! I wasn't rude.. so I don't understand why she had a manager come by to drop it off. Anyway, it could just be me. 

So all in all this place isn't bad FOOD wise... drinks are pricey and service has tended to suck."}
{"text":"Been here many times.....good but I felt like their burger was a little bland.  Needs more zing options."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of Sam Fox restaurants and were looking forward to the Zinburger opening in Gilbert. We expected the wait (45 minutes at 5:30pm on a Thursday) but when we finally got to a table it was one with a round bar stool for a seat. In looking around, I could see that there were very few chairs that seemed remotely comfortable. 

Overall, it was a big let down. The wine was the highlight of the meal. We both ordered burgers that turned out to be nothing special. The meat was cooked properly, but like one other reviewer said, it was so greasy and the bun so flimsy I ended up eating just the meat about half way through. Honestly, I think SmashBurger does a better job.

For a side, we ordered zucchini fries. I was hoping for crunchy sticks and got a plate of limp, greasy breaded zucchini with the tiniest amount of dipping sauce. We also ordered the latte milkshake. It was good, and they did split it into two smaller glasses for us, but nothing I would go out of my way to have again. 

The service was just okay, too. Our waiter was nice enough, but the other three employees who brought food/drinks to our table never said a word. None of them even made eye contact with us. After the third one, my husband made a \"Stepford\" comment. 

At this time, Zinburger is not worth the wait or the money. In our minds the gold standard of burgers is Burger Bar in Las Vegas. This place falls so short of it, we won't be back."}
{"text":"If you like high end burgers, this is your spot. My burger was cooked to perfection with quality ingredients. The appetizers here are awesome. The price is a little on the higher side for a burger joint but this shouldn't come as a surprise. Great food!"}
{"text":"All the food was delicious. Portions were good. Servers and hostesses were all friendly and knowledgeable. The prices are what was disappointing. Burgers don't come with fries so you're paying extra for fries or onion rings. 2 burgers, fries, onion rings, and 2 soft drinks. $38.00."}
{"text":"We came for early dinner on New Year day. It boasted premium burger place that serve fresh ingredients. Both burgers, Zinburger and El Diablo, lacked taste, we had to add salt and pepper ourselves. Service was so-so with no smiling waitress. Ambience was a bit noisy, but we could still converse without shouting. It's just okay for us."}
{"text":"Burgers were all amazing, but should be bigger. About the size of a Burger King  patty.  But they are cooked to perfection. Wait staff not real attentive, but they are friendly, little slow to check on you or get you your bill.  Wine was not real good.  Overall good experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love Zinburger!  Living in North Scottsdale there are an endless array of dining options but we both agree that Zinburger provides the best combination of great food, great fun and great people. As far as the food is concerned everything I have tried is wonderful and the fries are to die for. While the food is stellar  It is the people that keep us coming back time and again.  I must give my most sincere compliment to the bartender, Tony. He always has a smile on his face and is eager to help. In today's day it is unusual for someone to remember your drink of choice and greet you by name. He amplifies an already wonderful experience by adding a very nice personal touch. He makes us want to return and when we see him we know we are going to have a great experience. I have brought clients here and he always gives the best recommendations on both food and drinks!  While we tend to know what we like to drink, Tony gave us a great suggestion just the other night and he was absolutely spot on. We have a new favorite thanks to Tony! If you are looking for a fun evening out in a beautiful setting give Zinburger a try, you will love it. If you're lucky enough to sit at the bar when Tony is working you're in for a wonderful treat."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out. I got my phone replaced today from the apple store and on my way out I thought I'd get a burger to go. 

The place was incredibly packed. Dude at the bar was cool, girls at the front were really nice. It took a long time to get the burger but It's not McDonnalds and I had zero expectations of being in and out. 

I just finished my burger and it was so good, I had to jump on yelp and write a good review for the place. 

I'll call ahead next time i want one to go but the place was so cool, I'll probably want to just eat there. Check it out if you havn't already."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place. I had heard all the hype and possibly the best burgers in town. Not at all. HopDoddy is way better! My wife's burger was so greasy and mine was too spicy to even eat, and I am Mexican!"}
{"text":"Great food and  really good service! The bartender was awesome and attentive. Our waiter did a great job! I would have given 5 stars but the hostesses were not so great.... No personality and they acted like they hate their job. It actually made us a little uncomfortable. I think they need a complete turnover of the hostess staff."}
{"text":"We all had different hamburgers to try. Each arrived with a few pickles on a small plate. We had sides of onion rings that were each in a basket on top of a square of paper. 
Each of us commented that the patty was good but not the best we have had especially for the price. We also commented that the individual add-ons were good, but the toasted bun was not special and cold. 
Service was fast and helpful.
Decor is good with plenty of seating inside and two outside areas. Air system well designed to keep the restaurant cool without blowing on you."}
{"text":"Went to lunch today with my daughter and friends. When the air conditioning came on dirt and dust fell on top of us. We as well as the the table were cover with a layer of dirt.  They comped our  fries .  Really fries! How about the whole meal guys!!!! Very that                              


Update 

After reading the review that I wrote, Zinburger took the time  to make contact with me and apologize for the inconvenience . They offered me a gift certificate as well as a full refund for our lunch. The letter of apology was highly professional. Thank you so much for making things right!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! The food is awesome all the giant burgers are worth the price! Your can order delicious, sides like fries, macncheese and onion rings! My favorite thing is the loaded fries and the bacon burger or the breakfast burger! The outside seating is so beautiful but on the side during the sunset, the sun does sorta blind you. recommend if you want a gourmet burger joint."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint. We had a Kobe burger and a Zin burger, zucchini fries and regular fries. Aside from both burgers being cooked med well (one was ordered med rare), the meal was quite enjoyable. Good service, solid menu, and decently executed food."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend. It was my first time here. The food was amazing! We ordered the zucchini fries which are the best I've had! I also had the Red Zingria, it was delicious. Like some of the others have said our wait was an hour, which sucked. The food and drinks were worth it. Can't wait to come back."}

{"text":"We were a party of seven adults, three around 30 and four, 60+.  For two of us, it was our third time to Zinburger, but we always sat outside.  The others had never been.  It was a busy Saturday night and we were told wait time would be an hour, but we were seated in half that.  However, it took 47 minutes from when we sat down for food to arrive.  This is perhaps understandable on a busy Saturday night and would have been tolerable but for the noise level.  

The interior of the restaurant is all hard surfaces that make it like a gymnasium inside.  Conversation was impossible, even with the person seated next to me.  Our server, when taking orders, screamed back the order into the ear of each person to be sure she heard it correctly.  For some unknown reason, there was recorded music playing, but we all later agreed we could only barely hear it above the echo-y noise level and it just added to the general din.  I cannot understand how architects can design such a space for a restaurant.

So, we sat waiting for food, staring at each other, unable to communicate.  The food was mediocre and two of our party did not finish their burgers.  If you are OK with waiting three-quarters of an hour for average food, during which time you cannot communicate with the person next to you, you may want to try Zinburger.  Otherwise, I'd suggest trying elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful staff. Our sweet waitress was interested in us and our vacation. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat a fancy schmancy finger licking good burger, then you should hit Zinburger.

I had a veggie burger, with one of the yummiest bloody marys in town...baconized goodness in a tall glass of awesomeness, no lies.

 My friend had the Tukey burger and LOVED it. Now, that is saying a lot since she doesn't enjoy eating any kind of meat. We both shared some sweet potato fries, that just hit the spot. 

On another occasion I had the Zucchini Fries and THE Zinburger and a Bananas Foster shake...it shook my world, oh yeah. 

Enough said...

Check it out."}
{"text":"This place is EPIC.

I don't usually eat burgers but when I do I look for the highest quality, freshest ingredients, attention to detail and everything in between.

This place lived up the hype a local had told me about the day earlier.

One of the best burgers I've ever had, the service and vibe were awesome and you could tell they think about everything.

Note: great for ultra-healthy people too and they will customize anything to make you happy."}
{"text":"Ok went back with Mom & Dad and it passed the Mom & Dad lunch test with flying colors.  Wound up getting the small BLT salad which had an awesome ranch dressing...yeah ranch dressing rocked.  Shared an order of truffle fries, from which I soon expect Ill to need an intervention.  The truffle fries cannot get into my mouth fast enough.  P-rents enjoyed their burgers.

Service was great."}
{"text":"Place is great. Good food good drinks. I came in on memorial day wasnt expecting it to be as full as it was, good service, if your looking for a younger crowd and dont want to be staring at cows, i would keep heading east to oldtown."}
{"text":"I don't know if I would be categorized as a die-hard Fox-Fan - ok, maybe so, but I was a bit disappointed.  (Sorry Sam, here's my 1st 3-star for you - and I've written over a dzn rvws with 4+ stars for you).

 I had visited the Tucson location about half a dozen times previous to coming here. 

Turkey burger was boring. 
I had forgotten that nothing comes with your burger - 
you would think that for $9-12 for a burger you would get a side?  

Nope.  

So is a burger here worth $15?  (how can u not have a side?) 

Nope.  

Did the bill justify what was experienced?  

Nope.  

A side salad was miniscule, albeit tasty. So, over-all I was bummed in the end.  I think I'll be back, but only for their specials mid-afternoon where appies are 50% off, along with half-off wine, which would then be value for what you get.  Yes."}
{"text":"Zinburger is a very decent place to go for a burger. I ordered a burger with wild and morel mushrooms, cooked medium. It was tasty and cooked to perfection; however the morel mushrooms were literally pulverized along with all the other mushrooms. You couldn't differentiate between them in the miasma. My only criticism about the burger is that if you are going to use a very expensive ingredient, please do not destroy it and make it unrecognizable. 

The fries were hot and fresh, and the ranch dressing I asked for was tasty. 

My friend ordered his burger medium rare, and unfortunately it arrived medium well. He ate it anyway because he was hungry and didn't want to wait any longer (they were very busy so the long wait for our food is forgiven).

The hostesses and servers buzz around the restaurant as if it were a hive; constantly cleaning, picking over the tables, asking if anyone needed anything. This is awesome. The only bad thing about the atmosphere is the customers, themselves! The crowd was VERY loud. Screaming children, women drinking too much wine and talking at the TOP OF THEIR LUNGS when it's not necessary to. It's a very loud experience. 

I will be back. Definitely not on a packed Saturday night, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Incredible! We were given the suggestion to come here and it was wonderful.  The restaurant is located in a busy area but it is not congested. It's a Friday night and the crowds are not too heavy. The burgers are fantastic. I had the Blanco and my sister had the El Diablo. We shared the loaded fries. The burgers are huge and the fries huge portion. Great all away around. Except being a southern girl we love our sweet tea--none here. But that's ok. Our meal was fabulous. We are taking a chocolate malt and slice of banana cream pie to go. If you are anywhere in the area you need to eat here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch again today.  Hostess staff  - so friendly.

Food is outstanding.  No joke.

Service is dyn-o-mite. 

Very reasonable lunch for the Bilty area.

Additionally, you should know every Scottsdale Culinary Fest in the spring for the past 3-4 years has had a \"Burger Battle\" at Scottsdale's Giant's Stadium on Thursday night where local restaurants grill and distribute burgers to beef connoisseurs like me. 

Best event of the year (beer's included in the ticket price).

Well, these guys are 2014 People's Choice Award Winners, for good reason.  

The trophy does the talking, so let your mouth do the tasting."}
{"text":"Absolutely great. Excellent food AND service. Low wait times.... I could not find a negative even if I tried. The General Manager, William, is a true artist in costumer satisfaction. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Disappointing service which is why I am compelled to write a review! I went in at about 9 pm on May 19th, saw 2 hostesses chatting by the door, walked in - took them about 5 minutes to stop having their giggly conversation and ask me in.
I asked to be seated by the bar - was told I could go right ahead. Then came my struggle period. It took the bar tender 20 minutes (timed by the watch) to look towards me and offer me a menu. I asked for a recommendation - was given a lackluster answer. I ordered my wine and buffalo sandwich. It was mediocre at best. The Pinot Grigio ($5 a glass) was fine. I was not served water throughout the meal. I finally spent another 10 minutes trying to get someone to get me water. This was a wednesday night post 9 pm.... it's not like the place was bustling with people. Even though I live around the corner, this is a place I will not go back to. Sorry Zinburger - you just lost a potential regular!"}
{"text":"Burger was great had the Kobe Zinburger. The bun is what made the burger! Great flavor I also had the truffle fries they were good a little light on the truffle flavor but still good I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to Zinburger Halloween night. Decent crowd but not too busy.  Split the green chili fries and plain and simple burger with manchego and shrooms!  The fries were tasty but very rich.  Next time I'm getting the truffle fries.  The burger, OMG, delish.  Cooked to perfection, juicy, and really really good.  Wine was great for a decent price too.  The best part of our visit were the bartenders.  They all took care of us and they were all great!  Waited for a long time for this place to open and it was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good burgers and even better milkshakes dangerously delicious shakes! The lettuce bun could be more lettuce and they should use romaine lettuce instead not iceberg lettuce!"}
{"text":"We stopped into this place because it was right across from our hotel. So glad we did. It was delicious! I had the Bruce Lee! Wow!!! She has wheat allergies and they even had her covered! Gluten free buns and separate cook station to avoid cross contamination!!! The fries serving size is huge and they split it up half regular and half sweet potato!"}
{"text":"the first time I went here, my sister and I split each of our burgers so we both got a taste off the turkey burger and samburger,aong with the sweet potato fries. The meat is perfectly cooked, the sauces and aiolis are on point, and those fries cooked in the truffle oil are crazy good! Second time I went to zinburger, I tried their ahi sandwich, with an addition of roasted peppers. Again, they didn't disappoint my taste buds at all. The fish was cooked rare and the peppers, bread, and avocado all complimented the fish. My friend and I split an order of sweet potato fries, and paired with the yogurt dipping sauce, they are the perfect side with their sandwiches and burgers. For dessert, we split banana cream pie. Now, I've never eaten banana cream pie before this and I'm happy I did, because my life would have been incomplete without this experience. The sweet cream, with carmel drizzled over it, the crumbly crust, the perfectly sweet bananas... I might just have to go back just or the pie! They have an extensive choice of shakes, so I might have to accompany my pie with a shake... Which is the perfect recipe for a sugar coma. Along with the delicious food, the atmosphere provides a hip feel, as all the Fox restaurants do, that is comfortable while still feeling sophisticated. The service here is awesome, the young lady who sat was polite and smiley, and our server was eficient and informative when we asked about the menu. If you want a good burger... GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food!  not so much for the service,  when you first walk in its difficult to figure out where the hostess station is.  Our waitress was not very nice and did not do a very good job which is sad because we frequently dine out and bring friends and family along.  we did notice that other wait staff were attentive to their patrons so I am willing to try Zinburger again and hope to get better service."}
{"text":"We called Zinburger to make a reservation on Saturday for a larger party. We have been doing this for several years and have enjoyed our food (PS we are good tippers). A man was put on the phone, he was very condescending to us. He informed us that \"they don't do reservations for big parties and they never had and he had been there for a year and a half. If they were to take our reservation it would hurt their business.\" Seriously?! At least try to be nice. At least say, hey, we don't accept reservations anymore, I am sorry. Or even offer to do a reservation but make it earlier in the evening.   I could accept any of that. But don't make it seem like I am going to ruin your business by making or even suggesting a reservation. Please have the common courtesy of giving some nice customer service."}
{"text":"Sam Fox is making money hand over fist at this gem of a spot. We arrived late by lunch standard mid-week and the place was packed to the gills.  It was a perfect day to sit on the patio. I loved the people watching . . . and dog watching. I wish we had brought ours with us. They, too, would have enjoyed it!

Service was excellent, even at such a busy time. We ordered some sides to start, zucchini fries and sweet potato fries.  The zukes were delicious, cooked in an ultra-lite batter and sprinkled with a little parmesan. The sweet potato fries were equally as good. Both were large portions!  Not a meat lover, I ordered the ahi sandwich minus the slaw and avocado and topped with braised onions and wild mushrooms. Absolutely splendid! My hubby ordered the Kobe burger, a nicely seasoned chunk of Kobe covered with cheddar cheese and wild mushrooms. The best he's had in a long, long time, he said.

I don't know where he put it, but my dear husband ordered the salted caramel shake. Wow is all I can say about the one \"bite\" I had . . . so thick and creamy . . . I was on Cloud Nine . . . and my husband was in a food coma afterwards! Yummy all the way around!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was slow. Disappointed that the burgers did not come with fries."}
{"text":"Food and service is great! I usually get the Samburger and Sweet Potato Fries. The Zucchini Fries are really yummy too. Hopefully they open one on the west side soon!"}
{"text":"Good, decent burger but wanted medium rare and got medium instead. The server tried to confirm my request for medium rare when ordering as if I don't know what it means, but it came out over anyway.  Onions were pretty good: nice and crispy and most didn't allow the onion to come slipping out. Nice cheap, but excellent wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! I ordered the truffle fries and they were everything and more. Burgers are simple but delicious! I also came at prime time for dinner on a Saturday but the wait was nothing as we were able to get seated at the bar since there was just 2 of us. Food came very quick as well. Staff is extremely friendly & helpful with recommendations. Will most certainly return!"}
{"text":"I like the decor, and the bar has a really nice openness to it.  Service staff was friendly, and the drink menu had some interesting cocktails that I would go back for.  The food is okay.  The zucchini is good, but I recommend splitting an order.  The burger I got was the weekly special, which had a lot if things going for it, because this special was similar to an In N Out burger.  It was overly greasy though, and the bun is very sweet, which was amplified by the sauce on the special burger.  I don't think I would go back if I knew the sweet, sponge buns were on every burger."}
{"text":"I loved zin burger I had the grass fed burger or something of that sort and a vanilla shake!!!! So good great service!!!!! I love a juicy fresh burger 
And you will definitely get that here.!!!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 12.   Had a great time.  Staff were overly gracious with helping on the drinks.  We didn't like one and they replaced right away.   Manager Cole was a hoot and made us all feel like family.  We had various meals and the loaded fries appetizer was great.   We highly recommend the restaurant and the location which is in a booming growth areas has other fun stuff to do."}
{"text":"Good food and interesting atmosphere but too expensive for what it is in my opinion. They need to offer a smaller amount of fries, as I was by myself and clearly they were meant to be shared."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out and dined in several times- this place is not recommended for people looking to be \"healthy\"!  Every time I go here I think I'll get a salad but then I read the menu and get a burger instead! 

Last time we tried zinburger was a double date- we ordered truffle fries and sweet potato fries for the table.  The boys had beer which zinburger had some nice options on tap.

For food my date and I decided to share the farm salad which really was quite good!  The burger we shared was a spicy one diablo?  We ordered it medium which it was cooked properly with a chipotle aioli and jack cheese.  There was too much runny sauce all over the burger but it tasted great.

Next time I want to try a milkshake- they have several gourmet options!"}
{"text":"Really cool spot with a simple menu. Definitely would recommend for lunch or a laid back dinner."}
{"text":"Its very hard to find a excellent burger around town.But Zinburger is an exception.It has great appetizers that make you hungry for more.

I recommend the Buffalo Burger.It has just about enough spice for you to keep sipping for your drink.Its the juicest burger I had in awhile."}
{"text":"Great Hot Food. Hava Chicken and Sam Burger were great!  Only you need to switch the sauce with your sweet potato fries. The yogurt dip was not that good."}
{"text":"OK is about all I can say.  For all of the hoopla and hype behind this restaurant, I expected more of a gourmet or specialty hamburger but didn't think it measured up to that standard at all.  In addition, my medium well ordered zinburger was cooked medium rare.  A manager came over to ask how everything was and I showed her the problem, for which she apologized and removed the charge from our bill.  She must have somehow blamed our waitress (it wasn't her fault but the kitchen's) because the waitress didn't speak a word to us afterward...just slapping the bill down on the table and huffing off...very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Zinburger proved to be everything it's cracked up to be and then some!  No wonder it wins awards for Best Burgers! The meat was flavorful & cooked to perfection and the brioche bun was amazing.  The wait-staff was very attentive and helpful.  The overall experience was 5-star.  I had the Samburger and my wife had the Zinburger and both were outstanding although we agreed the Zinburger was slightly tastier with its braised onions.

We got there at 11:30 AM to beat the lunch crowd but the place was already packed, so pick your spots.  If you think it might be too far to go for a burger or that $10 is too expensive, think again...it's worth the drive and the money."}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss with the specialty burgers, it seems like they are either awesome or they totally suck, no in between for me.  The truffle fries are really terrific though, and the wait and bar staff is mostly top notch.  Good choice if you want a gourmet burger and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had El Diablo burger...very good. With truffle fries...good. Good beer selection. Had tasty shake. Good value."}
{"text":"Sitting in Zin burger right now. Service is AMAZING! Must try the frys. Lexi is taking great care of us and we will back soon!!"}
{"text":"My first visit. The quality of the beef is good. Overall, I found the burger bland. The bun was squishy and fell apart. The place is new and stylish. One style I am not a fan of is lots of tv and no nice abatement in the decor."}
{"text":"The place is ok, but not great. Everything is a la carte and the prices can add up pretty fast. Get a nice burger with few topping plus fries and a drink and you are looking at around $20/person. Delux is just as good, if not better, and delivers a better price.

That said, my burger was tasty and the zucchini fries were good as well. Not sure that I would go back, but worth a least a try."}
{"text":"Ate at Zinburger 9/24 with my wife and two friends who re-located from Milwaukee.

Since I had never contemplated mixing beer and ice cream I had to satisfy my curiosity and started the evening with the Black Lager Float - that's right - an ice cream float made with a dark black lager.  Where has this cocktail / dessert been all my life!

Zinburger is a la carte and be spendy (which is to say I don't know if it would work in my beloved hometown of Milwaukee).  We got one order of each of the four types of fries - loved the sweet potato fries (with yogurt dipping sauce) and the zucchini fries (with parmesan and ranch)

I ordered the Samburger - Nueske's bacon, american cheese and thousand island dressing.  The meat was flavorful and cooked perfectly, the bun was fresh, warm and had some \"puffiness\" to it - Nueske's makes everything perfect and this burger was no exception.

The decor of the place was simple and casually elegant and the vibe was energetic.  Definitely a fun and tasty night!"}
{"text":"If you want a delicious burger Zin Burger is where is at in Gilbert. We enjoyed two side zucchini ,sweet potato fries and burgers to order. Servers were polite , prompt and knowledgeable about menu items. The establishment was bright and open. A well deserved return trip."}
{"text":"Zinburger is know for having some of the best burgers in Phoenix. They have a variety of themed burgers that come expertly prepared on a fresh bun with gourmet toppings. Add in a fun atmosphere and a great drink selection and it makes for a great burger experience. There's something for everyone on the burger menu at Zin."}
{"text":"First time here. As you might expect a good selection of wine and other libations. Not as impressed as I thought I would be. Burgers were good but double truffle fries were overcooked and flavorless."}
{"text":"Excellent service and ok prices but no tomato on a burger?  Really?   Meat perfectly cooked.  Lettuce was shredded, onions minced and both few and far between.  Bun deteriorates under stress. Excellent fries. Overall,  B+ burger.  Basically a higher class  McDonalds."}
{"text":"There is a special place in my heart for you, Zinburger. I haven't been to Arizona in quite some time, but my family and I love this place. Absolute fave! I either get The Sam Burger, the regular Zinburger, and another burger I can't remember the name of. Oh, and we always order zucchini fries, regular fries, and onion rings. I'm salivating just thinking about it."}
{"text":"We just left and will go back for burgers anytime we are in the mood.

5 minute wait for a table is not shabby for Saturday. 

Service was speedy and personable. 

Split the Carmel milkshake with the wife and it was worth it.  I did not share my burger with her, as she pointed out to me after I was finished.  She enjoyed her burger and the fries. Both were cooked spot on temp wise and super juicy and tasty. 

She said the best burger she can recall and I second that."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place. Can't eat their regularly due to the fact that my waistline would explode and my wallet would wither away, but it's great and always a pleasant treat. 

Their burgers are huge, and my guy and I have decided that the best course of action is to order 1 burger (they will half it for you and bring out each half on its own plate) and 2 sides (zucchini fries, sweet potatoes, or truffle - they're all good!)   I usually get either the turkey burger or the Zinburger, and both are excellent.

I wouldn't recommend the salad, as I had one once, and for $10 bucks, it was awfully small and not worth the money.  The shakes look great, but there's so much food elsewhere that I've never ordered one."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and great attitude by all employees. Very loud and could be cleaner."}
{"text":"I'd only been to Zinburger once before - the first time I was seated inside and the second outside. Both times I remember the food more than anything. Their burgers are delicious, as well as their fries and shakes. 

The service was average, somewhat slow at times, but the food was delivered in a very timely manner - and boy was it good. 

I'd recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for a very reasonably priced, incredibly high-quality burger."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Went here for lunch with my husband and nephew.  First the parking is odd, but free.  We were seated right away.... and the server was amazing.  He knew it was our first time and explained everything.  His recommendations were spot on!  The onion rings are amazing.   I added pictures of the burgers... all delicious!!!! This place was a little far from the west valley,  but 100% worth the drive.  

Little expensive for a burger,  but I'll be back for sure!   Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place! I love the what they are doing here. I'm a total wine person and normally you can't find a truly good wine at a place that specializes in burgers so I am hooked. I normally get the Zinburger with the Tobin James Zinfandels and the Double Truffle fries and I will sit there for over an hour waiting to get more room in my stomach just so I can finish it all. 

They just switched up the happy hour menu which I am not happy about, but it just makes my bill about $3 more which I can live with. Just this past time I realized I do appreciate that they added the smaller sized burgers to happy hour, however. They don't advertise them correctly; they call them slider sized, they are 4oz or about quarter pounder size which is perfect for me compared to the 7oz normal sized burger. Now I just get that over the regular burger which actually brought my bill down a dollar and made my walk back to the car more of a true walk and not a painful waddle from how stuffed I used to be.

My only recommendation is that they add the smaller patties to the normal menu because I would never go back to eating a full sized burger unless I was feeling like a bottomless pit and that is going to restrict how often I go back. My husband enjoys the 7oz patties and I don't think that option should be taken away, but he is nearly double my size at 6'5 with a healthy appetite so he could use the extra caloric intake."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I got a zinburger with a glass of zin and my husband got a my boy blue with a peach ale. We shared the double truffle fries and fought over the last several. I actually threatened the love of my life with a fork over fries and I have 0 regrets. I found myself regretting not coming here sooner."}
{"text":"Very, very good. Went on a quiet Wednesday because otherwise the place roars. The server was attentive and perkily annoying.  I had the Zinburger and it didn't disappoint. The burger was cooked perfectly and the zin marinated onions was a nice touch. The onion rings were exceptional. I am not sure if they tasted so good because it was early in the day or if they really do something special with them. Two tall beers completed the order for $42.00 before tip. That seems a bit pricey for the a Wed. lunch. Tried it and really 
 liked it, but don't need to repeat."}
{"text":"This is an excellent choice for the high end  burger place.  Full liquor license, food is served on china and they provide full service.  Excellent burger and quality onion rings. Look forward to returning to try shakes and other burgers.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and ask for my girl, Tabitha, and Chase! They are the bomb dot com. No matter if they're busy or slow, they'll be sure to take care of you with a smile and a great sense of humor! The food is amazing. The environment is fun. The people make it the go to happy hour place - everyday!"}
{"text":"i was going to leave a lengthy review but it seems that I'm not the only one who sees poor management when it comes to wait times and open tables never mind the people they turn away because they tell them 1-2 hour wait good way to invite them to the bar for a drink while they wait just an option rather then seeing $$ walk away considering you have open tables 
the girl who checks in people and takes there names needs an attitude adjustment and needs to understand what her job really entails she is not friendly not even fake friendly doesn't not seemed concerned that there were open tables and people were walking out i am a business owner and was furious to see the amount of people turned away and i have no stock in Zinburger 
either way the food is meh the burger buns were consistently soggy across our table 10-14$ for a burger with no sides other the three slices of a dry pickle that was cooked under the warming light is disgraceful 
the only reason i am leaving two stars at that is because our waiter was a great personality he has some crazy wavey hair and was conversational even though he forgot our over priced side of fries im glad he did because at that point it was 3 hours since we stepped foot in this place and i did not want to wait not a minute longer to be in my car and on my way home from a long day i even walked my check to the register to get the hell out of there 
so in full 
its poorly managed loud the restroom arrangement is ridiculous soggy buns and over priced under filled plates ohh i almost forgot my mother in law ordered the milk shake and it was more like a cup of ice cream that she ate with a spoon rather then a straw i even asked her how do you eat ice cream before dinner and i was corrected by her this is supposed to be a milk shake i never seen a milk shake in a rocks glass always in a tall shapely cola glass with whipped cream on top 
totally missed the mark on that one 
i also waited one whole day before i left this review as i dont usually review places but the girl at the check in was so rude i just had to voice my experience 
i will give them another shot not anytime soon but if that girl is still working there i will be the $$ that leaves to go to another place where you dont have to wait 3 hours for a soggy bun"}
{"text":"Great prickly pear margarita!  The Blanco Burger is to die for!  Great experience, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch and Amanda was working the Bar. She was so delightful, hospitable, and down right amazing. She went the extra mile to go check on our food to ensure we weren't waiting too long, drinks never hit half full, and she was so helpful with ordering and making great suggestions. Me and my husband will be back for sure due to her incredible talents of hospitality and kindness."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm! The beef they use on their burgers is delicious! The waitress was super nice and had a fantastic experience. I will definitely be back! Got the breakfast burger which fell apart and was wonderfully messy, just the way a good burger is supposed to be. Told my husband I would be taking him here because he hasn't found a good burger in town in a long time."}
{"text":"I had the Kobe burger plus the double truffle fries.

Both were just ok, specially taking in consideration the over price.

Nice spot, ok food.

Be ready to drop at least 20."}
{"text":"Met some girlfriends here Friday night around 6pm, though they arrived early to take advantage of a great happy hour (although my drink was ordered, and arrived before 6pm, I was somehow charged full price). 

They split 2 baskets of the sweet potato fries. I found them limp and bland, and didn't care for the dipping sauce (mayo-ish).

What was fantastic was the burger. I got the Zinburger, and it arrived literally 2 minutes later, perfectly cooked. It was flavorful, juicy, and just amazing. Now and again the onion flavor poked through, though I never really tasted the cheese. In the end, I didn't miss it--the burget was that great.

The restaurant was family friendly with tons of kids around. It is also pretty loud (as sparse, cement-y restaurants tend to be). The menu is miniscule, but that's ok. Just stop in for a quick, reasonably priced bite to eat."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a burger.  Service is great, selection is diverse.  I recommend coming during happy hour if you're a fan of fries...great deals.  I love the chicken sandwich and chopped wedge; great options."}
{"text":"Our first visit today and it did not disappoint. Yummy burgers and we tried zucchini fries...very, very good.  Be sure to give them a try instead of just fries.  We will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Love the one out at the biltmore! Glad they put one in gilbert! Service was fantastic! Kobe burger cooked to perfection and the truffled Parmesan fries are off the hook!"}
{"text":"I really want to give zinburger more stars but they are too inconsistent. Fries and onion rings are really hot and crispy some days and cold and soggy other days. And I always go during prime lunch or dinner hours so the heat lamps shouldn't be the reason. The main complaint is how they cook their patties. I asked for medium and the waitress said that was a little pink. When I got it it was dripping pink and the bun was soggy from how undercooked the meat was. The time after I asked for well done and it still had pink dripping! I'll ask for burnt next time and it should be perfect. I do love that they split the shakes for 2 for you, which are really good. Plus one star for that."}
{"text":"Best beef burger around! Killer chx Cesar salad! Zucchini sticks are yummy! Shakes are awesome! If you want a good burger  come here!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I've had a few of their burgers and I've always been a happy with them. Today I ordered the el Diablo burger and if was definitely spicy. I'm all for spicy but unfortunately that's all I could taste. They put so much of the chipotle mayo on it that it drowned out the flavor of everything else on it. That was a bummer. I really liked the loaded fries and my wife liked her turkey burger. I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"Best gourmet burger I have ever had.  I'm not going to even pretend my meal was not expensive though (it was my birthday night and it was a treat to myself).  A double Kobe burger with cheddar, bacon, lettuce and tomato, loaded fries and onion rings...$40.00 before tip.  That being said all items were amazing (especially the fries!).  This burger might possibility get you arrested for having a \"destructive device\" cos that mac daddy was \"da bomb\"!  
Moist, flavorful.  The flavors of the meat balanced beautifully with the smoky bacon and the sharp cheddar.  I'm salivating even now 12 hours later.
Dear Cow - I am sorry you died, however in death you became immortalized as a work of meat art.  You could just as easily ended up covered in Mickey D's sauce and took on the name of \"Quarter Pounder with Cheese\", but you were destined for immortality and will forever live on in my heart (and arteries) as my own little piece of heaven on earth with the title \"Zinburger\"."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. My husband had the Blanco burger and Zucchini fries.  I don't eat red meat.  So I had the Zucchini fries. Delicious!  Service was prompt and attentive.  The Biltmre is a great place to people watch. Doing it while enjoying delicious food is worthy of 5 stars. The food is expensive. You can expect to spend $30 per person for a burger, fries and non alcoholic drink plus tip. But you really will get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We were a group of 13 and they were not accommodating at all! We called ahead at 3 pm and were told to call back at 6 and they told us it would be a 3 hour wait. This makes no sense... we already waited 3 hours. We were told we could get a table at 7:30 so that's when we arrived and we ended up waiting until 9 to actually get a seat! We kept asking the hostess when we would be seated and she first said \"in 30 min\" 45 minutes later still nothing so we asked again \"15 minutes\" ridiculous. I wish they would've been honest and told us we would be standing waiting for 120 minutes, we would've saved our time and gone somewhere else. The food was decent but it wasn't worth the wait. I won't be coming here again unless someone else begs me to go."}
{"text":"I have to say that I enjoyed my burger.  I had the Blanco Burger and it was cooked perfectly and had the right amount of heat.  The loaded fries were very good but a little small for a two person portion. Not worth the price. The front of the house could use a little attention. We entered from the north side and were not greeted by the 3 servers at the front. It took a little surveying to figure out where the hostess station was so we could be seated.  We were seated at a high top and the stools are not comfortable and are very heavy to move.  Service was very slow. It is very unusual to receive my beer before my wife's water and the beers didn't arrive that quickly.   I have to agree with another reviewer that the servers dropping off the diners are a little robotic. Here is your dinner with no comments at all.  Not even an acknowledgement that I said \"Thank You\".  Our actual server was nice but made infrequent stops by our table. 

I like the burgers and the brightness of the dining room but the price does not support the level of service."}
{"text":"This burger craze in out of control... honestly.  Did I really just pay $30-some bucks for two burgers, zucchini and water?  $40-something with tip and tax...

I'm sorry, but NO BURGER is that good.  Don't get me wrong, their burgers WERE good.  Zucchini were soggy though.  Unfortunately the guilt was worse than the food was good.

I keep going to these darn burger spots hoping for a miracle which doesn't occur.

Know who makes good burgers...?  ME.  At home.  YOU COULD TOO.  

Get the butcher to grind some good chuck.  Buy a good fresh roll from the bakery and some cheese from the deli (all can be done a Albertson's, or AJ's).  Get a cast iron skillet smoking hot.  Salt and pepper each side.  Slap them on for two or three minutes each side.  DONE.  With a nice crust and all to the meat.  The \"crust\" is what I think is missing from the gourmet burgers I've had recently.

If you wanna get fancy grate some jalapenos and put them in mayo along with minced cilantro.

If I am going to spend $30 or more (on food only) it will be for something that I cannot easily make at home."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from a Pheonix local me and my coworker knew AND on a recommendation from our hotel shuttle driver. If it was recommended by two locals, it has to be good, right? It was! We had the kobe burgers that came with cheese and sauteed mushrooms. It was excellent, the burger was full of flavor and quite large. We also tried the creme brulee shake...delish! Also the zuchinni fries and the sweet potato fries are a must have. We ordered way too much food for the two of us to finish but it was well worth the visit...we left full and satisfied. I'd recommend this to other people visiting the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is so f$$$ing good. Been there twice and both times were great. 

I ordered take out today and got there and the bartender who took my order didn't get my order right. Says \"all I heard was one burger\", as though it's my fault he didn't get it right, but at the same time confirmed his poor listening skills. I know what I wanted and I asked for that. So my drive down there to get my two burgers wasn't great. While I was standing there He said he'd get the kitchen to do another one while I waited, and asked how I would like it cooked. I do not like pink ground beef so I always get it well done. He looks at me and says \"ooooh, that's gonna take long\", which I don't understand. Was he suggesting I get my order made a different way? Anyway, he talked me out front waiting around because his facial expression pissed me off and I paid and left. No apology, no thanks fo or anything from him. 

Suggestion to him: confirm the order before you hang up, be nice to the customers, apologize and smile. That's it. His attitude was that it was my fault. This was a Bad experience that I had to share. I will go back but, I'll remember this guy and the bad experience he helped me have. Cheers!

Follow up: despite this minor bad experience, one of the wonderful management staff-members at Zinburger took the time to write me and apologize. I thought that was amazing and really erased the less than great experience I had. I recommend anyone to go to this Zinburger and enjoy the food and atmosphere. It's great. Thanks Zinburger. Other companies should follow your example. I wasn't ignored. My 3 out of 5 stars is now 5/5 :)"}
{"text":"I love the ambience! Everyone here is so joyous and polite! Great place for a Friday night conversation with the significant other!"}
{"text":"I had a kobe burger....it was very good and so was the bun.....$5 for fries I thought was expensive.....basically two burgers, 3 beers and two orders of fries was $70 plus tip.  I doubt I'd go again......."}
{"text":"First time here tonight! I have my kids with me and I was worried about finding a kid friendly place here in the Scottsdale Quarter and I was relieved to walk in and see lots of families with their kids. Hallelujah!! And the food was great. My wife got the My Boy Blue and I went for the Ahi Sandwich! Loved it! Be sure to check it out! Oh. And get a shake, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Best veggie burger ever--It's the perfect spot to go if you are going with friends who want burgers and you are a vegetarian---"}
{"text":"Okay would have given more stars because their food is normally pretty good. Start to finish this experience was poor. Before I arrived other people in my party asked for a high chair for me. It wasn't there when I got there, I asked again. Then stood around for almost 10 minutes waiting while our server not only didn't bring one but instead brought a drink to the table. So I'm standing there with my baby, a diaper bag, and a toddler while she asks me what I want to drink? I ordered a chocolate milk for my son that took another 10 minutes to get to the table. Then they burned my sons food and tried to tell me that is how it's supposed to look. Then when they remade it they tried something different which still wasn't good and not edible. Meanwhile they still charged me for it. I had such a nice experience here the last time, just super disappointing this time around. Also we have paid and tipped and the table has not been cleared at all. We finished eating more than 15 minutes prior to this photo being taken.

Edited: the manager approached me as we were leaving and apologized as well as refunded my money for my sons meal."}
{"text":"Staff was very attentive. Great atmosphere. Got the veggie burger with the bunless option that swaps out the bun for a green salad. I also ordered sautéed mushrooms to add to my burger. 

The veggie patty itself was really tasty. However the sprouts on top were minimal. I got one sliver of avocado and two small slices of tomato. The salad was small and sad and wilted. It's like they scrounged through the bottom of the old salad bag to give the vegan girl whatever was left. 

Pretty lame vegan option. If you have an option stated on a menu as a vegan option that shouldn't mean that it has to also be super lame on all accounts. Right?!! $10 for a veggie patty and a wilted salad just doesn't cut it for me. I can go to FEZ and get an amazing black bean burger, bunless, with a huge amazing salad for about the same price. 

On a side not my wife ordered the same burger as I did with a bun and loved it. So, can we upgrade the bunless option here???

If you like fried food the zucchini fries are a fried food lover's dream come true

I will likely be getting my burgers elsewhere.... Like FEZ, which means I would rather drive 20 minutes to get a burger and some drinks than pop around the corner to Zin."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour. The margarita and Gin and Tonic #11 were both good. I was really expecting the burgers to be a little more unique. We tried the Popper and Zinburger. Both were pretty much the same kind of thing you'd get from Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers. Not bad but definitely not anything special. The loaded fries were good. If you go I recommend going for Happy Hour and get the HH burgers that are a little smaller but only $5 and a side. It's still plenty of food."}
{"text":"Love how flavorful and filling the burgers are! Usually when I eat a whole burger I feel bloated and tired, but after eating here I feel full and happy. This is my favorite burger restaurant and I will be a life long fan. The loaded fries are a must have!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place on Sunday. We had our 2 1/2 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry. We quickly ducked into Zinburger. All three of us had burgers. The kid's burger was huge and it came with fries. We also ordered the sweet potato fries. The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious. I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time I'll order those instead of fries. 

We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm. We told the waiter we were in a hurry. He was great, friendly and accommodating. We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there. Everyone was so nice. 

My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare. It still tasted yummy and I ate it. Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party here.  The manager was nice and helpful, and Cherise the waitress was great.  Could not be any happier."}
{"text":"Delish. The Zen burger is their signature and it's probably enough to keep them in business with out the rest. Looking at about 20 bucks for a burger, fries, and shake but it beats the heck out of comparable options like Shake Shack or Red Robin. Can't go wrong with a burger and fries, and it's a loose modern atmosphere that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Good Burgers and Friendly service. Truffle Fries were good. Milkshakes were good.  A bit pricey and make sure you order light sauce if you don't want your burger soggy. Quality of food was good and all tasted good.  Great potential!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar during a visit last week, and the bartender on duty was fantastic. He made sure to keep our iced teas replenished and was totally accommodating when I built a complicated veggie burger. And, oh, that veggie burger! I'd been wary of Zinburger for years as I've had repeated mediocre experiences at Sam Fox restaurants, but was made a convert when a friend had Zinburger cater her baby shower. 

I'm usually not a fan of burger buns, but the veggie burger bun is simultaneously substantial and light. The veggie patty also sets itself apart from so many other restaurants that seem content on doling out frozen Morningstar patties. Soft, fresh, and tasty, it's filling without leaving that heavy feeling in your tummy. 

Don't forget the sweet potato fries either! Hand-cut, crispy, and fresh, they pair well with the accompanying yogurt or with ketchup."}
{"text":"I live out of town and always make sure I stop in for a nice burger at Zinburger! Typically I go to the biltmore location but my family and I went to the Scottsdale quarter one recently. The staff is usually really nice but I went there the other day for lunch and had Emily as my server. She was sooo amazing! she took care of me and my family very well, offered suggestions, and made all the little things count that maybe other servers wouldn't have. Super simple stuff like asking if we wanted other types of dipping sauces with our fries... I know that seems weird but I really appreciated it! Overall, I will always love zinburger but I'm just happy to have had such great service at this location!"}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago. We go the loaded fries, and the original zinburger.
The fires were delicious, however because of their open building, they got cold rather quick and that kind of stunk =(
The zinburger tasted like they had just got the meat straight for the cow that day! It was soon fresh and delicious. My husband didn't really like the texture of the burger, but i think it had to do with the caramelized onions.
Over all, I would definartly go back!"}
{"text":"Zinburger has great tasting burgers, shakes and fries. I don't know how long ago they changed their menu, but they removed some of their specialty burgers--most notably a breakfast one that had bacon and a grilled egg. Even without those specialty burgers, they still have a solid selection, and if you want that grilled egg (like I did), you can build your own burger and recreate some of the burgers that they used to have. 

Any burger that you get here is cooked to order, and it's always juicy and filled with flavor. You can get different types of fries ranging from normal fries to double truffle fries (my personal favorite). On top of that they have a large selection of shakes-- my favorite being the Nutella crunch! 

The atmosphere here is loud and pretty busy. Unless you reserve a table, you're most likely going to have a wait during dinner time. They have some indoor seating, a full bar, and more seats outdoor as well. 

If you're looking for a good tasting burger, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Zinburger has ruined burgers for me... Because they're so delicious here that I can't find another restaurant that compares. I always get the Samburger but my husband has tried a few different ones and they've always been really good. The kids' meals are cheap - $5 - can't beat that. The truffle fries & green chili fries are amazing and so are the onion rings. I highly recommend the onion rings with ranch dressing. So good. 

Cool atmosphere, fun bar area with windows that rolls all the way up when it isn't brutally hot outside, and really friendly staff! I've seen dogs in the outside bar area, too, which scores major points by me. 

My only issue is that the bathroom is outside, small, and there is no baby changing area."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Phoenix to just chill, have a nice drink, some great apps, and amazing burgers."}
{"text":"REALLY good burger and milkshake! Cold beer with great service at the bar!!!  So glad they are in the Quarter now!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this location. The food has been amazing before but I have been waiting more than 35 minutes for my meal and no one has been by to refill my water or tell me when my meal will be out."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Their burgers are always amazingly fresh and tasty.  Normally I always have great customer service, but this last time the server seemed too busy doing her closing duties as opposed to bringing our food out on time.  It was a bit on the cold side...disappointing, but still good! Would give it a 5 star, but this last time really bummed me out.  Hopefully next time I get warmer food!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this location at Scottsdale Quarter, cause they have a cute patio in this outdoor mall that is super pretty! I am limited on what I can have here, since I don't eat meat; however, they have a super tasty veggie burger. I love their aioli French fries too!! I'm always tempted to order a shake, since they look amazing but haven't had one just yet. This place is busy during lunchtime hours, but they usually get you seated fairly quickly. Definitely come check it out, since they have tasty food & great service!"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it! I got the samburger. It was ridiculously good! Bacon and 1000 island
Our server, Danielle, was the sweetest ever- super fast, so nice and great at recommending things. She was extremely cautious about my wheat issue.  Im not celiac, but have a wheat allergy. They have GF buns that are actually delicious! She made sure to offer that my fries were fried in the oil that only GF foods were fried in. Love her! My mom got the Asian chicken salad and it was great. My hubby had the el Diablo burger and it was SO good. Quite spicy.
Saturday night at 7 and we only waited 18 mins for a table. I also love red wine and they had a great offering of wine, so the entire dinner was a great experience. Thanks Danielle for the great experience and thank you Zinburger"}
{"text":"ate the turkey burger for the first time....amazing!!!!!! best i ever had ;)"}
{"text":"No wait, friendly staff, nice open area establishment. The Wagyu burger is the best and made with American Kobe. The sides are large enough to share. Truffle fries are also amazing! Free refills on the delicious strawberry lemonade was also a plus."}
{"text":"Tasty stuff, butvreally heavy on salt and fats. You should see the calorie couts listed in the My Fitness Pal app for the signature dishes here. If you eat nothing else that day. you're still way over the daily recommendations."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! truffle fries. yummy burgers and shakes."}
{"text":"Super great burgers for a reasonable price. I kept bugging the waiter & he was still very kind. Food was great staff was great and it was fast service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first visit to Zinburger, any location, but I'd speculate this will be my favorite spot. Waited about 10 minutes for a seat on the covered patio on a busy Friday. While the weather is getting warmer now, the sun was receding slowly and the covering did the job of keeping us comfortable as we waited for our drinks and food. 

Service was quite good, our server was cheerful and fun, ready with a smile. As it was Happy Hour we had a few drinks and took advantage of the Happy Hour prices on the Zinburger and Chicken burger. An order of zucchini fries completed the scenario perfectly. Good stuff. I'll be returning for sure. The interior of the restaurant looks pretty comfortable as well, but for me the patio is the place to be for ambiance, people-watching and just relaxing with friends. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Much more convenient to get to than Ingo's.  Their pricing has started to climb up steadily, but you can still get a decent dinner under $20.  Service has been quite good every time I've been here too, besides one instance of the bar tender letting my to-go order sit forever at the kitchen window.

Parking Tip: I recommend the free parking garage behind Saks/Macy's, but they do validate the Camelback-facing front lot parking here too.

The breakfast burger is my go-to here.  The runny egg yolk is really what makes it, especially when a perfect bite encompassing sweet bun, medium burger, crunchy bacon, and gooey cheese is dipped in ketchup.  I did NOT like their veggie burger, it was extremely \"chunky\" and the texture was just all wrong.  I think I've tried their turkey burger once but I cannot remember it honestly.

The creme brûlée shake wasn't on the menu when I last visited, but it's really good.  The little \"crunches\" on top are the best.  Chocolate Mint and Cookies & Cream are also both excellent.

Their fries are good too, but I usually just get a burger and sometimes a milkshake."}
{"text":"It was ok. The burgers were prepared perfect. The combinations were not well balanced. Zinburger-couldn't taste manchego because of onion combination.  Brooklyn burger- tomato marmalade killed it. Blue cheese burger- super strong blue cheese.  Ringer burger-franks flavored. Vegie burger was just ok.  The fries were great.  The place has a ton of flys , a little annoying."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious. We got the Zinburger, the Diablo burger, and a plain and simple burger. The fries are also delicious, good service."}
{"text":"Best hamburger in town!!!! So many different options my fav is Kobe beef and triple chocolate milkshake its like been in haven!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Zin Burger is the handsome men who work on Tuesday night and the hostess.  The food is boring.  The zucchini fries were limp and looked like clam strips. The burger, although cooked perfect, was served  on a large and lonely white oval diner plate with 2 pickle slices. The bar tender must have been afraid of me as he stood 4 feet away and only spoke in very short and broken sentences. Fox restaurants leave a lot to be desired, generally."}
{"text":"The Zinburger was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten   I usually like a lot of stuff on my burger, but this didn't need anything more than the cheese, zin grilled onions, and some lettuce.  Just perfect. 

Overall, the place was very nice, but pricey.  For the price of the burgers, they should include a serving of fries, but you have to order those separately.  Their fries say they serve 2, but that is a stretch.  Two sensible servings perhaps, but if you are eating a burger, who's being sensible?

I would go back, and I would recommend this to friends, but only because the burger was THAT good."}
{"text":"3 star if that! nice area to eat but the burgers do need more seasoning. Juicy but with no flavor. Had the Bruce Lee not impressed!. Good presentation do. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Had the sloppy Joe and green chili fries. Both very very good. Been craving the sloppy joe every day since. They also have Deshuetes Fresh Squeezed IPA on draft. Winner Winner Burger Dinner"}
{"text":"The reason for the 2 stars instead of one is I gave Zin a second try after receiving a hamburger that wasn't even warm in the middle on my first visit.   

If you wan't a good hamburger don't go here. There are many many places that have better burgers and fries.  But if you want a good shake and zucchini fries it is an ok place for a snack.  The burgers are boring with little flavor and over priced."}
{"text":"So, the reason I am giving Zinburger in Gilbert a 3 is because I have been going there for almost 2 years with nothing but great service and amazing food. Regretfully I have never reviewed them on yelp for the great experiences I have had.  Tonight....was a bit different. If there was a 0....that is what I would give.  I tried to venture out on the menu and ordered the Blanco Burger. I asked to upgrade to the Kobe beef and was told to order the grass fed and that it was the same thing. How completely wrong they were. They patty was mediocre in size, over cooked and very under seasoned. When I am paying 17$ for a burger, please kitchen staff,learn how to properly prepare a burger cooked to order, and also consider seasoning it. My diet restricts me from eating bread, so lettuce wrapped is how it came out and honestly, looked nothing less than miserable . Lack of guacamole and scarce pico were the icing on this tasteless,disastrous cake. I wish I would have taken a picture to show the quality and quantity of the the 17$ burger we paid for. Maybe next time....."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch. Got seated right away even though it was Noon on a Saturday. Our hostess Kenzie was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. I got the chopped wedge salad with chicken and my dining companions had burgers. We all enjoyed a side of fries. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love that I can eat a burger smothered in goat cheese while listening to my favorite Spoon album and other music you don't often hear out. The atmosphere is modern and fun although the paintings of adorable black and white cows on the walls offer no reassurance when you're sinking your teeth into red meat ... just saying. The service is good our waitress was great and very accommodating. One of the other servers was barely covered by her why-am-I-wearing-these-in-winter-tiny-white-shorts which I thought was out of place and icky in a food service environment. The burgers were great, the fries were OK but the milkshakes were definitely the highlight of the evening."}
{"text":"Yum! Tried Zinburger with some friends a while back because of a) It's old town Gilbert location and b) the reviews! We were not disappointed. The burgers are gourmet and VERY good! They have a custom-build option which is always handy for myself as a picky eater. Their milkshakes are great too! It's normally busy here, so arrive early!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries!  Spicy green chili fries are a must have.   Onion rings were also good.  My Boy Blue and Samburger are our favorites.  Good service, nice atmosphere. 

Definitely our favorite place for a burger!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely amazing.  The zucchini fries were the best fries I've ever had. I almost wish the portion was smaller so I wouldn't so many!   The farm salad was excellent and provided a healthy balance for the fries.  Kids were happy and got milkshakes. We had a taste and they were sinful.  My husband, a veggie burger aficionado, thought the veggie burger was good. 

Only complaint is that it took 20 minutes to get seated when we could see many open tables."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio, delicious food, friendly and attentive staff - but very overpriced. It was $60 (pre-tip) for two burgers, fries and shakes."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger and fries that we've ever had! We were starving when we came here and Zin Burger definitely delivered! We shared their loaded, truffle, and green chile fries with another couple and each one was incredible! Our favorite was the green Chile and loaded fries because their queso sauce is amazing. Then our server told us about their burger of the week, the Chuck Norris burger, which has won awards. It has Kobe beef, onion rings, applewood smoked bacon, ranch coleslaw, some incredible cheese, mayo, and barbeque sauce. We had to get it and were so glad that we did....this burger was amazing!!! We loved every single thing about this place and cannot wait to go back! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is quite decent. I ordered the Farm salad in small size (only $5) and it was really good. My friend got a build his own burger with only $11.5 and it turned out really good. The server is definitely friendly, and the environment is great. The whole idea of \"concept kitchen\" is pretty cool."}
{"text":"This place is a trendy and hip gourmet burger joint. A carbon copy of the trendy and hip gourmet burger joints on the streets of LA and OC. Ahhhh it felt like home! (Can you tell I still miss SoCal?)

But I digress, let's get to the basic facts of this place. It's not bombtastic by any means but it's pretty darn good. I am usually the type of girl who prefers throwing down with a hearty In N Out or Five Guys burger BUT I do appreciate the fancy stuff every now and then...burgers included.

So if you're down with that then give this place a try. They have some great burger combinations on the menu plus you can add on other goodies like a fried egg. Yum! I also tried the ahi sandwich and was pretty pleased. I mean, I finished the whole darn thing so I can only assume that I enjoyed it. 

Our table taste tested the zuchini fries, truffle fries and sweet potato fries. All winners but my favorite were the truffle fries. I'd go back just for those papas fritas.

Service was good. No problems at all...even when I requested to change tables simply because I changed my mind and preferred a booth. Food came out quickly and the atmosphere is young and trendy. Not a bad thing if you ask me."}
{"text":"This is a happening place on a Thursday night. We sat at the bar because of the long wait. The servers were very kind, but too busy to be very responsive (e.g., they forgot to bring a drink). The ambiance was nice--like a hip bar.

The hamburgers were really good. I had the vegetarian burger and found it filling and flavorful. We also ordered fries and requested they add garlic. The fries were good, but we could barely taste the garlic. 

I would not go again. The food was good, but not good enough to fight the crowds. There are plenty of other burger joints in the area I would want to experience first. For ambiance, though, this place definitely has a good vibe. It would be a great place to meet friends after work."}
{"text":"What is the deal here? A basic burger and fries, it was fine, not great. But based on their hype, it needs to be MUCH better. Or cheaper. Or whatever... get over it."}
{"text":"I'm happy to report these cows gave their best for me to eat. Thank you dear moo cows thank you! These burgers are meaty goodness. Recently I went to a lunch with my bf, her sis and Ma on the fly for her b/day since her first choice failed to be open on a Sunday afternoon..... Not her fault their site said they would be open. Bastards shaking my fist in the air didn't update the site. 
D O U B L E Grrrrr! I suggested Zin since we were in the proximity. 
So this is my 3rd time at this place. While pricey the portions of everything are large in charge & good. The ingredients are fresh, the meat juicy and the fries are crispy as they should be in my opinion. Note to your mother! Do not waste the fat & gym time on the creme brulee shake. It's nothing more then a fancy name on a regular old vanilla shake. Having said that... I am a creme brulee fan so that may have been it's downfall. I was expecting greatness and fireworks etc. I got a really good vanilla shake though don't get me wrong but name it a vanilla shake. Don't market it as a creme brulee shake. How to improve it and bring a tear to my eye? Put a creme brulee hat on it. Gimmie the crunchy, sweet I'm looking for expect and demand. Just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake. The best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone on-line and having them show up and it's clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile. It is some one with a great personality and decent looks for sure just not the hottie. Still had a good time but my expectations were something else totally. The banana cream pie shake is de-lish and the Zin burger a def go. If you want a healthy choice go for the Tuna also very good and served perfectly rare. Mmmmm mmmm good."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place...its fun and hip and cool...lol...there are some very creative burger combonations and they are good...my favorite part of their menu is the truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and shoe string fries...and of course their shakes OMG!!!! The banana foster shake is something out of this world it is definitely worth going there for that...i would choose some places burgers over here but i really like it!! I like to meet up here with friends and family for a fun little night out...they do have a good wine selection as well..."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great burger!  Good value too!

This is a fun restaurant featuring many burgers and a full bar. They have some veggie burgers and chicken burgers, as well as Kobe beef burgers. 

The salads are huge, the burgers are good portions and. Everything is al la carte, so order a salad, burger and fries with an ice cold beer. 

The Kobe burger was excellent. The ranch dressing is home made and is awesome on the salad and the burger. Many toppings for your burger and many options, even build your own!

Great food, fun place, and sit at the bar and talk to the bartender Daniella!"}
{"text":"Having been spoiled to the ways of the Zinburger at the Biltmore, I was really let down by my experience in the Gilbert location. Customer service is missing the mark, the food was good, but not \"this is the best burger ever\" like I rely on Zinburger for. Also, an hour wait on a weeknight? Welcome to Gilbert, minivan/Suburban central, I guess."}
{"text":"Two stopped here for a bite after most shops closed on a Sunday. With as high-end of an area that The Quarter is, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the prices are quite reasonable. A lovely area!

We were lured in by the amazing aroma of the burgers. Upon arrival the place was nearly at capacity but a place was found for us promptly. 

We opted to share a Zinburger and truffle fries. VERY pleased! The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavor was a flawless marriage of the beef, onions, and cheese. The truffle fries were no less than addicting. Service was terrific, prompt, friendly, and spot-on despite being a full restaurant. Oh yeah, we will definitely return for this undeniable goodness! A seriously good value in a seriously glamorous area."}
{"text":"Great place. Stopped by for a drink and appetizers while I was waiting on my daughter's rehearsal to wrap up. I was immediately greeted and seated at the bar. The staff was AWESOME and friendly. They made sure I was comfortable and checked on me frequently. The food I ordered was great and my wine was ever greater. I will definitely be back and will probably become a regular. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good food, better service.  Should you visit, try the grass fed beef and ask for Kira.....full of life personality.  We were well taken care of."}
{"text":"We called at 4pm and got a 7:15pm reservation for 12 yesterday.  We came in after completing the Phoenix Summit Challenge - hiking 7 summits in Phx, in 1 day.  We started hiking at 5am and finished at 6pm, and went straight there from the last mtn- dusty, dirty, smelly, and HUNGRY!  We were seated right away, ordered drinks and food, and taken care of like we were in formal wear (def NOT the case...).  I love the burgers here, and talked our group into going here - I knew all day I wanted the best burger in town.  Once we'd all eaten, it was decided we'll come here every year after this event.  Everyone loved their food and our server was fantastic!  Thanks, and keep it up!"}
{"text":"First, come hungry because the burgers are big. Husband ordered the El Diablo; I had the Zin.  Both were good, made with fresh ingredients down to the burger ground on site. Second, be prepared to get your hands a little messy...the burgers are juicy. Third, fries are optional,  literally. The burger itself will fill you up, so take that into consideration if you just have to have fries. We had the Truffle Fries. They were the only thing I wasn't impressed with (they lacked flavor or a little salt, something), but we still brought them home. Parking at the Scottsdale location is a challenge but not too bad.  Overall good experience, food, and wait staff."}
{"text":"So happy we went here for lunch. I'm not a burger fan, but I am a Fox restaurant fan, so I may be a little biased... But this was the best burger I've ever had! I just had the zinburger and it was delicious. We also had the truffle fries and they were to DIE for... So amazing. For a drink, I ordered the raspberry acai margarita and it was so flavorful and mouthwatering.. Oh my goodness. I definitely recommend this place! Service was great too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try one of the famous burgers here. But by the time I got around to it, the time was 7:00 pm. This wouldn't normally be an issue for me, but I'm on east coast time. So internally, it was 10:00 pm and my appetite had shut down for the day. It's as if it said: \"Okay fine. If you haven't eaten by now I suppose you don't plan to. Then sleep. And feed me extra in the morning, Seymour.\" 

But I was seated at the bar/counter dining area so I decided to order a chicken salad. It was actually quite good and just enough if you're in the mood for something light. Service was also very good. The kind gentleman at the bar was extremely attentive and managed it all alone while dealing with about a dozen customers. 

And about that famous burger...while I didn't get to try one on this trip, the gentleman seated next to me ordered one and it looked pretty amazing to me. Big patty with a ton of bacon and whatever else he ordered. I wanted to snap a picture of his meal but thought better of it. 

Next time, I'm getting here earlier so I can manage one of those..."}
{"text":"Only been here twice in my life and the second time it was because a friend wanted to have lunch here.  So I was like, \"Fine.\"

You can tell how enthused I am about this place.  Their burgers aren't bad, they're just burgers to me.  There isn't anything about the taste of their burgers that is distinctive and sets them apart.  When I was here recently, I decided to go the healthy route and try their turkey sloppy joe.   It wasn't that tight.  And it's not because my taste buds would have rather been slathered with a bbq bacon burger, but it just was not good.  I sat there and poked at it miserably .

I will say this though - their shakes are balling.  The banana foster shake with a couple shots of Kahlua .... oooooh shiet.."}
{"text":"Decent burgers and sides with high-quality ingredients. The Turkey Sloppy Joe changed my mind about 1) turkey burgers and 2) sloppy joes. Service is good, usually, too. I recommend their sangria, but if you're celebrating anything, split a milkshake or cream pie."}
{"text":"The burgers at here were ok but not cooked as ordered, my zinburger ordered medium had absolutely no pink, and my hubby's medium was definitely medium rare-- he took half home and microwaved til done. The fries and onion rings were  soggy. And my berry cocktail was bitter! 
 Then after we began eating, a large table of 5 adults 2little boys and a baby were seated next to us. The adults sat together and they sat their extremely hyperactive kids together and even the baby at the very end  next to our table.     Thanks!!  
One of the little boys was really misbehaving, running up and down the aisles between our tables from the get- go, fork fighting, dropping things under OUR table, etc. while his parents sat oblivious to the disruptions, enjoying each others company .   It made our mediocre dining experience ultimately worse!
Our waiter was inattentive as well.
 Although the menus seemed similar, we thought the burgers, fries, and service were much better during our visit to Hopdoddy a few days earlier!!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what it is.  Fries don't even come with your burger.  And they were crazy expensive.  The waitress was terrible.  I asked her to split the check way ahead of time and we barely saw her at all.  Pretentious burger joint. Save your money and go across the street to joes!"}
{"text":"Our experience did not start well, but the manager and entire staff worked at making it better until the very end. My husband had the breakfast burger, I had the No Bun, with GF beef so so yummy, and although it wasn't a good start we were treated with respect and hospitality. We will be back"}
{"text":"Zinburger what can I say. First time and they got it right!!! Burgers are phenomenal. My husband and I had the wagyu (American Kobe) and the classic diner burger where you can choose a single or double it up with a shared side of loaded fries. Riesling was great (better by the bottle). A new comer, that Zinburger graciously gave my husband for free, Italian limeade. Wonderful!!!! Hints of spring time and basil. This is a must try place!!!!  
Zinburger rocked!!!!"}
{"text":"The food quality and service @ the Phoenix location is far more superior than the  food quality and service at this Gilbert location. Hope they can get it together!!!"}
{"text":"I think ZinBurger is absolutely fantastic! I have been there twice. Once on a Monday night and then again on a Sunday night.

The hostesses are very helpful and polite. They let you know exactly what is going on with tables and get you seated as soon as possible.

Both waiters I had were pretty good. One was extremely helpful and accommodating. The other was just okay, not bad, but nothing to write home about. 

Let's get to the food! OMG the burgers are amazing! I have had the Kobe burger and the Zin burger. I thought both were equally good. I could not tell much of a difference between them. Zinburger actually cooks a burger medium if you ask them to! Sometimes it seems some places ask you your preference and still cook it well done. Not Zinburger. 

I had the handcut fries which were pretty good. Have not had a chance to try any of the others.

The Double Chocolate Mint Shake is to die for!

Best burger I have had in awhile! Will be going back asap!"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here with hubby and kids.

First time was with girlfriends for ladies night out.  None of us have been there before but wanted to taste the food, see if the reviews are right.  The food was delish!
We sat by the corner booth.  Got seated right away.  Waiter came and took our drink orders right away.  

Highly recommend:

Zuchini fries - we all couldn't have enough.  We ordered another plate.  It was crunchy, you can taste the zuchini.  great substitute for fries.  (if you have to order fries, go with this one.  skip the sweet potato fries - they were good but the zuchini fries are better, and pass on the truffle oil fries - you can taste the truffle oil and they were good but boy, the zuchini fries surpasses them all!

Bananas Foster shake - it was dessert in a drink.  You can taste the bananas and the caramel.  Consistency was perfect.  Yum!  My girlfriend had a taste and took one to go, after we already had dinner there.  

Had the regular zinburger and it was perfect!  Ordered medium well and it was slightly pink in the middle but that's ok becuase I've been warned by the other reviewers.  Thick patty was still juicy and moist, great seasoning, simple lettuce, tomato.  The burger was tasty.  I could only finish half  because I wanted the shake more.  

I didn't have room for dessert but GFs said the choco cake was heavenly!  I'll have to come back and try it another time.

Service was quick.  We got our food right away.  Waiter was attentive and helpful (he recommended the bananas foster shake over the tiramisu)

Overall: yes the $10 pricetag on a burger without fries seems steep, but you're at the Biltmore, what do you expect.  It was good burger and the patty is like 2 inches thick.  Definite thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best burgers I've had in Phoenix. Have tried both the regular and Kobe burger, and honestly, there's no need to upgrade. Their regular burger is delicious. I wish there was one on the west side of town, but sometimes, the 40 minute drive is worth it. 

Service is usually very good, though the hostess/server outfits are an odd match for the trendy interior. 

To top off a great burger, have a shake. They are amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered Bruce Lee Burger. Delicious. We got sat down quick. Our order was taken quick as well. But our food took 30 minuets to come out. Way too long. But the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Poor slacky service, slooow slacky service and the only reason why I came here in the first place was because of the family.  
I've visited this place multiple times and the service always disappoints. 
The food however is good. Not great, but just good. 
Sam Fox needs to crack the whip and up his game on employee training.  He's getting his ass buried by hungrier competitors.... such as cold beer and cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"Want a pretty dang good burger?  Try one of the dozens available at Zinburger.  Excellent food and pretty dang good service meld together for a wonderful place to eat.  I always enjoy my visits here."}
{"text":"\"So I'm guessing truffles are kinda like tomatoes?\"

\"No, boyfriend. It's a kind of mushroom\"

Even after waiting in line for 15mins (gets packed here cos all the office people come out) We couldn't decide between the truffle fries, sweet potato fries or the zucchini straws so we got all of them. Our piggy asses stuffed each light, crispy and bursting with flavor chip into our holes dipping in all the different sauces waiting for our meaty burgers. All of which have their own distinct smell and all are just as good. I say everyone picks a side - and share.

Needless to say - $16ish for a burger is a lot of money. I got the kobe one with mushrooms and swiss, while boyfriendy got the normal cheeseburger. While both the burgers were grilled to our desires (mine, medium rare that's cool and pink in the middle and boyfriendy's medium well's brown) I'm pretty sure we could get the same effect with Costco's burger patties and my Dad's cooking skills.

We missed out on the dessert because we were just stuffed from the burger and fries - they messed up on an order of salad and charged us for a cheaper one (should have been free!) and we sat outside by the mist-ti-fiers before heading out to Paradise cookie.

Overall - good location, they validate your parking, kinda-sexpensive and not overall healthy. BUT - a gourmet burger joint is a gourmet burger joint and not one to miss if you're in the area."}
{"text":"They went above and WAY beyond to make me happy.  If a restaurant doesn't have Coke, which they don't, I always get Mountain Dew. When I found out they don't have that either,  I told our waitress how much that sucks.  The manager took it upon himself and went across the street to another restaurant to get me my Dew, and enough for all the refills.  That's true customer service,  which is hard to come by anymore.  I really appreciated that gesture.  But seriously, they should get Coke or at the very least Mtn. Dew. 

Oh. And the burger was awesome."}
{"text":"In the mood for something different, my husband and I checked out Zinburger this Sunday afternoon for an early dinner. After figuring out the Biltmore's token parking situation, we wanted to take the opportunity to enjoy \"Phoenix winter\" out on the patio. The hostess station was a bit chaotic, especially given that the restaurant wasn't very busy, but after a few minutes, we were seated at a two-top on the patio that turned out to be a fantastic spot to people-watch. 

I was excited to try the My Boy Blue, a burger topped with caramelized onions and rich blue cheese. The flavors and texture were spectacular, but the gluten-free bun (while delicious) wasn't able to withstand the sauciness of this particular burger and began to dissolve in my hands. I gave up and ate the last third with a knife and fork, wishing I had stashed a wet nap or something in my purse to address the mayo situation. My husband had the special of the day, a triple-decker that the waiter described as a Big Mac, \"but better.\" The gf bun held up much better on his burger - then again he also has much bigger hands :) We split a basket of fries, prepared in the dedicated gf fryer, which were pleasantly crisp. 

I was a little disappointed to see such cheap liquors in their signature cocktails (Smirnoff? Whaaaa?) and ordered the blood orange lemon drop (with Ketel One) with my meal. I'm always worried that the bartender is going to make a \"girly\" drink too sweet, but I was pleasantly surprised by the balanced flavor and decent buzz found in this $8 cocktail. My husband doesn't share my aversion to sweets, and indulged in a root beer float, served in a huge glass for $6. Their rich vanilla ice cream made this float a decadent treat. 

Two drinks, two gf burgers, and a large fry came out to $48 before tip. Not cheap, but for the quality of beef and refreshing gluten-free selections, I'm sure we'll be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"The turkey sloppy joe burger was unbelievable. Their fries aren't the best in town but I couldn't stop eating them. Every burger I saw pass in front of me looked amazing... I wanted to eat all of them while I was there. 

The wait staff is young and pretty, fun to look at unless you're on a date. Then, good luck to you, sir. This place is owned by the same company that runs True Foods. Need I say more? Both places are awesome in their own way."}
{"text":"Our family enjoys Zinburger. I love their zucchini fries. Also, their Diet Dr. Pepper is really good. I know you would think there should be no differences in fountain drinks, but there is!"}
{"text":"Burger was okay but certainly not worth the price I paid and it did not even include a drink or a side. Disappoint to say the least. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Awwwww.... Excellent cuisine! Our party of four enjoyed different burgers that were all sooo tasty! Their truffle French fries were decadent! We will surely return!"}
{"text":"I believe Public Enemy said it best ... \"Don't believe the hype it's a sequel!\"

I am a big fan of the idea of transforming simple food into an extraordinary experience. So, as you can imagine, I came here for lunch mid-week expecting burger decathalon greatness. Unfortunately, I came away feeling like I just won a participation meh-dal. 

I ordered the Samburger - applewood smoked bacon, american cheese, 1000 island ressing, medium. The burger was good, and it was cooked to specification, but it wasn't fist-pumping, smoke-the-tires-off-the-Camaro-at-the-Dairy Queen awesome. (Bear with me ... this is the drivel you get when you fall asleep on the couch and the 120 Minutes drifts into a Bon Jovi VH-1 marathon. Damn it, I am just a vessel!) 

I ordered the sweet potato fries (which are sold separately from the burger ... yep that's the sound of another Abe Lincoln being kicked out of your wallet's precious orbit ...). They were a major disappointment. Between the sins of blandness and sloth, I will take sloth for $500, Alex.

Where Zinburger shines is the Creme Brulee shake. Get it. Down it. Then get into your Bon Jovi edition Camaro and go into a gut heavy coma in the 120 degree heat. Even without the Camaro, it's that awesome.

Service was okay, but all in all, Zinburger is over-priced and underwhelming. If going to Zinburger is a requirement to get your last Cub Scout badge then get your caloric splurge on one of their shakes and go to town. Otherwise, save your money."}
{"text":"Always good, don't just stick to burgers. The chicken sandwich and turkey sloppy joe are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Eating here makes me mad that its nowhere near me. I loved it ALL. I tried their burger of the month... A Kobe patty onion and bacon relish port salut cheese truffle aioli and lettuce MMMM, MMMMM! Of course I got both the truffle fries and sweet potato. Our table shared the house salad which was tasty. My favorite thing was the salted caramel shake. People of Arizona, I envy you for having this restaurant in your backyard."}
{"text":"Fox Restaurant Concepts is usually on the ball with their restaurants(such as Green House, North, etc.). Zin Burger is ok, but not really anything really special. 

I went to this restaurant with my mum for a Memorial Day lunch (not a particulary special occasion). We were seated very quickly, and the server was very attentive, though his knowledge of wine was a bit under par. One of the main defects of the menu is the lack of \"origins\" for the various wines on offer. As someone who is particular about his California wines, this is not good. The Lemon Zipper cocktail (which my mum ordered) was quite tasty, and she likened it to a Mojito without the rum. 

I ordered the SamBurger, substitute cheddar for American Cheese, and mum ordered a basic burger with avocado added. We both opted for medium well done, and really, it seemed more like \"well done\" to me. The burgers were meh. Ok, but not special. DeLux Burger this place isn't. We also ordered the sweet potato fries which were tasty. 

So, overall grade is a C, with the following breakdown
Service - D (downgraded from C-; this place is called ZinBurger, 
                      a server with under par knowledge of wines is not good)Food -     C+
Drinks -  C+

For a better burger, I recommend DeLux Burger on 32nd Street and Camelback."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my third visit to Zinburger and I must say it was fantastic! I choose to try one of the Ultimate Burger Challenge burgers, the Hen House. Angus beef with a fried egg, avocado, bacon, pickled onion, tomato, lettuce, and mayo all on their perfectly made bun. It was a sloppy mess because of all the topping but what do you expect with that many toppings. The burger came with a half order of fries which I choose the sweet potato fries. At $10 the burger is a steal compared to normal menu pricing. With that many toppings it would've been a $15+ burger. My wife had the Hava Chicken Sandwich which has become her new favorite food! And we split the Zucchini Fries, WOW those things are amazing! Overall everything was fresh and tasted wonderful. Make sure to finish it off with a shake. We split the KitKat Shake, I'm not sure who makes the shakes there but they are a true professional! Perfectly blended and topped with whip cream. It was nothing short of amazing! Service was good, better than whats found in most burger joints but not quite to the scale of other FOX restaurants. But that type of service isn't necessary here, I'm having a burger not a complex pasta, and I'm having a milkshake not a glass of perfectly balanced Cabernet. Anyway All around great things at the Zinburger. Next I'll have to try a salad, maybe..."}
{"text":"I have visited Zinburger twice in the past month.  I can't tell you how refreshing the GF options are.  They even have a separate fryer to ensure french fries can be gluten free.  Nice touch!  

Regarding the atmosphere, it is definitely a fun and trendy place.  The tables are comfortable and the patio is nice.  There are seats at the corners of the bar that are odd and uncomfortable.  I ended up staring at a large metal post all night.  It would be a waste of space without a bar stool there but it is really shallow for food placement and very removed from the fun scene.  

Staff: Everyone is great, very nice, and work well as a team.  Nobody made a face or complaint when we asked for a side of something from the food runner or asked another server for side plates.  That says a lot about the team work.

Food, AWESOME.  We started with the farm salad both times, I can't say enough about that salad.  It really is just fresh and delicious.  The burger was fabulous, great flavors.  Kudos to the chef that toasted the GF bun.  So many restaurants just throw the bun on the burger which doesn't bode well if you have ever had GF bread.  We had the Grass Fed burger and it was great.  We were talked into the spicy green chili fries once and I was not a fan.  I like spicy food, but the sauce on there was just too hot to enjoy for me.  I had the sweet potato fries another time and enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Although our waitress was clearly on something, kept messing things up, slow, and would disappear for large amounts of time, I am rating this place at 5 because of their food! Every time we have been, the food is consistently great. I love their turkey Burger and zucchini fries. Their shakes are awesome too. It's a fun casual place to go and get great food."}
{"text":"The fresh bread and meat made for a hamburger that was absolutely delicious and then, I ordered the banana split milkshake!  OMG--it was positively the very best milkshake I've ever had!  All this and amazingly friendly and efficient servers, too! Jamie would be the perfect person for all wait staff to learn from. She even shared with us about how much she loves the company who owns Zinburger--now, I have one wish---I want a Zinburger near me!! It will be my go to restaurant whenever I'm in the Scottsdale area, for sure!"}
{"text":"This restaurant falls in line with Fez Burger. Both good burger places but not STELLAR. I have eaten here about 6 to 7 times because I work across the street and when you work with a bunch of guys a burger joint comes up a lot on the \"where should we go to lunch\" question.  I like the way the restaurant is set up, with open air concept and the large cow pasture mural on the wall. It takes me back to my Midwest days.

But the burgers here are just eh, they have good flavor but to me a true burger enthusiast should want a simple burger and not have tons and tons of toppings or options and I find almost every burger place now-a-days does this. I guess I just miss that simple part about the Midwest.  By no means are their burgers awful its just my personal preference...

I do however enjoy the double truffle fries! They are dynamite! 

If I had to pick between this place and FEZ I would go with this Zinburger hands down."}
{"text":"When my friend comes to visit me, we LOVE going to Happy Hour because we can get good food at a cheap price.

I was craving a burger so we decided to try Zinburger out. Their happy hour goes until 6pm (I think) where wine is $2!!! and appetizers are half off. Unfortunately none of their speciality burgers are on the happy hour menu. :( They do have a regular burger on their HH menu though. 

Their sweet potato fries & Truffle Fries were really delicious. I wasn't a fan of their dipping sauces..... I guess I'm just a ketchup-kind-of-gal. I ordered a Creme Brulee shake (which can definitely be shared since it's a lot) which is basically vanilla bean ice cream and a crust mixed in. It was so yummy. (But again, this wasn't available for their HH menu either )

It was a little chilly when we went, but they have an outside patio which would be great on a warm night."}
{"text":"My family has been to Zinburger a few times in the past months. We first went for a weekend brunch but ended up visiting again multiple times during happy hour (HH) since the HH menu is super affordable and the food is delicious! I'm a big fan of the Bruce Lee, the Zinburger and the Chicken Sandwich (delicious!) as well as the zucchini fries. The kiddos like sharing the chocolate shake, which is smooth, creamy and very rich. Service is good and the location is excellent, cleanliness is also top notch. Worth a visit! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We've been to Zinburger numerous times and I thought I'd update my review. 

 I absolutely love their Kobe burger but finally forced myself to try something different.  One particular week,  I had my fair share of beef so I decided to try their turkey burger.  It wasn't the usual one on the menu but was a Thanksgiving special.  This burger was exactly the Thanksgiving turkey burger you would imagine - moist turkey burger, cranberry sauce, and stuffing - fantastic.  I was so disappointed they only serve it around Thanksgiving.  After delighting in my usual Kobe burger again for a while, I tried their regular turkey burger and it, too, is tasty (especially with mushrooms).  But the burger with the stuffing and cranberry sauce is something I'm going to indulge in again next Thanksgiving and, being a foodie, I can't wait."}
{"text":"I love the Samburger with Bacon and Avocado! BUT... I was SOLD once I ordered the Double Truffle Fries!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I love the creative burgers. The grill on the burgers are perfect medium as I requested. The shakes - my kids LOVE them! Great quality and fantastic service! Ask for Danielle. She is simply wonderful - and we came on a crazy busy Sunday."}
{"text":"So glad I finally came to Zinburger! The burger was clearly delicious, but we did not drink here. We got a variety of fries for the table, and that was the best choice of the entire meal! You can't go wrong with any of them!!!

The patio was great, right in the middle of the Scottsdale Quarter, so there was a lot of activity to look at and a lot of people to watch. Helps that it's Arizona and always beautiful here, so we will come back another time just for that dang patio. 

Service was just okay, which is why this place only got 4 stars. Would have been 5 if it did not take forever for someone to even say hi to us, but they were really busy. It was lunch rush, but some acknowledgement would be nice."}
{"text":"Green Chile Fries.....Amazing!!! Service is slow but good food takes time. I had an El Diablo burger and it was so good. This is the second time we've been here and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We went at dinnertime on a Sunday I believe, fairly early around 5:30 pm and still was quoted a 45 minute wait. We managed to get seats at the bar and were eating our food when I got the text that our table was ready. :) 

On to the food - I did like the specialty fries, we tried the Loaded Fries and the Spicy Green Chili Fries. Both were very good but seemed like not very much fries or toppings for the $7 price.  We then had the Zinburger and El Diablo. Again, both were very good, and the portions were accurate but I would have liked to have a bit more of the toppings. The burger was very juicy and it tends to soak into the bun so it was a bit of a mess to eat. The flavors overall were good. 

The atmosphere is great - there is a wide open bar area that opens to the street so on the cooler days, there is a lovely breath of fresh air and feel of wide open space through the restaurant. I would imagine in the summer they probably do not open up the window but I am not sure.  It has a very trendy feel. The staff was very polite and accommodating.  We may go back, but would not likely go out of our way to go there - not to say that anything about it was bad.  I would say that while my 8 year old was able to eat a plain cheeseburger there, it was not really a good place for kids."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place before heading to the Apple Store.  We were the first customers to arrive at 11:00.  Service was poor, to much talking with the associates behind the bar area.  Seating new customers but not attending the customers who were already seated and eating.  Not cleaning off the tables as a customer leaves.  Our burgers were cooked to our liking but a very bland flavor.  No taste at all and very difficult to eat with no flavor.  We enjoyed the Strawberry Shake, my soda was very weak.  Watered down!  A bit pricey since all you get is a bland burger for $12.00!!  We waited 10 minutes for our waitress to bring our bill.  Needless to say, we won't be back!  My husband makes a much better, tasty, juicy burger then the Zinburger does!  We could not enjoy our lunch and feel we wasted $40.00!!  We will go back to our originally places for a good, decent burger that is less pricey!"}
{"text":"Shakes were so yummy!!!! Got the Kobe burger and zen burger... They were both great! Also ordered the zucchini fries.. They were pretty good but I have had better. Regular fries were great!!"}
{"text":"Great burger place! So many choices and always delicious. Best service by Mallory she is super friendly and always gives us the best service!"}
{"text":"Your milkshakes brings me back to your restaurant, and you're like, \"Awesome, cool!\"

But seriously, whenever my wife and I go, it is always one milkshake, sweet potato or truffle fries, and an awesome burger.  I see people saying it is pricey and the burgers are ok.  On the other hand, there burgers are quality meat with toppings that shine bright like a diamond.  i really don't know why I said that, maybe adding to the milkshake theme I had going earlier, but in all honesty, there are various toppings to choose from that makes them different than any chain burger place.

The location is great with the decor and ambience relaxing for a great date night in the Biltmore area.  I cannot complain about service, because it has always been top notch whenever we went.  You definitely pay what you get for being in the Biltmore area.  We will see you again you delicious milkshake and sweet potato fry!"}
{"text":"I've been to Zinburger before, went to a different location. My food was ok, one of the people I went with had a better burger. Service was standard, it was a good vibe, enjoyed my time."}
{"text":"Hubby, baby and I ate lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  We were excited to eat here, as we are great fans of Fox Restaurants.

During the day, this place is great for kids.  There is a nice patio with lots of open space, perfect for fitting a stroller or high chair next to a table.  It has a nice crisp ambiance, and it's great for people-watching.

The menu is simple, a few burgers, a few salads, a few sides, a few deserts.  The burger options are a bit limited, but the menu does allow you to customize your burger with several toppings with variations ranging from manchego cheese, caramelized onions, avocado to truffle oil.

Hubby and I decided to split the zin burger, the BLT salad and the truffle fries with truffle aioli.

The zin burger was delicious.  It was topped with onions which had been caramelized in Zinfandel, manchego cheese, mayonnaise on a whole wheat bun.  The onions paired well with the cheese, and we were definitely satisfied.  The burgers are cooked to order, and it was cooked perfectly.  The burger was enormous, and we definitely felt as though to feel satisfied and full, we did not need the salad we had ordered.

This was fortunate because the salad was lacking.  The bacon tasted like bacon bits, it was sprinkled with powdered parmesan cheese, the tomatoes were mealy and the \"cowboy\" ranch dressing tasted like Hidden Valley.  It came with what was probably romaine lettuce, but it was so pale, it looked like sad leafs of iceberg lettuce.  We were not impressed, and pretty much left the salad untouched.

The truffle fries were definitely the best part of the meal.  They were golden and crispy, with just the perfect amount of truffle oil.  The aioli didn't really stand up to the fries, but was still good.

All in all, while I would go back to Zinburger, it is definitely not one of the better Fox Concepts restaurants."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time today and had a wonderful experience. Everything from the young lady who sat us. To the man that served us his name is Marcus and he was really helpful with explaining the menu and letting me know what my options were. I ordered the California burger with bacon, medium well, and it came out quickly and it was delicious. I highly recommend this place. Very accommodation and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I will most defiantly be coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"First time coming here and had a great experience. Great service and the food was delicious. I had the buffalo chicken burger and it was on point."}
{"text":"Great place for casual dining!  I have been here several times and all of the food I have had was delicious.  The service is always good and they always feature and shake of the week and burger of the week.  Its a great place to go if you are looking for something casual.  They have more than just burgers and its a great place for kids as well."}
{"text":"Leggo my manchego. 

So I looove manchego cheese and am elated that I get to put it on my hamburger. I also love my burgers big and greasy. Topped with some zinfandel braised onions and it's a combination dreams are made of. 
The kind of burger you hold to you and whisper \"never let me go\". 

Okay, that's a little melodramatic, but damn it's a good burger. 

The fries are a bit of a disappointment, Delux's are better. I've only had the chocolate shake which I shared with my sister...also excellent. 

4 stars for manchego-y goodness!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, love the openness and simplicity. Wait was 20 mins on a Saturday at 1pm, staff was friendly. it is a little loud, but the food is so good you don't need to talk. Had the breakfast burger, so scrumptious! Had the oriental salad which was also delicious but overpriced for the portion, I thought maybe they had split the salad for us, but nope, it's small. Onion rings and zucchini fries were gone so fast they were that good. Will definitely come back, great for dates."}
{"text":"This place has a serious Happy Hour. Their price to quality/fun ratio is off the charts good.  Any place that throws a 20oz Fresh Squeezed IPA on Tap for half price earns immediate credibility.  Throw in a M/R breakfast burger and I'm as happy as a dog in stink.  

Their shakes are insane i've got a tip for ya... Get the BANANA ROYALE but with Chocolate Ice cream,  You can thank me later.  

Zin also nailed the inside / outside deal very well and the whole place is well designed.  The bar stools are not very comfortable but it could just be my wookiee ass.  They have some good railing for bikes 

One point knocked because I like to eat several apps sometimes rather than one entree.  At Zin I've yet to find an app that I really like.  That portion of their menu does not match the rest in quality or variety."}
{"text":"SIL and I went here and had an outstanding burger experience!  I just wish there was one closer to my side of town :(  Alas, when we want a guaranteed good burger experience (a la 'non-fast-food' style), we know here's where it's at.  Plus, who doesn't enjoy having a glass of zin with their burger.. mine certainly paired perfectly.

I had the Zinburger and was *loving* the cheese (I like funky cheeses on my beef), but what stood out the most was the perfectly cooked and moist (and a little pink) patty.  These people know when to stop cooking the patty (unlike some other places I've recently reviewed.. ugh).  My SIL had the same but I had added a few toppings (hence mine was a little more pricey but had much more interesting flavors with every bite).  We decided to split the sweetpot fries.. .oof, so good!  I don't think I'm a fan of their dipping sauce, but I don't need no stinkin' dipping sauce for my fries.. they were well cooked and very plentiful.. enough to share!

We sat outside in the patio area and, though it was busy busy busy (as always), we had good service and the atmosphere was really relaxing and up-beat at the same time."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Zin Burger this evening. We had the best service ever! Austin was hands down the best server around. He was super attentive and on point with his customer service! Fox restaurant concepts is lucky to have him as a an asset to their team!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I am definitely a fan. Food is freshly cooked and you can tell they dont use frozen chicken. A little pricey but if you want an amazing fresh sandwich, so worth it!"}
{"text":"Burgers were under-seasoned for my liking. Buns didn't hold up. I expect the burger to shine in a place like this, and I was disappointed in that regard. The service and onion rings were excellent though."}
{"text":"Decided to meet for lunch and was seated promptly and our server was on the spot immediately to take our lunch requests.
My choice was the Kobe burger with melted cheddar with mushrooms and a order of fries. My friend had the regular burger, blue cheese I believe.
 The burgers arrived shortly and the first bite put a smile on my face...I don't know why, I was drinking water...oh well. It was very good  , but the somewhat lukewarm burger could have been hotter if it just came off the grill and the cheese was over melted to the point that I could not taste the sharpness of the cheddar.

I exchanged a slice of friends burger and vice verse and we could not tell the difference between Kobe or regular beef. The were both equally good. My suggestion is that unless you're really an expert on beef order the regular and you'll still have a smile on your face.

The home made fries were nothing to brag about even if you're from Idaho and those too could have been hotter if they just exited the deep fat fryer.
I will return to Zinburger and next time have a few cold ones which will really put a bigger smile on my face."}
{"text":"Now that the city of Gilbert is expanding, I guess it's not the smartest / most ideal of plans to go to any of the restaurants in the Gilbert Downtown area due to the ridiculously long wait times. We decided we'd stop by because we really wanted to try Zinburger & figured we'd just grab a small something to snack on from the food trucks across the street while we waited ... for an hour and a half. I have never done that & will probably never do that again.

Once we finally got our table, we were seated outside on a chilly night literally in the corner by the one heater that was broken. Already not impressed. We weren't the only people who were cold / who questioned it either - the table next to us, also under the same broken heater, also were asking about getting some warmth. When our waiter came by, we were so hungry & annoyed by being seated in a bad spot that we put in our order immediately. I got the Turkey Sloppy Joe & my date got the Kobe Burger and we got an order of the Double Truffle Fries to share. Our food came out reasonably quickly considering how busy it was. My Turkey Sloppy Joe was cold and greasy. The Sloppy Joe ... sauce? I guess, was good and the sandwich was prepared okay, it just seemed like it had maybe been sitting there for a while as it had gotten soggy. My date was really excited about the Kobe Burger but was disappointed after only a bite or two. I'm not a beef eater, but he said compared to other burgers he's gotten at other places, there really wasn't anything special about it ... and if anything, it actually just tasted fatty. The fries were pretty good. They were lacking truffle flavor even though they were called Double Truffle Fries but the dipping sauce that came with it was really delicious.

I don't know how all the other items are but more likely than not, I won't be finding out!"}
{"text":"Omg came for a weekly cheat meal just thought it would be an average burger but who woulda thunk it??? These burgers are the bomb! And then the sides... WOW! We tried the truffle fries and green chili fries and they were both amazing! They don't lie when they say big enough for two. Then we had the Blanco burger well done and the My Boy Bleu medium well. Both burgers were great but I do recommend the medium well. Everything was very flavorful especially for a burger place. Oh and I must mention they have amazing happy hour specials! You should check it out!"}
{"text":"Really nice quality food and service. Lots of places to get a burger but this place is tops! Fresh everything and super happy hour where beer and wine 1/2 off! The Banana cream pie wow!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and sat in the bar area. I ordered the onion rings for an appetizer and they were pretty good but nothing special. For my entree, I ordered the Kobe Burger cooked medium rare with a side of Truffle Fries. The burger was decent but a little over cooked and the bun was also too soggy. Overall, the burger tasted pretty good but I was expecting a little more special. I enjoyed the Truffle Fries. The service was great and everyone in the restaurant was nice."}
{"text":"We were in the area with a couple of customers and decided to take them to Zinburger.  I will say that this place is amazing.  I ordered the Zinburger cooked throughout and it was perfection.  We tried a side of regular fries and the truffle fries too.  I will say they were pretty good.  I am not a big French fries person, but these were good.  There was a butterfinger shake ordered too and the customer said it was yummy.  Like this place and recommend it to everyone.  I remember the last time I was here the bread was different.  That was not the case this time.  The entire meal was good and our customers had a great time and meal.  Thanks"}
{"text":"This place is so good! The service is friendly and fast and the turkey burger is to die for!! Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"I'm here on business and the bartender was so welcoming and sweet! I felt so at home here and like he really cared! Charming and awesome food!! I'm very impressed - sadly I did not get his name but he looks like Ryan Reynolds with a beard.  Hostess was super friendly too!! Kudos to Zinburger - great team!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the mood for a good, solid burger I head over to Zinburger at Biltmore Fashion Park. I like how simple the menu is so it is not too overwhelming, yet there is something for everyone. I am a little obsessed with their zucchini fries, although I do wish they came out with my burger instead of before. The burgers are always good and they're big enough to share if you're not too hungry. I always say I'm going to try one of their shakes or pies for dessert, but I'm always too full from the burger and fries. Maybe next time. :)"}
{"text":"Wow.  The shakes and zucchini fries were absolutely amazing!

Unfortunately my date and I were a bit underwhelmed by the burgers.  I got the Breakfast Burger and she got the Turkey Burger.  Good, but not excellent.

We look forward to returning, even for just the shakes and zucchini fries!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You dang right. I'm a vegetarian and they had a veggie burger that is one of the best you can get. I hear their meat is good too. LOL. Great selection of wines here and they are at an awesome price. They have nice comfortable bar and really cool setup. Eat here and you will feel good and look good"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.   Waited ten minutes just to get water.  Food was just okay for $10.00+ burgers.  Manager apologized for the long wait to get service and offered to take care of the sweet potato fries we ordered."}
{"text":"Zing-An really enjoyed his zin burger.  I really enjoyed my breakfast burger (with a fried egg on top, avocado and bacon).  It is easy to see Zinburger adds great allure to the atmosphere of the ever changing and energized down town Gilbert.  These are exciting times here."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite burger place. The food was extremely fresh and obviously tasted like real food. You know, the kind that isn't fake and filled with more fake crap. The french fries were perfectly crispy and the shakes, oh my word, the shakes. So flavorful and so amazing. My husband and I are not small eaters. We can pack food down. However, we only ordered one burger, an order of fries (which feeds 2-3 people), and a single shake and we were plenty full by the end of the meal. We even had to take some food home. That was fine with us, because the food is a little on the pricey side, which is my only complaint. But, since we only needed to order one meal, the price was right for us. They are used to people splitting meals, so everything was brought out in separate serving dishes, including our shake. Our second time dining here we brought my son, who was a little under 18 months old at the time. We ordered him a kids meal an holy crap it was a huge meal. My husband ended up eating most of it and he said that the kids meal burger was actually better than the one he ordered. So, that stood out to me as I wouldn't necessarily say kid's meals are the priority at any restaurant.  Any time I'm in Gilbert I will gladly dine here again."}
{"text":"We were so excited to find a place that has grass-fed burgers AND gluten free buns!! This is by far the best burger joint in Arizona. The loaded fries, truffle fries, and sweet potato fries are to die for! And to top it all off, the Hazelnut Nutella Crunch Milkshake is divine!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch this afternoon. Love this location in Downtown Gilbert. Always a long wait during peak times but more on that in a few. Food has been very good every visit! Comes out fast once seated. My wife loves the zucchini fries and I am a fan of loaded fries. Keep wanting to try the Buffalo Chicken but cant get away from ordering a burger. Manager Colleen is awesome and is always working the dining room with a smile and helping the staff! Thank you ! Today we had Jiana as our server and she was fantastic, had a great playful personality and took great care of us and made us laugh and enjoy the experience even better than other visits. 

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars IMHO is the managing the door. Soooo many open tables for long periods of time is frustrating from a guest standpoint. From what I can tell the kitchen is usually on point or at least not that slow and plenty of staff so not sure why holding the door every single  time we have been there. 

Overall though love this location, starting with manager Colleen and now the server Jiana!

Oh and the pies are absolutely delicious!! 

Thank you Zinburger Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Staying at Biltmore for business and decided to check this place out since was nearby and menu looked great. 
Absolutely fabulous! Started with Zucchini fries and Loaded Fries and both were very good. 
Next on to the burgers, all 3 in my party were big fans of the burgers, especially the bread. Burger was cooked perfect medium rare. 
Great food but the service was even better! Sammie (sp?) came over to our table with a big smile and clearly happy to be there which made me happier to be there! 
She made some recommendations and was pleasant to talk to! Great job and thank you for being you! The manager was super nice and stopped at our table and thanked us for coming in. 

I would def tell others about this place, the service and the food! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The Ringer burger, and Green Chile Fries with Bacon. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"$12 Burger was good ( overpriced )  , $5 fries are small portions, 
 great location...."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice ambiance and quick and efficient service. The Loaded and Zucchini fries were delicious!! The El Diablo Burger was literally the best burger I have ever had. I will definitely be a repeat customer! I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed lunch today at Zinburger's in the Biltmore Fashion Mall.  Their beef patty in their \"Zinburger\" entree was fresh and juicy.  The bun was bakery soft and on the sweet side.  The chopped wedge salad though, arrived at room temperature and the lettuce, not so crisp.  Generous on the bacon, egg, tomato and dressing but not as good as it could have been.   My dining partners enjoyed the parmesan topped truffle fries that were hand cut.  We appreciated the efficient service even though our server didn't look too happy today.  I  had a better experience this afternoon than I've had at their North Scottsdale location.  I would dine here again!"}
{"text":"Went there on Wednesday night about 5:45. My boyfriend and I were seated right away and had a great waiter named Justin. He was very friendly, helpful and courteous as a waiter should be. I had the build your own angus burger wrapped in lettuce with bacon, mushrooms and Havarti and it was served very fast. A little messy that way but the lettuce was firm and crisp so it worked perfectly for my low carb diet and was delicious. Although we did have the zucchini fries, zucchini is low carb, right? :)  Anyway they were hot and crisp and the sauce was very tasty. My boyfriend had a regular Zinburger and he said very good and it was cooked perfectly how he asked, that does not always happen at other places. The atmosphere was not overdone for being at Biltmore nor was it too noisy. Did not try the shakes because with my food I was pleasantly full. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I heart Zinburger!! We've been going to the Gilbert location since its opening and it's amazing every time. It's my absolute favorite burger place and I've tried a LOT of different places. Zin is the gold standard and I've yet to find a burger that comes close to the awesomeness of a Zinburger. The green chile fries and milkshakes are also amazing and they are the perfect compliment to my favorite meal."}
{"text":"Samburger was amazing, best burger I've ever had. Loved their truffle fries nice and crispy. It was very crowded but no wait to sit at the bar. I will def be back!! Another Gilbert favorite."}
{"text":"You have great managers in the world and bad managers.  Great managers will listen to customers and investigate if there is a problem.  Bad managers will just blow off customers and be condescending.   Since great managers actually listen to feedback they will investigate and if there is a problem no matter now small they will correct it.  That is what a great manager does.  Bad managers will just cash their checks till a place closes down then they will go to the next place and rinse and repeat.

Caitlin Jensen is a great manager.  Caitlin listens to customers, actually reads the reviews and corrects the problem.  Caitlin read my review that they over-salted my meal and contacted me.  Said hey we pride ourselves on quality and said give us a second try.   I believe in second chances because we all have off days, so I took her up on her offer.  Only the second time this have ever happened since I have been Yelping from 2010 with over 153 reviews.    Now think about how many garbage managers never took the time to reach out.   That is what separates Caitlin from all the mediocrity I have dealt with in my life.  Now I want to make this very clear.  I don't go around bitching and moaning trying to get meals comped.  I am not that person.   If you read my reviews you will get 100% unadulterated truth from my perspective.  I am not nor will I ever be an elite 100 yelper that goes around eating free food and dishing out FAKE REVIEWS.      I promise you authenticity. 

So on to my second review.   I headed back to ZinBurger on Super Bowl Sunday.   I know a crazy time to go back.  But I did it.   I mixed things up a bit this time.   I didn't order the Truffle fries.  I kept it simple with regular fries.   100% perfect.    Crispy and seasoned to perfection.   My Zinburger was great, onions were very good wine flavor they had been sautéd in.  And the beers I ordered were great.  I just said dealers choice and bring me a bunch till the game was over.  Yeah I got a bit drunk.  

Carlos Sr came with me.  He ordered the El Diablo and stole about half my fries.  He ate that thing so fast I don't think he had any problem with the flavor.

So yeah before Zinburger had an off day or I was completely bombed drunk during the Super Bowl this time to notice the neither.   Either way I had a great time and they made a ton of money on me today by inviting me back. hahahahahaha   Kudos.     Class acts.   I will be back.  Nice people."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially the bacon bloody Mary. But can I please get a single serving of fries? All their sides require a two-person order. Come on!"}
{"text":"Love this place... had some family in town and we took them for burgers here... party of 6 on a saturday night - we were early enough that the wait was minimal.

It's always great food... always great wine... my \"mother in law\" said it was literally the best burger she's ever had.

Service was attentive and engaging.

A little pricey but not overly so.

The ambiance was pleasant on the patio... with the weather and the people watching."}
{"text":"Try the Ahi tuna burger with a side of truffle fries! The semi-sweet bread with slices of avocado really adds to the flavors of the ahi. 

Super fresh and tasty. 

Best of all - happy hour 
- half off sides!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and can't believe that I haven't given them a review yet!

In all the times that I have been here, I always go with the Breakfast Burger.  Fried egg on a burger with bacon? Yes please!

The burgers are so juicy and delicious, with the avocado and cheesy, it feels almost wrong... almost.

The reason I couldn't give them a 5 star rating is that I have a fundamental problem with fries that you have to order as a side, ESPECIALLY at a burger place.  Now, that being said, they have good fries and even better zucchini fries.  They certainly give enough for there to be two servings but again, additional charges for fries just seems wrong at a burger place.  I could see there being an upcharge for loaded fries or zucchini fries or even just to make them sweet potato fries.

They have a great selection of beers (my personal favorite is Left Coast \"Voodoo\" American Stout which I've never seen offered anywhere else in Arizona so that was a bonus point) and drinks to accompany the meals.

The shakes are a great way to finish off the meal, sometimes they have specialty shakes such as the Butterfinger (shake which I think is now on the regular menu) which is just amazing.

Little on the pricey side but well worth it for a good burger."}
{"text":"Just want to give a thumb's up to Zinburger staff for treating their customers well.  We were seated much more quickly than they estimated (they probably lose customers because they overestimate -- told us it would be 20-30 minutes, and it was 7).  The food was very good - excellent hamburgers, cooked perfectly, very good ahi tuna, again, cooked the way I asked for it.  But, food delivery took forever.  Several people came over to apologize for the delay, and to tell us they were going to take care of us....did we want free dessert (nope), so they comped our drinks and fries, and gave us a discount off the total.  More than we would have expected.  Very nicely done.  We'll be back.  Also a very pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Their burger with the egg on it is ridiculous. In the best way possible."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The outdoor seating area is great under the lights as the sun goes down. Lots of kids being next to a splash pad. Not a good or bad thing just something to know."}
{"text":"We ate at the Zinburger in Tucson and loved it!  So glad they opened one here... can't wait to go!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced delicious food with an atmosphere to match ... what more could you want? Burgers here are proportioned just right (bun to patty ratio as I call it) and leave you with a feeling of being on cloud nine (the bun is also warmed). The wait-staff are all very knowledgeable to gluten-free (SO has celiac) restrictions and even have a dedicated fryer (Parm Truffle Fries are unbelievable)."}
{"text":"We always enjoy our visits to Zinburger. Try to go at an off time because this place gets really busy!!! Food is always excellent.  Pricey; fries come when separately ordered. The loaded fries are great! The Samburger is my favorite!"}
{"text":"***Zinburger is a small Phoenix burger chain from a restaurant group (Fox Restaurant Concepts) that has several restaurants--mostly in Phoenix though I think some of their restaurants are coming to Los Angeles; the food here is okay but definitely not as good as some of Los Angeles' great burger spots like Father's Office and Short Order***

Zinburger is located in Biltmore Fashion Park, which is an upscale outdoor mall just outside of Downtown Phoenix.  Biltmore Fashion Park has a few upscale shops like J. Crew, Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn, but it seems to have even more dining options--a lot of chains from upscale ones like The Capital Grille to moderately priced ones like California Pizza Kitchen.  Zinburger seems to be one of the more local or at least regional places here.

Zinburger has a clean and simple indoor dining room.  The dining room is very minimalist and no frills, but it is modern and comfortable.  An outdoor dining patio is also available, but it would probably be quite uncomfortable dining outside during Phoenix's hot summers.

Because Zinburger is a burger spot, prices are not too high for dinner.  Zinburger is a gourmet burger spot though so burgers run $10 here.  You can upgrade to an American Kobe beef patty for an extra $5.  All sides are a la carte and are large sides that are suited for two or three people.

Salads are also available as well as an assortment of shakes and not just traditional flavors.  Shakes are very dessert-focused here--shakes based on popular and longstanding desserts like crème brulee, strawberry cheesecake and bananas foster.

Zinburger's menu setup is also a tad similar to The Counter.  Like The Counter, Zinburger has a build-your-own-burger option where you can choose between quite a few toppings, cheeses and sauces.  The Counter showcases special burgers (and I believe shakes) for the month and so does Zinburger.

I had Zinburger's El Diablo burger.  The burger came with fire roasted jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, and chipotle mayo.  I also upgraded the patty to American Kobe beef.  The burger itself was pretty good.  It had a good flavor and was juicy enough.  It did not have the juiciness of a very great burger, but it was definitely not dry.  I am not sure how much the American Kobe added.  I have never been a big fan of American Kobe beef; it lacks the richness of Japanese Kobe.  The burger patty was good though their regular patty might be good as well.

The toppings were okay.  The burger was not too spicy.  It could have used a little more heat though occasionally the burger had nice heat.  I wish the burger had greens though to add freshness and balance.  It seems like a lot of their signature burgers lack greens and lettuce, which I think is a big miss.

Their hand cut fries were just okay.  They were thin fries and they could have been crispier.  The zucchini fries could have been crispier too.  The flavor of the zucchini fries were good though and they came with a decent Parmesan ranch dipping sauce.

I had their Bars of Zin shake, which was chocolate ice cream, melted chocolate and praline flakes.  The shake had a good consistency.  It was smooth and thick but still very drinkable.  The flavor was good.  It had a good chocolate flavor without being too rich.  The praline flakes were just okay.  It did not add the crispiness I would have preferred.

Service was good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.

As already mentioned, prices are not too bad.  Overall, you can get out of here with a filling dinner for not that much money.  That being said, the burgers and shakes here are expensive for casual food given their gourmet label and significant portion sizes.

Zinburger is an okay burger spot.  In terms of flavor, I would definitely put it above a spot like The Counter.  I would say though that Father's Office and Short Order are significantly better than Zinburger and I would even prefer spots like 25 Degrees over Zinburger too.

As mentioned earlier, Zinburger is located in Biltmore Fashion Park, which offers both pay self and valet parking.  Zinburger does validate parking (I believe they validate up to 2 hours)."}
{"text":"Came here for dog brunch on a rainy Sunday and it was great. The staff was very attentive and friendly. I didn't realize things were a la carte but it was all worth the price. My Blanco burger was excellent and I ended up taking half of it home because I was too busy eating the truffle fries. I also had the hazelnut Nutella shake and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great burgers, whatever kind of meat you want (or veggie)!  The shakes were absolutely amazing as were the zucchini fries.  Definitely a little on the pricey side, but worth it as a special treat!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad to give Zin Burger a 3 star but only because they totally misrepresented themselves at the Waste Management Open. :-/ 3 syllables and more to describe their Chicken Sandwich at the WM Open was dis-gust-ing!!!!! The chicken was burnt. The burger buns were blah. And it tasted like a $1.00 (max) sandwich. Not $9.00. So not worth it. This is not a regular menu item and neither was the rest of their menu choices there. It was cheap, disgusting garbage burgers - worse than fast food restaurants. In fact, McDonald's $1.00 spicy McChicken is 10 times better. Wish Zin Burger actually served their normal gourmet burgers there. 

On a positive side, I really do love their veggie burger, Kobe burger, ahi sandwich, zinburger, sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Every time I go there the ingredients are fresh, the \"meaty part\" is not burnt, the burger is made perfect and the burger buns are fluffy. Gourmet burgers!!

So if you never tried their place and tried it for the first time at the WM Open, trust me, it's def not the same!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I never heard of this place previously and just happened to walk by and try it. Without having any expectations, it's true what people say, the burgers are good, but the price you pay for what you get really isn't worth it. 

With \"burger\" in the restaurant name, I was expecting a multitude of burgers to choose from, but there are a limited amount of burgers listed on the menu. The burgers range from $9-$14 and with a higher price, you'd think you'd get a side of fries or something, however, you only pay for the burger. 

I was surprised when the burgers came out with no sides included so my boyfriend and I ordered a side of sweet potato fries. They were decent, but for $5, the \"basket\" seemed more like a handful. We also ordered the Peach Cobbler Shake of the month and weren't really blown away...it was just vanilla ice cream with peaches on top.

Finally, Zinburger keeps the doors open. It makes the restaurant seem more breathable which makes sense because their interior is simple with fresh colors, but leaving the doors open means flies come in. My boyfriend and I were constantly swatting flies away from our food when we sat down, when we were eating, and when we were signing the check. 

Overall, I've had better. For two people, we spent $45. The food is good, but definitely not worth the money and fly-filled atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love the quality, variety and taste of the burgers! Rolls are fresh and pickles are good. Have tried 3 different kinds of fries and they good but would prefer a skinless version. The milkshakes are delicious and can be taken in a \"to go\" cup! 

Major disappointment that Pepsi is the mail soda... YUCK!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a week on business, and decided to try it out.  The Zinburger was  excellent!  I'd rank it in my top ten burgers, but to be perfectly honest, it was overshadowed by the Bloody Bacon!  A perfect bloody mary, made with bacon infused vodka, and with a perfect bacon beacon sticking out the top?  Come on!  How can you go wrong?  I've been craving another one for the last month...  Is it nuts to go 2000 miles for a drink?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a burge; good family ambiance. The quality is like Umami Burger but the taste is different. Everything from the meat , buns, and veggies are fresh and very tasty. 

Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will stop by again."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Zinburger on a Sunday evening and were more that pleased with the food and service.  Austin was amazing and was very attentive to our every need. He answered questions, made great recommendations and provided service that was second to none. We loved the food, but if we didn't, we would still come back just because of Austin. Do yourself a favor, visit Zinburger and ask for Austin."}
{"text":"I've been to Zinburger many times and the food is always very tasty. The employees are very accommodating. Last visit, my mom and I decided we'd sit outside. That was a bad choice because the temperature was over 100 degrees. We asked to be moved inside and they said its be no problem at all. They didn't protest at all and did it with a smile on their face. In my opinion, the service can help make or break a meal. Zinburger, you've got great employees and the perfect environment, thank you for a great meal."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday afternoon for late lunch.  The place was packed even this early.  Got seated in the bar at the taller tables which weren't too comfortable.  Oh well.  Waitress was very friendly.  We started with the fried zucchini appetizer.  Came out quickly.  Taste was so-so.  Batter kept falling off the vegetable and the zucchini were very mushy.  Did not care for this dish at all. Three of us ordered burgers and one had the chicken sandwich.  My burger was good.  Not great but good.  Seemed to be lacking seasoning.  The other two people said the same about their burgers.  The fourth in our party had the chicken sandwich and it was awesome.  Wow.  Very good.  I will order this next time.  Three of us had shakes and they were tasty.  Our bill for 4 people was around $120 with tip. A bit pricey but we splurged.  Return factor :75%"}
{"text":"I always order the veggie burger with no bun, no cheese, no mayo, extra pickles. It's vegan and it's damn good. The reason it's damn good is because of the fact that it's made in-house with a delicious concoction of seasonings. When I got it for takeout tonight, I knew something wasn't right. It was bland, and it never is. I was reluctant to call because I knew they were busy. When I called, the manager on duty tonight (the one with a beard, sorry I didn't get a name) was very apologetic and ready to make it up. I came back and they remade my veggie patty perfectly, and gave me EXTRA pickles, like a tub of them, which was awesome."}
{"text":"Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had is the Zinburger. Truffle fries are also delicious. Always have good service here and leave very satisfied. Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose, but not snobby as some complain. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and feel right at home here."}
{"text":"Great burgers! 
Prickly pear margarita was amazing! Bartenders are super friendly!! #shanna&Ryan"}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for lunch on a Saturday.  We arrived early and easily got a booth.  Our waiter was very cheerful and patient, as several had special requests. The food arrived quickly--moist, delicious burgers and loads of fries all around. Everyone enjoyed.  Minor warning-as the restaurant filled up, it became very noisy.  Good place for a causal, quick  lunch."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but it was the staff that really made our experience worthy of 5stars. Stumbled on Zinburger mostly out of convenience of location and the fact that my mom was craving a burger on her birthday. The hostess heard a subtle remark about it being my moms birthday and informed our server, who put a candle in her milkshake and made her day. Such a simple gesture but the fact that they did this all on their own was so cute! Aside from that, our server Stevan was professional and just the right amount of attentive. Like I said, food was delicious and I appreciate the quality of meats used."}
{"text":"All around great experience. 

Friendly hosts and waitress. 

Menu has plenty of great options - burgers, fries, chicken, ahi...

Had the Ringer. Great burger. Everything about it was spot on - flavors were fantastic, meat like melted in my mouth, bacon was crispy and flavorful. 

Fries were crispy and nicely salted. Green chili cheese was a nice side. 

Cool ambiance. Price is as expected for a nice burger place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time for my birthday. I tried the Kobe burger.  The wife got the samburger. The samburger was tasty. The Kobe burger was ok but was it real kobe beef cause the texture and taste of just the meat alone tasted the same as the samburger.  A little over priced for just a burger the fries or onion rings are extra."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get the green chili fries. I come here at least once a month just to order this and a beer and it fills me up. 

Great service and I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"My burger melted in my mouth! I ordered the \"el diablo\", and we all shared zucchini fries, sweet potato fries, as well as onion rings. So very tasty. I had a glass of chardonnay, and although everything was cooked to perfection, this place would have gotten five stars if it weren't too expensive for everything ordered. Not to mention the hostess forgot to give us kids menus and were not brought to us till it was time to go.  We basically just had to ask if they served kid burgers, no big deal.  But we will be back next time we are craving melt in your mouth burgers.  Oh, and happy hour looks like a great time to fill up on wine and food for the best prices."}
{"text":"For such a highly rated place what I experienced hopefully was an off-night and not some strange hype related rating disease.  The burger I had was completely average just teetering the line between bad and OK.  Not much flavor to be had, semi-small, pricey burger which is a pretty awful combination.  There are a lot of great burgers in the valley and this was very much not one of them."}
{"text":"Here on vacation at a nearby resort and stopped by for a supposed good burgers. 

Finding a parking space was pretty bad experience since this burger place is located in a very busy shopping center, but, at least, we were given forewarning about it. 

We ordered four gourmet burgers, prices ranging from $8.25 - $15/burger. The kids meal deal was just unheard of which included one choice from each section: main meal (hamburger, cheese burger, grilled cheese, chicken tenders, etc), a drink (soft drinks, strawberry lemonade, etc with French fries or salad), and dessert (various shakes). All these for ONLY $5.00!! Needless to say, the place was very loud with lots of families with children. 

Burgers: EXCELLENT!!
Service: Good and she stopped by to attend to our needs but rather artificially friendly waitress with cold smiles
Shakes: $5.00/ea, not as good as expected. The Nutella shake had lots of nuts which was ok and the straw that came with it was too narrow in diameter for the nuts. A small basketful of Truffle French Fries and Onion Rings (8 onion rings in an order) were $6/each. 
Price: total bill over $102.00 overpriced burger place overall"}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience. From the time we sat down we were welcomed and given a very professional run through of the menu by Megan. You could tell she was excellently trained and had a lot of knowledge about items on the menu. I ordered the Zinburger medium with a Bloody Mary. Both items were wonderful and the burger was cooked exactly to medium. As a server I can appreciate good service and Zinburger killed it."}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love their work uniform! It is so cute!! For a Sunday brunch we got seated quickly. Ordered the Parmesan fries and they were awesome! Fries are my weakness, but Parmesan fries have my heart especially when it's paired with truffle! The burgers my boyfriend and I got were so juicy and tender! Overall we really liked the ambience and the friendliness of the servers!"}
{"text":"A little overpriced for what you get, unless you catch them during happy hour. The service could also be better. The last time my husband and I were there the hostess sat us within seconds but then we didn't see a server for at least 10 minutes. During this entire time the three on duty hostesses proceeded to socialize at their wait stand and never once came over to offer a beverage while we waited. They were more concerned with their conversations with each other to service the guests or help any of the seated tables until a server could get to the table. Several people waited a long time and they were not busy at all... 
."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but truth is it was just OK. Plus I got a wedge salad to start...ordered with dressing on the side and it came swimming in ranch. There wasn't a piece of crisp lettuce in the bowl. Should have been taken off the bill but we were charged

The burgers were good, but not great. Better flavor at In-N-Out. Beautiful building, though."}
{"text":"I almost miss the once boutique feel of Sam's restaurants, it seems that it won't be long before every corner features the likes of a FoxRC. However, as a valley food lover I must say bravo to yet another successful venture, Mr. Fox!

I am rating Zinburger a 4 purely in alignment with the other restaurants I've experienced. While it may not be as sophisticated as Modern Steak or trendy like Olive & Ivy, Zinburger has a sleek setting with a great casual outdoor bar and some delicious food!

We started with Sweet Potato Fries with Yogurt Dipping Sauce, Double Truffle Fries (Truffle Aioli & Truffle Oil) and Zucchini Fries (Parmesan & Ranch). All of them were good and would definitely satisfy any salt cravings you might have - so make sure you have a Zin Stinger (Red Zinfandel, Chocolate Sauce, Simple Syrup, Mint Leaves) close at hand!

There were 4 of use, we tried the Turkey Burger (with Swiss Cheese, Avocado & Mayo), Samburger (with Nueske's Applewood Smoked Bacon, American Cheese & Thousand Island Dressing), Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (with Pepperjack Cheese & Ranch Dressing) and lastly the Kobe Burger (with Cheddar Cheese, Wild Mushrooms & Mayo). They were all fantastic, The Kobe and the Turkey were my favorites.

We passed on the shakes for dessert and went for the Banana Creme Pie (YUM!!) and Chocolate Creme Pie. They give you 1/4th of a pie!!! It's a huge slice. I am pretty sure at this point, I should have stopped but when staff recommended the Bacon Bloody Mary, how could this foodie resist?? 

That's right...Bacon-Infused Vodka. The Bacon Bloody Mary.
Because I am hardcore, I went for it. It was really good, I just wouldn't recommend pairing that with Dessert and wouldn't do it again.

All in all, a great experience typical of FoxRC. I'll be back for more, and really enjoyed the relaxed experience and patio at the Biltmore Fashion Park."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. If you like good juicy burgers then go here! Don't forget to get the Angus burger. They cook it perfectly. And get the sweet potato fries, so heavenly."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate here yesterday and we were beyond impressed. I had the Samburger which has bacon and 1000 Island on the burger and he got the special turkey burger (came with a mango salsa - he was very impressed) and we shared a plate of loaded fries...it was perfect. I'm already looking for an excuse to come back because it was just that good."}
{"text":"Went in today and had an okay service. The atmosphere seemed pretty laid back and the design is pretty neat.  The hamburger I had (zinburger) was alright and it lacked presentation when it was served. 

Fries aren't included with the hamburger which I think for the price, they should be. Be ready to pay about $20 for JUST a burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Shakes! Shakes! Shakes! Shakes! Shakes! Errryyyybody (repeat).

Banana's Fosters shake is not getting the love it deserves here on yelp. Let me tell you it will rock your socks!!! Caramelly, banana, topped with delicious whipped cream. So yummy!!!

I ordered the Samburger. It was very tasty. Our server forgot to ask me how I wanted it cooked and so did I, so anyway it was a little more done than I usually order, but that's ok. It was still pretty juicy. I stole some avocado from my friend's turkey burger and I have to say it was a great idea. 

I was disappointed by the sweet potato fries, they weren't too crispy and the flavor was very subtle, almost too subtle. I also didn't care for the sauce.

I will definitely come again for the shakes and burgers. I will give the fries another shot..the truffle ones sound very good.

P.S. Everyone who works here is so fit and very nice from what I experienced :)"}
{"text":"After a seating debacle with being sent outside and then asked by management to go back in and wait which we didn't, our server Jay was awesome! The food was amazing! Had the Diablo burger and the onion rings PRIMO! Highly recommended if u can handle the ding a kings handling the seating. Waited 45 min I know on weekends it's a 2 hr wait but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Yep, this place if top notch for the Gilbert Old Town District.  The pictures on their YELP page is exactly what you get and made me hungry just looking at it.  A choice of Angus or Kobe beef is very cool and the fries are full and awesome.  No room for desert, maybe next time.  Staff was pleasant and attentive which was a relief from the restaurant we just walked out on and that was Barrio Queen which I will review next."}
{"text":"Situated in a cool location with outdoor seating, but the burgers we ordered took a long time (and the place wasn't busy).  When we finally got our food it was cold.  Not sure what happened, may give them another chance sometime."}
{"text":"First visit to Zinburger was decent. Second visit to Zinburger on Monday, March 14th was terrible. I am a food lover and absolutely love a good hamburger. The visit started out with a waiter who was rude to my young son, then fries were brought out that were cold and like pieces of fries not full fries. Then I ate my Kobe beef burger, which isn't the real thing by the way, and felt nauseous while my wife ate her hamburger. Her hamburger was ordered medium well and not until after a few swallowed bites did she realize the hamburger was nearly raw inside. She got sick and became extremely ill in the bathroom. I immediately addressed this with the restaurant manager who told me this had nothing to do with the food! I couldn't believe it! Tried to tell me that my wife couldn't possibly be sick because of the hamburger and it wasn't their fault. Then when I asked to speak with management above her, she walked away and ignored me. Had to take the issue up with another manager. They wiped the bill and told me the GM would be calling me. I then had to fill out a form explaining what happened. While this is happening the waiter says something rude to my 4-year-old son that I'm not going to repeat, embarrassing him. Last time I will eat here. I would suggest you avoid it at all costs and save your money. Go to Lolo's. Place rocks. Pretty bummed about Zinburger. Was hoping it would become a weekly thing."}
{"text":"Food is decent but the service is subpar.  The bottom of a water glass broke out as my elderly father went to take a drink. It spilled all over the table and his lap and mine as well as I was sitting next to him.  The staff came over and asked \"did the glass break? Did it get on the food\" as if this happens all the time.  The glass literally broke in his hand like they put ice water in a cup that must have just come out of the dishwasher.  Then they asked if we needed extra napkins, um yeah we need extra napkins.  They were more concerned about water on the floor and the possibility of having to remake the food their customers comfort or wellbeing.  On top of that we waited 20 mins for a milkshake and root-beer float for the kids.  After asking about it twice they said \"sorry the kitchen is backed up\".  I find it odd they could cook a burger faster than they could scoop ice cream.  We had a table of 5 and a $100+ tab and they didn't even offer to comp drinks after their faulty equipment left us all wet.  It was as if they really didn't care if we stopped in.  There are so many great places to eat in the area (Barrio Queen is our fav and they have a great burger too for the record we have tried just about everything on their menu) I would skip Zin Burger and pick one of the other great options in Gilbert.  Major disappointment."}
{"text":"Omg the truffle fries - I literally would go there for the truffle fries they are to die for ! Plus they have Kobe burgers -if you've never had Kobe you will never go back! There can be a wait but it's totally worth it I have never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"Five (5) StarZZZZZ goes out to our awesome waiter, James!! You rock dude!! He was very patient and quite funny considering we were a large group. And believe me, ordering can be a challenge with our group because our bill all had to be split.  Be thankful for you North Scottsdale residents because if you were in New York, they do not offer that \"kind service!\" LOL :p

In addition to James excellent service, he also gave great recommendation what to order so for me, I had the Zinburger Breakfast Burger and cooked Pink, along with their Caramel Banana Milkshake that was just out of this world. Oh and if you do decide to eat outside like we all did, there is a nice fountain next to you that will even the heat and keep you nice and cool!!

Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. Burger was a bit messy. I had the breakfast burger, delicious and filling. Be ready for a food coma after this place."}
{"text":"Top notch all around. Excellent burgers cooked to perfection,  truffle fries, wonderful wines...THE MILKSHAKES. ONLY drawback - Pepsi products. Nothing goes better w burgers & fries than a diet coke."}
{"text":"(This post is on behalf of my parents who are snowbirds to Arizona from Chicago)

We discovered Zin Burger, sat on the beautiful patio and ordered wine. Jamie,our server, was so bubbly and charming, we returned the next night for dinner. Jamie is very special. She is kind, warm and professional. A role model for all servers! We are definitely coming back and recommending this restaurant to all of our friends. Five star food and service!"}
{"text":"Hell is watching multiple empty tables during your 45-60 minute wait. So, this place on a weekend night. Not even the food can make up for this bs anymore. I am DONE with this location."}
{"text":"Yep. I am fine!  Good, quick, and tasty American favorite!  How can I not be dammit. Everyone go check it out at least once. If I was GF I be all over the shakes they have too. 

Quality service as well!"}
{"text":"First time going and our waiter Devon provided the best restaurant service I've had in a long time. Very friendly and talkative, he objectively explained some of the menu options and talked about creative alternatives that he likes by switching certain ingredients. Very helpful, genuine, and prompt. 

I had the zinburger and switched the lettuce and tomato for sautéed mushrooms. Very juicy and flavorful!! My husband had the Zinger with BBQ sauce instead of Frank's red hot. It was average. However- the buns for the burgers were phenomenal. Perfect burger buns. You can tell they are so good by touch alone as you pick up your burger before you even taste it! The wedge salad was pretty bland (aka crap) and we didn't eat much of it. Sweet potato fries tasted normal and good. And the butterfingers shake was one of the best shakes I've ever had.

Overall it was good food although nothing super unique. Fresh high quality ingredients and the service was amazing. Oh and we didn't even complain but they took the salad off our tab anyway and gave us suggestions for better salad next time (hint- take the wedge off the menu, it's not good!). We will go again I'm sure! 

*id like to give 4 stars for the food and 5 stars for the service but since there is no 4.5 I feel it's deserving to round up to 5 since the waiter was just so good and helpful."}
{"text":"Party of 5 for take out,100 bucks.-No Thank you. Never again. Burgers were not cooked all the way and dripping out blood. 5 $'s for fries-REALLY!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Zinburger!! My husband loves it too, he just doesn't like the prices. I don't care, It's Amazing and I am a believer that you get what you pay for!

They have a New burger every week and most of them are good, but I like their regular zinburger and sweet potato fries with the yogart dip!
L-O-V-E their Bananna Cream Pie!! OMG, but you have to share it, it's Huge!

Best of all, the meat is \"Real\" Lean Cow's Beef! It melts in your mouth like Butter! The staff is friendly for the most part and even funny at times. It's nice sitting outside under the umbrella's when the wheather's not too Hot!

Love, Love, Love Zinburger!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at Zinburger last night.  The Mrs. had a Blanco Burger and I had the Samburger with Kobe beef.  The burgers were awesome.  The loaded fries were delicious too.  And the drinks were great.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Zinburger ranks right up there with my absolute favorite burger spots!  Super duper friendly staff, delicious burgers, addictive fries, and indulgent shakes!  We're routine customers!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Wonedrful restaurant for any kind of burger or amazingly tender chicken. The atmosphere is very inviting and casual."}
{"text":"Shockingly great burger. Being a HUGE In&Out fan (but not a huge fan of fluorescent lights for Date Night)...we were looking for a place to enjoy a burger and a drink.

This is the spot!!!

My husband ordered the burger with pepper jack and guac and bacon. So tasty.

Mine had an egg on it - and was 10x better than Red Robin.

Make sure you get their truffle fries!!!"}
{"text":"Very good burger spot,a bit on the fancier side.

Tried the My Boy Blue (great name) and the El Diablo both with the KOBE option. Both top notch burgers and super tender meat with tasty toppings.

Green Chile fries are really good and a must try.

Also tried the Banana royal shake is was was yummy.

Have plenty of adult beverages to choose from as well. Prickly pear margarita and red zingria were great.

Real open feeling place, sit down order type restaurant. 

Would be 5 Star but its just a bit too pricey."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful and friendly wait staff. The sweet potato fries are amazing and so are the milk shakes. Dog friendly with outside seating too!"}
{"text":"After surviving a pumpkin patch experience with a 20 month old and my Sister we were in the market for dinner. My sister is obsessed with this spot and despite my lobbying efforts for something else- we went here. 

Super cute location in a restaurant rich area. We were seated right away but service was spotty. It wasn't crazy busy but service was slow. From ordering, to having drinks arrive it was just dragging. 

The food is pretty good, but over priced for what you get. It seems as though you're mostly paying for the rent and location- as opposed to the food. 

Dessert was funny, and we wanted to go home so we ordered dessert to-go.  My sis got a shake and I asked if the banana cream pie would be okay to-go, which our server said no problem. When the pie finally came out I started laughing because it looked like a dumpster fire. It was smushed looking but I have a sense of humor and thought it might taste ok. After driving home 25 minutes I placed it in the fridge in the hopes of reviving it, but sadly the pie didn't believe in reincarnation.  So this is a really long way of telling Zinburger that the correct answer to \"Does banana cream pie travel well?\" The answer needs to be a resounding \"Oh sweet baby Jesus- NO!\""}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service not so much. I love this place; their fries are amazing and their beer is always cold. I was disappointed in the service tonight as we sat at the bar. We never were asked for refills on our beers, (constantly having to yell across the bar to get a refill), never asked if we needed anything (or completed our meal for that matter). We usually have a great experience here, but tonight was one for the books. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good burger place if you're in the area. Got the breakfast burger and the burger was delicous. Lagunitas IPA went down amazing with it. Will definitely be stopping in here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always amazing, the service is fast and the location is wonderful. I highly recommend the Buffalo chicken sandwich and the sweet potato fries. (I always get a side of ranch for my fries)."}
{"text":"I don't like gristle in my hamburger so that did it for me. I doubt I will ever return. I don't mind paying $10+ for a burger if it is good quality. Also, way too much gunk on my burger. I like to be able to taste the meat. We shared onion rings. They were wet with grease but they didn't taste greasy nor did they give me stomach issues later. I'm more a fan of batter dipped rings than breaded but I liked these."}
{"text":"Had the zinburger: manchego  cheese and braised onions. I skipped the mayo, but added bacon.

The burger was good. Nothing to knock your socks off... Umami in LA is still my favorite of favorites. 

If you happen to be at The Biltmore Fashion Park... give it a try... no need to go out of your way...."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers that one expects there to be more burgers given the menu-but that helped to make my decision easier. If you want more options, you could go for the plain burger and add on different fixings that you wanted.

I had the Sinburger (bacon, thousand island and cheddar-?), but I added avocado--yum!!

We had the truffle fries which were decadent. Overall, this was a nice lunch and reminded me of the Counter (which is a good thing!)."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes. Then was dropped from their text alert system. Sorry they said. What happened?   Another 40 minutes. So we waited twice as long and then this happens. Table sat next to us were seated after us and served first by waitress. We were laughing at this point because its how we deal with anger.Root beer instead of diet coke. Was it ever going to end? Manager I believe came by but why bother saying anything when your entire front of house already made me never want to come by here again. Never again unless a manager notifies me via Yelp. All of us live right down the street which is a shame.  If u want to wait for a chance to become frustrated come by Zinburger in Gilbert! Going into the night I was happy and this place made me upset. A restaurant should never be able turn the tide of happiness from positive to negative but they accomplished it. Therefore this establishment gets my solid one star review on service and two star on food because eating angry doesn't jive."}
{"text":"Great place for burger. It is a game changer for all burger places. The only thing is that the burger doesn't come with fries. The beer selection is great.
I would recommend the Diablo burger. Or the Bruce Lee."}
{"text":"Ok, so, we creep into the joint on a Saturday. Place is kinda packed, not too many fedoras and under armor shirts around so i am pleased. I order the breakfast burger because i was hung over from a night of drinking hundreds of very expensive bud lights. The lady gets something i don't even remember. The couple we are with got some other shit i don't remember either. This is a review about me, who cares about them? Any who, i get my grub and realize i need ranch because i am a disgusting pig that enjoys the good things in life. The waitress comes out and spills the ranch all over the wife and the couple which was funny. Not a single drop on me, or my burger. So now I'm depressed because all i want is some damn ranch for my meat....24 seconds later, the other ranch has come out. I dunk my burger in it and go from zero to midnight. It was killer. All in all not bad. Oh btw, my buddy i was with walked in on a couple banging in the toilet. Dead serious. Go check it out."}
{"text":"Expensive. Over priced and overrated. $10 for a burger with no side. I ordered the actual zin burger which I did not like due to the goats cheese. Did a \" make your own burger\" with cheddar. Good but not worth $9.50."}
{"text":"Located in a beautiful shopping mall. Busy during lunch, took a seat out in the patio to avoid waiting for a table inside. Server was very generous and did a good job serving our table. I got the El Diablo burger for 10.50. Really good but a bit dry for me. Didn't come with fries so don't except any. Overall, it was a good treat. Zinburger' not bad. I will be back to try some of their other burger creations! Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm very glad that I gave Zinburger a second chance... they have certainly redeemed themselves.

On our first visit (with the 4-year-old, mind you), we were told the wait was 5-10 minutes... 25 minutes later, we were finally sat... with an incredibly annoyed child in tow.  We didn't have the greatest service (slow, forgotten items, etc), and I was shocked by the high price tag of a child's meal.  I really wish that they would put this on the menu... I definitely would have just shared my own burger with the kid, if I had realized!  HOWEVER - the Creme Brulee shake was just incredible.  The light dusting of salty goodness on top just sends it over the edge!  

Since the shake was so unbelievable, I decided to give Zinburger another chance last night.  My sister and I were seated after a very short wait (appropriately estimated this time - improvement noted!), and our lovely waitress, Nikki, overheard me relaying my first experience to my sister.  Much to our surprise, our waitress had the manager, Danielle, come over and chat with us about our previous experience... and she graciously comp'd our divine milkshake.  Now, THIS is a way to change slightly irritated customers into raving fans.  I loved that they took the time to acknowledge my concerns and went to extra lengths to make sure I was satisfied.  

I will definitely return - as soon as I need a \"fix\" of milkshakes and yummy burgers."}
{"text":"We came back and brought reinforcements!!  430pm on Wed much better than 2pm on a sunny spring Sunday!  Happy Hour Gin and Tonics and Sangrias delivered promptly with a smile.  HH Ziniburgers just the right size and perfectly cooked according to order!  Zucchini fries worth ordering on their own.  Boy, do I wish they had garlic fries.  Food was all delicious and well prepared, service was fast, friendly and accurate.  Why not 5 stars?  LOUD music!!!  People talking loudly over it.  By 530, was an absolute DIN!  Fun, lively atmosphere, but room is a big box, so that is just what it sounds like.  We will be back when we're hungry for a great burger and friendly smiles."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Quick and friendly service. Food was delicious and not too pricey. Meat was tender and tasty + soft bun=perfect combo. Recommend."}
{"text":"Ask yourself: is the food good? 
Answer: Yes

Ask yourself: is the food worth a 1.5-2 hour wait?
Answer: Absolutely not. 

Every time we have eaten here (maybe 3-5 times) there's been a wait of at least 1.5-2.5 hours which is ridiculous. The worst of it is, both the app and the hostess will say \"the wait is 30-45 minutes\"

The last couple of times we waited, we sat outside and saw people leaving; a handful of tables here and there. Meanwhile, the waitlist said there are only 5 people ahead of you. 

Your stomach grumbles. You think to yourself, \"gee, I sure am hungry. Shouldn't be long now. Being that five people are in front of me and three tables have left.\"

Then you see three tables get sat. But your waitlist count doesn't move. 

I don't know how their \"system\"' works there but it's flawed. To the point that my husband and I would rather go to a McD's for a Big Mac then sit and wait for two hours while other people eat the food we've been waiting for. 

People, who I couldn't help but notice, were added to the wait list after us, and sat long before us. 

Just know, whatever they say your wait is, you'll be waiting 2-3x that, easy. So don't go hungry. As a matter of fact? Don't go at all. 

As I write this, it has been 2 hours since my husband and I were added to the waitlist. Five people are still ahead of us, and half an hour ago we left and have already ordered at a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Zinburger might be one of my favorite places.  If only my wallet loved it as much as I do.  The hamburgers and chicken sandwiches are huge and delicious.  The truffle fries are magical, especially with the dipping sauce.  I have only had milkshake, but it was creamy, thick, and chocolately.  I like the idea of being able to have wine or beer or a milkshake or all three with a burger.  I love the bar, which is massive and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  I also enjoy the giant pasture painted on the wall with the signature cows.  My gripe with Zinburger is, of course, it is pricey.  To get a milkshake, burger, and fries, you are looking at spending $25 and that's without tip.  Yikes.  Now if you come with a friend or date, you can split shakes and fries to make the price less sticker shock.  Zinburger is definitely one of the few restaurants that makes me wish I had a sugar daddy."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries I've had in Arizona by far.  

The Bruce Lee burger (medium rare) won some award and it was much deserved. Soooo juicy and delicious. I got the truffle fries for everyone to share. The fries came with a white sauce that compliment the perfectly salted fries. 

I went here for a young professional meetup with 12 others. Parking was only free for 2 hours. I think I was there for a total of 4 hour but paid $2 for the additional time I was there after parking validation. Service to large group was phenomenal. I hear their shakes are to die for. I'll have to try that when I go back for more."}
{"text":"We both ordered the Hava Chicken Sandwich and split the Zucchini Fries with parm and ranch. Atmosphere was great- patio seating but food took 30 minutes to come out from time of order and fries came out 5 minutes later. Felt a little rushed out but food was very tasty and well prepared. Fries were a little soggy but probably the way they were supposed to be. Never had them before. Asked server to bring more lemons for the water and she never brought them. She clearly forgot as she brought the bill 10 minutes later and didn't mention it. All in all I would come back hoping for better service next time."}
{"text":"Picking a burger place for a light lunch is not necessarily the best choice, but that is where I ended up, with the hopes of splitting a burger with someone. We were seated fast, and they had plenty of room on their patio area to eat outside. Our waitress was quick with our drinks while we looked over the menu. There were so many good looking burgers here. And we all ended up getting our own because I didn't want to share what the other person was getting. I wanted to build my own, a turkey burger patty with goat cheese and bacon. It was a goooood decision. I still took half of it back to our hotel in a small to go box, and the table shared the truffle fries. They weren't amazing fries, but they were still good. Our waitress was quick to refill our drinks, and the staff was very accommodating when another large table wanted to be moved inside because a bird was hanging out to close to them for their comfort (its outside, where there are occasional food scraps, what did they expect). There is not a Zinburger anywhere near me normally, but if you are in the Scottsdale are, this is definitely a good place for a burger."}
{"text":"Friendliest hostesses
Food is great try the Ringer and zucchini fries
Always take a shake to go
Service has never disappointed"}
{"text":"Came in for HH with a friend. Got there about 430 and was able to find 2 seats at the bar.  They had 1/2 off wine and beer and sides. We were able to sit for a few hours without being bothered even though it was getting busy, which was nice. We did order a turkey burger and a side of loaded fries that were ridiculously good!  The service was kind of slow and the bartender was hard to get a hold of but overall it was a good experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town by far.  I am a gourmet food salesman and these guys do not buy from me so it pains me to admit it, but the burger is second to none.  Believe it.  I had the kobe burger, out of this world."}
{"text":"Burger perfection!

BIG burger perfection! Split it with a friend or go when you're extremely hungry! 

Great shakes, too!

Personally, I'm torn on \"Best Burger\" between this place and the Grind. 
They're different, which is good. 

Friendly staff and a clean, airy atmosphere add to the experience...

It's pricey, but you get a heck of a burger for the buck!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this because I love Fox Concepts restaurants but Zinburger has been my biggest disapointment of the places I have dined since I moved here.  My boyfriend and I were looking for a great burger place for a date and my friend suggested this place.  

For starters, our server was terrible!  I have been a server before and I understand that sometimes bad things happen at certain table throughout the night but wow girlfriend, serving is not for you.  The girl brought us a completely wrong meal the first time and forgot what we ordered.  When we waited for our actual meals to be brought out she still forgot the bacon on my burger and my boyfriends sweet potato fries.  MY boyfriend never got his requested sauces, no water refills, etc-disaster.  At the end the server ended up charging me for a Kobe burger (which I did not order and is more expensive) and did not apologize for any of the mistakes.

I ordered my burger medium and got it raw.  Trust me I like things a little on the rare side but this wasnt edible.  I ordered fresh mozzarella on my burger hoping for a nice thick creamy slice of cheese and I swear I got 1 slice of kraft singles.  The truffle fries were good.

Like I said before I love Fox Concepts and I usually dont rate places very bad but this place was not good and not what I was expecting.  I would have rather had a BK burger."}
{"text":"The staff and atmosphere are the big positives here; food; \"eh\" just average for me, which makes it an overpriced option for a burger and fries in my estimation. Nothing stands out as excellent to me in the food department."}
{"text":"This place hits a home run every time I visit it. I've eaten here 5 times now and never once felt any of my food was less than very good! As a matter of fact, it's the memories of this location that seems to always take me to other locations that carry the Zinburger name just believing the chain may be consistent. Turns out they are just as individual as the person/persons running the kitchen.  This location delivers very good fare in my estimation, and it's consistently very good too!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but the burgers are so good,the meat is so fresh.  Onion rings rock. Had a long wait but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Bad experience got there and was told 20 to 30 min. wait, 30 min. later we check to see how much longer and they didn't have us on the list at all. Then they offered to put us back on the list but it would be another 20 min. we stupidly agreed, 30 min later we gave up and left. It was hot inside disorganized and very frustrating to wait an hour and never even get to sit down. No burger is that good WILL NEVER GO BACK ! my advise don't waist your time with this place,"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today after driving by, great looking place right in the heart of downtown Gilbert.  While it was busy, I found a open seat sitting outside at the bar. Typically when dinning at the bar, you'd expect to get top notch service. However this was certainly lacking here. I spent 20 minutes trying to get a bartender to take my drink order, then another 20 minutes to actually get someone to take food order...   Once my order was taken, my food came out quickly and the burger I ordered, el Diablo, was actually quite good, and perfectly cooked. 

The couple that sat next to me, also first timers, also had a bad experience too and said they wouldn't be back... It's too bad, great food but terrible service...."}
{"text":"Zinburger's turkey burger is one of if not the best turkey burger I have had.  I started eating turkey burgers a few months ago searching for the best one and I think I have finally found it.  Highly recommend.  I have had their other burgers and never been disappointed.  Furthermore they have a bacon bloody mary this is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Soooo here's the thing. Food is great, service not so good. I understand Friday night are busy and I understand there will be a wait. However the hostess sat several tables before me that arrived after my party had. I work in a restaurant and know the system that they use for check in. While I confronted the hostess I saw that the waitlist name for me had been cancelled. She offered no apology and told me we were next. We had been sitting next to the host stand for a good 30 minutes and they didn't seem to notice that we were waiting? With four hostesses on staff you think at least one would notice. The server was nice but service was still kind of slow. The manager not once stopped by our table to check on us or apologize since he knew we had been skipped. When the food came out one of my guests didn't get extra bacon added on as asked for. Once we we were paying the server took a long time to come back and run the cards. If you want to eat here I would recommend sitting at the bar, they have a much better sense of urgency. Coming from the industry the experience was disappointing as whole especially with the amount of staff working.

Experience: 5/5 at 7:30pm"}
{"text":"First time at this burger outpost in Phoenix and the results were positive. They did have a nice $10 lunch special that included a basic burger, some fries and drink. I opted for the signature burger with manchego cheese and braised onions and mayo on a soft bun. That cheese melted perfectly and the beef was soft, but well done and each bite was very tasty with the flavor combinations. The only miss was the side order of zucchini fries which needed to be more crispy. Nobody likes a limp fry, but otherwise a good burger and good lunch. They validate also."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a kid-free lunch date today.  Wanted to try somewhere we've never been before. 
The place is nice, I love the open windows and doors, especially since the weather in AZ is perfect right now. 
We didn't have a wait, and it appeared to be a busy lunch time.
The server made a big deal of how the meat was ground in house.  Great.  But that doesn't make up for all the canned and jarred sauces, cheese and jarred pickles. 
I appreciated the basic menu.  Too much on the menu tells me that a place doesn't have a specialty.  It's clear that Zinburger has it down, simple is better.
We shared the loaded fries, which were okay  For $7 I thought maybe the pile could have been a little bigger.  But they were tasty.
I ordered the Zinburger and my husband ordered the Ringer.  The taste was delicious.  But the burgers/buns were so soggy.  It was a mess.  Mine basically disintegrated with the first bite and I spent the rest of my meal trying to salvage what resembled a burger.  
I ordered a beer, which turned out to be a $5 can of beer, they even brought me the can to pour myself.  
Our bill was about $45 for 2 burgers, 2 beers and the fries.  A lot more than I'd like to spend on a weekend lunch.  Worth it?  hmmmm...not so sure.  
I'm not into the trendy new fads, I want my meals to be good and worth the money spent.  I like the concept of Zinburger, but not sure if it's worth it for me."}
{"text":"I love zinburger. They used to have this really good turkey sloppy joe but I think they discontinued it, I think they should bring it back! Great burgers and fries, great ambiance, cool bar, convenient location. I strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a blue cheese burger with fries... absolutely delicious. Friendly fast service, although I just ordered to-go. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This location is in the new area of Gilbert. It's lovely and I am so glad all the new places opened.

I came in for happy hour and sat on the patio. The patio is large with plenty of seating. 

The happy hour is totally worth coming for. Half off sides, wine, and beer, making them very inexpensive! The zucchini fries are delicious and make you *think* you are being healthy. I love Mac and cheese and have eaten an unmeasurable amount of pounds of it in my life. I would pass on the Mac and cheese here if you are a true Mac and cheese lover like myself. It's very bland."}
{"text":"Great food! The ZinBurger with grilled onions sautéed in Zinfandel wine - is a great burger as is the Black and Blue burger. The onion rings are crunch, flavorful and very tasty as are the loaded fries and sweet potato fries. Even the fried zucchini fries are tasty. The salted caramel shake is a nice end to the meal. They also have a nice bar. There is always a wait, but the food is always good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I love their burgers.  I love their french fries, I love their zucchini fries.  Service is good each visit.  The employees here have a great attitude."}
{"text":"The Ringer burger is the best! Had it with no bun and it was still delicious. The burgers at Zinburger never disappoint. Great burger spot."}
{"text":"Burgers are tasty. So are the zucchini fries! Happy hour is always a great option here if you can make the times.
Can have a very long wait on the weekends though."}
{"text":"Monday night was a big one for me.  First, after a weekend of cajoling and bartering and promises and pleas, my wife finally relented and allowed me to waste tons of money we don't have on two shiny new iPhones.  So we were at biltmore and were reeling from the precipitous drop in our financial resources and, like the good consumers we are, decided to ease the hurt of one bad decision by hurriedly taking on another one. 

So we went to zinburger.  I could fill a book with the rationalizations used to convince myself and others that the iPhone purchase was a sensible one, but for food, all we needed to know was that our son was hungry. 

Sooo.  We went here and I am thrilled we did because I have probably never had a more delightful burger ever.  The eponymous burger comes with manchego cheese, which always makes me long for Barcelona, and carmelized onions.  Oh, and the moistest, succulentest, tastiest patty ever.  It was falling apart out of sheer goodness.  The flavor was sublime. 

We also got a fruit plate for my son, The One, the Second Coming, and it was a fruit plate worthy of his amazingness.  It had apples, dates, oranges, pomegranates, bananas, caramel sauce... and not a melon in sight.  For $3!!

My wife got the vegetarian burger and looked pleased with it.  Well she actually said she liked it.  It had a tomato marmalade on a black bean patty and after making her forfeit all she knew to be good and right just so I could have my phone, I didn't have the heart to ask for a bite. 

Really though, the food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Delicious milkshakes, tasty sweet potato fries, and a fun take on the tradition hamburger.
I am not one to even step foot inside of a burger joint. However, Zinburger offers a chicken or turkey patty substitute for any beef patty, at no extra cost. Which is totally awesome! These Zinburgers are very large and have 5+ toppings on each burger.. which for me, is just too many toppings to comfortably eat. So I did the \"Build Your Own\" (for $8.50) and totally loved it! Their meats are tender and their ingredients are crisp and fresh! My husband got the Bruce Lee burger and he absolutley loved it too. For me though, Zinburgers sweet potato fries and onion rings are my overall favorite thing to eat here. (One fry can be shared between 2 people easily) their milkshakes are awesome too. If you request two milkshake flavors like oreo and butterfinger they will mix them for you.. and let me tell you custom milkshake creations are awesome. Overall, Zinburger is a fun, yummy, new age burger stop to hangout with friends and watch some sports game on the big screen."}
{"text":"Normally I eat in the restaurant, but this time I ordered to go because I had to head to work.  (Service in the restaurant has always been excellent for me.)

Just to let you know, I love Zinburger. But I think I just happened to pick a bad day. Got to my desk and started to eat...but there was a few problems.... no sauce for the fries (pus they were soggy because they weren't vented for the heat), no napkins, and the burger was not cooked the way I had asked. 

MAJOR Kudos to Tim the manager...after I called he took care of the problem.  He handled the issue promptly, and professionally, so a continued five service stars from me  to Tim and Zinburger."}
{"text":"Good was delicious and the shakes are to die for! Service was great, but larger parties may have a delay, so be prepared. Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Less than impressed for the price. I dont really understand the hype. Honestly the best part was the milkshake. Whats that tell ya?"}
{"text":"We shared the Mac and cheese burger. It was the weekly special. Delicious! We also had the fries and a salted caramel shake... Yummy:) Zinburger has the best burgers. We will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Even though we are loyal Delux clients...we tried Zinburger cause I have heard amazing raves from friends. Short wait which was nice...our waiter was a total grump though. He could have at leased faked one smile. Our burgers were actually really good! The sweet potato fries not so much. Delux fries are wayyy better."}
{"text":"My order never came out so I got to watch my party eat and I got nothing. They tired to sit us in a crappy seat and when we asked for the booth they implied it was saved. Then they finally sit us in booth.  I won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times but I'm finally getting around to reviewing this place. Had to run to Suit Supply today because my boyfriend lost some weight and needed his pants taken in - lucky duck... So we decided to grab lunch while we were at the Quarter. 

We sat at the bar and the bartender was very personable and nice. I think her name was Danielle or Daniela. 

Instead of getting a burger today or the amazing veggie burger, I went with the farm salad with chicken (and no feta cheese). Honestly, my favorite veggie burger is found at this place but I was in the mood for something refreshing and light. I may or may not have scarfed down some French fries with ranch too... 

My boyfriend got the burger of the week. It was a beef patty, Swiss cheese (he went with American cheese instead), pastrami and 1000 island sauce - all on marble rye toast. It was perfect for him because he loves all of those ingredients and said it was pretty tasty. One of us usually tries the burger of the week. I had an Asian BBQ burger there once and I think they named it the Bruce Lee burger. It was awesome! Brian got their fried chicken sandwich once and said he really enjoyed it. 


Wish I could tell you about their milkshakes but I'm really trying to cut down on desserts since we have a Mexico trip around the corner! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Burgers were mediocre, at best. The fries were just soggy and bad. The service was awful - the server didn't listen to our request and we didn't see her once after we received our food. On the plus side, the atmosphere was pretty good. Definitely the worst of all of the Fox restaurants. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Simple: great service, delicious food, nice drink selection, and a lovely patio.

We enjoyed a jalapeño burger, a chicken sandwich (both from the HH menu) as well as zucchini fries. Everything was great. Service was outstanding-- attentive, low key, and helpful info."}
{"text":"My wife goes on streaks where she craves a certain food.  For the last 6 (yes 6!) months we have been to Zinburger at least 3 times a month to order the Ahi Tuna sandwich. It is excellent. We also love the Zuchini fries and the farmhouse salad but above all we love the great service we get from the staff that works there. I am one to ask peoples names so shout outs to Tiffany our server tonight and also her manager Steffi. On several other occasions we have had great service from Brendan and Tony at the bar and of course our favorite server/manager Greg.  Keep up the smiles. Jack"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go eat. We are always seated immediately if there is a table open or at least greeted immediately. I love the burgers and fries, (loaded fries and zucchini fries are delicious), but absolutely love their salted caramel shake. We have always had great service, great food, & appreciate that we can take our children here with us as well."}
{"text":"Zinburger gets a 5 star review for the burger, banana cream pie, but most importantly Mallory's service! She was friendly, enthusiastic, and very on point with service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I liked Zinburger, but did think it was a little overpriced since the burgers don't come with fries. The food was good. I had the chicken sandwich, thought the bun was really delicious and ate the whole thing. My boyfriend tried the Sam burger with bacon and thousand island + american cheese and said it was very good. We did start with the zucchini fries even though we thought it was a rip. They were pretty good but nothing amazing, certainly for paying five or six bucks. 

We were having a little bit of a Saturday Funday and so I drank a girl next door (pink and fun, really good), and my boyfriend had the margarita, which was also yummy. Both drinks were beautifully served. 

Also, I want to mention that the waitresses at this restaurant were doing a really good job. I would even say, a stand-out-good-job.

I'm a big fan of FRC and so as usual, this restaurant did not disappoint."}
{"text":"The staff was kind and inviting not one sourpuss! Best happy hour ever! Cheap draft beer ! Cheap sides and burger! Burger was scrumptious! I added on bacon and egg because I was feeling breakfasty! I also washed it down with a 20 ounce draft beer. I was so incredibly full I didn't have any room for dessert. 

The only downside is that they don't have any kids coloring menu. This is not a huge no no. It's just nice to have distractions for little ones."}
{"text":"Oh just thinking about this place makes me hungry!  I had never been to a Zinburger before last week and now I want to go every day.  DELICIOUS hamburgers.  Amazing zucchini fries.  Fantastic service.  I would give this place a 10, but we're only allowed to rate it to a 5.  ASK for April as your server.  She has an awesome sense of humor and is a wonderful server."}
{"text":"Situated snug in the middle of the Biltmore Fashion Park, Zinburger has become the spot for fun, hip, milkshake and burger eating delights. While I've been there four times now (once just for the Black Lager Float) I have to say that every trip has led to a very delicious experience. 

Last night's order: Samburger with a fried egg. So I've had this burger  before, but without the egg... let me just say, I don't think I can order this sandwich without the egg anymore.. it made it that much better.  But that's just me. I'm into eggy things (almost as much as I'm into smoked meats and cheeses.. but I'll save that for another day.. BTW.. is there a Salumi place anywhere in Phoenix?)

Side wise, I've had the regular fries, the truffle fries, the sweet potato fries, and the zucchini fries... all very good and seasoned well. To make your meal more interactive and fun.. get your fries as a semi-appetizer that lingers around just long enough to say 'Hi' to the burgers as they come out. Otherwise.. you'll be waiting around while your beef gets cooked up.

If I had to give one negative remark, it would have to be regarding the wine selection. For a joint that actively says.. \"Hey.. we do burgers and wine\"... I'd have to say the job of Zinburger's sommelier is rather dull. Would you like to spend 5 bucks.. or 7 bucks? (I'm partly exaggerating)

Overall, the burgers are good, the fries are good.. and the wine.. well who drinks wine with burgers unless you're trying to make yourself look more sophisticated then you actually are. Just kidding, I love you, you know that right?"}
{"text":"Large room atmosphere and friendly staff. Food is good and milkshakes are delicious. Ok kids menu, and they have happy hour on drinks and appetizers. Looking for basics? Try the zinburger. They have a veggie burger which is actually really good too. Decent parking nearby, expect a wait during peak time. Full bar too. We had great service last time we went here."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and still haven't found a burger that I love. I tried the Zinburger, el Diablo, and the Ringer. One thing I liked is that you can add fried egg on top of your burger which I recommend. But even with that, I still needed something more out of my burger. It looked better than it tasted. I was a little but disappointed since  I love Fox restaurants -- but this just wasn't doing it for me. It was good but not amazing. I do recommend the salted caramel shake though, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Zinburger is solid restaurant. My fiance and I sat outside and the atmosphere was great. The burger was alright, but the highlight of the meal was the \"loaded fries\" and the milkshake. I would be back to maybe try another choice on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food! I got the bacon cheeseburger and fries one time, another time was a veggie burger. A few friends raved about the turkey burger too. The service is good, very friendly. And they have gluten free buns. I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Zinburger is an interesting concept. I like the idea of an upscale burger joint coupled with a full bar. The look and feel of the place is casual and hip, with the clientele being mostly hipster/yuppies and business people. Although I am neither, I didn't feel entirely out of place. Maybe that was because of the friendly staff -- when people are nice and friendly to you, it always leaves a good, lasting impression. And, the one person that was utterly delightful and charming was the bartender.  I wish I remembered his name because I was quite smitten by him. His efficiency and friendliness only made the meal that much better. 

And the meal, at least mine, was descent. I had the turkey burger, and being the seeker of great turkey burgers, I'd say this one was right in the middle.  For my taste, it needed a little bit more flavor to it. But what the turkey burger lacked, the sweet potato fries made up for.  You can't beat a flavorful sweet potato fry for anything! Despite my average feelings towards my meal, my mom truly enjoyed her BLT salad. It was the perfect side for her, and she said she really loved the salad dressing. 

Zinburger has a lot of what I look for in a restaurant experience -- nice staff, cool atmosphere and good food.  If I could, I would give it 3 3/4 stars because it is definitely \"A-OK,\" but I'm not quite yet \"a fan.\" I'll definitely go back again and try some of their other offerings and decide then if I should up it a 1/4 point.  Heck, I may even pull out a fiver!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time coming here and let me say I was impressed! I ordered the Breakfast burger and everything was delicious. Our server was very nice and he was attentive as well. Our order came out at a reasonable time since it was very busy and everything we ordered came out just how we wanted and nothing was returned. No complaints there! I would come back again."}
{"text":"Personally, I did not see what all the hype was about. The food was okay, the service was a B+, the atmosphere was not overly impressive. For a Fox restaurant, I thought it was sub-par. There weren't many menu options, but there were several different kinds of fries to choose from. The cow decor was a little unsettling, especially after just having watched Food, Inc. Probably my first and last trip to Zinburger."}
{"text":"Food was all very good. I'm a vegetarian and loved the veggie burger because it wasn't dry like cardboard. They allow you to customize but offer some good combinations on the menu. For the table we ordered the green chili fries and truffle fries, both were excellent. Our server was very nice, drinks were refilled even before you had to ask. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"I ate here with some friends, none of us knowing anything about it, when we visited Downtown Gilbert. I'm a big burger guy, so I was hoping for something phenomenal- everyone had told me good things. I was very impressed by the classic cheeseburger I had; it was a meal of had before, but done in a fashion that is out of this world. The burger and fries almost won, but I was able to finish. Zinburger doles out hefty portions, that's for sure. 

The only reason I have them four stars was due to the time it took for the order to be ready from when I requested it. It was quite a bit longer than usual. Besides that, everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"I've tried a few local burger places now after living here for about 7 months and this one is my favorite thus far.  Their burgers are flavorful and fresh, the sweet potato fries completely scrumptious, and the potions are generous.

I have tried their Buffalo Chicken sandwich as well as the Plain & Simple Burger.  Both have been more than I can consume, especially with sharing the fries.  I have also heard that the zucchini fries are like a meal within itself and look forward to trying them next time I visit.

We went their for lunch and let me just say that the people watching here is rather amusing... watching an elderly lady eat a burger with a knife and fork and adding ketchup to it with her knife for each individual bite in which she cut away one at a time, was much more refined than I have ever seen anyone consume a burger.  The staff was friendly and attentive despite how occupied it was and tended to our needs accordingly. I look forward to going back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I really liked Zinburger. I went with the El Diablo. It was perfect! No tomatoes, lettuce, fluff! It was all about meat, jalapeños, caramelized onions oozing like a burger should! The truffle fries were yum as well...addicting I'd say!
We also got a butterfinger shake, and they were nice enough to split it into 2 glasses. One for the kids and one for mom and dad to share! Of course the shake was great too!"}
{"text":"It seems that burgers are all the rage right now. Burger joints are popping up all over the Valley. I had heard great things about Zinburger, including from my Tucson in-laws, so my husband and I decided to try the place out. 
We arrived at Zinburger at about 7pm on a Saturday night. The place was packed so we grabbed a beer to wait by the bar. Two seats opened up at the bar and we decided to have our dinner there. It was a bit too loud to really have a conversation with the bartenders if we wanted to, plus they seemed very busy, so we looked over the menu and with the recommendation help of some of my Twitter friends, we made a decision on our meal. My husband and I decided to split the Zinburger and the Turkey Burger with a side of Zucchini fries and sweet potato fries. I drank a Widmer and hubby had a couple glasses of Tobin James Zinfandel. A really yummy, jammy inexpensive wine. Our fries came out first and they zucchini fries were fantastic. The sweet potato fries were \"so-so\" and the dipping sauce that accompanied them had to of been a mistake. It tasted like a cucumber sauce for a Gyro. Our burgers came out and all I gotta say is DELISH. Wow. I wasn't sure about having a turkey burger for dinner, but it was fantastic. Lots of flavor from the garlic in the meat mixture. I wish my hubby had ordered it with the mayo, but it was darn good. The signature burger is the Zinburger and it definitely was tasty. Super savory and juicy from the Manchego Cheese & Zinfandel Braised Onions. I wasn't thrilled to eat warm, super soggy shredded lettuce on the burger though. They should take that off or maybe use an iceberg leaf.
All in all, great burgers. In fact, I now think the Zinburger is my favorite burger. That honor used to go to Delux.
Oh, if you do decide to get some wine, be careful. They charged $10 for a glass of the Tobin James Zinfandel.  You can get a bottle of that for about $12-$13 at Cost Plus, etc. The mark up on the glasses of wine are ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. We were there recently and sat on the patio. We hardly saw our server and waters didn't get refilled. I don't blame her because I saw her at other tables inside so I think she was given too many tables, spread apart, to give good service. That's poor station design. Their stations/tables should be in one area close together so they can give proper service. But again the food is good and we will be back!"}
{"text":"As far as gourmet burger joints go, this place is the bomb! I am a huge fan of Deluxe Burger and now they have a run for their money! Plus the parking is much easier at Zinburger. I had the Zinburger, and we shared sweet potato fries and regular fries. Everything was delicious! All 3 of had the Zinburger, so not much variety at our table, but we all finished our burgers, and given the size of them, I was pretty surprised/impressed with all of us. The burger was heavenly, juicy and cooked perfectly. I would definitely go back, again and again!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This place has the best grilled cheese. Your service is great as it gets! I recommend this place because everything there seems to fit all together. Another great thing is, if every table is occupied, if you have a kid, they could play in the splash pad. This place is also close to the great It`s sugar, and Le macaroon. If you are reading this review, I beg you to go to this place."}
{"text":"I'm glad we called ahead for a reservation, cuz this place was packed! I ordered a beer while our booth was prepared, and by the time it arrived we were already being seated. It was nice that a high chair was offered for the toddler in our group, but I was surprised they didn't have any crayons or a kids menu to color on.  We chose Zin as a family friendly option and this is really the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars. Maybe a little picky... The burgers and fries were excellent, and I was also impressed with the beer and wine menu. Deschutes Fresh squeezed for this guy, but plenty of other options I would have been happy with. A basket of fries is more than enough to share between two people, so keep that in mind unless you're really hungry! I didn't have room for dessert myself, but the chocolate shake at the table next to us looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Different burgers to choose from, Turkey,  chicken,  veggie, and beef. Tried the chicken fried chicken, salted caramel shake,  and loaded fries and it was all delicious. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a little overpriced for burgers but it is not out of the norm compared to other joints like this ie; Coal Burger, Modern Burger, etc...

We have eaten here two times. Both times I ordered the Zinburger sub the veggie patty and add truffle aioli. Both times it was great. I will admit our first visit we each ordered a side of fries which was way too much food. One order is enough to split between two people. The milkshakes are stellar and are alone worth the trip to Biltmore.

Definitely expect a wait if you go during the weekend. Other than watching others get to eat before you, I have no complaints. Good service, good food, good restaurant!"}
{"text":"We came here from out of town and it popped up near us.  Best decision we made. We were seated after a 5 minute wait and arrives during happy hour. We took advantage of that menu.  We each got a different burger and they were all amazing. The fried were perfectly cooked and the handcrafted sodas were delicious. If we are ever in town again we will be stopping in."}
{"text":"I had the Bruce lee, medium rare and I loved it so much!!! I honestly could've eaten another burger to myself and would've been okay. I wish the burgers automatically did come with fries. That just seems like a standard at most burger places.  I ordered zucchini fries which were SUPER GOOD!!!! Definitely will be back to try another burger and maybe a shake!"}
{"text":"We let the kids choose a place to eat dinner tonight and they chose Zinburger.  This is our 6th or 7th time eating here.  Three of us got burgers while the youngest got grilled cheese.  The food took forever to come out (the wife and I each sipped down nearly an entire 20oz beer before the food showed up) .  We watched a table of 6 people sit down after us and eat before us.  Our drinks took a very long time as well.  The kids sat with empty cups for 10 minutes after the waitress asked if they wanted refills.  I guess plastics cups full of soda take time?  She kept apologizing about the delay in service saying it was busy, but we had a hard time accepting that.  There were empty tables all around and no one waiting at this point...

Now on to the burgers.  

Good:  They were tasty!  My boy blue offers a very generous amount of blue cheese which makes that burger in my opinion.  The samburger is also another go-to, I'm a sucker for thousand islands and bacon.  Finally, the ringer.  Franks red hot and onion rings on a burger. Yes please! 

Not so good:  The execution.  Here's where I have a big issue.  When you ask someone how they would like their  burger cooked, they say medium, and you say \"that's warm and pink throughout\" and they say \"perfect\", that's what you should bring them!  Not to mention, all three of us got medium doneness, we all heard each other say it, we all heard her response, yet she kept repeating the same line about what to expect the burger to look like when we bite into it.  Like a robot.  Fast forward, burgers come out...  All well-done.  Well, we tried...  Again.  We have never once, in the history of eating at Zinburger, ever received a burger cooked to our request!  Medium is not something crazy.  If you're a burger place, with a menu mostly full of burgers, with the word burger in your name, you should execute them perfectly!  The burgers should be cooked to the customers request each and every time.  Otherwise, save your line about what the burger should look like.  You're just leading us on!  You've been open for a while now.  The burger doneness thing should have been figured out a long time ago.  It's unacceptable to me at this point.  We're going to hit up all the new places down in that area before coming back, if we decide to come back..."}
{"text":"Good food here plus they have gluten free fries and buns so great for us. I had the Bruce Lee burger on a gluten free bun and it was tasty."}
{"text":"Kobe burger with truffle fries...awesome! They grind fresh daily and it taste like it. Look out smash burger this place is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"One of the fox concept restaurants was recommended to me by my friends who used to live in Arizona. We checked out Zinburger and it did not disappoint! We started off with zucchini fries and the truffle fries. The zucchini fries were moist and lightly fried--I can eat them everyday! I had a turkey burger and it was surprisingly moist. I've had many other turkey burgers that have been slightly dry in the past but this burger was delicious. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time here and I must say, this place rocks. I'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts and as always with their restaurants, I was impressed. The burger was cooked perfectly (I asked for medium), and was super juicy! I had their Hawaiian burger that was on special and I'm only disappointed that it's not on there regular menu because I would love to get it again next time. The service was great too, very attentive and a decent size drink menu as well. 
The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it would've been nice if fries or some sort of side came with the burgers instead of a la carte. Either way I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first time here and I thought it was pretty good. I would definitely come back to get a second opinion on their food though. The presentation was really good. This place is also a good place to go for socializing with friends. It's an open spacious atmosphere, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week and got in on the special deal. I had the \"sam burger\" and my wife had the zinburger. Funny thing, either my wife was extremely hungry or it was the best hamburger of her life. You have to understand my wife, she takes her time when she eats, savors the moment, and enjoys it from start to finish. Well needless to say before I was half way done with my burger, she had completed hers. I felt like I was in the twilight zone or something, that just doesnt happen her finishing before me!

I found the hamburger to be the 'right size'. It wasnt too  big, not too small. I felt comfortably full after everything.

The creme brulee shake was very good. I could only get through about 3/4 of it. I definately will be visiting it again. Nice trick with the mirror giving the illusion of the place is bigger than it seems. Took me a minute to figure out it was a mirror, and not part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I like the fact that we could check in early via yelp! Thank you!!
The iced tea was very good
We were not too happy that ZERO sides came with the $10-$16 burgers!
So we decided to split a chopped wedge salad...they kindly split at no charge.
We also ordered our burgers and onion rings at the same time. We specifically said Salad first then the rest together please. about 5 minutes later someone tried to bring us onion rings, I rejected them and that server looked at me like I was crazy but took them back. A moment later the manager came out and said \"we will make you some fresh onion rings and send them out with your burgers\"...My husband and I joked and were like...we certainly hoped so...
A few minutes later our salad came...I honestly think it was the best part of my meal...
then a little later our meal presented it self, as ordered, yay! Like I said, the burgers were pretty good...but not $15 each good...they were average size...no amazing toppings...no amazing plating... 
Now, about the onion rings...they tasted like burger king onion rings...GROSS!!! Hello, you have like 6 sides on your menu...can't you make FRESH onion rings?

I will continue to go to BurgerFi...Much Better burgers, fries and onions at half the price! I am sad, I wanted to like this place as I love most of the restaurants down here in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I was shopping in the Scottsdale quarter and thought I'd pick up my husband a burger for dinner. I ordered him a Kobe burger and he liked it . and would go back for another. Which was great because I loved the farm fresh salad. So fresh and I loved the tiny chopped squares of veggies. Radishes, cucumber, tomatoes, onions. Also had corn, feta. A little field greens. Sooo good. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time at Zinburger; had a party of 4 on Friday; had to wait about 15 minutes; just what the hostess had said, I like that!!!  Now, the food; simple menu; but I got the speciality the Zinburger, but got mushrooms instead of grilled onion; delicious - it was cooked to perfection.  One of  my friends got the Samburger, he really seemed to enjoy it.  Another friend got the turkey burger; someone that has been to Zinburger before and told us what sides to order; devoured his turkey burger in no time flat.  Our other friend who only eats fish had the Ahi Sandwich; really enjoyed it.  The sweet potato fries & double truffle fries were awesome.  Also, split the banana creme pie between the 4 of us - YUMMY.  The service was great.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I was really craving a pizza burger and when I asked my waitress if they had it she said no, but that she was willing to go the restaurant next door robust the ingredients to make it for me! I was blown away! Amazing service!"}
{"text":"Ate here on the Friday after Christmas.  Place was packed.  At 5:30, there was an hour wait.  We met some friends and we were seating in the quoted time.  Waitress was pretty good, especially for how busy they were.
We all got burgers.  The burgers were amazing, but for $10 they should be!  Fries are extra.  We got an ordering sweet potato fries, green chili fries, and zucchini fries.  All were good, except the green chili fries didn't seem like anything special.
To finish off the dinner, we order a banana creme pie and the Banana Royal shake.  The pie was ok...not a big fan of creme pie.  The shake was pretty amazing!  More chocolate and banana than I was expecting.  But was SO good!  They are a must from now on.
Overall it was really good.  It was just a little expensive.  I would defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the main Zinburger that I go to and its one of my favorite interiors and atmospheres. The service is friendly and I almost get the same thing every time I'm here. I really enjoy the juicy burgers and it's one of my favorite places to go for one. The fries are also on point with the garlic and original fries."}
{"text":"This is one of my top places to enjoy a well made burger in the valley. I usually go to the Gilbert location but since I was on this side of town, I wanted to take a shot at the Biltmore location. I really enjoyed the garlic fries and their burgers because they're always juicy and never dry. The interior is I think smaller and they have also an outdoor patio seating. I recommend the garlic fries to share with friends and I'm usually a simple person with burgers so I like the classic cheeseburger with bacon."}
{"text":"Had their  daily  special  triple  burger  this was a lot of food  for $12. Definitely  worth  the money .I little  difficult  to eat but it was cooked  perfectly  with two slices of cheese. This is a meal for two . Service  is always  great. Their fries are great especially  the zucchini.  Had a good  time  there"}
{"text":"We gave 5he restaurant  another visit . Parking was a problem  again. . They were busy but was able to get us in quickly.  My daughter  was watching  her calories  and  these were not available.  I asked for the zucchini  fries early but it came with the meals.the waitress wore very short pants which was not endearing  to my family.  The fries were great . I ordered the Diablo  which was to be served with jalapeños  however  they were served  with green chilis, this is not the same . I was expecting  heat.the bread  was nice and soft but was difficult  to cut in half.  .my friends  love this place but my experience  has been disappointing"}
{"text":"I've based my 5 stars on one visit to Zinburger. I had the best turkey burger I've ever had. It was so juicy and delicious. My boyfriend had the Zinburger which he said was also delicious. We also had two shakes. The Zinbar shake was awesome and the bananas foster shake was thick and so yummy! The service was good and the deal (2 burgers & fries for $20) was great! I wish there were a location closer to us in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Disappointed,was one of my favorite places.  The menu has changed a bit.. no kale salad, turkey burger cold.. onion rings not the best..

Not sure if different chef but not my favorite anymore. There are a lot of burger places...  not going back..."}
{"text":"Extremely allergy friendly. Great food, drinks and service. One of my favorite places for gluten-free / Celiac disease."}
{"text":"First time at Zinburger- met my husband and friends for a late Saturday lunch. In fact, I'm still here. Hi ordered the \"samburger\" plain old burger- and it was DELICIOUS. Absolutely great- juicy, flavorful and awesome. The fries were equally as fantastic. Crispy, potato-y, just great. Beer selection is ok- decent, but I'm a total beer snob. 

Then there's the issue of the service. It's definitely busy-ish. Not crazy by any stretch and the service was sub par at best. I got my food before my beer. Like literally 15+minutes to get my beer. Then the server came back and asked me what type of beer I had ordered. oooohhhkay. Just get me my damn beer, hell, any beer would suffice at this point! 

Anyways? I'd give it another go for sure- maybe that particular server was having an off day."}
{"text":"I thought Zinburger at the Biltmore was pretty good. I had decided to make my own burger (havarti and bacon). Unfortunately all sides are extra. I also ordered a Nutella shake which was bomb. I left happy and satisfied"}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's day special, which was a good deal ($40 bucks for 2 burgers, shared side, 2 drinks--included wine and beer!, and dessert).  The burger was just ok, I wasn't crazy about the fries, but my boyfriend liked the fries.  The best part? The dessert! SO GOOD.  The chocolate pie was one of the best desserts I've ever had.  I'd go back just for that... the burger? meh.. there are other good burger places around town.  But I would go back to try the other varieties of burgers.  Fun atmosphere, not-so-friendly hosts, decent service from servers."}
{"text":"YUM, delicious turkey burgers."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers , fries and especially the zucchini fries. The service is great and all in all it's a fun experience"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I participated in Arizona Restaurant Week and loved that we had an opportunity to try this place, 2 for $29! We walked in and had a short wait for a patio table, the hostess seemed pretty unexperienced and when we told her we wanted to walk around while we were waiting she seemed frustrated, handed us a pager and off we went. About 10 minutes later it went started buzzing and we returned to be seated. We ordered waters right away so that we could look at the menu to figure out what we wanted, and waited.. and waited... we actually received our DELICIOUS double truffle fries before our waters. Our server came back over to discover that we had yet to get our drinks and apologized. She was really nice and sincere, so it really didn't bother me. Then we received the seared ahi salad and burger... both were OUTSTANDING and I was pleasantly surprised at how great everything tasted. Not to mention the creme brulee shake & banana creme pie for dessert! YUM! I will be returning soon, please save me a seat on the patio now that the weather is starting to cool down!"}
{"text":"Zinburger is one of those places you have to go to when you are in Phoenix.  The restaurant is right off Camelback across from the Ritz Carlton in the Phoenix financial district (i.e. great location).

The food here is ZINTABULOUS.   My wife and I had the Chicken lettuce burger with Franks Hot Sauce!  Aw yeah, that is awesome!  We also had a burger that was phenomballs and sampled the fried zucchini (which was also absolutely delicious) and threw in the Chili fries just to sample - BWOZA, another winner!!

We took part in the happy hour (before 6 p.m.) which offered some killer pricing and selection, and watched a ball game on tv overlooking the city scene in the background.

The only thing better than the food was the service.  The waitresses and hostesses are so friendly and personable that you feel like you don't want to leave!!!  That is how you do it.  Zinburger is a great place with a great vibe and this is one of my Phoenix Fav's.

Get the chicken sandwich with Franks Hot Sauce and tell em Attorney Steve sent you!

PS.  Our waitress was Kira, ask for her.....she is simply the best!

{"text":"First of all if anyone is complaining about the price of a burger at The Biltmore they shouldn't be allowed at The Biltmore. The prices are comparable to most other restaurants around that area and honestly people go to McDonald's if you don't want to spend the moolah. 

I LOVED it! Coming from someone who used to frequent DELUX, got sick of the same one burger and the fact that the service was rude at the bar. 

Tried out this place on Easter with a couple of friends. The waitress was nice and answered all my high maintenance questions. I used to be a waitress so I know how annoying that is! hahaha. I ordered the Kobe (omg 14 dollars!) had it medium and added goat cheese. The Kobe beef is from Washington not California or Japan..so I don't know what that means when it comes to quality. My friend ordered a standard and put Bacon and Eggs on top! We split the Truffle fries and I had a glass of syrah and he hand a Guinness. 

I LOVE all the extra topping that you can add..there is a charge but they are nice and happy to put whatever you want on the burger..as opposed to other places. 

I ordered the medium, it came out a little more med-rare so if you want a true med I would order a Med-Well. But it was really really good! I ate the whole damn thing! I usually cant finish half! I was amazing! I was super happy with the outcome! And my friend seemed to like his Bacon and Egg burger but I wasn't really paying attention because I was in burger heaven! 

After that I washed down my friens and burger with a strawberry shake...it was good but I was so stuffed I couldn't finish that... 

The bill came out to $50...for 2 drinks, 2 burgers, fries and a milkshake. For that price I would say date night...but definitely worth trying out! 

WAYYYYYYY better the DELUX...and only a mile down the road!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've come here and now the last.

We walked in and it was busy so we put our name on the wait list. We weren't the only people looking for a place to eat. You would think they would bus the tables to try and get people seated. Noooooo. I watched a booth for a full 6 minutes before any waitstaff even walked over to clean it or notice it. It's not rocket science. Isn't that the job of the hostess to notice these things?

Let's talk about the food: major downgrade here. Plus somehow I don't remember this place being so pricey. Price wise it's close to what you would pay at Hopdoddy yet the quality isn't there (Hopdoddy is amazing). My ahi salad could have been airport food. The loaded French fries were gross and really for $7 you are going to give me the equivalent of a small sized fry? The fried zucchini sticks were tolerable but again, the quality of food for the $ doesn't match up. The food feels cheaply presented and cheaply prepared. 

Service wasn't awful but on a whole not a ton of redeeming qualities for me to ever go back."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this establishment...always a pleasant experience. This day, unlike the other two visits where I ordered a salad,  I ordered the Samburger (medium well) with blue cheese.  Oh my goodness!!!  That burger was soooo good it made my toes curl. Generally, I'm not a beef eater, but every once in a while I crave a burger. Today was that day. I could not have chosen a better spot. I went around 4ish, it wasn't busy, so I got a lot of attention from the bar staff. :-) 

I like the indoor/outdoor bar. There is outside seating as well.

All of the staff was great. The facility was clean; and very trendy. 

Four stars because I asked for no 1000 Island on my burger, but mustard and ketchup instead. The burger came with blue cheese, the bacon, burger, and the bun. I didn't complain, simply asked for ketchup and mustard and I added it to the burger. I will be back! :-)"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere. It's a winning concept with a good menu and good price points. I had the veggie burger, and it was very fresh and made with quality ingredients. The service could have been tweaked a bit. The timing was simply a tad off. Too many visits to the table when we weren't ready, and not enough when we were."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always perfect, service is great and drinks rock! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the place. The menu seems to add unnecessary items to the hamburgers, but it creates its own version. The Hamburger was made to order and everything was done right. I liked that high-class, but at the same time relaxed and friendly staff. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"First and last time here.... We ordered 2 burgers and 1 fry. Half way through one of the burgers we found a 4 inch black hair. Gross! When we mentioned it to the server he only said \"oh, I'm sorry.\" His attitude was the same as if he had forgotten to fill our drinks. The fries were horribly burnt. When we mentioned the burnt fries and even showed that in some places they look like they had actually caught fire, we got the same response...\"oh, I'm sorry\". Well, I'm sorry - I forgot to leave a tip! And we won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I got the turkey burger and added a fried egg. It was superb. Also, the sweet potato fries are a must and if you don't fill up on those make sure to try a milkshake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Let me start with saying that it was probably the best burger ice ever had! It was absolutely prefect, cooked right, not dry, the add on's were tasty. I ended up building my own with white cheddar, mushrooms, and bacon so it turned out just the way I like it.  :) my husband and son liked their burgers as well.  We also ordered shakes, strawberry and banana, that were delicious as well. 

Now why four stars? The price. For three burgers with fries, 3 shakes and a kid's meal it was $82 before tips! I'm sorry, I feel like it's really overpriced. If the bill had come out to be around  $55-60 I would 've given it six stars, their burgers are really good."}
{"text":"Had a really nice meal with friends outside. Excellent service. Good beer and wine selections. The five of us each had a different food offering and a different side. Truffle fries were excellent. Burgers all outstanding (including the turkey burger). I wish I could say only positive things, but I can't. The onion rings that I had on top of my burger were good. But the side order of onion rings was clearly out of a bag of frozens. I think I had those same onion rings at Jack-in-the-Box. Bottom line: a very reasonably priced meal with good beverages and efficient/friendly service. Just don't order the side of onion rings"}
{"text":"The food is above average and I have been there when they were not busy so it was not a problem. However, the business is run by very, very young people who have no idea how to serve people when they are busy. There were many, many tables vacant but the lady at the front counter said that we had to wait 40 minutes to get a table. Absolutely ridiculous. There were many tables outside in the courtyard that were vacant but the people outside had no idea what was going on. Terrible management and I will never go back there when it is busy."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying out this place while visiting family in Phoenix.  We arrived last night with a large party (9) and my sister was asked if she was open to putting us in two booths to which she replied no.  They then told us the wait would be 25-35 min for an inside table.  I arrived a few min behind and was again asked if I was open to 2 booths; not knowing my sister had told them no; I explained that I was visiting my family and we'd prefer to all sit together.  About 10 min later, the hostess approached us and told us that the wait was actually 45 minutes or we could sit outside and wait 35 minutes.  I have small children with me and it was too cool to sit outside.  Needless to say, we did not stay and went to a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Fabulous truffle fries and zucchini fries. I had the zin burger and it was wonderful juicy fresh num!! We also had a salted caramel shake and it was amazing very creamy and tasty - we sat outdoors and the weather was perfect. Great friendly service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for some shakes after a meal somewhere else. Not my first time so I know how great burgers are here. 
I got the latte shake and strawberry. Very tasty, we sat at the bar and had friendly service while enjoying those amazing shakes. When the time comes for a burger, I will be back."}
{"text":"Good hamburgers but not really better that Smashburger.  Trendy with a full bar and an emphasis on wine pairings.  Good but overpriced because of the trendy locations and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Zin, where Medium means Bloody Rare and soggy fries.   Service was fast and fair but what it really comes down to is the food and Zin isn't pulling it off.  $36 for one burger and two fries .... Nah, no thanks.   Slightly heart broken that the fries had no crunch.  I mean zero. Sigh.
Points for outdoor seating and that's a seasonal pleasure cruise.  I won't try it again."}
{"text":"Good hamburger. Not as good as the one in Tucson. Those burgers were to die for. Left with 2 shakes to take to the movies. Great service."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the gilbert location, which we've been wanting to try for some time. I made 430 reservations using the open table app to take advantage of their happy hour, easy peezy, got there and it wasn't too busy. 

We got seated right away by the nice hostess girl AND THEN WE SAT THERE FOR 15 MINIUTES, before one of the managers (I think she was a manager, she didn't introduce herself) and took our drink orders.  And then we sat there for about 10 more minutes; we were 15 feet from the bar and about 5 seconds from walking out with our two young boys to go across the street to Oregano's when our waitress finally showed up to take our drink orders again.  She apologized for the wait and promptly took our food orders. 

The jalapeno popper burger I got was underwhelming, the patty was very small, I'm talking McDonald's 99 cent burger small and it was dry, the waitress didn't ask our preference on how to cook it, so I guess it's my fault it was dead. The bun was cold and burnt, i did not eat it. 

My son loved his chicken tenders (that's not a big surprise) they were large and crispy. My wife's grilled chicken patty burger was ok, but Wendy's makes a better one and it's cheaper. 

The zucchini fries were a family favorite, BUT the onion straws were overcooked and more or less a more expensive version of French's fried onions, which would have been better. 

My oldest got the kid's meal cheeseburger with fries; and he ate it all with a bunch of ketchup. 

Both kids were more excited about their cherry-vanilla cokes.

 I probably won't be back, but it could have been an off night, so we'll see."}
{"text":"For the birds! 
Zinburger is one of those hip trendy places that is part of the so-called Burger Revolution, and sits right in the middle of the area of Phoenix that is known as Hamburger Row. What does this mean? Basically that it's a restaurant that can charge you $12 for a hamburger. Have the culinary arts \"progressed\" to the point that we know think of a burger as a gastronomical adventure and worth more than $6-7??? that is NUTS. Its a burger, get over yourselves pseudo-foodies. 
Well I gave it a try, because our party wanted to go there. Since you don't get a side with your entree, I found it odd that they served it on a large plate that was meant for more than 1 item. The burger looked pretty lonely on that big plate with nothing else on it. 
Right off the bat, they got my order wrong - I asked for medium-well and it arrived totally rare. That is a big turnoff for me - either someone doesn't listen or the cook is just incompetent. I told the server and he just took the plate away; someone else, I assume a manager came out with another burger, cooked to order, in like 1 minute. That was odd, they must have given me someone else's. He was apologetic, but only enough to perform his duties without actually showing that it matters if they can cook their burgers properly or not. This tells me it happens often, and they are used to it. 
Now the burger itself - the applewood smoke bacon tasted only of cured salt. In fact, it gave the entire burger nothing but this massive salt taste. It was like a sodium megabomb with none of that real bacon flavour, just the curing. The rest of the burger was a big soggy mess... the bun was way too small and pretty much disintegrated before I got halfway through. In the end I was basically just eating bits of the patties covered in the condiments, and not actually holding a burger in my hand. It all just felt and tasted wrong. As a lover of classic American hamburgers, to me this place is for birds. Waste your money on something you can barely eat half of, because you are in a hip scene. BS. Your wealthy grandmother may like it, but it's not a place for full-blooded American men who want a satisfying hamburger, even one that is more fancy than your average burger joint. Personally, if I am going that route, I will stick to Delux Burger, because there you can actually taste the quality you are overpaying for! That is a delicious hamburger that does not disappoint, unlike Zinburger which I cannot recommend to another man and look him in the eye with no shame."}
{"text":"Come here every time I go to Phoenix. Great burgers after a few hours of shopping. Zin burger is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox doesn't do much wrong. As always, modern architecture, friendly staff, great drinks, and live vibes. I come here about once a week and get the zinburger and sweet potato fries. One of my favorite combos at any restaurant. Only complaint is the occasionally slow service, but that is probably in part to the fact I drink water like a camel. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Long wait for a burger that was not worth it, plus fries are extra...the noise level was ridiculous, will not be returning"}
{"text":"Love the food to bits BUT the service stinks. They ALWAYS get it wrong and ALWAYS make you wait extra for tables even though they have them clean and available. What's the deal with that? Anyway, as the food is good we will continue to come"}
{"text":"Our first time in Phoenix. We stayed at the Camby, which is across from Biltmore Village. Zinburger is one of many restaurants in this area. We were in the mood for a burger. We both had burgers with zucchini fries. The food was great. The service was very good. Really liked the atmosphere for a casual dining establishment.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing service from the greeting at the door to the friendly and efficient wait staff. Burgers and Double Truffle Fry were fantastic. I got the Asian Chicken Salad. It was fresh, light and full of flavor with crisp vegetables and plenty of grilled chicken. It's a touch pricy but the servings are large and shareable if desired. 
We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had the Kobe burger and it was delicious!! Soft bun with well seasoned and tender beef.
The sweet potato fries were tasty too."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in Zinburger to grab quick bite to eat during Happy Hour! I was pleasantly surprised by the options of burgers that were available on Happy Hour and sides. The patio is very good option during this time of the year with heater close by to help keep you warm. 

I tried the sloppy joe sandwich which was delicious with tangy BBQ sauce w/ side of pickles. 

My mom had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which had surprise spicy sauce. 

Sides: sweet potato fries and onion nest. 

Everything we tried was delicious and very satisfying! Tip - Go prior to dinner crowd or use Yelp app to reserve table during dinner rush /see wait time."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  First time my burger was overdone.  There again this week and my medium well was bloody!  Not happy!"}
{"text":"Zinburger is a well known establish in Phoenix with this location being one of their more recent location. If you're looking to come here for dinner, look into making reservations through the Yelp app.

The space is quite large, with multiple screens at the bar area. There is a decently sized outdoor seating area. It isn't necessarily ideal for very large groups. I would say that the best size would be a party of 4.

Food at Zinburger is typical of American burgers, elevated a notch with unique flavor combinations and sauces. There are some special burgers that rotate every few months, so if a special sounds delicious, be sure to order it because the next time you eat here, it may be gone. There is a happy hour, so look online to see what the hours are so you get some deals on the appetizers.

If this is your first time, the \"zinburger\" is a good place to start. It's a classic burger. The Samburger is delicious, too. For those who don't like to eat red meat, there are some other options, such as the turkey burger and the black bean burger. The portion size for the fries is quite large, so I would recommend splitting it between at least two people. My favorite are the sweet potato fries because they come with this very light, cucumber dipping sauce. It is very delicious and refreshing. Another delicious feature on their menu is their milkshakes. My personal favorite is the hazelnut milkshake. If you're a fan of nutella or Kindle chocolates, this is for you! 

Parking can be limited in this area and with a very busy wait time for dinner, try to plan accordingly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decided to have my birthday dinner at the Zinburger because of their options of Gluten free buns.. After ordering and letting the waiter know of my allergy I find out half way eating that the bun was a gluten bun. (My friend tasted mine to compare.) And my horrible reaction hours later went to confirm. The server had only a few tables since it was about closing- but kept messing everything up. He would ask the same questions repeatedly and then brought back someone else's checks with their credit cards. 
I suspect the waiter was either under the influence or slightly incompetent. The food is good- but the service was unacceptable."}
{"text":"We visited ZinBurger a few weeks ago. It was pretty busy so it's a sign of good things to come. We sat on the patio. Nice weather so it was very comfortable. We had a great server. Brought out the beers fast. It took us a minute to look over the menu . We ordered but hate it when resturaunts have a 10-12$ burger and the fries are separate. But any how I ordered a guacamole burger with a side of loaded fries ...It was decent . Although I've had Many burgers from Many places. The food was good. But it was a $65 for Me , my wife and two kids. Plus tip . So a $77 meal. OUCH!!! Maybe we will come back."}
{"text":"I'll admit I haven't always been the biggest fan of some of the Fox Concepts restaurants, but Zinburger took me by surprise. First of all, I love what the downtown Gilbert area is doing with the addition of the Heritage Marketplace. ZInburger is one of the many new restaurant additions. The restaurant itself is beautiful with its open patio seating and the downtown Gilbert agriculture feel to the decor. They have tons of artwork depicting cows because of their freshly ground Certified Angus beef they use to make their burgers. I had the Ringer burger and it was pretty good as was the sweet potato fries. My only knock is that the burgers don't include a side and have to be purchased separately. Great job Sam Fox, you get a positive review on this one."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed in this place. Service was okay, but definitely not on Fox Restaurant level. My burger first came out wrong and then when it finally came out correct it was definitely overcooked. Definitely wasn't worth what I paid for it. The kid's meal is a great deal ($4 for a meal, side and drink), but its really irritating (and sexist) that the men's bathroom doesn't have a changing table (the women's does). This is 2018, men can change diapers."}
{"text":"This review is based on the more expensive Kobe burger that is simply the best burger in Phoenix so far.  The parking is easy, secured and with parking validation, and in close proximity with some great shopping.  Although the atmosphere is not as good as The Grind, Indulge and Deluxe, respectively, the service is the nicest, on par with Indulge."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite burger joints in town.  Prices during happy hour are incredible, especially for such a nice part of town.  The zinburger, which is my absolute favorite burger is only $5!! They definitely have my favorite zucchini fries in town because they're always perfectly cooked AND perfectly coated in Parmesan cheese.  Dipped in ranch dressing, they are little fried pieces of heaven.  The beer and wine specials during happy hour are also very generous.  Service was top notch and he was very sweet to my very energetic 4 year old.  Even without happy hour pricing I would definitely go back. If only it was closer to me!"}
{"text":"We have come here plenty of times and it has always been delicious. But, recently we came here (10-6-16) and my burger was completely Raw in the middle (like still cow mooing) and I ordered it to be cooked medium. My burger was remade and I asked for it to be medium well done and the burger was cooked this time but a little greasy. Wish they would have comped my meal but they didn't. Everyone was pretty much done eating their meals when my new burger came out."}
{"text":"Tried Zinburger for the first time last weekend.  Walked in and were seated immediately (table for 2) at 5pm on a Friday evening.  The Hostess arrangement is a little awkward and wasn't easily identified depending on which entrance you come in.
Our server was very pleasant and eager to let us know the daily specials.  Drinks arrived fairly quickly, though they could use larger glasses for iced tea...too many refills for my liking, even though they were refilled fairly quickly.
We ordered the loaded fries as an appetizer.  For the price, I would have expected more fries than 2 people could eat.  This wasn't the case.  Portion size was too small for the $8 - $9 price tag.
We both ordered the original Zinburger...what a treat!  The only word to describe it...DELICIOUS!  We were not surprised by the burger cost as we've paid more for a burger no where near as good.

The place was busy the entire time we were there, which may account for the lengthy delay in getting our check.  

Can't say enough about the quality of the food, the open-family atmosphere and service staff.  Price could be improved or portion sizes could be more in line with price.

We will return for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to my share of burger joints and while they don't have the best burgers that I've ever had, they are still pretty darn good. If you don't mind the price, they can give a good quality burger of almost kind you want. Fries and shakes aren't bad either. I don't recall a time that I had a bad experience with the staff."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed the food.  Burger was done the way I wanted and was tasty and the ranch for the fries is amazing!  My honey's burger came with avocado instead of cheese... not even close.

I do think the fries should come WITH a burger for the price.  Also, the atmosphere is good but would be MUCH better if I wasn't being stared at by a giant cow on the wall while eating a burger... CREEPY!"}
{"text":"I've had two recent opportunities to try out this place.  It seems there has been a trend in the Valley: there are a lot of newish burger places.  Some of them are chains (Five Guys, Smashburger), and some are gourmet burger joints (Delux, Zinburger, etc.).  I, personally, always welcome a new burger joint.

My first visit, I was flying solo on a Friday night, and sat at the bar.  This isn't the type of place at which you would typically want to be seen dining alone on a Friday night, but I will always maintain that it is my friends who are lame, not me.  Thankfully, the girl working the bar was nice and friendly.  Zinburger definitely gets points for friendly service.

I also appreciated that they let me drink a bottle of the Thomas Kemper Orange Cream Soda that they presumably use for the 50/50 floats.  Having a bottled or on-tap soda with my burger always makes the meal more complete.

As far as the actual burgers are concerned, I'd say they're pretty good, but not the best I've ever had.  The toppings are where they shine - there are about a dozen different cheese options, as well as bacon, avocado, peppers, wild mushrooms, a fried egg, and a variety of sauces that aren't listed on the menu.  Get a good combination, and a medium rare burger there really is quite respectable.

The double truffle fries are also excellent, and the zucchini fries aren't bad (though I couldn't even eat half the order).  And right now, they have a blackberry peach lemonade that is spectacular.

Finally, a word on the shakes: they're good, but not $6 good.

Truthfully, this place is borderline five stars, but the only reasons it's not, in my mind, is because I've had Diablo Burger in Flagstaff, and you can plan on spending at least $20 for a burger, side, and a drink."}
{"text":"Always a homerun! Brought my adult kids and we were blessed the last few times to have Kasey as our server. She's first class all the way spreading love and light. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch. Two of had the Noy Blu burgers - cooked to order with grilled onions and blue cheese. Yum!  Margaret was happy with her standard Zin burger while Sharon had her favorite salad. The milk shakes are worthy of consideration - if you are not counting calories.   Nice location in the Quarter. Get lucky and get a patio table"}
{"text":"First time at zinburger yesterday and I couldn't be more impressed! I had the el Diablo and sweet potato fries. The burger had a perfect kick to it. Service was awesome and I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Trendy and SO expensive. 

I guess the new burger craze is to make fancy, expensive burgers. Don't get me wrong, the burger was delicious, but I just can't believe the price. We got an order of loaded fries, onion rings and two burgers and our bill was $52! Every item is sold separately, so they're able to gauge you. 

I had the Ringer Burger, which was good, but needed more Franks red hot sauce. Bf got the Sam burger. Again, delicious, but not worth the price. And I don't know why, but it really bugs me that the burgers don't come with sides. 

Service was good. Drinks were refilled quickly. They left the doors open though, so we had to keep shoo-ing flies away from our food, which was annoying."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite hamburger restaurants.  The service is awesome, the dining room is comfortable and the food is delicious!

It was hard to decide what to order, everything on the menu seems enticing.  They also have weekly specials to change up the menu a little bit. 

The burgers we ordered were very good.  You have to order fries separately if you want them but they're worth it.  My husband also ordered a milkshake that was absolutely perfect ( he had to share )"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because of all the great reviews I read about their burgers. When we got there, we were greeted by a not-so-friendly hostess and we had to wait 10 minutes. However, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I got the son burger and my boyfriend got the samburger. Both were very good in terms of flavor! Everything is purchased a la carte so we also got a side of fries. Neither one of us could finish our own burger. The buns are huge and very filling. Nonetheless, the burger itself is great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Zinburger is the place to go if you want a really tasty burger - and an amazing shake.  They have wine and beer and stuff, too, but...the milk shakes!!!

I got the My Boy Blue this time - a juicy burger (medium rare!), Maytag Blue Cheese, A1 Sauce, Caramelized Onion, Lettuce & Mayo.  Had some sweet potato fries for the table.  Split a Banana Royale shake with my son.

Everything tasted great.  The service was also terrific.

Good food, good fun...and...amazing milk shakes!!!"}
{"text":"Zinburger is my favorite premium burger joint.

All the burgers I've tried have been really tasty - my favorite is the Samburger, with the Breakfast Burger a close second.

The Sweet potato fries are really great, too, as are the pickles that come with the burgers.

Top that all off with one of their signature shakes, and you are in for a great burger experience.  Hats off to Fox Restaurant Concepts for knocking another one out of the park!"}
{"text":"I was dining alone and told I could only sit at the bar or outside.
I could clearly see 2 open tables.
And, on a thursday!"}
{"text":"I've lost that loving feeling...sorry Zinburger won't be seeing you anytime soon again.

Ordered a kale Caesar with chicken and there was barely any chicken! It was shaved chicken that was not worth adding to the salad for more $

My dining companion said the burger was cold.

Much better food at Delux. Bummer."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by how similar this place is to Hopdoddy's from the decor to the menu layout. I ordered the Christmas special, which would have been better named the Thanksgiving special. Honestly, there was nothing really special about it. I did, however, really love the Nutella shake. That's the one thing that I can confidently recommend."}
{"text":"Good burgers make sure you get the apple wood smoked bacon burger and a shake well worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and speciality milkshakes and cocktails. The grass fed burgers are like butter in your mouths. Great atmosphere and outdoor seating. I will be coming back for sure!!! $$-$$$"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Service was a bit slow. Waited almost 5 minutes for ketchup and mustard  after our burgers arrived. My burger was barley warm by the time I got to bite into it. May try again"}
{"text":"We love Zinburger!!! This place never disappoints. I always get the spicy chicken burger! It's my absolute favorite. They allow dogs on the patio which makes it really convenient for our family since we have a new puppy we have to bring with us. The service is always exceptional and the locations are always beautiful. My only complaint is that they don't have one in Las Vegas! But both the Biltmore & Scottsdale locations are amazing!"}
{"text":"After a quick business meeting in Phoenix today, I stopped by to try their Kobe beef burger that I have heard is one of the best.

It is located in a the beautiful Biltmore Fashion Center where my beloved Captial Grille is as well.

I arrived at 11:00 at got a great booth table.  The restaurant has a trendy-up-scale decor that has outdoor and indoor seating.

Once I sat down, I immediately ordered the Kobe Beef Burger with chedder cheese, mushrooms and a fried egg.  On the side, I ordered their truffled fries and a slice of their banana cream pie for desert.

The burger contained 8 ounces of Kobe Beef which was juicy, flavorful and fatty-delicious.  The mushrooms, cheese and egg went terrific with the burger.  The bun was warm and very soft.....to a  point where the bun fell apart after one bite:(

The Kobe Beef Burger was not the best I have had...that title goes to the Old Homestead in NY.   But for 14.00...it was pretty good.

The truffled fries were cooked perfectly..just the right amount of truffle oil.

The banana cream pie was the bomb.....full of flavorful banana cream and whipped cream.

The service was outstanding......the HOT waitresses in their tight shorts + the cute mgr came by my table several times:)

A great burger meal............!!"}
{"text":"Zinburger is one of my favorite spots! Their happy hour is awesome (get the onion nest) and the loaded fries are to die for! Great service and awesome food."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  I have only eaten there once now but had a very tasty burger, sweet potato fries and a green tea. All of which were very good, served by friendly staff and it didn't take too long to get our food either.  If you are into teas, try their iced green tea, it was the best I've EVER had!  The burgers were pretty big, come hungry!"}
{"text":"First...great burger! Second...subpar service. We got our fries way before our burgers. Burgers came and it was the weirdest mash-up of the burgers we ordered, which were straight off the menu. They took the burgers back to the kitchen and \"fixed\" them. As a \"gift\" they were going to give us more fries that came about 10 minutes after we finished our burgers. I'd give it another try, hoping it was an off night because the food really was great."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was amazing. The wait wasn't long for a table and everyone was very friendly. Thanks to our waiter Gary, for really tending to our party of seven. The hamburgers were excellent and cooked exactly the way I asked it to be. The truffle fries is a must."}
{"text":"LOVE it so much that we ate here two nights in a row during our Phoenix trip! Might be the best meal I've ever had! The special of the week American Kobe burger w/Oregon morrell mushrooms is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great staff and the shakes...Well goodbye diet."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the Valley.  

And they have a great outdoor covered patios, so you can see the parade of people as they wander around the Scottsdale Quarter.

So if you want a great burger and nice scenery, this the place to go."}
{"text":"Quick service, great food, and Jamie always makes sure to take care of us! She truly makes the drive worth it. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers, truffle fries and HUGE shakes!

The wait on a Saturday afternoon was about 20+ minutes, but we found seats at the bar right away.  The restaurant is fairly small, but there is a large patio.  The burgers were cooked perfectly, the truffle fries and sauce were to die for and the Strawberry Cheesecake shake was gigantic and yummy!  

We spent $40 on two burgers, one set of fries and one shake, so this place isn't cheap, but it sure is delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice place for adults and kids, nice servers, good food and drinks, What else do you need? I prefer happy hour"}
{"text":"I came in to this restaurant with one other person between 4-5 PM on a weekday. Luckily, there was no wait. To start, we split a nutella hazelnut crunch shake (the waitress was kind enough to put the shake in two separate cups)! It was almost too rich, but the crunch factor was pleasant. During the time we went, it happened to be happy hour. This meant that there were half priced appetizers, drink specials, and the simple & plain burger for half off. We decided to try the double truffle fries. Delicious!! The order had enough for two people to share. I had the blanco burger with Kobe style beef. It was tender, juicy, and tasted as if Mexican style nachos had a child with a traditional burger. Tons of flavor. The person I was with had the Ringer burger. Unfortunately, all we could really taste was the Frank's red hot sauce...which pretty much killed the flavor of everything else on the burger. So unless you REALLY love the flavor of that hot sauce, I wouldn't recommend it. To end the meal, we shared a slice of banana cream pie. The slice was enormous! Glad we shared it. It was very creamy and sweet; the crust on the pie was to die for! The staff were all very attentive and considerate while serving our table. The parking situation was pretty decent considering the restaurant is located in downtown Gilbert. I would recommend parking in the parking structure that is west of the restaurant. Not a far walk, and the parking spots are roomy."}
{"text":"Ok, I know most of you would look for a big beef loaded burger at Zinburger. BUT, if you are looking for something other than beef, I would like to suggest trying the chicken burger. Since being advised by my Cardiologist about keeping my cholesterol levels in check I have been looking at more chicken experiences than beef or turkey (yes, turkey has nearly as much cholesterol as beef).

One day I decided to try the \"West Coast Chicken Burger\" and change it up a bit. I like things kind of spicy, so I asked for Chipotle mayo and Jalapenos added. 

I have to tell you this was an amazing chicken burger. The chicken was juicy and the seasoning with the extras to kick it up made this a fantastic meal.

If you have a hanker'n for something just a little different, I would strongly suggest you try it.

~Stew"}
{"text":"I was blown away by the Ahi burger.  

As a Pescabacatarian (fish, veggies, bacon) I didn't think I would find anything here to eat.  When i saw the Ahi on the menu I decided to give it a try.  It was perfectly cooked, the bun was great and it wasn't heavy or too filling.

I've heard good things about the fries and shakes so I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The only issue I have with Zinburger is that it takes us about 50 minutes to get there. Best veggie burger I've ever had anywhere and the zucchini is to die for. Love, love, love the fries. My husband's favorite is the Kobe burger and the kids love the havarti chicken burger. And omg, don't leave without trying the salted caramel shake! 

Yes, it might seem a bit pricey but it's really not much more than we spend at Red Robin and it's a whole lot better. Just typing this review is making me want to go to Zin for lunch, and we just ate there yesterday!"}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed this place. Burgers were spot on and cooked perfectly and truffle fries were crispy and awesome. Loved the beer selection as well as their specialty drinks so why only 3 stars? Prices were pretty high for burgers and beer."}
{"text":"Love this place.  This is our go-to whenever people are in town, and we want to go somewhere close that isn't very expensive and is good every time.  We must have taken at least a handful of different people here in the last year, and every single time our guests have said it was great.

My personal favorites are the Bruce Lee (unique & spicy...never had anything like it), the My Boy Blue, the Breakfast Burger, and the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.  Last time I was there, I forced myself to try a turkey burger just because I've been there so many times and never have before (the beef burgers are so good it was hard to deviate).  I'm really glad I did.  It was delicious and I will definitely be ordering turkey burgers more often going forward (you can get any of their burgers as a turkey burger).

Also, all of their specialty fries are superb.  I've had them all, but my favorite are the green chili fries, which definitely have a kick.  My second favorite are the truffle fries.  My wife loves the zucchini fries, and I think there are two other kinds (sweet potato and bacon ranch) and they are both really good too.  All of these go great with their salted caramel malt.

If you go during happy hour, the fries and draft beers are half price.  In short, getting half priced green chili fries and a half priced Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA to start, followed by a Bruce Lee burger, is a great little evening."}
{"text":"The only reason this place didn't get all five stars because when we got there it took a while for us to have someone come to our table. The food was amazing and they were even helpful with my gluten allergy."}
{"text":"Favorite burger joint. I always get the zinburger, my husband gets the el Diablo, and we split the zucchini fries. It's all so delicious! The burgers tastes fresh and juicy and the ingredients they choose in each burger are very complimentary flavors. Zucchini fries are the best we've ever had. Crunchy outside and soft inside but definitely not over cooked. This is our go to date night. The only con would be the line. On Friday, Saturday, Sundays you're looking at an hour and a half wait but that just goes to show how great it really is!"}
{"text":"Having lunch at our usual spot, my experience was far from average thanks to our waitress, for making our experience exceptional. Instead of ordering my usual plain and simple burger, she persuaded me to try the El Diablo burger and I was very impressed! So delicious and I still can't stop thinking about how delicious it was. Also she was very attentive to our needs and always brought extra napkins and condiments without having to ask. I will be asking to sit in kaylee's section from now on."}
{"text":"Totally delish! High quality ingredients, fresh veggies, great service. What's not to love? Green chili fries are awesome although we suggest chipotle sauce on the side as its overwhelming. The chicken sandwich was amazing and the prickly pear margarita was good (but I would not crave it)."}
{"text":"Today I came in for lunch I ordered a veggie burger the food was amazing so that's why you even got some stars but the service was completely ridiculous. I was sitting around for 20 minutes to even get my food then when I was finished I waited another 10 minutes for my check. The check got double charged so instead of 22 it was 42 and she even put a different receipt of my original price on top. Thankfully I saw it. It was corrected right away and the bartender apologized but she totally forgot to give me my debit card. Then I had to go in after work to grab my card and literally just waited another 15 minutes for them to walk in the back and grab my fricken card for me. Never ever coming here again. Waisted so much of my time today on this place. Wasting more writing this review but I feel like I'm so pissed I need to say SOMETHING!  Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Another Fox restaurant that is extremely overrated.

The burgers are decent, nothing too excellent or unique about them.  I think they're pretty greasy because I was nauseous after half a burger.  I tried the Zinburger and Diablo.  

The truffle fries are ok but limp.  The aoli that comes with it isn't very well matched to it.  The sweet potato fries were ok but also a bit undercooked.

Not a fan, no need to go back."}
{"text":"Came here last night for date night with the girlfriend and like always, this place does not disappoint!

It was her first time going and I know that it won't be our last!

The drinks are amazing, the shakes are superb, and the burgers are to die for! The Bruce lee burger, in my opinion, the tastiest burger that they have!

We went during happy hour and the food came out super fast! Our server, Justin, I believe was super nice and friendly. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great drinks. Best burger I have ever had."}
{"text":"We used to drive to downtown Phoenix to go to the Zinburger located there because we love it so much. This Gilbert location is much closer for us, although either way  you'll most likely have a wait. It's worth it though. I looooove fries and could almost just have fries for my meal here. The burgers don't come with fries so I normally order for the table. We get the truffle oil, zucchini and sweet potato... all so, so good. You really can't go wrong here. If you like beef, get the grass fed. The drinks and shakes are bomb too. I would eat here any time. Fun, casual and quality food."}
{"text":"I had the \"Samburger\" bacon, American cheese, 1000 island sauce.  The bread was a brioche Bun.
Wonderful tasting burger!!  Nice and light burger.  It didn't load me down (felt heavy), as other burger places have done.  I was full without being stuffed.  
I will defiantly recommend this place to other."}
{"text":"I think that I will have to go back and try Zinburger again and not try the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. My bad. I am at a burger joint and should try the burger. The sweet potato fries were good, but did not enjoy the sauce. 

I think that just because other places are making yummy burgers, does not mean that another \"me too\" can deliver that same special something that they have. I am just saying..."}
{"text":"I love the food but last ime i was in my waiter, Tyler was absolutely rude and  not only the least helpful person ever he acted as if he was better than my family. To be honest he was very rude and actually seemed to be that way to his co-workers too. Such a good product hard to see why they ruin the fox name with employees that treat customers in this fashion."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is meh. I  came with my older godparents and 2 year old son. They have a great deal in the summer for kids meals at $3 which sounded good but the waitress forgot that drinks were included until I read the fine print and asked her for a drink after we received his cheeseburger. No apology just an \"ok\". Ok, no biggie. My son didn't like his cheeseburger because he's picky so I stopped the waitress to order something else (grilled cheese) which he also didn't like but that's another story. She said ok but didn't offer to take it off the bill since my son didn't like it... ok no biggie either I guess. I don't mind paying for 2 kids meals it's just usually courtesy to offer to take it off the bill if a customer doesn't like it (even if he is 2). The fries that came with the burger were cold, soft and under salted but 10 minutes later the fries with the grilled cheese were crispy and excellent. Weird. All of our burgers were really good, I will definitely give them that! I ordered the Zinburger which was great and we split the sweet potato fries which were also good. I do not believe a lunch like this is worth a little over $55 after tip but that's just me. The service wasn't bad... just could definitely be better!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times because I'm a downtown Gilbert resident and I definitely like the vibe at Zinburger other than my most recent visit this last Saturday night. The food is usually very good and the service is okay unfortunately last Saturday the bartenders were atrocious.  No one came to greet us once we sat at the bar, I had to ask the girls that were sitting next to us if I could use their menu to read off of so that we may order, and there was just a general lack of concern as to whether or not we were enjoying our time there. I won't be back, Barrio Queen has won my patronage."}
{"text":"I had the zinburger which was a  7 ounce hamburger patty with manchego cheese, zinfandel braised onions, lettuce and mayonnaise.  

The burger was cooked correctly but it seemed to need another ingredient to complement the other flavors.  These ingredients seem to cancel each other out.  It maybe need another flavor such as bacon bits or bell peppers.  Something to push the flavor wheel in a specific one direction.  The zinbuger had zin but no zing.  Lol."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and the beverages were okay but their signature dish - a burger - was pretty disappointing. I ordered the Samburger fka/aka a California Burger. The bun was okay and the fries were at least warm but the burger patty lacked texture ( ordered it cooked to medium ) and was much like what I imagine meat paste to be.    Not going to make a return visit."}
{"text":"Crumbly buns and soggy zucchini fries.....enough said. 

I don't know how they justify charging so much when the food is mediocre at best.

The only redeeming feature was being seated immediately on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Well it's another weekend and another Sam Fox Concept restaurant to try.  Life is so boring here in the Valley.  LOL

There have been quite a few \"premium priced\" burger places popping up lately.  So, in many ways Zinburger's only competition in this category has been Hopdoddy. Both are upscale $10 plus burger places, that have interesting choices of tastes, add-ons, buns, etcetera. 

The food at Zinburger is very good. It's served fast and you won't feel like your wallet took a major hit. Our bill came to $33.00 before taxes and gratuities, which is expensive when only compared to the \"In 'n Out\" and \"Habit Burger\" of the world. But for us, it's the Zinburger's taste which we feel is unique and worthy of their premium price that makes us want to come back and we will. 

We tried their Kobe Burger ($15.00), Sam Burger ($11.00) and Zucchini fries ($7.00) and blown away the experience. The Sam had applewood smoked bacon, cheese and 1000 island dressing, which all worked well together. But the star was the Kobe, which is served simply with cheddar cheese, mushrooms and mayonnaise.  You have to try it, it's delicious. Really!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Unexciting menu. All apps are fries of some sort. Burgers are average. Beer selection is below average compared to most places nowadays. Service and atmosphere was good but really no reason to put this restaurant on the rotation."}
{"text":"The only thing amazing was how sweet my bartender was. The beer i ordered had a 3 inch head and when i mentioned it, i guess it was company policy. The basket of onion rings were good and bit salty but way over-priced. Ill give you guys another try."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after work on a Monday in the very early evening. They have a happy hour menu that gives you half off a lot of their appetizers. It's pretty appetizing. I ordered the breakfast burger subbing out the american cheese for manchego and also got their truffle fries off the happy hour menu. 

The fries were really well done. The portion is good for sharing between two people which they also suggest on the menu. 

I ordered my burger medium. The patty is a medium size, egg was over easy, and their brioche bun was very light while strong enough to hold the burger together through the entire affair (I swear I'm not a messy eater). The burger was good but I felt the patty wasn't *incredibly* flavorful. I actually felt a little disappointed because the meat itself tasted decidedly average despite the great presentation. 

I pretty much finished all the food but I also didn't eat all day. I was decidedly full afterwards but that's mainly because I ate almost a whole basket of fries. I would say normally you'd probably be fully but not painfully so. Their portions definitely hit the sweet spot. 

They also have a fried chicken sandwich and, when I was there, a fried chicken special I elected not to try despite loving fried chicken. I'll have to go back next time to try it. 

I would definitely recommend trying out Zinburger if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Lots of choices on cheese and meats and sides.. Love the downtown atmosphere and sitting outside"}
{"text":"We were sooo happy when Sam Fox opened one of his Zinburgers here in Scottsdale Quarter.  Our taste buds leaped for joy.  

We've always enjoyed their Biltmore location. And even though the service here could be better and the location enlarged, the burgers were...  great. 

We returned last evening for our fourth visit. I would plan on a thirty minute wait, but that will allow you to hit some of the nearby stores. The time went by quickly, with a band playing in the promenade.  Nice!

We started off with their yummy fried zucchini sticks ($7.00), adding the Chipotle Mayo dip to the Ranch was a great idea. I decided to try their Kale Caesar ($4.50). It was good, but needed a little more dressing. 

As for our burgers, we ordered the Breakfast ($12.50) open face and their house Zin($10.50).  Mine had an fried egg on top, with applewood bacon,
avocado, cheese, lettuce and mayo; while the Zin had manchego cheese, yummy zinfandel Braised Onions with lettuce and mayo.  Both were delicious.

I believe the secret to Zinburger is how they make their burgers.  Rather compacting the chopped meat and squeezing out all the air pockets. They form them gently. That way the smoky taste permeates the meat.

Expect to pay $20 each plus taxes and gratuities, including soft drinks and one appetizer or small salad each.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"4 or 5 stars for the food, but a couple things rubbed me the wrong way about this place.  First there was the decor.  Although I love huge wall photo-murals, I found the gigantic cow-in-a-pasture scene off-putting.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I care about animals to the extent that when I'm eating meat I don't like to think about the actual slaughter part.  So seeing the sunny cow mural when I walked in just gave me a bad image of those poor shiny happy cows being murdered.  Yes, we're eating cows, but let's have some respect.  Luckily I had already planned on having the vegetable burger.  Decor-wise I also found the servers' brown uniforms pretty heinous.

Zinburger: Since when are fries an appetizer?  Who eats a complete meal and then orders a milkshake for dessert?  The waitress was nice enough to ask if we wanted our shakes for dessert or with the food (with the food - duh!), but she failed to ask if we wanted our fries with our burgers.  The Double Truffle fries were awesome but unfortunately there weren't many left by the time the burgers came out.  

I highly recommend Clint's Almost Famous Vegetable Burger, which is more of a black bean burger and comes with cheese and a fresh tomato topping.  It was huge and had a lot of flavor.  I appreciate that Zinburger has several salads and a veggie burger for those of us trying to eat on the \"lighter side\" (if you don't count the fries and root beer float I couldn't turn down).  The Bananas Foster Shake was out-of-this world, as you can imagine from the name.  And the root beer float...well, how can a root beer float ever be bad?"}
{"text":"Good spot for a burger or salad in the Biltmore. I want to say each experience prior to this one has been very good. The service and food are typically on point. However, our last visit was with a large group for my nephews birthday. We ordered the kids their meals first in hopes of avoiding any meltdowns. About 15-20 minutes later the adults began to order their meals. The adult meals came out first with the kids waiting another 45 minutes to eat. Half of the meals were entered incorrectly and/or were never placed by the server. The experience on this particular evening was a real struggle. It may be a while until I'm back. I like the food, but the service needs to improve."}
{"text":"I hit Zinburger for lunch a Tuesday, no wait for a table at 12:15, excellent start to the lunch.  However, we decided to sit at the bar.  Garrett was a great bartender for us.  Wines that went with our food and friendly service.  

First time at Zinburger and I didn't even order a burger, not wanting something too heavy, I ordered the chinese chicken salad and zucchini fries.  Both were fantastic. 

The atmosphere was nice, no one too loud, I didn't have to yell to talk to my friends, always a plus.

I will have to go back to order a burger."}
{"text":"Long wait for a table, but service is very quick once you are in. The loaded fries were amazing and the highlight of the meal. The beef itself was good, however they should toast the bun or something because my bun was a soggy mess and inedible after a few minutes.

It's also a little loud, our poor waitress was so hoarse from yelling all day I couldn't even understand her.

I have mixed feeling if I will return or not. I spent about $40 for two burgers, one fry and 2 sodas, so price is a little high."}
{"text":"The people in charge of opening this place have no clue what they're doing. We came in on Sunday evening. There were several, several tables open both inside and outside but we were quoted a 30 minute wait because the kitchen was backed up. At 45 minutes, still with several tables open, they still weren't sure when they could seat us. It didn't help the receptionists were approx. 15 years old, unprofessional, and clueless. I will be boycotting this place for a while."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the environment at this restaurant, but the music was a little loud to have a good table conversation.  There were 6 of us and we all enjoyed our food.  Burgers, fries, onion rings, etc....  The truffle oil fries were quite tasty.  The chocolate milkshake was really good!  Prices were maybe a little high.  You would think paying $10 for a burger, you would get a side, but the burgers are ala carte.  The sides are each ~$7, but they are appetizer size so they can be shared between a couple of people.  Be careful of the sloppy joe on the kids menu.  It is not quite like you would make at home.  A different type of flavor that my daughter didn't like, but she is a picky eater.  I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Overpriced burgers with no sides. Breakfast burger is 12.50 and its 5 bucks to add fries. We ordered the regular fries which were slightly over cooked and lacked flavor. The sweet potato fries yogurt dipping sauce was weird and didn't pair well with the fries. The Napa salad was yummy but nothing to knock my socks off. For the price, I thought the quality would be better."}
{"text":"Hamburgers were delicious!  Also had the green chile fries which we devoured.  Beers were good.  Wine was a little on the pricey side.  Nice atmosphere and very modern inside. Happy Hour is a must!"}
{"text":"Has a wonderfully, extensive menu.  Everything we've tried has been delicious.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This is the best most friendliest restaurant at Scottsdale Quarter! Every time I go in everyone is smiling and welcoming. I can tell that there is much attention to detail in the food as well. I enjoy every dish I have when trying something new. All together I always have great time when I'm there."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I went here the other day with my boyfriend and we both got the Diablo burger with pepper jack cheese, grilled jalapeños, grilled onions, chipotle mayo, and it was amazing! The burgers are messy though. We also shared a regular fry which was also tasty. Afterwards we tried their shakes, I got the salted caramel and my boyfriend got the Oreo cookie. Both were to delicious and rich! However, very thick and we wished we had spoons. I went another time and we tried the spicy chili fries-- HIGHLY RECOMMEND. probably my favorite on the menu. Literally craving them as I write this. I wish I could just pick some up and not have to sit down and order and wait for a check. If you go, these fries are a MUST. Also the second time my boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich which he said was not very good, he claims the chicken itself was not nearly as good as the burger patty he had had previously."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant Burger I've had in Phoenix.  The meat was the perfect of steak and chuck.  OMG it was fingerlicking good. The service was spectacular as well.  The french fries werecooked perfect, nice and hot and wonderfuly crunchy.  We also had the shakesand they were delicous.  You cant go wrong at Zinburger."}
{"text":"Excellent service, perfect variety menu and top notch quality. Even on a busy holiday, everyone was wonderful and attentive!!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers fun atmosphere and half price on bottles of wine on wed?
We're Californians relocating to Az soon and LOVE the Resturaunt scene in the east valley and Scottsdale. Zinburger is a go to when we're in town."}
{"text":"Food was good, turkey burger great, zucchini fries were too oily for me.  Staff were great.  I didn't like the fact the children were sitting at the bar.   bathroom was clean.  I'll come back."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a party of 4 at about 7:30 and it was pretty busy.  We waited about 15 mins for a table on the patio.  The inside was pretty noisy so I'm glad we got to sit outside.  The decor of the place is pretty weird/different but I guess that's what people want.

Our waitress was helpful and friendly and my diet coke refills came quickly.

Our party split the Roasted Chicken Salad without the chicken.  It was interesting and pretty good.  Not really enough to share with 4 people though.  I don't understand why this place doesn't have just regular side salads.

Both the Zinburger and the Kobe burger were top noch.  The patties were fresh, juicy and cooked perfectly.  They were decently sized as well.  Not really worth $10+, but I can deal with it because they were good.

The sweet potato fries were very good.  Not oily or mushy.  I did not enjoy the yogurt sauce stuff because it was just a weird combination.  I loved loved loved the double truffle fries though.  I could eat an entire basket of those things by myself.  I thought the zucchini fries were just 'eh.  I think they lacked flavor and should have been a bit more crunchy.

Anyway, I really liked this place.  The parking and waiting for a table  is a pain in the butt but I would like to come back soon."}
{"text":"So we have been trying to get to Zinburger for awhile now.  Who doesn't love a good burger right!  We visited the Gilbert establishment because it is close to our home and there is an awesome parking garage there to keep your vehicle out of the Hellizona sun.  We were seated right away and our waiter was very attentive and not overly hovering.  We did get there around 4pm and there were plenty of seat but the place filled up quickly after that.  My husband is a chocolate malt connoisseur and that is the main reason we went.  He ordered the double chocolate malt for 6.00.  Yikes!  A tad pricey but heck you only live once.  He got the double cheeseburger and the extra cost regular fries.  I got the El Diablo and the jalapeño fries.  I ordered both with the chipotle mayo on the side.  It was spicy and very smoky, a good spicy but a tad to smoky for my liking.  The burgers were very good, juicy and with lettuce and tomato.  Pickles on the side.  Mine had some carmellized onions on it.  All in all it was a delicious tasty messy 3 napkin kind of burger.  The fries were just ok.  They were a little too cold as if they make big batches at a time and they sit in a pan for too long and then they throw some cheese on top.  I've read other reviews about the fries and I have to agree although our fries and burgers came to us at the same time.  My husband's regular fries were the same, kinda cold and not crisp and hot.  Good burgers, not so good fries!  The double chocolate malt was so good my husband said that he ordered a second one!  Can you say oink oink!  All in all it was a good dinner.  We would go back.  Only thing I would improve on is the temp of the fries.  That is the reason for 4 stars and not 5.  I am going to try the pie on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Second visit here.  It's good,  but the issue is pricing.  Two domestic beers one burger and fries,  thirty bills before tip.  Not sure why fries can't come with the burger at the prices that are charged.  Some places in the area you can get a burger fries and a beer for the same price as the burger alone here.  I live nearby,  but will make a drive to spend half as much."}
{"text":"Starters: zucchini, sweet potato, and double truffle fries are all delectable.

Burgers: All excellent, especially My Boy Blue, and they're happy to customize your order

Desserts:  Milkshakes are an acceptable size, they try a little too much in my opinion because it seems too sweet.

Service: A little slow, but I think they were understaffed for that night, hopefully it's not every time."}
{"text":"Zinburger has really gone down hill. We used to love their burgers and amazing service. The last 2 times we have gone the service has been horrible. Rude servers with no attention to detail. They're more concerned with talking to other servers ... Laughing and joking around. Drink refills seem to be non-existent. Plus the food seems to be losing the quality it used to have.  The fries were soft and wiggly. The burgers not cooked to the requested temp. Too many chances and now we're done with this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, great location at the Biltmore, sort of pricey but not absurd, Had the \"Zinburger\", it's a fancy hamburger which isn't too bad but it wasn't anything notable, it was a tad on the bland side. Fries are not included and must be purchased separately, tried several varieties of the fries, again not bad but not memorable. Passion ice tea was pretty good. Looks like they have a good beer selection on tap. Parking is bit tight at this location, always nearly full controlled access parking that needs to be validated.
Four stars. Would try it again."}
{"text":"Party of six n a crowded Saturday.  Food was delicious.  Service was superb.  Well managed and excellent ingredients.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"We waited 15 after being seated. I had to find a manager to get us service as happy hour was about to run out. We ordered a cheeseburger as a Zin burger from happy hour menu. We were told that the burgers would be well done. Fine with us. Well. We were sitting outside. Hard to see very well. Cut burger in half. My daughter and I started eating. We realized that the burgers were raw. After sitting there for awhile as the others ate out server came by. We told him they were raw. He said sorry. He would let the manager know. She came by and asked if we wanted another burger. We declined as everyone else was done. We are half of each. And we were charged fur them!  Too funny!  Service was terrible. 1-16-2018"}
{"text":"See my tip about the best service ever! Wonderful and I mean WONDERFUL food. Decor so amazing...clean, well-decorated bathrooms. Atmosphere is brilliant. Again the service it TOP-NOTCH and I'm referring to Dani who helped out my kids and even brought sliced bananas for my 2 yr old. Then Greg (MGR) comped the shake since they accidentally brought the wrong one out the first time. Then hey decided to comp the fries too. All restaurant owners should dine here and take note. And let me just give a serious second shout out to Dani and Greg. Thanks for being great. Be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here tonight. Figured I better get my butt home and write this before I felt totally uninspired to do so. 

Love the concept but they just fail in the execution. The decor is just ridiculous. It's like a malt shop meets the farm. I just think that they could have done SO many more inventive things. It's a shame actually. 

We ordered two drinks and then looked over the menu for food. Our server was nice but she had another two top and a six top and I think she was a bit overwhelmed. She came back about 10 minutes later no drinks in hand but ready to take our order. 

We both ordered the Kobe with no cheese and mayo. An order of the truffle fries. 

About five minutes goes by and someone drops off our truffle fries but still no drinks. A few minutes later our food comes out and still no drinks. At this point I had to ask for them which is just ridiculous.  I ordered a $10 glass of wine and I seriously asked if the pour was right on it. It was tiny! 

The fries had come out cold but they were still decent. Not the best I've has but ok. The burgers were nothing special. They weren't bad but they weren't spectacular either. 

I think Fox missed the mark on this one. It's too bad! Save $40 and have a Five Guys burger!"}
{"text":"All I can say is the food is amazing! I had the chicken burger and zucchini fries with the banana cream pie for dessert. I thought I had died and gone to heaven eating the pie and I don't even like banana cream pie! Plus you get a quarter of a pie for your slice so it's big enough for two! Service was great too! Will definitely keep going back!"}
{"text":"Gluten free fryer.

A Celiac's favorite words.  You can have fries.  You can get a tasty burger with either a gluten free bun or lettuce wrap.  The waiters are knowledgeable and helpful.  It's pretty great."}
{"text":"The service was great and the open concept restaurant was amazing. We sat on the patio under he heaters and it was great. I thought the burgers were over priced and the ahi salad was small for $15. Drinks were priced well, my house red wine was great. Overall I wouldn't go back for the food, maybe for a drink on the patio. There's too many other great places with great food!"}
{"text":"The food here is always great. The zucchini fries and ahi burger are my personal fave. However, last week our server Kira (sp?) was fantastic! After mentioning a limited date shake flavor that was once available at the Tucson location, she went next door to True Food, found dates and had them make Ilya the very same date shake!! It was beyond good service!!"}
{"text":"We went on opening night and had a great experience.  It was as if the restaurant had been there for years - very well run.  The Zinburger with manchego cheese is amazing...yummy!  Everything Fox touches seems to turn to gold...yet another great concept."}
{"text":"We went on Wednesday night at 7:15pm and it was packed! We waited 30 min and were finally seated at a table we had seen empty for the past 20 minutes. Service was fast as soon as we sat down but the place was so noisy. It was hard to have a conversation without raised voices and it was just the two of us. 
We ordered the spicy green chili fries and they delicious!  They were muy picante so prepare yourself to need a tissue to blow your runny nose!  Our burgers were very good and perfectly cooked.  However, every so often I got a knuckle or gristle in my bite. Turned me off a bit.  We may go back but only if there's no wait. I prob will not order a burger again.  Prices are a bit too much for the quality and everything is a-la-cart. Burger $11.50, chili fries  $7.00, Dessert $7.00.  We drank water to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was aaaaamazing! Burgers are fresh & tasty. Nutella shake was flippn good!!"}
{"text":"Eh, expensive beer. The burger wasn't all that I had the green chili burger kinda disappointed. Will give it another shot. I really want to try that Kobe beef style burger. Hopefully that encourages me to edit this review and give it another star. I'm giving it 3 stars because the green chili fries where awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I did not enjoy our experience at Zinburger.  We wanted to sit outside.  They told us it would be a 15 minute wait to sit outside which I thought was odd because nearly half of the outside tables were open, and stayed open the entire time we were there.   We decided to sit inside.  The space is very cramped.  I felt like we were sitting on top of the people next to us.  The music was also insanely loud.  My husband and I practically had to scream at each other to hear each other.   Our waiter was nice enough but he seemed distracted.  The table next to us tried to grab his attention while he was taking our order, he stopped and turned to them and talked to them for at least 2 minutes before turning back to us.  I thought it was incredibly rude!  He should have told them he'd be with them in a minute instead of cutting us off.  He also never checked on us while we were eating to make sure everything was ok.

On to the food!  It was extremely underwhelming.  My husband got the burger special for the evening; it was a south west kind of burger with chipotle mayo and peppers.  There was no spice to it at all, and it was medium rare instead of medium well which is how my husband ordered it.  He also said it was really greasy.  I got the Zinburger with a grilled chicken breast instead of meat.  It was average, something I'd expect to get in a diner.  I was excited to try it since Manchego cheese is my favorite but I could barely taste it, the onions overpowered it.  We also got a side of sweet potato fries which were limp and soggy, and coleslaw which was average.  

I can't say no to banana cream pie, it's my favorite so I got that and my husband got a 50/50 (orange soda and vanilla ice cream.)  The pie was good, but the entire time we were eating dessert there was this awful burnt garlic smell assaulting my nose.  That kind of ruined it.  My husband didn't enjoy his 50/50.  All of that plus a soda and a drink with alcohol came out to $53.  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but be prepared for a long wait. Waited 50 mins with our party of 6 and were sat at a table intended for 4. We asked to be seated at a larger table that had just opened, and we were told that it was for another party of 6. Asked to speak to the manager and we were promptly moved. Food service is a big slow and we received the wrong side dishes initially, but mistakes happen and they were quick to correct issues."}
{"text":"The service, milk shake, and truffle fries bumped this from a 3.5 to 4 stars!

The Ahi Tuna salad was so-so, but I really should have gone with a burger. Next time I am in town, I will stick with the burger. The truffle fries were YUMMERS in muh tummers! And I had the Chocolate Zin Bar shake (I think that is what it is called). Chocoholics only for this one! It is a chocoholic's dream! I could not finish because I went a little heavy with the fries. 

The bartender was amazing! She is friendly and really on top of it. This is also in a great part of town. The atmosphere is fun too. More casual than most of the other restaurants around which is what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Service was very slow & the place was almost empty. Sent back cold fries & medium burger was very over cooked. For the price, very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Great place! Burgers are amazing, sides are just as tasty. Over all great atmosphere. We are outside, the patio was perfect for an Arizona winter evening. Servers and all staff were very friendly, fast and courteous. This is a place I take out of town guest, but I give this place 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for date night. Servers are always super friendly and on top of things. Decent beer on tap, cool indoor/outdoor bar feature, DELISH food.  Also lots of customization options for different dietary needs."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, an amazing, quality burger. The wait staff may be a bit homely but are really nice. Truly hearts of gold!"}
{"text":"Oh man...enough good things can't be said about Zin Burger on Camelback. Service is attentive and friendly, burgers, fries and mustard are out of this world. I include mustard because it is honestly the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has less than four stars. Great service and my wife and I loved the Sam burger. Only thing we would change would be to offer cheddar as an option versus just American cheese. Just personal preference from my wife and I. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why, but this Zinburger location is just tremendous. It's pricey for a straight burger, but I'd far prefer paying $10 for a Samburger than $5-$6 at Smashburger, or even Delux for that matter.

Believe me, it doesn't make me happy backing the Fox Restaurant empire, but the quality of the burgers/shakes/salads at this place are undeniable.

Pass on the chicken sandwiches, though. They're mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Delicious all around! If you in the mood for burger and beer or truffle fries, this is you spot. Their truffle fries man it's like heaven. I don't know why but, it is!!! Always ask for extra side of pickles too!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great experience.

The Place was clean and all the staff was super friendly. The ambience was mellow but it was pretty much packed and yet it was not incredibly loud that I was not able to hear the people I was with. 

The food fell nothing short of excellent, all of our burgers, sides and desserts were great. Everyone in my party was satisfied and happy with their respected plates.

Nothing negative about my experience.
I'll definitely have to go back and try more things on the menu and I will 100% recommend this place to people."}
{"text":"There are many ways to make a great burger. This place stands out by promoting the freshness and organic nature of their patties. This location is at a mall. Parking is a bit weird there is free parking north of it, but south of it you either have to get validated or valet. Choose wisely. We went on a Sunday for lunch and there were a lot of people there. We waited for about 15 minutes because we wanted to eat inside. The workers were dressed like they were on the farm, and the décor kind of matched that. The patio is shaded and had misty sprays on when the temperature gets too hot. The restrooms are very clean and have some interesting décor. You'll have to see it for yourself.

This place is known for their burgers and shakes. To start off we decided to share a salted caramel shake. The amount of the shake is good for one person, but you can also share it and still be satisfied. When it arrived, it was very thick and luckily they give you a spoon to go along with it. I decided to get the Zinburger ($10). It comes with Manchego Cheese, onions and mayo.  For $5 more, I decided to get my burger Kobe style, which is to use Kobe beef. We also ordered a truffle fries and loaded fries. The loaded fries came with bacon, cheese sauce, sour cream and chives. I preferred the truffle fries over the loaded fries. The fries were not as \"loaded\" as I liked them to be. I would have liked more sour cream with them. The truffle fries were great. You can smell them from a mile away and taste just as great. The burger was huge. The meat taste fresh and went well with the toppings. My one gripe with it is the bun. I felt that it was a bit dry and it was holding it back from being one of the great ones.

The service here is pretty good. Our waiter was friendly, kind and helpful with choosing what to order. She was quick to refill our drinks and our food was served in a timely fashion. No complaints there. Would I come back here again? Sure, if you're looking for a place in Phoenix to pig out then check this place out!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had.  the Fry's are the best..... the Bacon Bloody Mary's are super!  If you are in town you need to try this place out.  You will be very happy!"}
{"text":"I understand some people do not like the price of the menu items at Zinburger but lets face it, we are not going to McDonalds, it is a \"gourmet\" burger place, so expect to pay a little bit more.

On that note, I had the Turkey Sloppy Joe and I loved it!  The flavor was amazing and it was topped with a poblano pepper and pepperjack cheese!  The bread is lightly toasted and compliments the sandwiches great!

The fries are not bad, not really great but not bad.  Although the burgers are not huge like some other places (the grind), the flavors and the actual atmosphere is a lot better!"}
{"text":"Repeatedly amazing food & service. The El Diablo burger, zucchini fries & green chili fries are where it's at."}
{"text":"Zinburger is a must try. This is one of my family's favorite places to eat. Typically, my mom does not like to have hamburgers, but she loves the ones here. They also have amazing fried zucchini. I recommend to go during happy hour where the sides are half off and the plain burger is cheaper as well."}
{"text":"I went here recently after the wife went and said how incredible it was. We have different burger criterias though so I wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing anybody should know is this place isn't cheap so don't come here without expecting to pay close to $50 for a meal for 2. We had the loaded fries which for everything that was on it was lacking in flavor. It was a bit dull for \"loaded\" fries. Now the burgers. I guess the best the way to describe the burgers is that if you like burgers for the toppings then this is your place. If you like the taste of burgers then you might not like this place. The burger itself was pretty dull too. The toppings on the other hand are really good. I had the Samburger that came with bacon and thousand island dressing. Nothing great about it but the bun was very good. The wife had the breakfast burger with avocado and a fried egg. I had a bite and the avocado was delicious and the fried egg was cooked perfectly. My son had the plain kid burger and he loved it but he loved it for the bun and not for the burger. The $5 for the kids burger was a good deal I thought. Overall it was good but not sure it was worth the price. There is better burger places out there."}
{"text":"Love the Girl Next Door!  My fav drink!  Burger are to die for with carmelized wine onions."}
{"text":"When you specialize in something, then you should know it and do it well. This is the Zinburger approach to burgers. Our server, besides being very attentive and friendly, was also extremely knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients. It showed me that Zinburger really knows their burgers and takes the time to educate their staff. It also served to heighten my expectations...which weren't let down.

The quality of my burger was very apparent. The bun was fresh, the meat was high grade, and the other ingredients were also well thought out. I love when restaurants are meticulous with their creations. This is a superb burger, expertly prepared from the creation of the patty (not too compressed) to the cooking of it (a perfectly pink in the middle \"medium\" is what I ordered and received). Simply great.

The milkshakes are over-the-top rich and delicious--like eating whole pint of Haagen Dazs. We all shared one, and it was still overkill. Great tasting though.

The fries were a little \"meh\" to me. Not sure why. They were hot & fresh, but a little bland. I tried the Truffle Fries as well, and they were also a little boring. Maybe they should try a different kind of oil or potato...or both. They were decent fries, just not as \"top notch\" good as the burgers.

Lastly, for a \"burger joint,\" the service was excellent...to the point of fine dining type pampering. Very nice. Overall, I'm a fan. I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"When I first walked into Zinburger, I thought \"Wow, this is really nice place for a burger place.\" My boyfriend and I were immediately sat. 

Their menu is a very simple menu, along with their burgers, they offered salads as well. My boyfriend and I ordered the Kobe Beef burger and the Zinburger. The burgers don't come with fries, so we ordered the sweet potato fries with a yogurt dipping sauce. Our burgers were so juicy and full of flavor, I felt guilty for trying to eat the whole thing. But I ended up stopping myself half way through my burger just so I can enjoy their Creme Brulee milkshake, and let me tell you, it was well worth it!

Overall, I think it's a place you should definitely try when you're looking for a good gourmet burger. It was nice and quiet during the time we were there. It would be a great place to take your family."}
{"text":"My turkey burger was tasty, albeit a little too salty for me. However, our server, Javon, was very sweet and fast. She was also super accommodating and patient with our group of 6 who all wanted separate tabs. (You're a champ, Javon!) I got the Nutella shake, which was tasty! I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Phoenix and wanting a burger because both the food and service were good."}
{"text":"The food is really, really good...but it is overpriced - no question. Granted we had drinks and I ordered a float but $63 for lunch for two people is pretty outrageous. 

I enjoyed the overall experience but I can't say I'd be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"What started out as a potential mishap, ended up as a fantastic night. We had reservations at 6:15 and the table before us just would not leave. With starving kids and a big party, the manager and waiter were so gracious and they ok our drink order before we were seated, and when finally seated had  complimentary apps ready for us starving people. It was so unnecessary but they were so nice to us and Mallory our waitress is no doubt the reason we will be back. She was courteous, timely and just a great personality. Thanks Mallory! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Yum! I have never been disappointed here. Great menu and keeps it to the basics without overwhelming the customer with soo many choices.    The truffle fries are phenomenal. The Parmesan zucchini sticks are yummy! My burger was cooked great.  Great atmosphere, laid back vibe."}
{"text":"Zinburger is probably my favorite restaurant in Gilbert. The food is always amazing. The staff are super friendly. And the service is pretty quick. I LOVE the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and the loaded fries. They use the NoWait app here, which makes it really easy to see how long the wait is from home and put your name in line even before setting foot outside your house. They have indoor and outdoor seats, with a nice fireplace outside too. I would highly recommend you give Zinburger a try if you are in the Gilbert area!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been raving about this restaurant. He visited a different location with his mom and told me it's a must-try!

We went last night a few hours before closing. When we got there, the inside had a nice little set-up. Right now the shopping center is decorated with Christmas lights, so the outside of the restaurant is well light and quite pretty!

Anyway, inside the restaurant at the time, wasn't too many people inside. Just several small groups scattered -- seemed like a hit for a lot of Friday date night. :)

My boyfriend ordered the Bruce Lee hamburger and I ordered the Samburger with double truffle fries. I also ordered the cucumber mule (it's pretty much their version of the Moscow mule) and my boyfriend ordered one of their beers.

Our waiter was very friendly and checked in every so often to make sure everything was all right. He came back not too long after we ordered and explained he accidentally tossed our order away (well, the paper he jolted it down) and didn't want to mess up the order. So he came back to make sure he remembered it correctly.

I personally appreciated that gesture and found it sweet of him to double check! He came back not too long after again to let me know the bar ran out of basil and if I wanted to change my drink order.

I told him it was fine and I would have an \"old school\" mule. After he brought out the fries as an appetizer, our waiter came out with our drinks, including my mule which ended up having basil! The waiter mentioned how the bartender went out really quickly to grab basil, so that was a sweet delight! I thanked him and asked if he could kindly thank the bartender for doing that for me. 

The food was delicious! Not everyone is a fan of truffle fries, but I swear, their fries would make you reconsider how you feel about truffle fries.

The burger was full of flavor and not ridiculously big to where you can't even fit it in your mouth. It was the perfect size where it's just the right amount of food and not too big or too small.  

And you know the meal is great when you finish everything. (Okay to be fair, I couldn't finish the entire burger because I filled myself up on the truffle fries, but it was all worth it!  BUT, if I had the capacity to eat everything I would've!

All in all, delicious food and amazing customer service! We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The zucchini fries were amazing. We came during happy hour which was good because by the time we left the place was packed. On a Thursday! The kids meals came with a salad choice and a soft drink for only 5.00. Great value and the wine and beer was half price. I think we have a new favorite in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, got the blanco burger and I was in heaven, great service...will be going back for sure, and I'm not even a burger lover!"}
{"text":"While The Burger Guy will always miss LA, I am really learning to enjoy Arizona! With that said: Why can't I find one aged- beef burger in this godforsaken state!? Sorry, rant over. Seriously though. I have searched high and low and as far as I can tell, there are exactly zero places in the Valley that serve an aged-beef burger. So what does any of this have to do with Zinburger? Because despite not aging their beef, Zinburger is the closest thing I've found to the gourmet burger joints in LA that would serve aged-beef burgers.

The Burger - 8.5 (out of 10)
For my first time, I stuck with the classic Zinburger (I've since tried a couple more). I've often found that the burger places that have a bunch of different types of burgers fail to make any one of them good. Zinburger doesn't have this problem. There's about 10 different types of burgers and you'll find someone that'll rave about each and every one of them. I still want to try the Bruce Lee Burger (it won an award last year). Besides the lack of aged-bee, Zin has all the markings of a classic gourmet burger. Brioche bun, high quality beef, gourmet cheeses... it's all there. The beef has a really nice flavor, in the bun is really nice, although could be a tad bit softer. You can even customize your own masterpiece. Overall a great burger place and The Burger Guy's favorite gourmet burger in the Valley so far.

{"text":"Just left Zinburger to go to the theater.  First visit.  It was WONDERFUL service ( thanks Dakota). BEST chicken sandwich I've ever had and believe me I have had plenty of them as I don't eat red meat.  When it came out, server advised chicken breasts were running small so they gave me 2!!  So favorable and half price beer, wine, and sides til 6.  We got the onion rings which were wonderful!  Run, don't walk to eat at this place.  My bestie got a burger which she told me was very good and she ordered it well and said it was perfect and not dry!!"}
{"text":"This food was great!  Portion size was good.  I hope more Fox Concepts come to Gilbert.  A Culinary Dropout would be amazing!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fantastic selection of toppings. There is usually a wait to plan ahead if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband, BFF, and her boyfriend... It was crowded. The wait that was \"30 minutes\" ended up being an hour at least. And no one mentioned that it would be longer or anything like I don't know ... maybe something that would be the job of the hostess?  The employees here seem a bit... cardboard and detached from reality. Me and my best friend sat at the bar to wait (glad we did with the ridiculous wait) and the bartender never came around to ask if we wanted a drink.  My friend's boyfriend had to go all the way down to the other side to order a drink though the bartenders machine that he was staying at was right in front of us. The \"loaded fries\" were skinny tasteless luke warm fries with sour cream lightly drizzled on top of them with a dash of bacon and a pinch of chives... on top of some nasty cheese sauce that tastes like it came out of a can. Does that sound loaded to you? The burger was pink even though we asked for no pink. I found the burger to be vastly overrated and quite mediocre. Especially for the price. The egg was gooey tasting on our breakfast burger and the patty had no flavor but was juicy. The bacon added no flavor either but a slight crunch though the burger turns into a gooey, sloppy mess half way through. The bun was also basic considering the attempt of the establishment to appear 'high end'. And everything is 'a la carte' a fancy way of saying you are going to have to pay $7 for chintsy  \"loaded\" fries (because they don't serve fries with their $10 plus burgers) and $12.50 for the burger. The server was also not friendly and everyone who worked there had that aura of trying too hard which is never appealing. I won't go back here- this experience just sealed the deal."}
{"text":"SUNDAY FUNDAY..........WHY ON EARTH IS THE BAR FULL OF KIDS!!!!  I guess soda and milk shake tips rule over my Sunday alcohol consumption..........We'll move on down the road. Total of 8 kids sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Great food. And great server. A friend brought up an issue that occurred and the manager did not seem to care. She had no sympathy and blew the topic off subject. Clearly, she did not understand the context of what was going on. Besides that, definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"I love trying new burger places, I had the Samburger and I'm pretty sure it was the best burger I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Portions are HUGE! The taste is really something to experience with a hamburger, my wife and I really liked the atmosphere as we sat outside on the patio.  Great place for a nice date dinner!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for work and ordered the Clint's Almost Famous veggie burger for takeout. Best veggie burger I've ever had! I loved the assortment of veggies that they used to make the patty. The avocado was a nice add. Also ordered the spicy green chili fries, which were amazing! Really wish they had this place in NYC!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice. First let me tell you that this place is like a high end steakhouse ONLY in the aspect that you purchase the entree and anything else is extra. Buying a burger does NOT include fries or slaw. Now if you read my reviews, I have no problem dining and paying for dinners at high end steakhouses and paying for the sides. No problemo!
For a burger joint, it ain't gonna happen.
First time there I had the no bun burger and fries. Tasty but nothing to write home about. Tonight I had the zinburger and coleslaw. The zinburger was tasty. Coleslaw is coleslaw! To charge $3 for it...the cost of that is probably ten cents. I won't do that again.
I ordered a Absolut and tonic. They came back and told me they were out of Absolut and suggested Belvedere or Ketel. I told the waiter that I am not going to mix Ketel One so I'll have it on the rocks.  
The burger was tasty but not worth $10.50. I realize it is 100% Certified Angus Beef...but so is every burger that Carl's Jr. sells and they charge half the price and you get fries!!
My wife ordered the Wedge salad. They don't serve wedge salads. It was a chopped salad. 
The bill comes and my wife's house red wine was $8 and my Ketel One on the rocks was $10.50!! And it was a shitty pour!
You go to Donovan's for a great steak and you order a drink on the rocks and you pay but you get a righteous pour! 
We won't be going back to zinburger with Oregano's across the street."}
{"text":"I have been here twice the first time I got the Zinburger and aioli fries, which was delicious! I If go back I would order it again. The burger was cooked perfect and the flavors were great. The second time I got the chicken sandwich and I though it was  dry. I will definitely go back but will stick to the burgers.

Also If you go there for your lunch hour plan on taking a long lunch, we were there almost an hour and fifteen minutes."}
{"text":"Probably the best Shake I ever had (Strawberry Cheesecake), Pretty good burger, Double Truffle Fries were just ok. I will definetely return for the shakes, for Burgers I will probably go down the street to Delux..."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.... Had burger and fries very good. Sat on patio not a fan of being outside but the food and service made up for that. Whenever in Biltmore area I will stop here for a burger fix. Great location - gelato shop Frost is close by-"}
{"text":"While my turkey burger was good as well as the customer service..for the price it was very small. Next time when I want a good turkey for that portion size I will go to Smashburger or Red Robin."}
{"text":"If you go expect the typical Fox experience; ie, the focus is more on the concept and atmosphere and not on the food

Ups:
- Kobe burger (add the smoked bacon) cooked as requested 
  medium/rare
- nice bar with both indoor and outdoor seating
- plenty of patio seating
- milkshakes

Downs:
- $14 kobe burger (good but wouldn't order again)
- Buns don't work with the burgers both in flavor and texture.  same   
  wheat bun for all burgers. Toasting them would've helped
- ahi tuna burger needed some more flavor
- truffle fries were soggy and flavor was disappointing
- chicken salad with almonds, goat cheese, and pomegranate was 
  plain and wish had skipped
- nothing really unique about this burger joint
- $6 milkshakes (they don't put any bourbon or any liquor?)"}
{"text":"Housed in the Biltmore District in Phoenix, Arizona. \"Zinburger\" is a wine and burger bar for wine and burger connoisseurs alike. The restaurant is vastly open, welcoming, and equally trendy. Upon arrival, our party was greeted and informed that there was a slight wait of 20 minutes as expected during the dinner rush and happy hour. The host took a name down for our party and in turn we distracted ourselves by further examining the restaurant. The walls were brightly colored, with ample lighting while the tables and booths contrasted with a dark finish. The staff looked happy and were dressed in a uniform that was simplistic and neutral with an earthy shirt that read the restaurant name and a pair of blue jeans. Around fifteen minutes had passed and the host informed us of a table being available. Each member of the party was handed a menu that was simplistic, yet extensive with a myriad of combinations and selections of burgers, other small plates, and beverages. Our server, Denise had made her appearance within a minute and inquired if our party had ever been here before. Two of the four of had, so Denise explained to the other half of some of her favorite creations and about happy hour specials that discounted glasses of wine, sides, and fries by 50%. A major benefit to a price sensitive consumer. Taking advantage of the specials, each member of our party ordered a glass of wine that was respectable in size. Denise offered a little more time to peruse the menu and enjoy our beverages. Every item on the menu sounded delicious, especially since we were so hungry. I ultimately decided on \"El Diablo\", a burger that was served with jalapenos, caramelized onions, lettuce, and chipotle mayo. Even though each burger is served á la carte, a side order of fries or another side is necessary, especially at half off. Just like the burgers, the fries and sides are far from basic. My complete order was an \"El Diablo\" burger, cooked medium, with a side order of zucchini fries. Although, we anticipated a long wait for our food, just as we did to be seated. It was the opposite. Our food came out speedily and more importantly, correct. I looked at my plate which held a burger weighing in heavier than your average burger, plated with the zucchini fries that were dusted with parmesan seasoning that included ranch for dipping. I picked up the burger and took my first bite. The food was the prime temperature of being pulled off the grill, but not so hot to where I would regret taking the first bite within seconds of Denise excusing herself. The bun was nicely toasted and the burger offered a slow burn with a flavor as opposed to some foods that are spicy just for the sake of being spicy. I paced myself with a few of my fries that were an even and lengthy cut. Zucchini fries are an art form that seldom restaurants are able to master, because they cool so quickly and the breading tends to slip off. Denise came to check on us and joked the entire party was silent, so the food had to be good. The food was so good, none of us needed boxes. Overall, the entire experience was excellent. The food obviously being an important factor, but more often times than not service trumps food quality. Our server was polite and equally serviced each of her tables with an invisible hand. While Denise was present, it did not ever feel as if she was sitting at our table. Our waters never ran dry, she asked about possible refills when the other beverages reached a midway point, and never seemed elsewhere with her thoughts. The atmosphere, service, and ultimately the food is something sensational. My only regret is that I did not take Denise up on her offer of finishing our meal with one of their sweet offerings. Heed my advice, save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Food was good but I expect a side with a $12 burger. Portions were good. Prices were steep ($38 before tip for 2 burgers, one side of zucchini fries, and one beer). Service was asi asi. Won't go again."}
{"text":"I finally tried Zinburger for the first time today after having driven past it several times. It was lunch time and pretty busy crowd, but I was able to sit at the bar immediately. They had all the doors open and it was such a great, laid back atmosphere. I was served pretty promptly but the bartender. I had a create your own burger with american cheese and guacamole cooked medium well. The meat was cooked perfectly and the guacamole was creamy and flavorful. I also got a basket of fries, they were fairly good but I didn't realize that it was served in a huge basket so it made for a lot of fun. Overall, the food was delicious but a little pricey considering it's a burger and fries. They did have some amazing sounding milk shakes that I may have to try next time."}
{"text":"Holy cow. I've been to a lot of places and this one surprises the hell out of me. The \"Bruce Lee\" burger blew my mind and just the farm salad was so unique and delicious. If you are passing through old town Gilbert at night and are turned off by the noise and the line of Whiskey Row but want to enjoy the live music, Zinburger is a great stop for some bomb food and across the street entertainment."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Might be the best burger I've ever had! Created my own burger and got the truffle fries, delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I have ever had!  The Kobe burger is worth the extra $4 in my mind, and the truffle fries are legit.  Sure you're paying $20 for a burger and fries, but this is no normal burger.  Add a cold beer or a glass of wine, and you'll be wanting to come back right after you finish the last bite.  Why this place rates only 3.5 stars is ridiculous.  Every time I've gone on a non happy hour Sunday afternoon it's packed.  There's a reason for that;  its called 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few days ago with family and I got the Samburger with 1000 island without the bun and fries. It was messy but so GOOD!!! The location was wonderful and the ambience was beautiful. The staff was friendly and the place had awesome service as well."}
{"text":"Finished shopping and started to get hungry after a small breakfast at Lux... We stopped in for a quick lunch and for seated right away.  After we arrived within 5 minutes there were about 6 groups that showed up and they had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. 

I had the special of the week, burger with pastrami and coleslaw on rye.  It was a big burger and filled me up.  I liked it and prefer my burgers on bread slices instead of buns.  

Wife had the Zinburger, which was a regular cheese burger.  I tried both and liked the special of the week better.  

We split an order of truffle fries.  These were good as well.  They came with a dipping sauce that was tasty.  
Next time we will split a burger (a lot of people were splitting burgers) and try a milk shake.  Someone next to us had a bloody Mary with a slice of bacon in it and that looked good too."}
{"text":"Fun open atmosphere. Shake was great. Burgers are  way too expensive and sides at a la carte making the meal cost $18-20. Flies everywhere and VERY annoying. Get a fan system over the open bar and keep those pesky flies away from our food!!"}
{"text":"The best burger place I've had in a while! I really liked the truffle fries, even though they were slightly pricy."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food! Definitely coming back. So impressed with the customer service here. Jaime and Dave were exceptionally good! There was no wait time and food came out so fast and tasted so fresh. It was my mother's first time here and they walked her through the menu and even recommended some of their favorite things! They even gave me a soda to-go! Score!"}
{"text":"came her on saturday night around 9pm and the place was not packed which is a define plus especially after working a full day at the phoenix comic con, the last thing i want to do is wait for a table.  Got seated immediate by our server, she was extremely nice and provided great recommendations.

I ordered the el diablo burger, the nutella milk shake and the truffle fries. The fries were good but a little soggy, not sure if it was the truffle oil that made it soggy.  Nutella milk shake had a good mix of chocolate, hazelnut and toffee flavor, only suggestion would be that they provide a bigger straw becuase the toffee bits clog up the thin straws.  Ordered my burger medium, came out nice and hot and cooked perfectly.  Probably could have had a second burger but didnt want to be a pig."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for fantastic burgers! Super bright space and minimal decor. The service was polite, friendly, and very fast. 

I have to start by talking about this amazing chocolate shake. Seriously life changing delicious. So chocolatey and just the right texture, absolutely 10/10 would come back just for this yummy shake! Can not recommend it enough!! 

I also had the breakfast burger. Amazing! The burgers are flavorful and the toppings are thoughtful and add the the burger experience. The fried egg on top of it totally made it for me, the yolk was super runny and I love that. 

Also had the loaded fries. Omg. More fries than any one person could ever need especially in addition to the burger. But truly they were so good! Totally mouthwatering. The amount of cheese they put on them is insane and so good, and it's not overwhelming. I also tried the green Chile fries that my bf ordered and those were amazing as well! Super spicy in the yummiest way! 

10000% will be back here. This is a great spot for amazing burgers and more!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were in the mood for a burger, but wanted to try something new in the Mesa/Gilbert area, so we tried Zinburger in Gilbert.

It was happy hour when we arrived (5pm) but we were seated right away; the restaurant did fill up fairly quickly and they dimmed the lights soon after we were seated. I guess it was for \"ambiance\" but it was just annoying: the older couple at the next table had to use their phones to see the menu.

I tried the signature Zinburger ($10.50): Machego cheese, zinfandel braised onions, lettuce, and mayo. Weird combination. I had mine without the onions (I just don't like onions, nothing against these.) The manchego cheese was too mild and I couldn't taste it or really tell that it was there. The quality of the burger meat was good, all the condiments (lettuce and pickles as garnish) were of good quality, and the bun was good but a little soft for my tastes.

The wife had the Blanco burger ($11.50): Pepper Jack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, lettuce, and chipotle mayo. It tasted almost exactly like the burger she gets at Red Robin. She also had a chocolate shake at the $3 Happy Hour price (instead of $5.50.)

There were $5 Happy Hour burgers, too, but the waitress talked me out of it, saying it was about half the size of their normal burger.

The burgers are a la cart, no sides. A regular personal order of fries is $3, or a shareable basket for $5.50. As it was happy hour, the shareable basket was $3. That was a good amount of fries for two.

So, non-happy hour pricing would have been around $15 for a burger and fries. Happy hour saves you a couple of bucks if you share fries or want a shake. 

The burgers were good quality, and the kitchen got them out quickly and properly (both the orders and the temperature.) But they just weren't worth that amount of money. There are just too many good burger places around with a far better burger for far less (Haven Burger, Giant Hamburger, and Lenny's just to name a few local independent places.)

Our waitress was very good. She greeted us kindly, took our food allergies seriously, checked on us regularly, cleared our plates quickly, and brought the bill promptly.

At the prices, it should have been better. We won't bother to go back with so many other good places around."}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing!  I have to eat gluten free and they made every accommodation to make sure I didn't get sick.  I had a buffalo chicken sandwich on a gf bun, they had very unique and tasty fries and a variety of shakes to choose from.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I just visited here for an early dinner.  Our burgers were very good, and the zucchini fries were excellent.  It was a little pricey, approximately $43 for two including soft drinks.  I felt the service was a little slow for mid-afternoon, and the server didn't return to check on us or refresh our soft drinks after our meal was served.  We would return and try it again."}
{"text":"I ordered the medium well blue cheese burger without a bun and got a very sloppy/soupy rare burger on lettuce that had brown spots on it. Shame on you. I won't be back. For a burger joint you are horrible and very overpriced."}
{"text":"This place definitely was really accommodating last minute on a Saturday night. There were about 16 of us that needed a place to eat and they were able to get us in within two hour's notice. 

When we got there our table was still kind of trickling in and the server was definitely behind. I got the nutella shake and it was pretty amazing. I also got the sloppy joe turkey burger. It wasn't anything amazing but I couldn't resist a sloppy joe. 

The rest of my party was a little disgruntled with the server not being able to understand the drinks that were being order. Either that or the bartender wasn't too competent. One friend ordered a prickly pear and it wasn't nearly one. He stuck with it because he just wanted to get some alchy in his system. 

Another friend order a Kentucky Mule and it was a little drawn out. Just substitute the Gin with Bourbon! It's pretty simple. 

Kudos to the server for keeping her cool despite her frustration with taking on a large table at the last minute."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a Monday night,  was told there was a 30-40 minute wait which I found odd as I counted 8 empty tables inside and 6 on the patio.  But who knows, we decided to sit at the bar. Sat down and waited 10-15 minutes without even being acknowledged. The bartender was in an argument with the couple next to us about their bill. After trying to fix it for the second time , the girl bartender basically said F**k it, I will have to get the manger and stormed off.  Not a great endorsement for the restaurant.  We got up and left and went next door to a real restaurant with real customer service.   Not sure I will be back, so many other options in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Went to Zinburger for lunch today with about 10 people. Service and food was amazing. We all had a great time. Love this place. Janet T"}
{"text":"Came early Sunday afternoon with my wife and kids. The kids had the cheeseburger and chicken strip meal with strawberry lemonades. I had the breakfast burger, my wife had the zinburger. We shared the loaded fries.

The kids meals were good and had the right proportions. They finished all their food. The strawberry lemonade was tasty and fresh.

The breakfast burger fell apart before I had a chance to take a full bite. I think it had too much mayo. All flavors blended and we're indistinguishable.

The zinburger was good. I wish I had ordered that instead.

The loaded fries were too much considering the flavor of the burgers. We should have ordered plain fries instead.

Service was ok. The average age of the wait staff seemed to be 20, which wouldn't matter except for their lack of experience and attentiveness.

I gave it 4 stars because they have really good tasting food. You just have to be mindful of what you're ordering."}
{"text":"I went there just once this weekend to grab a couple burgers to go.  Everything was very good from the greeting at the front door, the friendly upbeat prompt greeting at the bar, and our exiting good bye from the hostess.  The burgers were awesome, it was definitely was I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Food was a little pricey but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a review that I have been putting off doing for a while. My wife and I visited a little while back. The customer service was good, the decor was okay, but the burgers just didn't wow me. 

The waiter was nice and there wasn't really a wait. It looks fresh and modern on the inside and there was ample seating. 

I ordered the El Diablo burger medium rare. It came out a little too close to well for my personal tastes, and it wasn't spicy. That was pretty much all I was really expecting from the burger. Medium rare and spicy, lol. It wasn't a bad burger, it just did not live up to my expectations. 

All in all this is a 3 -star place in my book, just A-OK. Not bad, not great."}
{"text":"After the management reach out to me and thanked me for the honest review my faith has been restored in Zinburger I've always like their food it's just been tough when you just want to sit down and have a quick drink hamburger"}
{"text":"We used to go to Zin burger for a great happy hour menu.  They have since changed their happy hour menu to a disappointing happy hour menu with just a few items.  It also seems every time we go, we send the fries back as they are always cooked in old frier oil, burnt, greasy, and have been sitting a while (cold).  I want to love it, but every time we go, it is getting worse and worse.  The staff did all they could by comping the fries and giving us desert, but unfortunately that will not be enough for us to return.  Bring back your old happy hour menu please, and make sure you know how to make good french fries every time aka: Change your oil out more often."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends to get a burger. They had a lot of opinions and even chicken sandwiches. We shared the truffle fries and the onion rings. We were sad the milkshake machine was down. Overall pretty good service. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I don't know what I thought this place was, but it went beyond my expectations.  One of the best burgers I have had in America, though still far from the best ever.  The burger patties are well proportioned and even the bun gets lots of attention.  Milkshakes are good without being overly sweet.  But a bit pricey.

All and all a great meal!"}
{"text":"I am at a loss for words... I would highly recommend that if you live in or are visiting Arizona, that you eat at Zinburger. Fair warning... it's pricey. My meal was 17 dollars for a burger and a shake and nothing else. However, forget that because once you dive in... it might be impossible to get back out. The burger (A Double (two thick hamburgers with two slices of American cheese (lettuce and onions optional))) was a tastebud adventure. Every bite I took was a delicious rollercoaster that had me swaying side to side. Let's not forget the Milkshake. I had their Butterfinger Milkshake... and I nearly collapsed over how delicious it was, albeit very messy. My friends ordered a basket of plain fries and loaded fries... and their seasoning is amazing. We asked for ranch to dip the regular fries in... HOME-MADE-RANCH. It was absolutely fantastic! 

Now that the important part is over... let's get in to the boring details. Service - Fast, Friendly, Hot (not important... but still a major plus.) Ambiance - Very Modern meets 50s Diner, and there was plenty of seating indoors and out. 

I would definitely like to go again and try a new burger! I would also like to try a glass of wine (or three) when I go next!"}
{"text":"Consistently the best burger you will find in Phoenix. My wife ordered the chicken sandwich and that was cooked to perfection. Fries were hot, crispy and not over seasoned.
Many burger choices here in town but the Zinburger is the most straightforward and delicious.
All the ingredients are a perfect blend- caramelized onion really adds flavor. Important note the bun is both flavorful- and equally important- holds up under the strain! 

Service throughout the place at the tables is attentive and friendly but this time we sat at the bar and enjoyed that too.

We have many place we can go- we choose to go to Zinburger"}
{"text":"The Chuck Norris burger is insanely good as are green chili fries. My wife ordered a plain and simple cheeseburger with plain and simple fries and it was plain and simple delicious ! 
Highly recommend- great service and food cooked perfectly 
 You gotta hit this place in the Scottsdale Quarter -"}
{"text":"Zinburger specializes in burgers. They offer a variety of burgers along with salads, appetizers, milk shakes and a few other items. The standard burger is a 6.5 ounce certified angus beef patty that is fresh ground in house two times a day (according to my waiter). This is a casual restaurant with wait service. They offer a full bar and have indoor and outdoor seating. They validate your parking so you can park for free for up to two hours in-front of the restaurant.

I decided to try the Bruce Lee Burger because it sounded delicious with Asian Slaw, Sriracha mayonnaise, Jalapeños, Avocado and a few other things. It also was noted on the menu that this Bruce Lee Burger was a WINNING Burger in last year's \"Burger Battle.\"

I received my burger and the plate was garnished with a few what seemed like freshly made pickle slices that were tasty. I go to take a bite of the burger. I can't bite into it because it's to wide for my mouth. I remove half the bun and I have to eat it open faced with a knife and fork. It's mighty delicious and still a big sloppy mess. The burger has a tasty caramelized outside and the inside is big with flavor. All together they made this taste like the best potsticker with dipping sauce I ever had. Did I tell you that this is really messy and juicy? This is messy but really good. You might not want to eat this on a first date or in-front of your in-laws. You need to eat this burger by yourself or only with someone you can fart with.

My husband had the Diablo Burger. He was pleased with the burger. They cooked it medium rare like he asked for and he said it was the best burger he's had out in a while.

We were happy with the burgers but service wasn't perfect. We planed to share a salad that didn't arrive before the burgers or with the burgers so we brought it up with the waiter. The manager generously ask us to take the salad home for free but we declined. It turned out for the better because the burgers ARE VERY FILLING. Both of us were full and really couldn't eat anything else anyway.

The only other thing I'm not completely happy with is the decor. The place is nice but they have a big picture of beautiful cows in a pasture. It makes it hard to stomach beef when you gaze at the beautiful cows.

Anyways-

If they prepare the Bruce Lee and Diablo Burger the way they prepared ours was I can say they were really delicious burgers that you should be happy with."}

Zinburger - 5 Stars
Double Truffle fries - 3 Stars 
Salted Caramel shake - 1 Star 
Customer Service - 5 Stars 
The burger was delicious in every way, it may have just been the BEST burger of my life! I prefer the truffle fries from hopdoddy! That shake was the worse - FLAVORLESS!!! The service was friendly and professional!

I will be back fit just the DELICIOUS burger!!!!

7/3 
Zinburger -  5 Stars 
Double truffle fries - 4 Stars

So originally only gave 3 Stars, have since changed to 4. I think that first time was just an off batch with the fries. Now I think they are equally as good as Hopdoddy if not better."}
{"text":"This was our second visit.  Our first was an excellent intro.  Service was very good and the burgers first rate - meat was cooked properly, tender and with enough char to make a pleasant crunch.  The sweet potato fries were crisp on the outside and mellow within.  Very much a pleasant burger experience.  This second visit was disaster.  The food remained as above but  the service dropped like a rock.  After waiting an interminable time we had to flag a passing waitress to call our to take our orders.  That done, we then began another wait for our food to arrive.  Enough to say it arrived well after other patrons who arrived well after us had been served.  It appeared our waitress was more interested in developing her social skill than in serving the patrons . Needless to say we felt both ignored and abused.  More of this and Zinburger might find it's business rapidly falling off.  They just lost two who thought they had found Phoenix's burger place."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a good burger. Zinburger has never let me down.

This was my first time at the north Scottsdale location. Tucker into the Scottsdale quarter right by the splash pad. They have a good amount of outdoor seating which will b nice in the winter...not so much now.

We started with a few orders of fries. We had the zucchini fries and the double truffle fries. The zucchini fries are awesome. The truffle fries were tasty but a little greasy. No such thing as a bad fry....

For burgers I went with the breakfast burger (I always do). It's back, cheese, a fried egg and avocado. Soooooo good.  Hard not to make a mess while trying to eat it but hey, the price you pay for deliciousness. 

My wife had the veggie burger which she stated \"it's good\". I will take her at her word.

We were too full to do any desert. Plus it's lunch time.

Next time you're craving a good burger, zin won't let you down."}
{"text":"Burgers= one of my favorite food items! Be prepared to pay a pretty penny for a burger but they are very delicious! The zucchini fry appetizer is wonderful and the banana split milkshake is the best milkshake I've had!! Be prepared to wait for a seat, especially on the weekends or at dinner time. Service is a bit on the slow side but I assume it is all part of the casual and trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in and tried both their sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Much fonder of the sweet potatoes & the others were a little heavy?!   Like previous posts I was not to fond of their dipping sauces either.

Loved their freshly prepared lemonade and the great outside spot to people watch!"}
{"text":"Get the Kobe Beef Burger Zin style. The truffle aioli fries. The Kit-Kat shake. This place is not cheap. But for what you get it is the best of the best. Every time we go here, its an exciting. We call their kobe burgers butter burgers. They truly melt in your mouth without even a need to chew on them. OMG. We just went 2 days ago. All we have been talking about is when are we going again?????"}
{"text":"Came into Zinburger Gilbert while vacationing from Ohio! Loved the atmosphere! My husband and I decided to sit at the outside bar! We started off with a Prickly Pear Margarita and a Deschutes Fresh Squeeze! The margarita was one of the best margaritas I have had on vacation! So good I had two! The IPA was great as well! For an app we got the loaded fries! They were really good! The cheese sauce was fantastic and who can say no to bacon? We then split the Zinburger. It was a very simple burger, but it was very good! Our bartender was Abby! She was wonderful and really helped us with our choices! Her margarita was FANTASTIC! Great food and excellent service! We will be back next time we visit!!"}
{"text":"Good food, *excellent* service, simple clean atmosphere.

I had lunch here with a couple co-workers yesterday while training at their office.  It is apparently one of their favorite places to go for lunch.  I had a Zinburger (Med-rare... which it was!), zucchini fries, banana  cream pie, and coffee(s).  All were excellent.  The waitress was professional, prompt and friendly.  I missed her name, but I think I recall she said she was from Florida.  She apologized that they only had small regular coffee cups, but compensated by bringing me two and rotating replacements.  I thought it was a GREAT idea (and helped with my jetlag).

Pricing was fair, food quality was good; about appropriate for this area.  My personal preference would be a touch more batter on the 'fries' and the addition of a sauce.  The burger bun could be toasted or maybe changed out for a bun with more structure; it didn't survive the zin-sauteed onions without going soggy. More bananas and cream and less whipped cream and caramel on the pie (good crust though!).  The waitress mentioned they do a good key lime pie.... I'll try that next time.

I would definitely suggest this place to friends and hope to go there again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Zinburger for the first time today. We had heard of this place before but never really thought about stoping. It was great! Great food and great service. They were really fast at bringing our food and food delicious. It's family friendly, they have televisions to watch the games, there is a nice outside area and everything is really clean. We enjoyed our dinner and We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer and hast kids meals! The boys love the shakes. It is a little pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"Only had zucchini fries to hold me over for dinner. Really excellent though!  Good food server didn't mind me occupying a table for a simple request. Great attitude."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger in town with avocado and sprouts it is delcious!!  Go early getting a table is tough once happy hour hits but also had a great bar area.  Other little secret is that their chocolate cream pie is the best in town.  Seriously,  definitely order it or make a trips just for it.  Also,  good wines, of course.
As far as kids go I think it depends on the time of day.  It has milkshakes and good burgers for kids but in the evenings has more of a bar vibe."}
{"text":"My work crew and I have ordered take out from Zinburger several times now. The burgers are great but undercooked every time we order. We have now learned that you need to order medium well in the hopes of getting a medium to medium rare burger. One of the girls I work with orders well done and still has pink in her burger. Great ideas and flavors on the burgers and fries, but they really need to learn to cook them properly."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal at Zinburger. The burgers were huge and very tasty. Tender and juicy. I had the My Boy Blue and loved it. The mix of A1 and blue cheese was fantastic! I love me some fries and the many fries they have to choose from are all wonderful. The Double Truffle Fries were my favorite and the Spicy Green Chili Fries had a wonderful zing to them."}
{"text":"Initially I was looking forward to dining here given some of the reviews. It's a shame as the burgers and fries are very good. 

We put our name in for 3 and were told a 30-45 minute wait. As I looked around the restaurant there were a number of tables open. We waited patiently, but soon figured out that they were forcing the \"line\". When we were seated, they walked us to the back of the restaurant only to find that they had over 6-8 four toppers open..... So much for no tables available. : (. 

Our server, Katie, was friendly, pleasant, and attentive to our needs, checking in on us throughout our meal, refilling beverages and so on.   

The burgers and fries are great, but the customer experience needs some finesse."}
{"text":"So overall it was pretty good but the portions of one of our items was very underwhelming.  Two of us ordered the California bowl with Salmon and it was NO bowl. The salmon portion was lunch size at best.  I ended up leaving hungry.   I would compare to a bowl at true food which is truly a bowl.  This was just meh.   This wasn't even close to a $16 plate."}
{"text":"Delicious burger perfectly cooked. We ordered burgers and onion rings. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Love the vibe and atmosphere of this place. Next time I will try the tuna."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I can't get enough of gourmet burgers and fries, truffle fries at that!  I love when I can get a burger with avocado, different cheeses besides cheddar, roasted red peppers and tell them how I want it cooked.  The truffle fries are a must!  And I wouldn't leave without getting the salted creme brulee milkshake, but split it as it is pretty large and rich.  I loved that the interior of this place was so modern, but they still had a bar where you could and they had the Monday night football game on.  This burger joint is fancier than most, but prices match the experience you will have and quality of food you will get.  Would go again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Zinburger. I heard great things about it and I was looking forward to it.  Zinburger was a disappointment for me.  

First, the pros: great atmosphere, good selection of delicious sounding shakes, good service. I'm not an alcohol drinker, but the selection of wine and craft beers seemed to be very above average.  Really cool salt and pepper combo shaker-grinder!

Now the cons: I ordered the Samburger, a typical 1000 Island burger.  The bun looked good, but it was underwhelming.  A good bun, for me should be light and soft and airy.  This one was thick, dense, hard, cold and untoasted.  There was barely any 1000 island on the burger.  It looked as if someone put 1000 island on the bun and attempted to scrape it all off with a knife.  Lettuce, tomato and pickle were good. Beef seemed like high quality, however the cold, dense bun really ruined the burger as the whole burger didn't seem to have the right temperature. Burgers are expensive, $12-$15 with a side dish costing extra.  I drank water, my wife drank a soft drink and we got a piece of pie. After tipping, our ticket was $61.  

For the amount we paid, we could have gotten a much better dinner. There are certainly better burgers out there.  Go for the atmosphere and get a shake, but know that I've had better burgers at In n Out!"}
{"text":"Yumma, yumma, YUMMY!! 

I was at the Biltmore and craving a hamburger for lunch.  I decided to stop in at Zinburger.  The place was packed ; however, I found a spot at the bar and within 15 minutes the bartender took my order and my burger was right in front of me.  I ordered the Zinburger.  The burger was cooked to perfection.

I will definitely be back and I will bring others to enjoy Zinburger's wonderful burgers."}
{"text":"My buddy, Jeff K., gave this place glowing reviews and recently got me to go and try the burger. wow. 

Places like Fez, Switch, Stax, etc, seem to rely on the sauce and fixin's...Zinburger relies on its meat.  They LEGITIMATELY \"cook to order\" and the toppings are fairly simple...nothing new...but the quality of meat makes the burger as \"mouth-wateringly\" delicious as a burger can be.

It doesn't get my full five stars, because paying a minimum of $10 for a burger (and NOTHING ELSE on the plate) is a bit ridiculous in a town where quality burgers are being sold on specials for between $3 and $5 WITH fries or salads!

Methinks the Fox restaurants are just a TINY bit pretentious."}
{"text":"I first experienced Zinburger in Tucson, of all places, and I loved it. I went as often as I could when I was in town. It was hands down my favorite place to eat in Tucson, and I was itching for it to move to Phoenix.

On my first visit to Zinburger, my vision of the perfect burger meal shattered. The place itself is wonderfully stylized and the staff are perky (but new), but the food was disappointing. On my first visit, I had a glass of Reisling, and the Zinburger, and my favorite truffle fries. The Zinburger was greasy and the bun was soggy when it came out, and the fries weren't as tasty as I remember them being in Tucson. But since I loved Zin so much, I wanted to give it a second chance.

I met up with a friend for happy hour (wait, no happy hour at a burger and \"wine\" bar?!) and tried to play it safe with the Plain and Simple burger. The fries were tastier this time, and the server was happy to split the Bananas Foster shake (which was very yum) but the burger just did not deliver. It wasn't soggy this time, but rather... normal. Nothing special. I might as well have been at Denny's.

The staff, on the other hand, seemed very knowledgeable and friendly, but that doesn't change the disappointing food.

I will probably give Zin ONE MORE CHANCE.... I just can't get over how heartbreaking the food is compared to the Tucson one. But I'm not about to drive 2 hours just for a burger!"}
{"text":"This cool place is located in the same shopping center as Barrio Queen.
Zinburger is an upscale burger joint offering a full bar and plenty of different burgers to choose from. 

Most burgers are in the $10 range for Angus Beef, Kobe Beef is available for an additional fee.  We started out with an order of Green Chili Fries which were outstanding!  The fries were extra crispy and the diced green chili's were amazing.  If you come to Zinburger, you had better order the Green Chili Fries!

Since we were all impressed with the Green Chili Fries we naturally ordered a burger featuring green chili's!  The Diablo was a big Fail.  The burger was way to soft and pretty much fell apart when we bit into it.  Picture three grown men trying to eat their burgers with a knife and fork LOL.

Service was fair overall, a second order of fries arrived very late and only after we asked for them twice.  Hopefully Zinburger's other burgers are better than the Diablo, but the Green Chili Fries are worth a visit on their own merit."}
{"text":"Great burger, great fast service and a delicious Bloody Mary!  Our waitress was friendly and she brought our drinks out right away. Even the barbecue sauce to dip the crispy onion rings was good. Not too tart or tangy but a good BBQ flavor."}
{"text":"My last visit to Zinburger was disappointing, but boy did they make it up! The Wagyu burger was absolutely delicious! The wild mushrooms were cooked to perfection and really took the burger to the next level.

I also tried the Classic Diner Burger. The name says it all! Takes you back in time to an old 50s diner. The patties on this particular burger are thinner than the others, so I recommend making it a double, but overall -- really good.

Zinburger also lets you substitute the wagyu patty on any burger!

I did notice they removed the Breakfast Burger from the menu, but you can still order a fried egg in the Build Your Own Burger section.

Very glad I gave Zinburger another chance!"}
{"text":"Super tasty food, incredibly friendly staff. Order the truffle fries - yum yum! The prices are also reasonable. We will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here the other night and had a great experience! Our waiter was super nice and answered all of our questions. We asked for a recommendation on the double truffle fries and he asked if we wanted to try a sample. I thought that was awesome! Great customer service. They were good, but it took a little bit to get used to the taste. We ended up getting the loaded fries which were AMAZING. We got two burgers and split them between us so that we could both try them. The blanco burger was so good. I wasn't a fan of the other one...I think it was called western chicken or something like that. It was super deep fried which I am not a fan of. It was also pretty loud in there, which I understand because of the popularity. Overall great experience! A little pricey, but I will most likely be coming back."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered take out here was during the lunch rush and the service was great, I couldn't have asked for better, they even waited for me to get there before getting my lemonade so the ice wouldn't melt, but I wasn't on Yelp at that time, so I couldn't review it.

This time, we called in at 8pm for take out, were told we were going to be connected to the bar to have them take our order, so we hung up after 5 minutes of being on hold, and went to Delux instead."}
{"text":"Oh Zinburger....why can't you open a location in Orange County??? You were the best thing to hit Scottsdale and left a tear in my eyes when I had to leave you. The best burgers...the best fries...the best milkshakes... You deserve more than 5 stars.
I miss you!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a casual brunch/lunch.  Got seated at the bar before 11:30.  By 11:45 the wait was 30 min on Sat. very good Bloody's.  Personable service.  Fresh air.  Veg burger sans bun was very nice."}
{"text":"Blah! Nothing great. Was expecting a better experience, ZERO genuine guest engagement from bartender, I can get better guest experience at a national chain. Nothing here to draw you back in."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now. Both times the food was great, service was on point and they were more than willing to allow us to bring a small cake in for my daughters birthday. Great with being gluten conscious."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Really nice atmosphere. We all really liked the food. Drinks were great. The watermelon mojo to was so good"}
{"text":"The burgers are excellent and service was great! I Recommend this place if your in down town Gilbert!"}
{"text":"5 stars for stellar burger and fries!

I heard mixed reviews from several folks I know, about Zinburger.   As a result, I was hesitant to \"waste\" a rare opportunity to dine alone with my husband on a place that would be 'just OK'.

THEY WERE WRONG.

We got there on a bustling Friday night.  After being quickly seated, our very cute waiter (hey, i can look!) took our drink orders and swiftly fetched a few samples of beer when my dinner companion hesitated with his choice.   Good call!

We ordered some truffle fries immediately, as an appetizer and were they ever delicious!  Super hot, thin, crisp- just the way a fry should be.  

We did dining role reversal- i ordered the beef, and he the salad.

I selected the \"Samburger\", subbing cheddar for the American cheese, and my husband selected the Seared Ahi Salad.  

I had a little of the salad and it really was excellent.  The Ahi was cooked correctly  and the salad had a perfect balance of flavors.  But I came for a burger, not a salad- just sayin'.

The burger was sublime.  The bun was perfectly complementary, not a big blob of industrial bread.  The fixins were all fresh and delicious.  The bacon was thick and crisp, the beef was obviously fresh ground and hand-shaped, not packed into a brick by a machine.

I LOVE me a good burger, and I'd rather have a knockout $10 one every now and again than some mediocre pile of calories.  This burger was worthy.  

Only because I love him did I let my husband have a little of the burger.  That was a mistake because he immediately developed Food Envy.  I had to guard my burger after allowing him that first taste.  I DID warn him, before he ordered his excellent salad, that this place specialized in BURGERS and that he would surely be sorry.  And he was.

DEFINITELY go to Zinburger. Savor a knockout burger and fries.   If you don't eat beef or are a disciplined dieter, you will enjoy the Ahi Salad."}
{"text":"The manager contacted me about my experience. So I need to take the time to send an update. I have not been back to the restaurant, so this review is not for the food, but for the customer service. Since she took the time to reach out to me, and attempt to make my next experience better, I have upgraded my review to 4 stars. I will be back to try again."}
{"text":"Fox got it right, again!  If you're looking for a cool, trendy, open/airy place to eat, Zinburger's an awesome spot!  On a recent trip, I had the Zinburger signature burger which was moist, tender and flavorful.  Even the soft, yet sturdy, bun was good!  The Sweet Potato Fries came with a yummy Yogurt Dipping Sauce; totally worth the extra $5!  To drink consider the well-poured Lemon Sipper (Skyy Vodka, Mint Leaves, Lemonade) to cool off on a hot, Phoenix day.  I ate indoors, but they have a wonderful, relaxing patio, too.  This place is great for lunch with girlfriends after a day of shopping, but equally as fitting for a Saturday night date.  Kids are welcome, but they'd probably be happier at Mickey D's down the street."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but overpriced so-so food.  Our visit this week was highlighted by limp mushy fries and undercooked beef.  Won't break our necks getting back to this joint."}
{"text":"I stopped by with my date last night and our waitress, (forgot her name) took a little longer than usual to get to us. The food was excellent! I ordered the double and it was very juicy and flavorful. We had asked our waitress for an extra ketchup that we never got to use because she didn't bring us one. Also waiting an uncomfortable amount of time getting a refill on our waters. Other than poor service, the food was great and a nice quaint place to eat."}
{"text":"Very Cool place. Been liking this place since 2012. Sat at the bar today so I can watch the game more closely, I always get the turkey burger EVERY time , but today I decided to stretch my tastebuds. I ordered the \"My boy blue burger\" and I must say it was DELICIOUS  ,  just had water because I was disappointed with the draft choices, They were not very good choices. They have a bar but it's NOT a bar. This is NOT the place to watch a game at all, the TV were turned all the way down, and they were playing music, so I had to watch the game with no sound , do you know how frustrating that is? 
Food = 5
Service = 4
Ambiance = 3

{"text":"We've got a burgeoning burger corridor here.  What 15th Century Florence was to the Renaissance is what the Biltmore area has become for the next generation gourmet burger.  

I'm typically not too hot on most Sam Fox restaurants but this is one of the exceptions.  Sure it has the style and flair of its other restaurants.  But it also has a menu that matches the concept.  The burgers are executed flawlessly and they are just unique enough to distinguish them from their Biltmore neighbors.  The shakes were as decadent as weekday matinee, not at all necessary but very tasty.   The fries were great although we thought that the yogurt sauce pairing with the sweet potato fries was a little off.

Top off the experience with some incredible service by our waiter who had the same look and enthusiasm as the indefatigable Steve O and you've got a memorable experience.  The burger gauntlet has been laid and all worthy participants should report to the Biltmore."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this Zinburger location on a Tuesday afternoon. The service was very good. We both liked our server. He was helpful and professional. We both had the Zinburger cooked rare. They did an excellent job cooking the burgers to a medium rare for my husband and a true rare for me. The burgers were truly delicious made with fresh, high quality ingredients. We also shared a basket of sweet potato fries. They were served hot and fresh, but I found them to be nothing special. My husband had a draft porter from the bar during Happy Hour (3 - 6pm), so it was half off. I would recommend Zinburger."}
{"text":"The flavor of the food may have been there but it was completely lost because of our very poor service. Had heard that this place was worth dining at so went with a group of friends last night. Wasn't an extremely busy night. We placed our order which included drinks, salads, burgers, fries. Drinks arrived but had to request twice to have water for all diners. Burgers and fries arrived but no salads. After waiting a while with no salads canceled their order. Primary wait staff parson was inattentive and when we pointed out that salads never arrived she blamed the kitchen. Bill arrived and the canceled items were not removed. We requested a revised bill and she blamed someone else for that error. Paid our bill and relayed to manager on duty our poor service. Listened attentively but seemed to be dismissive of my concerns. Won't be rushing back, plenty of other establishments to choose from."}
{"text":"There are so many new and exciting restaurants coming to Gilbert and Zinburger is just one of them.  For so long, there was a limited amount of restaurants in this downtown area and now, there are a bunch to choose from.  

Zinburger is a lovely decorated restaurant with a shabby chic feel.  It is an open air concept with a nice outdoor patio and a large dining room that has windows that can completely open to the outside for that open air feel so even if you aren't outside, you feel as though you are.  The bar is nice and large and I can see coming here to spend time at the bar as well.  

The burgers here are what I would call a gourmet burger without being stuffy.  I am really picky about my burgers but these are really good.  The taste is just right and there isn't any gristle.  The fries are hand cut and tasty as well and can be shared.  The only thing I thought it lacked was a little presentation.  The burger was literally on the plate with nothing else.  It looked lonely.

Service was very good and we were able to spend some time without feeling like we were being rushed.  I will definitely be back to Zinburger.  It is a nice place to meet up with friends!"}
{"text":"We went during happy hour, had the loaded fries for half price....super good! Im your typical burger person, but the breakfast burger caught my eye so i ordered it and i could not be happier! Their shakes ate delicious too!"}
{"text":"Is at at the bar alone.  Didn't expect service to be especially good but she was very nice.  Burger came out in a decent amount of time. Looked good but there was a hair, which understandably you shouldn't expect but it happens.  They quickly changed it out and brought me a new burger but my appetite was done by then after the zucchini friends and wait.  I like is place and will go back.  Good vibe. Nice selection."}
{"text":"First off. To be fair the wait staff was great. That is where it ends. Food is flavorless on a sweet hawaian bun that does not stand up. I ended my burger with a fork. Drink took 15 minutes to come. Onion rings already gone and burger in front of me before my beer arrived. I am in the hospitality business and therefore can tell you where they are falling down. Inexperienced children are running the show. They are too busy beong cool and no one is watching the details."}
{"text":"Met up with friends here for dinner & had a great time! Our server, Jessica, was the absolute bomb! Great service, friendly, super helpful & fun! The fries (yes, we had multiple types) were delicious & I'm in love with their zucchini fries! Burgers were good, but not out of this world for me. Love that they have gluten free bun options! My reason for giving it 4 vs. 5 stars is just that I would return for the fries rather than the burgers and well, it's a burger place so I expected to love it. Still a great place & will definitely return"}
{"text":"Very good burger. The fries were awesome. The place had a good vibe....maybe a little loud. Price is right."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Zinburger.

Whatever.  12 dollars for a burger.  But it's an amazing burger.  I don't know why so many people are crying about the price... don't go?  Or go during happy hour to save a few bucks?  Who cares if they don't include fries in the price, ya cheapos.  

We sat at the bar & had a beer.  This was the right choice.  Great people watching & were well attended to.

Zucchini fries.  YUMM.
Loaded fries.  Even better.

We split the breakfast burger... which had a fried egg, bacon & avocado... it was melt in your mouth good.

Their bloody mary was just... mehh.  I appreciate putting bacon on everything but it tasted like canned tomato juice.  Won't be ordering that ever again.

Other than that, great place!"}
{"text":"After much debate on this important issue of our times, I believe Zinburger is the best burger in town.  Saturday reaffirmed my belief.  The casual restaurant is bright and open, but you're not there for the ambience.  The menu is confusing, but you can basically order exactly what toppings you'd like a la carte without busting your wallet.  (That includes substituting a chicken breast or turkey patty.)  I recommend havarti cheese and either avocado or fried egg, but not both.  The egg brioche bun is large, but it's almost necessary to sop up all the moisture and flavors.

And the fries and sides stand up to the burger.  We ordered our favorite, zucchini fries.  That's healthy, right?  Not really, but the battered, fried zucchini sticks sprinkled with parmesan are amazing.  The onion rings suffered by comparison, but they were also more than adequate.

We were too full for shakes on this visit, but I can assure you that they're also delicious.  My one issue with this place is that it's hard to finish a burger without it falling apart.  Maybe that's a result of my topping choices.  That's a small burden to bare... I'll bring a bib and a dropcloth for burgers this good."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch here at Scottsdale Quarter was very busy. Tons of kids and very noisy atmosphere in the main room. Had the Zinburger.  It was a good size burger and very filling. The carmelized onions are good but wish it had a bit more veggies. Could use some kick, should have asked for some siracha. Wife had the wedge salad which oddly wasn't a typical wedge in the it was chopped up. She enjoyed it so thumbs up there. Everyone raves about the green chili fires so we shared an order. It is basically fries with some chopped green chilies sprinkled over it and some type of sauce on it. Good but not earth shattering. Service was good but overall nothing to bring me back. Perhaps I need to try something different."}
{"text":"I have never had something here I didn't like.  Zinburger serves consistently good burgers and food, and has a great atmosphere and service.  Never disappointing."}
{"text":"The burgers were juicy and good, but nothing truly extraordinary.  Also, the fries seemed a lil limp and greasy, but tasted fine. On the other hand, the milkshakes here are soooo amazing!!!!!! I slurped down the whole thing before are meal was delivered.  I ordered the Creme Brulee shake and my bf ordered the Cookies n Cream.  They are very filling and we would come to Zinburger just for the shakes :) Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for quick bite at Zin Burger in Gilbert! Ate at the bar.Food was excellent as usual and the bartenders we superb! Thx for great experience!!!"}
{"text":"If you have a hankering for a hamburger, there are better places that satisfy. We waited about an hour, and with all the hype we thought it would be worth the wait. Boy, were we wrong. Not only are they way understaffed (we watched three tables sit for about 20 minutes each after the people had left, meanwhile there are only two families waiting. We could have been seated way earlier...their staff seems too young and oblivious), their food didn't live up to the hype. Their burgers were not wonderful (fast food burgers are actually better) and their spicy cheesy fries were coated in msg (we got a headache two hours later). We don't drink, but were left wondering if all the hype is really about their 100's of wines (their wine menu was about two inches thick). Save your time and money. The service was slow too, so it's about three hours of my life I won't get back."}
{"text":"Took out of town friend here and although it is a small place they managed to seat us all in an appropriate time. They did a great job with serving such a large table. The burgers are very good, temperatures were all right and the share fries are a great way of serving the side. My daughter had the veggie burger which she says was wonderful, which is rare. And when they say spicy they are serious, which is wonderful change since so many times you order spicy only to be disappointed and adding Tabasco."}
{"text":"Excited for a Fox restaurant to come to Gilbert  First, the service was excellent. Atmosphere was not warm, but it was enjoyable. We had burgers, one basket of onion rings a glass of wine each and some iced tea Burgers came out the way we ordered and were yummy, onion rings were crisp and good but nothing special. We enjoyed the meal but it's a little high priced for a burger night out. With tip over $60. It's a tasty and fun place but a serious dent in the average budget   The bathroom being outside was weird."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night for the first time hoping to beat crowd from golf tournament.  My friend pre ordered zucchini fries as I mentioned someone said they were good.  They were very good but maybe just a little too salty.  The dip was also good but you didn't receive but a small amount.  Next time ill get more.  We both ordered burgers and the small order of French fries.  The fries were a good si e for 2 being we had the zucchini as a appetizer.  Can't say i was impressed with the burger.  It was cooked to my liking but was not hot and actually had no flavor.  Bun was soft and fresh but all around for the burger things were just bland.  I would not go back for another burger unless it was on happy hour.  Price for it is too high.  Would go just for zucchini fries if i was in the area.  Sorry but there are better burgers elsewhere for the money."}
{"text":"Delicious fries, delicious burgers and perfect portion sizes.  The previous reviewers are correct, the prices are a bit steep but if you are looking for a tasty treat, you should really check this place out.
We started with the loaded french fries and the zucchini fries.  Both were absolutely delicious.  Ordered my daughter a cheeseburger with sweet potato french fries and she ate almost all of it.  Obviously a delicious burger as she can be pretty picky.
The hubby and I both got burgers which were the perfect size and VERY flavorful.  MIL also commented that she could still taste the amazing flavors after the meal which is a big win.
If you're not put off by a hefty price tag you should definitely try Zinburger."}
{"text":"First timer here, we've been wanting to come here for a little while. From the reviews it seemed like we needed to get here early. Luckily for us we're old ppl trapped in young bodies so we tend to go out very early so we didn't have any issue with seating, of course this was at 16:00. 
The staff gets a 5 star for being awesome. The burgers were good, but for $11-15 by themselves I'm not too sure. Maybe I'll try the kobe beef next time. The shakes are pretty good too. Out of the whole thing I'd say the fries and shake were our favorite. We will definitely swing in for the shakes and the loaded fries (we didn't get the loaded this time)."}
{"text":"Went to Zinburger looking for a casual lunch. We were seated outside quickly and the sever took our drink orders right away. We ordered the burger bowl (which was a burger without a bun) and thoroughly enjoyed it. Fresh avocado, vegetables, and a squash mixture was included. It was fresh and felt light. One order of fries was enough for the three of us to share. Enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places I have been to so far.

Ambience looked super cool and busy. 
Ordered - 
El Diablo with veggie Patty - tasted really fresh and good. Fills your stomach like crazy good. They don't offer fries on the side so.. Meh. 
Root beer shake: comes with a glass filled with vanilla ice cream and beer on the side. Best combo ever.

It's a must go place if you really don't know what to eat...lol"}
{"text":"Management did reach out to me a few weeks later. They apologized for my experience and offered to fix the problem.   I have been back to this location twice since the incident,  due to the fact that my office is close for lunch,  and the food is always very good. I know it's really hard to find decent help, especially in this industry. These employees have to realize every interaction with a diner, is a reflection not just of them but the whole establishment. Keep up the good work Zin Berger, and keep making great food."}
{"text":"I have promised myself that every time I visit Arizona, I must eat at Zinburger before leaving back home. For once, a burger joint understands that the mass of the meat should be more prominent than the mass of the bun! You don't have to go fishing for it. I usually get a special made sandwich with rye bread, beef patty, pastrami, coleslaw and other goodies inside. That sandwich and their truffle fries complete my trip every stinkin' time. If only there was one in California!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, good service.
The best time to go is when FRC offers their awesome 25% off. Expect a crowd, but there are usually seats at the bar. The stools are backless, but comfortable.
I usually get the Kobe burger  ($15) and Truffle fries ($6, and it's not a huge portion, nor bottomless). If I wanted a  normal burger, I'd go somewhere about $10 cheaper. But it's an experience. I think it fits in BFP just fine. I've also tried the turkey burger, and it was tasty, but I have no other restaurant to compare it to.
The decor is funny. Very cow friendly. At least it's not a bunch of red and white with peanut shells on the floor...

If I ever make it to happy hour, I may add the 4th star. Even though I get it, I'm just not that inclined to pay $21 + tax & tip for a burger and fries on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The best burgers we've ever had.  Been here twice now and we are bringing friends.  Fries good."}
{"text":"This place will be four or five star worthy soon, but they need to get the kinks worked out.  We ordered green chile fries first.  The order we received had clearly been sitting out.  We received them not two minutes after ordering them, but they were already quite cold.  I was pretty hungry so I did not let that deter me, but it was worth mentioning.  The burgers were very good, maybe a hair overcooked but closer to order than most places manage.  The service was quite poor, however.  We had a to-go order that we placed when our server first checked on us after receiving our food.  The order came out fairly quickly but was incomplete as our server forgot to order some of it.  By the time she returned with the check the burger was already pretty cold, so we did not push it.  However it took another twenty minutes or so for her to come back with the charge slip.  Give it a few more weeks and I think this place will be good, they just are not quite there yet."}
{"text":"Friday night and with all the other new restaurants and the food trucks the line was not long! Great waiter came up with diet coke for my wife even though they are a Pepsi place.   Who does that?   Food great as always."}
{"text":"Amazing hamburgers. Totally filling and memorable. Fries are good, milkshakes are good, not special though. Would skip both of these as they're overpriced. Burgers are worth their cost easily."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 but we can round up for the delicious drinks and a shorter wait time than the rest of downtown Gilbert! Each of the opportunities I have had to dine at Zinburger the wait time was 10-15 mins. This has always been significantly shorter than the 1hour+ wait times at other various downtown Gilbert joints. 

The drinks I have had the pleasure of sampling at Zin are the kind that you could keep going back for seconds... or perhaps, thirds... maybe, fours... oh dear... and not even realize how smashed you are getting because they are just so tasty you would like another and another...  

Their veggie burger is solid. Not my all time favorite. The patty has a good flavor but it tends to break apart more than I prefer for a veggie burger but that is one of the more difficult issues to fix. It nice that they have that option available for people that don't eat meat or beef. 

The fries and shakes are definitely where Zinburger shines. You can't go wrong with any of the fries options -- loaded, green chili, double truffle. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. Oh, and, their shakes mean business! They are rich, thick and decadent. I tried the Banana Royale and it was a banana split in a glass - whip cream and cherry on top included!! 

FYI: You can get the shakes to go (in case you were wondering). 

This location also serves brunch on Saturdays and Sunday from 10:00am-1:00pm. I highly recommend checking it out by grabbing a breakfast menu bloody mary on the patio in some nice weather."}
{"text":"The burger i ordered was extremely delicious. Very tender, great flavor, and the bun was great too. The dining experience in general however was poor, unorganized, and soooooo slooooowwwww. The servers didn't know who was handling our table, we had to wait for literally 30 minutes before we got our burgers, then when were done, we waited another long while before the had the check, and even longer before they returned it for us to sign, then they didn't leave a pen.

Overall, i'd rather order a burger to go."}
{"text":"I've loved this place since the day I moved to the Biltmore area!  The staff is so friendly and always wants to chat and not just serve you but make your experience fun!  

The food is unreal. It might be a burger joint but the buffalo chicken sandwich is no joke. I love it and it's a must try along with the truffle fries. Yes I said truffle. 

I love sitting at the bar and just having a beer as well. You don't always have to eat here so think of it as a great hang out spot as well!"}
{"text":"After being told to check this place out a dozen times - we went and it was great....really really great.. We sat at the bar - the fries - burgers - service - all top notch.  We are big fans.. if you have never been - you need to go - you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is crazy good! The food is quality and the service is great. You can't go wrong at this place if you are craving an amazing burger!!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Wife and I split the Blanco burger and an order of the spicy green chili fries. All really good and cooked to order.  Beer selection was great with some local favs. Will go back and try dessert.  Not sure I'm ready to go great.   It was all very good.  Open air building will be really cool as patio season heats up. You could do a lot worse, but the pricing seems a bit premium for the fare.  It is burgers and beer, right?"}
{"text":"I am a burger fanatic and have been wanting to try Zinburger for a while. As soon as we got seated, our server informed us that they use fresh meat and grind it every day to make their burgers. You can also choose Kobe instead for additional $5. 

I ordered the original Zinburger and the meat is definitely high quality, juicy and flavorful. I also ordered a side of the truffle fries. My husband ordered the Buffalo Chicken Burger, which was good but nothing too special. 

I would say that Zinburger wasn't anything out of the norm and is a bit pricey for the burger. However, the atmosphere is fun for group settings and they have great beer and yummy shakes."}
{"text":"It all started with expectation. I had never been to a Zinburger, so I had to order what they are named for. In anticipation I waited, only to be served a burger; just like any other burger. I pictured this wine flavored burger that was going to rock my world! It was an average burger. I must of misunderstood and thought that this was a signature dish. 

The atmosphere and scenery were good. Being located in the Biltmore Plaza shopping location gives you great options for movies, coffee or a great stroll around local merchants. I'll be back. The vibe was good and the place was crowded. So, I must have misfired on this one.

{"text":"Zinburger is a Fox Concept restaurant and they do a good job! This location in particular is my favorite. I'm a patio guy and will always choose to sit on the patio weather permitting. The patio here is just a great perch where you can take in all of your surroundings.

It is a blast to watch all of these older men cruising their high end rides \"Bentley, Beamers, Ferrari, Lambo's\" and trying to show off. It kills me... They must be trying to make up for something or have an ego the size of Texas. It is great to watch them pace around while they talk on their phone like they are the most important person on the planet. Look at me! I'm pacing and I have a nice ride! (Dweebs!).

Anyway, I had the Wedge salad and it was excellent. All of the components were awesome and the Ranch Dressing used really pulled it all together. I had a wedge the other day at the Vig at McDowell Mountain Ranch and it was both difficult to eat and $4 more than this one. I would pick this one any day of the week. 

My server rocked and though I was many steps away and they were busy, she took the time to venture out often and make sure that I was well taken care of. Thank you! I forgot your name but you did an awesome job. The menu as a whole is really good and I posted a picture of it on Rebel Food and Wine on Facebook.

The whole menu offers many favorites and the area is for sure kid friendly. There is even a water feature for them to run around and play in. As I stated earlier, I just like the people watching from Susie Spendalot to the groups of Scottsdale's finest plastic surgery built consortium, it is a blast to eat and take it all in. Oh, don't forget the Old Dude that needs the stick removed from his....

{"text":"First time to Zinburger!! And it was an awesome experience!! David was our server and He gave us incredible service Food was so Good!! Burgers are on point and are some the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the manager did offer to re-do our burger & did come around & ask us how we were doing twice. So on that note... I ordered the loaded fries. Apparently loaded means no flavor bland cheese sauce & fries with some bacon sprinkled on top. Blah! Luckily I ordered ketchup on the side to go with my burger I was waiting for & used some on my \"loaded fries\". A little flavor goes a long way guys, even something as simple as salt. Next on to my burger. I ordered it medium. To me & the nice waitress taking my order medium meant nice pink middle. My burger was raw on the inside. Raw! The only thing cooked was the outside. Thankfully I shared it with my husband & only had to pay for one raw burger. It's a burger place, why is my burger raw?!?!! You have burger in your name. For a place that makes burgers the number one thing on their menu the burger should be cooked perfect every time. Just like If I went to a steakhouse. And again a bit of flavor goes a long way. Salt isn't a bad thing in moderation! So disappointed."}
{"text":"Anybody who gives this place less than 5 stars is crazy! They never disappoint here. Every visit is just as good as the last if not better.  I will love zinburger for life!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Try the Brooklyn burger. Mouth watering.  The meat was so fresh and juicy.  The salted caramel shake was pretty good too.

Hand cut fries are okay."}
{"text":"Food is always good, I love all the fc restaurants. Have to try the sweet potato frys they are to die for and include a dip with them that is way better than ketchup"}
{"text":"Big, juicy, burgers...Sam Fox Style. The burgers here are juicy and delicious. The fries are just as good and very salty (in a good way). I especially enjoy the multiple dipping sauces they offer to accompany the fries and I always try to save room for a milkshake to wash it down! This is a good spot for lunch because the service is relatively quick!"}
{"text":"The turkey burger was delicious and so filling. It came with avocado, tomato, and great flavor. The fries were fresh cut and so good. The prickly pear drink was so good. The service was great. Would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"this place is so good. their fries are perfect and their burgers are cooked just the way you want it to be. they have so many options and they're all to die for. I try a new one each time I go!!"}
{"text":"Just opened.  Outdoor seating is Awesome here.  Food is pretty good.  Close at 10 on Friday nights though. Crush they were open later."}
{"text":"Every time I have entered this establishment, I am a bit dusty and untidy in my appearance. (Hiking the peak nearby manages to make me look less than serene). On my last visit,  I see sidelong glances my way from patrons who look casually elegant, as I ask for a table for 2 for where ever and when ever available.  There was a wait for the warm interior; but lucky for me,  the patio had no wait, as the temperature outside was very cold.  I was nice and comfy with the patio heater and my sweats.  This is a casual place, but my dusty hiking clothing may be too casual for some of the patrons, so sitting outside was nice.

As for the burgers, well, I have not had one I did not like.  The last burger I ordered was The Ringer - Applewood Smoked Bacon, Frank's Red Hot Onion Rings, Pepperjack Cheese & Mayo.  We substituted the mayo with avocado, then asked for it to be cooked medium.  It was perfectly cooked with a nice pink middle.  MmMmMm

Of course we had to order a side of truffle fries.  Luckily one portion is good enough to share.  I like dipping them in their chipotle mayo.

My server was upbeat and friendly.  However, She did forget to deliver 2 place settings.  Before I can make her aware of the problem, she was gone.  I just shrugged it off and dove right into the food.  Who needs the extra set of silverware in a burger place, and heck even the napkin when you are too busy stuffing your face?  I did need a knife to spread my chipotle mayo evenly on my bun, but I fixed that by using some fries.

I will be back to try the breakfast burger.  But since I consider this a good reward after hiking,  I will be back in my dusty hiking boots!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for work and found this little fem by chance. I was with my meat eating boss who really wanted a burger, however I'm vegan, which is usually quite a challenge. Zinburger has a delicious Veg burger that I had prepared as the California Bowl after they graciously informed me the buns are not Vegan. It was so delicious I went back 2 days later and got it again! I also was able to try the sweet potato fries. They were good, not great. I had a drink, cannot recall the name, some lemon with muddled blackberries and vodka...absolutely delicious!! Great laid back diner feel with creative chef flavors!!!"}
{"text":"The hostesses were quite rude and acted a bit to good for their job, the server was great but I found a hair on my plate. Definitely going to give it a second try. They took great care of me. I recommend the breakfast burger!"}
{"text":"I was here for the Private Event they held before the Grand Opening. Service was spot-on. For drinks we got the Pomegranate Ginger Mule (not bad, worth a try) and my GF got the Raspberry Acai Margarita (she liked it, so I guess try it). For starters we had Truffle Fries (#amazefries). For the entrée we got the ZinBurger and the Kobe Burger (both where really good). Overall, it was an excellent experience and we will definitely be coming back. This is going to be one of my go to cheat day spots."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Fox restaurants and I do really like the food at this one. One need only see some of my other reviews of Fox properties. 
The only reason I am giving this place only 2 stars is because of my experience last night. 
Three of us had dinner there. We all had burgers and shared some sides. Like all specialty burger joints, the burgers are 9-15 bucks and sides are ordered separately. This means it can get a little pricey if all you really want is a great burger and fries. Alone, I would have just gone to The Habit. 
Suffice it to say that all of our food was great. Hot, fresh, timely. What put us off was that practically the whole time we were eating, there was a server sweeping under all of the vacant tables around us as well as using her phone flashlight to inspect under the heavy round table bases. God knows WHAT she was looking for?! Roaches? Mice? Errant pickles? I had a similar experience at their flagship store The Henry, one of the many things that earned that Fox place a single star in a review by me. It didn't matter, it was off putting. In fact it may have even been in violation of the health code. When I was in the business in Canada, it was against Food Safe guidelines to sweep any dining area while people are still eating. Why? Because sweeping stirs up dirt into the air which then settles peacefully into your cheeseburger and onion rings, with the remainder settling into your ice tea. This is a huge no no, and it seems Fox employees are always in such a darned hurry to finish their side duties while dinner is still being served. This is so gauche and disgusting I'm surprised their management staff doesn't put a stop to this happening. Perhaps they are rushing the staff out the door to save the $3.00 an hour a server earns in wages?
In any case, Fox restaurants needs to re-visit closing duties etiquette, and have the janitorial work be completed once ALL of the diners have paid and left. 
I likely won't bother going back to Zin Burger. Delux Burger has better food, is just as close to our house and I have never once been annoyed by a sweeping server while enjoying their delish nosh. Sorry Zin, we're breaking up. It's not me, it's you."}
{"text":"I loved Zinburger! I had a Turkey Sloppy Joe and my table shared the truffle fries! Everything was so good and I plan to go back!"}
{"text":"I like Zinburger, do I think it is a bit pricey (burgers do not come with fries... SAY WHAT?!?!?) yes. However, it is always enjoyable and I like the laid-back atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are really good,  I've tried them all and they are creative,  tasty and fresh.  Recommend the salty caramel shake."}
{"text":"we met some friends here last night. knowing this was a fox restaurant ensured that we were going to have great food and great service. luckily, they had already gotten a table because when we arrived, we heard there was an hour wait!

the dining area is typical of fox...clean lines, open kitchen. and of his staff...extraordinarily friendly and helpful. 

they offered a few meatless selections, including a veggie burger and some great salads. i opted for a napa salad with almonds and ahi tuna. it took forever to come out, but when it did, it was super flavorful and tasty. add to that a side of sweet potato fries which tasted like sweet potatoes and not salt! what a wonderful concept!

with such a large group, there was bound to be confusion come bill time. it took about 30 minutes for the group to figure out what to do, and all the while, our server never missed a beat and did whatever was helpful to the group. luckily, we paid on our own so we didn't have an issue, but she deserved a great tip. 

water glasses filled constantly. reasonable prices and another great experience at the fox enterprise."}
{"text":"I have to say that this was easily one of the best burgers I have ever had! I paid the extra $5 to upgrade to a Kobe beef patty it was totally worth it. We had to wait 40 minutes for a table and I would do it all over again! We were able to snag a couple bar seats and have cocktails while we waited. If you want a burger, get yourself to Zinburger!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Zinburger. I made a mistake on OpenTable and made the reservation at the Zinburger Gilbert. We were a party of seven on a very busy Saturday night. The hostess took care of us and got a seated in about a half an hour. It was greatly appreciated! The food was great. My favorite is the grass fed burger. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Food was good, staff was helpful and I loved all the open window when a wonderful breeze would come in. It was quite crowded and the wait was longer than I hoped for but it was lunch time."}
{"text":"Overpriced food, apathetic service, night club-esque (aka very loud) music, and cracked drinking glasses.

We ordered the Bruce Lee Burger, Blanco Burger, Zucchini Fries, Green Chili Fries, and a kid's meal with chicken strips and French fries. Our waitress was slow on refills and never to be seen again after she dropped off our food. If she had taken the time to ask how our meal was, I would've informed her the guacamole on the Blanco Burger tasted rotten, rendering the burger inedible, and my daughter's chicken strips were practically black due to extreme over  frying (making them pretty gross too). As it is, she expressed no interest in our food or satisfaction, even when she brought us the check and noticed us leaving with practically full plates.

The French fries and zucchini fries were good and the only thing separating this review from a single star.

Yet another Downtown Gilbert Restaurant not worth your money with its $10-$13 mediocre burgers and a $5-$7 surcharge for fries."}
{"text":"The reason I am writing this review is simply to let everyone know how amazing these burgers are! I rarely order a burger because it is one dish I am very picky about, but these are exceptional. Cooked perfectly to order with a fantastic selection. Zinburger also has an awesome atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Good food, not great but good.  Service was really good. And the atmosphere is pretty cool.  Kind of pricey for a burger that does not come with a side. Burgers run about $12, and a side of fries is $5."}
{"text":"We all know that one star really means zero stars. If you want to pay $13 for a burger with service so bad your drink is empty the entire 40 minutes you are there, Zinburger is your place. Their kids meal options are a complete joke. I ordered chicken fingers and received rock-hard, greasy, deep-fried dry pieces of chicken. I'm going to pay $6 for that? They couldn't offer grilled chicken with a side of... oh, I don't know, veggies? What is this, McDonald's? Oh wait, even they offer fruit slices- my mistake. With all of the competition nearby, I'm surprised they're still open. The quality of food is terrible and the service is even worse. Don't even think about asking one of the girls to turn on a heater (the only one that isn't on) unless you want to hear an audible \"ugh.\" This place is an overall mess. Stay away. You're far better off going to pretty much anywhere on that strip of Gilbert."}
{"text":"Food was good, but expected it to be being a FOX restaurant and they try hard.  I felt profiled.  I guess I didn't look the part to eat a burger at the bar.  Sorry, but I was working all day in my yard getting ready for a party at my home tomorrow and had the taste for a turkey burger.  We live right off of Camelback actually just west of Fashion Square Mall, but Old Town was packed so our son mentioned about Zin Burger.  I thought cool-I know I will get a decent burger there...

Service stunk!  The bartender had no interest in us.  So sad.  I even tried to make conversation with him.  He kept calling me MAM.  UGH!  I was feeling ignored and looked down on so I found myself insecure to a point where I literally tried to start small talk about the other Fox restaurants I have tried out...new to the area...from Chicago...we ask him suggestions and he seems annoyed...we are spoiled living in Chicago, I in the industry, living to experiencing different dining ventures all over the world...and this guy did not even know to bring us a plate each or even silverware for our appetizer that we were sharing!!!  We had to eat it cold because we couldn't even find him to get the plates!  

Oh, and then our food was taken from us without even asking us before we were even done with the sauces on the plates!  

Well, it is what it is.  Shame on him.  He couldn't even bring us an itemized bill and expected us to just assume we had the right bill amount.  I even questioned it and he literally shrugged his shoulders!!!

Talk about being \"dissed\"!  

Please, do not ever treat anyone else like that ever again.  I do not really care what you think of me by my appearance, it just saddens me to know that this bartender's attitude is so aloof and with lack of empathy."}
{"text":"My boss kept telling me to try this place so we did! We waited at the bar and everyone was friendly. We ordered the cheese fries which were wonderful. I had the craft your own burger and it was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy. My friend had the Kobe burger which was really good and perfectly cooked! The milkshakes are $5 and YUMMY! The burgers are a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, I dislike the wait for a table game. Arrive for lunch and was told there was a 40-45 minute wait while 5 tables are empty."}
{"text":"Always love this place when I'm in the mood for a burger! They have so many different combinations I'm sure anyone can find one they love! They also offer chicken  sandwiches too! My favorite are their spicy ones , but I loooove spicy food! They have these fries that are spicy too that are bomb! Can't go there without ordering them! I usually get my burger protein style (lettuce instead of bun) it can get a little messy, but I can't finish my burgers when I get bread! The customer service is always awesome and our servers are always sweet and friendly! Love their work attire, casual cute, and very modern! Haven't really had the drinks here, usually I'll come for dinner and drinks after since there's so much around in the area. Definitely a hit for meat lovers!:)"}
{"text":"A birthday party and we brought to babies! they sure were patient and accomodating. food was great and I really enjoyed the zucchini fries as well as the sauce that came with sweet potato fries. burger was huge! wish the egg wasn't cooked so thoroughly on my breakfast burger, i like the yolk to drip into the burger and make a huge mess. but overall loved it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The hamburgers are amazing and everything else. I really like the samburger! 
(I think that's what it's called)"}
{"text":"A trendy burger shop in the Biltmore mall. Although the burgers are obviously quality burgers, and they offer an extensive menu of different burgers, it was also probably the most expensive burger I've had. The service is also on the slower side."}
{"text":"The food is good and the location is fine. Just a few little things are always wrong. If I order a burger with no bun and not lettuce wrapped, please don't give me lettuce. Also a burger with a fried egg on it should never have a skewer jammed in it. Thanks for breaking my egg every time. 

In the summer there are also kids and families streaming through the space and bumping into tables to get to the restroom from the nearby splash pad. The restaurant shouldn't allow non-customers to use the restroom since the location isn't that large and a parade of kids in bathing suits don't really add to the dining experience. 

Overall, Zinburger is a typical Fox Restaurant. The food is good, the prices are fine and the location is nice. This particular location just leaves a few things to be desired."}
{"text":"first off..I rarely eat red meat so when I do it better be good.  My husband took me to Zinburger last week for my first time and I am definitely a fan.  The bun was perfect, the Kobe burger cooked perfectly and very tasty..and don't forget the zucchini fries that I wished I didn't have to split with my husband.  The atmosphere kind of reminds me of an upscale employee cafeteria, but the bar area/patio was good for people watching.  I will def go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service.  This is important to me when going out to eat.  Food was perfectly prepared.  One minor mistake and the burger and deserts were comped.  This is a place that cares about their customers and wants them to return.  I am a satisfied customer and will totally come back."}
{"text":"Good burgers and good Bloody Mary's with bacon.  Everything is better with bacon, even the vodka was infused with bacon fat."}
{"text":"Decent burgers and beer list. Do try to sit outside. The noise inside was painful. Better to have the Gilbert Rd traffic. It wasn't background music but cover up the conversation music."}
{"text":"Zinburger is one of the many new restaurant to come to downtown Gilbert area. I like that the restaurant is open with a nice outdoor patio and bar area. Very spacious and roomy. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar today and the weather was perfect. The service was fast and our server was nice. I ordered the zinburger and my boyfriend ordered the samburger and we got a side order of the truffle French fries. Both burgers tasted fresh and juicy but it's not the best I've had.  The only thing I didn't like about the burgers was that the meat was so juicy that it made the bread soggy. It was kind of messy to eat and hard to pick up. The truffle fries were crispy and good but I didn't think they were amazing like the reviews I read."}
{"text":"Just ate myself into a food coma. Usually I do not go this overboard! 

The hostesses and server were great. We were seated quickly, had our order taken, and received our food, all in a timely matter.

We started out with the hand cut french fries, sweet potato fries, and a Butterfinger milkshake split four ways. I usually do not get things like milkshakes, but 1/4 of one shake was plenty for me! The fries and shake were absolutely delicious.

For my dinner I got the veggie burger. It was messy but very tasty. The bun was not quite as good as it looked, but I still liked it. I also really liked that it had avocado on it, yum!

Would love to come back here and give those truffle fries or zucchini fries a try! That Nutella shake looked fantastic also."}
{"text":"The different takes on how they create an angus burger is really cool. The classic zinburger and the blanco burger were great, and when prepared medium with all the toppings it tasted awesome. The loaded fries went great with burgers. The banana cream pie was huge and surprisingly wasnt too sweet."}
{"text":"The vegetable fries are okay.  Could have used more time in the fryer.  Of all of the fox concepts, this one seemed to have been an afterthought.  The mural inside is cheeky, reminding one that you are indeed eating a cow.  But the milkshakes are really good as are the desserts, its just that when you are going for a burger, you really really want a good burger.  The burgers are just okay.  The only good one is the kobe burger, the rest taste about the same as you can get at Cheesecake factory.  The uniformed servers look and act like they were culled from a fresh training group.  They are trying though!  If you have a burger hankering, you're better off heading to Delux or Smashburger."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Fox concepts, so we gave Zinburger multiple tries before deciding it just wasnt going to be the love affair I had hoped. Our first visit, we waited a long time for our food. When it did make it to our table my salad order was wrong and the burger tasted good but the bun was so soggy I just skipped it. The service was good though so we tried again. 
The second time was with a group of 10, we called ahead and were told that they don't take reservations on weekends out of consideration for their walk in guests. We were told the wait was an hour so some of us arrived early to put our names in. When we arrived, we were quoted 2 hours. After about an hour there were multiple empty tables including a large table that was sitting empty for 20 minutes. We let the host know again that we were willing to split up. She informed us that the large table sitting empty was for a reservation. So they do take reservations. By the time we put in our orders I had to ask for my food to go because it was over 3 hours before we even got our food. She brought my box then disappeared. It took another 10 minutes before I could find someone to get me a check so I could leave.
There are better options in Downtown Gilbert if we feel like braving the weekend crowds again."}
{"text":"Good happy hour. Get your burger medium well otherwise it will be too greasy. Which is not necessarily a bad thing! The buns they use are really tasty too. Make sure to get some fries.  All of them are very good, my favorite are the truffle fries. And banana cream pie is very good, and I usually don't pick banana as my favorite in desserts. But get there early, they run out of seating very fast! I like to sit out at the patio, there's a fire pit out there or misters. Also is quite on the patio. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing ! The service not as much. The hostesses are not very friendly. Waitstaff is a bit better but still not the friendliest. Their fries are amazing and so are their burgers. Will definitely go back !"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had in a long time.  Perfectly cooked, great quality meat, and great friendly service. We both had the EL DIABLO burger (Fire Roasted Jalapeños, Pepper Jack Cheese, Braised Onions, Lettuce & Chipotle Mayo).  Just a little more heat and it would have been perfect!  Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a great burger."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends. I have tried the one in Gilbert but since we were around the area we decide to visit this location. The service was good, even if they were busy. I ordered the turkey burger which was awesome!! Not greasy at all, very fresh, and juicy! We also had sweet potato fries, which we can never go wrong with and tried their loaded fries. I would recommend their loaded fries. It has cheese, bacon, and sour cream on top. Their fries is not greasy at all! Great place to meet up with friends and family."}
{"text":"Nice place but save your money  - don't get the Kobe burger. Not worth an extra five bucks - - Fuddruckers is just as good a burger for half the price."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and chicken sandwiches are served here. Jalapeño burgers are delicious!  Good service and Great drinks!! Cool vibes.  Their fries were yummy and loaded with goodness!"}
{"text":"Great burger and the double truffle fries are stellar as well. Stopped in right before closing time and still got a full menu and weren't rushed out."}
{"text":"Service was really good and the food was delicious. Love the vibes here. Recommend would come again"}
{"text":"So many better options nearby. Living close by, we've given this place a few tries to get it right...this last time there was a clear push pin in my water. No biggie, not cool, but it happens. However, the way the manager handled the situation made me finally write this review. We didn't ask for the manager, just a new glass sans push pin and the manager came to our table about 10 minutes later with a new glass and said, \"wow, we don't have those kinds of pins here. Weird. Here's a new water\". And walked away. That was that. It felt strange. She didn't introduce herself as the manager, the only way we knew was because the server returned to our table and asked if the manager had brought the new water. Just blah service to match the blah food."}
{"text":"Really, really fantastic burgers right here!
I'm a Ringer/Diablo girl, my mom dreams about the Grass-fed with tomato and my son... Well, when I asked him if he liked the kid's burger he said \"uh-UH!\" with his mouth full. Then when I asked him if he liked it better than my burgers, he gave me a guilty look and refused to answer. Sad mommy face :(

Room for improvement: The servers are all very nice, but occasionally I've felt a bit forgotten. The zucchini fries could use a little more seasoning. 

It's especially nice when you find a local spot the whole family can agree on!"}
{"text":"You are what you eat and this cow ate well. :) (I was referring to the actual moo-cow that is - haha!)  Burgers & wine, some beer and some fries; have a toast with milkshakes and some zucchini breaded and fried - yum!  Zucchini in the fryer?  Why not it tastes just as good as some yam fries.  The ambience was chill, but I can do without the pictures on the walls.  I don't want my farmer to wear any sort of bio-suit - I want him or her in overalls or if she's, hot dazy dukes :)  Service was good, I always enjoy my server able to take a joke or two and come back with some :)  - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a long day of moving our daughter into GCU and shopping for her dorm room. We were looking for a salad and decided to try Zinburger. SO glad we did. My wife had the Asian chicken salad which was done very nicely. I had the Bruce Lee burger. Great mix of flavors and cooked perfect medium. Had the mixed green salad as a side. Really nice mix of flavors of greens, corn, feta, tomato and vinaigrette dressing. Our servers were friendly. Next time we're back in Phoenix, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the complaints are about. The staff was exceptionally kind during my visit. I think just about every person working came up to me at some point during my meal and asked if everything was okay or if I needed anything. Service-wise, they rank very high.

I ordered their truffle fries. Those were spectacular. It's not often you go to a restaurant and rave about the fries, but these fries deserve an applause, as does the sauce that comes with them. Oh, and I also got the Plain and Simple burger. This was good, and it was simple (mustard, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato), but sometimes simple works just fine. 

Good Happy Hour, friendly staff, good experience."}
{"text":"One sunny afternoon I needed to refuel during my shopping trip to Scottsdale Quarter. I walk by Zinburger all the time and decided to give it a try. I have been to the location at the Biltmore but only once a few years ago. I sat at the bar and looked over their menu. I have to point out that the menu is almost exclusively burgers, they have a few basic salads but this is not a place for the vegetarian in your friend group. 

I love a little spice so I ordered the El Diablo Burger. The patties are giant and the fire roasted jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, and chipotle mayo were like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I didn't think the burger was too spicy but it definitely had some heat. Because I have little to no self control I got a side of double truffle fries with aioli and I couldn't get enough! The portions ensured I had some of everything left over for lunch at work the next day, but of course I ate it later that night (remember the lack of self control I mentioned?). 

Next time I am craving a big juicy burger this will be my spot!"}
{"text":"I went here last night on a random whim, I have stalked Mojo yogurt (next door) for several weeks now (going at least 1x a week). I always passed by Zinburger but didn't think to go there for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised that the prices weren't too pricey, and the food was really great.

We ordered the Snickers shake to split, amazing! I think it may be only for the summer so hurry in and get one because it was delish! Truffle fries with dipping sauce were really great to share.

I got the turkey burger (next time no mayo) and traded the swiss for pepper jack. My friend got the Kobe burger, said it was fantastic. Service was good, fast turn around on the food/shake.

Overall good meal, and I will return!"}
{"text":"Was nervous coming here, one of the inky fox restaurants I had not tried and I hadn't heard anything about it, but wow was it good.  I had the boy blue burger and I love when I can go somewhere and get a burger that I don't normally see on a menu, and it's good! The may tag blue cheese was creamy and the burger was cooked perfectly, nice and juicy, it was a little messy but sometimes the best foods are! 

Also, for not accepting reservations they were able to get us in quick at 6 o clock on a Friday night, unheard of for the downtown Gilbert area.  Our waiter was great and the hostesses were awesome, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my boyfriends burger was a little under seasoned- but all in all a great burger joint with great drinks and a cool inviting area."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Outstanding food & great staff!!!! If you haven't been yet, your missing out!!"}
{"text":"With the Fox gift card in hand (bought from Costco with its $100 value and paid $80) my daughter and I decided to visit Zinburger for happy hour.     I must admit, I'm not a bread fan, but after checking out their menu online, my eyeballs zeroed in on their loaded fries.   Are you kidding??   Fries, bacon in a cheese sauce topped with sour cream?   Who can resist!   Not this person.   

She ordered the el diablo burger and I ordered the Bruce Lee burger.   (See photos)   Whoa!!   My burger was piled high with the bun, avocado, jalapenos, coleslaw, cucumber and, of course, the sauce.   No way anyone could wrap one's mouth around that, that's for sure.   Definitely pull out the fork and knife.  

The fries came piled high with plenty of bacon in its light cheese sauce drizzled with the sour cream.  YUMMMM!!   It was a can't-eat-just-one-fry dish.   Whatever part of the fries weren't already dipped in the sauce was dipped and topped with its accompanying bacon.

I tried part of my burger (since no way could I eat much else after the fries) and the burger was perfect.  Fat and juicy grilled patty with the sriracha mayo and I guess rice wine vinaigrette.   They must have mixed the two together since it wasn't runny.  The added jalapeno was a good touch since I do tend to like hot and spicy.  The bun was toasted and I assume buttered, which makes it all the more appealing. Saved the avocado for later.

I think my daughter liked her burger.   She had been to Zinburger a few times prior, and it was her suggestion to visit the restaurant.

I would definitely return.   My tip is to get there during happy hour to take advantage of their pricing of beers and wine and the sides and especially if you don't want to wait.   I think the only burger on HH is the one with lettuce and tomato.   How boring is that."}
{"text":"The wait was horrible tonight... we were told 20-25 minutes and it took 50+. Very frustrating. The food also took a long time but was good. Not going to drop by here any time soon. This was definitely not a normal Fox Concepts experience"}
{"text":"I am a huge critic of hamburgers and Zinburger has been my absolute favorite hamburger spot since the day that it opened. Everything about this place makes me happy, the double truffle fries are amazing, they're shakes are inexpensive and divine (cookies and creme is my go to) and every aspect of the burger is delicious. The buns are soft never dry, I love that they use shredded lettuce instead of leaf lettuce so I can actually taste my burger, and I love the option of being able to build my own burger. My biggest critique of burgers is how they are prepared. If I ask for medium rare, I really don't want to eat anything but medium rare. I've gone to other zinburger restaurants and have been burned a few times with my burgers coming out well done but this location has it down, perfect ever single time. I seriously appreciate it!!

Best time to go is Monday-Friday from 4-6 pm for happy hour!! Half of sides and fries, $7 Plain and Simple burger which I always get and then pile on the toppings, and drink specials. 

I have tried to branch out in the burger department and have found some close alternatives but Zinburger, in my opinion, is the best burger place!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars is more accurate....just can't give it 3.

Stopped in with my wife and daughter for lunch and sadly left unimpressed. Service.....good. Setting......good. Food and price......not so much. I ordered the Kobe Burger and a side of fries and was really looking forward to great flavor. I mean if a brother is going to drop $15 on burger and $5 on fries, I am expecting above average. Upon arrival, visually both looked tasty. The meat was very juicy and was impressed. The rest, not so much. Where is the flavor? Where is the salt? Neither existed here. I should not have to salt my own grub when dropping $20 bucks for burger and fries. 

My wife ordered the Chinese chicken salad. She thought it tasted okay but again, thought it just did not taste great or even good. My daughter ordered the kids cheeseburger, which came with fries. At $3, this was a great value for what she got. If only I would have dropped her off and my wife and I ate elsewhere.  She thought her meal was great. Kind of sums it up if you ask me. The place hits the flavor palate of a child. 

We did try the vanilla malt and it was tasty. For $5, I would probably order again but doubt this guy will be back.  

In closing, $50 for a family of three here for lunch is a joke when it comes to taste. I have no problem spending that for burgers and fries but know that your customers demand more when they are spending more. I would not recommend and will continue to send my yelpers to Paradise Valley Burger Co."}
{"text":"So obviously this place pulls in major business and is rather well regarded by its regulars. I decided to give it a shot, as I am relatively new in Phoenix. I came here with several friends, and we were seated promptly. The waitress was very sweet and attentive...I appreciated her effort in providing quality service.

We ordered sweet fries, onion rings, and truffle fries, to share between 5 people. They were promptly finished. The sweet fries were paired with a tzatziki sauce, which I found to be a rather poor pairing. The fries themselves were decent but nothing special. The onion rings were pretty tasty-- the barbecue sauce they came with was nothing extraordinary. The truffle fries were my favorite, but  the aioli they came with was too rich and not tangy enough. I ordered the blackberry lemonade but i found it to be a bit too sugary.

Our burgers came out within decent time. I decided to go with the Kobe burger. It was definitely excellent-- cooked just right and dripping with juicy goodness. No doubt the quality of the beef likely attributed to the enjoyment. The potato bun was ever so crunchy and melted in my mouth at just the right moments. I'm a sucker for the main entree, so if its good, my review usually ends up as a good review. I left quite satisfied and wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while out shopping and decided to bring a friend back the following week.  The first time I ordered the West Coast Chicken.  Everything about it was tasty -- nice size chicken piece, the bun, havarti cheese, tomato, and avocado. I appreciated that the avocado slices were covered by the melted cheese, so didn't slip out whenever I took a bite. 

Zinburger is part of the Fox Concept group of local restaurants, and every one is a winner.  However, it is pricey.  Zinburger specializes in burgers and no sides come with it.  The $5-$7 sides are good-sized, and include loaded fires, green chili fries, and sweet potato fries (my favorite), as well as onion rings and mac-cheese.  There are also shakes and malts, a little costly for the size.  

But the burgers are worth the price.  The meat is so fresh, so noticeably different from run-of-the-mill burgers.  On the second visit, my friend liked the combination in the West Coast Chicken sandwich, but wanted a burger.  The server didn't hesitate to make that substitution. I ordered a small wedge salad and was slightly disappointed that it wasn't really a wedge, but served as a chopped salad.  But everything was good and my friend raved about her burger.

The seating area is open and energetic. The bar is fun because, when weather permits, one side is open to the outdoors, so seating is almost all around the bar. 

Zinburger is located in Gilbert's Heritage District, in an area with many good restaurants and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Second experience 
Below is my first review of this restaurant. After my first experience the owner reached out to me and gave me a gift card so I could try it again; which I thought was very generous offer on her part.
So, my husband, our son and I went their for lunch. It was a better experience this time. Both times the hamburgers were cooked spot on. We all ordered medium rare and they were cooked perfectly. Both times the buns were exceptionally fresh and toasted to perfection. Our son had a build your own burger. It was piled high with generous portions of the various toppings he selected. My husband had the breakfast burger. He was impressed this time with the flavor and the seasoning. I had the my boy blue burger. The blue cheese was wonderful and just the right amount. The A1 sauce gave it just enough kick, but not so much were it would overwhelmed the burger. We also shared the loaded fries. They two were flavorful and had generous portions of bacon and cheese sauce. We would definitely go to Zen burger again!

First experience:
Well...I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. But it just wasn't that good. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good. It looked beautiful. The bun was really good. It was cooked well. It just didn't have much flavor. I don't even think they put a dash of salt on the burger. And the fries sounded amazing in theory. I ordered the truffle Parmesan fries. But they were over cooked and also tasteless. Even with all of this said because I didn't hate it I could've overlooked a lot othe service was better."}
{"text":"Zinburger used to be a hit or miss.  So much that we stopped coming. About a year ago in Costco we saw a $100 for the price of $80 and decided to try it again. When we came we got suckered into their great holiday deal \" buy a $100 and get $20 bucks more\".  We have been coming at minimum once a month to this location and I swear it has to be the managers running it that has changed our opinion and yelp communities opinion to become a solid 4 Star business.  
These burgers start at 10 bucks and go up.  Fries are family style. $5-7. Shakes are thick and tasty $5-6. 
They have a choco cream pie that is out of this world good.  
We like it.  We will keep coming back especially as they keep the service and the food the way it should be at the price it's at. They are good burgers and as of now they are done perfectly."}
{"text":"I won't go here again. Staff is stellar! Food is a gross disappointment, so was the lemonade. The Zinburger in Gilbert is amazing so I was really let down when I took my brother out here when he flew into town :-("}
{"text":"This place has a chill vibe and pretty good burgers. Decently priced, good service, and 2 hours free parking. They had a gluten free bun which is clutch to be able to get a good gluten free burger. I had the samburger which was good and the farm salad to start which was packed with all the good stuff."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. I just wish I could bring this place with me to Saint Louis, because I'd be a weekly patron.

It's in the entertainment district area of Gilbert, and has the modern vibe. When the weather is nice, you can sit on the patio and look onto the street. It's great for people watching and enjoying a nice evening. The wait staff is average; nothing that wows you, but nothing bad either. They are pretty quick with the food, even during peak hours when this place is mobbed.

I had the breakfast burger. It's perfectly cooked medium, with a great over easy egg, bacon, mayo, and added avocado. The meat was excellent and juicy. The bun held up well to the large burger. Overall, one of the best, if not the best, burger I've ever had.

The fries are amazing as well. They are crispy, salted properly, and not too greasy or heavy."}
{"text":"Zinburger was one of my favorites but was very surprised to find that they have taken the ah tuna salad off the menu, it was the best in Phoenix.  I tried the new salmon salad and it was terrible.  A very small piece of overcooked salmon on lots of romain lettuce and not much else.  According to the menu it was supposed to have avocado.  Good luck finding the 3 or 4 very small pieces.  My friends had the new burger bowl which they said was very good.  Stick to the burgers, I will have to find another place for my salads, so sad as it was my favorite. Zinburger you can do better.
John"}
{"text":"DOH!!!!!! I so wanted this to be a great burger place for me, so sorry its not. Me and my wife went their for the first time this week as they opened. No crowds, first ones in. We both had the Angus beef Zin burger, $10.50 for JUST the burger. We also ordered for $5.00 one  order of Sweet Potato fries{ They were GREAT} The burgers were just \"OK\". tasted like plain meat, not seasoned at all. Comes with Manchego Cheese, Zinfandel Braised Onions, Lettuce & Mayo. and 4-pickel slices on the plate. The onions are so slippery, that the burger won't stay together, a mess. I really expected more. So I have to give Zinburger a big Doh!"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food and an extra star for the design and layout of the restaurant.

I ordered the Samburger and the fries which were satisfactory.  The bacon on the burger was nice and crisp.  I enjoyed two Sierra Nevada's on tap and what I appreciated was that they were served in  nice cold glasses.

Sitting at the bar facing out towards the patio was the perfect spot.  I could see the TV, enjoy the fresh air, watch people walking by, and easily order another beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Zinburger. I haven't tried a burger that I don't absolutely love. We love their truffle fries. SO GOOD. Any of the fries are a big enough portion to share between 2-3 people. 
Their milkshakes are good but no phenomenal. The only thing we don't care for a the wait times on the weekend."}
{"text":"Impeccable customer service... beyond impressed with this restaurant. Their generosity does not go unnoticed. Food is excellent--love the burgers, fries and the salads! And the shakes are delish! Thank you, I plan to be a regular customer for years to come!!"}
{"text":"A great burger/beer/wine place!

Found this gem since I work down the street.

Yummy burgers, excellent sweet potato and truffle fries. Burgers are a decent size.\

Only cons: Big open window/patio area allows flies to pester you when you are seated INSIDE. So annoying. You will be swatting flies in between bites.

Also, I wish they had a bigger wine and beer list.

Friendly service, clean place (minus the flies...)"}
{"text":"One of our go-to restaurants in DT Gilbert - best zucchini fries ever for sure!  

Great staff and the management takes care of kitchen mis-steps no questions asked. 

Have returned time and again and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Another great spot to come for happy hour. The waiters are very friendly and patient. If you can grab seating outside to so. Whatever you do not order the kale salad unless you are eating it with something else because as a meal it left ALOT to be desired. The salad I had was just kale with some salad dressing, that's it. But the zucchini fries were good so thank goodness for that. I will be back to try the burgers one day soon. Overall not bad at all."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday, I had the zinburger, but tried most of the other food ordered.  Everything was delicious.  I just wish the wait wasn't always 1-2 hours on the weekends, but I guess that's what happens when you make good food."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I love this burger joint! Ive tried their breakfast burger, the ringer (minus franks red hot), truffle fries, fried zucchini and their hazelnut milkshake- I think that was the name..

The breakfast burger I ordered medium rare, it was delicious, but only finished half, I ate it the day after and I swear it tasted even better!!

The Ringer, medium rare, was great, but I love my first choice more, although I did devour the whole thing! I also like ot without the hot sauce, I feel like it masks the natural yumminess to the burger.

Milkshake- super rich, creamy, chocolatey, yummy crunchy-ness, if you're a Fererro Rocher fan and/or nutella, this is YOUR GO TO MILKSHAKE! 

Double Truffle Fries- they definitely don't skim on the truffle, heavy truffle taste, but thats what i love, so if you're not a die hard truffle lover, this side might be too much for you! 

Staff seems friendly, both times I've gone, my servers have always left me with empty water glasses waiting to be filled, a pet peeve of mine, please be more attentive."}
{"text":"We are totally grossed out after eating at Zinburger today. First of all, while we waited outside for a table, a man stood right next to their fencing between Zinburger and Pomo and blew his cigarette smoke onto all the customers that were eating outside. Not a single employee at either restaurant said anything to him. After we were seated and ordered our food, another customer was seated alone outside. As soon as the hostess walked away, her male friend went into the patio area with a large dog. The dog jumped up onto the upholstered bench and then the girl's lap. The dog proceeded to sit at the table as customers inside watched and commented on how gross that was. As we waited for our lunch, we noted that every employee that walked passed this couple stopped to chat for quite some time. We're assuming the dog owner is also an employee because everyone seemed very friendly with her. Most of the employees also stopped to pet the dog, bring it water, feed it fries, etc. and then they would immediately serve food or fill water of other customers. One waitress (with her blonde hair in a knot, large black earrings, and a black and white headband) petted the dog on several occasions then brought food to customers, picked up a water pitcher and rubbed one hand all over the spout as she carried it, etc.  Next time I eat at Zinburger, I think I'll bring my pet ferret to run around the table and between customers' legs."}
{"text":"Milkshakes are the best thing there. Second best is the free covered parking. Third is the waitstaff & fourth is the interior decor / atmosphere. 

It is a bit pricey & the first time my husband ordered a burger the inside was more raw than he'd have liked."}
{"text":"I had such high expectations based on past visits - which candidly were quite some time ago - but the burger was overcooked, without taste and basically underwhelming.  Won't be back because there are too many good burger places elsewhere.  The milk shake was great but the fries weren't very good either so all in all it was a complete disappointment.  The server was nice but the service was slow which would have been okay had the food been great like in the past.  

Frankly, I heard another server ask the table behind ours how their food was and their response was \"uninspiring\".  They told him it was their first time and they were walking the mall and decided to try it.  I guess it was a bad day for Zin.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Our server Shae was amazing and on top of it!  The food was delish!  We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch study break, and it was so good that I totally forgot I was studying! Just keeding. Really though I when I ordered my breakfast burger I have to admit I was expecting the usual greasy/salty burger, but to my pleasant surprise it was cooked perfectly and not overly salty or greasy. Overall the burger had a very nice balance of meat to egg to cheese to bacon. What more can I hungry guy ask for? The truffle fries were very tasty as well and a good portion for 2 people to share. 
I will definitely be back here soon to try out the other tasty looking burgers. 
And also, for a Thursday at 11am, this place really filled up quickly...do people not have work??"}
{"text":"We live just minutes from downtown Gilbert and were looking for a new place to check out. My fiancé and I came on a Thursday evening around 6PM and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. A lot of large parties were there that night so the waiting area was really crowded and there was very limited seating to wait. We got our text saying a table was ready and were seated in a 4 top with a booth. 

Here are the things I really liked: The service was excellent- drinks were always refilled, we were asked several times how food was tasting and ended up staying a couple hours. Bartenders were great and the bar area is nice (and has all the TV's unless you sit outside on the patio). The food was really good- zucchini fries were hot and not overly battered. I got the breakfast burger and it was a party in my mouth! It came with a fried egg, cheese, bacon, lettuce and mayo- mmm good! The ice cream is also really good- we ended with a small vanilla shake. Oh and like other reviews have mentioned, the décor is modern and very nice! 

Things I wasn't too impressed with: The prices were steep- my burger was great but $12.50 is about $3 over priced in my opinion. The bathrooms are also outside- yes you have to walk outside just to use the restroom. And, they are tiny so if there's any kind of line, you're probably going to have to wait outside or just hold it. I also didn't like the limited beer menu- they do have some locals and domestics but not very many choices. Many of the beers are also served in cans- which is kind weird for this style of restaurant. 

At the end of the day, I will totally come back. But, only if I REALLY want a burger and fries (because that's really all they have other than some salads)."}
{"text":"Really good burger and the choices for fries are amazing.  We really enjoyed the truffle fries, and the green chili fries as well.  I'd have to try a regular burger next time though to be certain if the Kobe upgrade was worth it..."}
{"text":"So I only give 2 stars because I don't think you should fancy up a burger.  I've had some really amazing burgers for cheap.  That being said, the burger was good.  The truffle fries were ok...a bit too oily.  Nothing out of this world but ok.  The location is convenient being in the mall and the atmosphere is nice.  One weird thing are the cows wallpapering the place.  I'd rather not see what I'm eating while I'm eating.  Kinda freaked me out.  
Seems like a great place to grab a beer and watch a game on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Very good Kobe or Angus beef burgers and the staff was great.  

The burgers are sized generously, juicy, and you can have all the trimmings with their variety of choices.

Most people find Zinburger while shopping at this upscale mall near Biltmore, so I recommend that they stop by for lunch.  

When the weather cools off in the fall through spring,  the indoor-outdoor atmosphere where they open the wall between the two is really nice.

For those of you who are vegetarian or no-beef types, they have veggie, fish, chicken, and turkey meals.  

Would have gotten 4 stars with a more diverse menu, but specializing on the burger fits a certain crowd and they seem to be doing well."}
{"text":"Third time is not a perfect charm. My son likes this place so we came here for a late lunch. 

He ordered the simple burger and he stated it was good. 

I ordered the veggie burger.   The first burger that was brought out fell apart when I went to take a bite.  Not quite the burger I expected. 

They very politely apologized and stated they would be bringing a second. The gentleman that brought it to the table stated he was also sorry, but the first one was a patty made yesterday 

The second one was brought out rather quickly and is flavorful, but I would not call it a burger. It falls about very quickly. 

If we would ever return, I would not order the veggie burger. 

They were very gracious and took it off the bill and even gave my son a chocolate shake that was very tasty."}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend and it was AMAZING. We were told it would be about 15-20 minute wait and it said that was fine and sat down to wait. About 10 minutes later, we were seated. Wait staff was great and food was wonderful. It's not cheap, but you do get what you pay for in my opinion. Great food, great environment!! This will be a regular place to visit!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. we ordered all the fries, to taste and they were awesome! The loaded and Green Chile ones were packed with flavor! The burgers were juicy, and eat bite was seasoned to perfection! definitley a Fan!"}
{"text":"Probably not the most sensible place for a vegan to eat at, but they could still do a better job with their veggie burger. Taste was ok, but had to eat it all with a fork because it was so loose and crumbly...so, didn't really taste like a burger at all when eating it with a fork. it fell apart the first time i picked it up. not impressed either with the fries being a separate item on the menu, and for $5.00 extra at that. For these reasons, i give it 3 stars, but everyone else i was with seemed to really like it. I'd probably not bother going back, personally."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, great drinks and food. We love going here for casual dining. Sitting outside when the weather is nice, is a must!"}
{"text":"I don't really get why this place doesn't have 5-stars across the board.

I have NEVER been disappointed here, and I've eaten many dozens of times (don't want to count). The best burger I've ever had, coupled with amazing service. I suppose it could be cheaper, but you're paying for quality, location, and atmosphere. 

I wish I didn't like it so much, because I like to try new places. But Sam Fox does restaurants too well, especially this one, which just never disappoints.

Best and most consistent service I've ever had. 

Also, I hate vegetarian reviews of a burger restaurant. Come on, seriously?"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I was insanely ecstatic when I found out that Zinburger was coming to Gilbert, I have visited the one in Scottsdale so many times I can't count. 
I have no idea if my memory has fooled me but I remember the food being better. I had raved on and on about this place to so many people but when it came it was just about mediocre. 
It's trendy so it definitely attracts the crowds. I came here with my husband and then about a month of so later, with a good friend. Each time I felt the burgers were a lot more salty than they used to be. The time I had gone with my husband, we sat outside since it was almost the most beautiful day in Arizona. The table seated next to us were clearly servers that had the day off and decided to go in and have a drink. The entire meal they were so loud, cursing and saying how much they liked this server and hated another. There was constantly what felt like a crowd around their table of servers that were on the clock and wanted to come by and join in on the chat. So much chatter that our waiter who was clearly standing less than 4 feet from me, had to be waived over for more water, to get our bill and then again to run the card. We bought $100 gift cert. from Costco before going there and now I have to go back to use the money on the card but I so wish it was transferable to another Fox Concept restaurant. 

ONE MORE THING!! the one item they had offered on their menu that I kept going back for was the Bars of Zin (Kit Kat) shake sub vanilla icecream... I found out they did not serve!!! GAAAAH!! Worst day ever!! =( 

Come on Zinburger!!! Help a girl out!"}
{"text":"Nice open setting. Hostesses are very young (that's my nice way of saying they weren't good). We stood around unnecessarily until I just asked if the bar was \"seat yourself\". Thank goodness it was.  
Cool high stools at bar. Served immediately. I had the blood orange lemon martini, it was delicious and strong. Husband had a beer. 
We shared zucchini fries as an app $6, shared a burger $12. Burger was good,  but too wet (sauce) for my taste. 
They ended up changing staff during our meal and we went from being served attentively to waiting around forever just to pay.  The guy bartender went on and on about guys he finds attractive to his coworker, then the issues he has with different types of guys. I don't want to be a part of your therapy session, just let me pay my meal. 
Once we paid and over tipped...Cause that's just what we do, no one said bye or thank you.  Rude. 
Not sure we'd go back immediately."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I was a huge fan of Zinburger until yesterday. My husband and I both had soggy bread, so the meat practically slide off of the bun. I let the waitress know, and I obviously only ate a quarter of the sandwich. Surprisingly they did not offer to get us new buns etc. We spent $80+ for 3 people and a child....for that much I would expect food to be cooked/prepared properly."}
{"text":"My new manager raved about Zinburger! We tried it out, and I'm hooked. The service was fast and friendly. I got the Zinburger and it was delicious and fresh. The flavor was amazing! Best burger in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Bar service was pretty poor. It took too long to get the server's attention to get my order (10 mins) and another 15 mins to get the basic burger and fries. The place was half full on a Wednesday evening. The basic burger was decent but the zucchini fries were limp (not crispy) and were not appealing.  I asked for a double patty (extra charge) and got a single instead (which the server took off the bill). The couple next to me also had service issues. Because it was so slow, I don't understand what made this whole experience unsatisfactory. The burger was good, but not as good as any other Fox restaurant's burger and the service was bad. For their area (Biltmore) I would expect much more for the price. 3 stars is generous."}
{"text":"Really fun environment with a great menu for both food and wine. My husband and I shared the green chile fries (spicy and so good), the burger of the day which had mac and cheese on it (sooo delicious), and the butterfinger shake. Our server was great and happily agreed to split the burger and shake for us."}
{"text":"The prices are a bit high. The side dishes are really good! They have An amazing kale Cesar salad! I've never had anything like it! They're sweet potato fries are delicious"}
{"text":"The burgers here are good, but not amazing. The wait was a little long, and the service was good, but not great. We waited quite some time for our food to arrive. The burgers had flavor, and they had unique options. The zucchini fries were really good. It is worth a try if you want a burger and you are in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome service!!! 

We had the breakfast burger....and it was so good! My wife and I shared it with some fries. The fries were nothing special, and a little cold. Disappointed that they came out before the food. The zucchini stocks were ok, a little soggy. Yet, I came here for a good burger, and that I got!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The food is amazing and prompt! All the servers do a great job helping each other out and are so polite! Multiple servers were helping us with our order, food, refills, and extra sauces. Out check came out quickly! Did I mention the food was amazing? I tried the Blanco Burger and LOVED it! The guac on the burger was fresh and they gave me extra since I opted out for the cheese. I also strongly recommend the truffle fries! Try this place out sometime! #Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is a nice place. Great environment and customer service. Visited on Saturday evening and there was about a 30 minute wait which wasn't too bad others had 45/50 minute wait times. I tried their chicken Mac and cheese and it was good it only comes in a side order so the portion wasn't that big. Their burgers are all la carte and I didn't try any this time around. My little guy had their chicken tenders which is more like a chicken patty semi cut up. Their fries are really good as well they are having a kids meal special for summer only $3 so you can't beat that. For my side of Mac it was $10! Which for me I thought to be a. It pricey. I will be going back I want to try their breakfast burger which consist of an egg and bacon added on top!! 

Overall good experience a little on the pricey side for some of their side items."}
{"text":"This time my grilled zucchini was greasier and not as good. I enjoyed it so much last time I returned just for them. Waitress never came by to ask how the food was. My farm salad was a disappointment, I was expecting more quinoa than a touch. The feta tasted sour. 

Everyone else seemed happy enough. I prefer to speak up rather than write a poor review but when out with others I hold my tongue cause they get embarrassed. 

Time to drink some mint tea to settle my stomach."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Gilbert by far! My husband and I come to Zinburger all the time and we've always had great food and service! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Shotgun shaped building; long and narrow.  The decor is a skosh French-country.

Had the double burger - amazing.  Served with a side of pickles, (I believe) shredded lettuce, minced onion, tomato, and a very light amount of ketchup.

One order of fries should satiate 2 hungry adults.  Fries were good and had some potato skin on them which I really enjoy.

Busy on a Saturday for lunch.  However, zero wait for a very spacious booth!  Nice!!!

Your normal 47 year old Scottsdale \"stay at home spouse/partner\" were in full effect with their white zin buzz from 10:34 am.  Loud enough to drown out the drone of kiddos."}
{"text":"First time at Zinburger. Was there early enough and it was not crowded. We ordered hamburgers of course and both were excellent!  The frys were crispy and fresh made.  You can go other places in town for good hamburgers. But you can't go many places around town and get fresh made banana cream pie. This is excellent and worth the trip alone!  Will definitely be back. 

The only complaint is the place ain't cheap!"}
{"text":"Outstanding selection of burgers, fries, shakes... Service was great. Not fast food so be ready to relax, take your time, enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Everything we had was quite good and generously portioned.  The burger toppings were generous and fresh.  Really loved the truffle fries.  There is a decent selection of draft beers."}
{"text":"GREAT BURGERS!!! Went here on a weeknight. It was still busy enough that we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. The staff was really nice and took good care of us. 

We all loved our burgers: ZinBurger, Turkey Burger, Weekly Special, and Kobe Burger. Burgers are about $10 and then sides are $6ish. We got almost all of the sides but I highly suggest the Zucchini straws - amazing! The burgers were large and juicy. It is a bit pricey. You decide if it is worth it. 

I tried the Bacon Bloody ($8). I love bloody mary's and i love bacon so i was pumped for the marriage of the two. It arrived with a piece of bacon as the garnish - nice touch. Sadly, it fell a bit short for me but the two boys loved it. The drink tastes exactly like it sounds but it was pretty intense. 

The decor is a bit odd. There is a huge mural of cows grazing on the wall while we you chow down on that exact fury friend. Kind of creepy but we went with it. 

It was great overall! Love the Biltmore area. I really enjoy Fox Concepts restaurants. 

Eat and be merry!"}
{"text":"First time checking this place out! Was blown away!!! I will say that normally Im a no frills kind of guy. I dont like to pay more than I have to for something I normally get pretty cheap. These burgers though....worth it!!

I had the breakfast burger and wow, it was the best one Ive ever had. The patty was so perfectly moist. The bun was perfectly soft. The bacon perfectly crispy. 

We opted for the truffle fries which were pretty decent. A little salty but good. 

Overall, Id say we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Upscale contemporary burger spot makes a tasty burger and offers ahi and gluten free options. Atmosphere was a bit stark, noisy garage. Not a place we would take holiday visitors. Why the hokey extra charge for \"American-style Kobe beef\"? Is that like an extra charge for \"American-style Champagne\"?  For the real meat and beverage, you have to go to Japan or France!  Also, there is a black and white cow on the wall but the menu does not specify Holstein milk shakes so we are left to wonder. For my average American palate, I will stick with Angus beef, Korbel, and Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"After numerous attempts (25-30) to have a burger that I order medium rare actually arrive cooked medium rare, I've given up. Expect your burger to be cooked, no matter how you request it, medium well to well done. Zinburger, you have one job: BURGERS. You absolutely $uck dirty ballz in your kitchens lack of execution. Beware. And the only thing worse than complaining about your overcooked burger will be the incessant drivel of apologies you receive from all 50 \"Managers\" on duty. Pretty sure everyone's hired and called \"Manager\". Oh, and the red Chuck Taylor All-Stars you make your servers wear are lame. Least comfortable shoe ever made. Look, just avoid this overpriced shizbox and eat a Habit Burger for your burger fix. Zin ain't Zen. So frustratingly bad because ALL they do is screw up the one thing they need to do, and that's cook a burger the way their customer asks. Oh, and did I mention you get all this for about $15 a burger? The cow on the wall looks delicious. Murder it and cook it correctly."}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best.  I'm really trying to give Fox Restaurants an honest shot, because I really do want a local business to succeed. But sadly there really is just nothing extraordinary about the burgers here.  I wish I would've blown the calories on a double double from In-N-Out.  And you certainly shouldn't come here for the drinks.  Bartenders seem blindsided by pouring beer and wine, and the cocktail list is vodka-fantastic...par for the course in north Scottsdale.

I would suggest driving the extra 20 minutes to Delux."}
{"text":"The BEST cheeseburgers ever! You can upgrade to a Kobe burger for $5.00 but the regular one is fantastic. Truffle Parmesan fries are to die for as are the shakes. They Also shake a great variety of martinis. Go immediately, you won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"I suggest Trying the $14 Kobe Burger. It was amazing. It was a little wait for a seat ...usually a good sign. Also a little wait for the food, so dont come by yourself.

We grabed some wine and both had Kobe Burgers Med. They might of been the Best burgers I've had in the valley. Way Better than Deluxe. Cant go wrong with sweet potatoe frys either."}
{"text":"We stopped in here between movies during our Movie Marathon Monday at the Esplanade.  So weird that I haven't been here before considering it's not even 5 minutes away from home.

First things first...Zucchini fries...YUM! 

Outside seating on a nice breezy day...SWEET!

Sour Cherry Margarita...ok, it was tasty, but why are they so small? :( Bummer!

We also ordered the 'The Ringer' burger which was perfectly done. We asked for medium well (it was alot of food, so we split the burger) and it was absolutely, positively, perfectly, exactly medium well. And OH SO TASTY, meaty, juicy, plump (not in a Mondoburger way...it appeared to be real meat)! Just the right amount of food for the short amount of time between Looper and Hotel Transylvania. :) I'll be back because their malts, desserts and salads look fabulous."}
{"text":"Ummmm, I didn't know a burger could taste so good?  I love this place and will come back anytime I'm in the area and looking for a burger.  If u haven't tried this place and u think all places are like \"it's just a burger fancied up differently\" then u need to go here for the amazing beef.  It's so good u prob won't care about the toppings/condiments/dressings.  Suddenly my stomach is growling...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had always gone to the one at Baltimore. My friends and I did a burger challenge to see who had the best burger in Arizona. Hands down, zinburger won. Now that the Gilbert location is open, my life is complete. Try the El Diablo with avocado and zucchini fries."}
{"text":"Okay so starting off I am a vegetarian/vegan. Definitely not the most extensive meatless menu but they are super considerate and will cater to dietary needs as best they can! I got a salad no cheese or chicken and it was awesome. Everyone got milkshakes that were to die for! Portions are bigger so splitting a burger,fries and shake for a couple is a decent meal!"}
{"text":"I used to really love this place. Lately the service has been bad, the food is bad. The other day I ordered take out s California chicken sandwich and it was gross. Look at attached photo. It was a gooey mess. I took it back and the manager had the nerve to ask if I wanted another one instead of s refund. The management better wise up or this place will close."}
{"text":"The burgers are cooked perfectly, toppings enhance the burger without overwhelming. The fried chicken sandwich is as good as I have ever had. The zucchini fries are lightly Breaded and fried just right, not greasy at all. The shakes are delicious as is the chocolate pie. The ambiance is loud enough so that a crying baby does not disturb others but quiet enough to have a table conversation. The service is 2nd to none."}
{"text":"So when in a new place I like to try new restaurants, tonight was Zinburger! WOW! I had the zucchini fries and chicken sandwich, both were very good. I'm a sucker for ice cream so the Double chocolate milkshake was a must and I was sure glad I ordered it. Delicious!!!! Oh and the black tea with passion fruit was great also. I only had three glasses. 
So if your in Phoenix and want a great lunch or dinner I would highly recommend Zinburger!!!!"}
{"text":"Zinburger is my favorite burger stop. Burgers, fries, and shakes are all made to perfection. Worth every penny. We had a great waitress Megan as well! Great job"}
{"text":"Really good burger joint. Cool atmosphere and burgers are delicious!! Only complaint is that the patty to meat ratio is too little. Haha. 

Less bread please! But definitely coming back. 

Get the Kobe beef burger."}
{"text":"Having now tried all three of Phoenix upscale Hamburger Emporiums, unfortunately Zinburger is my least favorite.

The quality of the burger seemed fine, although for $10, fine doesn't seem to be enough. The regular French Fries were nice and crisp. The taste of the Burger doesn't come close to The Grind which I rate to be #1, followed closely by Deluxe. There wasn't that beefy goodness and charbroiled taste to this burger

I wanted to like this expensive burger as the location is terrific and the service, even on a slow afternoon, was quite wonderful. Unfortunately, it neither lived up to expectations or to its competitiors. 

If I am going to \"splurge\" on a Burger it is going to have to be The Grind or Delux \"after hours.\""}
{"text":"I wish I could give more a review for Zinburger, but I am not much of a burger fan. In fact, I have no interest in ever eating one. My reason for visiting Zinburger you ask? Milkshakes.

My fabulous friend, Laura, introduced me to Zinburger for their milkshakes alone. I have since returned many a time to enjoy a Kit Kat milkshake (vanilla ice cream instead of chocolate is the best!). The milkshakes are always delicious and the bartenders are always attentive. 

My Zinburger issue relates to their hours. Maybe it's not as weird as it seems, but they close at 9pm during the week. That seems really early. Even for a week night. Their weekend hours only last until 10pm which is also a bit lame. Not that I want to stay late and party at Zinburger, but I do like to get a late night milkshake from time to time (after visiting a non-burger joint). 

Keep up the good work on the milkshakes and add some hours and I may eventually pop in for a whole meal. You never know..."}
{"text":"Great burger place, great service our order came out fast (which is nice when your starving) roomy dinning area, nice outside patio. Burger was nice a juicy! I got the burger of the day which was kobe beef patty with avocado, bacon and American cheese and my boyfriend got the samburger, both great but they tasted the same..so in other words I wouldn't pay the $5 extra for the kobe beef...I've had American kobe beef before and it tasted like steak, this just tasted like ground beef which is okay but for $15? Oh and thats not including fries...it ranges $5-$7 extra.Anyways I recommend to try it out if you like burgers and shakes!"}
{"text":"I would have given them 2 stars, if it weren't for the burger being a little better than most places. The restaurant was busy, for a Tuesday night. Parking is very very easy, plenty of it in downtown. We were greeted by the hostess, she was friendly. We were told it would be 30 minutes for a seat. We decided to sit it out, so I gave them my number...that's how they let you know your table is ready, through text message. I believe they have those little pager things as well if you don't want to give them your number. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, we decide to move our wait inside as a couple seats became available for us to sit and wait. We noticed the table closest to the door was clear, but figured it was for a different group. 30 minutes, 40 minutes, now it's getting to be a little longer than thought. All this time and the table still sat there, empty....45 minutes in, I get the TEXT!!! Guess what..we get seated at that table that had been empty the last 20 minutes or so.....ugh. The table was one of the tall bar tables, with tall, rather heavy chairs with it. Although the chairs are heavy, and don't look comfortable, they turned out to be nice. We ordered the fried zucchini, and they were as we hoped, crispy outside, soft inside. Overall, wait staff was good, wait for dinner while at least one table sat empty, not so good. We might go back one more time just to see if things change....."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Zinburger since they opened in Gilbert. The best happy hour in food selections and half priced wine. And the service is wonderful everyone is friendly and always greets you with a smile..."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really in the mood for a good burger & we were so disappointed. We ordered the Green Chile French Fries and the Green Chile's were cold on the plate. We told the waitress we were splitting a burger (we built our own) & when I received mine there was very little meat on it. Biggest mistake don't tell them your splitting it, because the gentleman next to me his burger was Huge! Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I've been to Phoenix twice in the last two years and both times went to Zinburger. The sweet potato fries are definitely delicious & certainly worth $5. I've tried the zinburger, the samburger, the Kobe beef burger & the plain and simple and all are fabulous. Great service every time & sitting outside while the misters are spraying is delightful. I will say beware of add ons; if you want extra stuff you will pay for it!"}
{"text":"Exceptional, gourmet burger.  I had the \"zin burger\", truffle fries, and nutella milkshake (for dessert).  Everything was fresh and decadent.  The decor is akin to farmer/modern/minimalist.  We had a great server, who was fast and friendly.  The only miss for me was my cocktail.  I order their pomegranate moscow mule and really all I could taste was the ginger beer.  So next time I'll just stick to a diet coke :)"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this wonderful burger bar while shopping in the area. I'm visiting town and have eaten there twice in 3 days. The veggie burger is amazing and the truffle fries are sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"New to this area & always on the prowl for a great burger we tried this w Postmates. It was really good !! Loved the Waygu burger & the Zinburger was almost as good. Plus it came rare as I ordered it. Amazing. The zucchini fries were yummy. Just disappointed in the onion rings. Yes they were not greasy but really had NO flavor. Will be back !!"}
{"text":"Great food and service today. Everything was perfect. Gluten free bun was great. French fries were great and the burger was amazing."}
{"text":"Ridiculous long wait times. We were given 20-30 minutes wait, 45 minutes later we were told to wait an extra 15-25 minutes.
Shortly after asking to speak with the manager, we were seated.  He was very apologetic and nice.  Unfortunately I hate that it had to get to THAT point in order for us to get service.  Like I told him, if it was just adults we would hang out at the bar but we had our 3 daughters, including a 1 yr old (timing bomb age).  The food was great, the waiter was very nice but forgot to bring water, very scattered.  I understand it recently opened, perhaps they will get the hang of it soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful burger! The best I've had in Scottsdale! The Bruce Lee gets my vote! The quality is second to none and the service so friendly and attentive. Our waitress Jamie really made us feel welcome. Even the young girl who answered the phone was bubbly and welcoming.
Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we ordered Sweet Potato fries, Ringer Turkey burger & Zinburger with Bacon. I have to say they were Delicious!!!
Awesome food and service & Great location. Parking here was confusing but its Free."}
{"text":"Great burger and atmosphere.  If you are looking for a delicious burger this is your place. A variety of fries and cocktails."}
{"text":"Went to Zinburger for lunch today. I asked for my burger to be well done, came way under cooked.
the onion rings were great. Won't be returning. This place is extremely noisy. Don't go there for the conversation. $40 after tip for 2 burgers and and an  one order of onion rings. Go to Red Robin rage cheaper and better burgers."}
{"text":"I had to think long and hard to be fair here. I've been to Zinburger 3 times now and I think I got a handle on it. It's trendy.

Trendy is fine sometimes, but not for a $23 dollar lunch. This is Gilbert, not New York.

My first order was the Blue Boy without the lettuce as I don't find a hot burger with cooked onions and Bleu Cheese appealing. The burger was prepared perfect, the onions and cheese melded perfect with the A-1 sauce. It was a good buger, but was it $12? no. The $7 Zuccini fries were limp and soggy so I returned them and recieved more limp and soggy fries. I will give Kudos to the $5 Salted Caramel shake, that was amazing.

2nd visit. I took a chance and ordered the $14.50 Ahi burger. Ahi should be served medium rare, especially when requested. I returned it and was greeted by another well done Ahi and when I said something was told, \"we can't control it from cooking when it leaves the grill\" WRONG ANSWER!

3 Rd visit. Asian salad. It was okay. 

Not family friendly.

In this case, Trendy didn't work for me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went during lunch yesterday (Saturday) and had the best time. Service was fantastic and quick. Our loaded fries, hamburgers, and shake were delicious! The burgers are a little messy so be prepared to get your hands dirty. We were super impressed and will definitely be coming again. Our waiters were very helpful!"}
{"text":"Our first time here while at our annual staycation at the Westin Kierland. The vibe is energetic! Burgers were great!  Loved the zucchini fries. We are planning lunch there tomorrow. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is just wonderful. Whether you order one of their many burgers, a salad, or an apetizer, it never disappints me! Great zuchini fries to try ! Cool place to try a new date spot and then walk around the biltmore area."}
{"text":"Weather was nice so we chose to sit outside.  The environment was modern chill.  The table was kinda small for two people, just enough for drinks and food.  Service was good.  I ordered the cheeseburger with fries.  The burger was very tasty and cooked to perfection.  Very juices.  Didn't have to ask for refills, she kept the ice tea coming!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place a million times and finally stopped in for lunch today. We sat outside on the patio - loved the vibe. I ordered the chicken sandwich and the zucchini fries to split. She asked if we wanted the fries out first and I said no, but if I had known the food was going to take 30 minutes I would have told her yes. The sandwiches finally came out and then the fries came out an additional 5 minutes later. We asked for lemon for the water but instead we got the check. Then we felt rushed out. The chicken sandwich was awesome- had them put chipotle mayo on it. The zucchini fries were soggy, so that was disappointing. I would come back based on the sandwich and the vibe, but would hope for faster food and better service."}
{"text":"Great service & good food! The burgers were great - best I've had in a long time. Sweet potato fries were good but I've had better (like FEZ) but the best was the salted carmel shake.... So so so so good!"}
{"text":"With regards to the ambiance of Zinburger, it is quite simple and straight forward. It is a comfortable atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. 

I ordered the Breakfast Burger with a side of Truffle fries, and I was not left disappointed. The fries were tasty enough to eat without any sort of sauce, however, the truffle aioli provided was incredible. Just absolutely masterful. I almost wish that the fries were delivered as a side because they were devoured very quickly.

Magnificent doesn't even begin to describe the taste of the Breakfast Burger. The meat was so savory and so succulent, handmade within the restaurant. The avocado and egg and bacon blended so perfectly with the beef you couldn't tell if you were eating breakfast or dinner. Would recommend Zinburger to anyone looking for an exquisite dining experience for a modest price."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is tastiness overload!  A couple of friends and I went last week and we all liked it.  I ordered the bacon burger and had them add mushrooms... it was heaven.  I've had other gourmet burgers that were good too but, I especially like the bread bun on Zinburgers.  I was also a fan of the truffle fries... they didn't need the aoli they came with!  I don't really order sweets often but I ordered a shake too because the server was awesome enough to split it into 3 glasses for everyone at the table. 

The restaurant also had a cool, trendy atmosphere which was very clean.  Our server was very polite and efficient... though the kitchen did add sauce that I ask to be substituted (it was good anyway).  

So why only 4 stars?  Well, it was a very expensive lunch.  3 burgers, a shake, 2 teas, and 1 fry came to almost $60.  Be prepared!  I'd still go back but, it'll be a rare treat!

See ya there!"}
{"text":"Very Good. Solid gourmet burgers, great bar service and drinks. Wife and I will be back. Each had burgers, split a salad and fries. Just enough food. Cant remember what burger we had, but both loved it!"}
{"text":"After getting ignored service at another nearby place.  Cough cough. Kona grill.  Came here and got served amazing food right away.  They were happy to take my money as I was happy to give it for great food and service.  Bruce Lee burger is money"}
{"text":"Love Zinburger! Their food quality is always top-notch and the server knew exactly what types of beers to recommend for my boyfriend and I on my birthday. Also they made me a milkshake to go since I was so full! Amazing burgers always."}
{"text":"So pleased with our first time at Zinburger!  We came during their happy hour(which is amazing) 1/2 price wines, beers, and sides. Everyone was so nice and helpful. Our server JJ was fabulous and very informative. We shared our burger and fries and we were stuffed. This place is a must try for gilbert.  We will definitely return very soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with my kids on Cyber Monday and they ran a 25% off special.  Burgers are great and definitely can be split between two kids.  Cocktails were excellent as well as the shakes.  Wish they had a happy hour here!"}
{"text":"So there was quite a wait tonight.  I think it was like 45 mins so we walked over to Postino's for a drink.  We called ahead to make a reservation but on Fridays and Saturdays they don't take reservations.

I ordered the Ringer which had Frank's hot sauce.  I love Frank's hot sauce so It made my decision of what burger to get easy.  One of my friends ordered the El Diablo and another ordered there veggie burger.  All of them were very tasty.

I really like the huge pictures of cows on the walls. I don't know why but I do.
As for the service. It was pretty good. The waitress had some  good food recommendations when we asked. My only compliant was that on more than one occasion I started drinking my friends water cause mine was empty for a bit.

I would definetly go back."}
{"text":"A must when in downtown Gilbert. If you want an excellent hamburger that's not your traditional one then this is the place.  The atmosphere is casual, great for a date and also good for families. Has a good sized bar with GREAT beer on tap. I recommend getting here early around 1130 for lunch or 530pm for dinner otherwise expect a wait because everyone wants to come experience this great place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Zinbuger and Double Truffle Fries. The burger was great (they didn't overcook it so thumbs up for that). The fries were food, but underwhelming in comparison to other truffle fries I've had, not much truffle flavor."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here for my birthday lunch a couple weeks ago. We were seated immediately. Most of the lunch crowd was gone so the noise level was down. It's always nice when you don't have to yell across the table. 

Our waiter took our orders quickly - Kobe Beef Burgers and truffle fries. I know, they're $14.00 burgers and it's just ground beef. But they're so perfect.  It took about 15 mins to get our food. The burgers were delicious, juicy, melt in your mouth goodness. The fries, not so much. They tasted like they had been sitting for awhile. But the burgers filled us up so I wasn't too interested in the fries. 

Overall, great food and quick service. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"This place is fine: decent burgers and fries, adequate service, but long waits. However, I am BUMMED BEYOND BELIEF! They dropped my beloved \"Napa Salad\" off the menu. You don't understand: this is the only salad in existence that can make you say no to cheeseburgers and fries. It was a bowl of deliciousness with goat cheese, marcona almonds and dried fruit. Their burgers are good enough, but you could get them somewhere else without the long lines. This is so strange to say, but without the Napa Salad, I don't see myself coming back. 
**If you want to shave time off your wait, phone them and ask to be placed on the the Call Ahead List. It really does help.
**Please, please, please bring back the Napa Salad!!!"}
{"text":"Not awful, but certainly not that good. After 4-5 visits, I only go there in a pinch, or when I'm asked to meet others there.  I wish it were better, because it's so close.

The good: Decent craft beer selection, terrific service, great location, patio dining.

The bad: Underportioned for the price (sides/fries are much bigger at Delux), quality (burgers aren't as good or as imaginative as at The Grind).

I'm happy to drop $15 for a big, awesome burger and a big order of really well done fries. But Zinburger doesn't deliver that.

Went again last night for a get-together and tried the Asian Chicken Salad -- small portion for $10 or $11 and totally unmemorable. Had a nice Four Peaks Ale and Sierra Nevada, though."}
{"text":"The best seats are in the patio. Perfect weather at night and it's so pretty just looking at all the lights. I ordered the sloppy joes (because I haven't had one in years) and it was so good! Way better than I remember a sloppy joes being as a kid. I also ordered yummy onion rings and a prickly pear margarita. The drink was recommended by the server and it did not disappoint!!! I'm definitely coming back. Our server was exceptional too! My only recommendation is to train the hostesses better. They need to engage with the customer in a more friendly accommodating manner and they should know that the answer is always YES :) Hence the 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"I would love to give this spot a higher rating, however, the service was not there.

Went in today with my wife. We both had Kobe burgers (Samburger and original Burger) with a side of sweet potato fries and lemonade. He says we get refills on all the available lemonades. 

Wife got an extra order of avocados. When the burger was brought out, no avocados. Server admitted that he had made a mistake. No biggy. Mine looked good, but it didn't taste that amazing. I had medium grilled.

Then, he comes back after a few minutes and asks to refill the strawberry lemonade. Comes back a minute later: \"Sorry, we only refill plain lemonades.\" Honestly, instead of looking like a cheapo, just get the refill of lemonade YOU had originally suggested. It costs you 5 cents. We're paying $16 dollars a burger and $3 for a drink. Save some face.

Sweet potato fries were small and slightly burned."}
{"text":"It was delicious. We sat at the bar and service was good. The staff is aware that they cook the burgers slightly cooler than most people expect. Who cares,  I say? You can always throw it back on the heat but you can't take it away. Also, the beef they use isn't the crap you find in a tube for 2.19 a lb at Safeway, it needs to be treated a lot nicer. I had the El Diablo and my wife the Ringer. Along with the spicy green chili fries, it was a great meal. Expect to pay for quality food and enjoy it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Zinburger once before at another location. We were by the Biltmore and hungry....Though the menu is pricey for burgers, it is relatively reasonable for restaurants in the Biltmore. I feel like you are paying for the vibe.....which is fine with me since it really is a cool spot. The server was sharp and attentive and the Carburator burger with an egg on top was just what I needed. YUM! My husband had the Kobe burger and gave it a 4 out of 5. The only negative thing I can say about the place is that they need to eliminate the tables for two with the molded plastic chairs. I get that they have a modern vibe, but no one wants to float out in the middle of a restaurant in an uncomfortable chair while others enjoy the comfort of a banquette...just sayin' ."}
{"text":"Veggie burger was so good and the waiter was so nice and extremely helpful! Would definitely return to this location"}
{"text":"Been to the Biltmore location many times but my wedge salad was drowning in dressing, the food took WAY too long to come out and I took a bite of my son's burger and almost had to spit it out. The banana cream pie was great but that graham cracker crust needs a hammer & chisel to get through.
Love the wide open location!
Overall, much too pricey for what you (don't ) get."}
{"text":"Recently returned to Zinburger with my Foodie brother and felt prompted to write this review because he insists that the Kobe Burger is one of the best (if not, THE BEST) he's ever tasted...and he's been EVERYWHERE. Granted, he orders it rare, with a strange mixture of mozzarella, swiss, bacon and extra tomatoes but to see the look on his face when he's eating it (we've been here a few times now), it's well worth the $15-18.
As for me, I've been here MANY times since they first opened and I absolutely love their Turkey Burger (I get it with avocado, bacon, cheddar and BBQ sauce) or Clint's \"Almost Famous\" Vegetable Burger - $9 with Smoked Mozzarella, Tomato Marmalade (but I hold the mayo; not needed). I love them both. Always perfectly prepared. 
Oh, and a word about BUNS: they are placeholders IMHO so I don't like them to overpower the burger. In other words, they shouldn't be too thick or heavy and the taste shouldn't draw attention to itself and Zinburger's buns don't. They look thick but they're actually light and squishy so I can get my mouth around the burger with no problem.
All the fries are great, I rotate between the sweet potato and the zucchini style.
The banana cream pie is wonderful, as long as it comes out READY... Unfortunately, on more than one visit, we were given a pie slice that hadn't had time to set-up and was running all over the plate. Yuck. That should never happen. Management and wait staff should know better.
The only disappointment I've experienced with Zinburger is their shakes. I think the ice cream they use is awful. My family has tried almost every one on the menu (with vanilla and chocolate variations) and not one has gotten ordered a second time. That's a shame, but in a way, I don't mind because I really don't need the calories anyway...especially if I'm saving room for Banana Cream Pie!"}
{"text":"Order the SAM BURGER  and add Egg and Avocado... AWESOME."}
{"text":"Ambiance, service and consistency in terms of cooking are much better then the one in Scottsdale Quarter so we go to this one even though we live 5 minutes from the Scottsdale location. Burgers have always been cooked to temperature at this location so it's worth the drive. The new garden burger is delicious too!"}
{"text":"First time at Zinburger and there were hits and misses. The farm salad and veggie burger were fantastic! I had the turkey burger and it was the best I've had - juicy and flavorful. The sweet potato fries were delicious. The two burgers our party ordered were not cooked to temperature. Both were ordered medium well and were served entirely pink. Nothing worse then a burger joint that doesn't cook burgers to temp. One of the kids ordered a grilled cheese with cheddar and it came out with American. That reflects the poor service. I would give 1 star for service. Had to grab utensils for the entire table myself, waited forever for drinks and the waiter was not attentive. This place could be great with some tweaking."}
{"text":"So, just when I thought True Food was the star establishment of the shopping complex, I tried Zinburger and learned they are a strong contender as well. Luckily both share the same owners.

The place was super cute and inviting, but the GOP debate was a few minutes away from its start time so I opted for a takeout order instead. 

El Diablo burger with Kobe - 5 stars

Zucchini fries - 5 stars (unique, flavorful and quite filing) 

Sweet Potato fries - 3.5 stars (good but nothing to write home about) 


Service was phenomenal, the bathrooms are cute. Loved that girls are called Bessies! 

If you are looking for a creative burger, shake or add item in the area, this is a great place to check out."}
{"text":"Love Zinburger and their grass fed burgers. Only eat grass fed meat here. It would be awesome to see some expanded side options and Mabey non-dairy or grass fed milk shakes."}
{"text":"I saw so many great review on Zinburger we had to come and give the turkey burger a try. YUCK!!!!!!!!! I mean it was so disgusting we had grease running down our hands ( how do you get so much grease in a lean meat like turkey, what's the point!). then my husband had to catch a flight where he ended up belching the entire time with an upset stomach.

I know the review sounds harsh and I really hate to give such a low rating but honestly, it was the worst by far I have had for turkey burgers and a total disappointment. I thought it was also in poor taste to see some of the wait staff two tables away laughing and counting their tips and playing around. I wont be coming back. Just not worth the effort."}
{"text":"I stopped in while doing a crawl through town. I'm pretty sure my night ended here. I've also been to the Biltmore location. You can't go wrong here with a burger. I had some truffle fries that I didn't knock my socks off, but there are choices! The burger is the star of the show anyway. We sat at the bar and chatted with someone that lives next door and he loved nearly everything on the menu, as he eats there a few nights a week. Crazy! I'd try this again!"}
{"text":"One word. Blah. 

Positives:
Located in nice Biltmore Fashion Square.  The malt was good. 

Negatives:
If you don't feel like paying $50 for a family of 3 to eat a burger and frys that are completely blah.. Don't waste your time. The burger was very juicy however it had zero seasoning? I mean it is like they completely left it out? The fries were equally as blah. No salt. So there goes that theory.  My salad was mediocre.

Sadly, I'd skip this place. I only write this review for two reasons: 1) in hopes they will realize they need to season their food better and it will improve  2) to warn you not to waste your money at this time"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place because they always or just about get the burger cooked how I order it. Most places give me closer to medium when I ask for medium rare or even rare so that's a huge plus if you like either of those. The food quality has never disappointed and the service has always treated us well. Also good beer selection and very well lit establishment."}
{"text":"We had some time to kill after a schedule change left us stranded at the Greyhound Station in Phoenix. We ditched the bus station and asked a cab driver to take us somewhere - anywhere - interesting. We ended up at Biltmore Fashion Center and were dropped off near Zinburger. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=bHZobMw7BzUv5Thd211_QQ

We saw many diners enjoying burgers, shakes, and fries, and asked Ichabod if he'd like something to eat. He seemed excited about the restaurant and chose barstools for us near the pleasant outdoor patio dining area. 

We ordered:

* Roasted chicken salad with organic greens, pomegranate, marcona almonds, and goat cheese dressing  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=5lTby7rzAD3Japndi95ykg

* Burger of the day - angus and brie with truffled aioli. The flavor of the cheese overpowered the meat, but it was still tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=d0aoEc0hSLAppfbY3MNhtg

* Fries - limp, greasy, disappointing. How does a burger place mess up fries? They looked better than they tasted. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=mGD30C-GrVFNzmaCRU-9jA

* Black cow float - root beer float with a tall glass packed with vanilla ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could justify charging $6 for it, but the price made more sense when I saw the amount of high quality ice cream and the premium root beer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=kSz0KDrt4SPLOaPr26CFSw

Mr. L and I shared the salad and burger, which they split for us, and brought in succession. That made dining easy and enjoyable. 

Our server was borderline unpleasant and impatient, and gave me the impression she wanted us to order quickly and be done with us. When she gave us our check, she made one attempt at friendliness, the last-ditch \"don't stiff me my tip endzone play,\" which we witnessed her do with another customer at the bar. Strange. In contrast, the other Zinburger servers were consistently pleasant and very helpful. 

The bovine theme here is pervasive, from the cow decorations on the walls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=ljBTfOt7fXWa15uq55A_lQ to the trough sink in the ladies room. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=_-qDTkIuzpxOMk1RgJ5z4w

From the burgerlicious food to the fun atmosphere, I can see why Zinburger is a popular eatery."}
{"text":"I got the classic but upgrades to the Kobe which was so tender and off the hook juicy and amazing.  Very cool place, open and trendy.  Had a really cool feel.  I also got the banana pie which was off the hook deliciously. Definitely highly recommend this place for a gourmet burger, best in Gilbert for sure!"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy the food at zinburger. We've been there so many times that we've tried just about everything that's meat on the menu. 

The burgers are fresh and tasty and with the amount of options they have, it's easy to find something for everyone.

Price is a bit high but I think it may be substantiated because of the amount of food you get. Especially, if you order a side. Those are shareable for sure. For those complaining about prices go a half mile up the road and hit up burger king. 

I will say that I am continuously let down by the servers. Which is sad. The food is great and once a manager is involved, the managers ensure you are more than satisfied with your meal and service. It won't stop my family from coming but I'm hopeful the management team can address the lack of customer service and customer experience. 

We went there this afternoon and the server was so focused on upselling me, he didn't even notice I needed a water refill. Luckily, one of the friendly managers was walking by and got me some water. I couldn't even tell you his name, since he never told me. He is blond haired and young.

All in all, great burgers and sides and the shakes are wonderful. Staff needs to be vetted more carefully and trained in customer service. The managers are on point, but it shouldn't have to get there."}
{"text":"Great burger joint! Was visiting family this past weekend and was brought here for lunch. We have a number of hamburger spots out here in Los Angeles, but this lived up to those, no doubt!  I got the Kobe Beef and it came out great!  We also got a Nutella Crunch Malt and it too was absolutely delicious!  I would def. come back here the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"These burgers are amazing. Brought my family here when they visited out of town. The burgers are huge and the fries were excellent! Have to eat here. I don't know if they have locations all over but this place is great!!"}
{"text":"First experience with this place was less than pleasant but another fly by leads me to believe that its a decent place to eat. This time the food was good & prepared right. a little slow on filling the glasses tho but the waitress apologized for the wait. I'm willing to stop in again sometime in the future & eat here again"}
{"text":"Zinburger is my family favorite burger joint! The burger are very tasty and we are over the moon about the green chili fries they are a must order."}
{"text":"Heard this was a place to try for good burgers. We were seated quickly at the table directly behind the hostess stand. Waited for roughly 10 minutes without any service, not a \"hello\", not a \"be right with you\", not even a drink order. Not for lack of staff either- there were several staff members standing around near the kitchen and several who walked by our table. Even after making eye contact with some of them no one showed. So we got up and left. Ended up at Hopdoddy which I HIGHLY recommend if you want a delicious burger and attentive service."}
{"text":"Yum! Love the Kobe burger and the truffle fries are addictive. The zucchini fries are great too. All fries are large enough to share. I've been a number of times with family, on date night & with large group for lunch. Each time the food has been great & service attentive. My favorite thing is that they let you split the milkshakes. There are so many yummy flavors too. The banana royale is my favorite. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my burger, truffle fries and sundae the one time I went here and the service was great. It was a good atmosphere and very clean."}
{"text":"I have only had the kobe burger here but it's amazing.  The food is worth putting up with the prentensious server who undoubtedly wishes at the time they were doing body shots at some club in Scottsdale. Price is steep but the burger is amazing."}
{"text":"Jamie is amazing!!! So are the green chile fries!! Every burger I try is better than the last. Peter, the manager, treats you like family-he's awesome!!"}
{"text":"Zinburger is really cute and located in a nice shopping mall. The burgers were all super delicious and the fries were really good too. The truffle fries were really good and the nutella milkshake was amazing! Tasted like liquid nutella yummmsss. The servers were also very attentive and the food came out very quickly. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"no stars is what I give Zinburger- what I want is our money back! we waited the 45 minutes (which is normal) and ordered 3 plain and simple burger, one with no bun. I ordered sauteed onion and mushrooms on no bun. What we were served was ridiculous. 1 patty- small- sitting on a piece of pathetic wilted lettuce and a couple of pickle slices on the side. REALLY? I order A-1 sauce and of course, it was not there. The fries and the burgers were freaking cold and when we flagged down a waitress and asked her for,oh I don't know, condiments? she nodded, walked away and never came by. I had to get up and walk over to several servers and ask if we could actually get catsup or barbecue or the A-1 sauce! Zinburger - all you do is burger and fries, you think maybe you should include condiments? at least TRY to have a presentation? The mushrooms and onions were mush and inedible...and after that little experience, I had the pleasure of being up all night, ill due to eating there....NEVER will I go back there, just put my refund on my card and I'll eat at every restaurant near you but no way on Zinburger."}
{"text":"The burgers are huge and they have a great selection of cheese to go with. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly. It's a bit pricey, but the flavor and quality of the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"What happened? We've been visiting Zinburger for 3 years, and it's been one of our go-to spots in Scottsdale. 

Arriving today, we found that the menu has had quite the overhaul. And not just a few additions - a heck of lot of removals primarily. Not least removing items such as the Breakfast Burger (which every person i have recommended to try it, has loved it), and our firm favorite, the Spicy Green Chili fries. Gone, not even an interesting alternative.

It's a shame to see the removal of quite a few interesting menu items replaced by fairly uninspiring options.

Unfortunately, to top it off, what we did choose instead (Diablo Burger) was disappointing dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Overall decent dining experience, the fries were incredible! However the service wasn't up to par. We had to ask another server for our check along with refills. I would recommend Zin burger as an option but it could have been better service, other than the fries it wasn't outstanding. They do offer grass fed beef and gluten free buns!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!!!
The other night I went with my kids. The service took longer than normal.
Stephy the manager took care of the entire bill and even asked if my kids wanted milk shakes to go!
We appreciate the amazing customer service!
Thank you!!!
We will be back"}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend wanting to try one of their burgers. I ordered the sam fox burger with a side of fries. The burger was good but wasn't great, the fries were great. My bill came to $17.59, I only had water, so with tip it was $21.00. Was it worth it, no. It's overpriced by a few dollars. While I was driving home, I started thinking every time I leave a sam fox restaurant, I think the same thing, yea it was good, but why so pricey. I don't get how sam fox can charge 15-20% overpriced and get away with it. People keep showing up. So I will not be back to Zinburger, it was good, but not for that price."}
{"text":"As someone who does not usually eat meat, it says something that I rated this place five stars. 

Once we sat down, our waitress gave us suggestions and even put up and seemed okay with my dad basically telling her about his day. She was pleasant and helped me figure out what to get (vegetarians beware, you won't have many options here). 

As someone who was afraid to eat my spicy chicken sandwich due to the \"unhealthiness\" the waitress gave me support... Quite a few times. As someone who is in recovery, this meant a lot to me. At one point her coworker even gave me a high five because I ate half of my meal, which was a pretty big deal. It meant more than they'll know probably. Between the waitress and her coworker, they made the experience fun, enjoyable, and hey, they food was really good!! 

I suggest the spicy chicken and Mmm it think I'll go back for those fries! Nice outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Holy Crap! This place is great.  Awesome outdoor seating, huge delicious burgers.  I had their special burger that had fried jalepenos, cream cheese and chipotle mayo - it was one of the best burgers I have ever had.  This place is a new favorite."}
{"text":"Zucchini fries are completely amazing!! So was the buffalo chicken sandwich. What a mess the sandwich makes but still so good! First time coming here and we really enjoyed it. They were really busy but we still had good service. Next time I need to leave room to try a shake, they sound so good."}
{"text":"I went back again to the location on Camelback and my burger was raw AGAIN! For two burgers, one order of fries, and two soft drinks, a $50 bill is completely unreasonable. Especially for raw burgers. We also went to the location in Gilbert--this was better, but only for the reasonable prices of happy hour!"}
{"text":"Just had THE best burger! If you ever have the chance to have a dine out nite while in the PHX, make Zinburger in Gilbert a destination. Was told wait for first available would be conservatively 30-45 minutes. We had our text from Nowait within 20. Service staff are friendly as they get. God was EXCELLENT. 

It's an hour drive to get here. But you have to know it's well worth the drive (now in a food coma)"}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger. Not the cheapest, but they are seriously delicious.

Very casual atmosphere in a large open space with a lot of seating. However, can still get pretty busy around major eating times. Larger parties may have to wait a bit. Situated in the growing downtown Gilbert area, this is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm back home in Arizona.
My favorite burger is the BIg Bad Blue, but that might just be becasue I'm a big blue cheese fan. My favorite side are the double truffle fries with truffle aioli, truffle oil, and parmesan. They're only a dollar more than the normal fries, and trust me, they're worth it.

They also have a pretty good happy hour menu (M-F 3-6pm). Some of their burgers are only $5, which is half price of normal, and some of the sides for $3. 1/2 priced wine and beer, with a good variety of cocktails as well. I love to come here to catch up with a friend. And I've never found it to be too crowded during the weekday.

Come here, have a great meal. Go home very full."}
{"text":"After my last review, Shayna, the general manager, contacted me. Shayna quickly and kindly resolved my problem by going above and beyond to reimburse me for the dinner. Last night, I came with a party of 6. We ordered beers, fries (truffle, loaded, and green chilie), and, of course, burgers! Our server was very kind. We had fries come out first. They were delectible. Green chilie is spicy. The truffle fries were the perfect crispness and had a deep flavor. This time, I decided to get the Bruce Lee burger. It was delicious. Cooked medium, it was nice and moist. Didn't exactly love the sage in it, but other than that, I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I am usually very impressed with FRC restaurants but Zinburger left much to be desired. 

In searching out the best burger I thought that Zinburger would be a contender but I was profoundly let down. 

When considering my rating I took into account the following: Ambiance, Service, and of course Food Quality/Presentation. 

My meal consisted of a Pint of Kiltlifter, A Samburger (Bacon, Cheese and Thousand Islands) well-done, and an order of Fries. 

Ambiance: The place has a very clean look but it's nothing special. I actually find the wall mural of cows in the pasture a little morbid. \"Look, here's a picture of your food before it is slaughtered and cooked to order (for some).\" I sat at the Bar which was not busy at all. 

Service: When I ordered my beer ($5.50) it was served to me in a nicely frosted glass which I love with my beverage. However, when I took a sip I had this piece of paper flow into my mouth. I brought it to the bartenders attention and she mentioned that she had just made a shake and was wondering where that piece of paper from the straw had gone? She apologized but obviously wasn't too concerned about it and laughed it off. She replaced the beer but I was not impressed with how it was dealt with. She didn't look into the glass before she poured my drink? So that's how my dinner started and it set the tone to a consistently disappointing experience.

I ordered fries ($5) and expected something special for the price of a bag of potatoes. They were nothing special at all. They were home cut fries which were not too oily but had no seasoning on them whatsoever. They desperately required salt and pepper which is not readily available. When the food runner asked if I needed anything I replied \"Salt and Pepper please\" He nodded and smiled then never returned and instead went to bus some tables. Thanks buddy!

After I realized that the food runner only asks questions but doesn't follow through in answering them, I asked the bartender for the salt and pepper and she went and grabbed me some.

Then my burger came. ($11.50) I knew immediately that the burger was not going to be cooked properly because it came out way too quick to have been cooked well done. 

I was expecting something with a nice seasoning, cooked well (No pink, a little crisp on the outside) and with an overall flavor that would require no ketchup. I don't like to use ketchup on my burgers but use it when they lack flavor. 

I bit into this burger and it was definitely not well-done. It was medium well at best. The more offensive part of this burger was it's complete lack of flavor in the meat. It was just ground meat with no taste at all. Very bland and it unfortunately needed the help of Heinz. I will say the bun was amazing. It was soft, fresh and was the best part of the burger (which is sad).

The only time I was asked how things were is when the fries were brought out and there was no follow-up at all. It was not overly busy and there was no reason to not inquire as to how my meal was. 

Once I bit into the burger I knew I would not return because I get more flavor from a Smashburger that is less than half the price. As I write this my stomach aches because I do not respond well to under-cooked meat.

Overall, this was a substandard dining experience. Next time I feel like spending that much on a Burger dinner I will venture one mile east on the same road to Delux. They source their meat from the same company and cook their burgers much better along with having flavor which was lacking here. Their fries also come with a variety of dipping sauces that make the experience much more enjoyable at the same price point and the bartenders will actually engage you aside from just taking your order. 

I eat out every day and with a plethora of places to choose from, Zinburger will never again be one of them. 

So far this is my only bad experience at any of the FRC establishments. You can't win them all. Honestly, the only reason this got two stars is because the place is clean."}
{"text":"The burgers are definitely worth every penny! My wife and I went there for lunch today, and we loved everything about the place. My wife had the zin burger which was good, and I had the (insert some amazing name since I forgot) with A1 sauce and bacon which was absolutely to die for. The one thing that I'll go back for is the Double Truffle Fries! They were the BEST!"}
{"text":"Dreadful. We arrived at 6:30 and were told there would be a 45-60 minute wait for the patio. Okay, no problem. We'd get a glass of wine and wait. However, when we saw not one, not two, not three, but four setups open for over 30 minutes, my blood pressure soared. And that was just outside.  There were plenty of open tables inside as well.  The \"hostess\" (a gum chomping teeny bopper with an IQ of 12) told us they were paging people who had reservations ahead of us, and that she told us it would be a 45 to 60 minute wait, so what was the problem?  She finally told us she would \"take care of the problem,\" and 15 minutes later she seated us. Our waitress told us the problem was a large party of 20 put the kitchen behind so they weren't seating people, and that 15 pagers had never returned to the restaurant. 

It's a burger joint, and not amazing burgers at that. An over one hour wait when there is ample open seating is ridiculous. We will not be going back until they put some adults in charge.

For what it's worth, our waitress was great, and the outdoor atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Update:  the manager called me and he was extremely apologetic for the dining experience I received below. He will be working on training and discussing with the staff the proper way to improve customer service. Thanks for valuing my feedback!"}
{"text":"The manager asked us to come back as he stated he prides himself on good customer service. We did give it another go and it was a much better experience. The hamburgers are always tasty, so that hasn't changed. We had a little difficulty getting our drinks re-filled but this time our waitress apologized for making us wait so long and promptly took care of the situation."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I am not sure if Zinburger is a chain or not but I wish we had one back in Detroit. We have so many burger places around and most are subpar in my opinion. Zinburger on the other hand did not disappoint! 

My friend and I came on a busy Friday night and sat outside at the bar. Gotta love Arizona for having outdoor bar seating! The bartender was incredibly friendly and made some suggestions. My friend and I love to share so we ordered the Farm Salad, Grass Fed burger and spicy green chili fries. The salad was absolutely delightful and nice and refreshing. The green chili fries were extremely spicy, like need to drink a gallon of ranch with them...so only order them if you love the heat. The grass fed  burger was also very good, we had it with a gluten free bun and it was one of the better gf buns that I've had. 

I hope to visit Zinburger again someday because it was yummy!  And on a side note, downtown Gilbert in general is very cool!"}
{"text":"I typically go here on the Friday nights the Biltmore does a movie in the park.  The Kobe burger is probably my favorite of all the burgers I've had.  They'd be top notch burgers if they heated and toasted their buns more, but that's a preference thing.

I continue to come back because it's a nice place to relax and eat with a friend and I the staff are super friendly so it's always enjoyable."}
{"text":"Just opened in the Scottsdale Quarter! Excellent! Don't miss the truffle fries and/or the zucchini fries, plenty to share one order and they are on the happy hour menu! Had the Ahi Tuna salad, great and the Breakfast Burger, swapped out American for Cheddar, it was superb. Great neighborhood find."}
{"text":"I was SO excited for Zinburger as I had previously been to the Tucson location but I'm sad to say that it wasn't what I remembered at all.  When I had initially went, I still dabbled in meat and was lovin' the turkey burger.  So, maybe the turkey burger is still okay (but it doesn't seem so from other reviews) but I had the veggie burger this time around.

Let's just say I spent most of my evening puking that veggie burger up.  They put this weird tomato marmalade on it, which wasn't pretty coming back up.  Sorry for the graphic nature of that sentence.

I'm not in the business of giving restaurants that make me ill a second chance, so the likelihood of me returning is pretty much zero."}
{"text":"loved the burger and the zucchini app we got. went with my mom, sister and 2 daughters. we were able to sit in the outside area and watch the kids play in the splash pad which my daughter went after eating and played and got her clothes all wet :/ a little slower service. refills weren't as good and it was ready hot out"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, its average as far as $12 burgers go.  For my money the place to go for expensive burgers if Fez.  Very cool that they let us order ahead for our large group and the food was ready when we got there."}
{"text":"Food was delicious for my first time here! The wait for seating wasn't long nor for the time to make our food. Sure the greasy burger soaked the bottom bun but that's how you know its good (p:"}
{"text":"The burgers are good, except for the gross shredded lettuce, and I love the ahi salad. The service is horrible. We get take out from here often (with 2 young kids it's hard to eat out). They mess up on our order EVERY single time. Even when I tell them, they still get it wrong. It's so frustrating. They are not the nicest on the phone either, I'm guessing the hate to do to go orders."}
{"text":"Very happy with outstanding customer service from Zach. We had a bit of a challenge with our order, but Zach's attention and genuine care and concern made everything right. It is the human touch that makes the difference among restaurants. The food is very good, but the service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Ordered the west coast chicken burger and it wasn't bad. The truffle fries were delicious, however my friend and I experienced horrible service. The table behind was served before us- even though we arrived before they did. Our food was served by someone else and upon already having our food, our server did not even come up and ask how it was or if we needed anything. Instead she walked past our table 3 times before doing so. My friends water was empty for 10 mins before it was even filled up again. It was not busy and being super bowl week we expected better customer service experience"}
{"text":"Great service, kewl and relaxing atmosphere, and most definitely the best burger I've ever eaten. This was our first visit and it won't be the last, everything about this place pretty much captures the direction downtown Gilbert seems to be going...sort of east valley hip urban professional mixed with country-western hospitality, with a light splash of vodka, blended into a southwestern snowbird walk-a-bout tourist trap. I bet this place is packed on Friday nights.

Anyway, I had the Zinburger, my wife had the Bruce Lee burger with the Wagyu patty upgrade, and my daughter ordered the Brunch burger (poached egg on the patty). Drinks were the chocolate mint shake, a Long Tall Lemonade, and 2 of the Mule Named Ginger cocktails. Side dishes were the hand-cut fries and the mac and cheese. The burgers were amazing, perfection on a bun, the fries lightly salted, and the mac and cheese was richly flavored. 

I pigged-out big time, ate the whole burger and almost polished off my fries--I can't imagine what the large order of fries would've looked like. This isn't the place to count calories; for cryin' out loud, the art on the walls are of cows...lovely cows aspiring to become hamburgers for you and me.

We dropped $95 (not counting the gratuity) on lunch but it was worth every cent and some. I double my 5-star rating for this venue."}
{"text":"After several ventures to Zinburger, I think it's safe to say I am a fan. 
I don't eat meat, other than fish, so when I find a good veggie burger... I tend to rave about it. 
The veggie burger at zinburger is DELICIOUS. The waiter last time suggested I try it with the chipotle mayo, thankfully I got it on the side. The chipotle mayo is seriously so spicy....I am, admittedly, a baby when it comes to spicy food, so maybe don't take my word, but my roommate literally had sweat under his eyes after eating the El Diablo burger, which is layered with the chipotle mayo and jalapeños.
Sorry for the tangent. Back to the veggie burger. I really enjoyed the texture and I am a huge sucker for avocado. I get the truffle fries every time I go. They're really yummy and the flavor isn't too overwhelming like it can be with truffle fries. 

And those milkshakes are killer as well.

My only complaint is that every time I come to this location, it's like 5 or 6 minutes of standing at the door before a host acknowledges us. Other than that, the staff is friendly and the food rocks."}
{"text":"Love love Zinburger! Great burgers, fries, drink selection, and fun atmosphere. Major kudos for putting the effort into crafting a veggie burger that is fresh and flavorful (ie, a far cry from the cardboard veggie versions you often get at other restaurants)! I'd also highly recommend the zucchini fries, which are always the highlight of my experience at zinburger! 

The atmosphere is casual and great for groups and families. A little more hospitality from the servers, and willingness to go the extra mile by offering to split checks, refill glasses, etc would get Zinburger a five star review in my book!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and same result.   You walk in and get on the list.  They young girls up from say 25 minutes.   Well 25 minutes goes by and you ask where you're at on the list and they said about 20-25 more.  Pretty difficult when you have kids waiting patiently     This happened both time.  So 2 for 2 on the bad experience side Food is good when you get seated but getting that far seems to be difficult"}
{"text":"Yum! Such a great and unique burger place! Their sustainable and grass fed burgers taste so good! I recommend getting the zucchini fries as a starter, I don't know what they put on them, but they are divine. Hip and yummy!"}
{"text":"Burgers were delicious and the service was quick. Our waitress was very nice and understanding of the fact that we were in a hurry and we were in and out in about half an hour, and the quality of the food was not compromised for the sake of faster service."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding.  I would eat a burger there every single day for the rest of my life and be a happy lady.

The service, however, was meh.  There was no silverware/napkins on our table when we sat down.  We asked for napkins AFTER our food arrived and the server brought out a stack of paper napkins.  We asked for silverware after that and the server looked at us like we had 3 heads.  He brought back ONE set of silverware.  I laughed out loud at that...I mean, really.  I know it is a burger place, but come on...there are 4 people at the table, bring everyone the freaking silverware and napkins.  He never refilled our sodas and kind of disappeared after the food arrived.  One of the members of the party ordered a milkshake which came well after we were all done eating.  

If the food wasn't so delicious, I would have given 2 stars because the service was just so strange.  I will come back but will hope that I get someone that's a little more on the ball."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and food is pretty good, staff is friendly. The prices are a little steep though...$6 for a little sleeve of stale fries is a scam. Veggie burger is good, but again they want your money... I said no cheese no mayo add jalapeños and they bill you $1.25 extra."}
{"text":"Ok. I tried - Several times. But I just don't get how this place is getting good reviews for their burgers. I understand people raving over the shakes - they are AMAZING! The fries (especially the truffle fries) are super delicious too. They've got excellent, inventive cocktails and a good wine selection.
But the burgers? Bleh. 
Even if I hadn't read any reviews before I went, I would have assumed that a place that supposedly specializes in burgers would have figured out how to make a pretty spectacular burger. I guess I assumed wrong. I've tried a few different kinds but have always ended up with salty, but otherwise flavorless burgers. 
All in all this place would get five stars if it was a malt shop that served fries, but unfortunately they decided to showcase their most inferior menu item and charge an arm and a leg for it. That gets a big negatory in my book. Sorry Zinburger. I'm sure I'll be back for a shake and fries at some point, but otherwise I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"I am a great lover of burgers and this place was amazing!

One thing I found odd was that there were cows all over the walls and on the menus.

Other than that, great customer service and amazing burgers. 

Try the buffalo chicken sandwich as well!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?!... We've been waiting for a minute for this place to open and boy was it worth the wait. Started with the Raspberry Acai Margarita (phenomenal), my husband had a local beer (IPA) and the Green Chili Fries (spicy and flavorful). My husband ordered the double burger, I ordered the Turkey burger and my almost 3 year old son had a kids burger and ATE IT ALL for the first time!! All 3 burgers were fresh, juicy and full of flavor!! Our server Brandy was amazing! We will be back for sure! Oh and on a side note for picky water drinkers like myself....NOT tap water wahoo!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I'm staying away from the fries, burgers & shakes! 
Just got a salad..."}
{"text":"Good.  Not excellent, not great, but good.

I found it WAY too crowded and noisy for my taste, but I suppose that's a good thing for the restaurant's bottom line, and they probably wouldn't have it any other way.  Things like service-staff training and quality control must be top notch there, because every waitstaff person I have dealt with there is uniformly pleasant, well-informed, fast, and helpful.  Similarly, in the four or five visits I have made, I have never had a QC nightmare with undercooked or overcooked food or screwed up orders - even when my wife ordered a fairly complicated custom sandwich.  For that, they defintiely deserve kudos because it is hard to tolerate inconsistency at a place like this.  But they are indeed consistent.....but unfortunately, it is only consistently \"good\" food, nothing special, especially at these prices.

This would be an easy 4-star if they found a way to shave 20% off the prices.  Just too much green for just normal \"good\" food, if you know what I mean.

But I like to focus on the positive, so I will say with confidence that the truffle-oil fries are a real treat, and well worth the $6."}
{"text":"I ordered the No Bun turkey patty. Tried to be healthy but it was the most greasiest turkey patty ever!! Could barely taste the meat."}
{"text":"Sadly, was not overly impressed with this place. I had been to one before in another state that was amazing, but this one seems to be lacking a bit. My burger didn't want to stay on the bun and seating seemed to take longer than quoted while observing empty tables around. Perhaps a shift change or just worry that the cooks would be overwhelmed. It's w great burger, fry and shake place for sure. But with so many around it might be a good idea to step it up a bit"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Scottsdale and wasn't sure where to go and get a quick snack. Stumbled across Zinburger on Yelp and it looked tasty per the pictures. I was not disappointed. 

The vibe/decor/service was great. Me and my boyfriend both got a burger and shared a basket of onion rings. mmm Those onion rings are so good! 

Wish we got the milkshakes, as those looked delicious. Next time though!"}
{"text":"My husbands favorite burger in Phoenix, so far! Each burger is about $10. I ordered the veggie burger and it was amazing! The bun and burger itself were super soft that they just kind of fell apart, so it was super messy to eat but the taste was very satisfying. One of my favorite veggie burgers of all time! 
The one thing I would change on the veggie burger was the avocado. I love avocado, but it was just a big lump on top of the patty, so when I took a bite, it fell out. I would have enjoyed it more if the avocado was more chopped or at least spread onto the bun to keep it in one place. The fries here are also incredible. $3 for a small fry, which my husband and I split with no problem. Nice and crispy with the perfect amount of salt!
The place itself is really cool and modern looking, of course, since it's in Scottsdale Quarter. The server was fairly attentive and I only had to wait a few minutes for my water glass to be refilled. I would definitely go back here, especially during lunch time because there was no wait at all!"}
{"text":"Kinda seems like a typical Fox Concept restaurant.  I had the namesake Zinburger and enjoyed it.  Very tasty, done right, would get it again.  The fries were nothing to write home about (but I guess I feel compelled to write about them on Yelp).  They have an extensive list of milkshakes.  The Kit Kat and Creme Brulee were both delicious.  I'd go back for the Zinburger and the shake for sure, but I'd leave wishing I had some Delux fries and aioli."}
{"text":"I had a Fox Restaurant Concepts gift card. I am a big fan of True Food, Flower Child, and even Sauce--but my husband is a fast-food eater who is easily freaked out by what he perceives as hoity-toityness anywhere near his food. So ... Zinburger it was. 

We arrived around 1 pm on a Saturday. There was one party awaiting a table ahead of us. We asked for patio seating, and even though several tables were visibly unoccupied, they told us to wait 10 minutes because \"they had lots of tables that needed to be wiped down.\" 

Once seated, we were promptly greeted by a waiter who asked the now-standard question: have you been here before?

(WHY DOES THAT MATTER?? Unless there is some secret to navigating your menu that 30-plus years of restaurant dining hasn't prepared me for (is the sushi arriving on a boat or being served off a naked body? Do I have to cook anything myself? Are any foodstuffs on offer not actually legal?), you don't need to ask this. You just handed me a two-sided menu with all-text graphics. BIG BLOCK LETTERS THAT SAY BURGERS HERE FRIES HERE WINE HERE. Numbers that equal dollars I will trade you for burgers.  You are the waiter equivalent of that office d-bag who reads every slide of his PowerPoint. Don't be that waiter.)

I asked to build my own burger. Before I finished saying that, the waiter explained that they have a special right now with their plain burger that you can add three toppings. OK, that would have been a more suitable preamble than \"here's how menus work.\" I chose to upgrade to the \"American-style Kobe beef\" and chose roasted peppers and avocado (there aren't really very many topping options for those avoiding dairy, so I couldn't find a third). We also ordered fries to share, which they offered to bring out before our burgers. 

The fries were good. I don't like salty, so they were fine by me. Most people would probably add salt. 
The burger was ..meh. I think shredded lettuce is gross and kind of down-market. The burgers were the big, tall kind that photograph great in magazines like Texas Monthly but that don't actually fit in mouths. For my money, I'd just as soon eat at Smashburger. If that makes me a philistine, so be it. 

They have some very tempting milkshake flavors but we were planning to go a few doors down to try Frost Gelato."}
{"text":"Malorie is the best waitress I've ever had. Highly recommend the location at the quarter!"}
{"text":"A killer little burger place right in the middle of downtown Gilbert.

I gotta tell ya; I'm not hip. I'm slow to appreciate a good man bun, I don't look for gluten free anything and I don't know what wine goes with what. But put a well made burger in front of me, and I'm right in my element.   Trends come and go, but a quality hamburger is timeless.  

I ordered the El Diablo burger.   It was delicious.  Roasted Jalapenos, a quality Pepper Jack, and Angus beef  cooked to order (they nailed it).  Nicely done.   Our orders came out fast and the service was really friendly.  

Everyone enjoyed their meal.   The place is clean, the food awesome and the service is really good.   whats not to love?   

Come try this place!"}
{"text":"3 years ago i gave Zinburger a great review. Today we stopped in after not visiting for quite awhile. I immediately noticed the burgers appeared smaller. We both ordered burgers medium done.  My husband's Asian burger was medium well. Mine was well done,  meat grown all v the way through and crispy outside.  I ate too the middle hoping i would find a nice pink  center.  I had no such luck.  I hate well done beef. I let the server know of our over cooked meals.  She advised the cooks and removed an appetizer less than half the cost of the over cooked burger.  A customer at another table presented her well done burger also that was supposed to be medium. The server said there had been no changes in management or cook staff.  Our server was pleasant,  but appeared rushed.  The burger was Absolutely NOT a $16 burger.  If you want appetizers and beer during Happy Hour,  Enjoy yourself. If you're looking for a delicious,  juicy burger,  try In N Out."}
{"text":"Being Vegan it's hard to find places to eat at that both yourself and non vegans will enjoy. 

When I called ZinBurger to inquire about their \"Vegetable Burger\", I was told it was made with eggs but that if I could wait about an hour before coming in the chef would prepare one without eggs to accommodate a vegan. 

I though that was awesome and I was very thankful! 

So we get there and of course I order my \"Vegetable Burger\" with no cheese and no mayo. I also asked how it was prepared: fried? 
The waitress told me they were grilled, another plus! 

Husband orders the Samburger, No thousand, add an egg and we shared an order of hand cut fries. 

Food arrives, it looks good. Although I notice my burger was not grilled it was most definitely pan fried, but it wasn't greasy at all so I was OK with that. 
What I was not OK with is the fact that it is called a \"Vegetable Burger\" and it is in fact a \"Black Bean Burger\" and should read as such on the menu. If I had known it was comprised 99% of black beans I would have likely chose another restaurant to eat at.
 It was just bland I had to slather it in mustard for any flavor and I only ate half. 

On a scale of 1-10, 10 being best ever, Husband gave his burger and Creme Brulee shake a 9. 
Well good for him, I know where he can get a good burger he likes, but as for me, I'm still searching for an Amazing Vegan Burger!

SO I give 3 stars for his experience and 2 for mine."}
{"text":"Best burger for sure! Ambiance was great! The staff is very friendly and attentive , I would definitely recommend. If you're looking for a nice sit down by quick burger, it's the place to go!"}
{"text":"The loaded cheese fries and onion rings are to die for. As the waiter gave refills of \"iced tea\" to my friend there was no \"ice\" Food was really good. Drink refills slow. Only second visit. Our first visit was better we will try it again."}
{"text":"I don't visit the Biltmore much so I was surprised to find there was a sit-down restaurant located there where you could grab a meal for around ten to fifteen bucks; albeit, the total bill came to close to fifty for 3 people. I had the Turkey Burger and totally loved it. It was big, juicy, and flavorful. Our waitress was great. She was helpful and welcoming. Our group sat outside during a really nice Sunday afternoon. I got the feel of Zinburger as being a really unpretentious place in an area with a reputation of being high-end. It's a great place to go for casual dining with friends in a really trendy spot. The menu is the fine dining versions of casual food. I would definitely recommend and would love to go back."}
{"text":"I love the Zinburger on Camelback at the Biltmore and am really glad this one at the Scottsdale Quarter opened up. Once again, I had the turkey burger, but this time with a side of the sweet potato fries. I'm a huge fan of turkey over beef; not that I dislike beef. It makes feel satiated and not overstuffed. The sweet potato fries were good. I prefer baked over fried though, but I still recommend them. I love the casual / fine-dining atmosphere. I love how the restaurant feels really opened-up because of the natural light that's allowed in through all the windows and how there aren't any imposing walls to make you feel boxed in. On my first visit, I didn't realize there was outside seating as well. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I really prefer sitting outside. Sure enough on my way out, that's when I see there's an area a few feet removed from the restaurant for Zinburger diners. The surroundings are really nice because it's the Scottsdale Quarter afterall and the water fountain is right beside it."}
{"text":"My husband and I wondered in to Zinburger while in Downtown Gilbert. We had not been in before and thought we would try something new. It was about 1:30 and it was very full. About a 15 minute wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar. That was a good call on our part. The bartender Nicole was phenomenal. She took great care of us.

When we sat down Nicole gave us menus and asked if we had been in before and we told her we had not. She reviewed the menu with us and told us about the burger of the week. I asked her for recommendations and she gave us a couple burger ones and non burger ones. She got our drinks and within five minutes we placed our order.

I ordered the My Blue Boy, loaded fries, and the Nutella shake. My husband ordered the special which was the Hawaii Five-O and a mint chocolate shake. We got our shakes first as requested. Mine was creamy and thick. I loved it.

Next everything came out together and hot. My burger was cooked perfectly. My husband said the same of his. The fries were good but very salty. Probably the only flaw with the entire meal. It seemed the cheese sauce or fries were over salted. I would probably skip those next time. 

Over our service was great. The restaurant was open and airy. Nicole was wonderful. She chatted with us, made sure we had refills, and was on top of everything. I would definitely recommend Zinburger."}
{"text":"Fresh food, personalized service, open & airy environment, never felt rushed, a great experience! We'll be back. Thank you Zinburger staff!!!!"}
{"text":"This upscale spot specializes in burgers, fries and good wines to go with them. The place is a ton of fun, thanks to the cow mural on the main wall and an indoor-outdoor bar. Zinburger offers an open airy atmosphere with an accommodating bar and patio seating. The best part of this restaurant is you can order any burger with veggie patty . This restaurant is one of the best option for vegetarians. My favorite spot for burger. I highly recommend everyone trying this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night with my new beau.  We sat at the bar before our table was ready. The bartenders were amazing and gorgeous as well. Both were very polite and humorous as well. While in the bathroom we shared a great conversation about how terrible subway was. Our waiter was Joe. He was very nice and explained how they use great teamwork with other restaurants nearby. My date ordered a double with egg and bacon. I ordered a burger with bacon and green peppers, and cheese. The burger was a little soggy and moved way to much in the buns. I eventually took the buns off and just ate the meat. I do like to be more carb Conscious. The food was amazing though I have to say the decor of the place made me feel like I was in a Shasta pool store. Joe was a great waiter though loved my sense of humor. Told him I was yelping and he offered a deal about saving ten dollars to email sign up but who wants another email. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Went to Zinburger last night and guess what I tried!?  The Zinburger.

It was tasty, juicy, and salty. 

I guess, I've never had a salted burger, but I tasted some salty goodness on this burger.  Awewsome.

Our server was super friendly.  We had a group of seven and he was great about giving us separate checks.  I tried a friend's banana cream pie, and it was awesome too.

Yay for a GOOD burger!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Burgers you can get in Arizona,  They are all gourmet upscale burgers, this is definitely not a fast food place.  They do have salads and other entrees but the burger's are so good I have never tried those.  Also has a great selection of craft beers and sides (fries and onion rings).  Be aware it is a gourmet place and is priced accordingly.  A little high for a burger but it is good for sure.  Definitely worth the higher price."}
{"text":"Pretty cool chill spot, this is my 2nd time coming here and once again satisfied, this place definitely gets the Carlos 2 thumbs up. The staff is great, industrial decor is magnificent and music gives Zinburger that cool hipster vibe it deserve's. From the loaded fries to my Bruce Lee burger (2016 Burger Battle Champ) good time good vibes at the Zinburger!"}
{"text":"I had the Bruce Lee, it pretty much set the bar for burger awesomeness by which all future burgers will be judged. It has forever changed how I will look at burgers for the remainder of my life. Thank you Zinburger, I may never enjoy another burger after this."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely wonderful. I had the classic diner burger and it was beyond amazing. Looking at it, you'd think it was just an average cheeseburger. However, its taste is supreme among burgers (even more so than Five Guys and Remington Grill, which are two of my personal favorites). I will certainly add this restaurant to my \"places to return to\" list."}
{"text":"had the hav a chicken sandwich- it was very good. a bit pricey so i didn't get fries but the service was good"}
{"text":"We arrived in Scottsdale and came to Zinburger on a recommendation from a friend. My hubby and son each had a milkshake....salted caramel and banana royale which they loved. They both also had the Bruce Lee burger as suggested by the server and they enjoyed it very much.
I had the strawberry lemonade which was refreshing but tasted like it was made from a syrup vs fresh. I had the veggie burger on a gf bun without the cheese. The party was garbanzo bean based with lots of vegetables in it. Quite tasty but bland (I'm sure the cheese would have added nice flavour but I don't eat dairy). The gf bun was pretty good....not dense or dry. We had half regular fries and half sweet potato. I did not like them as they were not crispy and quite dense/starchy. Hubby and son thought they were fine.  Bill came to  approx. $60 for 3 of us....plus tip. We did not have alcohol but they are known as a wine bar too."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and enjoyed myself each time. Love the food and the staff is family friendly. The open space gives a busy atmosphere with loud knows but the seating layout creates intimacy for groups"}
{"text":"Patio seating is so nice with all the lights and it's dog friendly! The inside in nicely spaced out between seating. The wait time was about 25 mins on a Saturday night, which isn't bad. I got a samburger the burger alone is $12. Fries do not come with it. But I tried the fries, zucchini fries, and onion rings with a cookies and cream shake!! (I went all out) and they did not disappoint!! By far one of my favorite burgers! I definitely recommend trying it with 2 burgers, 3 different sides, and 2 shakes it came out to $56 before tip."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service, really great burgers and shakes.  A bit pricey but not unlike other downtown Gilbert restaurants.  Will definitely go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Delish, but beware of wait during busy hours."}
{"text":"We were on a birthday progressive last night and we stopped in for a round and some appetizers.  Great vibe, helpful staff, and what looked like great food. My husband commented that he would like to return soon to have a full meal.

After a bad experience this morning at a breakfast restaurant a couple miles away, we stopped in to eat today.  Great move!

Again, we were greeted by friendly staff who were attentive and knowledgeable about their menu.  I split the Breakfast Burger with my big kid, and we also ordered some sweet potato fries with yogurt dipping sauce.  We paid the up charge ($5) for the Kobe beef and both thought it was well worth it!  Our burger included bacon and avocado, and we swapped cheddar for American cheese.  The sweet potato fries and sauce were tasty!

My little kid had the mac and cheese, which he enjoyed (and he usually only like box style mac and cheese).  He was also delighted to find that they have orange soda, which many restaurants don't.

My husband ordered the Blanco burger and says it was, \"delicious.\"  Our waiter, Alexander, recommended that my husband add guacamole (he staked his reputation on the suggestion) to the green chili fries.  He was right--they were a hit.  I don't believe there was a crumb left on the plate.

My in laws ordered their burgers without buns and both come on a generous bed of lettuce that was used in place of the bun.  This is a great option for those with gluten allergies or those watching carbs.

Our family was extremely happy with the service and food.  The ambiance, as was the case the evening before, was friendly and bright.  We will definitely return to this new favorite."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time not long ago and the big hype. I'm a huge burger lover, but I can't say that I was overall impressed. I may have just ordered the wrong thing. Thats why I'm giving this a 3/5 star first. I'll be back again to try it once more at the very least.

For the price, I expected it to be on par at minimum with my other favorite and very similar burger joints. I got a beer and a burger. The burger wasn't just all the flavorful and seems to lack something. I waited quite awhile for my check after finishing, on what seemed to be a slow day. 

Food taste: 3/5
Customer Service 4/5
Food Price: 3/5
Restaurant Cleanliness: a 5/5"}
{"text":"Best Turkey burger ever!!! My daughter and I shared one today and it was awesome. Maybe best in town. We were told the turkey breast was ground fresh and I believe it. Bartender was awesome. No cocktails but he served us and I give him 2 thumbs up too! Will make a special trip back for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to in the summer because they have great burgers and a $3 kids meal with amazing burgers and a drink. That have lists of burgers if you are not a kid. When you are finished I always get a shake because they are the best I've ever hade at a burger restaurant. Overall this is my favorite restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"OK FOLKS......HERE ARE THE OLD TOWN GILBERT RULES
1- go there any  night during snowbird season???? EXPECT LONG WAITS!
No.....expect crazy, off your rocker wait times !! 
Nov- mid april

ZIN BURGER... First you need to accept the fact that 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 beers are going to run you about 50.00 tip included.
Substitute hard liquor for a beer and you're at 50.00
A soda is 3.00
Beer- 5.00
Fries- 5.00
Burgers- 10.50-13.00
Mixed drinks-7.00 +
So a standard double cheese, fries and a coke with cost you about 22.00 with tip.

The double cheeseburger i had was tastey and the fries were also good.
Both tasted very similar to 5guys brand.
2 burgers all the way, 1 frie and 2 soda are almost 30.00 at 5 guys.
Hmm....me thinks 5 guys prices are really nutz !

In the end, i will not be making Zinburgers a habit simply because of price.
The same reason i stopped going to 5guys. At some point the burger $$$ madness has to stop especially when there are tastey, affordable alternatives."}
{"text":"Thank you to the person form FRC that contacted my husband today. My husband spoke highly of his conversation today and our only wish was that your hospitality and response was what we would have received at the time at the restaurant. Thank you for showing the true nature of the hospitality of your company. We don't blame Zinburger in any way for what happened. What was truly disappointing was how management responded after the fact. Thank you for making that right today!"}
{"text":"5stars the food and the people make this place 5stars. Here's what I don't understand, why food places feel they need to open the doors when they don't have  fly fans over the doors. I come to eat,  not swat and wave flys away from my food. When temp. outside the flys become increasingly more prevalent. Also if it's starting to storm and doors are open flys will migrate inside to get away from the storm. So for the health & comfort of your customers close the doors. Customers that don't mind flys can request seating on your patio or go on a picnic. Dig the food & the employees not the flys."}
{"text":"The food is good. The place is clean. Fries are great. And they have drinks or shakes. What more could you ask for. Also they offer salad, and lighter fare if you wish."}
{"text":"Burgers overpriced, buns stale, fry's cold, nothing special!   Nice atmosphere, but not worth the wait.  4 people, hamburgers, fry's, iced tea, over $80 bucks!   Hmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered veggie burger (no mayo) and zucchini fries. 

Wife and son ordered smokehouse (samburger) burgers and shared a loaded fries. They enjoyed both very much.

Youngest son ordered chicken strips meal, which looked like a flattened breast breaded and sliced into strips, not your usual shaped nugget.

Green tea for me, Pepsi's for everyone else. 

All very good, I do not regret stopping here today.  Service was relatively quick being pretty busy on this Saturday lunch time.

Damage for 4 of us for lunch... $61 and change.  A little pricey, but we like trying new places."}
{"text":"Just had the Farm salad and the prickly pear margarita... Super impressed! Great friendly service, great energy, wonderful food. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was a tough review. The burger was good, the shake was good, and the service was excellent.

This would have easily been a 4 star, if not 5 star rating if their grass-fed beef wasn't $5 extra. Grass fed beef shouldn't be a $5 extra luxury. There are moral and ethical reasons for not eating factory-farmed beef from the largest beef manufacturer in the U.S. (JBS) , but there are also people that really need the grass-fed beef to feel physically well after consuming a burger. I am one of those people. And their grass-fed beef didn't let me down.

I don't choose the upgrade to be trendy. A dollar or two would be reasonable. But $5 extra for less than 1/4 pound of beef is just greedy. What planet are you on, Zinburger?

I guess I'll just have to make grass-fed burgers on my grill at home."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service.  I had the Bruce Lee burger, it was very tasty.  The chef cooked it perfectly medium and the beef was well seasoned.  The only negatives were my lemonade was served in a dirty glass, which they replaced but not very timely.  The server was nice and very helpful, just not very organized in her rounds.  She did have a fantastic desert suggestion, the banana cream pie!  Wow!!  If you go there and you remotely like BCP then make sure you leave room or share with a friend.  It is a must have! (See pic)"}
{"text":"Have been to Zinburger twice.   During the two trips items ordered by our party were:  Zinburger, Samburger, Kobe Burger, Plain and Simple Burger,  Hand Cut Fries, Zucchini Fries, Banana Creme Pie, Iced Tea.  The best item out of the food items listed, in my opinion, was the Banana Creme Pie.   The burgers did not \"Wow\" me.  On top of that the food was laden with an exorbitant amout of salt.  The zucchini fries were so salty after about three bites I could not eat any more.  As previous reviewers have stated this place is expensive.    I think there are better hamburger places to be found."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening and the place was packed. Good sign.
I like that this place was accommodating to our large group. Our server (bad with names) but she was the most awesome server ever! Very happy, helpful, and energetic gal! She was great. 
I've tried a couple of the shakes and the mint chip is my favorites! It's not overly minty which I like.
Everything on the menu is worth trying in my opinion but spread out over many visits. 
It's a bit pricey but if you order and share it's not bad for the quality and taste you're paying for. 
Loud, nightlife atmosphere."}
{"text":"came here last night before seeing a movie & I just love it! we made it for HH (ends at 6) where all wine -- glasses & bottles are 1/2 off. the newton cab/merlot is 10glass/40 bottle & we were splitting it between 2 people so we went with the bottle for $20. cant beat that! then during HH all apps/side are half off.. so we got the zucchini fries & truffle fries). the zucchini fries are amazing -- breaded perfectly. I made my own burger (which is best to do during HH because the base burger before add ons is $7 rather than $9.50) , but they do have some good combos on the menu. The burgers are perfect size 7 so tasty!!! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer!  I had a special of the day, formage a trios. A burger with three different types of cheese and I added bacon. Fries, onion rings and what a feast!   Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really don't like hamburgers that much. I know this makes me un-American, but it is what it is. I was at one point dragged to this place since a bunch of friends were meeting up and I wasn't about to miss out on fun times because I don't like burgers. So, I sucked it up and went. There is a huge cow mural on the wall, beckoning you to eat him, or one of his family members. So far, so good. I ordered a few drinks, all of which were very good (although pricey). I got the Kobe burger, and good God was it delicious! It melts in your mouth, and all of the flavor is there, stewing in the juices of this mighty burger. I have been back here several times since and without kicking and screaming. This is the only burger place I really enjoy coming back to. Also, the milkshakes are to die for (cookies n cream FTW!). Go check these guys out. Soooo yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this place especially the ahi tuna salad. It comes with cashews and it is amazing! It is on of my husband and I's favorite Sunday restaurants, sit on the patio have lunch and a glass of wine. The only downside it service is hit or miss. We have had great waiters and then some real duds who forget to validate our parking after we gave them the token. Other than that I suggest going. Oh and their sweet potato fries are a must have!"}
{"text":"Tried Zinburger on Tuesday with two friends. 

Had the basic cheeseburger, zucchini fries with ranch, and a lemon cocktail. All were good, nothing fantastic. 

Bill was $31. 

Over-priced and over-rated. I'd honestly rather take my calorie splurge over to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"The burger itself (daily special: $10 for angus, cheese, ranch, bbq sauce and an onion ring) was great but I'm not sure what constitutes it as a $10 burger.
Also split a side of sweet potato fries - not the best I've had (they were seasoned with a crunch but no glaze or anything that really popped to make them stand out among other fries I've had) and the yoghurt dipping sauce was just about flavourless.
The Kit Kat shake was amazing, though - real ice cream with real chocolate and Kit Kat blended together.
Got a burger, shake and split a small basket of fries for under $20 not including the tip. I suppose that's not bad for a dinner but is still a little much for cheap eaters like myself."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  Fries were gross and the burger did not have any flavor.  Sad, I expected more"}
{"text":"This place is awesome... from the open concept to the food. Great atmosphere and friendly servers. Ordered the onion rings and loaded fries to start off. Both were delicious. The bbq sauce that comes with the onion rings taste so good! It has to be homemade. And the loaded fries are ridic. Def can be split between a few ppl. Also had the Samburger. I asked for medium but came out a bit of on the medium rare side. I still enjoyed it. I'll have to come back and get one of those milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Dang. Best burger in Phoenix imho. Really like the zucchini fries. One of my new fav's in Phx. Highly recommend. Haven't been able to pull out six bucks for a shake yet tho."}
{"text":"Lately, I've become a huge fan of eating at the bar area of a restaurant. This may be because I've become as inpatient as an 85 year old granny, but I'm digging it nonetheless. Say at the bar with one of my coworkers on our last trip, and it was perry delightful. Efficient service, four peaks on draft, sweet potatoe fries, and a good quality burger. Nice crowd,  and good noise level for such an intimate little restaurant... Overall, solid!"}
{"text":"Would give more than 5 stars if I could!! We had the samburger with loaded fries and it was plenty for two people! Fries came out cold but manager came by and fixed that right away! Watermelon mojitos were amazing!  Service was top notch! Excellent experience all around!

Our new favorite for sure! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent burger place. Usually come here with a large group and they have always been able to accommodate us immediately. The El Diablo burger is great. I sub the onions out for jalapeños. Great local beer and wine menu. Bar area could be a little bigger to accommodate people who are waiting for a table."}
{"text":"* I received a response from the owner, who communicated their ingredient and food quality standards. I appreciated him reaching out, as well as their commitment to better quality ingredients, so we will go back for another try. I upped my stars by 1 to acknowledge the message and will update again after our next experience :)

Our server was very pleasant and the food is ok. But, not like... good. My husband got the seared ahi, and the bun fell apart on his first bite. My veggie burger was ok, but was pretty bland overall. All of the sandwiches are pretty expensive and do not come with a side, so that cost is truly just for the burger. My husband and I got the sandwiches, split the zucchini fries and drank water, yet still managed to spend $40 after tax and tip. Honestly, I have zero desire to return.  
P.S - they also have the brazenness to charge $5 for Coors Light or Bud Light. Everything is a good $2 too much."}
{"text":"I cannot get Zinburger's Truffle fries out of my mind.  Every burger I have tried here is delicious.  Service is quick and efficient, and I leave thinking about the next time I should allow myself to go back (if I could, I would go here every day).  The one thing is that it tends to get busy during lunch hours and on the weekends, so I would just keep that in mind when deciding to go.  I have just recently relocated to Los Angeles, and wish they would relocate with me.  Try this place out!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW!!!!

Super great food!! Kobe burger and their fries was one great taste sensation after another and to top it off have one of their amazing shakes to lead you on your way to a happy food coma"}
{"text":"Good burgers but totally overshadowed by the hour it took us to get our food. The server was great but the kitchen was overwhelmed. The place was about 75% full on a Sunday afternoon and we were a party of 10. But Really?!. Price was probably right but have a hard time going back. Fries and zucchini were also good but a little rich. But who doesn't love queso? Atmosphere is very cool when the weather is right but all in all once was enough for me. Prob won't be back."}
{"text":"I marked a 3 just cause there is no combo so makes Things real pricey real quick. $14 for the burger $6 for the fries that's $20 already without a drink. Id rather get a nice 3 course meal for that price not a burger I don't care how good it was. Oh and I had \"the diablo\" which was suppose to be hot with pepper jack , jalapenos, caramelized onions....thing was candy with no spice. Very disappointed. Nice joint though..."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Nice atmosphere and good service.  The only negative is that the prices are a little high for a burger joint.  With that said, still think it was great food!"}
{"text":"Medium rare, cheese and bacon, blood soaked bottom bun, perfect. Zinburger is awesome. I've yet to find a burger I haven't liked but I'm partial to the Sam, don't overlook the chicken sandwich however, it is super tasty and all of the fries are on point. Where else can you go and stare a giant cow in the eyes while eating his family? Incredible shakes, fair beer selection, cool atmosphere, four stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get some drinks. They have an excellent selection of cocktails and beers. The facilities was clean and the wait staff was friendly but due to how busy it was, there was a bit of a wait to get our orders. They were apologetic and nice. The atmosphere is laid back and there mission to provide fresh, healthy food is important. They have a delicious prickly Pear Margarita I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Get the Bruce Lee, it is awesome!

I ate there for the first time yesterday, and since going, I've been thinking about that burger for about 24 hours now. It was so good.

There is a kids meal and they have high chairs for younger ones if you are interested.

Service is great, atmosphere is great, and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Just a great burger every time. I had mine wrapped in iceberg.  Fun, fast and tasty.  Kobe is always wort it. Green chili fries and a old fashioned shake.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"WE LOVE ZIN BURGER. 

When we are craving a burger/chicken sandwich we pop on in. Normally everything comes quick, hot, and delicious. Not to mention the staff is cute and friendly. 

Like to know where the meat comes from? look no further than the walls showing happy grazing cow cows. I felt weird about it the first few times but you know... It makes them different?

They have multiple beers on tap and they make great cocktails. I must mention though... The blood Mary's are LACKING. Sorry but I literally hated mine, a few times... It took me awhile to just accept how bland it is and there is nothing you can do to make it better."}
{"text":"Been really wanting to try Zinburger and finally made it, geez...

I got the Zinburger as is and my companion added bacon.  It was a pretty good burger.  Though I enjoyed the sweet potato fries and the double truffle fries more...  But, the companion said it was probably one of the best burgers he had eaten...
Personally, I won't be rushing back to Zinburger, but I'll probably be spending my time and money at one of his other dwellings, oh bloody hell!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox comes to Gilbert!!!! Yayyyy!!!! 
^that was my initial feeling prior to dining at the highly anticipated Zin burger. I dined here opening week, and again three days ago as a second chance in hopes the kinks would be worked out. Not so much. 

The servers on both occasions seemed unfamiliar with the menu specifics and lacked the confidence and personality I am used to from the other Fox Concepts. 

Both visits I ordered the same thing....sweet potato fries and the garden vegetable salad. The fries keep this review afloat. They are perfectly crisp, and the dipping sauce is nothing you would expect but everything you would want. Yum. Order two servings. 

The garden vegetable salad has all the makings of a vegetarians dream, with the added bonus of the almighty quinoa to boost the protein. Too bad they DRENCH it in salad dressing. I had to actually spit it out because the dressing was so potent. Pools of it in the bowl and the spinach looked like seaweed from being so wet. I asked to have another one with out the dressing and it took them 25 minutes to bring the new one. The manager didn't verbally address me, or the soup....I mean, salad. She did comp the salad, but I have no incentive to go back for another round of this. My husband is probably accurate when he said \"you can't order a salad when you go to a burger place\"."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian not the place to be but friends wanted to visit and they do have one vegetarian option, the Clint's \"Almost Famous\" Veggie Burger. 

First the good, the service was decent. There was a bit of a wait, even for a Sunday night, but the hostess was friendly and we got a table after only about 5 minutes. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. She even reminded me to have my parking token validated (which I always forget at this mall) No complaints there. 

The food was OK. My tablemates ordered a Simple and Plain Burger (he was a kid), a craft your own burger and I ordered Clint's \"Almost Famous\" Veggie Burger. Keep in mind that this is an a-la-carte restaurant. If you order a burger, you get a burger. Doesn't come with fries or other accouterments. My guests seemed happy with their meal. My Clint's \"Almost Famous\" Veggie Burger wasn't all that great.  To be called \"Almost Famous\" I was expecting more.

The bad. Well, that must have been the acoustics, virtually impossible to have a good conversation. Typical Fox Restaurant really. Provide a decent looking place with good-looking staff, decent food but insure the noise level encourages relatively quick turnover."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good location but sub par food. My wife and I both got burgers, both were very greasy leaving the bun soggy and falling apart. I would suggest Pomo Pizza in the same area if you are looking for a place to eat in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place.... I don't have words to describe the beauty that is Zinburger.... Great atmosphere, amazing staff that is knowledgable about the menu and the product. The food though, is phenomenal! Great concept and I love me a good burger but I am not easily satisfied and this place has burgers down to a science. The French fry selection is amazing, we went with the spicy green chile fries and they exceeded all expectations. For the burger I had the El Diablo, while my fiancé had the weekly special and we loved both of them and even the dessert menu had amazing choices. If you haven't tried this place it's a must for locals and visitors alike!"}
{"text":"If burgers could walk, talk, and go to school... This is where they would come to get their masters. If you're craving a burger, on a streak of making poor decisions, and live within 120 miles of a Zinburger it's time to turn your situation around and treat yo self. A lot of recommendations out there for specific burgers on the menu as there's different strokes for different folks so pick which sounds best. As far as I'm concerned the only way you can go wrong is if you ask them to hold the patty and bun. As far as the service goes, I personally have never had an issue but that's mainly because I don't go looking for them. Chances are your server isn't purposely neglecting you to receive a poor tip. Maybe, just maybe.. They had a table of 8 come in with two kids and the group didn't call ahead of time to get high chairs ready, Aunt Karen can't decide if she wants regular water or soda water because \"she's always enjoyed both but both seems like too much right now\", and now the eldest child wants crayons and warm milk through a straw. So Jim Bob, Have yourself a light beer and a conversation with your miserable significant other for 15-20min and prepare yourself for greatness because these burgers have enough salt on them, your saltiness will only spoil the taste. Keep grillin up 5 stars Zinburger."}
{"text":"My turkey burger looked stunning but it had too much dead turkey and too much pointless potato bun. Lots of watery mess came out of it. The garlic mayonnaise was disgusting. Somehow the Swiss cheese didn't compliment this pile of dripping ooze. 

The outside seating area is wonderful thanks to its location next to the fountains in the central promenade of Scottsdale Quarter.

Update: Back again a month later. This time I had the Ahi salad. It was insanely good. Much better than other chains like BJs or Yard House. When i read the description I was concerned about the lack of wasabi. But I think it would undermine the rich flavor of the peanut sauce, cashews and avocado."}
{"text":"First time at a Zinburger and it was amazing! Only a 5 minute wait, my friend and I split zucchini fries and sweet potato fries and they were delicious. I got the turkey burger and it was perfect, the texture, taste, everything, just incredible. My friend got the blanco burger and finished it in 5 minutes, never set it down once! Said it was the most amazing burger she has ever had! Our server was great, never waited for him and he was fun to chat with! Even got us to get dessert which we never do, the chocolate cream pie was a perfect end to our meal!!! I would absolutely suggest everyone try this place out if you love burgers :)"}
{"text":"Zin, zin, zin - Yes, yes, yes!
Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server, Candace. I arrived early, inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner, Candace offered a sample, very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner. 
We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees. I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe.
With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an
a subtle breading on the zucchini.
We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch. The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun.
Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week.
My hats off to the Sam Fox team, another winner at ZinBurger."}
{"text":"The Zucchini or Green Chili Fries are deep fried and sprinkled with salty pebbles of crack.  You can't go wrong with their beers, cocktails or their 4-6 Happy Hour.

For what it is and for being a burger joint, the food/service/atmosphere are as good as they come."}
{"text":"Food is always great , however service is all over Sometimes the female waiters ignore you or have attitudes !! The male waiters are usually great ! It's really hit or miss . The floor is soo slippery I've almost fallen two times. But I do love the food . Staff needs work especially younger females ."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday for lunch. Restaurant was still fairly empty and we were seated right away. Our drinks were strawberry lemonade and ice tea. Both tasted fine, but the outside of both glasses was dirty which was an immediate turn off. We ordered a burger each and an order of the truffle fries to share. It took a long time for the food to come out considering how empty the restaurant was at the time. Finally our food arrived and while everything tasted decent it wasn't spectacular. The burger was so big that there was no way to pick it up and so fork and knife it was. The burger patty itself had no flavor and strangely fell apart into small pieces. The worst part was that both my husband and I ended up with stomach cramps and something that could only be described as a mild case of food poisoning almost immediately after finishing our meal. We shared the fries, but had ordered different burgers, so we think that either it was the beef or the fries that made us sick. Definitely not the experience we were looking for! With so many other great places in Gilbert to choose from I don't think we will ever be back!"}
{"text":"Now that I've explained that Hop Doddy is so BADLY AVERAGE, let me tell you what is 
NOT badly average: ZIN BURGER!

I've had a long time coming around to Sam Foxes restaurants and to be honest with you, I don't know why.  \"North\" is terrific, their Italian restaurant and any of their North locations and Zin Burger is just a terrific burger.  ABSOULTELY TERRIFIC.

I've said before in other reviews, when I first go to a burger joint, I get a standard burger.  It's like the marinara at an Italian restaurant; it speaks volumes.  If I taste the spaghetti sauce at an Italian restaurant, and it tastes like Chef Boyardee, there's no reason to try the rest of the menu.  An Italian friend of mine used to say, \"How's the gravy?\", and he wasn't talking brown gravy.  So, my first time at Zin, I got the basic burger, the Samburger: applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, lettuce and 1000 Island.  I can't say it any other way or stronger: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  

Say it again: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  

Because this burger was...IS so good! I have no idea about the flavors of the other burgers.  Never had 'em.  Never ordered anything other than the Samburger.  Why would I?  I found a great burger.  I have to assume they're just as good, in their own way, in their own flavor.

Looking at the menu just now, I've noticed an Angus Beef Sloppy Joe...I could try that!  I could probably be talked into their Bleu Cheese Burger...but then I wouldn't have a Samsburger...

And just so you don't think from my sub-standard review of Hop Doddy, that price is most important, it isn't; this burger, even with the bacon already on it, is $2 too much...and, by God, it's worth it!

I find the staff's at both Biltmore/Chandler to be very friendly, well-trained (except for the waitress at Chandler who said, and I'm quoting, \"...you cannot get e-coli at Zin because we grind out own beef\".  Sorry, baby.  That's got nothing to do with e-coli.)

Almost forgot: the fries.  Let me just say this: I like regular fries and not for $6 or $7 bucks.  The standard fries here are excellent, $5.  Save the room, eat the half your dining companion couldn'f fidn

I've said it before and I'll say it again: Zin Burger, Freddy's, Lucky Boy.  Best burgers!"}
{"text":"This is a great burger spot and one of the better locations in the east valley. I still like 'Deluxe Burger' better (and several others of similar style). But, this was a sorely missed restaurant in Gilbert. 

The Diablo Burger is my favorite and has been very good on multiple occasions. 

Since their opening the service is getting better and quicker. All and all - very good spot."}
{"text":"So the hubs and I were starving yesterday, I say hey its the last day of restaurant week, lets go try out Zinburger...Totally didn't read the FAQ that RW is only for dinner, so that was a bummer, but oh well. 

We got there and a few people were standing around waiting, the hostess said it would be a 15-20 minute wait, I think we only waited about 10. 

Our waitress was awesome, she was really nice and quick. 

We both ordered Zinburgers medium well (as those fancy burger joints like to serve their burgers bloody) and a side of Fries. She asked if it was ok that the fries came out before hand and we said sure. 

Now, for $5 for a side of fries, I was expecting a large portion. If you go to the Original Wineburger (19th and Bethany) and order a side of fries its a small for like $2 that would easily feed 2-3 people or a BUCKET of fries for under $4 that could feed 3-4!!! So right there Zinburger looses a star, the prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!! The fries were tasty, but nothing special and certainly didn't warrant the price for the portion, the portion is a joke and isn't a good size to split with anyone. Lame. 

The burgers came out about 10 minutes after the fries. They were fantastic! I almost ate the whole thing (But I wanted to save room for the shakes) But again its the pricing that gets me and keeps me from giving this place 5 stars. I would have been ok spending $8 on these burgers, but $10 for a burger....that doesn't come with a side is dumb. I know its at the Biltmore and all but damn people, its JUST burgers. 

We ordered a kit kat shake to split. They brought out our shake in two smaller portioned glasses, that was a nice touch. The shake was good, but kinda soupy. The whipped cream is for sure out of a can. 

Overall it was a good experience. Would I go back? Yes. But I wont be happy about being bent over and robbed. 

If you want a great burger and don't want to take out a second mortgage on your house, then go to The Original Wineburger on 19th and Bethany, the burgers aren't as fancy but just as good or maybe even a tad better. The prices are right and you can order a couple Baviks and appetizers and pay less then you would at Zinburger."}
{"text":"I'm simply addicted to the grass fed burger. When I'm in town I eat here as much as possible. Pairs great with a glass of Reisling."}
{"text":"I have never had a turkey burger that blew by mind the way Zinburger's did. Seriously, it was one of the best meals I have ever had! The flavors of the turkey, avocado, cheese and plethora of spices meld together for a taste explosion! Combine it with either the zucchini fries or spicy green chili fries, or both (as I did!), and you have yourself a deliciously \"zinful\" (yes, I had to pun it up) feast .

We also ordered the wedge chop salad, which was also extremely tasty. This was our first time eating here, so I am very excited to try many of the other items listed on the menu. Particularly, the grass-fed burgers in various different flavors. The food has a way of combining decadence while still feeling wholesome & healthy. 

Additionally, we ordered via phone for pick-up. Not only was the guy on the other end very friendly, but our order was 100% accurate and ready in 15 minutes as they said. With our recent luck (or rather unluck), this was a breath of fresh air!

I HIGHLY recommend Zinburger for any meal and for any craving!"}
{"text":"Visited Zinburger for the first time on New Years eve and was happy to find that it was open. I have lived in the area for about 3 years now and have been wanting to try it out for a while. 

The inside of Zinburger is modern and clean lined. You can feel that they care about beef. I mean they have huge cows on the wall, they must care about it! The only thing that was missing in that picture was a couple of UFOs. 

They had a hamburger on the menu called the Zinburger. I had to try it since the name of the place was Zinburger, so it must be their signature hamburger. It was 1/2 pound of hamburger with grilled onions on top. I was kind of skeptical of the grilled onion combination because I've grown up with lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard hamburgers. I rarely eat hamburgers anymore because let's be honest, there is a lot of shitty burgers out there and it is hard to find a good one. There really is a science to cooking the meat right and I think a lot of grillmasters foul it up. The burger I got was cooked perfectly and I was also pleased with the bun they used on the burger. This wasn't just some soggy bun you'd buy off the grocery store shelf. It was so much better than that! It was hands down the best hamburger bun I've ever tasted. I bet they make the bread in house which just shows the extent they go to make a quality burger. 

We also had the sweet potato fries. This is the third place I've been to in Phoenix that has had em. The dip that the sweet potato fries come with really make them taste good. 

I went to Zinburger and I wanted a REAL burger and I was not disappointed. Next time I go I want to try their shakes which I have since heard are really good."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was prepared well. Defiantly recommend trying the loaded fries. If you want to keep your burger in one grab able piece keep it simple. They don't hold out on ingredients. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  If you are looking for a nice  place for fun burgers, this is it!  We had the zucchini fries to start.  Nice cold glass for the brew!  

Loved the Bruce Lee burger. Just enough spice to make it zing, and super flavor.  Also shared the Chuck Norris, but next time I will ask for the BBQ sauce on the side. Ended with a salted caramel shake and banana cream pie.    Awesome!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Just had the jalepeno popper burger and it was probably the best burger ive ever had!  My only complaint is that for $13 a burger i wish you would get some fries and not have to order a la carte.  prompt service and excellent quality!"}
{"text":"In one word: overrated, just like every other restaurant on this block (maybe with the exception of postino). Zinburger is catered towards hipsters and soccer moms who think casserole is a good meal. 

The service is sort of laughable. Our waters were empty so many times I ended up getting up and pouring water from the pitcher close to us.

I had a veggie burger and zucchini fries. The food took a while to come out and the server messed up my order. The veggie burger was not bad. I eat meat and I'd consider getting it again. The bun was just so sad. It was dryer than Arizona in the winter. I ended up eating the burger with no bun because I couldn't swallow the bun-- especially without any water in my cup. The fried zucchini was alright, but it did lack salt. I also tried my friends burgers and they were not seasoned or cooked well which is a huge issue for a burger. Save your money and find somewhere less pretentious."}
{"text":"I became a fan of Zinburger in Miami and was happy to find one here in Scottsdale.  We went on a busy weekday night and were able to get seated within about 5 minutes.  The front house staff was friendly despite having to deal with some other rude customers.  I was impressed with their composure dealing with abrasive customers.  Our server was very friendly, but also very busy.  It took a little longer to order than expected, but the atmosphere was good and so was the people-watching which made the time go by more quickly.  We split two burgers and got zucchini fries and regular fries.  The burgers were delicious and so were the zucchini fries.  Our only issue was with their regular fries.  They had a stale and old taste to them.  They were flimsy and appeared overcooked.  My guess is we got the bottom of the fryer, because the people around us had a better looking batch of fries.  We told our waiter, how brought the manager over and he looked at and grabbed a fry.  He agreed that these were not up to their standard and he offered to replace them.  We declined since we were pretty much done with our meal, so he took the charge off our bill.

Overall, this place has great burgers and a great atmosphere with friendly and attentive staff,  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Zin Burger has some pretty good burgers, but not as good as Delux.
I have had the Zin Burger and the Turkey Burger. The Zin burger is good but nothing out of this world. i would recommend if you want a good burger. The turkey burger on the other hand is VERY good. One of the best turkey burgers I've ever had. The only turkey burger I've had that was better is at the Yard House. Overall, Zin Burger is good and worth checkin out."}
{"text":"So the burgers are good, as most people on Yelp have posted, but the experience could be better for a number of reasons.  We had the $20 dinner \"special\" for 2 - where you get 2 burgers, 1 order of fries for $20.  So when I got the bill, I was charged $21.25, and not $20 (this is not including tax), so I was thinking \"wait the special is advertised for $20, NOT $21.25!  

The server informed me that I was charged an \"extra\" $1.25 because I asked for onions on my burger! WTH!??  Are you serious??  The server never said that I would be charged extra for onions - so be careful when you order here, because Zin likes to add deceptive charges - what a Sin Zin!  Shysters.

I reluctantly give 3 stars because the burger was good and the service was also pretty good.  But Zin should include some food on the side with their burgers, because when you order a burger you are getting it stand-alone, no fries, no veggies, nutin.

If you want to add \"extra\" on your burger, be careful."}
{"text":"I've never been to a place so caring before. \"Would you like your fries out first?\" Who even asks that in this day and age. Huge shoutout to ZinBurger for caring for the human being. Not the democrat, not the republican, not the gay, not the straight, not the male not the female. Thank you for your genuine effort to make people happy. And for the record, Sammy is the best bartender/waitress around"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite burger place in Arizona. It reminds me of Umami Burger in California a lot... But little differences here and there. Zinburger has a much more extensive menu for sure though.

I love the Blanco Burger and the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Their Double Truffle Fries are also a-ma-zing. This particular location is just the one I went to last time but I've been to others around the valley and all of them have consistently good service. Waiters are always on point!"}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 star experience...wine and burgers? What could be better? Not much.  They have a great wine selection and the food was exceptional.  I went with the turkey sloppy joe, which was so much better than I could've imagined.  The hubby went with the turkey burger and my son went with the Zinburger.  Both said they were the best they'd ever had.  Needless to say, if we're in a burger mood, we'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:30pm and were told that it would be a 2 hour wait for a group our size (8). Mind you, there was maybe 3 groups ahead of us, and lots of empty tables on a Saturday Night. We stayed because we were not really believing it would take two hours, but they weren't kidding, so we stood at the bar (limited seating) and ordered drinks. The very first two drinks we ordered were two martinis. We watched as the bar tender poured the martini into the glass and it filled the (regular sized) martini glass leaving an inch to the top. We both laughed and said \"maybe this will be half priced?\" just kidding around as we thought he was making more to fill the glass to a normal level. He was preparing the second martini and it was only a little over half full too. Then he slid her the bill for $25.00. My friend was nice, so I made a comment and told the bartender that two half full martini's for $25.00 was ridiculous. They use the small side of a jigger and they don't even fill it up to the top. Knowing this, I ordered a double Mohito which cost me $14.00. The double tasted like a single shot.

I read all the poor reviews prior to going, however, I wanted to experience the restaurant for myself. When we finally were seated, we sat for no less then 10 minutes for our waitress. That's not to terribly long. However, once she took our drink orders, we didn't see again for about 20 minutes. Absolutely no where in site. She finally showed up at the table that was seated next to us and got their drink order yet had no drinks for us. When she turned around to get the other tables drink order, she walked quickly past me until I yelled \"excuse me\" to her. I then said we haven't seen our drinks and we have all been ready to order for a while now. She seemed surprised that I was a little frustrated so therefore, took our order. We waited a normal amount of time for our food and the apps came out (they were good) and the food came immediately after. We were all shocked! ALL OF OUR BURGERS WERE RED INSIDE!! Roughly 6 burgers were under cooked. We were all laughing as all of our burgers were impossible to eat and slowly fell apart where we had to use our forks. Some like them rare, some of us didn't but were to hungry to complain after waiting 2-3 hours to eat. Loved the loaded fries. The jalapeno fries were to hot to eat, the zucchini fries were OK. Somewhat mooshy. The manager walked around without acknowledging anyone. Seemed extremely unhappy. After we received our food the waitress disappeared never to ask any of us if we wanted another beverage (alcohol or non). All of our glasses sat empty, drinking the melted ice. The waitress finally came back near to closing time (10pm) with our checks. I was very disappointed. We should have went to Oregono's."}
{"text":"Burgers are great.  I especially enjoyed the Ringer with Frank's hot sauce, bacon, and onion rings.  The fries are good and large enough to share.  The milkshake we had was too thick.  It was a bit like trying to sip a golf ball through a straw.  Prices are steep for a burger and fries but the food is top quality.  If you know you're having a burger, might as well make sure it's awesome.  

The bar has a few really good beers on tap and a decent happy hour.  I'd find myself here for lunch quite a bit if I worked nearby.  Luckily (for my pants), I do not."}
{"text":"Service is spotty. There were no less than 4 employees at the front of the restaurant at all times, yet nobody checking on tables, cleaning dirty tables or really anything but chatting . Food was disappointing. Very bland. Also I don't know how I feel about staring at a mural of cows in a pasture grazing as I'm eating a hamburger. Also they take themselves a little too serious in the pricing."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. The waiter was very charismatic, very prompt on our needs. Matt was very friendly and customer service was great. Highly recommend, ask for Matt."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here! Taylor was an awesome waiter and was really helpful in helping us decide what to get. We couldn't decide between sweet potato fries and truffle fries. He recommended we should get \"Sweet Potato Truffle Fries\" and I'm so glad we did. I will come back just for those fries and the awesome service. The burgers, beer and cocktails were amazing as well."}
{"text":"Don't imagine we'll come back.  A $12.00 (a la carte) burger needs to be outstanding in every respect:  service, and correct prep, to writing an accurate check.  
It was lunch on Monday (moderately busy). We were seated immediately and greeted by our server with what felt like a perfunctory, obligatory, and robotic welcome (I get a better feeling when the guy at Cirlce K yells \"hello\" when I walk in). 
The ambiance (music) is loud. Too loud for me and Mom; but it's an opinion thing.  I can't really hold this against their star rating.  I kinda knew what to expect walking into a place called \"Zinburger\". 
Two soft drinks were served up quickly - - and we didn't have to ask for refills - - nice. 
The onion rings were ordered \"crispy\" and that's exactly how they arrived - - perfect so far. Mom commented that she liked them. 
Onto the  pièces de résistance: the \"Plain & Simple\" burger at $9.50 ordered well done (just like it sounds with lettuce, tomato, and hold the mayo) and the \"Samburger\" at $12.00 ordered medium well (a bacon cheeseburger with 1000 Island added in the kitchen). 
P&S was as ordered, but we unfortunately had to ask to have the Sam returned to either drain the blood or cook it to order. 
The Sam was oozing red throughout. No biggie. Please (once I get your attention - which was no small feat) just whip me up another - - and make it \"well done\" to be on the safe side. Our server agreed - -that beef patty wasn't cooked - - and marched right back in to the kitchen to fetch me another. 
But whatever happened behind those swinging doors as she went out of sight wasn't what SHOULD have happened, because it took until Mom had finished eating (think slow 70 year old working her way through a monster burger) before I saw food again. 
The second Sam was cooked correctly (but the bun was cold - go figure), but I have no idea what could have taken it so very, very long.  Actually I do.  What probably occurred is that our server (perhaps after waiting for and getting a manager's \"approval\") entered a new order for a Samburger cooked well done.  In other words - my re-order was probably started from scratch.  
What should have happened is that the very next burger coming off the line should have been mine.  It's a burger place.  I'd bet there was a production line of burgers already sizzling away back there - - - but no one with the customer service awareness to say, \"Hey  - - make the next one off well done, and send it to the old chubby guy's table.\"
Whatever. 
To add insult to injury, I got the check, added a 20% tip (I'm a softie), and got up to leave...
....when I realized, \"WAIT!  Why was my check more than 50 bucks?\". 
My server found the problem on the itemized check: I'd been charged for three burgers (a P&S and 2 Sams).  She said she'd be \"right back\" after getting a manager to fix the check. 
What should have taken about 90 seconds to fix, stretched into at least five minutes.  I chalk it up to more sub-standard service behind the scenes. 
The corrected check came back with a comped Sam.... the first sign that there might be hope for the place. 
BTW - The Samburger tasted just fine. Perhaps even $12.00 fine if everything else had fallen into place."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Great bloody marys!"}
{"text":"It's a burger. Nothing \"all that special\" here in my opinion. And the menu is very spare (everyone in the party best be looking for a burger)."}
{"text":"Firkin awesome food.  Worth letting your belt loose for.  Salads were just as good as the burger."}
{"text":"A long wait for a table (admittedly for six peeps) for decent, but over-priced burger with mediocre buns. Really loud because of loads of screaming, obnoxious children. OK service."}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience here tonight starting with great service from Cali. Onion rings were the bomb, fries were great. Two different flavors of milkshake shared at the table, both were great. Hamburgers were all awesome and cooked as ordered. Banana pie very good as well."}
{"text":"A very good take on what we can call the \"corporate hipster\" eatery.  Not pretentious, but definitely trying to push the boundaries of basic burgers - and not just with manbuns.  \"Grass Fed\" beef available for a $5 push.  We had the Wedge salad, green chili fries, Diablo burger, and the Ring burger (all to share and taste test).

The Wedge salad is a nice take on the steakhouse staple, but the \"wedge\" is actually chopped iceberg.  It's the subtle, tangy dressing, applewood smoked bacon, and excellent blue cheese that make it a delight.

The fries were OK; a very personal food item that for me are too \"string\" like (I prefer more substantial fries).  The green chilis were sufficient (but not ample), and the cheese/cream sauce did bind it all together nicely.

The burgers were very good; crisp, sweet onion rings on the Ring Burger topped with thick, crispy upscale bacon.  MMM.  The Diablo's attraction are the peppers and chipotle mayo.  Hot and tangy and amazing contrast to the cheese.  Thick patties.  Manly buns lol.  You may want to ask for any mayo or \"sauce' to be on the side as it can be a touch overwhelming.

I wold not run towards these corporate hipsters, but if I were in the area looking for an amazing burger, I would certainly join them and their manbuns."}
{"text":"First time me and my lady have been to zin burger and dang was it amazing! I gorged a delicious RINGER BURGER and she enjoyed a PLAIN AND SIMPLE with jalapeño. We also had some really good zucchini fries and we must say definitely worth $10 a burger. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place we went and got burgers to take home!
Both burgers were amazing! 
The few things I am not crazy about would be there isn't a hostess stand! Seems like they had 5 - 6 employees with iPads that are supposed to check people in! 
The two entrances and employees turning there backs to customers when they come in causes a bit of confusion!

The food is great reasonably priced!
The attire is casual and besides the multiple hostess standing around doing barely anything it's seems like a good place ! 
We will have to sit down next time so I can give a better more informative review!

One final issue is with the bar staff the day I picked up the food they told us 15 min wait! 
I got there a little early so I waited by the bar! I had to ask multiple times if my food was ready! 
The last time I asked I spoke with a gentlemen who seemed to be the bar manager! Instead of him going and checking on the order he asked the female bartender to do so! 
Seems like he wasn't that interested about checking on my food. I even tipped the bartender when I paid but I regret doing so because it wasn't deserved! The gentlemen I asked should have walked around to the kitchen to check for me instead of passing it on  to the one bartender whom seemed over whelmed with the tiny bar area! 
So since it really wasn't good customer service from this point I am only giving 3 stars! Because the food was good! Hopefully next time we eat and sit their we will have a better experience!"}
{"text":"Restaurants seem to have struck gold in capitalizing on the modern-day desires of burger lovers that stress the importance of quality over price. Especially when it comes to dropping an extra five dollar premium to upgrade your burger to \"grass-fed\" status - quite possibly the biggest scam since that creepy telemarketing dude kept promising me that I could make ten grand a month by working from home.

Interestingly enough, higher quality burgers have quietly existed on menus at restaurants for many years, especially steakhouses. But it wasn't until the last decade that people realized that these burgers could easily be marketed more prominently. And it seems that they all opened up at exactly the same damned time. Zinburger is no different. 

After a handful of visits, we've had the Samburger, Zinburger, and Breakfast. By the standards of fast food? Sure, it's in a whole other league.  But in comparison to all of the other cookie-cutter premium burger joints in this area? Not even close. I feel burgers at places like Ingo and Hopdoddy are superior in taste, although I'm still not entirely sure why.

We've also tried double truffle fries, zucchini fries, and a \"loaded\" variation. All the fries are decent, although not to the point where I'd rank them over some other places I've visited.

Our favorite shake is the Nutella Hazelnut Crunch, while making the oh so controversial decision to modify it with a banana for a dollar extra. I really like that they let you split the shakes, serving them in separate glasses.  

I sort of roll my eyes at all of these Fox concepts, because they can essentially open whatever type of restaurant they want, in whatever area they want, with the funds to make it look however they want. Although I will always find more appreciation in individually owned burger places built from the ground up, there isn't really anything particularly offensive about their food. And while I'd recommend Zinburger for an occasional visit, I'd also recommend the 50 other burger places in Phoenix that pretty much use an identical approach - just not quite as heavy on the whole \"hip corporate\" vibe.

It's nothing innovating, but it works for the \"concept\" that it is, I guess."}
{"text":"All of Fox restaurants are legit, and Zinburger is no different. Delish ISH! Love the Breakfast burger w/ a fried egg on it. I get it lettuce wrapped, no mayo to keep it fairly Paleo. Sweet Potato fries are bomb and don't need the aoli they come with if you wanna keep the calories down."}
{"text":"It's a great burger...The stuff isn't cheap, but it's really tasty. 

There are a variety of options, tons of toppings and options, a veggie burger (if you're into that sort of thing), and a bunch of different types of fries.

I've been twice, I had the Kobe burger once (not worth the extra $, because the regular burgers are so good on their own), and the Samburger last time I was there. Both burgers were really good, but I thought the fries were a little underwhelming. 

The best part of the menu to me is their milkshakes. Awesome milkshakes. Keep in mind though, you'll be taking out a second mortgage to buy a burger, fries and milkshake (no joke those three things will run you $25 + tax/tip). Only other real negative is that there always seems to be a wait. It's not that big inside, and I don't want to sit outside when it's 100+.

There are a couple spots that I think have better burgers, but Zin is a very, very good option in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A beautiful day to have a burger outside on a patio so we chose zinburger. Got seated after a 20 minute wait but it was worth it. The zucchini fries were amazing, love the green tea (has a vanilla background flavor), and all of our burgers were delicious! The strawberry lemonade has a bit of a sour bite to it for my taste, but my granddaughter was totally enamored. I probably would never want to eat inside as it is a bit crowded and loud."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a feast when we came to Zinburger. They have a solid menu of burgers to choose from, and their shakes are delicious! 

We ordered the zucchini fries that came with ranch and parmesan, and I really enjoyed them. They were perfectly crispy on the outside, but soft and juicy on the inside. We also had the diablo burgers, which were definitely spicy, but the jalapeños added a nice flavor to the burgers. The buns were fluffy and sweet, but very filling (I only ate the bottom bun).

For dessert, we had the cookies and cream shake. You can never go wrong with oreo milkshakes, and this one was no exception! They had crunchy oreos blended into the ice cream, and light whipped cream on top -- YUM! 

Overall, Zinburger is a great place to grab a burger and shake and people watch in the Biltmore! (Keep in mind, the dress code is nice casual! My friend and I came here in workout clothes after a hike, and were pretty underdressed. Ooops!)"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go, but I honestly think you can find a better burger at several other restaurants.  In my opinion, the pickled onions and cheese make the burgers a little too sweet.  Everything else is very good, though.  Fun place to take the family and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I rarely eat burgers, but when I do I love them to be nice and juicy and full of flavor... And that is exactly what I got a Zinburger. I went and built my own creation, added some American cheese, bacon, and a fried egg and got a side of onion rings and their bacon bloody mary to round out my god knows how many heart clogging calories lunch.

Burger was pretty dang good, and the onion rings were maybe some of the best I've ever had. Their bloody mary was a-ok, not the best I've ever had but a solid effort on their end. Where they had a serious misstep was with their service, our waitress was a total space cadet and just dropped the ball over and over again. Prices were a little steep for what they are serving, after my couple of additions to my BYO burger it was pushing nearly $14.00, add in another $6.00 for a super small portion of onion rings and $12.00 for the worlds smallest bloody mary it ended up be a super pricey $33.00 for my lunch. 

The steep prices and service are what brought my rating down from a 4 to a 3. Solid if your cool with spending a fair amount of cash on a simple burger."}
{"text":"By far the best burgers around . So juicy and flavorful. Love that they are so customizable too. Great service. Highly suggest"}
{"text":"For all you low carb lifestyle folks not only can you get a bunless burger it's actually a choice on the menu! No weird looks when going bunless at zinburger! They serve it ON a few peices of lettuce. You can make a wrap out of it or just fork and knife it as is.  

I got the Kobe and added bacon. It was the JUCIEST BURGER EVER!! I know...how can it be worth almost 50% more $$? Well, it was my 1st time here. I'll try the regular one and see the difference next time. The cheese and mushrooms were amazing. 

I had gourmet burgers all over Scottsdale and so far this is the best I have had.  I ordered water and it was really good. No taste at all, a lot of places have lousy water."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and every time I come away with the same thought, \"The service, atmosphere and location were all top notch but it was the food that failed.\"

Everything about this restaurant is on par with many other places except the food and in the end that's why people come back again. I personally won't be going back any time soon. There are many other better burger places in the Valley that are much cheaper. If Zinburger can improve their menu, I'll give it another chance. If you're looking for good food at Old Town Gilbert there are many better options."}
{"text":"We called ahead on St. Patties day for a 5:00 seating. We were seated quickly but waited about ten minutes before server greeted us. Good came pretty quick, crispy and tasty fries. We each upgraded to the Kobe beef that was really good but I don't think I could tell the difference from regular beef so probably not worth the 5.00 charge. $54.00 for two of us but over all pretty good."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty laid back. The patio looks out to camelback road and faces south so it's a pretty urban feel. Because it was 103, we sat inside.
Kira served us for happy hour which included half-priced sides and draft beers...perfect. The burger I got was called the slam burger...bacon cheeseburger with 1000 island. It came out in less than 10 minutes in a fairly busy restaurant and Kira served everything with a smile and great attitude. 
I could see it being kind of pricy off of happy hour but it's really worth a little extra to have to ambience and high-quality burger. Lastly, upgrade to the Kobe beef...you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Love it! Service and food were perfect! The Kobe burgers are excellent, love the salads and the shakes. The hostess was very helpful with seating options, it was nice to sit outside before the weather gets too hot!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had the Breakfast Burger & it was fantastic! The patty was tender, juicy & delicious and the toppings were fresh & flavorful. The service was fantastic; helpful & prompt! The hand-cut fries were great, too! We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I gave this particular location two chances. The burgers are bland. the braised onions had no flavor. That's about it. If you wanta good burger, go to Flancers down the street. I will never go to Zinbuger again."}
{"text":"My picks:
Bananas Foster Shake
Sweet Potato Fries (but the zucchini fries were a close second)
Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (if you don't eat red meat)
Banana Crème Pie

This is THE place in town to go for a burger and a shake.  Too bad I its so much food that you can possibly eat all 4 of my favorites in one meal.

Bonus points for Sam Fox opening the restaurant to the Phoenix Children's Hospital special guests prior to the general public."}
{"text":"Tried the plain old burger, which comes with lettuce, tomato, mayo,  and added havarti cheese. Ordered it medium -well. It was really great. I'm not a big burger fan, mostly because I've never found a great burger. This was a tender, well cooked burger. Really happy with my choice and will order it again. Liked the zucchini fries, too, though a little on the thin and limp-side for my liking. Not greasy, but definitely could be improved upon."}
{"text":"I had the Kobe Burger, it was great! juicy and flavorful. Went there with my daughter at a spur of the moment, service was a little slow at times but it was a good  experience and will return to start trying the rest of the menu. definitely try the zucchini fries they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Nom nomnom. This food was LITTTT AF. 

Burger lovers rejoice. Nommy burgers and a great atmosphere. 

We made reservations which was nice so we didn't have to wait for a table with our kids. They had etch a sketches for the kids to draw on which was cool. 

I got the happy hour specials. I got 2 sliders , the jalapeño popper and the buttermilk chicken slider. The jalapeño popper was delish. Probably my favorite out of the 2. The buttermilk chicken slider had quality chicken and also was good. I like spicy food while is why I preferred the jalapeño popper. I could have probably just ordered 1 because their sliders are bigger than your average slider.

We also got the zucchini fries! They were da bomb.com. They were nice and crispy not soggy at all. There was plenty to share.

If you are looking for a gourmet burger place with reasonable prices this place is your place. Hit up Hapoy hour for even better prices."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food! We usually go because of the milkshakes and fries. Burgers are decent."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Really great date restaurant, but, they also are really great about to-go orders as well. 

Awesome menu, and an equally great drink menu as well. They have a daily special that rotates, but can be applied to different burger types as well (I don't eat beef, so I always get the turkey burger). They can also assure that the fries are cooked separately if you're a gluten-free kid like me. 

For sure try to the sweet potato fries, I think they're better here than at Delux. I also love the cucumber dipping sauce that goes along with it. 

It can get pretty busy on a weekend night, so be prepared to wait like 20 minutes. They also have a great bar area, and an outside seating area that has heaters in the winter."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Amazing burger (\"plain and simple\") and the Salted Caramel Milkshake was INSANE!"}
{"text":"Just too pricey. Nothing over the top to justify paying a la carte. Won't go back I have bills to pay."}
{"text":"Went with a friend, we got the blue cheese burger (she loved it!little strong in blue cheese flavor me), the Greek burger(so good!!), loaded fries (good!), green tea (good), and their zingeria (super good!!) The atmosphere is open and fresh! We had a great dinner and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went to go try zinburger on a Sunday just before noon.
We thought we would have no trouble getting in as there was about a 1/4 of the tables open. We were told that there was a 45 min wait. As a business owner this is unacceptable. That usually means bad managment. So we went to another restaurant that had 3 or 4 tables open and got right in. It may have good food but we will never know."}
{"text":"For the price I was really expecting better. The bun on my burger was soggy and the meat was just ok. I had the salted caramel shake which was really good. The zucchini fries were good but greasy. If I were to come back I would just get the shake."}
{"text":"This is our favorite burger place in Scottsdale. Usually busy but great staff that always makes you feel welcome and wait staff very friendly and professional. A joy to take the family out for a burger and fries. Especially nice job by our waiter Devon, he was very busy but never forgot a single request and took care of us like we were his only table! Obviously this location is well managed as our experience is consistently great."}
{"text":"I've heard and heard about this place and I finally went.  It's okay.  Not awful at all, but not my favorite burger joint and I've other places I prefer for a burger.  They do have a great patio that overlooks the Biltmore, which always provides good people watching.

First, our food came out in weird order.  I split a Chinese chicken salad with someone and we also decided to split the zuchinni fries as well. We each ordered a burger, however the fries came out first, then the salad, then the burgers. Odd.  Who doesn't serve fries with a burger.

The chicken salad was pretty blah.  NOt a lot of flavor at all.  I didn't taste any hint of sesame, the base of Chinese anything, and it was a bit watery.

The zucchini fries were fantastic.  great crunch, not soggy at all, hot when served.

The burgers:  I ordered the Zinburger, the original.  It was fine, but nothing to write home about. I think for me it was the onions that threw me off. I love onions of all forms.  These were made in wine and I just didn't care for it, plus my burger needed some seasoning.  I did like the addition of the manchengo cheese. Yum.  The burger was cooked perfectly.

My friend got the turkey burger and I liked it better. I had more flavor to it by far. Interesting.  

Our server was attention and engaging. Would I go back and pay $10 and up for a burger?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm generally a big Fox Restaurant fan. I was excited to try Zinburger and finally got there with some friends. I split a turkery burger, sweet potato fries and the chocolate mint milkshake with a friend. 

Let's start with my favorite part of the meal - the milkshake! It was amazing and delicious and I'd certainly order this again (probably one for just me though!). 

My next favorite dish were the fries - perfectly done with the right amount of crunch and softness. They come with a yogurt dipping sauce - it's fine but completely unnecessary. 

Sadly, my least favorite part of the meal was the turkey burger. It was boring! It had no flavor except for the avocado on top. Where were all the great seasonings?! 

I'll try this place again, but would hope for more in the burgers when it's in the name."}
{"text":"Well my dining experience started off on the wrong foot.

I was seated within a few minutes and then I sat there for a long time contemplating if I should just leave since no one was waiting on me. Yes I'm very impatient if you read my reviews but at the 12 minute mark if I don't know who my server is I'm ready to leave.

My waitress came over and grabbed my order finally.

My sweet potato fries came out and then a manager came over to apologize which really caught me off guard. I didn't complain I was just reading the news on my phone.

She explained the hostess made a mistake and there was a miscommunication on who was to wait on me.

She then told me my fries were on the house so that made them even sweeter.

Burger was outstanding when they say they are putting Franks red hot on the burger they don't lie. 

After my meal I asked if I could get a Strawberry shake to go and then they comped that because they felt so bad about me having to wait.

Again I didn't complain not one single word so I was extremely impressed they recognized their error and wanted to fix it.

This was my second time dining at a Zine Burger and I hope to make it back to Arizona to dine here again.

The food is very high quality and they definitely care about the customer experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Sitting outdoors in the Biltmore area is a great atmosphere, service was fantastic, and food was spectacular. I had a burger and truffle fries. The truffle fries are a must to try for everyone! It's pricier than somewhere like Applebee's but lower than other fox restaurants. Burgers do not come with a side, but they have several options of fries and appetizers."}
{"text":"Zinburger is so good!! My favorite item is the veggie burger. It's super fresh and delicious! Most veggie burgers taste dry or have a lot of black bean, and this one is super unique. I also love their sides - I usually swap between the regular fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini fries. I have heard great things about the milkshakes but haven't tried them yet. Highly recommend this burger spot!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to write a quick review to highlight the non-beef side of Zinburger! I'm not a vegetarian but I seriously do crave that veggie burger - it is so fresh and delicious! It is not dry at all and the avocado just makes it. My dad is a huge fan of turkey burgers and said that he really enjoyed his as well (both pictured). We also ordered the zucchini fries - really yummy and a huge portion! Just wanted to recommend this place even to those looking for a lighter and/or non-red-meat meal. Unless you cave with a milkshake, of course. :P"}
{"text":"First time to this place.... Now I may be tough due to the fact that I am in restaurant business for over 17 yrs..
Service on a scale of 1 to 10 .. 10 being top score they score 4
Food 8
Price score 5 very expensive when you add your sides and so on( at high tide seafood bar and grill ) surf and turf lobster / burger with sides and cheese $14.. Here just cheese burger and fries is $17.
 Kale salad very odd.. Waiter never refill water... Lack of consistency ... Not friendly ... Hostess were good.. Managers walking around and never check tables .. A dirty table with dirty dishes sitting next to us for about 12 mins and almost 7 staff walk by and look at the dirty table and walk to the kitchen barehanded .. Finally hostess started to clean it... Would I go back.. Probably not.. Overall they score low with me..."}
{"text":"Let me start that I did \"call ahead\" on a Sunday for 5:45 but when we arrived we were told our table had been given away because we were a no show? It was 5:40. But they would get us table outside asap. We were seated 25 mins later. Unfortunately a server did not come to our table for 15 minutes after being seated! When she did come over she was very nice and took out drink and app order. Drinks came fast and so did the zucchini fries. But they were soggy! Ugh so disappointed! Shortly after the server took our food order and food came out fast! All of our burgers were pretty good! But the server never came back so out drinks were empty for a long time. Needless to say I was disappointed! Food was pretty good but service was bad! When I drive out there again I will go to Postinos or Liberty Market before I visit Zinburger again!"}
{"text":"DROOOOL! Zinburger is amazing. I love this place so much now and the location is perfect. I've always had very nice servers that are super attentive. Everything I have tried here has been incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"If I could marry Zinburger I would. It is so so so good. I've loved everything I've gotten there. Good service every time."}
{"text":"Best burger ever! My waitress Katie was very attentive and friendly! I had the Samburger with wine braised onions, that was cooked to perfection! SOOoooo damn good! when in Phoenix, Az and your craving a big fat juicy burger, Zinburger is  MUST!"}
{"text":"I am no match for the breakfast burger, zucchini fries, and latte milkshake. The burgers are always cooked to order and I love their little patio area overlooking the splash pad. Or yoga space, if you come right when they open at 11am on Sunday while Lululemon is hosting their weekly free yoga class outside. I wonder if the smell of my bacon affected their yoga-ing?"}
{"text":"First time to Zinburger. There was a 30 minute wait for a table, but luckily there was room at th bar to wait. We had drinks at the bar. Luckily, we weren't starving and were meeting friends and looking forward to chatting before our meal.

I had the Signature Zinburger. That burger was so juicy, it damn near melted in my mouth! The flavor combo of this burger is amazing. The double truffle fries are crispy, truffly perfection. 

For being as busy as it was, service was great, and timing of food and drinks was great. Four stars because the size of the fries basket is pretty small, considering the price of $6 a basket."}
{"text":"Not super impressed.  Went there for a birthday celebration. We ordered drinks and one came...while we waited on the others.  They came to take our order and still no drinks. I told the server we wanted drinks before we order. I was making more of statement than anything.  She finally came back with drinks...but forgot someone's shake.  Anyway...we ordered appetizers and this was disappointing too. Onion rings were basically super fried batter...and oh yeah...an onion was in there somewhere. Truffle fries were good though. But...still no shake.

We all got different burgers. I got the blue cheese burger...medium.  It showed up and was about 10 seconds from being well done.  Not close to medium at all. Someone else had the same problem and there was no pink in the middle of her burger anywhere. Totally well done. Still no shake for the birthday boy.

Finally, the server said she would comp the shake and the burger. She did replace the well done burger and it came back....eh....medium+. Still not really medium.  Oh..the shake showed up.

The check came...still had the shake on it. We pointed that out and they took it off.

The server was extraordinarily polite and so was the manager. I mean just over the top polite. The kind that comes across not very genuine.

I just wasn't floored by Fox's attempt at a burger place. I didn't dislike it, but I expected a lot.  There's too much competition in this space to have a so-so burger place."}
{"text":"gotta love the buns, but lack of sweet and sour burgers"}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  Unfortunately I wasn't hungry enough to try a burger.  But I had a delightfully delicious chopped salad.  My kids had a yummy looking kids meal.  The ambiance is fun-we sat in a booth.  Then we went outside and splashed around in the fountains.  Love scottsdale quarter.  I look forward to returning and trying a burger."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and sat at the bar as it was fairly empty. I've been here before but failed to write anything for whatever reason. 

I really like how open the feeling is when you're at the bar. That's probably because the sliding window is still up since the weather is nice. 

The turkey burger I had was delicious with lettuce and cheese (I added jalapeños for a kick) and mayo. For my side, I ordered the half & half fries...yummy!  I like that their ranch isn't a traditional ranch. Drink wise the Hop Shoch IPA had a kick while the pomegranate mule was refreshing & light. 

Even better was the service. Alex was my bartender & he kicked ass. He was friendly without being fake & handled business well as it got significantly busier throughout my meal. 

Sam Fox, I've said it before and I'll say it again; I doubt you could develop a restaurant I don't like."}
{"text":"Waited forever to be seated while the hostesses were working on arranging takes for a party of 16, which never even showed up the whole time I was there.   literally had to ask three different people to be seated.  help the customers standing in front of you before you  worry about a reservation that is an hour later."}
{"text":"Think Fox is trying to put Delux into the ground...good burger (turkey) messy but not something I would seek out on a regular basis....went their for lunch but will need to give it a shot for dinner...2 stars are like most prople's 3....not a bad experience but think like most Phoenicians...we are drawn to new places to dine and if Fox does it (which he does it right) we are going to go....worth the \"been there done that\"  but thats it."}
{"text":"Another place I really wanted to like. Like Joel L. says below me, this is absolutely a style over substance place. Took my Dad and boss there over the weekend to catch up, have a burger and a milkshake, and hopefully impress my dad who is the milkshake nazi if one has ever existed.

We got an order of the Zucchini Fries to start which were actually very delicious. I was pleased with the quality of the zucchini as well as the consistency. They were not overly breaded and fried and therefore soggy, they were just right. I got their version of a Mint Chocolate Chip milkshake which was delicious but so sweet I got a stomach ache about 5 minutes into drinking it which was kind of a bummer. Our waiter overheard my Dad giving his milkshake diatribe which basically consists of \"Young people don't know how to make a milkshake anymore blah blah blah\" so poor thing bless his heart tried as hard as he could to take all of my father's demands into account on this simple chocolate shake and just failed miserably. In the business of full disclosure, he never had a chance so I cannot hold that against them.

Things took a turn for the worst when we got to the burgers. My Dad and I each ordered the Zinburger, his cooked Medium and mine cooked Medium Well. His came out Medium Well and mine Well Done. The beef wasn't terribly flavorful in my opinion. The manchego cheese and other toppings were nice, but the real issue for me lies with the buns. By the time the burgers got to our table, the buns were already so soggy that you couldn't even pick up the burger without the whole thing falling apart! Serious issue as all burger eaters out there know. We each ended up trying to knife and fork it which wasn't terribly successful either.

All in all I find Zinburger to be just average. Didn't hate it, but certainly didn't love it. I must go out of my way however to say how exemplary our service was there. Our waiter was fantastic and took excellent care of us.

However when the hunkering for a $10 burger hits me, you will continue to find me at Delux or Houston's..."}
{"text":"I own a dog. My husband has even taken it to a restaurant or there is a patio set up for a dog. They do not belong at the counter, sitting on the seat that the next customer will sit in. Where is the manager? Won't eat here again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out and I was slightly underwhelmed. The food was good. Nothing too special. I had the Ringer burger and for as much as was going on in it the taste was relatively bland. Also had the truffle fries which were ok. The best part of the dinner was our server. She was AMAZING. super sweet and spot on with refills and such. Wouldnt be opposed to going back but it def would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Only because I know the food is good that I give it 2 stars, but otherwise the service is absolutely horrendous.  I won't be coming back, cause the food isn't good enough to excuse the poor service"}
{"text":"I finally made a long awaited return trip to Zinburger and it was as good as I remembered it! Just the smell walking into the place was enough to let me know I made the right decision to eat there. 

My girlfriend and I split a Zinburger (if you're going to name a signature menu item after yourself, it better be good), a chicken sandwich, and an order of the double truffle fries. I absolutely loved the fries. I'm not even that big on fries, but I could have had another order just for myself! The Aioli dipping sauce was amazing. Ketchup would've been an insult to put on them. The server also aware when we ordered that we were going to split the meals, so they halfed the sandwiches, and put them both on each plate. A nice little touch. Both were phenomenal. My girlfriend rarely eats red meat and she enjoyed indulging in her half of the burger. We also split a creme brulee shake for desert. Just as good as it was the first time. 

It was nearly 8:30 and we were seated promptly. A little corner table on the patio with the bar. It was a nice spot, but it got a little annoying because it was right by one of the main entrances of the mall's parking lot. Even that late, it was still a little distracting everything I heard a car making a turn just feet from our table. But the food at Zinburger remains top notch."}
{"text":"First time and had the chuck Norris burger of the week. It was amazing food is great staff is super nice with great service. I would definitely come back to see what a the next burger of the week is.

Recommend:

Green chili fries"}
{"text":"Yum! I am on a quest for the best Phoenix veggie burger and my burger here is on the top of the list so far. You can add just about anything to your burger (and any of the themed burgers on the menus can be swapped for a veg patty) and they have a big variety of fries to choose from too. I got the sweet potato fries with dinner and they were great, especially dipped in the yogurt sauce they come with. 

Service here is phenomenal - really friendly hostesses and bar staff. I loved the indoor/outdoor bar and they turn the heaters on at night if you want to sit outside even when it's a little chilly. 

Only downside - this place is a little pricey. For a beer, fries, and burger my total was about $25 before tip. It's not your average cheap burger joint, it's defiantly a fancy deluxe restaurant with a casual vibe. Just go close to pay day."}
{"text":"We had an ahi burger - zero taste compared to other local Ahi Burgers, server never heard of wasabi mayo and they did not carry.  Also had the Kobe burger- nothing special to pay 15-20 on.  I'm all for paying extra but if the food doesn't deliver, well then-"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! I had burger with grilled onions, blue cheese and A 1 sauce.!perfect!Excellent customer service at the bar. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went here on a recent date night before meeting some friends in Scottsdale for some bowling.  We arrived around 5:30 and were able to be seating on the patio quickly (luckily it wasn't too hot yet).  Our server was with us quickly, and was pleasant/helpful/friendly the hole time.  

For starters, we got the truffle fries which were good.  Nice and warm and crispy, and I liked the little dipping sauce that came with them.  For my burger, they had a special of the day which was a turkey burger with avocado/swiss.  I liked the sounds of the topping, but not so much of the turkey burger, and it was no problem for me to get the 'special burger toppings' on the beef burger.  To wash down my burger, I ordered the Creme Brulee milkshake.

The burger came out and was very good...I would definitely go there again for a high-quality burger.  The milkshake, it wasn't great, definitely good, but not great.  There just wasn't a strong enough creme brulee flavor for me.  

The wife had some sort of veggie burger that she liked and a glass of wine that she also enjoyed.  We thought that the bill was reasonable.  We would definitely consider going back to Zinburger."}
{"text":"One of the top burger joints in the valley.  Trendy new location that is in a prime spot. I strongly recommend the Breakfast Burger...bacon, cheese, fried egg , and avocado...freakn amazing. Top it off with a Four Peaks Kiltlifter."}
{"text":"Mine and my families favorite place to get a burger and fries. We've celebrated at least 4 birthday this year there.  Happy hour is the best time to go. No wait and half off sides and beer/wine. The Zinburger and a chopped wedge is the way to go"}
{"text":"Cute place, unfortunately it is pretty small. Max occupancy is only 70 so you can quickly get into a 45 min wait time. The wait area is not separate from the eating area so unfortunately while we were trying to eat, people who were waiting and didn't have clear restaurant manner would stand with their backs practically right against our table talking loudly, even though in the wait area there was plenty of room for them to stand. I was disappointed that the 3 hostesses didn't ask people to move into the wait area away from the people dining. I almost asked the people myself to move away from our table. Having said that the staff was some of the friendliest I have ever encountered, very funny and interested in us and what had brought us out to them.

Onto the food! All in all it was mixed for me. We tried the loaded fries but for me they were lacking in flavor and were nothing very special. They weren't bad, just not something I would pay for again. One of my favorite things is Ahi tuna so I went for the seared ahi tuna burger. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. With the description of the burger with the cole slaw and the glaze I was expecting it to burst with flavor. Instead there was literally no flavor at all...zero. $14.50 and I only ate half of it. The tuna was also so tough that I couldn't bite through it and almost choked and got sick at the table because I couldn't get it down.
My daughter's burger is a different story. This was probably one of the best burgers I have ever had. She got the blanco burger, Pico, guac and pepper jack cheese with the Kobe beef and it was outstanding. It definitely had that punch of flavor I had been hoping for in my burger. My only negative was they use the sweet Hawaiian buns for their burgers and that just doesn't work in my opinion. The sweetness is too much and makes it taste like you have sugar sprinkled on your burger.  It wouldn't stop me from eating here again, I would just not order the tuna again and go for one of the more flavorful selections. The iced tea was excellent as well! Fresh brewed black or green tea was magnificent. You could tell it was super fresh and very crisp tasting.
All in all I would recommend this place, we will go back. The next time I will know what to avoid and will hopefully enjoy it more!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Got the Kobe burger medium and it was excellent and so were the hand cut fries... I would recommend this place to anyone. Environment is cool and 4 tv's can be seen all the way through the place so you don't miss the game.. One more time, YUMMM"}
{"text":"Easily best burger I've ever had. Ordered the Breakfast Burger. Juicy, tasty and fresh. The truffle fries are like crack - we couldn't stop eating them - so we got two orders. My husband had the Ringer, my brother had the Zinburger. All were delicious and perfect. Even my daughters kids meal was great!  

Service was also great. 

Will be back here on our next visit to AZ :)"}
{"text":"They have great shakes, I got the Banana Royale and was not disappointed. Great customer service, Matt was very friendly and attentive (oppose of Denny's)"}
{"text":"We have been here about 10 times since it opened and usually it ranks as one of the best burgers in town!  We love the Kobe burger medium rare with a side of zuc fries.  The burger has a home made bun that is delicious...mushrooms and cheddar.  It is well seasoned and juicy...I'm talking double napkin!  Also, they have a Buffalo Chix sandwich that is one of the best.  The Chicken is juicy yet crispy on the outside...it is spicy so you need the ranch!  They will serve things protein style which is nice.  If you have room get the Kit Kat shake...they will split it if need be!  I left a star off because we went today and it wasn't nearly as good so I hope it was only a fluke!"}
{"text":"Last year, when faced with a week of no solid foods before AND after renal surgery, Dude asked me what/where I wanted to eat the Saturday before.  

One place came to mind. Zinburger! 

When you've got a week of chicken broth, water, Jell-O and Morphine to look forward to: Who in their right mind would turn up their nose to gourmet burgers, decadent and creative milkshakes and craveable sides?!

Over the last year and a half, we've gone 4-5 times. Friendly customer service every visit, and worth the wait time.

We've tried the Double Truffle Fries with Garlic Aioli, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato and Zucchini fries ... All delicious; however, the Double Truffle Fries are the winner here.

You can replace any patty with Kobe Beef or Turkey; they will also lettuce wrap them for all you Paleonerds and Low Carb Kids. 

My favorites have been: 

1) Turkey Burger: These guys do it right. Not your typical Jenni-O boring patties. 
2) The Samburger: Cheese, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Thousand Island with the obligatory lettuce, tomato and onion. 

I'd drive 30 minutes out here JUST for that Creme Brulee Shake. 

Wish the Butterfinger one was a permanent menu option, not just another \"Shake of the Month\"! 

Highly recommend sharing them. They are huge. 

Hit up Zinburger to indulge any burger / \"sin food\" craving. And wear your fat pants. I know I'll be back ... Again and again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food! It was tasty. Reasonably priced. I liked the atmosphere and the patio. Great choiceZ it's kind of confusing when you first walk in. The hostess stand needs a new setup. Also, The hostess seemed aloof and unorganized. Other than that our waitress was bubbly and talkative. My husband and I mentioned that we will each get a burger and sample each other's. The waitress took it upon herself and had the sandwiches cut in half. She put one side of each burger or out plates - to avoid us having to do any of the work! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Zucchini fries and Zinburger were the bomb! They also have clean good quality water. Service was amazing and friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow. Talk about amazing. If you're in old towne Gilbert, or close, I dream about there food, drinks and service, which is acclimatising (I meant amazing but auto correct came up with that and I already used amazing and its sounds cool) like this place, which accommodated to my very picky gf and made her extremely happy, she created a yelp account just to write for them."}
{"text":"What can't I say about ZinBurger!? Everything is amazing lets start there. Zucchini fries, truffle fries, a few of my favorites. They feature a new burger (weekly?) that is always enticing! I love their beer selection on draft, and its ICE COLD! Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, makes the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"I've been here to Zinburger a few times but this is my first review. I have to say that it is probably my favorite burger restaurant in the state. I've been to most of the other popular and trendy places but Zin keeps on living up to the best!

On our latest visit we were seated in the heated patio. The wait for the restaurant was nearly 30 mins or seating right away on the patio. It was chilly out so I was happy for the heat lamps! Not bad at all with them on. 

My wife and I decided to share this time.   It was hard to do, but since its the new year, I wanted to start things right in my whole diet and exercise plan.  Cutting calories in half is a good start right?  We had the ringer with avocado added.  All I can say was wow. Excellent! In the past we have had the Kobe burger with pineapple which was a special back then, and we have ordered that numerous times.  It's been almost a year since I tried that one though. We also shared the truffle fries which were great. 

All in all, it was just the right amount of food for us. I would say this is our fifth time here and I never had a bad experience hence my 5 star review. I think the Ringer is my new all time favorite so I'm sure we will be back here soon for it again!!"}
{"text":"Keeping it simple, because I'm writing this on the fly... This was my first visit, I had the Diablo burger, definitely one of the best burgers I have ever had! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you are broke or cheap....cause these burgers aren't either.  However, the Kobe beef burger maybe the BEST burger I have ever had my entire life and I am not exaggerating.  Our server recommended it because the meat is tender and buttery and whole cow (pun intended) was it fricken awesome.  Its modern casual atmosphere with great service and excellent french fry options and shakes and super good strawberry lemonade.  Parking blows at the Biltmore so park in the garage in back so you have shade and it cost you nothing."}
{"text":"Saw it being built and thought the building was cool looking,  saw it opened and decided to stop by with friends.  I must say this is the best burger joint in Arizona that I've had.  I had the Ringer burger and I loved everything from the buns, meat, and the vegitables.  I'd highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick meal before seeing a movie and it was perfect. Made a reservation so we were seated right away and the service was prompt and awesome. I had the turkey burger and it was hands down the best turkey burger I've ever eaten. Also the truffle fries were amazing. Yes it is expensive for a burger place but the quality of the food and the service makes it absolutely worth it. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Good burgers (you can easily split with someone if you're not a big eater).  Onion rings were very good.  Highly recommend the salted caramel shake; it's worth the trip just for the shake.  Nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Thought I would enjoy it quite a bit better than I did.

BARSTAFF-Right off the bat we sat at the bar, in the food for some conversation, that usually comes from the bartenders at any place, however after having two menus thrown down with out anything being said, it started off very unwelcoming. Without the help of , what seemed to be the manager, the bartender girl never said one word to us except\" see ya\" as we got up.( the manager did everthing from take orders and make drinks, but seemed annoyed like she didnt want to be helping the obviously slow bartender)

Chow & Grub- Truffle parm fries were tastly,but take off the top ten fries and it looked like the bottom of the barrel , just crumbs and bits.My guy ordered the Samburger which he devoured,(literally, breathe baby!!) so thumbs up there! I oredered the Roasted chicken salad , that comes with pomagranate seeds and goat cheese. It was delish! I would high highly recommend this.

The Look- standard clean fresh peppy, Fox place, nothing stand out. Clean and fresh. Good looking staff. :)

Break it down Jess-
Given the greatness of my salad I want to give this more stars but the bad service and attitude was just too awful. It seems like a fun and fresh( yes I have said that) place and didnt pull its weight with such bad staff. The salad could be gotten elsewhere."}
{"text":"YUM - we wanted to go somewhere else and a suggestion was made to stop here...surprisingly we have never been!

We hoped up to the bar. It wasn't that busy so we sat and ordered a couple drinks - however the bartender seemed either flustered or tired and forgot my bloody at first. No biggie cause it was good. Comes with some bacon too!

The menu is pretty straight forward and simple however the options are so good its hard to decide. We were originally going to get the zucchini fries to share, but decided since sides don't come with the burger, we would get them as a side and get onion rings as well. 

I had the Samburger - which was delicious. The meat could have used a slight more seasoning, but I have a feeling they backed off because of the bacon which is OK because it was pretty salty and took care of that element - but if I didn't have the bacon, it would have needed more (there were plenty of bites with out bacon). Hubs had the turkey sloppy Joe which was just an awesome version of comfort food. They serve theirs with cheese and a pablano to fancy it up - but they totally could have just given you a bowl of it and it would have been amazing.

All around - ok service with great food. Both of us commented that it must have been an off day for the server because he also forgot the extra pickles I asked for - and the service wasn't typical of the Fox Restaurants. 

Will definitely have to go back and try some of the other menu items because we actually had a really hard time deciding on what we had!"}

{"text":"We went last night for the first time. The wait was 50 minutes which is normal for anything on Saturday night. Once we sat down, service came pretty quickly and our server was friendly. I ordered a kilt lifter draft, 20oz.
I had read reviews that the zucchini fries came out soggy, so I asked our server about this. He said he could have them made extra crispy and they came out just perfect, crispy on the outside, but not overcooked.
I had a My Boy Blue, which was yummy. It's a little greasy and messy but in my opinion that's the way a good burger should be. The wife had a veggie burger vegan style (with mozzarella, sans bun and mayo) and she enjoyed it. Finished it off with the Nutella shake. It had too many chunks of toffee and nuts to make the straw any use, but came with a spoon. Delicious. We will go again."}
{"text":"Our first experience here will be our last. The food was mediocre, at best. The service should have made up for it, but it fell far short. We were served by a socially awkward, incompetent waitress that forgot our existence. To top it off, she said she was going to get her manager, AFTER 5 minutes passed, she came back without a manager. Apparenty he would not come address the inadequacy of his staff, making it obvious he is well aware of the problem but refuses to correct it. It is clear during the corporate manager training session on how to addesas customer service, he fell asleep. Not worth the overpriced trumped up charges for their \"Zinburger.\" No where near Zin status."}
{"text":"First time into Zinburger. I tried the Chuck Norris and my Fiancé tried the El Diablo. My Chuck Norris featured onion rings and barbeque sauce and it was pretty good. The El Diablo really had no heat or flavor which was disappointing. The fries were good. Like every other Fox concept restaurant this restaurant is good, not great. I can think of 5 other burger places I would think to go to before Zinburger would come to mind. Our service was good and the atmosphere was nice. A bit expensive even if you stick to the angus patty. We did order a beer and the white sangria, both were fine."}
{"text":"All the burgers are great, just depends on what you feel like at the time! Fries are also great. Salads also superb. Lots of yummy choices for suds to wash the burger and fries down with. Good spot to watch a game st the bar!! Never disappointed."}
{"text":"I recently went here with a friend whom is a loyal costumer of zin burger, although he admitted he's never been to this location before. So we decided to try it out! Lovely decorated and friendly staff. Ordered a \"make your own burger\" burger. I got a burger, with guacamole, bacon, fried egg, lettuce, tomato, pickles and American cheese. It was very delicious and fairly big! Complimented very well with their fries. Which to my opinion is fairly good. Nothing out of this world, but the burger compensates."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and loaded fries. I got the \"zin burger\" with a very good glass of ZIN!! When in Rome..."}

If you haven't been here, get here as soon as possible. Every single piece of this place is outstanding. The food, the service, the ambiance, and even the wine list! If you have been here, come again and bring someone who has not. They will thank you, maybe even ask you to marry them."}
{"text":"I recommend the half farm salad with grilled chicken. Very fulfilling. Service is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Pros-good food, good atmosphere 
Cons-it takes an hour + to get your food, the service is very very slow. My dad's burger came out cold although the rest of the dinner parties seemed to be ok. When we were waiting for our table we noticed several un-cleaned tables that we could've been sitting at if they would have cleaned them off. The food is very good, but dannnnnggg it's just soooooooo slow! It's too bad really. Not sure if we'll be back again."}
{"text":"These really are the best burgers.  And love the fries as well.  But what really made it a great experience is Emily.  Service can be so hit or miss. Emily was engaging and friendly. That is really hard to find these days. We love this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now since they opened. My first impression was excellent. As my husband and I walked in, the host staff was eager to open the door for us and they were extremely friendly! The host staff was also completely on top of opening the door for me when I went to the restroom. Whoever is training the hosts is doing a GREAT job. They made us feel very special as customers.

The serving staff that we've experienced is another story.. The first time we were at Zinburger service was OK. There was one bartender who was amazing. I wish I could remember her name. The other 3 bartenders were never in a hurry to help customers. They were more concerned with cleaning and talking to each other as well as other waitstaff. I must mention, we ordered the loaded fries to enjoy with our drinks and they were AWESOME. You've gotta try them!

Our second time there was a hot mess. The first time we didn't have burgers, so we wanted to go back a second time for a full meal. I love a good burger so I was really excited. My husband and I both ordered our burgers medium. We both cut into them to find that they were as well done as they could have been. We waited for 5 minutes or so to let our server know, but she never came so decided to just eat them. My bun was so soggy with grease that the bottom bun completely fell apart. I ended up eating my burger open with just one side of a bun. Our server finally came over to us once we were almost done eating. My husband and I both ordered another beer from her, then we never saw her again. Literally, we sat there for 35 minutes with empty glasses and nobody ever came over to us. I realized at that point that maybe our server left? It seemed to be maybe a shift change time. I decided to wait 10 more minutes before finding someone to give us our tab so we could just get out of there. I ended up going up to one of the hostesses (who once again was extremely nice). I told her that we hadn't seen our server for 45 minutes and that we just wanted our tab. She was apologetic, and said she would get someone to bring it to us. 10 minutes later some guy finally brought it to us. This situation was certainly disappointing. You would think that management would be working the restaurant walking around checking on customers. It shouldn't have been so difficult to be a customer. And I'm not even a picky customer. Throughout those 45 minutes without a server I would have been completely fine if I would have had either a drink or my check! We didn't even have water! 

This Zinburger has only been open for a couple of weeks, so hopefully these issues are things that will get sorted out. Once again though, good job to whoever trains the hosts. They really are awesome."}
{"text":"Visited on a hot and sunny afternoon while out shopping with my mom. We got seating right outside and even though the chairs were a bit cold and uncomfortable, it was nice to sit by a fountain and enjoy our meals.

The staff there is pretty young but still great. We enjoyed bun less burgers (ordered the spicy kind without cheese) and split sweet potato fries with a spicy dipping sauce that lit my mouth on fire. It was really great!

Prices were reasonable for the area and overall I wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"First time here today!

Henry our server was phenomenal! He is defiantly an asset to Zinburger. He made the experience wonderful and was extremely friendly. He was always on top of where our food and drinks were at all times. 

I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the breakfast burger. The buffalo chicken was tasted good but the piece of chicken was huge, too big. It was a little on the harder side to eat. The breakfast burger was on point. The meat was juicy and cooked to perfection and the fried egg takes it to a whole other level of deliciousness! 

The prickly pear margarita was my favorite! The make it just right, that way you dont get a straight taste of tequila. I wish i could have gotten it togo :)

Great experience and good food! we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've finally tasted the best fries topped with anything ever! The spicy green chili fries were amazing! Got the breakfast burger w/ over easy egg so the yoke could marinate the burger and it was like cocaine in the 80's.. AMAZING!!! Been bartending 13 yrs (8 as a master bartender) and their apple orchard mule was a perfect refresh for the taste buds. Prickly pear was a hair off. Normally prickly pear will hide the \"alcohol\" flavor of tequila and accentuate the actual flavor of the tequila itself. But 5 stars for sure! By far the best bar view in Gilbert. Super awesome spot. Thx zinburger"}
{"text":"A burger and fries place, only upscale!  Zinburger offers beef burgers which are a mix of Angus and Kobe style beef for your standard patty, although you can use 100% Kobe for $5 more.  They offer several different variations on the standard burger and fries, and also offer a veggie burger, chicken, ahi tuna, and turkey for those that aren't beef inclined.  They also offer upscale milkshakes ($6 each) with flavors such as bananas foster and creme brulee.  

We ate here for dinner on a Sunday night, and had a fairly large party to seat.  There were no problems getting seating for us when we arrived (Around 5:30 P.M.), and service was prompt.  I had the bananas foster shake ($6), double truffle fries ($6), and a veggie burger ($9).  I also had some of the El Diablo burger ($10).  The shake was thick, rich, and had a nice light banana flavor from the fresh bananas.  The ice cream they use here is Breyer's, which was a nice touch.  The double truffle fries were nice and they were hand cut, but a lot of our fries were \"frylets\" in that they were smallish pieces of potato rather than average sized strips you can easily grab with your fingers (Versus having to grab a lot at a time with the \"frylets\").  I could taste a lot of white truffle flavor from the white truffle oil they used in both the fries and the aioli.  The aioli itself though tasted like white truffle infused mayo rather than a garlicy aioli.  

The veggie patty was nice in that it tasted like it was made fresh vs. using a already-formed patty.  It was a black bean mixture, and while the sides of the burger had a nice crunch to combat the mushy texture of the bean patty inside, the inner part of the burger tasted like mushy black beans.  Perhaps some grain inside of the burger would help to provide extra texture.  In addition, it was nice that they added smoked mozzarella to the burger, but I couldn't taste much smokiness nor much cheese although it was melted on the patty.  The veggies accompanying the burger were fresh and plentiful, including large slices of creamy avocado.  

The El Diablo burger I tried was better.  It was juicy, and cooked perfectly to order (Medium), and had great beef flavor from the burger and the spicy condiments.

So, going to Zinburger, if you're not a vegetarian, your best bet is to stick with the beef burgers, and be sure to get a yummy shake to go with your meal.  Your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"What a perfect burger! Typically, you need to read about everything on a menu and probably find a hidden gem. Zinburger puts their best burger at the top...The almighty Zinburger! Amazing service, great truffle fries in a fun atmosphere. They even had Dale's on tap and the best shakes in town. When I'm in the mood for a burger, I do not go farther than the Scottsdale Qtr and grab a Zinburger!!"}
{"text":"We called ahead to get our table ready for a big group and they texted us right as we pulled up. It was great timing and worked out wonderfully!  Super fun atmosphere! We sat on the patio with 5 other couples at a round table & it was one of my favorite group dates!! Love this place & the simple but unique menu! I think we ordered all the fry- varieties & they were so yummy. The zucchini was probably my favorite. Green chili was a close second! I normally love sweet potato fries but these were just a little bit soggy. I didn't mind them. But my husband thought they were gross. The burgers were so good and exactly as the menu describes them! Our food did not take long at all and our waitress was so friendly & right on top of drinks!! I would highly recommend this place for a fun night out with friends. But parking is a little bit of an obstacle in downtown Gilbert! Plan ahead for that!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice when visiting my li'l bro' in Gilbert.  Zinburger does just about everything right.  Great ambiance.  Fun staff.  Reasonable prices.  Decent wine list.  Oh, what?  You ask about the food?  Damned good, I say.  Of course, burgers call for zinfandel, so that's my pairing.  The boigas are fat, plump, juicy and flavorful.  For my preference, they're a bit over cooked, but hell I like my meat still kickin' (somewhere between steak tartar and rare).  The wine list is good; however, with the name \"zin\", one would expect a (far more) robust wine list, particularly one that pairs to the foods.  That's the only real weakness here.  The fries are killer.  Killer.  Will return next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Service: great service! Fast with delivering food. Filled water appropriately. 

Environment: lively environment. Modern look. TVs at bar. Open space. Indoor and outdoor options. Very clean. 

Parking: lot and structure. free. 

Food: we got zucchini fries and loaded fries. Zucchini fries were ok. Loaded fries has bacon, sour cream and queso cheese. The toppings were great but the fries were more on the soggy/not fresh tasting. 
Had the Bruce Lee burger. Highly recommend the burger. Sweet and tangy."}
{"text":"We checked in, got our drinks and almost 15 mins later the server remembered to take our order... A little slow for my pace. We liked the \"text\" service for tables. I had the Breakfast burger and The Ringer with sweet potato fries... Yummy, but super Messy! Especially my Breakfast Burger.  We would've given this place 5 stars... But service was a little slow. Great finish with the Hazelnut Shake!"}
{"text":"First off, you need to know that the men's bathroom is haunted. I'm not kidding. I sat outside for probably 15 minutes waiting for whoever was inside to come out, then finally I asked the manager if he had a key. Maybe no one was even in there? So the manager unlocked the door and looked inside- there was no one in there. So maybe someone had accidentally locked the door before closing it? Nope- the door locks with a deadbolt, so only someone from inside can lock it. Maybe it was locked from the morning before? Nope, that exact manager said that he had opened it earlier in the day. So yeah... there's a capricious entity haunting that bathroom. 

Anyhow.

Their food is damn fine here! We had a selection of a few different burgers, and some green chili fries. Everything was really good, but I honestly can't say that I'll be coming back. Not from any fault of the food or the service or anything at all like that- it's just not really my type of place. It's a fancy burger place, and for me personally I prefer a more low-key type of restaurant. But if you're looking for a nice night out with a few glasses of wine and a tasty burger, then this would be a great place!!"}
{"text":"Not the best service but the burgers are pretty amazing. Tend to be a bit overpriced (or more than I like to pay for a burger) so definitely try and go during Happy Hour. A friend got the veggie burger and wasn't impressed (fell apart quickly) but I've loved every burger I've tried and they feature a special burger each week (which makes it easy to come back often). The shakes are good, and huge, so I recommend splitting one (they'll even divide it for you). Overall a definite thumbs up."}
{"text":"Omg!! Great burger and wine !!! This Zinburger is better than the biltmore location in my opinion. The customer service was awesome, Taylor our server was fabulous!! His knowledge of the menu and using other ingredients to enhance the burger was amazing! The wine selection really complimented the burger.  The wines we tried were the Manifesto and Lost Angel."}
{"text":"Touch and go for lunch and blown away! This place had great burgers, and the fries were insane."}
{"text":"With my 2 children (9 & 6), takin our new Nanny out for dinner...we agreed to the 45 min wait.  It's fine, but after being in the restaurant industry for 15+ years...I watched a table on the patio stay in-sat for 16mins!  On top of that...there are multiple other tables that are taking 8+ minutes to reseat after bussed.  To bad..but, will not be back here unless it's off peak hours.  

It's Friday night...7:30.  Staffed to the hilt...not the best experience."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  We've had a gift card to use for nearly 2 years and finally decided on Zinburger.  Happy we did.  Service was great. As was the food.  I had the Blanco and truffle fries. Delicious. I only ate half my burger to save room for a salted caramel shake.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Have to update my review to 5 stars!   Went again after management contacted me about my previous experience.  This time everything was great.  We got our seat quick.  We had Dakota as our server.  He was very attentive even he had a 10 ish ppl party he was serving next to us.  Burgers were still good as before!  I'm glad I went back :)."}
{"text":"I took my wife here tonight. Two burgers, a side of fries, and two glasses of water... total price $37 after the tip. We both liked the burgers, but I like my money more."}
{"text":"I recently went to Zinburger for a friends birthday (they accept reservations for larger parties, which is The restaurant was packed, and they were still able to provide stellar service and serve amazing food! You can't go wrong with the Hava Chicken Sandwich and Double Truffle Fries!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. Not only was the food worth more than the price but also our waiter provided some of the best service we have ever received.

My wife and I were not very hungry, so we ordered one large caesar salad and one \"Plain and Simple\" for the two of us, meaning to share them. We assumed we could simply eat the salad out of the bowl and then cut the burger in half when it arrived. To our delight, first the large salad was already \"halved\" and served in two bowls, one for each of us of course. Then the burger arrived already perfectly sliced in half, served on two plates.

Both the salad and the burger were excellent, the ambience very pleasant and, of course, the service was beyond outstanding if that is possible.

We'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Am always surprised by the family style service and a great burger shout out to Steffi and Jamie once again"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Ryan and Tabby were my bartenders and their service was outstanding. They were both attentive, answered any questions I had regarding their drinks and food, and always came to me with a smile."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want a delicious burger. I suggest splitting the green chili fries with a friend to make sure you have room for a burger. The burger I got was the El Diablo because I love spicy food and I always add bacon (burger was a little cold this time around). Also get a milkshake because they are delicious.

Only thing I don't like is that you have to get fries to go with the burger and the price adds up quickly. Not a place to go if you want a cheap bite to eat."}
{"text":"The food is just alright. Overly greasy food from the burgers to the fries/fried zucchini. Got a veggie burger and even that was super heavy and felt over fried. The burger concepts made me very excited but slightly disappointed when the food came out. Will not be returning for sure but you live and learn. Not worth the price or the hour long wait for the feeling the food leaves you with the rest of the day. In n out would have been a better choice!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 2.5/5
Happiness - 4/5

Zinburger is fine. I feel a gourmet hamburger walks a very fine line. On its own, hamburgers are easy to make and incredibly delicious. Typically, I find that gourmet placed add too many ingredients, play with the meat too much, use buns that are ill-fitted for hamburgers, and in so doing, ruin the brilliance of a burger. I have been to gourmet burger joints that have elevated, but more often than not, they careen down the chasm of bad burgers in their belief that bigger is better. Zinburger teeters on the edge of too much tinkering. 

The meat is always loose, wet and lacks much in the way of flavor. The buns they use often seem overwhelmed by the massive amount of toppings that accompany most burgers. The toppings themselves are typically unnecessary (to be fair, you can build your own burger).

What Zinburger does really well is virtually everything else. The milkshakes come in a good portion and are very delicious (and look great). The regular fries are forgettable, but the zucchini sticks, sweet potato fries and especially the absolutely delicious truffle fries are worth the extra price. The beer and wine list is nice and the bar is well set-up. There are always plenty of kids around, so they are very kid-friendly too. 

The managers are always very nice and receptive. We ate there recently and my mom felt her meal was undercooked. With no questions asked, the manager gave us 25% off our meal. And the restaurant was jam-packed, so she surely must have been busy dealing with far more problems than my mom's unreasonable definition of \"well-done.\" Yet she took the time to make us feel special. If only the food were as good as the service."}
{"text":"This place is super yummy. It's a great spot to meet with friends for dinner. We each ordered a burger and wanted to share, so they split them for us and served them half N half. We got spicy green chili fries, the ringer, & the buffalo chicken sandwich. Fries were bomb, the ringer is a negative, but the buffalo chicken sandwich was so good!"}
{"text":"DOG FRIENDLY patio seating. 

This is a great place for dinner and we brought our dog and so did the couple we had dinner with. The service staff were totally gushing over our medium sized dogs and even brought them their own water dishes. The server was friendly and our order was accurate. I left here super stuffed because I could not stop eating all the amazing food!"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because has an appealing environment, good food & service.

I'm not a fan of high priced burgers with limited options, unless you go for a basic $9 burger with nothing on it, then get charged $1.25 for every topping added after that. If I'm in the mood for a burger and a beer, I'll stick to Smash Burger!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a burger and enjoy the outside activity. Great beers on tap and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Napa salad was excellent. The goat cheese vinaigrette is a recipe I must figure out how to create. I enjoyed my burger though cooked a bit overdone. I asked for medium and medium should have a titch of pink. This burger was medium well +. Not as dry as could have been given the overdone ness. Probably because it was quality meat. I had the zinburger and it was very flavorful and the bun was really good. Typically buns are uneventful and can be tough or dry. This one fresh and tasty

I sat at the bar and server attentive and when I ordered she said salad would be right out. I don't think 20 minutes constitutes right out. But it's a fun place to people watch so I didn't mind the delay. But don't tell me \"salad will be right out\" if it won't be.

I am in phoenix on business so probably won't return anytime soon. But if I do, I'd come back. The menu has a lot of good options.  I had a hard time deciding"}
{"text":"Zinburger! What happened? You changed your buns....you changed your truffle fries. You were the best burger in the Nation. At least you still have excellent service. Sigh."}
{"text":"We went for our first time the other day for lunch. I really don't have a ton to say other than turkey burger was really good. Very flavorful. The truffle fries are amazing! The service is pretty good. The only complaint is if you sit on the patio beware of the flies. I have eaten outside alot at places but the flies here were out of control. I think the patio may be close to a trash area for the mall because it was really bad. With that said, eat inside because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Best damn Zucchini Fries  I have ever had, sprinkled with parmesan and served with a home made ranch. They are in no way healthy and in every way delicious.  These things will blow your mind. My favorite is the Samburger $10, Applewood Smoked Bacon, substitute Pepperjack cheese.  I really love this place and it is in my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Seriously....How is this place never on azcentrals top ten burger lists.  This place hand makes everything there and it shows in taste and quality.  seriously one of the best burgers I have ever had!  I laughed when I recently seen one of the wine burger establishments on azcentrals top ten list because friends and I tried it out and they sucked!  I think zinburger should be on that list.  Our fav picks are the Sam burger and the Kobe burger with sweet potato fries!  Heavenly!  Also they now have a new location in north Scottsdale so looking forward to trying 2nd location."}
{"text":"We had a great experience taking our out of town guests to Zinburger at the Quarter. I made reservations for our group of 8, we were seated on the patio near the gorgeous palm trees, so the location was perfect. The food was very good, but it was the server who made the experience fabulous. Mallory was absolutely delightful! She was so accommodating for our group, friendly and so efficient. Thank you Mallory for a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"When I assess a restaurant, I look at several factors. First, taste of the food. Also, value, service, and atmosphere. The taste of the food was good, but nothing exceptionally special. I think my husband's words were, \"I've had this exact burger someplace else.\"  I concur. And for the price, it was a bit steep. Could have gone to Red Robin for as good a burger and half the price. But, I'm glad we tried this place; I have been a general fan of Sam Fox's for a while. I had the turkey burger and it was good and very filling. Our waitress was very nice, but took so much time with each table that she took forever to get around to everyone. So....I am glad I came but won't be back."}
{"text":"I was treated to lunch here as an early birthday lunch from a friend in February. We were excited to come here because we had been to the Tucson location a few years back and loved it. 

Well I was very disappointed. 
The wait times for the restaurant during lunch seemed unacceptable to me. There were tables open while we were waiting. That usually means the restaurant was not properly staffed, which translates into poor management. 
The food needs a lot of work. The burgers were so \"juicy\", and not in a good way, the bottom roll was soaked to the point where picking up the burger was impossible and the nice flavor I remember from the Tucson location was nowhere to be found. The food also came out to lukewarm. Maybe sat in the window far too long? 
Best thing were the zucchini fries, we loved those.
The restaurant has a very nice appearance and they did a great job decorating , I hope they can fix the other issues soon."}
{"text":"Literally everything is delicious. The banana shake, ahi salad, and spicy French fries are my favorites. They also have good truffle and zucchini fries."}
{"text":"I do enjoy my FRC restaurants.  They're all so hip and cool-looking.  I had the Sam burger, which the special of the week.  It was bacon and two types of cheese.  The burger was huge, juicy, and oh-so-flavorful.  I am a glutton for punishment and also ordered the apple pie shake and banana cream pie.  Man alive, that stuff is GOOD!  The banana cream pie is made daily and has huge chunks of bananas, and the crust is perfect.  The shake is as the name states, and tastes like the pie in liquid form.  As you can guess, I left the place with a food gut!"}
{"text":"I usually love all FRC restaurants. I came in to order their Banana Cream Pie to go. I sat at the bar and ordered at 6:07. It was ready at 6:19! The restaurant wasn't busy, and the bartender didn't even apologize for the extraneous wait. You literally had to slice the pie and place it in a box. On the plus side, the pie was delicious as always."}
{"text":"Wine and Burgers...two things that I admire and enjoy so much.  This restaurant fills both of those needs in a stylish, modern looking location on the front side of the Biltmore Fashion Park.  

There are several burgers, sandwiches, and salads to choose from that are all created nicely.  Also not to forget any of their different style of fries and shakes that will helpful in a sinfully delightful experience.  Prices are moderate to near the high end for the type of cusine, but pretty much in line for the area.  

The inside has a large wall/mural of cows grazing which is somewhat strange, but I'd say it's different in a good way.  Earth tones are abundant throughout creating a natural, relaxed atmosphere.  The place can get very loud when busy however.  With the design of the restaurant I don't think much or any attention was focused on the acoustics.  I wouldn't recommend coming here for a quiet time.

This is another restaurant that the Fox Restaurant group has created well receiving an instant buzz.  Great location, very good food, excellent service ,and a upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome! Happy hour burger, zucchini fries and salad. All three excellent! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"As always, an establishment of Fox Restaurant Concept doesn't disappoint. This was our second time here, which is a rarity because with so many places to eat, we want to experience as many places as possible without duplication. But, we saw a gift card for FRC at Costco and couldn't pass it up.

Hubs got the blanco burger with Kobe beef for a $5 up charge. My daughter and I got the Diablo and the zinburger. The boy got the $3 kiddie burger, which is a killer deal. All burgers were cosines with much delight. 

Katie, who was our server was phenom! Her service truly made the dining experience top notch. 
Katie noticed my daughter and I were talking about splitting our burgers so we could try each other's. When the burgers came out, they were both cut equally so it made it easy to split and mix up our plates. Mind you, we didn't have to ask her to do this. She did it on her own, which was very much appreciated and stands as a true testament to what a wonderful server she is. She also split our milkshake into two glasses knowing we were sharing. Katie. Thank you for your thoughtfulness."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had the double burger, would definitely recommend any burger on the menu! Fries and other sides are indeed sold separately!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the hostess staff.  Walked in on a not-busy evening, about 5:50.  Despite 3 hostess-types milling about, no one even greeted me.  Waited about 3 minutes, then I approached one and was told \"One of THOSE girls can help you.\"  One finally sauntered over and told me there would be a 15-20 minute wait, even though I pointed out an empty booth.  I am the only party waiting for a table.  Fast forward 25 minutes, and I am shown to my table - the very same one that had been sitting empty for the last 25 minutes.  Wow.  Just wow.  That said, the food was pretty good.  Be aware, they cook their burgers on the \"rare\" side of whichever doneness you like.  So if you're used to a traditional \"medium.\" you might consider ordering medium-well.   It is still pretty pink.  The onion rings were delicious!  4 stars for food and wait staff.  1/2 star for hostesses."}
{"text":"This Friday night, November 10th 2017, my family and I went to to enjoy great burger at this establishment. The dinner was great and the service amazing. Nevertheless, throughout the end of our dinner, we experience a disgusting scenario, where a cockroach went up my back, and up to the top of my shirt. This is supposed to be a good restaurant at a great location, where hygiene should be essential. I would not be able to enjoy another meal at this restaurant, having to watch over my back, if their is any other insect or something else trying to climb my body. The cockroach was not able to be killed by the waiter, as it went under the tables. If this happened where the customers are, I couldn't imagine how it would be at the kitchen, where all the food is kept. Please be aware of this before going to this place."}
{"text":"This Vegetarian LOVES Zinburger!!  I was a first timer last weekend.  I had the veggie burger; shared zucchini fries AND sweet potato fries with my husband.  Hubby had some big manly burger and our friends shared a different manly burger and a salad.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Service was great, very friendly server.  The bathroom was clean.  I will never go again at lunch on a weekend though...it was insanely loud with kids.  I wasn't going to mention this but I also had a choc milkshake, I thought the four of us would share it but I had to eat the whole thing myself.  It was AMAZING, but I was full for three days. Ok, maybe not three days but I did not eat again this day.  Yum!"}
{"text":"We were on the waiting list and decided to leave when we heard your servers talking about patrons and what they have on. Comments about a patrons weight or their attire is 100% inappropriate. We always tip 25% or more but we will not be tipping your servers tonight as their crude comments about a lady who was plus sized  in a dress were so inappropriate we'd rather eat jack in the box!"}
{"text":"There is typically a decent size wait for this great burger joint. Luckily when we visited them last night we got right in and ordered. The price relative to the portion size is a good deal. There turkey burger is huge and offers spectacular flavor. The only downside is unlike most other burger joints this place does charge you for fries or salad as a separate side. In my opinion They should come with the burger with an upgrade charge if you order the more expensive class of fries."}
{"text":"I purchased  the Bruce Lee Burger and husband had the large salad. Both very good, delicious.  Only the burger shouldn't be 11 bucks. Ouch. Not very big for the cost. Meat doesn't cover the bun. 
The staff and restaurant are nice. 
Worth trying it for yourself. We love downtown Gilbert. 
Thank you"}
{"text":"Great location with a clean, fun atmosphere. Burgers were cooked exactly as ordered and were very tasty! We also had the onion rings. Well, I had three and my son the carnivore scarfed up the rest before he realized there was no meat involved :O)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time as I am a big fan of the Sam Fox restaurants, but I have to say I was extremely disappointed with all facets of our food and experience. First off, service took so incredibly long. Yes, they were busy. But if you have a busy restaurant, you hire more staff, you don't let the customer service suffer. My margarita I ordered was terrible. It tasted like someone just mixed some sort of minute maid juice with too much tequila. Got loaded fries as an appetizer and they tasted like they were frozen fries, whether they are or not I don't know, but to have the taste and texture of frozen fries is not ideal for a plate of 7$ fries. I ordered an el diablo burger; there was absolutely 0 flavor in the meat patty. Tender? Yes. Juicy? Yes. flavor? none whatsoever. I can make tender meat all day long, but if it has no flavor then what is the point; especially when you're paying as much as you do for a gourmet burger. It didn't even have any sort of grilled flavor. I will give them one more try, you can't fully judge a place with one visit and if I find it to be better I will update this, but I must say it was an extremely disappointing visit."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night, and we did not have the best experience. However the manager made contact and make sure that everything was right for us. My boyfriend and I sincerely appreciate it and we will definitely be trying your location again in the future. Thank you for caring about your customers."}
{"text":"I frequent Zinburger. I've noticed the portions are getting smaller and smaller. A lot of items are now off the menu. Don't order the fries you barely get any."}
{"text":"We consider this place as comfort food (burgers and fries to be exacts). We know what we are craving for, and we come here just for that. Also though, recently the Kale Salad was removed from the menu...We wish for it to come back soon. Otherwise, We always enjoy the food, fries, beers, wines, and good vibes with all the traffic arounds...after all, this is Biltmore ! Kids love the burgers and Milk Shakes...but the regular fries."}
{"text":"If you want a good burger with a nice atmosphere, then this is the place for you.  Phoenix has tons of great burger spots, but this one is a gem.  Part of Fox restaurants you know it's going to be unique.  Burger of the week is always a nice pick, but even the classics are good.  Don't forget to grab you shake at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"You can't beat this location.. At Scottsdale quarter are you kidding me?  Let me finish up some shopping with a nice juicy burger at Zinburger.  They make some pretty good beef patties and you'll be wanting another after you finish the first one.  I enjoy their selection of burgers and fries.  Anything spicy on the menu and you can depend that I'll order it.  The green chili cheese fries are mouth watering.  Oh yeah, they also make fantastic milk shakes too.  Good burger, great service & great location.  I can see myself stopping in more than usual."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to update my review because the last 2 visits the wait was ridiculously long. When we went last night, I was given a rotten lettuce wedge with my food, and when I complained I was given a slightly less rotten lettuce wedge--which I didn't notice was rotten until I had eaten half. I've spent the better part of the day in severe digestive distress, as have the people who were with me.
Our appetizers also arrived about 10 minutes after we had finished eating our entrees. The manager removed my meal and the appetizers from our check but I feel that this was insufficient given my current level of illness."}
{"text":"I've had the most wonderful server the past few times that I have been to this location. I think the server's name was Maggie... She was very well versed with the menu items and had great suggestions in regards to what I should've ordered. I will definitely be requesting her again for my next visit! Love this place"}
{"text":"I eat here almost every day.  I buy gift cards for Fox Restaurant Concepts to get a free meal out of every 5 I get here.  I mean, wow. Clean food. Clean atmosphere.  Totally transparent feeling about the place.  Hate that they serve Kobe (all grown up Veal) but they do grind the meat in-house.  Sweet potato fries - if you get them to go, get 2 dipping sauces.  That stuff needs to be reverse engineered....in my kitchen.
Update***
Sometimes the service is spotty. I'm there so much I know like, every server. 90% are awesome. 5% are ok. 5% just sort of seem to be....meh. I hate that word."}
{"text":"We ordered the Zinburger, Samburger, Double Tuffle Fries, Zuchinni Fries and a Banana Royal Shake.

Not one thing sucked, it was all devoured. They will even being out your fries as appetizers while you wait.

It is pricey, burgers are 10-16 and fries are separate at 5-7 extra. Beers are 6.50 to 7.50 (at least the ones we got). 

But, this was quality food and very delicious. We will definitely be back!

Even if you just come for the shakes, they are worth it."}
{"text":"I was carving a bacon cheeseburger so you guys know I searched yelp for the best one in town!  I've heard so much about zinburger and couldn't wait to give it a try and see what the rave was all about!

Stopped by on a weeknight it wasn't super packed but there was a crowd. I have to say customer service was amazing. The hostess was very nice and welcoming. Our server was very nice and really knowledgeable on the food. We told him it was our first time there and he gave us a really warm welcome. (I wish I could still remember his name) he was really attentive and my son loved him. The menus are to the point MY KIND OF MENU!! 

I ordered  the Sam burger which is basically a cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon; HOT DAMN! Lol it was amazing the only complaint about it would have to be that I ordered it medium well and it came out pretty much well done. My friend ordered the diablo and in his own words \"the best jalapeño burger I have ever had, I would come back just for this\" my son loved his burger and his chocolate shake. 

We also ordered the truffle fries and the sweet potato fries. My favorite were the truffle honestly if you have ever had a Mexican style corn that is basically what these truffle fries taste like specially with the dipping sauce they provide. 

The only thing I would have to say they need to work on is faster food preparation. It did take a very long time for our meals to arrive, but maybe we caught them on a bad night (totally understandable).  All in all we had a wonderful experience at zinburger and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Came back to Zinburger for another fabulous 75 degree lunch on the patio. 

This time I ordered the zucchini fries, Kit Kat shake and Ahi Tuna salad. Everything was delicious. The salad had huge chunks of avocado, which I loved as well as cashews and a light dressing. Service was great too. 

I highly recommend Zinburger. Can't wait to come back and try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Their zucchini fries are delish! Had the buffalo chicken sandwich and was great. Highly recommend going to Zinburger!"}
{"text":"They have great burgers with tons of options, great tuna that is wild caught, delicious sides, and a fun atmosphere for kids or a night out."}
{"text":"Best Turkey Burger Ever!  Hands down!  YUM!  Joyful flavoring makes this thing amazing.  They understand cross contamination and I can get a gluten free bun with gluten free fries (dedicated fryer) and the fries are to die for too!  

The quality doesn't seem to change no matter what location you are at either!  This location is very clean, open and inviting.  The wait outside can be a bit hot in the summer as there isn't much room inside if it's busy but it is worth the hot mess to dine on this great food."}
{"text":"I took the kids to the Zinburger at the Biltmore today.  Our total bill was for $29.59.  I handed the server a gift card we won at a silent auction worth $25 and a $20 bill.  The server came back to me with $15.41 left on the gift card.  I wondered why he didn't take the money off the gift card first so that I could leave him a cash tip.  I left it alone, and figured we'd come back again and use the gift card.  So I asked him if I could use my Visa card to leave him a tip since he used the cash first instead of the gift card.  He asked his manager, and they said I couldn't use my Visa to leave a tip, but that I could give him what was left on my gift card as a tip.  I looked at him puzzled, what the hell?!?  That's a 50% tip!!!  I've never used a gift card to tip, EVER.  I always use cash to tip, and always over tip, especially for great service.  So instead of making my kids feel uncomfortable, I just gave him the card and left.  I've always enjoyed the Fox Concept restaurants, but I may not any longer."}
{"text":"Since I'm visiting from out of town, I was looking for a place to eat near my hotel. Zinburger did not disappoint. The hostess was friendly and the atmosphere in the restaurant was inviting and relaxing. The waitress was very polite and attentive.  I had the custom burger as there was so many choices to put on my burger. It was juicy and very tasty. I had the zucchini fries and a salad which came out together with my burger which I would have preferred to have the salad first. The zucchini fries were crisp and not soggy as you can sometimes get in some places. The price was also very reasonable for dinner. I would definitely come back again on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers in a fun and casual atmosphere.  I had a bacon cheeseburger with fries and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had.  The only thing that could've improved the burger would be having Hatch green chile available to add on. Highly recommend and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Today I Enjoying my first meal from here today and it was FANTASTIC! We got a root beer float to share (aka \"black cow\") and I got the zinburger - it was so juicy and flavorful. I'm so glad I tried it because  not really a fan of onions and it was so good! My husband got the breakfast sandwich and he is hard to please and he loved it! Go here! Oh and the kids menu is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"If you want good, gourmet burgers with a great service and an even better environment (both indoors & out) then this is your place. Might I suggest the SPICY GREEN CHILI FRIES paired with the BLANCO burger. Be warned, the Blanco is messy but oh so good! I regret not ordering a drink from the bar, but there's always next time. Should you go? Yes!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch, and really liked my experience.  My friend arrived early, and there was about a 30 minute wait.  He got a tag thingy and waited for me to arrive.

When I got there, the place was reasonably busy.  I loved the decor, and the hostesses were wonderful.  After we were seated, our server took our order.  The menu is simple, with a few different options to choose from.  I wasn't feeling particularly fancy, so I went with a regular hamburger.  We also ordered sweet potato fries which were delicious.  

Both of us had a really good time here.  The staff were really on top of things, checking in on us constantly and always refilling our drinks. I liked the decor too....I thought it was rockin cool!

I probably will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"The burger I had was delicious. I ate the Bruce Lee burger and it didn't disappoint at all! What a great combination of flavor!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! A bit pricey, but excellent quality.

Been here twice and haven't had anything we didn't like. The meat is great quality and they'll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that won't cook something below medium well.

Great toppings for burgers, fries and shakes. Although everything is so big and filling I certainly can't have all that in one trip!

Definitely a decadent tasty treat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Pretty expensive for a burger but very good.  The buns are extremely soft and don't get soggy like a lot of soft buns do.  You also can't get a combo... have to order side of fries which doesn't make sense to me.  I'll be back though... price and combo issue so can't give a full 5 star."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I ordered the Blanco burger and expected fresh pico, a nice guac layer and fresh piece of lettuce. Instead it looked as though all the ingredients had been put in a blender and regurgitated on my burger mixed with the mayo. My hamburger meat fell apart and was a mess. It just wasn't appetizing and the fries were overcooked and soggy. My kids chicken fingers were crispy as in almost burned and tough. Don't forget your burger doesn't come with fries so for about $11.50 on average you just get a burger. I had to add a $5 basket for fries just for myself. The service was great and the place is very cool looking with a great patio area but that's about all it has going for it."}
{"text":"Have ordered carry out twice. Burgers were perfect the first time. The second time they weren't cooked to order. One that was ordered well done was closer to med/med well. He doesn't like any pink so that was a bummer. Both times I noticed all fried items were kinda soggy. Definitely not crispy. Maybe this is better when you dine in but to us it seems like the fryer oil was not hot enough so everything was oil soaked. (between the two orders we tried reg fries, onion rings and zucchini fries) The shakes are great. We tried the Nutella and the Butterfinger. I'll add to once we try dine in.

Update: Was contacted mere hours after this review by the GM who was seriously cocerned about the food quality, appreciative of the feedback and graciously offered to make things right. I think she went above and beyond which is what you expect from GREAT MANAGEMENT! Zinburger, Kelly was a fantastic hire! Will keep you posted on our next visit."}
{"text":"Fabulous. 

Holy Kobe Beef Burger with Avocado, Bacon, and Cheese - It was the special of the day. I didnt care what it cost, I knew I had to have it. 

Come to think of it, that was the FIRST time in my life I've never ordered off the menu and actually went for the \"of the day\". I did it with my wine too!

I wasnt a HUGE fan of the parmesan fries, but I could be alone here. 

All in all, great place for some burger lovin! The milkshakes at the other table looked unreal!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a great burger and some drinks. The atmosphere is very relaxes and they jeep thus place very clean."}
{"text":"Zinburger is a welcome addition to the bar/restaurant scene that has developed in down-town Gilbert over the last several years. The restaurant is set up as an open air space ala Postino - with a focus on an eclectic selection of burgers. The place has a full bar with a respectable selection of draft beer and wine. Everything is served ala-carte with a great selection of fries or onion rings (the green chili fries absolutely rock). There is amble outside seating with heaters for the cooler nights during the winter. Zinburger is well worth a try when you need to satisfy your urge for a great burger."}
{"text":"Interesting burger join. Had their bruce lee and it was reasonably good. Excellent server who was outstanding, almost put her in my pocket to take her home.

{"text":"It was my first time here!!!! It was the best burger ever!!! Grass fed burger, double aioli fries and the farm salad!! All great choices. My mom and I shared all of these items and they already came split. That was especially nice for the salad! Total bill for the two of us was $29.00.  Not bad for the food we got. The service was top notch as well!!!"}
{"text":"I am tough on burger joints. My allegiance lies elsewhere...... but I seriously gave Zinburger a 150% shot. 

First of all, who wants to dine on a huge burger while staring a huge mural of a cow in the face? Not me! Makes me feel bad. Probably a big reason I am a fan of Chic'fil'A, eating chicken while staring at a cow, awesome! Anyway..... the decor is cool enough, other than the giant cow watching you eat his cousin. 

On to the food. $10-13 for a burger seems to be a standard these days for the upscale burger joints. So, it didn't really bother me. If it came with a side it would have been perfect. So the roommie and I want to get a good taste of everything so we shared a few options; the turkey burger, a glorified bacon/cheddar burger, double truffle fires, zucchini fries and a mint chocolate shake. 

1.) Turkey burger - probably the best I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, great flavor and seasoning and the toppings were great. Cabbage rather than lettuce is a genus idea! 
2.) Bacon/cheddar burger - meh.... could have gone without ever having this thing in my life. First of all we asked for it to be cooked medium and when it showed up the bun was a bloody mess, I would call that rare. The bacon and thousand island dressing battled to the death and neither won. Way too over powering for such a dominating burger. Over all, wouldn't order it again, ever! 
3.) Truffle fires - how do you f*** up truffle fries? It's damn near impossible. They were great. I could tell they were freshly cut and were served with an awesome aoli. Get 'em! 
4.) Zucchini fries - blech! Almost sent them back just to get them out of my face. Looked awesome and tasted worse than original Cheerios. The batter they are in sucks, is soaked up all the oil from the fryer, and were as soft as noodles. I tried to make myself eat 3 of them but couldn't take it anymore. 
and finally... 
5.) Mint chocolate shake - it was okay, in the most generous way. Way too much milk was added so within 5 minutes is had morphed into this sloppy-slushy-watered down concoction that bored me. Flavor alone, great! But the texture, disappointing. I will stick with the Diner, where they know how to do it right. 

I have to say the staff was great. Very friendly and were there to take care of any need we had. But for the food itself, I will only ever be back for my once every other month turkey burger craving."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, had the samburger and onion rings. Service was great, bartender was great, burger was good - wasn't blown away by it or anything but it was cooked properly. The onion rings were a let down - little undercooked and wasn't a fan of the breading/batter."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed. Server told us burgers were HUGE, so husband and I split a burger at servers request. Ordered it medium. Came even less done than rare. Sent it back. Came back cooked right the second time. Ordered onion rings and 2 sodas. I don't know if we had to pay a split plate charge on burger but bill was $25!! My silly husband never reviews the bill! And the burger itself wasn't huge at all. It tasted good but not great! Nothing over the top. I don't get the hype. Gave it a try. Moving on now."}
{"text":"One of the better burger places, first time here and I loved it. Service was awesome, very cheery atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in the Valley. We used to drive to Tucson from Mesa just for it, and we are stoked to have them here. Great food and good service. The Ahi burger is the best anywhere in the valley or at least up there with the one from Hill Stone. Probably my favorite FRC."}
{"text":"Both the burgers and service are amazing! They are a bit pricey for a burger, but you get what you pay for! Our order came quickly and our waitress was so friendly and helpful. My husband and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I rate them so low due to several issues experienced in one visit with service of the kitchen and staff.  The food quality was excellent, however the experience could be attributed to numerous scenarios such as a new restaurant, kitchen, food runners, or servers all culminating in this less than ideal experience.  I do credit the manager with taking steps to correct the experience only after I had to ask for the manager to visit the table a second time.  Let me explain...

Lunchtime service there is a zoo.  They're in a great location and they have a good reputation for a quality product.  This was my first visit with a co-worker.  Service took a little longer to visit the table and get our drink order but that's not a major issue for me, since it was busy.  I went with the Zinburger with kobe beef and zucchini fries.  Some of the questions I was getting from the server gave me the impression she was new, and I asked her to confirm that she got the Kobe beef upcharge for my burger.  My dinning buddy ordered a regular burger with truffle fries.

The burgers took some time to get out, most likely due to how busy they were.  As we noticed tables around us getting their burgers we figured we were next.  Then the table that sat and ordered after us got their order and I felt a mistake was made. Then the truffle fries were dropped off at our table, with nothing else. The food runner dropped food off at the wrong table and never confirmed the order with the guests.  That was our order.  Shortly after the server came by and realized the issue I had already discovered.  She apologized for the confusion and the manager came by to apologize for the issue as well.

Our order was remade and delivered.  My burger was overcooked but it was still delicious.  The quality of product is very good.  My zucchini fries were seasoned and breaded nicely but I would have preferred them a little more crispy on the batter.  I informed the server that my burger wasn't cooked correctly and showed her and she agreed claiming to inform the manager.  I wasn't about to send this burger back because I was teetering on hangryness.

Once the check came out they comped my burger, which I noticed didn't contain my upcharge for kobe.  So I ate a non-kobe burger after I specifically asked, and checked that it was included?  Additionally, I was not thrilled that they were insulting me by asking us to pay for the other items.  So I had to request the manager again and after I pointed out the lateness of the food and the incorrect burger and it being overcooked she said she would comp the entire meal.  That was the correct course of action in my opinion however I should have never had to request to speak to the manager a second time. We did leave +20% tip in cash and I hope this proves to be a good learning and training experience for them.

I think this will be a great spot for burgers but maybe they still need to figure out their logistics. I still want to try that Kobe burger but may need to wait on a day they won't be busy in a lunch rush and they've worked out their kinks."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time Saturday 7/15/17 about 2:30 PM. Small wait time, about 20 minutes. 
Our server arrived- Casey who was super pleasant & professional. He explained the entire menu after we said it was our \"first time\". Coming from working at a burger joint:  I was very impressed with their unique yet simplistic offerings. Only down side, burgers are pricey & sides are a separate/ additional charge. Big plus: everything is made to order and nothing comes in frozen or is stored on site frozen. Great concept, if you insure the timing is right! This chain is 1 of 10 restaurants under the same umbrella & each related setting has a new age/ edge twist! So cool! 
As we dinned: we noticed that the manger Tim was so \"hands on\", helping out & supporting his staff. That was impressive! 
For our meal- we had 3 burgers : The Zinbuger , simple & delicious. The Ringer, highlighted was the incredible flavored bacon. The Breakfast Burger with an egg (over easy) was a stand out & quickly wiped out! Haha
The sides we chose were the Zucchini fries that came with a ranch dipping sauce. Also got the truffle fries, but had them add fresh garlic. Hadn't had that request before, yet were still able to accommodate us at an \"extra fee\". It came with an amazing aioli sauce that we could have spread on everything. LOL
Customer servers was stellar & the food was extremely tasty too! Memorable experience!
We're intrigued to try their other restaurants which includes: Culinary Drop Out. It's rumored that one is to be built in Gilbert right across the street from them by next year!"}
{"text":"I am so pleased EVERYTIME my husband and I eat here. Last Sunday evening we even took our 4 year old son with us and they were very accommodating and all of their employees are happy and seem to enjoy being at work. 

My favorite is the green chili cheese fries and the chicken sandwhich. It's perfect every time. For my birthday they gave me the chocolate mousse cake and it's to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for ruining father's day!! I called 1.5 hours before we wanted to be seated to be put on your \"call ahead\" list. Arrive 15 minutes before we wanted to be seated. Checked in with hostess, told her we would be outside, she said I would  be texted when the table was ready, waited 30 minutes and went in to check. Found out they had inputted my number and gave the table away."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY?! My other half and I were craving burgers and recalled seeing a burger Resturaunt in the Biltmore the other day. I visited Zinburger expecting a no frills good ole hangout and good food... We walked in around 8pm on Friday and were \"greeted\" by a young brunette girl, it was the first nice night out of the season so we asked for a seat outside- she said it would be a few minutes. That immediately questioned things because the outside was less than half seated. I ran all possibilities through my head as to why she couldn't seat us right away- giving her the benefit of the doubt, while my other half wasn't so happy. We waiting for five minutes while she scattered around the front room, she finally came back and said it will be a few minutes because there are no clean tables- the tables were clean and already wiped down all that was missing were the placings. But again I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but wait! there were 7 ( I counted) waitresses/ staff standing around the kitchen entrance talking and laughing, great! She asked us for our name after all the time we had already been there and put it in her iPad, she ran off again to the back and no one cleaned the tables. She finally returned and just kept \"checking\" parties into her iPad. It was awkward all of the people waiting behind us waiting to be seated that even one party said \" you obviously are moving in to many directions [to the hostess] can I just sit down and wait\" Eventually we asked if we could seat ourselves at the table we requested outside considering it was empty and we had been waiting for 10 + minutes, she insisted the table had to be cleaned so we waited and still not an unjust soul cleaned it. Another few minutes went by and I insisted I sit down outside. Eventually menus and silver ware were brought. I was sad to find out this was a Fox concepts Resturaunt."}
{"text":"Best dog friendly dining spot in Phoenix! There's a patio area and I've asked to bring my pup here a few times and each time have had no problems. The staff Is always friendly and each time has brought out lots of water for my pup to enjoy, 

The food is delicious as well. The turkey burger is my favorite and the delicious shakes are heavenly. I love the casual, California type laid back atmosphere. It makes for a relaxing dining experience with friends. The staff is always very patient as well, since my friends and I spend most of the time sitting, talking and catching up, opposed to ordering and eating. The prices are pretty average, not as affordable, but not very pricey. 

Also, you can order and pay for to go items from the outdoor counter area, perfect if you have your pup with you and don't want to dine in, but want something a bit more delicious and healthier then the typical fast food drive through options. Also the counter is an outdoor bar area as well with a TV so if you just want a drinks and watch the game, you can do that too with your pup too. 

Overall have enjoyed my experience here every time!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Zin Burger on a Sunday night. Scottsdale Quarter was empty no one walking around. Seemed like only the restaurants were open. So we figured we wouldn't have to wait. Hahaha. Surprise on me. 30 minute wait. Really for a burger.... We asked if we could sit on the window stools. Bingo. No wait. So just remember if it's not that important to sit at a table then choose the window seats. 

Anyways,  I ordered the Blanco Burger. It was just a burger on a lonely plate with three pickles. Very unassuming. Expectations were lowered when I saw just the burger. But Oh my goodness. Such a good burger. It had Pepper Jack cheese, Chipotle mayo, Roasted Jalapeño, Pico De Gallo, and Guacamole. Nice little kick bit not too spicy. Nice little burst of flavors booming in your mouth. Really loved it. 

My wife ordered the Turkey burger. Great. Every time we order a turkey burger it's always dry and hard to swallow. My wife took a bite and she was very surprised. Wow. She thought it was really good. Juicy goodness. It had Swiss cheese , Avocado, and Sprouts. I stole a bite and it was really good. Nice and tender and juicy. Just the way a turkey burger should always be prepared. 

My son had the Sam burger. He didn't complain and gobbled up the burger. So I assume it was really good. The applewood bacon was huge with American cheese and thousand island dressing. Really really good. 

We ordered two orders of hand cut fries cause each order is really made for two people. Pretty good. Not bad. 

So our service was really good for being on the window seats. I thought that maybe they would forget about us. But no. Took our order. Got our drinks in a very timely manner and refilled our water cups. We were served just as good as the tables. Nice. One good thing about the window seats is you get to watch everything going on outside. 

So overall, a very good meal and burger. Probably one of the best burger I've had. I would have to say its right up there with Paradise Valley Burger Company. Only difference is that Zin Burger is more expensive. 

If your looking for a really good burger and don't mind paying 10+ for a burger then this is the place for you. Good food. Good service. Enjoy. We sure did."}
{"text":"The burgers are not that great. The quality of meat used is not great. AJs off FLW & Pinnacle Peak has way better burgers. Salted Carmel milkshake was good. Definitely would not give this another chance."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a fun lunch on my 10th anniversary. We had plans for that weekend go go to something more upscale but still wanted to do something on the actual day.

It was busy, something I wasn't all the surprised about being on the strip where many restaurants are located. Still, I wasn't thrilled with the inside seating. We ended up sitting at the center bench. It basically stretches along the center of the room and tables are set up along the side. Think IHOP because I certainly did. Not only that it was loud. Like the kids of loud where you can't really hear the other person unless you shout your way through. It was driving me crazy so I asked to be moved outside and that was much better.

Husband ordered the Breakfast Burger and I ordered El Diablo. Took quite a while getting the order out. I realize that it typically takes about 20 mins to cook a burger (kid of a restaurant owner) but it was about 40 mins before we got our food. Maybe they were backed up, no idea but it seemed a little too long from my point of view.

Burgers were okay, as well as the fries. Not the exceptional burger I was expecting though. Husband asked for medium and got just that but he said it was pretty bland over all. And I'm just going to say this, if there is a hot star by something, the thing should be hot. I mean, I'm not in the midwest. Give me some heat! Yeah, not at all. I could have fed this to my kids and they would have laughed at the lack of heat. Seriously. 

Because of the long weight, we ended up being short on time and decided to get shakes to go. Hubs got something caramel. I opted for the Nutella Hazelnut Crunch. Flavor was pretty good but I ended up having to wait till I got home to even taste it. The stupid hazelnuts wouldn't suck up through the straw they gave me. I was pretty annoyed at the taunt of chocolate but not being able to get at it. 

Over all, meh. I can't really see us going back. It was expensive for what you got and I wasn't all that impressed with the quality. Maybe I just hit them on an off day or lunch isn't the time to go. I can only judge on what I saw. We have friends who love the place so maybe they are seeing a different side. Or they don't know good burgers. Either way."}
{"text":"When I have the opportunity to actually sit down in the dining room and eat a full meal, I will write more. However, the bartendars have continuously been really sweet and generous in their concoctions of the whiskey ginger I always order hehe"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Zinburger!!! So happy there's one in Gilbert now. Closer to us than the Biltmore one. Everything is so yummy!!! Getting dessert is a must! We always get one Banana Cream Pie & one Chocolate Pie!"}
{"text":"Top notch burger joint. Really can't go wrong with anything (except not ordering a burger!). The basic burgers are solid but don't be afraid to get creative (Bruce Lee!!). Biggest concern is trying to save room for a milkshake. I haven't figured out how to do it yet but my kids have mastered it!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service great.  I recommend the zucchini fries!!!  The portions were very good and the quality of meat used for the burger was mouth watering.  My hubby does not like burgers yet he loved this place!"}
{"text":"We all liked our burgers with lots of choices based on your topping preference.  We also got and split the kale salad-- not split charge which is nice.   Our kiddos customized an onion ring and egg sandwich and split it!    Zucchini fries and truffle fries delicious although after our healthy dinner at true food last night, my stomach hurts."}
{"text":"Can't say a lot I had a bacon bloody mary and a side which was of course fab because I love bloody marys. My friend gave me some of her turkey burger which was the best, most juicy turkey burger I've ever had, even with mayo on it! I hate mayo. The burger didn't come with fries which I hate! If I eat a burger I want some fries and I don't want to pay more. I want to Grease it up and go all out. I got a side of parmesan zucchini fries which were nothing special.

I will definitely go back and try a burger when I'm in the area and the mood to treat myself!"}
{"text":"Nice modern vibe in this place with indoor and outdoor seating.  My husband and I enjoyed Zinburger.  My hubby ordered the breakfast burger.  This burger had a fried egg, avocado,cheese and bacon on a toasted bun.  We loved it.  Very unusual and tasty.  I ordered one of the specials which was a Kale Caesar salad and I added some chicken.  The Caesar dressing was good without being overpowering.  To round out the meal I ordered a bud light on tap while my husband tried the kilt lifter ale which he highly recommends.  Service was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not going to get crazy with a full-on analysis of a burger spot. However, I can say in typical fox fashion, this place is spot on. The food was great, atmosphere good - and very friendly staff that actually looked and felt like they genuinely wanted to assist you. As far as burgers goes, check this place out. definitely a nice new spin."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were treated to lunch here by my future inlaws.  I would have to say this was one of my top 5 favorite burgers.  I believe that I ordered the zinburger and I was impressed by how you could customize what you ordered.  They had plenty of cheeses and toppings that you could add or switch out with whatever was on the menu.  Also, if you do go here, order the zucchini fries!  They were amazing - perfect amount of batter/breading (just enough but in no way overwhelming the zucchini) and topped with some parmesan.  It is a little pricey - over $10 for the entree- but every now and then you should treat yourself."}
{"text":"Does the Camelback Corridor really need another fancy burger place? No.
 
But Zinburger is giving it a whirl anyway - with mixed results. I tried a Samburger, which comes with 1000 Island, applewood-smoked bacon, onions and usually mayonnaise (which I changed to Dijon mustard). The beef is excellent quality, and was actually cooked medium-rare as I asked. The buns are just right. The bacon is top-shelf. I'd prefer a thinner, wider patty to the beef puck Zinburger uses. And I'd like less grease. The bottom bun was saturated with enough lubricant to melt the rust off the hull of the Titanic. 
 
Now, about the sweet potato fries. Sweet potato fries are old news. They are the culinary equivalent of the phrase \"think outside the box.\" My suggestion? Kumara fries (and no, kumara is not just a sweet potato - they taste different). Or better yet, get really original and bake them rather than drowning them in oil. I'll also add that Smashburger's Smash Fries take Zinburger's sweet potato fries to the cleaners.
 
And this place needs some condiments. Each table, at minimum, needs ketchup and Sriracha. Mustard (preferably stone-ground or Dijon) would also be nice. I'd also dig Worecesteshire.
 
Finally, let's talk drinks. If you're going to do beers on tap, get away from Guinness and get bold - and really, $6.50 for a Guinness? This is not a super-premium brew. Four Peaks is a nice addition since they're local, and I credit Zinburger for that. But overall, the beer selection is a bunch of tepid, unoriginal retreads. The milkshakes look awesome. All the originality that could've gone into the beer selection wound up on the shake menu. I really have to go back and try the date shake. I won't say anything about the wine since I only vaguely care that it exists.
 
Bottom line - burger and fry-wise, not much new to see here. You can get burgers just as good (if not better) at Fez, Delux and even Parlor if you can bring yourself to not order a pizza there."}
{"text":"We have been to this location at least ten times, so obviously we are fans.  We have tried almost every burger on the menu at least once.  We have also sampled all of the side offerings.  We always order a Zucchini fries (with a side of the Truffle Aioli that comes with the truffle fries).  I am generally not a fan of vegetables disguising themselves as fries, but these are amazing.  Also, I am generally not a fan of $10.00 burgers and was pre-disposed to not like this place.  However, the burgers here are phenominal.  We can usually split one burger and one side (usually the green chile fries, but sometimes we venture out and try one of the others) and it is plenty for two of us (this is in addition to the aforementioned Zucchini fries, of course).  Our favorites are the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple (I even splurged once and got the Kobe style Plain and Simple - it was very good, but not good enough to justify the extra cost on a regular basis).  The onions on the Zinburger are braised in Zinfandel and very tasty.  Although I have not tried the Turkey burger, I have been told by several folks that have tried it that it is the best one they have tasted.  Flavorful and juicy.  
You should always find out what the burger of the day is - we have had some pretty amazing ones.
The shakes are also phenominal (although I prefer beer, I have tasted at least six different flavors of shakes and they were all outstanding).
The staff is great.  Very pleasant and generally attentive.  We did have one incident where our server apparently walked off after taking our drink orders, but once the management was made aware they were on top of it immediately (and stayed on top of it throughout our stay).  The management staff is very friendly and they are always walking around checking things out and making small talk with the patrons.
All in all, for a higher end burger place, this is a very good choice (we can usually get out for under $30.00 for the two of us if it isn't Happy Hour - even less during HH).  This is propably my favorite place in Old Town Gilbert."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and was able to try the Samburger and Zinburger. I enjoyed both because the burgers were cooked perfectly and the toppings were very tasty, I liked the Zinburger a little bit more. 

I did not care for the french fries though, they were very basic. And the desserts are huge, 2 people can definitely split 1. 

Service was terrific and I liked the set up the restaurant has with bar seating inside and out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was super relaxed and cool and had a good mixed crowd. I got the plain and simple burger and it was really tasty. I'm not usually a huge fan of buns but this one was pretty good! 

There were three of us so we ordered two baskets of fries to share. Fries are like my favorite thing and these were delicious! We got the regular ones and the Parmesan. The best thing ever is that they will bring the fries out ahead of time if you want while you're waiting on the burgers!"}
{"text":"Clean and chill environment. Feels homely. Ordered a zinburger on rare and it was cooked perfectly. Everything is ordered separately there is no combo deal so it was a bit pricey but very delicious! The aioli fries were crunchy. Also ordered a shake. It was smooth and thick. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"I'm adding one star for the desserts only, although I still think the shakes are priced too high. You don't even get an overflow cup like at most places. $6 per shake. 

Anyhoo, we went there for dessert last night and I got a slice of banana cream pie that could have fed a small army, and husband got the double-cocolate mint shake concoction. 

My pie was fabulous: real bananas, creamy filling, crunchy graham cracker crust, and mounds of whipped cream topped with caramel sauce. ooooooo yum! $5 for a giant slice. 

Husband said the shake was really good. Not mind-blowing. 

We'll stick with the desserts here after we've eaten better burgers somewhere else!"}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian, don't be afraid to try Zinburger.  Their veggie burger is fantastic!!!!  I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Whoa there, Bessie!

\"Aw\", looks at cow on the wall, \"thank you, thanks for these amazing burgers we're about to eat.\" - A fellow Zinburger diner

Much emotion, but definitely an important reminder to be thankful for the food we have and are able to consume. The lovely lady, was so endearing to openly say that and made me appreciate the fact I had a choice to sit down in the open restaurant of Zinburger. Definitely heard a lot about this place, but never made it around. However, after shopping around the Scottsdale Quarter and working up and appetite I finally got to dine-in!

Decided to go with the El Diablo, Double Truffle Fries to share and a pint of the Blue Paddle Pilsner. First off, spicy food lovers El Diablo is the way to go! Roasted Jalapenos with sweet, carmelized onions and Pepper Jack cheese it's savory, spicy and sweet goodness. The burger itself is pretty large and easily shareable, cooked to your liking and made with Angus. I ended up taking half of mine home. No burger is complete with a good ol' brew and loved the Pilsner with this one, it's crisp to cut through the richness of the burder yet rich enough to stand it's own. Lastly, the good ol' Double Truffle Fries ... hands down probably one of the best truffle fries I have ever had. Though they do not look remarkable and kind of reminiscent of the fries you get at Wingstop (stop judging, I actually like their fries) they are filled with such truffle goodness and topped with a healthy portion of grated Parm and don't get me started on that Truffle Aioli. I'm pretty sure that these were the reason I didn't finish my burger because I was too busy trying to inhale these in all it's glory.

Service was good, it wasn't too crowded so frequent checks were done. I did find my water cup to be dirty on the inside, but was corrected upon showing it to my waiter. The atmosphere had high ceilings, big tables and seating to accommodate large parties to even diners at the bar or out on the patio. Price point is steep for the burger here, then again I wouldn't classify these burgers are typical classics but more higher end- pushing gourmet style burgers, like they carry Kobe here, gourmet. Though, the burger was good was it $12 good? Not quite, I'd honestly grab their Truffle Fries, a brewski and leave (belly) happy."}
{"text":"Pros
1. One of the best veggie burgers I have eaten in PHX! They make their own veggie patties everyday apparently! Ah put the fried egg on it, & it will blow Ur mind. Yes u r welcome :)
2. Huge portions for the fries and shakes. We got zucchini tots & sweet potato fries. They were good. 
3. The salads look amazing as well, try em 
4. The ambience is good and service good, even if a tad slow 

Cons
1. No fries are included with the burger and this always gets to me, why should we pay more to get fries, common no burger is complete without the fries!! It's not like the burger is huge to be worth $10. When u order the fries though be careful it's huge, so better to share it with someone. 
2. The place is a bit on the expensive side for a burger place

All said I m coming back to get the veggie burger again. Love the places like these that are puttin effort into making the vegetarians happy as well"}
{"text":"Zinburger is very good. Not quite as good as Delux in the taste category (just by a tiny bit) but far superior overall experience due to an extremely friendly and helpful staff, and far far better seating comfort."}
{"text":"Had the el diablo burger and it was cooked to perfection. I did not like the zuchini fries.We sat outside at night and it was good atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have been to this Zinburger location countless times and they NEVER disappoint. Most times we are there with my niece who is 2 years old and all the waiters and employees are always so nice & friendly to our exploring little person that likes to travel to nearby tables and say \"Hello\"!! Our normal waiter is fantastic and probably has our regular order down-packed by now. The burgers are delicious - yes a little more pricey than your typical burger but WELL worth the $12 (on average) price tag! The fries are shareable and the Cobb salad is absolutely amazing! This is a great place for a super tasty burger, fun sides, and a bomb shake (my fav is the Oreo cookie shake!) The service is consistently great and the food is always on point - with burger patties always cooked to your specification!"}
{"text":"Delicious, joucy burger cooked perfectly and with tasty topics and bun.  Also enjoyed the fries (not over-or under-done as they tend to be many places) and the sour cherry margarita.  Helpful, prompt service in an airy, pleasant atmosphere.  Tables are well-spaced--not overly crowded."}
{"text":"Nice!  Totally impressed by fine burgers; rightly portioned along with great sides.  We enjoyed the truffle fries ordering several for the entire party.  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich.. tasty and spicy without being overly spicy.  The chicken breast was tender and juicy a pleasant experience.  Topped off by a super-thick Butterfinger shake.  Wow..."}
{"text":"I am still reeling from my lunch here, dreaming about it, planning my next trip. I don't know what else to say other than I was totally surprised by how fantastic my lunch was. A Zinburger with truffle fries. Sat at the bar by myself, was on my way to the airport. Wasn't that hungry. I thought about taking the napkin to remember the place by. I don't know what you could find wrong with these burgers, truthfully one of the best I've ever shoved in my piehole."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town and great service!! Came here for lunch with my sister and didn't have to wait at all (very nice since every where else in downtown Gilbert had a long wait).  I had the el Diablo and it was by far the best burger I have had around town. My sister ordered a bacon burger and it was just as delicious!! The fries were great and can be shared between two people.  Our waitress was as good as the food haha ... She was fast, helpful, and friendly. Will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Zinburger quite a few times and have always left happy. My favorite is the Zinburger, with an addition of bacon because bacon really does make it better. The Samburger is also really good, but I think the Zinburger is much more flavorful. I haven't tried the veggie burger, but friends I've dined with have had it and loved it.
They always have a special burger of the week too, and they usually sound pretty good. But I am a creature of habit and have yet to try one.

Side dish-wise, I've tried the regular fries, truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini fries. The truffle fries are amazing! I really enjoy the sweet potato and zucchini fries too, especially the tangy yogurt dipping sauce that comes with them. But the regular fries are super disappointing... you would think a burger place with several delicious different types of fries would at least have good ol' regular french fries. Unfortunately, the ones I've tried have been soggy and not very flavorful. Regardless of what you get, the sides are huge and can easily be split between 2-3 people.

I can't imagine having room to order a shake too, but they all look delicious, I might have to give in one day. My boyfriend did get the root beer float one night, and I definitely stole a few (several) bites. If you can somehow manage to save room for it, get it! Or do it as he did and order it as an \"appetizer.\"

I've heard some complaints about the wine, but I always order the Tilia. It's only $6 and if you like cabs or malbecs, you'll definitely enjoy it. For beer drinkers, they have a limited tap selection, but they are all good craft beers. 

Yes, it may be a little pricier than your average burger joint, but I guarantee it's better quality too. 

Although, I could do without the cows on the wall watching me eat their friends. Sorry cows! Please don't judge me... you just taste so good!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for the very first time with a couple of our good friends. We had the kale Caesar, the Kobe Burger, hand Fries and the IPA Beer and Berry Mojito. Everything was delicious! The fools was phenomenal, the drinks were tasty and the service was over all great!we had an outdoor table and the atmosphere was very hip and easy going. Great Job Sam Fox! I look fwd to visiting all your restaurants now!"}
{"text":"Well where do I start .the place is loaded with tvs the atmosphere is great I got seated right away but I have to tell you for $10 a burger they need some help .  The turkey burger was cold at first bite and it had no zing to it ..I'm willing to give it another shot but it will be a while ..the fries were good tho"}
{"text":"UPDATE!
So I was contacted by management after my last review in an attempt to remedy my mediocre experience. Which I respect, any kind of business that reaches out to dissatisfied customers to attempt to fix their problems is awesome. That being said, I have also never gone into a restaurant with the sole purpose of a review, so this was a first for me. 

I decided this time around I would just go hang at the bar and really assess the food and ambiance as best I can. 
With the exception of some extremely loud drunk people next to me (not the business's fault) the bar was great. The bartenders were awesome, and attentive. I went in around 8 so it was pretty quiet. Service this time was much, much better. 

I decided to go the \"build your own burger\" route and I got a burger with American cheese, bacon, roasted peppers, onion rings and thousand island on it and a side of fries. Seemed simple enough. The food came out in a timely fashion this time, another good sign. I took my first bite and really tasted the peppers and onion rings. It was cooked perfectly just how I ordered it. But I felt something was missing, and there were some things missing. No bacon or thousand island. Seems like something small, but forgetting 2/4 things I ordered on my burger is kind of a big deal. 

I am in no way a picky person but it just didn't sit well with me. Had the burger come out with all of the stuff I ordered on it, I could easily see this being a 4 star update instead of a 3. That being said. I will be giving ZinBurger one final shot sometime in the next week or so."}
{"text":"Another one of Fox Concept's great restaurants. Great food, great service, great location. 

Casual, but quality dining. Go on a nice day and sit at the bar. Bar is set up to bring outdoors in. Servers are helpful, kobe burger is done just right and wine selection always has something interesting. Bartenders will provide helpful recommendations and they are happy to offer tastings. After dining, go explore Shops at Biltmore; apple store, pottery barn, saks, William-Sonoma, Ralph Lauren. Sit in the very nicely landscaped and large grass quadrangle and just people watch. Dog friendly area. Very nice way to spend an afternoon or evening."}
{"text":"Zinburger....eh, it's alright. I can't help but think about how much I liked Delux way more. It's not a bad burger but I ordered the El Diablo Kobe burger and failed to see what was so special. I paid an extra $5 for it to be Kobe and was excited to taste the difference, and honestly neither me or my bf were able to tell. I was also excited about the truffle fries (since they are my favorite fries at The Yard House), but they turned out to be mediocre also. They have great aiolli sauces but that was the only thing that really stood out. Its a nice setting, very clean and classy, we were able to watch some college football from our booth. I would eat here again if a friend wanted to go, but otherwise I will probably go elsewhere next time I want a gourmet burger."}
{"text":"Have the buffalo chicken burger and it was awesome. Love their shakes. I don't typically order shake but they have a great selection and I have the butterfingers last night . It's a must when I come to Phoenix"}
{"text":"Love Zinburger! The burgers/sandwiches are huge! And one serving of fries feeds two! The butterfingers shake is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Our waiter knew his wines and I was pretty happy with the one I got. I love a burger joint where I can order wine with my burger. Fries with truffle oil and parmesan were delicious. Zucchini fries were interesting and good too. I got the Kobe beef burger, medium rare, with grilled onions and the regular suggested toppings. Very delicious and juicy. One of the best burgers I've had. Totally worth paying more for the Kobe beef than the regular stuff, and though I haven't tried the regular stuff I was more than satisfied with the Kobe. Their milkshakes bring the boys and girls to the yard, too. No room for dessert unfortunately."}
{"text":"It's trendy and pricey. The gourmet burger joint thing is getting to be a bit much. But, the food here is pretty darn good. We got zucchini fries (awesome) turkey sloppy joe and veggie burgers. Everything was fantastic, service was great. Wasn't a fan of the non-gender bathrooms, or the fact that the burgers don't come with a side. Otherwise a really great experience."}
{"text":"I had the Kobe Burger, my lady had the El Diablo Burger, shared some loaded fries and a Banana Royale Shake. The food was delicious but the Kobe burger was a little pricey. The shake was one of the best I've had. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Solid spot to check out to cure the occasional burger and french fry craving.  Recommend the trying the turkey burger (I usually hold the mayo and sprouts) - very flavorful and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Ok, so I didn't actually go and have a burger. This review is more a testament to their lacking service. The food was pretty good, once we actually GOT IT! 

My date and I each ordered a salad. It's a good thing we were both engrossed in conversation. If I had been there by myself waiting for my greens to come out, I probably would have gotten up and left. I would guestimate that it took a good 45 minutes for salad--stuff that doesn't even need to really be cooked---to come out to our table (Ok, I got the seared Ahi tuna salad, but come on, how much actual cooking time is involved??) And the sad thing was, it wasn't even THAT busy, so I don't understand why our order took so long. 

The wait was just ridiculous for what we ordered. I could understand if we ordered a rack of lamb (which is not on the menu), but salad? Come on! Somebody is really dropping the ball on the service there. 

I don't know who's in charge, but they really need to light a fire underneath their waitstaff."}
{"text":"This place is great!! The food is great and the service is great. My wife and I took our kids here for dinner. It was a busy Friday night and there was a wait. While we were waiting we grabbed a few drinks and an appetizer from the bar. When we received our food, everyone loved it! Our kids said it was the best burger they've ever tasted. My wife and I agreed. Everything from the buns to the ingredients were fantastic. They were big and there was no question that the meat was of higher quality. We knew the price was going to be a little higher than a regular burger restaurant and it was sooooo worth it!! Our server, Dominic was great and Cole, the manager on duty, took great care of us while we waited for a table (and after) even though it was very busy. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. I like the Sam burger and my husband usually gets the Kobe burger. Loaded fries are amazing!!! Total gut bomb but worth it! It's a great place for the kiddos but also a great place to grab a beer with friends and watch a game."}
{"text":"Price to taste ratio is pretty high, yet overall, fairly solid burger and fries."}
{"text":"Really cool architecture. Feels like a barn but cooler cleaner and much more comfortable. Happy with the selection of wines and craft beers. I opted for the hard cider. Ordered the green chili fries. Burgers don't come with sides however so I tried the zinburger with extra pickles. It was a little tepid when served though, I would have preferred a hot burger. This may have had something to do with how cool it was in the dining room. I had to take it home in a box because I was so full from the fries! If you're in downtown Gilbert and want a delicious gourmet burger, Zinburger is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the place was packed... Luckily we got sat right away at the bar. The service was quick and the zinburger was juicy and delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"AMANING! I'd give them 10 stars if I could!  I've been waiting for the newness to die down so we didn't have to wait an hour to be seated, so now they didn't have much of a wait!!! 

The staff is on point! We had a kind and funny waiter that was super helpful.

The burgers are awesome!  I got the one with a fried egg on top... I couldn't believe how awesome the flavor was.  You have to try it!  
We HAD to get a shake as well, so I got the Nutella crunch and it was off the charts. 

I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Been here three times or so. I was really impressed by the veggie burger the first time I came and the farm salad the second time... But the third time I got the farm salad again and the portion was smaller (I got half size both times) and it just wasn't as good. I also ordered the zucchini fries, which I love but the portions were a lot smaller on my third trip, too... Also on this third trip, the chefs forgot to include avocado for my salad and two other people at my table. They also forgot the avocado on my first trip, too. So I guess watch out for the missing avocado. Hesitant to go back after a poor experience my third time... But the first two times were good...."}
{"text":"Courteous staff and really good burger. It's not the best burger I've ever had(reason for the 4 stars) but it's pretty close."}
{"text":"Honestly this was a complete disappointment. I live right by here and I'm a HUGE burger and fries lover. To start off calling them was a nightmare, it was a 45 minute wait so my husband and I decided to order out. Called them was told to hold a few minutes and held almost 10 then finally someone picked me back and says I'm sorry please hold again, and after 2 minutes finally someone answered. Ordered the plain burger and the one with red hot, fries, onion rings, and a salted caramel shake. Asked to be cooked medium well... I love a medium steak, but not ground beef. Any who, I go to pick it up and wait at the bar about 5 mins for someone to acknowledge me. Finally someone does and it's another 20 mins before my foods out. Finally I have my food...oh wait, where is my shake?? Have to wait for them to make it. Now to the actual taste. 

Burgers were mediocre at best, totally undercooked, red throughout. Onion rings are shriveled up sad excuses for onion rings, and fries were just okay. All the fried items had the gross oil after taste like the oil was dirty and ready to be changed. And finally the SALTY caramel shake, I mean salted caramel, which would be better titled the carameled salt shake. PURE SALT is all I tasted. Literally gagging trying to drink it. And the best part, almost $50 tab! 

Extremely disappointed and I think once it loses that new place in now popularity, it will not be so busy unless some real changes are made."}
{"text":"First time eating here and the hamburger was flawless! I thought my meal would be a bit heavy afterwards because beef usually is. But this hamburger was not. Only reason I give it a 4stars because it was 12.00 just for my hamburger. That didn't include a drink or fries. I have ate at other similar restaurants and usually 1 side is included in the meal. I think a side should be offered or a small appetizer while waiting. I probably would only go back if its on a date night movies and dinner. There are plenty of hamburger places in my location that are a little more reasonable. Although the food was yummy I was hoping I found a \"wow\"factor here but didn't. Give it a try . Its worth a try."}
{"text":"I love the food here! The shakes are to die for! Fried green beans so good! Burgers are fantastic. Still long waits if you are not careful."}
{"text":"Good shakes.  Service was very friendly, but not very attentive.  Medium rare showed no signs of the medium, but lots of rare."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly and the food comes out fast... which is great around lunch time.  The food was delicious... I got the Zinburger and hand-cut fries but something still seems odd about paying $10 for a hamburger. P.S.  

There is a trick to parking here, you need to go to the parking area with the gates and push a button to get a coin which you take inside the restaurant and get validated.  

Overall I'm a fan and I'll be back someday."}
{"text":"If you think making a reservation will get you in sooner,Think again. I made a reservation for 5:30pm on Saturday thru open table. We were told they were just cleaning out table up. The woman even pointed out the table. Then someone else was seated. 20 minutes go by and they are telling me we can sit outside. I had put on the open table I wanted inside and a low table. I told them no to outside so I was told I have to wait some more. I was trying not to get upset but then someone who was waiting went up to the seater. And then she motioned for him and sat them down. I then went and asked why do you take reservations if they do not mean anything? I was told that there are many people waiting and I would have to wait with them. This is when I asked for the manager. She apologized and said they were cleaning up a table for us now. I told her this is nuts how they treat the people who make reservations and that they shouldn't offer them if this is the case. The manager sat us down but never offered us anything to make it right. I waited 35 minutes after my reservation to be seated. And then the sever never asked us if we wanted more drinks. Food was great. But they need to retrain everyone in this place. I even told them we were here for a birthday and nothing was done. Not sure I will be back.

******UPDATE******
The general manager reached out to me right away and apologized. That is how great management should be. I don't like to complain. But I try to give constructive criticism. Thanks for doing your best to make this right."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, and both times the food was amazing. Have tried the Samburger and Bruce Lee Burger so far, neither of which disappointed. The Truffle Fries are also fantastic.

10/10 burgers, will be back."}
{"text":"So, I might be one of the few that decided to get the ahi tuna sandwich instead of the burgers for my first visit. Since I was not starving, I did not think I would be able to tackle the gigantic burger I saw across the bar from me. 

The tuna was perfect. It was easily an inch and half thick, seared perfectly with plenty of avocado slices to make it the best fish sandwich I have ever had! 

This is going to make for a tough decision the next time I go and try to order a burger. 

Great Job!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are a decent size and have good flavor. The side dishes are large enough to share. We got the onion rings and fries. Onion rings have a nice crispy texture and the fries are cooked well. Not to crispy or to soggy. The beer selection is limited, but is a nice environment and the service was good."}
{"text":"Sorry Zinburger but Deluxe still makes a better burger; I'm giving you 2.5 stars for now, but I'll give it another shot in a few months.  I think you need some time to work out the kinks.

Rating Breakdown:

Atmosphere:  3.5 Stars, Typical FoxRC, clean good aesthetics with a well defined style.  The trendy airy bar feel is nice, but the music is blaring way too loud (reminiscent of AZ88).  The patio seating is quieter and provides for good people watching.

Food: 2 Stars, Inconsistent and lacking flavor.  Opening week problems?  Maybe... Hopefully the food will be better on my next visit.

** ZinBurger: Came out cooked to a perfect medium rare, very impressed.  The meaty flavor was good - the bun was boring.  Nothing exceptional. $10

** Kobe Burger: Ordered medium rare, came out rare.  Kobe tartar!  Gross! Even if this burger was cooked properly I doubt that it would have been worth $14.  Cheddar cheese and mushrooms... snooze!  I thought this was a fancy burger shop?

** Buffalo Chicken Sandwich:  This was the best part of our meal.  Flavorful and satisfying, but really how hard is it to cook a chicken breast and toss it in hot wing sauce?  I'm pretty sure I would be just as happy ordering the same item from Chilli's or Applebees. $10

** Double Truffle Fries:  Soggy, oily, and over salted.  Yuck!  The truffle oil flavor was there and the fries had potential, but I just couldn't get past the soggy oily salty mess. $6

** Zucchini Fries:  These are just fried zucchini cut into a steak fry shape instead of the normal zucchini rounds.   Nothing special, in fact I think I prefer the fried zucchini from Carl's Jr.  $6

Drinks: 3 Stars, Full bar, eight beers on tap and eight additional bottled selections.  *** A little rant:  If I'm going to dine in a place that is charging me $25 for a burger, fries, & a beer I would expect filtered water at the table.  Sorry, but at this price point City of Phoenix tap water, that tastes like it came from my backyard pool, just doesn't cut it!

Service: 2 Stars, Lots of waitresses running around frantically, but ours seemed to be MIA for most of the meal.

Conclusion:  Save your money and time.  Run up to Deluxe instead, or better yet skip the trendy and head over to Two Hippies for a great burger, fries, and a Shasta drink for $5."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever tasted. The bread is toasted to a crispy-yet-soft perfection. Always bursting with flavor, and always cooked exactly as I ordered. They have unique combinations of burger ingredients, and I try to order a different burger every time. They've all been amazing. The zucchini fries are fresh with the perfect amount of breading and sprinkle of parmesan cheese...too much for one person. Get them to share! Don't go into this place expecting fast-casual...it's definitely an eat-in or (call ahead and) pick-up restaurant. The price is a little higher than I usually like to pay for just a burger (you pay separate for a side of fries). But every so often, a splurge on this burger is worth it."}
{"text":"Good place for a burger and shake

Lots of burger options with novel flares.  Meat is cooked perfectly to order.  However, I found the Kobe Burger bland.  Fries are a side you purchase and the Double Truffles were only okay.  The Salt and Caramel shake was way too overpowering.  It made me gag a little with so much butter/sugar flavor.  

My wife, who would lick caramel and sea salt from an industrial mixer if she could, even coughed at the intensity of the shake.  And our little girl wasn't a fan of the cheeseburger and fries.  

Maybe we caught Zinburger off its game.  We'll have to try it again in the future to see."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there is a Zinburger in Gilbert now. We went to the pre-opening dinner, and had a fabulous time. I had the watermelon mojito, which was a very refreshing drink. We shared the green chill fries as an appetizer. They were decent. I tasted more chipotle aioli than green chilies. My burger was called \"My Boy Blue\" and it was perfectly cooked and delicious. The mister had the \"Samburger\" which is his favorite at Zinburger. We can't wait to go back and try the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with my family. Kids meals with shakes 5 dollars split my meal with my wife. The even split the shake ."}
{"text":"I got the ZInburger, and have never tasted anything like it.  So good!  A friend and I split the burger and split fries (regular fries).  They were shoestring fries and looked overcooked, but no fears...they were crunchy on the outside and perfectly soft on the inside.  How do they do that?  The waitress was about 12 (ok, she was probably 21 but very young looking and perky) and she was friendly, attentive, helpful and not at all \"Scottsdale snobbish\".  We each had a different ice cream shake, and they were ok.  But the burger and fries made us true believers in ZInburger."}
{"text":"the best food.  the server that is great is justin, and the manager barry(female)  try the coffee latte shake and ask for hagan dazs coffee ice cream to make it with, the place is amazing.  

not for kids."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, service and the food was stellar! One of my favorite nights of our stay in the Phoenix area was at this place!!  The memories of my Zinburger haunt my dreams...YUM!!"}
{"text":"The burger of the week was the Impossible burger, the new all plant burger that bleeds, tastes and looks like a meat burger.  I had this burger and it was OUTSTANDING.  Got it done in the classic diner version and I thought I was eating a regular meat burger. 

Zucchini fries and farm salad also excellent.  Can't wait to go back.

Also, I really appreciate the fact that they now take reservations."}
{"text":"They took away the Kobe burger!!! That was the best one. The other burgers suck. No reason to go now. I'm not waiting to be seated all day just for a shitty burger."}
{"text":"Food is always great but we are getting tired of the slow customer service.  The last few times, regardless of the time of day, it's been 10 minutes before someone stops at the table.   When you sit down, someone should come introduce themselves and let you know it will be a few minutes.  The hostess can bring you some water at least.  Seems like no one knows who's got what table.  Makes it hard to come here with kids or when you are hungry.  Ordered some ice tea - no one brought sugar to the table.  Ordered glass of wine, still hasn't come to the table and it's been 10 minutes.  Mind you its 2pm and there are at least 5 servers here.

Addendum:  The manager came by and we were able to speak to her and discuss some of our experiences.  She brought us a dessert and a gift card which was very gracious.  Again, the food is always excellent. The customer service just needs to match it.  Kudos to Fox restaurants for caring about their customers."}
{"text":"I dined here once before and I wasn't too impressed, granted I don't eat red meat so it's not exactly fair for me to be reviewing a burger joint, right? So rather than writing a review on the turkey burger I once had I decided to forgo it, BUT my coworkers and I just went back recently and have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my meal! 

I ordered the Blanco Burger with turkey and the spicy ass Chipotle sauce on the side (thank heavens) and it was VERY good! Turkey burgers are often lackluster and dry, not getting much attention I feel, but I was impressed and would definitely return for it. Yum yum yum! AND it was on a potato bun! Goodness gracious I love potatoes so when the waiter told me it was a potato bun I was sold!

I also must say that the open, airy feel of their restaurant is great and the patio is nice as well. I actually like that it's separated from the restaurant.

Two thumbs up, Zin! Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The reason why I'm giving Zin a rating of one star is solely because of the horrendous service, and also the kitchen cannot read a ticket correctly. Or the kitchen does not know what rare, medium rare, medium, and well done is.   The other reason why am rating this this low is because this just hasn't happened once it's happened four out of the five times we have gone (also with horrible service) but trust me there won't be a sixth. When a customer orders their bison medium rare and the server confirms and explains that there is a warm red center it shouldnt come out well done TWICE and completely gray over cooked meat throughout. But don't get me wrong when the kitchen does it correctly the food is outstanding but the servers definitely need some serious work and pay attention to their tables not ignore the tables and play games  card games by the bar. Maybe yelp should have two separate ratings one for service and one for the food I think that'll help businesses out tremendously and give a true ratings. I guess if I want Their burgers I just have to go to the other location."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries and shakes in a casual environment at the Biltmore shopping center. I've never had a burger here I didn't like and everything is always cooked to perfection! However I did have a friend join me recently who ordered the turkey burger and reported that it was the worst thing she's ever had in her life... but for me I love this place!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice, bright and open. We ordered the no buns turkey burger and a half farm salad with chicken. The chicken was dried but the salad was atill good. The turkey pattie was moist."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but I always enjoy it when I go. Great flavors, big portions! Can't understand why people are so upset about the pricing. Some people just don't get that you are paying for the quality of the meat. If you want a $1 burger injected with hormones and GMO's, go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"Tonight the Jolly Diner's transported to Zinburger. For appetizers we had the zucchini fries without Parmesan or Ranch (I'm vegan) and the onion rings with BBQ sauce. Appetizers delicious! Then came the entrees... My sister and I had the veggie burger and my mom had a piece of chicken with cottage cheese, a lettuce wedge and tomatoes. Meals and plates were expertly prepared, the atmosphere is trendy with nice music, flat screen televisions, and a nice bar. Our waiter was professional and attentive to our needs. We had a great meal. The Jolly diners rated Zinburger a five out of five dining experience. It's a place you can take your family or a date for a nice meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was about to dine at Zinburger tonight when the waiter assigned to my table kept rubbing and touching his nose (no, I am not joking). Upon leaving, I advised him not to do that because he is serving people food and touching/ rubbing your nose is promoting germs."}
{"text":"Simple but trendy little burger joint. The double sided outdoor open bar adds a nice ambience to this place. The burger I ordered was delicious, a messy monstrosity called simply \"Breakfast,\" which with an egg and avocado combined two of my favorite meals: breakfast and burger. Service was good and this place had a laid back sleepy diner feel. My only gripe: if you are going to make a delicious burger, a regular hamburger bun seems out of place. Try a toasted Kaiser roll or something else unique, like for a sandwich called \"Breakfast\" perhaps two pieces of toast."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! I've been a few times. I've eaten in and done take out. 

The breakfast burger is awesome. The fried zucchini and onion rings were okay. The Nutella shake is good. 

I got the banana cream pie to go. It was is amazing. The crust was the best part. But the rest of it was really good too. However it did look like a mess in the togo box. 

The chicken sandwich was really tasty and they didn't skimp on the avocado. The green chili fries hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful service.  Definitely worth a visit.  Very modern.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I dined here on a work function with about 10 other colleagues. Service was brisk and friendly. We ordered several orders of fries and rings, and they were delivered promptly and were quite tasty. I had the namesake burger which was pretty good and nicely cooked (medium rare). The bun was a bit mediocre and added nothing to the experience, but the meat and toppings were quite nice.

A colleague of mine did order a well done burger, and hers came out perfectly rare. That was probably their biggest misstep of the evening.

Overall a good place to grab some grub and some wine if in the area."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and the place just looks amazing. Very well presented and clean. The staff was super friendly and helpful. There was minimal wait for drinks and food. 
I ordered the Blanco burger and it was absolutely amazing!! Whatever chipotle mayo they use, it is spicy. But the good kind. Definitely going back to try a different burger."}
{"text":"I'll make this brief- if you want incredible food in a great location, go here. Just keep in mind the wait will be long! You can get placed in line with No Wait (sweet deal) but once your at a table, it will be a long wait. While the food is very good, our sweet potato fries took almost 30 minutes to come out. However, the burgers were incredible. Pricing is a bit high, but the food is worth it. Overall, good food, long wait."}
{"text":"The forgot my fucking egg on my breakfast burger! ($10.50) For 10.50 you should be getting a burger with an egg. A good egg at that. An organic cage free egg I suppose."}
{"text":"Amazing unique burgers, gluten free buns available, and great wine and beer selection. We come here often and enjoy every time!"}
{"text":"These burgers pack a wallop. Seriously.  They are big, fresh, succulent, juicy, tender, and melt in your mouth, with the different textures of the toppings (depending on what you get) all perfectly complementing the meat.  Can't say enough about this place.. while there's something to be said about the bun (can get a little soggy on the bottom), this is definitely the best burger joint in the valley.  Get it medium-rare for the full tender experience, and an order of five guys-like fries (same lightness to it, but is crispier and fresher).  Plus a Sierra Nevada.  You won't regret it.

I do find myself occasionaly feeling a twang of guilt looking at the big happy cow in the field of greens on the back wall... but that instantly subsides after taking a bite out of a burger."}
{"text":"Food was great,  not sure why everyone loves zucchini fries, but sweet potato fries rocked! I highly recommend the 20oz. Kilt Lifter brew! Awesome breakfast burger! Even ran I to friends from Chicago!  Can't wait to return. Great staff.  Hostess was so sweet and Danielle our server was perfect!"}
{"text":"It's a very expensive place to get a burger, but the burgers are good. The restaurant is usually very busy and location is ideal in the Gilbert Heritage District. Service was good, but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"\"It is better to look good, than to serve good. . . \" 

First of all, the burgers are very good. I ordered mine medium, and that's how it actually arrived. Not many places will actually cook a burger to order. Maybe they SAY they will, but no. The fries (both sweet potato and regular) were tasty. So no real complaints about the food.

But . . . COME ON Sam Fox. . . you can't just put model-looking women out there as servers and hostesses, have them take far too long to seat us because they couldn't figure out which tables were open, deny that a special was being offered (until I showed the email for it on my phone),  have them take 10 minutes or so to bring a glass of wine, delay a simple food order by about 20 minutes or so, repeatedly neglect water and drink refills, forget that the burger was ordered without a bun, and expect customers not to notice because they've been blinded by an abundance of voluptuary feminine goodness. I've gotten better service at actual stripjoints that served food. 

So, not really a fan. Maybe caught them on a bad night (though the Tuesday night crowd didn't seem like it would have been too imposing). I might give them another chance, but then if I'm paying $11 for a burger ala carte, basically everything needs to be perfect to convince me to go back. Smashburger and 5 Guys are just down the street, and I'd rather not pay for the pretention of service."}
{"text":"The burger and loaded fries were amazing. The customer service was top notch as well.  We can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Managers here are phenomenal.  Customer service is great and our waitress, Kayleigh,  has a great personality and is very helpful. Must go if in downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and loaded fries topped off with a great milk shake:) yum. Try the breakfast burger it is loaded with a over easy egg and bacon. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Wine + burger for dinner? That sounded so good!

We actually went back to Scottsdale Quarter for dinner because I wanted to have wine with my burger.

I ended up getting Angry Orchard instead of wine because I am a fan of this hard cider. 

House made onion ring ($6.00): served with BBQ sauce, the rings were tasty, crispy and surprisingly not greasy. 

Zinburger ($10.50):  manchego cheese, Zinfadel braised onions, lettuce & mayo. Paired with drunken onion slices, the cheesy beef patty was pretty yummy.

Samburger ($12.00): applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, lettuce, 1000 island. The Samburger was also equally as delicious as Zinburger.

Pickle slices were served on the side of your burger.  

The worker was very nice and helpful.

4 stars!!

Zinburger is yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"Ok, this is a Sam Fox dissapointment for sure. I am not the biggest fan of his restauraunts but some of them are decent like Culinary Dropout or Olive and Ivy, but this place is just ehh. First off, it is outrageusly overpriced. $13 bucks for a sub par burger without fries. If you add fries and get a milkshake or beer your talking a $25 meal for a hamburger, thats not that good. Also, what is up with the decor? Why would anyone want to eat a burger surrounded by walls painted with cows all over them? WTF. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after hearing so much about it.  We were a table of 6 and all of our burgers were cooked to perfection.  Our service was awesome.  They were attentive and went out of their way to make us feel welcomed.  It was definitely one of the better burgers I have had in the valley. My only complaint was I had to eat it with a fork and knife because it was to juicy.  The chopped wedge salad, bacon Bloody Mary and rings are all worth ordering.  Usually in a table of 6 someone is going to get a bad meal.... not this time.  Thanks"}
{"text":"I love this place. Simple menu, great burgers. A bit pricey but the quality was well worth the dollars. The zucchini fries were delicious and the sauce that came with it paired well. Must return soon. Service with a smile."}
{"text":"Zinburger is a quick, delicious stop for lunch! Although they're known for the undoubtedly delicious burgers, I always get a mouth watering shake and loaded French Fries. Makes me feel like I'm getting that classic diner feeling! The service is always quick and friendly. I highly suggest stopping in for your next lunch break!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but the only thing standing between my 3 rating and a 5 rating was $5. 

I knew that hitting a place in Biltmore wasn't going to be a frugal experience, and I was cool with that. I'll pay more for good food. but I have to admit that I have a really hard time paying $10 for a burger that doesn't come with ANY sort of side. And fries? Yeah, those are $5. And I realize a lot of places charge $12 or $13 for good, upscale burgers and Zin's combined cost isn't far off of that, but it just feels rip-off-y. 

(Note To Restaurant: if you bumped up burger prices $3 & gave 1/2 the amount of fries, you'd prob get better feedback from customers PLUS bump up your margin. It's really just perception.)

That said, I have to say, the burger was freaking delicious. I got the Diablo burger, piled high with roasted jalepenos and carmelized onions, and it really was amazing. The burger itself was cooked & seasoned perfectly. The sweet potato fries were also very good. Not a fan of the yogurt sauce that comes with them, but whatever.

Interestingly, their wine prices aren't half bad. I had a very tasty malbec / syrah blend for $6. That's not too shabby, as it seems many places less expensive than this are charging more.

Bottom line - great \"splurge\" place if I'm in the 'hood & have a craving. Not a regular place for me."}
{"text":"I got the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and a side of sweet potato fries. There was nothing special about the meal, just a slab of chicken on a bun. You can do much better at half the price almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome location with plenty of seating inside and out. Hostess and waiter were great. Our waiter took us through the menu and explained that the burgers don't come with a side. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich which is crispy. It was very good. As a side, I ordered onion rings and they were deliciously well done. I also tried the fries which are tasty. Great happy hour specials.

Excellent service by EJ!"}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious fresh and tasty. I ordered a regular cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg. The green chili fries were spicy but good. The Nutella shake and chocolate cake were also very good. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The store was also very clean."}
{"text":"My brother and mom absolutely love this place, as done my extended Phoenix family. It's a very bright and cool restaurant. I loved the all-white walls and ceiling, especially with our lunchtime being on a sunny day. I thought since we arrived around 2/230 that it'd be dead and we could walk in with no wait - I was wrong! I guess Arizonans like to lunch late. The wait wasn't bad at all which gave me time to peruse the menu. 
We sat outside, right under a heater, but it would've been nice to have another. 
Our server was sweet and on-point. She made sure we were taken care of!
She suggested the Double Truffle fries as a starter. They were meh - we would've been fine without them. Get the Sweet Potato fries instead. 
All 3 burgers came out amazing! I didn't try my mom's and brother's, but they loved them. My Blanco Burger was messy - use a fork & knife instead of trying to eat it with a bun. I can't wait to return and try another."}
{"text":"First time here, I have to say it was DELISH! 
My husband and I got the Bianco burger it was cooked to perfection they offer a more expensive burger patty which in my opinion is not necessary it's very flavorful already. The other couple ordered the blue cheese and BBQ burger, all yummy! The \"truffle\" potato fries were disappointing esp for the price,  my friends got the sweet potato fries - All I have to say is Thank God They Share!!!  (YUMMY... best I've had).
The place is at the Biltmore plaza surrounded by lots of ritzy restaurants and shops it makes for a  nice walk around after a meal. 
Our server was polite enough, could've been more helpful but in this neck of the woods that's better than some.
Don't know how the wine selection is I was in the mood for a good brew, choices were next to nil - a few IPA's and a couple of boring standards. They don't have a happy hour here just in case you were curious. Let's see..... over all was a good experience but won't replace our fav. for awesome burgers, beer battered fries and a great beer selection it's back to Four Peaks Brewing Co!"}
{"text":"Good food but horrible horrible horrible service,  don't recommend this place at all!!!  Even one star it's to much for this  place!!  The staff brought a check when we didn't ask for one. It seemed like they asked us to leave."}
{"text":"In the mood for a good hamburger we visited Zinburger last week, and had the Kobe Burger and truffle fries. The Truffle Aoli offered with the truffle fries was a little much, so I tasted it in very small quantities.

The Kobe Burger with mushrooms was superb- a great burger! It might have moved to my #1 spot over Delux for hamburger's. We also had the bacon cheeseburger- again - fantastic! 

The price is not for the faint of heart. $40 for two hamburgers and fries with iced tea for a beverage is a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with a girlfriend, was seated outside due to 20 minute wait for inside table. I was pleased that there were heaters and a fireplace that kept it comfortable since the weather was crisp. Down side was the seating, cold hard metal chairs, no cushions. After the hostess seated us, we looked over the menu's and waited 15 minutes for waitress one to come to and get our drink orders. A different person brought our drinks out. Then we sat and talked, we waited again for 20 minutes to place our burger orders with waitress #2. My friend went with the grass fed and I went with the blue cheese angus (don't remember exact name). My friend made it clear she wanted no blood with her burger, so she ordered medium well, she specified only a small amount of pink. I ordered medium for my burger. Both waitress informed us of the weekly special and both reiterated how each burger is made fresh to order. 
     So, 5 minutes after ordering these \"freshly made burgers\", ours came out, brought out by a different person not our waitress. I know it takes longer to make a burger fresh...My burger looked great, there was cartelized onions falling off of it and a decent amount of bleu cheese. I got right into it. All the burgers come on a potato bun or you can order gluten free...I got the regular bun. That paper wafer bun was worthless at holding that burger together for even the first bite...yep that damn thing fell apart. What could have saved that bun was if they actually toasted it...but nope it died on first bite. I went on with my sloppy sandwich, i tasted the onions and a bite of blue cheese, but the actual burger had absolutely NO flavor....none. Yes I could tell by the texture I was eating a burger but it had no beefy flavor..In and Out burger has better burger flavor!!! I ate my whole burger because I suffer from constant hunger and the over 30 minute wait made me ravenous. It was cooked as I ordered. 
    My dear friend, cut into her burger and noted red not pink and blood the opposite of what she ordered, she was too hungry as well to wait or return it for another. She ate half of her burger and did not like it at all, she was disgusted by the texture and the lack of flavor. She played with the idea of taking the other half home since its a $15 burger but did not in the end.
   Waitress #2 NEVER came to check on us after our food was brought out, she came 25 minutes after we were done after my friend flagged her down for the check, no drink refills, nothing offered. It was $29.11 for two burgers ONLY, no fries or sides-those are extra, we drank water. We gave the waitress #2 $40 cash and asked for singles with change. The waitress came back with ten singles, and said your change is $10. My friend said ok, do you want 0.11 cents then...so you can give me the other $1. The waitress replied, we don't carry change (as in coins) so thats why I gave you $10. So the basically the waitress took it upon herself to short change us....nice practice to get tips I guess. We tipped her non-waiting table, short changing, self $2...that was not even deserved. 
   Overall, I would never come here again, the service was terrible. The food was not worth the price, there are better FRESHLY MADE burger places. The atmosphere was meh, seating is not comfortable and its barn yard decor is nothing special to see. I would NOT recommend if you want to eat somewhere in downtown Gilbert, there are better places to check out. No kids menu btw, I always look."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour. Great food and prices zini burgers and zucchini fries are the perfect size and the milk shakes and the drinks are to die for and don't forget the banana cream pie. Yum"}
{"text":"I thought I'd kick the Labor Day weekend off with some burger and fries at Zinburger.  What'd I think?  Hmmm....

Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix on E. Camelback Road in what seemed like the business district of Phoenix though I might be wrong on that assessment.  It just seemed the restaurant was nestled among business buildings.
Lots of available parking but do note thatme of it is either restricted (not sure why) or is valet parking.  There is a parking lot a couple of yards away from the restaurant that does offer free 2-hour parking if the parking is validated.
The restaurant will validate the parking token if you do ask as I did.  The waiter also reminded us to have it validated as well.
Interior decor is interesting as there was a large picture of a grass meadow and, if I remember correctly, a cow which I assume has something to do with the fact that the restaurant does offer burgers from grass fed cows.  Interior was also really spacious with a bar, and lots of exterior/interior lighting.  Noise level wasn't bad.  Dress is casual.
There were outdoor seating with misters which was also good. 
Seating was adequate and comfortable, and the dining areas was clean.  

Menus - both dining and drink menus were easy to read and understand.  Waitstaff was happy to answer any questions we had on either menus.        

Service - on entering the restaurant, staff pleasantly greeted us, and was prompt to show up at our table to take our orders.  Even the wait time for the food wasn't bad.    

Food - I had the Zinburger itself which is a certified Angus beef, with Manchego cheese, Zinfandel braised onions, lettuce and mayo.  If you want to make the beef grass fed, it's $5 extra.  The burger tasted great -- really fresh; cooked to perfection and as I had asked -- well done; juicy; and really well seasoned.  It certainly didn't taste like your ordinary ground chuck you pick up from the supermarket.  Even the buns seemed lightly buttered and soft and fresh.  My only complaint was that the burger appeared small.  I guess I was expecting a tower of a burger...something I couldn't hold with both hands and certainly couldn't fit in my mouth.  This burger I was able to comfortably hold with both hands and was easy to fit into my mouth (-1).
The vanilla malt shake was very rich and creamy as it should, and came with a straw and spoon, though the latter wasn't needed throughout the meal.    
The sweet potato fries were fresh, warm/hot, and not soggy or limp, but actually very crispy.

It's questionable if I'll be back, though the burgers tasted great, they were kind of small (in my opinion) for the price; however, it is definitely worth checking out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service for a great price. The Farm Salad and Kobe Burger were fantastic and the malt choices for dessert were a perfect option for my sweet tooth. Highly recommend. We will be back."}
{"text":"So this place is called ZinBurger so get a burger! My mistake I ordered the tuna sandwich which sounded delicious and my sever even agreed and recommended it. It had no flavor and was very blah even after applying the chipotle mayo to it. I had two bites and couldn't eat anymore. The server was very kind and hospitable about not liking the sandwich and took care of it. However the zucchini fries where the best thing I had there!!!! Get them over the truffle fries and onion rings. The salted caramel milkshake was good nothing great mostly tasted like a vanilla milkshake with a little caramel on top. You could skip the shake. But the service was just ok.. My daughter never got her strawberry lemonade so I didn't mention it since I already had a problem not liking the sandwich and our server was quiet couldn't really hear her, but was hospitable. I wouldn't go back unless I was just noshing."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger I have ever had!  The meat was cooked perfectly as ordered, the cheese was melted and the bun was fresh and warm.  They weren't very busy when we went in and service was very fast.  We had tried to go to Lo-lo's next door and were treated so poorly we left.  Thank you Zinburger - you saved a family brunch!"}
{"text":"1st time I went here the food was so good. Was super excited to go back... That was about 3 months ago and there food was cold and not what you see in the pictures. I figured they were having an off day. So today took my brother there today and the food was cold, I got the Kobe burger, the cheese was not melted and had like 4-5 mushrooms on it. I think I am over paying 15.50 for a cold burger that leaves you wanting something better! Service was friendly but the cooking was crappy! No more chances."}
{"text":"Took some friends and the Service was perfect. Thank you. The food was delish. The desserts are huge. Appetizers were perfect to share and my fav was zucchini fries."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time at this location and the service was Awesome.  Malloy and Brendon gave us exceptional guest service.  The food was delicious. The restaurant and bathrooms were super clean thank you."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, and definitely not my last. The onion rings were the most flavorful I've ever had. I like my burgers well done, and mine was thoroughly cooked, but still very juicy.  My server was attentive and friendly.  Great place."}
{"text":"GET THE NAPA SALAD!

Yes, that is more like a tip, but you normally wouldn't think to order a salad at a burger place, so I put it in all caps and at the front of my review. My wife and I enjoy that salad so much that we split a large salad and a burger. 

So what, right? Well, that means that we have to *agree* on which burger to get. We have vastly different tastes, so that can be a real challenge. Still, it is worth it to get some Napa Salad awesomeness. It may not sound like much: \"Mixed Greens, Iceberg, Dried Fruit, Marcona Almonds & Goat Cheese Vinaigrette,\" but the combination of flavors and textures is fantastic. (Note that the \"Goat Cheese Vinaigrette\" actually means that there are pieces of goat cheese in the salad, not just mixed into the dressing)

So, enough about the salad. The burgers here are good, too. They cook them a little more rare than other places -- they're thick burgers -- and \"medium well\" to them means \"a little pink in the middle.\" Keep that in mind when you're ordering in case you like your burgers w/o the red. Don't like their burger combinations? You can BYO burger from a list of ingredients and even swap out the burger patty with a slab of ahi, a patty of turkey, a breast of chicken, or even a veggie patty. For those into that kind of thing, there is even an upgrade to Kobe beef patty for $5 more.

Burgers are large and don't come with fries. The side orders are usually big enough to share among 2-3 people. The onion rings are usually nice, and serving them with BBQ sauce was new to me. I usually do mustard, but people tell me I'm a bit off there and that ranch dressing is the proper accompaniment. Anyway, the BBQ sauce was a good choice and adds a nice smoky flavor.

They also have shakes and pies. I don't know about the pie, and I haven't had a shake here, but the list of possibilities is very long and I may have to break down at some point and do something about that. 

Service was quick and efficient, no complaints there."}
{"text":"I really want to rate Zinburger a 3.5, with the potential to improve to a 4, but I'll go with the 3.

The good:
-My Kobe burger was really good.
-My wife's salad with chicken was good.
-I like the way the windows and open area by the bar frame the Esplanade - I felt like I was in a big city (big meaning dense, not big meaning sprawling).
-Nice casual atmosphere.

The bad:
-Some uncomfortable \"we just opened last night so this is my second day on the job\" moments with the staff.  They were friendly but it felt forced (maybe 'cuz the boss was in the house?) - I thought the three high-school age hostesses were going to gang-tackle me and physically throw me into a booth, all in the name of good service.  I'm sure in time this will work itself out.
-My really good Kobe burger was $14, with no sides.  And my beer was $7.  Add $6 for fries or a side salad and your hamburger dinner just cost $34.
-The zucchini fries were awful - this is probably a matter of personal taste, and not reflective of the quality of Zinburger.
-The sweet potato fries were OK - I've yet to have a sweet potato fry I enjoy as much as a Delux sweet potato fry.

I didn't have the guts to try the bacon bloody mary.  I don't like bloody mary's, but ... bacon... mmmmm.

So, all in all, not bad.  But, if I was going to have one burger and sweet potato fries dinner before I died, it would be at a wonderful little place a mile and a half east on Camelback.  Luckily my situation is not that dire and I can still enjoy a meal at Zinburger."}
{"text":"Zucchini fries are AMAZING! Burgers are AMAZING! Shakes are AMAZING! And to top it all off, the service is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"In the top 3 of all burger places in all of Phoenix. My family rates it as #1.

Nice interior, large variety of burgers offered, service is good and the banana pie is the best desert. You will also enjoy the diverse selection of shakes offered.

You will leave happy!"}
{"text":"From the minute my daughter and I walked in the experience was AMAZING. The waiter was awesome and had a very welcoming smile. The food was perfect and my daughter loved her shake. Start to finish it was amazing."}
{"text":"The best place to get great tasting food. Everyone super polite and service was excellent.  El Diablo burger is my recommendation.  Nice days the windows and doors are open to make you feel like you are eating outside."}
{"text":"Since the Zinburger was offering a 2 for $30 restaurant week menu and my BFF and I have been wanting to try this place for a while, we popped in for our BFF date night. 
There was a wait for two; but since there were seats open at the bar, we opted to sit there. I was totally fine with that because my back was now toward the wall with the cow mural on it. I personally feel a little awkward eating a burger while a cow is staring at me. Even if it is a painting. 
The service was initially slow at the bar, but it was really busy when we got there. After that, the bartenders were attentive and friendly. 
The restaurant week menu was 2 glasses of wine, 2 burgers, and a side to share for $30. That's a good deal. We got the Zinburger and the Samburger and split both. We ordered both cooked medium; one came more medium rare and one more medium well. I like my burgers more medium well, so I was ok with that one, but had to think past the extra pinkness of the other burger. My only main complaint, but they were still very tasty. The onions on the Zinburger were super yummy. Our sweet potato fries were so good as well and appreciate getting those before our burgers to snack on while we waited for the main event. This was enough food to stuff us. 
Next time I'll have to split one burger and fries so I'll have enough room for dessert. I'm a sucker for banana cream pie and that's on the menu.
After the wine, I tried the vanilla lime sarsparilla cocktail.  The combination sounds a little strange, but it was super tasty.  
Everything was super good and the restaurant is casual cool.  I will be a repeat visitor."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu is fantastic.  Gear up a jalapeño popper burger and a chicken sandwich for me, kids meals for the gremlins, and a shockingly delicious vegetarian option for the Mrs., and we're in business!  Great spot for dinner with kids and the extended family on the 5pm dinner tour!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 on Saturday afternoon. The place is very busy. The waiting \"text\" system does not work - we were told 30 minute wait, got a text in 20 (happy), walked in and they had given our table to someone else claiming to be us (sad). Ok, so what can you do - nothing - wait again 20 minutes. Got a table. You'd think they'd give you a free shake or something for their mistake and inconvenience but nope and no visit by the manager. Foods good. The place is too busy for the staff to manage. Think about it."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and efficient. I crafted my own burger because the menu was limited to me. Very expensive-$11 for a burger, which did not come with fries. Had to pay $5 for a side of fries. My burger was undercooked. I asked for medium rare and got rare.  The meat was fresh but definitely not worth $11.  Probably paying that price because it's in downtown Gilbert. Probably won't go back because of pricing. I have to say again, the staff was excellent."}
{"text":"This an absolute fantastic place to eat dinner with the family! I have a younger sister who is incredibly picking with toppings and I love that they have just a classic burger with the simple tomato, lettuce and pickles. Our server, EJ, was absolutely outstanding. He was on top of refilling our drinks and kept apologizing that our food was a little behind, it was really busy but it came out relatively fast. Overall it was an amazing experience and the food and shakes were fantastic."}
{"text":"This review is overdue as I have been at this location 4 times now and EVERYTIme the Service and Food has been Outstanding!!!......You have great seating choices at a sunny outside table or at the open air full liquor bar with big screen TV's overhead........The burgers melt in your mouth and i HIGHLY recommend you try the zuchini side as despite the huge portion it is delicious!......Oh yeah, parking at Biltmore Fashion Square is a little tricky, so REMEMBER to keep your yellow token WITH YOU and give it to your server to scan it and park for free."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place ever and I don't like a lot of burgers! Everything that I've ever had here is wonderful and the best burgers I've had. My personal favorite is the blanco burger, though their breakfast burger is really great as well! Be sure to ask if they have a burger of the day; once they had a Greek burger which wasn't available on the menu, but it was amazing! Service here is hit or miss but the food is so good that I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I have to reconnect and revise my review. I have to say that customer service is definitely a priority here. We had a manager reach out to us and invite myself and my family back. The second visit was amazing and just the fact they took interest in us really shows they take pride in customer service. They have definitely won our hearts back and we will recommend them to all of our friends and family."}
{"text":"First time at this location was shortly after opening, fast forward a few weeks and things have definitely gone down hill. Giving them a 3 based on the 5 I would have given them the first time and a 2 this time. I hope they figure it out cause the competition is coming to Gilbert and there are too many choices to have poor service and average food, that and I love the Fox franchise."}
{"text":"Always love the burgers here--have tried most of them and their specials are always good. Really enjoy their local beer selection (bought a whole case of Kilt Lifter at Costco after trying it here), and their sweet potato and zucchini fries are delicious. Have been here at least 5 times and always enjoy the food and service. I was only disappointed today after trying their turkey burger, which is overloaded with salt (can I have some turkey with my salt?). Haven't tried the chicken burgers but I don't know if I will now. Most people get turkey and chicken if they want to be healthy, so I don't know why they would add so much salt. Definitely recommend this restaurant, for drinks fries and beef burgers, just don't eat their turkey burgers."}
{"text":"5 stars in my book! I came back and brought my mom..which means big things ;). They have my fave Zin- Manifesto,that plus their Zinburger..can't be beat. Especially before a movie across the street or some shopping in the Biltmore. See server-Marcus- he'll make sure you're taken care of. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great for Happy Hour, love the deals on half off wine and fries. Summer deal includes certain burgers as well but the portions are still great.

Our favorites are the green chilie fries and blue boy burgers....favorite shake is the salt and caramel. Good crew and accommodating staff. Just a little annoying that the bathroom is outside and there is a wait if you don't get there early enough."}
{"text":"We came today for lunch and I had the El Caballero burger (special of the week). It was really good but so spicy. I like food that has a kick to it, but I had to take some of the jalapeños off. We also had the truffle fries and spicy green chili fries. They are amazing. The truffle fries comes with truffle sauce which was So good. Good service and great burgers."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's soooo yummy! The service is always fast and the staff is so friendly! Haven't had a burger yet I don't like, and do forget to ask about the special burger they never disappoint. Also try to save room for one of their homemade pies at the end of the meal!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I started a dinner club and Zinburger was the first selection. I enjoyed it! 

I had a difficult time deciding between burgers (the homemade veggie burger with tomato marmalade- which I'm obsessed with right now- sounded so good). I was very hungry, so I decided I needed some beef. I ordered the Zinburger well done (yes, I like my hamburger meat practically burned and yes, I know carcinogens are bad). The burger comes topped with Manchego Cheese and wine braised onions. I nixed the mayo and added avocado. I ate every last bite of the buger (except for the slice of avocado that shot out of the burger and across the table - oops). 

We all shared sweet potato fries and truffle fries, which were both very good! I personally didn't prefer their dipping sauces... yogurt (tzaziki style) and truffle aioli (seemed more like plain mayonaise). 

Our waitress was excellent! Very attentive and informative about the food options.

I'd like to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is.  OVERPRICED, Less than average burger with no flavor.  Asked for medium well, arrived medium rare.  Service was good but typical, fake server enthusiasm.  Surprised they weren't wearing flare."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this place.  Actually, I shouldn't say that I am wholly disappointed with the place as much as I am disappointed with the quality of service that I get for the outrageous price.

The wife and I weren't terribly hungry (after a killer breakfast from another of FRC's spots - True Food) but it was lunch time and we weren't going to have a chance to eat again till much later so we wandered over to Zin burger.  Cool place.  Nice inside.  Looks like most of the newer FRC places.  Good vibe, crazy walls, wicked wait for a burger place.

So we each got a milkshake and then split an order of sweet potato fries and a bacon burger.  The milkshake was a double chocolate mint shake that was excellent.  I didn't think the $6 price tag was outrageous but when it came out and only 1/4 inch of my spoon was sticking out of the glass, I was a bit annoyed.  You know you have shakes, you are the ones who bought the glasses, maybe buy some shake spoons?  For $6 I shouldn't have to fish it out.  Anyways, it was good.  Better than most restaurant shakes, so I was happy.

The fries came out next.  Thought it was a bit odd since we didn't order them separately but I guess the waiter thought they were our appetizer.  The yogurt dipping sauce is very tart by itself but it a perfect compliment to the fries.  The fries are also bathed in salt so I enjoyed them very much.  In all, the fries were good but the presentation was pretty cheap.  The ramekin of yogurt was sitting on the fries inside the paper-lined basket.  It had spilled on the fries.  I'd prefer a plate.

Finally (and I do mean FINALLY...like 35 minutes after ordering), the burger came out.  It had been cut in half, which I appreciated.  It was cooked to a perfect medium and was pretty tasty.  We gad ordered the Samburger because my wife likes bacon but I really wasn't feeling that bacon.  I wished it had the turkey bacon from True Food because the Applewood Smoked bacon that was on there was hard and tasteless.  In all, it was a good burger.  Was it a good $10 burger?  Not really, but half is enough to fill you up, and if you split it, it is only a $5 burger.  For $5, it is great!

Now to my final complaint and the thing that would normally make me turn this into a 2 star review but I know that they are going to fix it.  Despite their intention to fix it, it was still left this way and still screwed up my experience.  If you sit in one of the booths behind the hostess table, you have a perfect view of the men's bathroom door.  No big deal except, and this is a big except, when someone opens that door to go in...you get a full on view of someone using the urinal.  Now that kind of thing might fly over around 7th Ave & Indian School but not at Biltmore and not for these prices.  I do not want to watch people urinate and do all of the other things that guys do while they are in the bathroom while I am eating.  I'm sorry but it was gross.

Lastly, don't have Harold as your waiter.  He was snotty, insistent, and inattentive.  He took plates before we were done, had an attitude when we asked to split the burger, and continually ignored us as he attended to the larger (and subsequently more lucrative) table next to us.

I might give Zinburger another chance but in reality, there are enough burger places along Camelback (Modern Burger, Grind, Culvers, Smashburger, Wineburger, etc) to keep me occupied for a while."}
{"text":"I arrived with my two kids... was told we would be sat in just a minute. Two parties of 5 and 7 arrived after us, yet they proceeded to seat both parties AND a couple that all arrived after us. We walked out. There were plenty of empty seats both outside and inside for us and the parties to be seated. I thought it was common sense to seat people on a first come first serve basis, unless you have reservations, which this place doesn't appear to do, nor did the parties have any reservations."}
{"text":"Always great. Service is always spot on.  Make sure to try a different burger each time you go.  The zucchini fries are amazing and shareable."}
{"text":"Always a great time in this place to enjoy with friends or family. My favorite is the diablo burger with loaded fries, but if you are not on the spacy mood, you can try the plain and simple or the blanco burger. The also offer some delicious desserts and beer selection. The area is also nice, you can sit in or outside when the weather is nice and there is plenty of parking. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find!! Visiting from California and came with my family! Everything was great! I had the Chinese Chicken Salad, side of fries I split and the Nutella Milkshake! All so good. The building is so cool! Our server was training to we had 2!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a coworker, who turns out to be a foodie just like me. Sometimes, I'm a little skeptical about trying new places, but I'm definitely glad I came here. Our server, Tabitha, was all too happy and excited to hear my fiancé and I were virgins here. (She truly had the best reaction when I said \"we're virgins here. What's good?\") She took the time to explain what they were about, told us what she believed to be the most popular, and by request, gave us her top three favorites. She was absolutely fantastic!!! It was like she was part of the family. We even took a group selfie. :) Now - about the food. That was the best burger we ever had. I ordered the Zinburger, my fiancé ordered the ringer, we both ordered the Nutella crunch shake (which we lovingly describe as an orgasm in a glass), we shared a loaded fries, and had a local beer (SanTan, I think). It was one of those moments where after you're finished eating, you're sad because you want more; yet at the same time, you're full and need a wheelbarrow to get out. Great customer service is hard to come by, ESPECIALLY in the food industry. It's even harder to spread about because one typically hears how horrible the service or experience was. I feel that you need to hear the good along with the bad. The only negative thing I have to say is I want more. But even then, that's not really negative"}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers, fish, chicken sandwiches and beers.  Great sides and great service.  Nice atmosphere and moderately priced."}
{"text":"They have a great Kobe style burger for a good price and you can sit outside by the water fountains.  There is a good selection of burgers and food with a list of well selected beers and wine to pair with your food."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Zinburger for restaurant week and I am so grateful I finally got to try this place out.  When arriving I thought we might have a long wait but we had just the right amount of time we grabbed a beer at the bar and watched the game right about halfway done they called us for our table.  

We had both checked out the menu online so we knew what we wanted.  I ordered the Zinburger which had Manchego Cheese, Zinfandel Braised Onions & Mayo.  I got it medium rare and it was amazing.  The juices were dribbling down my arms and it was messy just like a real burger should.  We both got fries to share one order of sweet potato and one of the double truffle.  The sweet potato fries were good but the dipping yogurt was just ok.  Tasted a lot like tzatziki sauce.  The double truffle fries were really good we finished them all.  

For the dessert I had the Crème Brûlée Shake that had Vanilla Ice Cream, Madagascar Vanilla Bean, Fresh Cream & Crushed Caramel.  OMG that was my heaven in a glass.  That is one of my favorite desserts and turning that into drinkable goodness I was very happy.  

I left in a total food coma and can't wait to go back again.  The service was on point and the food was great as well."}
{"text":"We came here on date night craving delicious burgers and we were not disappointed. In fact, the whole experience exceeded our expectations. It was a Saturday about 4pm when we walked in. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our waitress came over quickly asked if it was our first time, it was, and explained their burgers are ground fresh, twice daily and the sides are ala carte, but enough to feed two people. We ordered our drinks, I got the Zangria and it was refreshing and not overly sweet. My husband had the local lumberyard hefeweizen. We ordered a build your own burger, with bacon and avocado with swiss, cooked pink throughout and the my boy Bleu with a-1, Bleu cheese, carmelized onions and the husband added feta, cooked well done. For sides we got the loaded fries with sour cream, bacon, scallions and cheese sauce and the Zucchini fries with garlic aioli. Everything was cooked perfectly, the bacon was crispy, the burger was fresh and juicy, the vegetables were fresh and the Zucchini fries were as amazing as the waitress recommended. I had a fresh squeezed to drink with the burger and it really made for the perfect meal. For two beers, zangria, two shared sides and two burgers, our total was $63, before tip. We even called the manager over to tell him how awesome our waitress was. While we saw a few kids in there, i would say it's more conducive to older kids. We would definitely come back for date night or a night out with friends. Well worth paying a little more for a great experience and great food."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place so i decided to try it.
1. The girls that greet you seemed a bit snooty
2. The hamburgers were cooked properly but absolutely no flavor .. just very plain 
3. And way way over priced .."}
{"text":"Great place!
    
It was a Monday night and the place was busy.  I was able to get a booth.  My server was very friendly and came to take my order right away. 

I order the small farm fresh salad (wow was it tasty) and the zucchini fries.  The salad was FRESH and had a very tasty champagne dressing that was on the side. I will definitely be ordering this again.  The zucchini fries were also tasty my only complaint was to much parmesan cheese on them. 

If you are in the quarter looking for a less expensive meal this is the place!"}
{"text":"I was neither satisfied or dissatisfied. My burger had good flavor, the onion rings were good, but my sons burger was gross and the fries were just all right. All in all it was really $$$ for a burger place."}
{"text":"Good: quantity, flavor, real ice cream for the shakes. The place is clean. The service is prompt and friendly. 

Could be better: price for value. There are other places in town where burgers are as big for the same price that have better flavors. 

Advice: got kids and want a place not crazy expensive that will make the family happy? Put this place on your list.  Want a place not overflowing with screaming little kids? Don't come here or come late."}
{"text":"A bit closer to 2.5 stars but my server was super friendly so that is why it's a 3.

I was craving a burger and had seen this place mentioned a few times being named as one of the \"Best Burgers in Phoenix\".   I decided to come down and check it out.  Pay parking which you can get validated.  They use plastic tokens...reminded me of a small poker chip.  Anyways..........walked inside and was seated against the wall.  My server came over and asked me if it was my first time here etc.  She went over the whole drill.  I decided to order the Zinburger (minus mayo), an order of fresh cut fries and a Diet Pepsi to drink.  Here is how everything tasted.................

Zinburger-  ($10.50)  This is a ground beef patty (I'm assuming 1/3 lb...it was a good sized patty) topped with manchengo cheese, zinfandel braised onions, and lettuce.  I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect.  It was presented nicely but it was lacking greatness.  I took a bite of the meat itself and it tasted really great...like steak!  The cheese was melted on top of the burger and the onions were layered nicely on top of the cheese.  It came on a soft \"fancy\" bun.  Each item itself was great...when combined though, it left something to be desired.  All I could really taste was bread and onions.  The meat/burger was not the star of the show.  The lettuce addition was a little weird too.  It probably would have been better without.  It was a decent enough burger but for a \"fancy\" higher end burger joint, I expected more.  It ain't cheap either!  

Hand Cut Fries-  ($5.00)  These things were actually really good.  They give you a nice sized mound of them.  They were hot and crispy and delicious.  They needed just a bit more salt, but other than that, they were really good.  Better/more memorable than the burger.

Diet Pepsi- Is what it is.

Why only 2.5/3 stars?  For a burger, fries and drink, it was $19.98...that is before tip!  I will never ever ever ever ever ever pay $25.00 to come back here for simple comfort food.  It's just way too expensive for what you get!   The staff was all pretty friendly, the layout is cool (kind of a hipster vibe), and they validate parking for up to 2 hours.  I am glad I came to check it out, but sadly I will not be returning...the value is just not there.  Once I hit that lotto and move to Scottsdale, then we can come here often lol."}
{"text":"A great place for a burger. Well above average but not as good as some gourmet places that take burgers to a new level. Plus, if you have kids or your a kid at heart, order a shake. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm sorry.  I did not like this place.  Food was OK,  we had two burger's, fries and a drink each.....cost us over fifty bucks.  Too much for so little, will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I ordered a blanco burger and loved it. The wait was long on a Saturday evening but that's true of every place in the area."}
{"text":"I went here on sunday afternoon. Thought it would be good place to go to since the day was great. Sat the bar which was cool. I ordered the creme brulee shake, turkey burger and my friend (the great lover he is-lol) had a Sam burger and we shared the sweet potato fries. 

The shake did not taste nothing like creme brulee, it was just plain ol vanilla shake, nothing special about this shake. I could have passed on it but hey wouldnt have known what it taste like until I tried it. 

My lover-friend really liked his burger, but wished it would have came with fries automatically. My burger was ok, again I was not blown away by it. The sweet potato fries were good as always with the dipping sauce. 

I thought everything was ok. I kinda look at it like an ''upscale burger joint'' and I am using that term loosely. I would possibly come back, the ambiance was good, I would mos def try something different the next time I come."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, did you say truffle fries and a jalapeño popper burger?  Heck yaaaasss!  Why don't I come here more often?!?"}
{"text":"Such a great Burger and our waiter Justin W. Was AWSOME!!! Even surprised me with pie for my Birthday! Found out we share the same day! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fox got it right on this one.  Great location and blows Deluxe out of the water.  The food is spot on and service was great....SHort of it, for those not wanting to read the whole review - big patties that are juicy on a great bun.  No flat burgers!!!! So to break down

Atmosphere:  Chill, open and good outdoor seating.  The Cow mural is pretty rad in the background..  Bar is open to both inside and outside.  Hostess was not impressive, but then again it is the hostess ( sorry girls/boys its true)  I care more about the server

Server: Fantastic, I would have hired to anything customer service related, offered suggestions and even recommended something and had the chef make.

Food: menu straight forward burgers nothing funny.  The zucchini fries are great as well as there general fries.  I had the Zin burger and added mushrooms and switched out manchego to havarti.  Matthew had the breakfast burger which had a fried egg and avocado.  They offer shakes that sound great, but with a huge burger and fried I did pass.

This place is solid - I recommend over smashburger and Deluxe"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. My supervisor took me and my colleague here for lunch. I had the Zinburger. It was very good. My friend had the Asian chicken salad and sweet potato fries. The fries were excellent. I've since returned and had the salad. I love it!

Good customer service, nice vibe. I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Zinburger's veggie burger has officially beaten my previous favorite (The Vig). It is SO GOOD. I love that I can get any of their burgers with the veggie patty - so far, the buffalo chicken burger with veggie patty is my absolute favorite combination. My husband has really enjoyed everything he's gotten as well, and their french fries are soo delicious.

The service is always awesome, the food is always stellar, and the milkshakes are amazing! Zinburger has quickly become one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Food and service are good. Something about this location though with the clientele is just so unpleasant. Every time we have come in, there are barefooted kids jumping on the booths or behaving like they are animals in a barn. We also frequent the Biltmore location and have not had the same experience. If you like to have a peaceful meal without barefooted, loud, rude kids disturbing you, I would not recommend this location. I'm wondering it there is anything management can do to dissuade this behavior? We've honestly seen children behaving like wild beasts in this restaurant at least 5 times now. The parents just always smile like their darlings are doing nothing wrong. 
I've raised 2 kids and they never behaved like animals out at restaurants. If they did, they would be removed. I guess it must be a north Scottsdale trend now to have your children permitted to do whatever they please. Really unfair to all of the other patrons that just want to enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this review 3.5 stars.  

I like the layout, the space, the decor and the vibe was good (up until about 8:45pm and then the restaurant was DEAD) but for the price the food was just okay and the burgers were WAY too salty. Like, holy crap salty. 

We started with the chopped salad which was good (but small) and a couple different orders of fries - all yummy. 

The service was great - the hostess, bartender and our waitress - just wish the burger matched the rest of it. 

We left feeling \"eh\" - and not planning our next trip back. Its an easy place to grab a Friday night dinner, decent food and vibe, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"My experience at Zinburger today was beyond exceptional.  If you go to Zinburger Austin is the waiter to ask for.  You won't be disappointed.  His eagerness to please, his mannerisms go over above and beyond!!!  His polite and pleasing demeanor will absolutely make you fall in love with him!!  If you're having a rough day, please go see Austin!!!"}
{"text":"The best Nutella Hazelnut Crunch shake I've had of all the Zinburgers I've been to not to mention ever. And I like to consider myself a food connoisseur. The burger of the week that I had was great. It was a Beef & Brie burger. The only discrepancy that I found was the portion of the Truffle Aioli fries that I ordered from this location was significantly smaller in proportion than the others I've been to for the same orders. But I was very pleased with my shake so I shook it off. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"MMMMMooooo tasty sad cows. Very sorry mr cow but you're so tasty and zinburger makes it so much more delicious ... :( Please do not go vegan for sake of the tastiness happening here."}
{"text":"Food great!  Service....not so much....waited 20 minutes for an iced tea when rest of the table had drinks due to dirty glasses.....110°, outside, thirsty...no Bueno :("}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the service was top-notch. I will definitely be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Been twice and the burgers were excellent each time.  Service was fast and we were out in under an hour.  Burgers are on the pricey side and large, so consider splitting with a side of fries.  Large selection of craft beers, good wine list.  A little hipster, but not eye-rollingly so.  No beard and beanie required for entry."}
{"text":"I ordered the regular zinburger with fries. The burger was good along with fries. I don't rate it higher because it is expensive. $20 for  the meal with tea is a little too much. It was good but not that good!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after hearing all the rave reviews. Ambiance feels like the chain that it is. There are certain nice touches like the bar but really generic. Service was great. Even though there was a 45 minute wait, the staff was so sweet and friendly that it didn't feel like it at all. I ordered the house zinburger and truffle fries. For my first burger, I wanted to try the original. 

Overall I felt the meat was good quality and you could taste the difference. It was juicy and done perfectly medium. But I have to say that the rest of the burger was uninteresting. The buns were fine, at times a bit dry. The garlic aioli was mild in flavor. I was disappointed. The truffle fries were good but honestly fries aren't all that difficult. Anything fried will taste pretty bomb and add truffle is a easy win. 

Overall, didn't get swept up in the hype. Would go back and try something different."}
{"text":"The kobe burger with the wild mushrooms is a must!  Also recommend the milkshakes and the zucchini fries."}
{"text":"K and I were looking for a place to hang for happy hour while C was at his rehearsal. We decided to check out the goings on in Gilbert. We stopped in Zinburger and asked the hostess to see the happy hour menu. It's basically a card that lets you know that Wine Bottles and Glasses are half price, Draft Beers are half price, the Plain & Simple Burger is $7, and Sides and Fries are half price.
K and I grabbed a couple seats near the bar. Our server was Botta. She was very nice, polite and attentive when needed.
K and I opted to order the Loaded Fries ($3.50hh) and the Mac & Cheese ($3.00hh). The loaded fries are topped with Applewood Smoked Bacon,
Cheese Sauce, Sour Cream & Chives. The portion size is absolutely fair and of course the happy hour pricing makes them a steal. Winner winner loaded fries dinner. 
The Mac & Cheese was equally as tasty. The noodles were cooked just right and the cheesy sauce was quite good. Portion size again was fair and the happy hour price makes this another great bargain.
K had a glass of Riesling ($3.00hh) and I had a glass of the Hey Mambo Red Blend ($4.00hh). Both our wines were fine.
Now I don't throw out 5 Stars like a lot of my brotheran, but I just can't figure out where Zinburger could have improved this experience.
Great Service. Great H.H. Pricing. Great Food. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Last time I went to Zinburger I was wearing a black dress, and the hostess switched out the white napkin with a black one.... real classy."}
{"text":"Anytime I crave a burger...this is where I go.  Is it the very best burger I have ever had? No, however it's very close, great location, nice set up being able to sit at the bar outside and the food is still very good. Needless to say, I will be back."}
{"text":"What a delicious experience!! 
My parents and I came here for an afternoon lunch and we were really impressed. I completely fell in love with their sweet potato fries. My parents both ordered their hamburgers and you could see every fresh ingredient that was used. They both raved on how it was one of the best burgers they ever tasted. Juicy, flavorful, and complimenting.
We will be coming back here more often than we think!! Thank you Zin."}
{"text":"Zinburger is delicious and great for groups, another amazing addition to the DT Gilbert area. It's upbeat, modern, comfortable and clean. The staff is very friendly and they have a good mix of brews, wines, cocktails and milkshakes. 

Two of my favorite things about ZB is the shareable dishes (zucchini sticks and different kinds of fries) and the burger of the moment! If the menu wasn't exciting enough, there is a different burger every time I visit and I love the creativity every time! 

I have two favorite burgers on the menu: The Bruce Lee and the SamBurger. The Bruce Lee has unique flavors that include, crisp napa cabbage slaw and cucumbers with some spice from the jalapeños and sriracha mayo. It literally karate kicks with flavor! Super cheesy but absolutely necessary! It is a little messy so make sure you have your napkin on you and you're not wearing white! Although this burger is delicious you cannot go wrong with the good ol' SamBurger. Also make sure to add an egg for extra credit to make it taste 110% delicious!

To be honest, the only real problem with Zinburger is that they have so many intriguing options that you may take a while to decide...or you'll just end up ordering two burgers instead of one! Come hungry cause you will eat it all and not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Couple of days ago my husband and I were at the apple store in the quarter and once we were done it was 9:00 and we wanted to grab something easy and quick. we decided on Zinburger. we wanted to grab a burger and split it since it was so late. Anyways I don't know which burger he ordered it had cheese and quac. It was AMAZING & I'm not even a burger kind of girl. wow juicy and yummm. We also got the truffle fries also amazing. My husband was going to order a shake for desert but he was too full by then. but it looked like they had a long list of amazing shakes to try. we loved this place and for sure be back."}
{"text":"What is there not to love about Zinburger ? seriously ? The burgers are great the salads are great and the chicken is delicious along with milkshakes for the kids yum or adults too :) The service here is always friendly the atmosphere is very kid friendly and there's lots of shopping and a splash pad perfect place for my family as we come here about once a week they also have a nice selection of IPA'S which my husband enjoys."}
{"text":"Very nice happy hour.  Simple and inexpensive.  Great buttermilk chicken sandwich.  Get there by 5, they get pretty busy soon after that.  Really good staff too."}
{"text":"I went here today. Save your money and go to 5 guys. Over priced burgers that are not that good. 12.50 for a burger I would have expected some real flavor. Boring burger that was greasy and I didn't finish it all. And I really would have expected a side of fries for the price...nope just the sad boring burger. Now on another note service was excellent. So if you want some wine and look at the very attractive staff eat here. Want a good burger...sorry folks go else where.

I'm not sure where these other reveiwers ate.but it doesn't sound like it was here."}
{"text":"Nice trendy place in the busy Biltmore Shopping District. The staff is very friendly and responsive. Burgers are all very unique recipes from your basic lettuce, tomatoes & cheese to rather exotic combinations. Rather than a typical beer I tried a shake and found it pretty tasty. All in all a good family or \"date night\" spot."}
{"text":"I'm actually a vegetarian and I love this place!! They have the BEST veggie patty I've ever had. I also love that you can get any burger as a veggie burger. If you like spicy, the Bruce Lee is AMAZING. I'm sure it would be great with a real patty too. The farm salad is also really good as well as truffle fries!"}
{"text":"I always love Zinburger; they never disappoint. Their salads look amazing, but I typically really want a burger when I go there. They have the second best burger in the valley, in my opinion, and the best for a \"burger joint\". 

My favorite is the El Diablo add smoked bacon and a side of double truffle fries. Oh my gosh, the double truffle fries portion is enough for two, but you WILL NOT WANT TO SHARE, so come hungry. 

I've heard great things about the milkshakes, but I usually stick to water or Kiltlifter. 

They have a clean atmosphere and the service is always good."}
{"text":"The location is fantastic and it's nice place to spend a little time enjoy some decent wine and pretty good burgers.   There's a nice selection to choose from and side dishes and huge, so come with a a friend or a big appetite.  Prices are reasonable and patio seating by the fountain is a great place to cool down and take a break from shopping.  I have to give very high marks for the servers.  They were attentive, friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Not worth it! Well I hate to say it but my experience was horrible. My $5 order of fries looked Like someone skimmed some off my basket. No joke it was literally 12 French fries and they were cold!! Ewww ! The burger my friend got was soggy and small! I ordered  the avocado grilled chicken sandwich that was also soggy and had gross shredded lettuce that was iceberg and brown. It was also lacking the avocado. I told the Waiter it was missing it and he took my plate and looked at it with my knife to inspect it.....  Because I guess he didn't believe me. He then deemed it cado less and took my entire plate back. He didn't even ask just took it and stormed off like I did something wrong. He brought it back 10min later after the other people at my table finished. It was the same sandwich but with a small sliver of avocado on it? Why couldn't he have brought the side of the avocado to my table? Didn't apologize or anything but came back to bring our Check and say, did that have enough avocado for you!?!? It was so rude ! He neglected to bring us back our change so I guess he deemed himself worthy of a 45% tip. Not a good pick for food which is so disappointing since the location is perfect. I will not try this place again. The food was horrid and it matched the service.




  I'm updating them to 4*. I'm very impressed in the enthusiasm & dedication of the employees of Fox group and the wait staff of ZIN Who have graciously reached out to me to apologize for my poor experience and have extended a very welcoming invitation to try them again. I look forward to trying them again under better circumstances. I'm really impressed with the pride that they have in their company and integrity."}
{"text":"I got the El Diablo grass feed hamburger with a basket of large fries half hand cut and sweet potato.  And a 16oz beer.  Cost was $26 dollars.  Honestly I wish I had gone to chuck box in Tempe.   The hamburger are way better and less than half the price."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the setting of the restaurant in downtown Gilbert and general vibe of the place are both good.  Our server was friendly and took care of us pretty well.  It was a good crowd for a Thursday night, and we dined outside on the patio enjoying the atmosphere and nice weather.

In terms of the food, My wife had a chicken 'Zinburger', and I had a regular one.  We also shared an order of Double Truffle Fries.  The fries were served before the burgers came out and were pretty good.  However, the burgers were a bit of a letdown for both of us.  The toppings on the Zinburger didn't seem to work extremely well with the beef or the chicken, and my wife indicated there was too much bun and not enough chicken for her taste.  We both felt the burgers were just kind of average and didn't stand out in comparison to the better burgers we've had elsewhere.  

We're both glad we tried the place and were able to cross it off our list,  but we wouldn't be inspired to make a return visit anytime soon."}
{"text":"Got the Blanco Burger. Hands down the best burger I've ever eaten. It was delicious! Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"We just grabbed drinks here. I ordered a blood orange martini and it was tasty! I was seriously lusting over the truffle fries at the next table! They smelled wonderful! We had other dinner engagements otherwise I would have eaten here! We will come back to try the food!"}
{"text":"Went in for the second time to give them a second chance and was still disappointed. The food is decent but the service was horrible both times. They were not super busy but were somehow out of glassware so we waited 15 minutes for our drinks then when the waiter dropped off our bill he disappeared I went to find the manager and even she couldn't find him. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Traveling from out of town and took the kids to this place.  Overall, we had a great experience here.  Keeping it from a 5 star is the price - just felt it was a little pricey for what we got but not totally unreasonable.  This is a chain that just opened  a location in ATL and we will return.

Kobe burger was fantastic.  Truffle fries a little disappointing but not bad.  Service overall was really good - fast and friendly.  Bartender was totally swamped and a little grouchy but no big deal.

We were staying at a hotel across the street and there is a great tunnel that goes to the Mall so you don't have to play Frogger with the traffic - bonus!

Of all the restaurant choices in this Mall thought it was the best for a fairly quick meal with the kids.  There were lots of families with kids while we were there."}
{"text":"Sam has built another great concept here. I had the Ahi Tuna sandwich and it was one of the best I've ever had.  It's reasonably priced and is something I will definitely hit again."}
{"text":"same review as other location: OVERRATED. Lol.  I had the burger with jalepenos and spicy sauce... I think it had some trendy name but I can't remember.  It was okay but too much bun, not enough patty for me. Also, too salty.  I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked medium rare.  Very juicy.  Just too much bun and caramelized onions.... and too salty on the sauce.  Otherwise a decent burger I guess.  We had a free gift card to this place otherwise I doubt we'd pay the money they want for dinner here.  $50 for two burgers, two side salads and two glasses of wine?  Yikes."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to Zinburger last week after having apps at Seasons 52 in the same shopping center. We weren't quite full and had a gift card, so figured we would go share a burger. There was a bit of a wait, and the waitress informed us that it was a little bit of a CF in the kitchen that night, but it seemed alright to us. Anyway, we sat on the patio after waiting for 20 min or so and ordered the ringer burger and a bananas foster shake to split. Well, I was impressed, because they brought out both items split for us in separate glasses/plates. That's awesome! The ringer burger was very tasty, it was just a little spicy with the right amount of crunchiness....I would definitely get one of these again. The shake was ah mazing. I don't even typically like shakes, but the banana mixed with the caramel was to die for. I am not a huge fan of most Fox restaurants, but this one was a winner for me. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loveeee Zinburger!!!!! I went for the first time a few years ago at the Phoenix location and I loved it.   

The first time I went I ordered the breakfast burger. This comes with avocado, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and the best part? A fried egg on top! It was delicious!!! This time I ordered the Blanco burger. This comes with avocado, pico de gallo, cheese, and a chipotle mayo. This one was also to die for! I washed everything down with a watermelon mojito that was very refreshing. And don't forget to get their fries! They're huge enough to share and they have a few options that will not disappoint you. My bf and I shared the truffle fries. The truffle sauce that comes with it was just icing on the cake. If you get a chance try their shakes too. I got the salted caramel shake one time and it was one of the best shakes I've had. 

I really believe that everything is delicious on their menu so you won't be disappointed. It was a beautiful day to sit outside on their nice patio which also have heat warmers and the service was spectacular. I'll be back!!! =)"}
{"text":"There's nothing like a good burger! 

I've heard so many good things about this place and FINALLY got to check it out this weekend, boy was everyone right about it! It was amazing! 

I saw the Breakfast burger and just had to get it. It comes with all of my favorites.. avocado, bacon, mayo and topped with a fried egg! Anything with a fried egg on it is good to me. lol. The burger was amazing and beyond delicious. I also ordered the Creme Brulee Milkshake which was soooooo good! You have to try it! We also ordered the Double Truffle Fries. It was good but it came with this weird Mayo dip which I was not too fond of. 

Everything was really amazing, HOWEVER the service... my oh my... Let's just say it was very disappointing... We ordered ranch and ketchup for our fries which never came. We had to flag down another waitress to get it for us. Also, our water cups were pretty much always empty. I almost felt the need to go to the bar just to get more water. =/ The waitress probably checked on us maybe once the entire time we were there. 

This place really does have amazingggg burgers! I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't for the poor service. I also wish there was one on my side of town as well but you can't win em all! =0"}
{"text":"Great! Had the Ahi Burger for a healthy option and it did not disappoint. Very appealing to the eye and tasty. Good prompt service. Overall good quality"}
{"text":"I had the zinburger, and it was fabulous!! I didn't need any condiments on it because the wine in the grilled onions, seasoned the burger so well! All I can say is YUM!
My friend had the turkey burger and he said it was very good as well. Zucchini fries were pretty tasty too, maybe I would try some other fries next time!
Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I love all Fox Restaurant Concepts and this is no exception!  Great food, the fries are amazing and I couldn't leave without trying one of the shakes.  It provides the comfort of a burger, fries, and a shake but with quality ingredients and taste.  The restaurant is also modern and trendy and the environment is enjoyable!"}
{"text":"It might sound strange that I am a vegetarian and yet this is one of my favorite restaurants-- that is how much I love their Farm salad! It has the freshest ingredients! I also LOVE their veggie burger-- one of the best veggie burgers I've had. Even though I am a vegetarian, I usually dine with meat lovers and everyone I've ever gone here with has loved their meal.  When going with a group, it is also fun to share a few of their different types of fries-- sweet potato, truffle, zucchini, etc.  Also, their salted caramel shake is perhaps my favorite dessert of all time!  Whether you are vegetarian or a meat-lover, you will love this place."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast burger it was HELLA good... The only thing I change about the burger is add another egg. We also had the zucchini fries very good as well. Make sure your hungry when you go cause it's a man size burger. The family had the shakes they were not impressed."}
{"text":"Good burgers and great service.  The food is a bit expensive but the best part is the kids can play on the splash pad after."}
{"text":"The service is usually always really good.  The happy hour prices are great - $5 for a burger and they are just a little smaller than the normal sized burgers.  My favorite is the classic zinburger."}
{"text":"I'll admit I didn't have the highest hopes - I mean, how much can you do with a burger that hasn't been done?

I was definitely surprised in a good way. I ordered the Breakfast Burger and it was SOOO good. The fresh beef came exactly medium well (as I ordered), the bacon was very flavorful and the bun had just a hint of sweetness and was also very fresh. 

I got the side of onion rings, and they were also excellent. The only place I have had better ones was Joe's Farm Grill. 

Since I'm a fatty I had to finish with a strawberry shake. Again, excellent.

Despite eating a LOT, I left feeling great. Not loaded up with grease or heavy.

It was very busy, but I feel we got served in a reasonable time and our server was friendly. Honestly, the only thing I didn't like was the iced tea but that's just a preference thing. 

My girl really enjoyed her food as well. It's nice to have another great option in Gilbert."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Fox restaurants and Zinburger is no exception. The new location in the Scottsdale Quarter met our expectations as usual. We started out with the fried zucchini with parmesan dipped in ranch. We are fairly health conscious so don't eat a lot of fried foods but these were worth the indulgence. Our entree was the kobe beef burger with manchego cheese and carmelized onion. We agree this burger is the best burger we have had ANYWHERE. It's an extra $5.00 to have it made with american style Kobe beef but soooo worth it. We shared a basket of hand cut fries that were delish. Topped off our meal with a Banana cream pie. Zinburger's desserts are mostly just a nice variety of milkshakes but they offer two types of pies, chocolate and banana. This is not like your momma's banana pie. Fantabulous! We shall return."}
{"text":"Out of all the Zinburger locations, this one is easily my favorite. The zucchini fries are an amazing side, crisp and delicious. Truffle fries with the truffle aioli is absolutely to die for- I'd put the aioli on everything. I had the salmon bowl, which was so delightful; the griddled sweet potato melted in my mouth, and the salmon was the best cooked salmon filet I've ever had. If you have room, absolutely get the banana royale shake- with real banana slices in it it's an absolute dream. 

The food is only made better by the amazing service we received. Sabrina was attentive and friendly, making great menu suggestions. We were even so lucky as to have the manager, Steffi, stop by our table and suggest a wine pairing for our meal. Overall, well deserving by of a 5 star review."}
{"text":"I first visited Zinburger during Restaurant Week.  I absolutely LOVED it!  The food was delicious and the service was excellent!

I just went again this past week and I didn't love it as much.  The burger was good and the fries were okay, but it wasn't as great as during Restaurant Week.  The service was just okay as well.

My daughters order chicken fingers and a grilled cheese.  Both were bad.  I had the Zinburger, which I really like.  I also order just the normal fries, which were just okay.

I won't be rushing to come back any time soon."}
{"text":"no preface, no disclaimers, and no tip-toeing here.

the truth of the matter is -- Zinburger needs to live up to their name a bit better. one would expect tasty, delicious burgers from a resto that has the word \"burger\" in it?

two out of four of our diners ordered red meat beef burgers - one was the kobe, and one was the zinburger. the kobe burger was not juicy, and the burger patty fell apart when cut. the zinburger actually seemed to do better, at least, by holding itself together! overall, the burgers lacked embellishment and that something special that i could not get from McD's (at least i might get a toy there?).

remarks for the ahi tuna sandwich included \"not good, it gave me a tummy ache. they lied to me! they gave me lettuce instead of cole slaw\"

feedback for the chicken sandwich was \"pretty good, but spicy\". that's probably why this diner had three beers to go along with it. hehe.

sweet potato fries vs. zucchini fries - sweet potato wins for being proper fries that do not fall apart (a recurring theme). zucchini fries dip wins though.

it's a great concept, which was what initially drew us into the resto, but execution? i might need a couple more bottles of Zin to swallow this one down!"}
{"text":"Love zinburger, this is THE best place in Scottsdale for a burger, fries and shake! Large comfortable booths, great staff, friendly service. Here is a dining tip....sign up to receive emails from all of the Fox Restaurant Groups. Trust me, you will be happy that you did!"}
{"text":"First time eating here today for lunch with the wife.  My physical therapist has continuously recommended this restaurant and I have to say we were very impressed.   I had the el Diablo burger which is delicious.   The green chili's were so tasty and spicy.   We also had the truffle fries which were decadent and delicious.   Definitely wasn't lacking in calories but we weren't able to finish the full meal so it was a great flavorful lunch.   
     Our server was excellent, nice open, airy atmosphere.   Prices weren't bad.  Great experience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I hung all my Memorial day hopes on a big tasty burger here, fail. OK its a holiday and there was a wait of about 15-20 minutes, no problem. Actually, if you wanted to sit outside you could have been seated immediately.
It was pretty noisy due to the lack of sound absorbing materials. Our server Wade was friendly and helpful. On to the food, well, we were given an order of the fried zucchini because they had made an order by mistake, ok cool we'll take it. It was hot so it had not been sitting around. The texture was pretty gross, it was mushy.They needed to be cooked more or less I couldn't figure it out, pushed those aside. Then came the burgers. I had the burger of the week, a \"steak burger\" cooked with A1, sauteed onions, lettuce, tomato, cheese and brioche bun. I asked for it to be cooked medium well which they did a good job on. The burger just didn't thrill me. It tasted mainly of A1. My friend had the West Coast Chicken. We split each in half to share. The chicken was ok but was a mess. By that i mean it fell apart just by looking at it. Now, lets talk about the price. Total with tax & tip $28. Thats with no drinks, just water and you get nothing with the burger, fries are extra. So, thats $14 per person for something we did not enjoy. Did I mention the restroom is a public outdoor deal....ya, thats a good idea. The closest I'll come to returning here will be at Joe's Real BBQ across the street."}
{"text":"What makes Zinburger so great is not the food, although the burgers, fries, salads, chicken, and drinks we had today were certainly some of the best I've had at the quarter. For example, the milkshake like drink I had with vanilla ice cream. Coffee bean, whip cream, a Latte. Then the unexpected happened! Our server, Alexander, started to expound on this drink and how he sometimes added Ghiridelli chocolate syrup or caramel syrup to the drink. Let's see, what a delicious dilemma: a mocha or a caramel machiota?? I finally chose the machiota. Boy, was it the greatest,and since it was my birthday, Alexander announced it would be free!! The great service never seemed to let up. Alexander warned my buddy that if she wanted her burger pink she should order the regular burger instead of the Kobe because it tended to get dry when well done. We really appreciated him telling us that and further added to our enjoyment of the meal. I could go on about my experience today. But please go on in to Zinburger and enjoy for yourself. I want to thank Alexander so much for making my special day even more do."}
{"text":"An hour and a half wait... Really? Kinda an epic fail and not coming back even when that was my first attempt to try the establishment."}
{"text":"Had a nice time here the other day! Went with a friend and we both had our small dogs with us so we sat out on the patio. The servers were more than accommodating to our furry friends and brought us water over right away. We split the chopped wedge salad and Zinburger...both very good options! Next time I will order my burger medium rare (vs medium well, opps my bad) :) Our husband's came to join us and both ordered the My Boy Blue burger...let's just say those burgers were gone in about 3 minutes. Safe to say they loved it ;) Next time I would like to eat inside at the bar, it looked fun in there!"}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert is so cute! 

Shakes are all $5-6 and the burgers are mostly in the $9.50-12.50 range.

We got the El Diablo (fire roasted jalapeño, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce, and chipotle mayo) and My Boy Blue (maytag blue cheese, A1 sauce, caramelized onion, lettuce, mayo and we added a fried egg) and the cookies and cream and chocolate mint shakes.  I really enjoyed both burgers but the blue cheese one was much more filling and heavy because it was so rich. The burgers were cooked rare like we like them per our instructions. The fried egg was a great addition to the My Boy Blue burger but it was cooked all the way through.  Maybe you have to request that the yoke be left runny?  I thought that was the whole point of putting egg on a burger!

We also enjoyed the Spicy Green Chili Fries ($7) but I thought the portion size could have been a little but more generous - too small to be shared by 4 people.  Only one bite was actually spicy.  The El Diablo burger was more spicy but not by a ton.

Loved our burgers, service was good, and we were seated within 5 minutes on a holiday Monday night (they are still pretty new though).

Easy parking in the big parking garage.

I would have liked to see a bit more beer offerings on tap and I didn't really like my pomegranate ginger mule."}
{"text":"We enjoy this place a lot!  We have tried many of the burgers and come in both small and large groups.  Service is always good and no one has ever come away with anything negative to say about their burgers or shakes.

I think they have a great turkey burger and you can sub a turkey patty for any of the beef patties so the menu is wide open even if you are not eating beef.

The shakes are great and the loaded fries are a favorite!"}
{"text":"Went only once, very early in the eve, on a weeknight. Pricey for a hamburger joint, but the ambiance is nice. Ordered takeout, sat at the bar. Took  15 minutes at least to get my order. Wished I had just sat there and enjoyed the meal, and great outdoorsy feel - It does feel more like a bar, leave the kids at home.
Worth a try!"}
{"text":"I think I'm done with Zinburger.  I loved it - I really, really did in the beginning, recommended it to lots of people, but don't think we'll be back.  Last fall, we went every Wednesday - after to swim lessons so it was convenient - and it had something for everyone.  But, lately, it's just not the same place as it used to be.  Went there Thursday at 6:00 and was told it would be a 30 minute wait.  What?  Seriously 1/2 the tables were empty.  Whatever.  We waited and waited and waited, and were finally seated (at one of the tables that were originally empty).  Server was okay.  When I ordered 3 waters, he rolled his eyes and walked away.  He only became friendly when I ordered some alcohol - I think he was worried that our table wasn't going to be worth his effort.  Food was just okay.  My kids burger was medium rare.  I didn't say anything - but ewwwww.  Now that Pomo and Barrio Queen have opened, I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Draft reviews are dumb. You should be able to post the review from your phone. OK now on to the real review..  The only complaint I have about this place is that if you order your burger with no bun it gets too messy and isn't as tasty as other places..however the burgers overall are great.  I've been back twice since my first visit and will return.  Another great concept by Fox"}
{"text":"I love this place! We stopped into Zinburger after church with our two girls, and then met our friends and their little boy too. We had a booth and a decent server. I ordered my usual Napa salad with chicken and then got the kids chicken tenders with sweet potato fries and a hamburger. We even splurged and got the girls shakes for dessert. The kids menu this summer is only $3 and $2 for shakes! You can't beat the quality of food at this place! We had a few beers at the table too that were all very tasty. Excellent place to stop by before heading to the splash pad. I highly recommend Zinburger!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what all the hype about this place is, other than it has a really cool design (bar, restaurant, patio, etc). 

We went on a Friday night around 4:45 and grabbed the last two bar seats we could find (there was about a 30/40 min wait for a table for 2 at that point).

The good: great service (bartenders were busy but awesome and our food came out relatively quickly and was hot and fresh). The milkshakes looked great but we didn't try one. The happy hour drink prices (across the board) were a steal! We will probably just grab drinks here while waiting for a table at Oregano's across the street in the future.

The meh: I've had better burgers (one geographically close example would be a certain wilderness themed brew pub nearby). And for $11-$13 something should come as a side with my burger, they're not THAT big. The bun was just ok and did get soggy / crumbly quickly as other reviewers have mentioned. Their signature zucchini fries (which were $3 on HH) were well seasoned but were nothing I'd ever crave (stop trying to capitalize on / reinvent North's zucca chips!). The onion rings were just ok (also HH), but not standout.

We probably would have been upset if we had paid full price or if we had waited 40 min for a table..."}
{"text":"Waitwr was great, food was awesome and quick.  You can reserve your table ahead of time through this Yelp App.  Super easy and got us into front of line."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  We got the samburger and it was not what i expected.   The zucchini fries were delicious though!   The service was excellent.   I would come back here and try something different.  It is pretty loud in here,  but it could be the group of loud kids sitting next to us,  unsupervised.   Poor server."}
{"text":"Went to zinburger tonite with my friend and her two grandchildren.  They were alittle slow in waiting on us, from then on they bent over backwards to help us and the final thing was they bought us supper,which they did not need to do.  I have gone there at least once a week and will continue to go there.   Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Zinburger is always a safe bet. This location has a friendly staff and the same quality that you'd expect. I'm never disappointed in any way coming here.

The truffle fries are a must and, if you haven't had them, definitely try one of the shakes after (or before) your meal."}
{"text":"I came in just before happy hour and the place was nearly empty when I arrived, which is what I was hoping for/expected on a weekday. I grabbed a table, propped open a book I had long been neglecting, and ordered a milkshake at the suggestion of my knowledgeable server whose name escapes me (I want to say Audrey/Aubrey?)

I had a hankering for something sweet and savory and found the Butterfinger shake to be just the right combination leaving me quite content. The consistency/temperature of the shake was near perfect. Solid enough to use the spoon, but smooth enough to use the straw, stayed cold the entire time, but never gave me brain freeze and I'm pretty sensitive. 

(Tip: Start by eating the candy pieces at the top to get your taste buds attuned to the flavor of your shake. Plus then you'll have less to dig for at the bottom when you finish)

I ordered a side of sweet potato fries because I'm a sucker for anything sweet potato and couldn't pass up an opportunity to take advantage of the half off happy hour menu. The fries arrived hot and crispy with a side of ketchup and a variation of tzatziki sauce. The first half was excellent and served at just the right temperature but the second half got soft from the steam and was significantly less enjoyable. Perhaps serving in a basket with less air exposure might help.  But for now if you're going solo or not in a sharing mood, then I'd advise eating quickly or maybe asking them to fry a little longer.

For an upscale \"burger\" chain, this place had a good vibe, a tasty menu, and great service.

Update: They also validate parking!"}
{"text":"I've been to Zinburger in Gilbert so we were happy to try their location in Scottsdale with family from out of town.  Boy, what a mistake - I was just not satisfied with the service or the food.  My sweet potato fries had an odd after taste and my bunless burger with avocado, egg and bacon had way too much cheese and the flavor of everything was just off. It took forever to get our food and when my husband ordered desert for the family, that took even longer to get.  Definitely will not be going back to this location - too crowded and terrible service. There are far better places to dine in the area, so Zinburger should step up its service!"}
{"text":"Zinburger I love you!! 
Came here for a double date with my bfs dad and had the best time stuffing me face with onion rings, samburger w no top bun and a strawberry milkshake. My bf ordered the kale Caesar with ahi which I highly recommend. I love the outdoor seating option. 
If you're in the area looking for burgers and salads hit up zinburger. 
I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great food, but the hour+ long waits to be seated sucks every single time. Once you are seated you are rushed to order, eat, and leave. 

The breakfast burger is good."}
{"text":"Zinburger has avreally good veggie patty that compliments any burger option. My first time there I had the California bowl with the veggie patty it was Really good! My second time going which was today I had the Bruce Lee with the veggie patty and I must say it was DELICIOUS!! My daughter ordered one to take home!! The truffel fries are ok I like my fries kinda soft they are border line chip fries but the taste is still really good! I will definitely keep this as one of my favorite spots to eat and relax the ambiance is really nice."}
{"text":"Some good some bad overall ok...Good milkshakes bad overly salted fries and dare I say disgusting ketchup...Good service bad ahi tuna sandwich....Stick with the burgers and shakes skip the french fries...or try the zucchini fries"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, but I've heard many good things about it.  It wasn't very busy considering we came at lunchtime on a Saturday.  The staff was very friendly and on top of everything.  We got the loaded fries and she asked if we wanted the brought out as an appetizer.  Best decision ever!  They were amazing - seasoned fries with bacon, sour cream, chives and an amazing cheese sauce.  Loved them and they were a perfect size to share with my wife.  But honestly I could have eaten the whole plate as my meal.  I had the Smasher, which was the house creation for the week.  I'm not sure why everyone doesn't already put mashed potatoes on a burger, but this creation was solid proof that it should be a thing.  Battered fried onions, mashed potatoes, gravy, mayo and a fresh beef patty.  It was one of the best burgers I've ever had.  It had a nice peppery hint that complemented the mashed potatoes.  My wife got the Ringer and really liked it.  I think we will be coming back to try more burgers."}
{"text":"Another good eats by Fox Group. A small place with the usual cool green color displayed throughout the Fox restaurants. Prices are very reasonable for both food & drinks. However, the bartenders attitude & service could've used a little improvement. But that's just a minor thing that can be overlooked if you're looking for good food. Try the Kobe beef with the truffle fries. Beer right from the tap is refreshingly cold. 

Good place for a late Sunday brunch..."}
{"text":"\"When people pile seven things onto one burger, it drives me nuts!\" ? Bobby Flay

Preach.

As I've gotten older, I have learned to appreciate the simplicity of thing.  That doesn't mean I can't get down on a burger with a fried egg on it but I wish I kept this in mind when I went to Zinburger and got the staple \"Zinburger.\"

I should have known from the beginning that my meal was going to be average when they served me my $8 Moscow Mule in a Collins/highball glass instead of the staple copper mug.  I got the Cucumber Basil Mule (Cucumber infused Smirnoff, torn basil, lime, and ginger beer) which seemingly had no alcohol in it.  Perhaps they thought I couldn't hold my own or maybe it's the fact that the bartender shakes the shaker with such enthusiasm, thus bruising the alcohol, but it ended up tasting more like ginger beer with basil chunks.  Bleh.  I need me my booze.

We next got our order of Double Truffle Fries ($6.50 -Truffle aioli, truffle oil, and Parmesan cheese).  These were great and tasty.  The fries were seasoned to perfection and the truffle aioli was spectacular.  Last to come out was my Zinburger ($10.50 - Manchego cheese, Zinfandel braised onions, lettuce, and mayo).  It was cooked medium rare as specified and had good flavor.  The meat itself was interesting.  It fell apart with the lightest of touch and felt more like meatloaf than an actual burger.  Pair that with a sloppy amount of braised onions and the texture of the overall burger wasn't pleasant.  So while grease and sweaty onions rained down from my burger, chunks of crumbled beef also poured down with every bite.  I ended up picking at it with knife and fork.  The only thing messier than the plate was the amount of grease and caramelized onions on my linen napkin.  Eeks!

All in all, I enjoyed the fries but that's the only thing I'd be back for.  They use to have a tasty kobe burger that they have since replaced with a grass-fed burger so there's really no reason for me to stop by again.  Still, it's a clean open eatery with ample seating."}
{"text":"Absolutely scrumptious!! My boyfriend and I were wondering were to go for dinner, we both agreed we wanted to try Zinburger! No regrets. We were warmly welcomed by our server who anticipated specials of the day. Being a big fan of blue cheese I went with \"my boy blue\", my boyfriend tried \"The Double\". Both juicy, messy, but DELICIOUS!! Our server recommended the spicy green chili fries...not enough spicy for my taste still I would order it again. Drinks were also good, go with the bacon Bloody Mary!!"}
{"text":"Solid food, but for a price.  We had the My Boy Blue and the Blanco Burger (each $11), along with an order of the truffle fries.  They were tasty, but they honestly didn't stand out much to me from other cheaper burger restaurants in the area (namely Harvey Wineburger).  I think you're paying a bit extra for the location (mall) and the knowledge that you're eating local ingredients.  When you add a couple drinks to your bill, you can easily spend over $50 for burgers and fries.

Good food, but a little too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"What a win for this mall to have this restaurant. I waited to get a seat outside on the patio to enjoy the sun, and it just made the experience perfect. I really enjoyed my beer while waiting for my boyfriend to meet me here for lunch. I got the Seared Ahi Tuna Sandwich per the recommendation of the waiter along with sweet potato fries, and it was quite delicious. I could easily come back and try another burger."}
{"text":"We had some issues with calling in and kind of made a scene, but the manager was the nicest guy ever and helped us out so we weren't late for prom. Can't thank him enough, service and food were outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We went for date night (without the kids) and couldn't have been more pleased!

Pros: truffle fries, zinburger, Latte Shake - everything we had was delicious! The burgers melted in your mouth. Really, the best ever. 

Cons: Price - it's not really a con if you are aware ahead of time. It's equivalent to Charlestons pricing. 

If you're looking for a cool, trendy, clean place to eat with even better food then the decor - go now!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing salads and sloppy joe (YUM!!), shakes, great service.  This location is usually packed on weekends and evenings, but fun places to walk around, close to iPic and splash pad.  Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Kobe burger and truffle oil fries are amazing! Our waiter JJ was amazing. He was super friendly and attentive. Make sure you ask for him by name if you want stellar service."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, I must admit I was a skeptic when my wife wanted to come here over the other highly rated downtown Gilbert restaurants. However, Zinburger blew us both away!

Service was friendly and efficient. Food took about 8 minutes to hit the table after ordering. 

I got the buffalo chicken sandwich, which is basically how I rate the quality of a burger/sandwich shop because I'm complete obsessed with Frank's hot sauce and would probably bathe in it if I had enough money to make that a possibility. They did not disappoint. It was a big piece of correctly fried chicken and a heaping amount of delicious toppings and sauce. It was amazing. 

Overall, I had nothing to complain about after the meal. Everything was spectacular and my wife agreed with my opinion. Will be back."}
{"text":"We ate at zinburger a few times. Both for lunch and once for dinner. 

We had just the milkshakes the first time and what can I say. They are to die for. Huge in flavour and the options you can get for $5 is crazy. Love them

The burgers were just the same. They have a huge selection of them and the fries are incredible. If we could have went back several more times we would have. 

Love this place"}
{"text":"Wow, we are so glad we found this \"burger\" land of bliss! Since we were only in town for a few days from LA, we were searching to find the best places to grab some lunch , and ZinBurger popped up on the cell,  and was nearby. From beginning to end our meal was perfectly delicious! The strawberry lemonade started our journey into food Heaven, and from that point on we became fans! We even asked our waitress Shannon if they had a Zin in the LA area that we could run to as soon as we got back home. Even though my husband was stuffed by the end of his meal, he still had to try the banana cream pie that Shannon suggested.  Oh and I don't even have to mention how delicious it was, by this point I'm sure you can tell they had us hooked! It was my husband's birthday and when  Shannon later found out, they gave us the birthday discount that we didn't even know we could get. Oh yeah, when we come back to the Phoenix area you can best believe we will be making a stop at Zin...again and again! #ZucchiniFriesAreKiller"}
{"text":"First time stop in at Zinburger and I have to say it was amazing ! The restaurant is very nicely decorated the seating is comfortable they had the windows open to let in a cool breeze . The wait staff is so friendly and really went above and beyond to make our first time visit exceptional . After noticing how truly large their burgers are we decide to order one to share , A delicious blue cheese burger and added bacon which was plenty with the loaded French fries we had . They also served us the burgers on two plates which to me is a touch above. My grandsons had the chicken strip and fries and they were cooked to perfection and I have to say I was a little jealous of how good they tasted. If you haven't tried this place you have too ;) you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers. The zinburger is to die for and the ahi tuna sandwich is out of this world. Fantastic food for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time, good burgers and the truffle fries are so good. Great service as well."}
{"text":"It's a sad, sad day when a truly tasty burger bar fails terribly in providing basic service! 

[I used to stop in frequently when I lived close by but sometimes things change and not always for the better]

Waited a good 15 min to get a menu after taking a seat at a nearly empty bar around 4:30p on the weekend, then another 10 min to get my drink. I gave my order to the bartender, but she completely forgot to put it into the kitchen. Meanwhile I witnessed others who ordered after me get their food. The bartender never made so much as eye contact with me even though I was trying to catch her attention about my beloved burger lol... So I flagged down a server to ask about my meal and it got walked directly to the kitchen.

Eventually the burger double stack came out and it was every bit as flavorful as the wait was long. As good as I remembered. It was topped with 3 slices of applewood bacon and side of pickles ($12). Oh happy belly!! 

The sweet potato fries on the other hand were small in proportion, dry, and didn't have much taste until I salted them on my own ($5). Maybe in a rush they forgot to season them? Oh well.

At no time did anyone ask how my meal was and at the end, not even an apology or concession for the lack of service/order mishap."}
{"text":"WOW! That Zinburger was something else. I am a sucker for Manchego cheese. Their fries were also unique and delicious. They even tasted great the next day. How many fries can pull that off?"}
{"text":"This place has the best burger I have ever tasted! The service is awesome as well! The bartender with reddish curly hair was amazing. I'm still giving it 5 stars even though the silverware and plate were dirty and the bar chairs were super uncomfortable. And the napkins looked stained and dirty and left lint on my pants. 

I highly recommend to try the zinburger! Made perfectly."}
{"text":"Okay so the burgers were good. Great variety, the toppings were delish, and the fries are good. The only reason for no 5 star is the buns are not good... They remind me of cheap fast food burger buns, but other than that everything was great.
I had the veggie burger--YUM!!
If you are looking for a good burger and don't want it quite as fancy as Deluxe, go here...they are good burgers!"}
{"text":"Very good,  we enjoyed sitting outside.   I had a great salad.  Vegetables kids ate for $3 (wow) and loved it.   The husband enjoyed his burger too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our one year of dating!(not into typical fancy steak dinners). 
I was impressed with the service, the vibe, and of course, the food. The waitress offered us the burger of the week which was their take on a Big Mac burger. And holy shit. It was a damn good burger. It's how I wish the Big Mac from McDonalds would actually taste like. I also highly recommend their truffle aioli fries. I took leftovers home and they were even good the next day. And if you're into shakes, their banana Royale literally tastes like banana split in a cup. So dang good."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Something for everyone.  I can get a juicy delicious perfectly cooked burger and my mom can get one of several delicious salads! Service always spot on at this location.  Our waiter Jonathon was friendly and fast!  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I'd never say that a fireplace could be a focal point for anywhere in arizona but the I would be wrong. 

As a local I do my best to stay away from places too touristy or upity and I've missed out Zinburger because of it. 

On a literally freezing January evening the fireplace was roaring at full blast literally calling my name. Having the opportunity to sit near it is not only enchanting but mesmerizing. Top it off with the dozen or so well gassed space heaters outside and I almost took layers off I was so comfortable. I recommend a cocktail or two to aid in increasing your body temperature, the dirty vodka martini and prickly pear margarita did the trick. 

We arrived with a wait of over an hour for inside seating, so my little tip of the day would be take first available and sit down outside in less than 15. The heat is ample and if you're already dressed for the elements, food and cocktails will be around soon enough you'll forget it's even a winter January in arizona. 

Food is umm delicious, love the shareable concept for sides and it's true my burger was delicious and succulent. They can literally make anything you want, so if the million of pre paired options don't hit the mark for ya; DIY.  

I hear it's great for the littles also, though on this trip I didn't bring my own mini I hear they give kids etchasketches in lieu of crayons or computers, that's a score for me. Matter of fact my mouth is watering thinking about my delicious diner and drinks, it may not be long before I return."}
{"text":"Great food! Takes all little time to bring the burger to your tavlbke, but wotlrth the wait.  We split the Diablo!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Zin. 

The only thing I have \"beef with\" (LOL) is how expensive it is. 

The fries are A La Carte but, I will say that they are definitely worth it! This is my go to spot for birthday dinners or date nights. 

I wish I was ballin' so hard that I could eat here on the reg but, that's what I get for choosing music ministry as my career path.

{"text":"Heard such good things about this place and finally decided to try it out. Our server forgot about us the whole time and focused on one of his tables more than anything.  As for the food I could've made a burger at home way better, for the price it was. Overall HorribleCustomer service and the food just as bad."}
{"text":"We really enjoy visiting this restaurant! The food and service are excellent. Tony the bartender is the best. He's always pleasant, helpful, professional and goes out of his way for his customers.  Thank you for your great service!"}
{"text":"This is another Sam Fox restaurant that won't let you down.  I really don't know if it matters what you order here, because it is all so tasty.  My favorites are the zucchini fries followed by the kale salad.  You will have to share the fries with your table mates because they are impossible to resist. The kale salad is perfect!  I make it at home, but this is even better.  If I am here for dinner and I have a little more hunger going on, then I order the boy blue burger.  They had me at blue cheese, and then they they serve it on a good sized bun that doesn't overpower the burger.  What great flavor! Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Great Burger but mediocre setting.... conveniently located in the shopping plaza.  The menu is stacked with a great selection, so when wanting to try a different type of well made burger, I would recommend."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to enjoy this place.  Great location in a modern building. The problem was more with the kitchen than anything else.

Came when there wasn't a crowd and was asked to sit inside or outside. Chose inside and was seated quickly in the middle of a long row of tables.  Waitress was very friendly and the service was quite good. We ordered and waited.

My stepdaughter had the Kobe burger and asked for it to be 'medium', it was rare. My girlfriend asked for the Turkey burger, it was under cooked with a soft white center and had to be sent back to the kitchen. I had the Samburger which as a burger with bacon on it. I asked for it to be medium rare and got it very rare.  I like rare anyway, but not what I had asked for. The buns were nice and soft and the flavor was ok.  On the bright side, the loaded fries were very good, according to my stepdaughter.

There is a lot of new competition in Gilbert and not performing well is not going to help. I am sure other Yelpers liked this place, but it will not be one of my top picks.  I will try it again in a month or two to see if they have fixed their kitchen. I can cook faster and better than these guys. AND, I am not classically trained."}

{"text":"My family and I came here on a Saturday around 2pm this last weekend. It was crowded inside and it didn't appear they were seating outside because it was so hot. We waited about 30 minutes, but unfortunately there wasn't much seating while we were waiting. I had to hold our carseat and sway to keep our 3 month old happy, but luckily it didn't get much more crowded by the door.

We were greeted by our waiter, who was fantastic. We ordered our burgers, I got the Zinburger, my wife got the Bruce Lee (daily special?), and  we shared the All-American fries. The fries tasted great, but were VERY cheesy, almost too cheesy. I also think they forgot the chives, because I didn't see any green on those things. My Zinburger tasted fine. It was cooked to perfection but the onions were really sweet and overpowered the burger. The actual patty was delicious, but I could hardly taste it most of the time. My wife enjoyed her burger as well, but had the same frustration. There was too much stuff on it and it overpowered the Kobe beef.

The problem I had was about 4 hours later I had the WORST food poisoning in my life. Over the last two days I have had to be within 10 steps of a restroom. $45 for this... it means I won't likely be back."}
{"text":"Came in Saturday and the wait was long which was fine. Once we sat down I made sure to order an \"extra well done burger\" and 20 min later I got a burger that was half pink. Otherwise, when they cook the food correctly the place is amazing, however when they are busy Zinburger doesn't seem to care."}
{"text":"disappointing. the burgers aren't worth the price"}
{"text":"So you have to ask yourself...is $50 ($60 with tip) for 2 burgers, one small salad, one order of zucchini fries and 2 sodas a good buy.  If so, then this may be the place for you.  If not...keep on going.

So about the food...

- Burgers -- good but not remarkable.  
- Small chopped wedge salad --  pretty good actually.  
- Zucchini fries -- Ok.  That being said, you really can't turn zucchini into \"fries.\"  What you actually end up with is strips of zucchini coated in breadcrumbs (or whatever it was) that cooks up somewhat crisp with zucchini inside that ends up being somewhat flaccid.
- Soda -- soda is soda.

For whatever reason the restrooms are located outside the restaurant...kind of like a gas station.  Not sure why or how that design choice was made, but it almost seems like they built the building and realized they forgot to put in a bathroom.  Not smart.

The seating in the restaurant is odd at best, horrible at worst.  The have some bar height tables with chairs that have low backs...not the most comfortable.  The rest of the interior has tables with long bench seats and what looks to be metal chairs.  I don't like long bench seats and I've yet to find a metal chair that is comfortable.  The outside seating area is similar.

The wait staff seemed pretty switched on.  However, we were asked if we wanted our salad and zucchini fries first followed by the burgers.  The salad and fries did show up first...immediately followed by the burgers.

Not sure I'll be back as I just didn't see the value in going.  That being said I'm sure they'll be wildly successful given their old town Gilbert location.

Not a 3 and not a solid 2...mostly a 2.5 but I'm not going to round up."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The service has always been excellent and the food comes very quickly.  The burgers are always cooked perfectly and love those sweet potato and truffle fries.  Blanco burger, Diablo burger and custom burgers are always great.  Farm salad is great as well."}

{"text":"Manager Ashley Moorer saved what have would otherwise have been a disastrous experience for us tonight at Zinburger. 

The restaurant is a featured player in the current Arizona Restaurant Week promotion - and they were completely unprepared for how much business this promotion would draw. As a result, we had to wait 25 minutes for a table. Interestingly - it was interesting when you weren't the one waiting for the table - tables inside and outside would be cleared, and then it would take anywhere from 15 minutes to a half-hour for people to be seated at those tables ... even though the wait appeared to have gone from 25 minutes to nearly an hour.

Our server was adequate, but just. 

Good news is that the food (Zinburger, Samburger, yogurt-dill dip for the sweet potato fries, and chocolate cream pie) really did live up to the acclaim. 

In the name of efficiency, we placed our dessert order with our food order, hoping to make an 8 p.m. comedy performance. It was not to be. The fries came ahead of the burgers - as an appetizer? - but the burgers took at least 20 minutes to appear. Then, the interminable wait for the dessert begain.

The waiter wandered by, said the dessert order would  be out momentarily. Ten minutes passed. The waiter apologized, saying the dessert station was backed up. Ten more minutes passed. The waiter went to look in on our dessert again. Two slices of chocolate cream pie. Not chocolate soufle - just plain old chocolate cream pie.

Finally - someone other than the server brought the pie. And, immediately after that, the manager herself came over to see us. Which means the waiter, who we thought was doing a pretty poor job all along, had the foresight to get his manager involved.

She explained that the staff had been overwhelmed with the Restaurant Week response, but she knew it wasn't an excuse. To make amends, she offered us free dessert on a future visit. I told her the food was good, but not nearly good enough to warrant the wait - and that we probably would not be returning to the restaurant in the future. That was when she stepped up and offered to treat us on the house - and serve us herself! - if we'd be willing to give her another try.

Also, she comped tonight's bill.

All in all, stellar performance by a manager who wanted to make things right for unhappy customers.

And, as I told my boyfriend, it's likely good news for all the coming Restaurant Week patrons, as there's no excuse, going forward, for the poor service.

Thanks, Ashley Moorer. You saved the day!"}

The drinks sounded great but I did not indulge. They have malted drinks and fancy fun cocktails. Chocolate Sangria anyone? Pomagranite, Pineapple Cosmo, Creme Brulee milk shakes. Hello? yummers- but I am only guessing. These drinks sure sound good though."}
{"text":"I lived in San Francisco for the past year and a half, and I can confidently say that I never had a single burger there that compares to anything at Zinburger. The quality of the meat just seem superior.

I'd probably go with El Diablo, the Breakfast Burger, or their namesake--the Zinburger. Also, the salads are great, which I never would have expected. And the shakes are full-on desserts. Everything at Zinburger seems artfully crafted. Very impressed.

Whenever I have friends in town, I recommend that they grab a burger. And that's saying something coming from a very health-conscious guy."}
{"text":"This was possibly the best burger I've ever had.  At least tied with the best.  I went simple with my burger because I wanted to taste the actual meat.  Great choice!  The fries were also awesome.  Slightly messy but such is expected.  Great atmosphere and polite wait staff.

Update:  I have been back and everything still stands true.  Yum!

Update 2: Yep, I upped this to 5 stars.  This is definitely the place to go for the best burgers in town.  I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Usually a FRC place is a pretty safe bet for me.  Unfortunately, I didn't really feel that way about Zinburger.  On the particular day we chose to visit Zinburger, we had already eaten and True Food, just down the way, went to a movie, and then it was time to eat again.  Since we weren't terribly hungry, but the opportunity to eat again wouldn't present itself for a while, we decided to share some food here.

We each got a shake and then the Samburger (a bacon burger) and the sweet potato fries to split.  My shake was fantastic.  I got the creme brulee shake.  If my review was based solely off of my shake, this would be a 5 star review, but it's not.  The sweet potato fries were good, but only without the sauce.  I honestly thought the yogurt sauce was disgusting and inappropriately paired with the fries.  Something sweeter would have made more sense.  The burger was, well, just a burger.  I was sad that it wasn't anything special.  It didn't taste any better than anything else I have had before.  Too bad.

Unfortunately, our service here was awful.  Harold, or whatever his name is, was rude and snotty and pretty much ignored us for most of our meal while he chit chatted and shmoozed other tables.  He definitely showed his displeasure that we were splitting our food, making our bill smaller.  I do also have to make mention of the inappropriate placement of the hinges on the men's restroom door.  Read Glenn's review for a more thorough account, but yeah, it was gross.  Thankfully Debbie Porter informed me that they were installing a screen or something to fix the problem.  For future diner's sake, I hope so.  

The more I think about it, the more I am sure I won't be back.  There are just way too many other burger joints around town to try and revisit."}
{"text":"Always order Breakfast Burger which has burger, bacon, fried egg, avocado and lots of yummy.

Probably one of my favorite burgers in Arizona.

For some reason, this location. In particular has had some service by issues, unlike the one at the Biltmore.

One time we ordered Zucchini Fries and we had to ask 3 times before we received the Zucchini Fries and at that time we were almost done eating.

I hate knocking down a restaurant in ratings because of service, but it has happened about two or three times."}
{"text":"one of our favorite places for burgers. breakfast burger with fried egg an bacon is so good"}
{"text":"Awesomeness!  So glad Sam Fox opened the Zinburger at the Scottsdale Quarter Shopping area. Hopefully he will open more of his restaurants in the area besides True Food Kitchen and Sauce down the road.

Great service always nice dining area, even with the cow murals. :)

Great selection of burgers,  fries and shakes. Watch oit for the burger of the month, usually some very creative concoction. My personal favorite burger is the Breakfast Burger, has fried egg, Applewood Bacon, avocado, lettuce with mayo. Warning! It gets pretty messy so be prepared for a few napkins. The only thing negative is if you don't eat it in a timely manner the bun gets soggy, take this ad a suggestion Zinburger,  offer a Pretzel Bun.  If they had a pretzel bun this could be the best burger in town.

The fries are delish,  love the hand cut fries and the zucchini fries are awesome.  Zucchini Fries almost remind me of the old deep fried zucchini from Lunt Ave Marble Co for you people that have lived in Phoenix for awhile. 

The shakes are also very good, can't miss getting the cookies and cream or Nutella Hazelnut Crunch.

One of the top five places for burgers in Phoenix.  

Try to get the Sam Fox Gift Cards from Costco - $100 worth of food for $79 and get on their mailing list for holiday 25% off.

Will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"I have only been here a few times, so I may have to give it another try. Buuuuut I just find it so hyped for not much reason. The burgers are average. I had the \"Breakfast\" burger. Sounds delicious, tastes not delicious. The egg had a very strange, fake taste to it. The veggie burger was also a bit of a disappointment the second time I went. They make a good root beer beer float with the \"Not Your Father's\", so thats  one thing! Service can be slow since it's almost ALWAYS busy there."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Very moist meat and the topping were all fresh and full of flavor. I also got a side of the fries and a shake. The fries were crispy and lightly salted. Very tasty. I got the butterfingers shake and it was thick with just the right amount of butterfinger pieces in it. The only thing that was slightly lacking was service. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable, however when we asked for extras (ketchup, ranch etc...) it did take awhile before she came back with them. It also too her awhile to get me a refill on my drink. Other than that it was great and everyone was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine a reason I would ever come back.

When we arrived on a Sunday evening around 5:45PM we were told there was a 20 minute wait.  30 minutes later, we were checking our place in line while we stood there watching tables not be cleaned.  No fewer than 3 tables sat uncleaned for 15 minutes fully visible from the customer waiting area (one of them was the FIRST table you see, and always had staff passing by/milling around it/not cleaning up/not seating customers).  So this started off as a bad impression, as you may imagine.

When we were seated, finally, the waitress took our order and that was fine.  We proceeded to wait far too long for what arrived:  A horribly prepared chicken sandwich that sharted it's ingredients all over the plate at first bite (hey guess what? pound of the breast of chicken or slice it so we can actually take bites with all of the ingredients together not a huge bite of chicken breast and then another with only condiments... seriously the preparation was GARBAGE here.  Subway does better), a mediocre burger for my dining partner, and cold French fries.  My chicken sandwich was also cold, though I doubt heat would improve anything... but it should be noted that the reason the food took so long to come out is because it just wasn't being delivered properly.  The kitchen no doubt had the chicken sandwich and fries ready at the same time, because they were about the same level of cold when I got them.  

So after looking at my chicken sandwich ingredients all over my plate, I decide to eat it like a salad... until... I couldn't.  A foot-long fake-red-dyed hair was pulled from my mouth.  I could feel it in the back of my throat gagging me as I pulled it out.  It was absolutely disgusting.  I covered my plate with my napkin, pushed it away, and didn't touch anything else.  When the waitress came by, I informed her of the situation and asked it be removed from the cheque which I would very much like to receive right now.  She said she would get the manager.  Ugh, whatever, let's just speed this along because I want to leave. 

 After a good 5 or so minutes the manager comes by.  Now this is particularly interesting because it makes me wonder what took so long.  Was she insuring quality, hot, well prepared food in the kitchen?  Hmm, doesn't seem so.  Was she making sure the front-of-house was properly sorted and tables were being turned quickly?  Hmm, obviously not.  So what WAS she doing all that time?!  I made it clear I wanted to go.  So the manager comes over, asks if there is anything she can get me \"I asked for the cheque with this removed.\"  So she asks, AGAIN, if she can remake my food... what the? Are you kidding me?!  That actually made me pretty angry, I've already explained TWICE what I want and now instead of giving it to me you are holding me captive and questioning what I feel like putting in my body tonight?!  Is this real life?!  What an absolute nightmare, when your customers very clearly tell you what they want if it is at all within your power YOU JUST DELIVER IT.  You should have come with the cheque in your hand, you should not have asked the waitress to bring it by, here's why:

The waitress, knowing likely she wasn't going to get a fat tip, saunters by probably another 5 minutes later and drops off the cheque.  Immediately we put down a card, she snaps it up... then walks to the next table of 8 people to take their order.  In painful detail.  While looking over at us on occasion... really?  So after about 10 minutes of this, and ANOTHER 10 minutes of entering their order she finally brings back the swiped card receipt to sign.  Unbelievable, you should be fired for that behavior because not a single person in the world would believe it wasn't intentional.  You have a job to do no matter how you happen to feel about it in the moment, don't be garbage to your customers because of your emotions and feelings.  This is so unprofessional and leads to things like this review, so good work representing your company so well!  

So this all leads to one thing:  Awful management.  If it was just the server, fine... but it was the hostess, the bus staff, the food delivery, the food itself... all of it.  Clearly this manager has zero control over this place and you should all do well to avoid it so you don't have suffer through garbage hair-filled food, cold fries (which we STILL had to pay for even though we didn't eat them and they scooped them off the table without asking if we were done... which is basically theft but whatever I just wanted to leave at that point) and everything else that is so horribly wrong about this restaurant and this location.

Avoid.  Boycott.  Trash online.  Do your worst, Zinburger clearly serves up theirs."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with co-workers and tried the MVB which was a kobe beef burger with avocado and bacon. Really good burger and accompanied it with the works fries and although the calorie intake was pretty long, it was worth every bit. On the pricier side for a burger at 10-15 bucks, but if looking for a quality burger. Look no further"}
{"text":"Three different burgers, three different shakes....everyone walked away from the table satisfied.  I like my hamburgers Med-Rare and this is one place where I am not afraid to order it that way.  I have been here 7-9 times over the last year and have never had a bad experience.  (Order the fries... ;-)...)"}
{"text":"This place has become our go-to burger place! Each time we go here, I can't seem to order anything else besides the Zinburger and I don't even like onions. It must be something about them soaked in wine :) Last visit I did try it low-carb style, without the bun, and it was definitely missing something so I'll just have to workout extra hard when I know this place is on tap for dinner. We also enjoy their zucchini fries with ranch, a lot...but I've had them three different times and each time have been different. Time number 2 was absolutely the best but I can't put my finger on what is happening different. This place is usually fairly busy and it can make service a bit impersonal and a smidgen slow but we've always gotten everything out without too long of a wait. I've also tried one of their shakes but honestly, can't really remember what it was so it wasn't too memorable. Overall, a great, casual place for lunch or dinner. Love the patio too!"}
{"text":"Meh. Very spotty service. We were at the bar and pretty much invisible. Took 50 + minutes to get the food -  pretty simple Sam Burger and veggie burger. No real reason or apology given. Typical lunch afternoon crowd...busy but not crazy. Food was prepared properly and tasted good but the service pretty much said it all. I like Sam Fox restaurants but I'm thinking this one needs an overhaul in management. No excuses for this lackluster staff."}
{"text":"For a nice looking place with cheerful service and delicious food, I'm not exactly all in. As others have outlined ,  the a la carte setup is pricey for what you get. Burgers are decent sized and lovely, but they're not gigantic, and sans sides, I'd stop well short of calling one \"a meal\".  I'm hardly a power eater and could've downed two fairly easily. 

We had two of their cheapest burgers, fish sandwich, a shake, glass of wine, Diet Coke and split an order of fries. After tip it was $70, and you kinda ask yourself \"Am I really in a burger & shake place, or maybe something pretending to be?\" 

Example. The menu doesnt list soft drinks, presumably to push the more expensive shakes and wines. Of course I got my Coke anyway, without a hint of attitude, which was nice. But at a corporate level, something about that rubs me the wrong way. The \"idea\" that ordering a Coke at a burger and shake place isnt on, or by implication \"with\", The Program. 

It's Fox all the way. Pretty setting, friendly but inexperienced service, fun menu, generally tasty and overpriced food. Sharing plates or cutting expenses at happy hour might make it a more attractive option."}
