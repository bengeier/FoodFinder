{"text":"By far, the best wings around! Excellent customer service too. Keep up the good job!!"}
{"text":"This is not based on any facts, but I think the wings here are frozen? They weren't crispy and they were really small... Kind of reminded me of the wings you get when you order pizza.

The skin was kind of mushy actually from all the sauce they put on them... For a place that boasts an abundance of sauces, it's ridiculous how you can only order 3 different sauces when you're placing an order for 50 wings! And the heat level in their wings is also kind of weak. Would not recommend..."}
{"text":"Wings here are pretty expensive and not worth the price however, I have to commend the staff. There's one gentleman in particular, not sure if he's the owner of the franchise or a waiter but he's incredibly warm and friendly. I came in and ordered two flavours of wings. Two mins later, he came back with tiny plastic cups with different herbs and spices and told me that if I was okay with it, he'd recommend better flavours since the two I chose were very similar in taste. The restaurant wasn't busy at the time so I sat there and tasted multiple flavours. He asked me what I liked and brought out flavours accordingly. I wish I had gotten his name! Honestly, I would most likely not eat at Wild Wing again but if I had to, I'd come back to this location because of the service from this particular gentleman."}
{"text":"I generally don't have a problem with chains, but I really don't understand how Wild Wing keeps expanding. The restaurant itself is cramped, the wings are small, and the flavours leave a lot to be desired. Sure, there is a huge list of flavours, but I've tried about five of them and didn't like any. There are lots of great wing places in Markham (see my Markham pub list), so don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Like this chain but don't like this location. Way too small and we got frozen jalapeno poppers for appetizer."}
{"text":"Very gloomy looking place. Looked like I stepped into an old tavern from the wild west.

Tried the poutine which had gravy, cheese and bacon $8.49 - The fries tasted as if they were frozen. The gravy and bacon wasn't that much better. Avoid and stick with the wings in which they are suppose to specialize in.

Garlic dry rub wings $10.99 - very salty but tasted okay.

Sour cream dry rub wings $10.99 - had the exact wings 2 weeks ago at another location. I liked them so much I ordered them again here."}
{"text":"You've got a few options when it comes to sports bars / bar food but this location is really not a good one.  I've been to a few different locations and they're all so incredibly mediocre.

To start, the inside looks really old and in need of polishing up.  One time I went, the table wasn't balanced on one side.  The bar area looks like it's in alright shape but I guess that's the main attraction.  An example of how old their inside is is that they had a Mike Komisarek poster for Leafs TV up... he's been gone since 2013.  Another one is I noticed that the TV near the door wasn't working properly (the picture only half showed and it was discoloured)

Wild Wing boasts how they have 101 flavours for their wings and my girlfriend and her friend seemed to like the ones they got.  I usually get plain wings and they're generally alright.  Only problem is when you get a single order, which comes with fries, they give you so little... we're talking a potato's worth.  It's pretty sad.  I ended up going again with my girlfriend and we split a double order of wings with a poutine and the portion for those fries was so much better... we got way more than double the amount of fries.  But the gravy was leaking through the paper/basket and it was way more messy than they needed to be.  Their gravy's pretty average and the cheese isn't anything special.  Their food is kind of expensive but that's expected of bar food.  I found the single order to be way under what it's worth though because the side portion was awful.

The wait staff isn't bad by any means so no complaints there.

If you want to eat bar food, you have better options, especially if this is the closest location to you.  They have locations at Markham Main Street / Bur Oak and Major Mac / Kennedy and both are a lot nicer, but the franchise in general has been pretty unimpressive to me.  So I'd say avoid this location (at the very least)."}
{"text":"You know what you're getting when you come to Wild Wing/All-Star/St. Louis.  Lots of wing flavours and a variety of fry platters (garlic parm, chili, poutine, etc.).

This location is slightly larger than the popular All-Stars at 16th & Woodbine.  Prices are about the same.

Good service throughout the night and there were plenty of TV's around so you can catch the Leafs/Raptors."}
{"text":"I've been to a few wild wings, and since I was in the area and hungry, I said let me pass by this one.

First, I didn't feel super welcome. I sat down, but the staff was generally talking to a guy (flirting) with her. I was hungry, and I usually know what I want.

When she came, I ordered my garpar wings and a beer. The wings came and tasted a little too much breaded. Beer was good, it was a ricards red. 

I would not go back unless I was super hungry and it was on my way. But considering some of the wild wings I go to, this one didn't fare well with me"}
{"text":"Lots of wings, lots of variety, poutine with bacon and salads. Over a hundred styles of wing, some hot ones, mustard, thai, ranch, etc. You name it, they probably have it. 

Prices, well, go in a group, then it won't be that bad. Lots of parking. Located within the newish Boxgrove plaza."}
