{"text":"The small restaurant has no looks from the outside. Although the small terras is relatively quiet for a place like Montreal.
Mister/chef Lui is very friendly and he serves the plates with a touching enthousiasm. We had the house-specials. They were good!
Excellent price-quality! We (famliy of 4 adults) would go here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Both the banh mi and pho are great - extremely fresh and well-seasoned, and the owner is a lovely man who truly seems to enjoy seeing people enjoy his food. There's a sweet little patio out front that's a nice quiet place to sit and drink a beer, but because it's at the end of the street, a lot of people miss this gem. Go here! Even though I'm there at least once a week, I can't keep it in business by myself."}
{"text":"Miss the 20/20 days... The food was better when it was on paper/foam plates and plastic knives... It feels too fancied up now. Same food but less filling and more pricey than it used to be."}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese food. It's not the best of Montreal, but it's the best I've had around my workplace. Well worth it to escape those food courts. Prices are very reasonable, around 12$ for lunch and they include a soup, an imperial roll and the dish.

The place is clean, they have a small outdoor section and the staff is very friendly. I'm sure to go back many times for lunch!"}
{"text":"I really love this place a lot. The Sub sandwich is cheap and crunchy and creamy and spicy and delectable. It has the best imperial roll I've tried in Montreal. The fried dumplings are sinfully good. If that wasn't enough the owners are the most charming couple I've met in my life and it's a super warm atmosphere. A cheap, good food option around Concordia not enough people know about."}
{"text":"Had the wonton soup and pork chop with egg and rice. Not bad, but nothing to rave about either. Good cost-performance at 10 dollars for what I have got."}
{"text":"Great option for pho in the downtown area, good broth for Montreal overall. Good value and convenience. It gets busy at lunchtime for the work crowd but service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Very good. Really nice staff.When I asked if Pho Ga was on the menu (it was not), the waiter just offered to make it without a thought, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience in Montreal and our expectations were high. My wife and I were met by the owner who seemed very eager to please us. He quickly pointed out the evening's specials which included won ton soup and a Vietnamese plate of the customary fare. Now I'm no Asian culinary expert but isn't won ton soup Chinese? Just sayin'.
The soup was rather enjoyable despite its shady lineage. Soon thereafter the Vietnamese plates arrived replete with sliced egg rolls, thin slices of fried chicken for me, shrimp skewers for her and the requisite vermicelli noodles with hot/sweet sauce. The shrimp were shrimpy and the chicken was greasy. The owner wanted us to know that his egg rolls had once received attention for being Montreal's best. The were indeed satisfyingly crunchy and yet lacked any distinct or unique taste. In all our meal was 80% ...forgettable.
The restaurant is located in a basement with only minimal ambiance."}
{"text":"Very good and tasty food.  The service is great, the hostess is super attentive.    Price is affordable especially considering they are in the middle of downtown Montreal.  The place is clean and they accept credit card.
Based on the hostess' recommendation, my husband ordered Meal \"A\" which comes with soup, egg roll, grilled chicken and vermicelli noodles for $12.95.  I had grilled pork chop with white rice for less than $10.  Both meals are excellent and service was fast.  The only thing I didn't like is the dessert.  The rainbow cup which, she said was very popular, is not good at all and expensive at $3.50 for a small cup of coconut milk with red beans, corn and strings of green jello.  All in all, a great place to eat as long as you don't order dessert and you're okay with \"very casual\" dining."}
{"text":"Wanted something different than poutine, sandwiches and pizza. Headed here as it was close to our hotel and was vietnamese food.

Walking downstairs and into the restaurant you kind of feel like you were warped into a different place. Totally not city or montreal like, except the menus have french in them.

Was a bit excited to see what Vietnamese food is like in Montreal. The menu has a good mix of dishes including some that aren't very well known like Mi Quang. I wanted something homey feeling so I got the rice plate with pork and shredded pork. Pork chop was too salty. Rice wasn't the broken rice. The others in my party had same experience. Nothing very good. 
Meh is the correct word for this place."}
{"text":"La nourriture est toujours succulente, abondante et abordable. Le service est parfait. Belle et rare option pour un repas de qualité pas cher au centre-ville."}
{"text":"Good pho, I prefer my broth a little stronger on the spices and the beefiness, but que sera sera.

Decent prices, good service.

A can't miss, like nearly every other viet restaurant i've ever been in."}
{"text":"If you need to have Vietnamese food while you are in downtown Montreal, this place might be a good option.  I tried pho, kungpao chicken and emperor roll (spring roll).  Pho stock was pretty good. Portion was same as small size for US but with a vermicelli noodle (not typical pho noodle)... so as soon as I try to grab noodles in the soup, all are broken up..

Kungpao chicken was their special but I don't recommend it as it was nothing different from cheap Chinese dish. 

Very friendly/attentive service.  

PS: The restaurant is in half-basement level but it's bright."}
{"text":"I've had the Raw Beef Pho (with beef that was very much cooked), Pork Bhan Mi, and Chicken Bhan Mi. I've enjoyed all the dishes (even the overcooked beef) and feel like this is really what simple food is all about. There's no fussy sauces or fusion ingredients, and that's exactly what I want when I am craving something that a grandmother would make me - and in this case, she would of course, be Vietnamese. The pork in the sandwich was different to the traditional mix of cold-cuts/pâté that you'd normally find, it was more of a grilled pork, if I'm not mistaken. They were both heartier versions of the traditional Vietnamese sub sandwich. The noodle soup's broth had depth and good flavor to it, and I didn't feel like adding much to it besides a squeeze of lime and a dash of Hoisin.
The prices are more than reasonable, so it's really a fantastic alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Food quality was good. Had the goi cuon, fresh and authentic. The bun bo hue has pho noodles and most likely beef broth from pho as well, Not authentic and disappointing. A lot of restaurants do that to have variety on the menu I guess. They didn't have fish sauce either and served some kind of weird sauce that I think was some type of hoisin sauce. It was clean and the service was good so if your aren't Vietnamese or don't know authentic tastes it will be good. I also didn't try the pho which is probably the main dish anyway. I'll have to try it next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Cheap. Tasty. Personal service. This place is freaking good. I mean, where else can you order great authentic Vietnamese food? Vietnam? Yeah...right."}
{"text":"Best PHO I have had in Montreal so far.  You can't go wrong here with the fresh ingredients  and authentic broth. I'm spoiled by the many amazing Vietnamese restaurants in New York City, but whenever I'm in town I make sure to drop by to say hi to the friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was very happily surprised by this place! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's clean and friendly on the inside. I found the food to be wonderful, simple and satisfying Vietnamese fare. I got the banh mi (for five bucks) and was very happy with it."}
{"text":"This is my first time to Montreal...so, I wanted to get fix of Pho.  So, I decided to go to this restaurant regardless of some of the bad reviews I read regarding this restaurant.  I ordered the Beef Curry Pho...it was differently made to what I'm used to eating in Dallas, Texas.  But, it was actually very good!  If I come to Montreal again, this is one of the restaurants I want to come to again just to order this bowl of Pho.  

Note:  You need to tell the person that you want it SPICY!  The locals don't seem to like hot foods...at least not like us Texans!  lol!  :)

Note:  The place is small, and cozy...don't expect it be a place where you need to dress up to impress.  It's a casual place."}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap meal that will probably cost you under 10$ - Certainly for lunch.

Walking into this basement restaurant you start to wonder what are you getting yourself into. The decor is very basic - chairs are mismatched and I believe this is truly what gives the restaurant it's feel. 

The grilled meats here are good, served with rice and great imperial rolls.

Caters to both the local students, and business crowd from the area offices."}
{"text":"3 stars, with a 4th for the lovely gent that served us.  

Went to this (and several other) places based on Yelp recommendations.  Had the option of sitting outside, of which we gladly obliged.  The server was well versed in Filipino, and it surprised us a bit.  And it left me a bit ashamed.  But I digress.

The spring roll was utterly amazing.  Perfectly fried to a melt in mouth consistency.  We both had the pho, which was both good and bad.  Good, in that the pho was good.  Not great, but good.  Bad, in that we both got the same thing.  A better choice would have been (based on other reviews) the banh mi and some pho.  The pho has a generous helping of meat, but perhaps needed some more fish sauce ... or something.  Was good, but I think was missing a little something.  

Service was excellent.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"The restaurant doesn't look like much in it windowless basement. As usual the low brow Asian restaurants in Montreal seem to be squatting in a failed and former French Bistro with some added Asian art on the walls and a Buddha statue with offerings of apples. The gracious and polite owners can barely articulate English and even French, their second language in Viet Nam, but then I often have difficulties of my own understanding coarse accents. But we can always end up understanding each other and getting the business done. I give them cash and in return I get awesome delicious food.

I think this review might be unfair as I only order one thing off the menu. That is the ridiculously delicious Banh Mi sandwich. Their Banh Mi deviates from the traditional Bahn Mi. But it doesn't matter. Usually Banh Mis are meat (pork, chicken, sausage, whatever) served with pickled carrots and daikon, cukes, cilantro, chili peppers, some kind of paté with mayo in a French baguette. This is a throwback to French colonial days. I always try to get mine mild, so out go the chilli sauce and or peppers. And I love that hoagie, with a passion. I tell everyone to try it. In fact I order them to get one of these brilliant sammies.

However at Caravelle they have a different take on it. They don't have the tasty paté and the pickled veggies are replaced with a slaw of carrots and cabbage. Normally the pickled daikon rocks my world. But here, the simpler Banh Mi is still one serious delicious treat, inexpensive and always fresh. Even though I rapidly munch down the real foot long sub, I never feel bloated like one does eating a hefty sandwich, I feel rather refreshed. So I love it for both it amazing taste and the no-side effects. I dunno what it is about Banh Mis but I could easily eat them daily and never get bored and always find a new taste or texture to them. 

Cheap quality eats with a coke for about 7$, now that's a lunch I can live with considering the rest of the restaurants never let me go without taking at least 20$ from my wallet. So anyone working near this spot, it is your duty to get this delicious Banh Mi sammy."}
{"text":"As a tourist, it was pretty good. I was hoping for a more spiced broth and more tender brisket, but it hit the spot and the service was good."}
