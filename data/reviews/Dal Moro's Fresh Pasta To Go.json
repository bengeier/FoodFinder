{"text":"I am Italian, so I tend to avoid eating pasta cooked by anyone else. After reading about Dal Moro's in Venice, I was curious to try it out. In short: very impressive! Head there if you want authentic Italian pasta that's perfectly cooked. Shoutout to Gabrielle and the staff for the warm service. I will be back."}
{"text":"The star here is the pasta, freshly made in-house. And you do need to wait about 10 minutes while they prepare your order. This is not fast food nor is it cheap. But it is incredibly good. It says 'to go' in their name but there are a few tables inside and if you want to enjoy your order at its best, take a few moments to sit and enjoy the food. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not as great as the one in Venice! Maybe it's just growing pains for now but when we went around 9:00pm on a weekend, we waited a ridiculously long time for \"quick-serve\" pasta. Honestly, we would have left the line had we known that it would take 30 minutes to get through maybe 8 people ahead of us. 

Also I have a bone to pick with Dal Moro's in Toronto- they don't offer hot dogs as a topping! The Asian immigrant in me loves putting mystery meat in everything. 

The pasta is still fresh though and it's nice that you can choose your own toppings. Willing to go back to try again."}
{"text":"Found this cute little place.... and to my surprise its a pasta place with a build your own pasta option. I have tried the fusilli pasta with pomodoro sause and the other one with pesto..both are so flavourful and i can say they are fresh ... prepared right from the scratch...Tiramisu is fantastic."}
{"text":"4 stars for the nostalgia this restaurant brings. I have only written 2 other reviews online. Dal Moro's was the first meal I had on my first European trip. This place holds a special place in my heart. The Venice location is tucked away in an alley after finding your way from Piazza San Marco around winding streets and pretty canals. The owner was lovely and humble as to how highly rated his place already was on Travelocity. The pasta was one of the best meals I ate in my trip around Italy. I often think about Venice and the pasta. I visited the Toronto outpost with tremendous expectation and emotion. It was good but not up to my perhaps glorified memories. Gnocchi was not available on Sundays even though I called ahead and was informed it would be on the weekends. Food took a very long time to come out. Other customers' orders were incorrect, but a staff member cared very much about the business and apologized for the numerous errors. I don't mind waiting a while or being served a different pasta than I orderd, but the taste and the portion were inferior to Italy. I realize that the ingredients would be different in Toronto. I am going back again hoping they have gnocchi and giving it another try as I have fond memories and raved the others of their Venice location."}
{"text":"Perfectly al dente when fresh, but this pasta is more of \"To Eat&Go\" rather than \"To Go\" food. I would actually give this a 3.5/5. 

I ordered the fettuccine with frutti di mare sauce, mushrooms, mozzarella, and parmesan. The first bite was good and was packed with a rich seafood flavour. My boyfriend got the spaghetti with pesto sauce and added parmesan, which was also good and nutty (they add pine nuts on top). We brought it to-go and ate it after 20 minutes, but my pasta clumped up at the bottom and softened from all the heat trapped in the container. I would NOT recommend taking this to go for a long distance, since the quality of the food really does go down. However, the quantity of the pasta is really good - they pack a lot in that container! 

Overall, good service and pasta, but not really takeaway food - the server recommend to only keep it packed in the container for 15 minutes otherwise it does clump.

Note: I've also been to the one in Venice, which I LOVED and I don't think this restaurant does it justice, but it is still good pasta. 

Tips: Don't add any proteins if you get the frutti di mare sauce - there's already a lot of seafood in it! I would try to sit in and eat at the restaurant rather than take it away."}
{"text":"Honestly I think my order was just a unique case where the orders came out awful. I think it deserves a second chance to see if it was just this one incident but I don't think I'd want to come again to give it a second chance. 

The problems were in the sauces. The pastas were decent. My boyfriend and I ordered the carbonara and it was not creamy or flavorful. We also ordered the squid ink pasta and that was WAY too salty. We finished two bottles of water before we could even finish half of that container. 

I hate wasting food but it was so unappetizing and almost painful to eat so a overly bland pasta with an overly salty one that we had to toss them away before we finished. We could've definitely told the staff about this but had already made a dent in both boxes so we didn't want to see annoying. I'm sure this place is actually great and we had an off case based on other reviews but yeah..."}
{"text":"I ordered the carbonara and my friend ordered the squid ink. My pasta was good but not extraordinary. The container looks small but there is a heaping quantity- definitely leaving you full and satisfied.

My only complaint with my order was that the pasta sauce was not coated on all the pasta which meant some dry spots. Other than that it was good for the price. The pasta was perfectly cooked.

As for the squid ink, its a cool pasta to try purely for the unique look. Other than that, it tastes like tomato sauce so its kind of bland. Leaves your teeth black lol."}
{"text":"Interesting concept but the pasta I tried, rigatoni with amatriciana was way past al dente. My friend ordered fusili with pesto which had better flavour, but the texture of the pasta was still overdone.  

If you can - get someone else to pay for the pasta."}
{"text":"I am SO happy that Dal Moro's opened so close to my work!! I went to their Venice location and it was the best pasta there. So of course when I heard they were opening a location in Toronto I was super excited!!
Their pasta is al dente and their sauce is delicious. The portions are good and the price is right. And it's only $1 to add bacon! 
I am so excited to try all their different sauces. I am definitely going to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"The pasta is gummy and requires a lot of salt, the flavours all taste the same. Very slow service, very cramped in there. Don't bother going!"}
{"text":"When the sign went up advertising Dal Moro's coming soon, I immediately recalled my experience with them in Venice. You can't go wrong with fresh pasta! Especially served piping hot in take-out boxes!

My team and I popped in mid-week on a whim, changing our minds as we left the office in search of lunch fare. We got there just before noon and the shop was empty, leaving me worried and excited at the same time. Did the initial crowds pass judgement and deem the place unfit for lunch? Did we beat the crowd? It was a mixed situation it turned out, and to our benefit we got enough tables to comfortably sit and enjoy our meals.

I went for the rosé sauce with penne pasta, chicken, and the other usual included toppings. The wait was short for my food, and it smelled great. I was negligent and immediately burnt my tongue on the first bite (slightly) but was happy with the flavours. Unfortunately, the cream sauces (including the relevant half of my rosé sauce) were grainy and lumpy when cooling down, and the red sauces did not come in to compensate. The pasta that I tasted was fresh but not the freshest - felt like prep work was done some time ago (in the morning before lunch rush), or the pasta did not warm up properly over enough time (did not sit in the boiling water evenly, or for that extra 30 seconds). The toppings come at a steep price - $1 for bacon or chicken, $1 for mushroom or green pepper, $3 for other premium items, etc. etc. This really put the cap on what could've been a gourmet customized combination, and it was unfortunate. Nonetheless, fresh pasta does hit the spot on some days, and I didn't feel horribly ripped off for the portion, quality, and quick service I received. 

I later found out that via app Ritual, they promote a Create Your Own pasta option where the add-ins appear to be no extra charge. A colleague tried this out and verified, but I don't know if that will change over time. With this being an option, I'm sure to be back!"}
{"text":"This place has incredible food with equally sweet management and workers. Would definitely recommend (and their gnocchi is great)"}
{"text":"The reason I visited this place is to try their fresh pasta and god! Their pasta is toooooo fresh(see the picture ). I tried pesto with chicken and it really tasted yummy.My friends tried Pomodoro and MamaRosa they loved it too..Must visit place!!"}
{"text":"I got the fettuccine with pesto; for the toppings, I added chicken (extra $1.00), bacon (extra $1.00), and parmesan (free), totaling $11. The pasta was cooked perfectly! It tasted fresh and was truly delicious. Even though I didn't get the pasta choice I wanted (more on that below), the fettuccine ended up being a great alternative. However, while I usually like pesto, it was a bit TOO much for me. The pasta was smothered in so much sauce there were giant clumps of basil that were unappetizing. The taste of the pine nuts was also super strong, which may not be to everyone's liking. While I really enjoyed the pasta part, I think the sauce could be toned down a bit. 

The toppings were nice, but you definitely don't get a lot of it. There were about 4 small bacon squares, and I only noticed about 5 small chicken pieces - not worth the extra charge, IMO. 

The place is small and the entrance where you order can feel a bit cramped, even with a couple of other people, but the store has about half a dozen small tables with four chairs each if you want to eat in. When I went, they only had 4 of the 7 pasta options - no gnocchi (which is what I originally wanted to get), linguine, or penne.

Overall, would I visit again? Yes. While I wasn't completely blown away by the sauce and I think they're pretty stingy with the toppings, I do think the pasta itself is something special and I'm up for trying other sauces."}
{"text":"Build your own pasta in a box ~

Came here on a weekday night and tried the Chicken Alfredo pasta with added toppings of mushroom and mozzarella. It came in a generous portion and the pasta was very fresh. The toppings are placed at the top and you have to stir it yourself. I like how we are able to choose the doneness of the pasta to have it either al dente, regular, or soft. 

For people like me who love variety, there are 12 different pasta sauces to choose from and then get to pick your pasta such as fusilli, spaghetti, penne, and fettuccine. 

For drink options, they have recently gotten their liquor license and are serving wine and beer to pair with the pastas. It would be a nice touch if they served the wine in a glass instead of a plastic cup and provide some hooks/compartments for your belongings as there are no places to hang it on the stools."}
{"text":"Came here last week to get some late nigh eats with the feedback app. I tried the Squid Ink and my partner tried to order the Carbonara. It was supremely slow as the place was closing at 11, and we placed our order at 10. It took 30 minutes for us to get our order. At the 25 minute mark the staff came out and said they were out of Carbonara and my partner opted for the Alfredo instead. We were less than pleased.  The pasta was okay... the squid ink was quite salty but I appreciated the novelty. The Alfredo was okay but nothing to write home about.  Hopefully these guys get their act together in the near future."}
{"text":"This is the best pasta I have had at Toronto !! Tried Mama Rosa , the pasta was fresh and tasty .. 
Dessert Tiramasu was delicious , it's a must try :)"}
{"text":"I am not from Toronto, so the concept of fresh pasta to go (or I ate in) is very interesting. Pick your sauce, toppings and pasta and enjoy. The service is really friendly."}
{"text":"Besides the excellent Italian food and great ambiance, this place has some of the best service I have received in a while. From the staff, to the owner, and to the staff, I have yet to be let down. I highly recommend trying out Dal Moro's Fresh Pasta To Go if you have not been; whether for Italian food and having a great time!"}
{"text":"The business of consumer choice continues to make its way across every food item you can possibly think of in Toronto and pasta has become the next target.

This place sells freshmade pasta customized to your liking. You pick your noodle type, which base you want to have it mixed with, and then add some extra toppings to finish it off.

Oh, and they're liquor licensed so you can enjoy your meal with some beer or wine.

All of their pasta is served in a takeout container, but they have several tables available as well. You still get the takeout containers though.

I've tried two of their bases so far and it was hit or miss. The carbonara was good, but it wasn't mixed very well so by the time you're halfway through the box, you're only tasting bland pasta. The frutti de mare was much more enjoyable, with a generous portion of seafood. It was mixed better with the pasta, but red on white is harder to mess up.

If you like pasta and don't want to make your own this is a nice spot."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on good reviews. Big disappointment!

I tried Momma Rosa pasta and it had a weird flavor. If a restaurant cannot get basic pasta right, there is no hope. I'm not trying this again."}
{"text":"Looking for a meal to eat on the go but tired of the generic fast food options? Check out this new pasta-to-go restaurant located at Yonge and Wellesley!

Spearheaded by a friendly Italian chef and a kind, warm couple, this restaurant lets you customize your authentic pasta to your liking. They offer a variety of fresh in-house made pasta every day (fettuccini, gnocchi, rigatoni, etc.) and allow you to choose from a selection of sauces (even squid ink!) and toppings (they don't charge extra for parmesan!). 

My favourite pairing was the bolognese fettuccini with parmesan, fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, and garlic powder! 

The portion sizes are surprisingly larger than meets the eye and the prices are definitely not considered costly compared to other \"quick eats\"!"}
{"text":"Food: Their red sauces are a lot better than the white sauces. The pasta itself is great (when they say they'll cook it al dente that is exactly how it comes out!), but it doesn't travel/sit well, so it's best to eat your pasta right away. As other posters have said, the sauce is poured on top of the pasta in a narrow takeout box so remember to mix your pasta before digging in. If you live close by, I would recommend bringing it home and pouring the pasta into a bowl for easy mixing :)

Service: staff is incredibly friendly and open to giving you recommendations if you are having trouble deciding!

Ambience: cozy space - there are a few tables inside that sit 4 people each."}
{"text":"After trying different combinations of pastas, sauces and toppings here, I have figured out my fave. It's the spaghetti pasta, Amitriciana sauce, with seafood added and red chili flakes. SO GOOD. I would get this combination every time.

For the pasta - I have tried the fettuccine, fusilli, spaghetti and a bite of gnocchi. 

I would advise against the fettuccine because although it tastes good, it is not the best choice for the box style that the pasta is served in. (Note: the pasta is served in a takeout box, with the pasta at the bottom and sauce and toppings on top. It is loaded up to the very top, which makes it a bit difficult to mix. But mixing is important, otherwise all the flavour stays at the top and when you get halfway through your meal, you're left with just noodles and little sauce). So all of that being said - since the fettuccine is flatter and less strong, it can't really withstand the mixing required of the pasta, sauce and toppings. 

The fusilli is a bit more on the fragile end as well. Which is why I would suggest the spaghetti or gnocchi for optimal experience.

Now onto the sauces: Having tried both white and red sauces here, I definitely prefer the red tomato based sauces. I tried the pesto as well, with the fusilli, chicken, mushrooms, garlic powder and chili flakes. Something in there tasted like liquorice for me, and I couldn't figure out what it was! I didn't enjoy this combination so much.

Toppings: the SEAFOOD. All the way. It's delicious, and the amount of seafood they put in is generous. It's tiny seafood and goes perfectly with the box style. I tried the mushrooms and I wouldn't get that topping again. They're not fresh mushrooms - maybe canned? 

All in all, I think dal moro provides great value for the food they deliver. Very reasonable pricing for fresh pasta and sauces. Not to mention the amount of food you get - the box looks small but it packs a LOT.

Btw they have a liquor license so you can enjoy wines from Italy and beer with your pasta!!"}
{"text":"Quick, fresh and taste great!  Al dente!  Have been wanting to try the black squid ink sauce ever since I missed out on it while visiting Italy.  It did not disappoint!  Leaving you wanting more."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open, the pasta is freshly made and you could tell it on the first bite.
I've tried more than one of their sauces , the squid ink is a must have, can't wait to try the rest.
I have to give a special mention to the staff , they are warm and welcoming.
You've got another regular!"}
{"text":"When I was in Venice about 4 years ago, I was told to check out the restaurant that serves pasta in a box. Unfortunately, it was a Sunday and the restaurant was closed. Luckily for me, they opened up a location in Toronto and I picked up some pasta to go through Feedback. I ordered the Frutti de Mare pasta. I find the pasta's texture a bit mushy, but you can taste how fresh the pasta is. The sauce was just average. 

I like to think of Dal Moro as more of a \"fast-food\" pasta kinda place, and while it was not the best pasta I've ever had, it might be good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Just grabbed a food here at Dal Moro's Fresh Pasta To Go and it was incredible! The service was spectacular even if the restaurant was very busy. The food was incredible. Pasta homemade daily and the dessert was a delight. Fresh ingredients and timeless recipes make this a top choice for best Italian restaurant in town. Be back here when I get a chance to visit Toronto."}
{"text":"i was excited to try this place but to be honest it kind of sucked. The white sauce was bland, it was like there was no seasoning at all... also, I think people don't realize that you are paying $10 for like half a container of pasta. I thought the portions would be bigger...it's not enough to fill you up unless you're a kid, or want to eat again in the next 2 hours."}
{"text":"I had a bolognese and a carbonara. It tasted okay, but the pastas were way overcooked compared to Italy, or even standard Italian restaurants in Toronto. Not to mention it being stuffed in a box makes it a congealed mess, even when you eat it right as it's being given to you. Service was adequate and fast, price is reasonable, but all-in-all the food makes it a disappointing experience for a place that specializes in Italian pasta."}
{"text":"This was reaaaaally awful. Like truly bad pasta. I got the spaghetti pomodoro, and they put one tiny basil leaf on it for the whole dish, and the sauce tasted like it came out of a can - definitely not authentic Italian pasta sauce. It honestly tasted like a can of zoodles or alphaghetti. I could have made better pasta from scratch. Would not recommend at all, and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Pasta in a box! Not bad!

I'd never heard of this place before but my friend told me that she had it in Italy and it was amazing, so we decided to come here for lunch. The food is high quality, made fresh and the pasta is cooked perfectly.

You get to choose your type of pasta, sauce, and toppings, and they make it for you right away. Toppings are $1 extra for each except chili flakes and garlic powder - which are free.
 
I had the fettucine pomodoro with chicken and bacon, and my friend had the rigatoni pomodoro with bacon - both were really good. 

The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found it a little bit expensive for the portion sizes - I probably could've eaten two boxes. But maybe I just eat a lot."}
{"text":"Build your own pasta in a box! Pick your pasta, pick your sauce, pick your toppings, and voila!

They only had 3 of the 7 pasta options when I went (shortly after opening for the day), but they do make their pasta fresh so I guess they weren't quite ready. There are 12 sauce options to choose from (ranging from $8-12) and you can get additional toppings (free or $1 surcharge). 

The box they serve their pasta in does look small, but it's actually quite filling!"}
{"text":"Excited to see that this place had opened and came to give it a try. Ordered rigatoni with al formaggi sauce as well as fusilli with their mix of white and tomato sauce. The latter came with barely any sauce (the pasta was very lightly coated), but the staff was nice enough to add more for us and let us know that we can ask for extra sauce when placing our order. The al formaggi sauce was a lot more flavourful, though the cheese flavour was a little overpowering (understandably because it's made with 4 different cheeses). I also asked for chili flakes, which may have made the entire thing a tad too spicy - will probably ask for less next time. The pasta was perfectly al dente, very chewy and tasted extremely fresh. The portion sizes in my opinion are filling enough for lunch, though possibly not for dinner. The service here is also very friendly and pleasant. 

Although this first experience was a little lacklustre and I may have come in with too high expectations, I do look forward to coming here again and trying some different combinations of pasta and sauce. Possibly for the gnocchi, which is available on weekends!"}
{"text":"It's the second time I came to this pasta place and their fresh pasta is amazingly good. My friends and I were invited for the pre-opening tasting during our first visit and we ordered two dishes each. I had the Chicken Bolognese with Linguine and the Pesto Rigatoni. I love the Pesto's refreshing taste. The owner Gabriele was really a passionate guy. He explained the entire process of creating his traditional Italian pasta and he personally serviced us like we were in a high end restaurant. He didn't even allow me to get the parmesan cheese on my own, insisting that he would do (probably because I keep hugging it).

For my second visit, I took the Fruitti di Mare with a soft Fettuccine and the Chicken Carbonara with Fusilli. I wasn't too impressed with the Carbonara, but the Fruitti di Mare was absolutely perfect tasting. I purposely requested a softer pasta since the regular pasta was too chewy for my taste. They recently got the liquid license, so I ask for a white wine to match it. For some reason, I didn't feel the wine was complementing the pasta. As I ate my pasta, I felt like there was still something missing, like a side dish. It would be nice if they offered garlic bread, salad or soup, and make it a combo with a pop. Maybe something to consider."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to this place as he had tried it a few times. Staff were really polite and very helpful when it came to explaining their menu. The place is quite small with a few tables on the side. Although there were four seats per table, it was a bit tight for my liking.

As for the menu, they have different fresh pasta with a variety of sauces and toppings. I tried the Nero di seppia with fusilli which is seafood pasta in squid ink sauce. It was something I wanted to try but the pasta in Amitriciana sauce was definitely my favorite. They even have a variety of wines to pair with the pasta cooked Venice style. 

Upon looking at the wall, it appears it is a franchise brought over from Venice. Barcelona is the other city that serves up pasta from this franchise. There were some modifications to the original way of cooking to suit the Toronto market.

Now comes some suggestions. The menu selection was somewhat daunting with so many choices.  It would be nice to have a list of chef recommended pasta or even favorites that other patrons frequently order. Some additional sides like salad and soup would compliment the pasta nicely.

Although it was nice for the staff to bring the food to our table, it would be a nice touch to serve is in an actual bowl rather than a takeout container. The pasta could be tossed a little bit more so the sauce and ingredients would mix together better throughout the dish. 

Overall, it was a good experience and with a great story from staff on its origins. I will be back when I pass by the area."}
{"text":"Located on Yonge/Wellesley area, I had the opportunity to come here and try their delicious fresh pasta. They had an exclusive tasting event during the soft opening and my foodie friends and I came to give it a try. Apparently the chef is from Italy and they have a franchise already established there with this interesting concept. Chef Gabriele Dal Moro was super nice and giving us an overview of his restaurant, his cooking background and the menu items. You get to choose from 5 different pastas and 8 difference sauces along with a variety of meat and vegetarian toppings to go along with it. First I ordered the fettucine pasta with the Bolognese sauce with chicken and mushrooms. They give you a loaded takeout box of fresh pasta and it was quick for them to make. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of how they prepare and cook fresh pasta. The gnocchi with pesto sauce with chicken, mushrooms, and mozzarella. I have to say, I really really enjoyed this dish. It was simply delicious with a good amount of flavour and they give you a good amount of pasta with just the right amount of sauce and toppings. The base price for each pasta dish is about $8-$10 with your choice of sauces. It is extra for different toppings. They do have some seating in the restaurant but it is primarily a takeout restaurant. Overall, a very nice pasta restaurant. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and would be a happy customer coming back to try some of their other dishes especially the gnocchi!!"}
{"text":"Tried  the Fettuccine pesto with chicken and chilli flakes. Didn't know it would taste this food, Straight up 5 stars for the amazing chef and the great ambience:)"}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing special. I'm not a great cook and feel like i can was easily pull off this stuff at home. Ordered 4 types and the daily special with eggplants was the best. The tiramisu was alright too. Tasted homemade.
The service was great though!!"}
{"text":"Great concept and food was very good.
We tried the gnocchi with pomodoro and fusilli with chicken alfredo. We preferred the pomodoro sauce."}
{"text":"Not really worth the hype or the wait. Wasn't blown away by my pasta, not much flavor."}
{"text":"While I enjoyed the service and the idea of what it was, the squid ink pasta was just alright. If I closed my eyes it would've just tasted like a variation of a tomato sauce."}
{"text":"They are new to Toronto scene and I have been here twice already !! Building your own pasta is a fun process and gives you the chance to have the pasta your very own way. You pick your pasta, your sauce, toppings even the way you want your pasta cooked, can be al-dente, regular or soft. Pasta types are fusilli, spaghetti, fettucine, linguine, gnocchi or rigatoni. For sauce they have vegan, vegetarian, meat, fish options. 

The first time I went there they didn't have the liquor license but they have it now, they got it very recently. It was a nice treat to have a glass of wine with my fresh pasta, I have tried both red and white wine. They were delicious, since Dal Moro is originated from Venice it was nice touch to have the wines from Venice. 

In my first visit I have tried \"squid ink\" for the first time in my life, it was quite yummy.

I have ordered 2 different meals, had them cooked \"regular\". First one was linguine with \"Frutti Di Mare\" sauce (tomato sauce, clams, shrimps, mussels, cuttle fish). I have doubled up the sea food content by selecting \"seafood\" as topping, also added mushrooms, parmesan, garlic powder and red chili flakes, it was super yummy !!! I love seafood and there was quite a lot of seafood in my fresh pasta, I ate the hold package with a big smile drinking my white wine. The packaging doesn't look large but it is quite filling with size and amazing taste.

For second pasta I have selected \"Amatriciana\" sauce (tomato sauce, bacon, onions, black pepper) which the staff told me that it was customers favorite. I had chicken as topping and parmesan with fusilli as pasta type. The taste of bacon made a significant yummy taste with pasta, I could tell why it was customers favorite, but I still choose the \"Frutti Di Mare\" because I love seafood.

I got so full with pasta that I didn't try their tiramisu, looking forward to try it next time.

The packaging is designed for take out although there is a small cozy area and some tables and chairs you can sit and enjoy as well. Washrooms and sitting area, tables are very maintained.

Staff and manager are very friendly and they make sure you get the perfect pasta that you are craving for. This pasta is yummy comfort food and has the feeling of Venice in a container. I will definitely go there again in my pasta cravings."}
{"text":"Unique idea but wouldn't come back.

I first tried Dal Moro in Venice, Italy and the toronto location taste the same. Not my cup of tea and a hard pass.  Service was good, nice play but the food fell short.

The pasta tasted like hot but fresh michelina's (no offense) and what's up with the canned mushrooms... 

We had the..
-Carbonara added bacon and parm... (just okay)
-Bolognese added bacon and mushrooms...(didn't like the mushrooms and sauce didnt taste like real tomatoes, gooey & weird)
-Mammas sauce with bacon ( only one that was good!)
- frutti de mare (seafood tasted fishy)

Edible but not worth another visit. 
P.S it was not cheap."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive- the staff were super friendly and helpful! The portion size was also a good value. Now the not so good part... the food... I ordered the amatriciana with fettuccine pasta and added chicken, garlic, parm, and chilli flakes. I have to say I was quite disappointed after reading such great reviews. I ordered the pasta al dente and it was super mushy. It also tasted very similar to the michelena's frozen pasta entrees that you heat up in the microwave. The chicken also looked like it was boiled in oil and water rather than grilled or sautéed. Too bad that it was such a bad experience, I was hopeful that I would have a new lunch spot in the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this place after hearing about how good they are and how this place is just like the Dal Moro's in Italy! 

There's a couple of seating on the side but this place isn't meant to come in large groups. The food comes in small take out boxes which is pretty cute. 

I order the Mama Rosa which is a classic tomato and cream sauce and my friend got the pesto. You get to choose the type of pasta (I got gnocchi and my friend got linguine), there's additional charges if you want to add protein, and free choices of toppings such as parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and chili flakes. 

The pasta is made to order and came out piping hot. It smelled so good!!! Both orders tasted just as good, however we found that the pesto with linguine was a lot lighter than the mama rosa with gnocchi. That was just very very filling. 

Price was a tad pricy for the portion of it, but I'll be back whenever I'm craving some good ol' Italian pasta."}
{"text":"I've been here everyday ever since this restaurant has opened. The pasta is so fresh and the sauces that they use are delicious!!! I've become addicted!!! Their tiramisu is really good, a must try if stopping by to get pasta. The portion is the perfect size!! Love love love, will definitely become a regular here."}
{"text":"I live a fast paced life and find myself eating a lot of takeout.  This is a nice change to the usual burgers and subs that most people serve.  

It's definitely not the best pasta ever, but not bad for something quick.  I had the rose sauce with the rotini pasta.  I just added parm as none of the toppings were tickling my fancy.  I wish they had more topping options.  The pasta was overcooked, but was okay.  The sauce was good but bland.  

Service was very friendly and quick.  You can eat there, but there's only a handful or so of seats.  The to-go containers are cute, and they even ask you if you're going to eat it now or later as they have appropriate containers for each."}
{"text":"Came here a week ago during their soft opening. Owner came to our table. Very friendly guy. He said he came straight from Italy to open first store in North America. Unlike most other Italian restaurant the make fresh pasta from scratch which is why it tastes better. He showed us the different types of pasta they make and took our orders. I had the Gnocchi with Alfredo sauce chicken, and also tried their spaghetti with squid ink sauce as I never had it before. The like the squid ink more. It did not have a strong flavor but it was good. They were quite generous with the portions as well. Only recommendation is if they had the chicken grilled, it would taste better.

The place is small. Probably seat 16 people. However it is not a traditional Italian restaurant where you would come to dine in. More of a fast food place where you can take your pasta to go."}
{"text":"Came here during their soft opening and was greeted with a warm welcome by the owner.  He told us about his passion for making fresh high quality pasta which he perfected in Italy and his dreams to share it to people all around the world.  We got to see fresh pasta being made on site and were giving a few uncooked samples to touch and taste.  After that we were asked to pick a sauce, pasta type and toppings to try.  I decided to go with a tomato seafood sauce on top of gnocchi pasta with mushrooms and bacon.  The gnocchi was light and tender and went well with the seafood medley.   
I also got the rigatoni with black squid ink sauce with bacon and chicken.  I never had black squid ink sauce before and would recommend everyone to give it a try.  The rigatoni texture was perfect al dente and held the sauce well.  I enjoyed both pasta boxes with the rigatoni being the clear winner.  
Some minor constructive criticism include: redo on the pasta boxes to make it easier to mix all the ingredients together, sauces can get too watery (I prefer thicker pasta sauces), and tweaks to the toppings such as making the bacon crispier or roasting the chicken.  
Overall it was a good dining experience and will be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Best pasta in Toronto. Took me back to my days in Italy. Great price, perfect amount and incredibly flavourful. I'm in love."}
{"text":"I'd heard some good buzz about this new pasta place in the neighbourhood but, unfortunately, I probably won't go back.  

I ordered a Mamma Rosa sauce with fusilli and added on chicken, mushrooms and the free toppings (chili flakes, parmesan and garlic powder).  The sauce was minimal in both quantity and taste and the toppings were all just dumped onto the top of the container with no room to mix them through.  Who wants a mouthful of chili flakes or garlic powder to start your meal?  

The pasta itself was fine but overall the dish was underwhelming for the price.  I think I'll stick with other pasta places in the area."}
{"text":"Just when you thought the quality of takeaway food places is going down the shambles in Toronto, Dal Maro's comes out as a saviour. Right from the word go, you are sure of the fact that your decision of enjoying Italian delicacies is not going to be regretted upon. Their delightful ambience, wooden decor setup which exudes positive vibes and vibrant open kitchen, prominently compliments the amazing variety of food that they serve in these compact storage boxes. I ordered myself a \"Pomodoro\", and I was not dissapointed one bit. The first bite itself introduced me to lip smacking flavors of fresh tomato sauce with a hint of basil, while the quality of pasta was top notch. For a person who's not much into Italian cuisine, their pasta options definitely made me crave for more. I would definitely recommend this place to every single pasta and non-pasta lover and trust me, you'll come out rubbing your tummy with a huge smile on your face. Two thumbs up :) :)"}
{"text":"This new to-go fresh made pasta was a delight. 

It's new, the owners were very friendly and I didn't mind when they came to our table to get some feedback.

I got the Nero de seppia (black squid ink) with fresh spaghetti with chicken and parm. I was so excited because I had no idea what to expect. 

So, if you've never tried black squid ink, it's a little more on the tomato sauce side but the texture tasty creamy -if that makes any sense lol. 

I know it's a \"to-go\" place and so the whole premise is \"to-go\" cups,  but it was hard for my friends and I to mix it evenly because when I got closer to the bottom, there's all this spaghttti clumped together. If they had the box less narrow and a bit wider, that might help with the mixing.

Overall here's what I think:

Taste - amazing, especially the pasta. Fresh and al denté!

Price - reasonable (the portion size is more than enough)

Service - super friendly

Atmosphere - it's a to-go place, but they have row of tables for 4 seaters, but honestly 3 to a table is way too much. Also to note, I wouldn't get this delivered cuz it'll get cold and lose the whole integrity of the dish.

This was a fun experience and I'd go again just for taste of that fresh pasta"}
{"text":"I walked by this restaurant around 8 pm. At the time of this writing, the restaurant was having a \"soft opening\". I was greeted promptly by both staff members. They were very friendly and were able to explain all the options on the menu. 

I'll begin my review with the premise of the restaurant. This is the third restaurant of its kind but the first in North America. The kind of food is freshly made pasta and sauces as well as toppings. You choose the kind of pasta, the sauces, and any toppings (which are an extra charge). 

The quality of the pasta was very good. I was told that it was made daily as well as the sauce. The pasta was cooked properly and there was a good portion size. The sauce was well made and there was enough sauce but not enough to drown the pasta. Along with the pasta, you are also offered fresh cheese on top of the pasta.( I will update the review once I have had more than two versions of the sauces)

The restaurant itself was small and had seating for about 20 people. It was mainly designed for take-out. You could clearly see the entire process of how the people made the food. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Dal Moro's is SO delicious! You can pick your pasta sauce, pasta shape, and toppings. They rotate the pasta shapes so you don't always get what you want, but personally I love the spaghetti one which they always have. 

There's white sauce base, red sauce base, and some variations like the squid ink or pesto. The red sauces are my favorite, I adore the amatriciana and bolognese! They also have free toppings, which include parmesan, chili flakes and garlic powder. If you want you can add the more expensive ones like bacon. 

I docked off a star only because the service is really slow. It's a popular place so you might have to wait up to 20 minutes for your pasta. If you come at an off hour it's probably around 10-15 minutes. Other than that I love this takeout restaurant and I will come back!

Tip: they ask if you want a takeout container, or a white container. Just get the white container because the sauces will mix better and the pasta will soften."}
{"text":"First time I've had fresh pasta this good. The service is impeccable and you can really tell the owner puts his heart and soul into the food. Definitely looking forward to trying more on the menu."}
{"text":"Skip the line and order from Ritual!

Fresh made to order pasta on the go! I'd say try this place if you're looking for fast and fresh pasta if you're in a hurry. I wouldn't consider the price point low but it's definitely not high. For what it's worth, the place is way too cramped to eat in, even if there are seating, it's not comfortable. The takeout containers were not though out properly as the pasta at the bottom curdles together into a ball after finishing the pasta at the top. Also they don't toss your toppings together with the sauce, it's laid on top so you have to dig through & mix it yourself. The mushroom is canned - not fresh mushroom. 
The pasta we got were overdone as well, not al dente. 
Would not come back."}
{"text":"The ambience was relaxed and neat. Service was fast and good. I had Carbonara, and it was very good. (White Cream, Egg, Parmesan, Black Pepper, Bacon or Chicken). 

The Tiramisù, which we had for the end of the meal was very good, too. Will surely be back again!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We eat here atleast 2 times in a Week.

Their Tiramisu is Fantastic and Only $5.00. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Love the tomato sauce. A lot of flavors but not too sweet or salty.
Eating gnocchi for the first time, which was enjoyable. Like the texture of potatoes with a bit more chewiness"}
{"text":"I was really excited at the concept of this place an got half my office to order it the first time I went there.

The place was packed which is always a good sign.

There were positives and negatives for sure

Pros

Tomato based sauces seemed to be the best pick out of anything served
Wallet friendly
Service was relatively quick

Cons

Pasta wasn't well mixed and kind of congealed at a certain point
Cream sauces didn't really hit the mark for me. Stick to the tomato sauces
IT WAS PACKED

Its worth another look for sure. But these were the first thoughts I had on my experience."}
{"text":"Could have found better pasta in the trash can. Had the squid ink and sea food pastas with delivery. The squid ink looked like my morning dump, and quite frankly, smelt like it too. The sea food pasta tasted tangy. Just TRY to imagine the taste of TANGY SEAFOOD... Evidently, the pasta was not fresh. 

And you'd think they can at least uphold part of the restaurant's name by having it in a box, like advertised. Instead, it came in a plastic tray. Literally their entire restaurant name is a lie. I bet Dal Moro is also a straight up lie. 

TLDR, this was a huge disappointment. I am angered that 
I even have to give this place ONE star."}
{"text":"Tried the Nero Di Seppia and Frutti Di Mare pastas at Dal Moro's and they taste fantastic. 

The Frutti Di Mare pasta absorbed all the flavour from the seafood and every bite was filled with satisfaction. The handmade pasta is not only soft but it was cooked perfectly. 

The Nero Di Seppia pasta is very similar to black rice paella but with even stronger flavour! The taste is one of a kind and not a word can be used to describe the unique flavour. 

For those who love authentic Spanish/Italian food, you will fall In love with it."}
{"text":"Ordered the Gnocci with pesto and Fettuccine with Bolognese. We came here all the way from the US to try this pasta and it was fresh and great tasting!"}
{"text":"Had such a great experience here, the staff were very patient and helpful in explaining the menu. The food was very hot, very fresh and a large portion size for a reasonable price. Despite being a \"to go\" or \"takeaway\" resteraunt, the staff was very friendly and even approached our table while we were eating to ask how everything was tasting and offered us more of the free toppings. Very happy with my experience here and am excited to come back"}
{"text":"Just popped in walking down the street on Yonge. It's kind of like Chinese food takeout but with pasta, which I was interesting. 

You pick the sauce you want and any toppings. Ready really quickly, and was great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I had such high expectations about this place given the amazing reviews I read on yelp. Maybe the experience would have been different if I ate at the restaurant rather than having it delivered through Foodora. 

The portions are generous is about the only good thing I can say... the entire experience lacked any 'wow'. I felt like I could have gone to Longos and gotten some pasta sauce and pasta and made the same dish myself. I was quite disappointed, but maybe I am expecting too much for a $10 pasta dish."}
{"text":"Erm I was excited to try this place as it was from Venice. But I was disappointed. Got the seafood pasta with rigatoni. They asked if I wanted Parmesan which I said yes, but didn't expect it to be all on top of the pasta. The seafood pasta is okay, the sauce is a bit salty (made even more salty with the Parmesan). Also waited a long time to order and get the food. There was no seating at lunch time and it was so crowded. And they told me I had to eat my food within 10 minutes if I wanted it to go in the to go box (so it won't taste good if I did not eat in within 10 minutes)??"}
{"text":"So happy that Dal Moro's opened up in Toronto! Have been to the location in Venice and this brings back memories. Equally delicious with a generous amount of space, relative to the original one. Props to the staff who were efficient and courteous during my visit! Will definitely be back soon - much better than the Tosto's nearby :)"}
{"text":"Very good food and very friendly staff but a little expensive and it would be nice if they gave you a little bit bigger containers of pasta as it isn't very much food for a meal."}
{"text":"So they actually have a Dal Moro's in Italy...it's originally from there I believe? Anywho, heard about this place online and had to check it out. 

Came on a weekday evening and it was pretty packed. Nonetheless, the friendly server took our order swiftly. 

The restaurant is quite simple in appearance, yet aesthetically pleasing. It is a takeout place but they have some barstool tables fit for 2-3 people. 

The wait to get the food wasn't too long, and it arrived piping hot in the cute little takeout containers. I found the portion size to be quite a good size, though some may find it small. 

I ordered the penne in a pesto sauce and it was delicious. So light and refreshing. My friend got the fettuccine Alfredo which I tried as well and it was delectable. So creamy and delicious! Probably high in calories too but definitely worth it. 

You can definitely tell the care out into the preparation of this pasta. It was fresh and tasty. I'll definitely be back, hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Finally! An affordable fresh pasta place that opens till 11pm and is automatically a take out place. It's not amazingly good but it's pretty decent for fresh pasta take out. You can dine in but they serve them in take out boxes so it's even better if you can't finish it and want to go home. Great place for a simple pasta place - lots of sauce and the pasta was fresh. Parmesan is also free here so yay!"}
{"text":"Who can really go wrong with pasta? I've been looking forward to going to this place for a while and it honestly did not disappoint. I had the chicken alfredo and the pomodorro. Both were amazing! Fresh, tons of sauce, and tons of flavor in both. I also enjoyed that I could get a Heinekken for 4$ - unheard of in Toronto. The tiramisu was so good too - definitely going back for that. The staff is really friendly. Make sure to ask to try sauces if you're confused. Theres some seating inside and it's a cute spot for lunch or dinner. By the time we got to the bottom of the carton the pasta had gotten stuck together - so be careful if you're taking it to go."}
{"text":"YUMMY....!!!!!
After so long....My craving for pasta has been satisfied.Everything here is freshly made with wide range of toppings to choose from. I have tried the fusilli with pesto and chicken.. its delicious.Its a must try place for all the pasta lovers out there"}
{"text":"Love love love! My first time visiting Dal Moro's Fresh Pasta To Go was in Venice. It was hard to find in the cobble stone maze. There was a long lineup outside of the tiny takeout location. The pasta was rich and delicious! 

My friend and I visited Dal Moro for a quick lunch time hangout! Her boyfriend is Italian, so naturally, she is fortunate enough to enjoy home-cooked meals prepared by his Italian mother. Overtime, she has developed a barometer to evaluate Italian food. 

We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals! She opted for the Ai Formaggi with Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Parmesan, Pecorino ($10) and loved the texture of the fresh made pasta. It received a good rating on her sophisticated barometer! I had the pesto with Basil, Nuts, Garlic, Extra Virgin Oil, Parmesan ($9). The pesto was fresh with a pronounced garlic and nutty flavour! Pasta was al dente! 

Dal Moro's Fresh Pasta To Go is a GO for us! If an Italian by association person say it is good, who am I to question its quality!"}
{"text":"Dal Moro's is absolutely genius! I mean, it's Pasta to go! I love coming here after class when I feel like treating myself to a nice meal without breaking the bank. They've got a sizeable variety of pastas and sauces to choose from. My personal favourite is the Frutti de Mare, a seafood pasta. They're quick, cheap, and really delicious. One thing I really like is the way they pack your pasta if you don't intend to eat it right away; separating the sauce from the pasta to ensure you're getting the best pasta experience. They could definitely benefit from some more seating."}
{"text":"I felt bad after my review may have been a bit harsh, And i really love pasta so i had to try it again. Wow. Seriously Wow. I'm so glad i went back. I tried the Bolognese and it was fantastic. Rich hearty sauce and the noodles were so perfect. I also had the Quatro Formaggi and the tiramisu and they were also great.... But the Bolognese....You have to try the Bolognese when you go if your unsure of what to try. When i was leaving there was a lineup to the door so the buzz has caught on. Seriously delicious food at a decent price point in a timely manner. Congrats to the Dal Moros team you guys are going to be very busy this summer!"}
{"text":"Edit: Based on feedback, no pasta costs more than $14, and they have 7 meat sauce options. Also, Parmesan is free. 

----- 
This is an expensive take out place. It has such a great idea not nothing was extraordinary. A pasta could easily cost $20. The basic options are $10 and every ingredient is an extra $1. They have mozzarella, Parmesan or mushrooms for an extra $1. 

You have to be careful when choosing a sauce, most of them are vegetarian. We had the chicken Alfredo and the squid sauce spaghetti. The chicken Alfredo was lacking in flavour and the chicken was pink. It didn't bring anything to the table. The squid spaghetti was a lot better! Though, if you're wearing a white shirt, you've been warned! It was vegetarian which was a bit of a turn off if I'm paying $10 for pasta, I want some meat on it! 

On the bright side, the pasta is made fresh and there are a lot of variety!"}
{"text":"Worst squid ink pasta (Nero di seppia) I have ever had. Had high expectation to it. Small portions, bad taste, doesn't worth $14 (I added seafood and mushroom). Also tried the carbonara, really bad too."}
{"text":"How can I give this place a 3.5 star?!

Pasta was quite ok - fresh and al dente, but definitely does not compare to what you get in Venice (or Italy in general). Can't really quite describe what's missing - perhaps a lack of flavour or too much sauce... I tried the pesto and there wasn't enough of a kick in the flavour even though my pasta was so coated in it.

What I can say though is that I've finally found the tiramisu I have been searching for all my life in Toronto. After having the best tiramisu of my life at ZaZa in Florence, I've disappointedly tried so many in Toronto that did not live up to expectations. Tiramisus here are either not flavourful, too creamy and not a strong enough espresso to complement, or contains 80% lady finger not soaked long enough. I was so happy when they offered my friend a free tiramisu because they forgot her order - I tried a spoonful and just wanted to devour the entire store's worth of tiramisu. Perfect mascarpone to lady finger ratio, lady finger was soaked in great espresso, and the flavour really shone through. 

Don't come here for the pasta - the real star is the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Pretty good \"fast food\" pasta! 
I had the spagetti squid ink with seafood and the bolognese rigatoni. 
Yum!
So much that I wish the size was larger!! I wish the containers were larger for the same price. 
Good for on the go though, I like the concept of their containers. 
Squid ink was interesting, I only ever had the ink pasta not ink sauce. A bit of a tartness to it. But teeth staining for sure. 
MY fav was the rigatoni bolognese!
Chewy al dente! You get the real flavor and texture of their pasta when you choose this kind of pasta. I did not notice it much with the spagetti noodles. And the sauce, simple and just slide down straight into my belly comforting kinda taste. 
I would go back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and pasta was pretty good. The layout is tiny and doesn't have space to wait for takeout."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up to 4. 

Tried their squid ink \"Nero di Seppia\" fusilli with added seafood and a second serving of \"Frutti di Mare\" rigatoni with chicken and mushroom added in.  Overall consistent creamy sauce served with ample amount of pasta.  Add some red chilli flakes for the kick in taste.  

Based on food offering vs pricing, I think it's worth the visit for lower priced point pasta (see pic attached).  At higher priced point pasta, it is better to visit a sit down restaurant for value and aesthetic plating.  

Wine served in plastic cups....really?! Please get rid of it, it cheapens the dining experience.  Serve it in wine glass please~

Disclosure: review was based on complimentary food and drinks/wine pairing.  Readers can decide for themselves the objectivity of this review."}
{"text":"I have to say that the people are amazing, even though it gets busy people are polite and care about how you feel. 
 
In addition, the pasta is fresh and delicious, the fettuccine with pomodoro is fantastic, very flavorful and light. 

My wife tried the linguine with pesto and parmesan she just loved it, the taste and the final touch with real pinoli got her talking about it all day. 

It's a 5 stars place for sure.."}
{"text":"Thus place is a pleasant surprise. Was here Monday around 5pm. There was a very small line. I ordered a bolognese with the thick pasta. Chili flakes, Parmesan, and garlic powder are free add-ons for all pasta. It came in a take out container and was delicious! Probably will come back to try other types in the future."}
{"text":"Unpretentious fresh aromatic and savory pasta.
Tried twice and all 4 pastas were great.
Alfredo, Promodoro, Nero Di Seppia(squid ink) and Carbonara. As was the tiramisu.

My fav  is the the Nero one.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed and not worth the price. The pasta itself was good however the meal is assembled like a salad, the sauce drizzled on top of the pasta with the ingredients as a topping. This is not a pasta dish. Tips : get a pan, and get fresh ingredients. Ie the mushrooms and olives are stored in water and dumped cold on top of the sauce. 
It was also a slow and confused service, two orders out of six were wrong."}
