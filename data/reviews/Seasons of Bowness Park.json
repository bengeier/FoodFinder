{"text":"Would give 5 stars for location, but the service and good quality take it way down. Slow to acknowledge us on walk in, despite being more than half empty. Once seated, it took forever to get water and service. We ordered drinks and dinner right away, and had to ask for status on both repeatedly. Seems the kitchen was short staffed. We were told a few things weren't available as we tried to order. Would have been nice too or before poring over the menu. Food eventually came, and wasn't anything to write home about. No manager around or anyone who seemed interested to pop in and see how things were. Server seemed overworked and disinterested. Amazing view, and the city has done a great job on restoration. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"I dislike writing a bad review and generally only review great experiences. However, I feel I need to relate the extremely poor experience I had at this restaurant. I was very much looking forward to finally trying this restaurant as it is located in a park that holds so many of my happy childhood memories. On a whim since it was such a hot and sunny day my husband and I decided it would be a great night to have dinner on a patio and I was able to make a quick reservation via OpenTable.  If you do not wish to read the whole review the reasons I encourage you to give this place a miss is due to very poor service, cold and mediocre food, and an unwillingness by staff to make any effort to remedy this.  
We did wait a fair amount of time once seated for a server to come and take our drink orders. We ordered a bottle of wine and after a fairly long wait the server returned to tell us they were out of our selection. This is not a big deal however admittedly I was disappointed as I was really excited to have this wine. It took a while for us to decide on something else  mainly because we were familiar with the other selections on the menu. I think our server took my disappointment and our difficulty in making another selection as us being \"snobbish\" but this is speculation on my part. Once our drinks were served we waited another long time before our dinner order was taken.  Luckily we were in no rush and it was a nice evening.  Our appetizer arrived. It was a pork belly lettuce wrap. The lettuce portion was wilted and did not look appetizing.  My husband did not eat the lettuce. Otherwise it was okay.   The time between when our appetizer was served and our main course was extraordinarily long. We did not see our server during this time and again because we were in no hurry did not mention anything. Just as we were contemplating saying something our meals arrived. I ordered the Lake Brome Duck and my husband the Salmon Filet. Both dishes looked like they had sat under the heat lamp waiting to be picked up for sometime. However, even the heat lamp couldn't keep my food hot.  It was luke warm at best.  I was so hungry at this point. My husbands dish was not much warmer. The salmon was very dry and over cooked and the mushroom risotto which looked reheated rather than freshly made was an odd choice to accompany the salmon. The duck confit tortellini that I had looked forward to was chewy, cold, and without flavour. We started eating slowly thinking the server would check up on us as is customary. But having waited so long and being so hungry we finished our plates disappointed with every bite. When our server finally returned to take our plates and asked us how it was my husband mentioned the food was cold upon arrival. Our server said to take it up with the chef and walked away. It was rather odd. Then sometime later he returned and placed the bill on our table without asking us if we would care for anything else such as dessert. It was utterly strange and we felt dismissed. When our server returned with a card machine and asked if we were ready my husband, baffled gave a little laugh and said he guessed he didn't want dessert.  The server said he asked us and I told him he was mistaken. Through the whole experience we felt the server was very condescending towards us. This is the first time we refused to tip at a restaurant.  The type of food and the prices presented on the menu would signify caliber of service and quality. I honestly don't think I've had such a bad experience with both in such a long time. There are many great restaurants in Calgary that serve delicious food and have immaculate service for the same price range as this so don't waste your hard earned dollars here."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The view is wonderful. Service is great and no one rushes you out. This place is kid-friendly and the food is good quality. My chicken pot pie was much better than my own version, and I could tell the vegetables were local. If you care about quality and like eating in a tranquil, relaxing venue with a great view, check this place out."}
{"text":"After a nice walk in Bowness Park, located in NW Calgary and on the Bow River, we stopped for a glass of wine and a light snack. Although we had been here previously we completely forgot about the patio and chose a spot on the deck overlooking the lagoon. 

The immediate vibe was amazing sitting at a nice high top table for two and found it to be very relaxing. 

Ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and a couple of light appetizers. Food was excellent and service was attentive.

Great place to add to your summer adventures."}
{"text":"Beautiful views but service is *very* slow (only go if you literally have HOURS to eat/ enjoy a meal and the great views of Bowness Park). Took 20 minutes for someone to greet us and take our initial order for drinks once we sat down. Seems understaffed and can't handle lunch/dinner rush. Menu quite limited and expensive. Patio in the summer is great but that's pretty much it. Overall very disappointing as I had been looking forward to going here for a while. We were there for over two and a half hours for a simple lunch before our stroll in the park. Never again."}
{"text":"We reserved a large table for a brunch and were the only customers at that time. Suffice it to say we received great service and great food. The food was tasty and well plated. No complaints; we had a lovely time catching up with our party and the staff were attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"What a great view from this beautiful restaurant!  I came here for brunch with a friend on a Saturday morning and it wasn't very busy at all. This surprised me as the service, food and view were excellent! And finding a good brunch place that isn't busy in this city is almost an anomaly. Our server did express that orders can take longer as everything is made from scratch. That's right folks! - Casual fine dining  made in house, fresh and from scratch.  As it wasn't super busy, we didn't find the wait very long at all.

We ordered some french press coffee that hit the spot and my friend had the Eggs Benedict with salmon and I had the Croque Madame. My friend said that the Eggs Benedict was absolutely delicious. The brown butter hollandaise sauce was to die for. This sauce is the real deal folks! Not made from a packet. 

The Croque Madame was huge! and the chevre noir mornay sauce that covered the egg and cured ham on the french toast was absolutely delectable! The ham was shaved thinly and the over easy egg was perfect. The roasted potatoes were equally yummy. I still salivate thinking about it...

The view was so lovely looking out on the Bow River - definitely added to the tranquil ambiance of the restaurant. Guys and gals - this would be a very romantic dinner date and you can go for a walk in the park after.

I would definitely come back here again for brunch or dinner for that matter. Overall a big thumbs up. Thanks for the wonderful experience!"}
