{"text":"The Chicago style Dog with the Pretzel bun is amazing! Great staff and is a good location! It would be perfect for a work party or birthday party as the have a good truck!"}
{"text":"First time here.  We ordered the Mac n dog kids meal and the Polish dog with onion rings.  Food flavor was good.  The temperature of the food needed to be warmer.  Onion rings temp was good, maybe the rest of the food was sitting till onion rings were done?  Like I said first time going, new shop, I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"This place was bbooommbbb. Best hot dog I've had in Arizona hands down. If you go here, get the gringo dog."}
{"text":"We visit Mugsy Dogs more often than I'd like to admit.  Their food is always fresh and customer service is excellent.  We even had an occasion where we ordered online and they didn't think our food was warm enough so they remade our order.  The restaurant is always clean.  The one thing is that I wish they would toast their hamburger buns a bit so the condiments would be a little less messy.  Other than that, keep sending me those Yelp coupons and I will keep adding time to my exercise routine so I can eat my Mugsy Dogs!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal and thought that had a great variety to pick from. The fries were really good and I liked the Mugsy signature sauce. Excited to bring my family to try it."}
{"text":"Mugsy Dogs just opened!  It's right by my house and their gormet dogs are delicious.  What a great idea.  I had a polish dog with bacon and cheese on a pretzel bun with onion rings. You gotta try this place !!"}
{"text":"Great hotdogs! I had the gringo hot dog, it was delicious. The fries were crunchy and had seasoning on them too. It comes with homemade dipping sauce. I'll go back again. It's a really small place and not much seating, however the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Umm, delish! I love tjat its close to home and decent prices. Awesome fries! I also love that the yummy waffle truck shows up next door time to time.  Hot dog, then waffle dessert!"}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ pork sandwich and quick, friendly service. Great place for kids! We'll be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"Very good lunch.  My husband and daughter had the chili dogs and enjoyed them.  I had the Chicago dog and that was pretty good too. An order of fries is large enough for two people.  The staff were friendly and really quick preparing the food.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love Mugsy dogs. The place is clean, staff is great and the food is fantastic! I Love the convenience of ordering online and picking up the order....however I don't like that the menu isn't a complete one, online. My son's favorite was the pizza dog! Ordered it online, and only found out when I went in for pick up that they discontinued it a while ago. Not anything earth shattering....but in this day and age, having a convenience like online ordering is great, as long as it's maintained well!!  My fave: Mac n cheese dog."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very helpful staff and the spiral cut hotdogs are excellent. I liked the Chicago dog."}
{"text":"We love this place. We have gone there at least 10 times since they have opened. The food taste fresh,  the place is clean, and they have really nice employees. This place is my husband's happy place.  They also came to my kids Fall Festival and it was a big hit!!"}
{"text":"Finally! A dog place that has great food, a cute storefront, and reasonable prices. Ordered a classic Chicago dog (all the fixings), a chili dog (my kid's fave), and a gringo dog (complete with green sauce). Also got crunchy seasoned fries and a delish vanilla shake. All were excellent and served with a smile. We'll definitely be back again (and will keep an eye out for their food truck)!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! All the workers are friendly and the hot dogs are delicious and really filling! It's all so good I can't decide which hot dog is the best. If you like good food this is the place for you! I just wish I could give them more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Not even waiting to get home to write this review HANDS DOWN THE BEST HOT DOG I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE Easily beats out portillos...even my native Chicago husband agrees! Absolute foodgasm,  with none of the bad stomach feelings I always get after eating things like this Bbq pulled pork dog   I have many food allergies ... all their sauces are gluten free and I ordered it without onion rings and the bun...wouldn't have changed a thing about it I hope these guys get the opportunity to open up multiple locations one day! Plus the owner is the most friendly sociable person I've met.  Great job guys you have us for customers for life, glad we found our weekly eat out spot! Thank you thank you thank you!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I went a few weeks back. The food was not very good. The service was slow. We usually give restaurants at least two chances. It was so bad we could only do the one time."}
{"text":"Was craving a Chicago dog so we stopped here and were definitely not disappointed.  Had a Chicago dog, wife tried the macaroni dog, son had the chili dog and all were awesome. Definitely worth stopping in. Hot dogs are big size too."}
{"text":"First, I thought readers should have an honest review that isn't written by a friend, employee, family member, or partner.  Take a look at the positive reviews and you'll probably understand what I'm talking about. As for the rave reviews about \"cleanliness\", I should hope it's clean, it's only been open for 2 days!  Like a few others, we've been anxiously waiting for this to open for some time.  I frequent Lowe's and the idea of having a hot dog / burger place right next door is cool and convenient.   We went today, and sadly, we were pretty disappointed. We went on day two of their \"grand opening\" only to find they ran out of hamburgers, really!!  Look, when your only two major products are hot dogs and hamburgers, you shouldn't run out of either, especially when you've been open for less than 48 hours.      I decided to go with the Mac and Cheese dog on a pretzel bun.  The hot dog itself was OK, but nowhere near worth the $6+ I paid for it.  One problem was the Mac and Cheese, it was completely flavorless.  The macaroni was actually white, which would be OK if you used a white cheese, but that wasn't the case.  It was white because of the plain macaroni itself, it had no flavor at all.  The pretzel bun was was too dense and doughy, I'v had better at Sonic.    Most disappointing was the price.  For a family of 4 we spent over $30.00 and that was for two plain non-specialty dogs, one specialty dog, a kids meal, an order of fries, and onion rings. Fries are a la cart and cost $2.00.  I've seen more fries in a kids happy meal.  I thought maybe I ordered a small, then realized it's just one price and you don't get much.  I don't mind spending the money, but make it worth our while in both flavor and portion size.    The onion rings weren't bad, but again, overpriced.  I would love to support my local businesses and I'm not writing this because I want to bash them. I am writing this because I want the owners to succeed by using customers comments as a means to improve.  Right now, you don't get what you feel you pay for, and that will keep customers away.    Until they improve, my advice is to head down the street to Costco and get an awesome dog and a soda for $1.50, so much better than this place.  Really sad and very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch and I'm glad I did! It was well worth it. I had a burger and onion rings and they were yummy, try the shakes as well. Everyone is very polite and helpful. Strongly suggest it if your in the mood for a burger or dog."}
{"text":"Nice to have something different in the area for a change.  Went for lunch and it was pretty crowded, I had to wait for a seat.  Luckily I was able to find a seat before my food came.  The selection was good and everything tasted great.  Definitely give this place a try.  But be wary showing up in a big group...seating is limited"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I'm from Chicago and really miss great hot dog stands. Unfortunately, this place missed the mark for me. The buns are huge and remind me of hoagie buns, not hot dog buns. The hot dogs themselves were mediocre and the chili was not good at all. Fries were good...served with a sauce that was different, but ok."}
{"text":"Not my pick for hot dogs. Food is okay so if you're in a pinch it will do. Higley hot dog is 3 miles north and blows this place away. Beter food and prices. But you need cash."}
{"text":"Food is good. We had burgers and kids had mac n cheese and chicken nuggets. I will be back. Burgers are better than most places."}
{"text":"I really loved the blt dog! I was iffy about the bacon and dog being deep fried but once I let go of any doubts and trusted my taste buds and not my mind it was worth it. The toppings were fresh and the bun was so soft. The dog was crispy and delicious, I woke up this morning thinking of going back again. Wow choices!"}
{"text":"Great place. My wife and I have eaten here several times. The service has always been fast and friendly. The hot dogs and burgers are great."}
{"text":"I've already come back 3 times since I found this place. Love the mac n cheese dog and their onion rings are SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs galore! Went for the first time and took the family. We had different types of dogs, and the mugsy dog I think for the kids. Everybody loved their food, generous portions on the kids dogs for the sides and comes with the drink as well. We tried the chicago dog (was great!) the gringo dog (was really good too) and the chili dog (chili could have been better, but it was a chili dog chili type of chili lol) We will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good dogs. And really good fired. I got the Mac N Cheese dog. Weird but really good. It had bacon on top :)  Would come again."}
{"text":"Local hot dog joint with something for everyone. Chili cheese dog, they got it. Mac N Cheese dog they got it. You want waffles? They got waffles! I got the inside scoop tonight that in the near future they are going to have chicken nuggets. But seriously, they are worth a look see. Sincerely nice people who are part of the community that is Gilbert."}
{"text":"First time here.  Came for Weiner Wednesday.  Great service and the place is really clean.  I love the decor.  Prices are just a tad high for sides like onion rings.  I think the quantity should be bigger, but I must say he onion rings rate an A+.  Hot dogs are great.  They also have excellent Chicken Nuggets.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had the Mac and cheese dog. Omg it was so good and filling!! Hopefully this restaurant will come to the west valley closer to me! If that was the case this place would be a weekly treat!"}
{"text":"Mugsy dogs is DELICIOUS!! The staff is super friendly and you can tell they have a passion for their business! I have tried a couple of their dogs and the BLT and the gringo dog are THE most delicious hot dogs I have ever tasted. Go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place! They love the waffle wrapped hot dog. Good service, clean,  and a creative hot dog menu."}
{"text":"House hunting in the Gilbert/ queen creek area- we stopped and ate here. So many choices of hot dog combinations & kids meals. Only issue was seating but we sat outside and thankfully the sun wasn't too hot.   Chicago hot dog was on point!"}
{"text":"I just visited today and had a pleasant experience. I only live half a mile away. The hotdogs are great and I intend to return frequently to try the rest of the menu items and because of the great service I received!"}
{"text":"Me and a buddy had the gringo and the Mac and cheese dogs. Both were so good! Don't know which one I liked better. Both were different and amazing. The gringo tasted a lot like a street hot dog straight from Rocky Point Mexico just a little bit sweeter with their Mugsy sauce! The Mac and cheese was covered in bacon chunks and the Mugsy sauce ties it all in nicely as well."}
{"text":"Decent, but pricey.  $4 for a regular and $5 for a polish or Chicago seems a little high.  It's not nearby, but I'll take Ted's Hotdogs in Tempe any day."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We have been here about 5 times. We at first loved the hotdogs and would have given the place a 4.5 star rating. The hotdogs are plump, hot, flavorful and the toppings are piled on. The fries are ok, a bit too crispy for me at times. Anyone know what kind of oil they use for frying?? This place is small, it only has a few booths and a couple outside tables facing the Lowes parking lot. What we don't like is the some of the teens working there.  The food can take a while, especially with the employees looking at their phones and taking their time with everything.  I have yet to see an adult working or supervising here.   The menu is definitely limited, no salads or options for sides. One time we tried the hamburgers(I know we got a hamburger at a hotdog place) but considering the menu is so limited...we thought they would be good. They were not. The burgers were dry, no flavor, over cooked.   If you ask if the hot dogs are beef or if you have any allergens and want to know if there is any MSG in anything...you get a blank stare or a mumble. I have a reaction to the hotdogs so I am guessing there is soy and/or MSG.  The website says beef but that doesn't usually include the casing or oil used.   We have gotten the Rachel Dog(our favorite with Pastrami and slaw), BLT dog, Chicago Dog and Gringo Dog. All tasty with toppings piled on way more than other places. If the service was better incl. having an adult around & customers could get nutritional info on food, & the fries & hamburger upgraded we would be back , provided the allergens weren't there for me."}
{"text":"Came here today and was pretty excited to try it!  I got the Ruben dog- it was Ok! Nothing that special. All the flavors meshed together, leaving nothing exciting.  We also got a kids mac n cheese- boring, mushy, and very bland. !! Regular ole kraft mac would have been better, and eaten by my child.  Kids meal came with French fries, which were ok, but there was no ketchup to dip, which was a nessessity.  Might give another try with something eles."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my son here yesterday, he had the Ruben dog, I had the Chicago dog. Both were good, and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great place! Ordered delivery on DoorDash and I loved the food, so I decided to stop in and check it out in person. Amazing value for some very tasty food, also loved the decor!"}
{"text":"Pretty good hotdogs! The dogs are fresh tasting and yummy. The buns are perfect. Good flavor dogs. The cheese is shredded and the sauce that comes with the fries is sub par but the Mugsy Sauce is great! I would recommend this to others. Next time I'll try the BLT, which I hear is a fave!"}
{"text":"Super delicious!  After ordering takeout of half the menu, this place is definitely killer good. Their plain ole hotdogs taste delicious. I ordered the Reuben dog for myself and it was awesome. I particularly enjoyed their Mac and cheese and their onion rings. The fries had something left to be desired but my idaho heart loved the fry sauce. I also particularly enjoyed the Chicago dog. I'll definitely be back. I would classify this place as a midnight craving type of food"}
{"text":"My husband had the burger and I had a Chicago dog. My Chicago was very good, fresh with lots of flavor and the right amount of toppings. The hamburger is grilled and very flavorful, served on a warm bun. Definitely better than a typical burger at a burger joint. They don't have iced tea, if your not a soda drinker then you'll want to get a bottle of water.   Service was friendly and prompt. We wouldn't hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in the east valley! I've tried a few different specialty dogs and the hamburger and all were exceptional! My favorite specialty dog would probably be the gringo dog! The green sauce on it was so good. The waffle dog is also great if you're not super hungry, I like that they use their own corn batter and each waffle dog is made to order(never frozen). Also, the \"mugsy sauce\" is very tasty. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Also the customer service is always outstanding! Job well done!"}
{"text":"It's alright. I was so hungry for chili hot dog. Found this place through Yelp because the reviews. Chili hot dog is very salty and not much chili flavor. Felt like tomato ground beef on top of hot dog. Onion ring is amazing."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. Great service, perfect hot dogs, and even better burgers."}
{"text":"Very good dog and exceptionally good bun. Chili fries were ok, nothing special. Great atmosphere, nice people, a bit pricey. $6 for a hot dog? They need more tables, there only about 10 tables including outside. Huge line but they were able to get things out quickly. They were out of corn dogs, that's really what I wanted.  Took the kids tonight, they loved the Mac n cheese dog,  and onion rings were delish..   Owners and staff, extremely nice. Great place to enjoy a dog with the family."}
{"text":"craving for chili cheese fries? this is the place to go!!! my boyfriend was craving for it the last couple days and we found this place. the place is nice and clean and the people are friendly :) for the price its pretty reasonable, i paid $6 for a hotdog and $ 4 for the chili cheese fries and it was tasty! they just opened for 2 weeks and worth checkin out"}
{"text":"Terrific food from nice owners.  I always get the Chili Cheese Dog and it is one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The three of us that were dining there all enjoyed our food. The young lady at the cash register was not exactly friendly, which was not a great welcome for first time customers. The line was out the door, which is awesome for the business, but there were a limited number of tables.  We will likely go back sometime to try some of the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Weenie Wednesday sucked me in for a half price dog and just couldn't decide on one so I ordered two.  I've driven by running to Lowes a few times and since I'm a proud member of the Arizona Big Dogs club and enjoy a fine frankfuerter from time to time,  I owed it to the connoisseurs of coneys to try this place out.   The cheese dog was amazing. With much more than a squirt of hot chedder,  this blissful dog made me bark with joy.   The second dog I devoured was simply called the HOT Dog... with spicy brow mustard, jalepenos, oniins ave hatch green chilies I can attest to this Mugsy inferno.   So fresh a delicious I have to rank Mugsy high on the Coney Sale.  While the Arizona Big Dogs have yet to assign an official ranking to Mugsy, I will go out on a limb and say it's soon to be a top 10 contender in the state.   Don't delay a swing by Mugsy today.  Especially if it's Weenie Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Slaw dog was tasty. The BBQ pork dog was fantastic. Fries were delicious. Max and cheese was average. My kids enjoyed a burger and pizza dogs. I will definitely be back to try other dogs. Service was quick and food was hot. I love that it is a local place and not a chain. All the staff were polite and helpful. Doug was extremely friendly! Thanks mugsy dogs!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Mugsy Dogs for the first time this week. Me and my daughter love hotdogs. And we wanted to give this local newer place a try.  I had the Chicago Dog and a double cheeseburger and she had a chili dog. My burger was amazing it was so thick and juicy. It was grilled to perfection. My Chicago dog was great as well. My daughter said her chilli dog a lot. The fries were great and the fry sauce is delicious. My only complaint and one thing j don't understand is the they have kids meals for $5 which include a hotdog fries and a drink. Which I feel is a fair price for sure. But my daughter wanted a chilli dog which wasn't one of options for the kids meal. I asked if there was anyway to put chilli on her dog I was willing to pay for it. The lady at the register asked the cook and said No I would have to order the chilli dog which is a $6 dollar item. I don't understand why it would be hard to add chilli to a hotdog for something like $1 but to have to spend $6 bucks plus buy $2 frys and drink so the kids meal goes up to $10. I know that if my seem  like I'm being picky but I wasn't asking for the cheese or the onions or any thing else but maybe a couple spoons full of chilli. We will try the place again for sure the food is good! Just wish they could make a exception on the one issue I had. Overall I would recommend this place if you like dogs and hamburgers."}
{"text":"Food was fine, however it was cold. My husband ordered the Chili burger and it doesn't say in the description that there is Mugsy sauce all over it. He is not a fan of sweet sauce and his chili burger was covered in the Mugsy sauce. Lady who took who took our order, older gal with red hair,  was not the most pleasant human being....lacking in customer service. I will say that their onion rings are amazing. Overall...nothing spectacular. Could've been better if food was hot, customer service was good and descriptions of food were accurate. Mugsy sauce is not for everyone so if you're going to put it on your food, make sure it says so in the description."}
{"text":"Happy to have a new spot nearby! Kids love this place, fries are great and obviously the hot dogs are awesome. I really hope they add a chicken sandwich, turkey hot dog or veggie burger!"}
{"text":"I will echo the sentiments of previous reviewer Jim B, the Chicago dog is anything but a Chicago dog. None of the correct ingredients. Since ordering, and disappointment of the CD I am struggling to find something on the menu that I can be excited about. I too hate to write this because I would like to see a family business succeed.    The people that own Mugsy are wonderful and I really do wish them well. My wife and kids, on the other hand, really like this place."}
{"text":"Fun little place! I love local food places. This one plays great music and there was a happy guy singing along as he worked behind the counter. I love seeing people happy at work, and they always make a better product. The vibe is fun & light.  The food came quickly, and I enjoy watching food being made. My son (not a big eater) scarfed his Jr. Mugsy Dog and his fries (kids meal) and asked for another dog. I ordered one more for him at the counter and before I could sit down, a nice young lady handed his 2nd hot dog to him.  I ordered a Polish and a side of fries. I was pleased with the size of the fries, and they were my favorite- crispy on the outside, fluffy in the middle, and HOT!   They come with a cup of fry sauce (mmmm!) and I went and got a second one because it was tasty and there were that many fries.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place has great hot dogs. My husband had the Chicago Dog I had the Cheese Dog and we shared the chili cheese fries. Great Service Good Price. Good Location we will come again."}
{"text":"Mugsy Dogs is a hidden gem. They combined unique flavors and traditional style hot dogs. The place is clean and very welcoming. Most of all family friendly. They actually have enough high chairs."}
{"text":"Growing up in Chicago I know hotdogs.  I saw this place opening up near my home so I had to give it a try.  The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  I had the chili dog w no cheese and my wife had a mugsy dog.  We also ordered fries and onion rings.  Our dogs came out and the chili dog had cheese on it.  No biggie and it was fixed quickly.    My dog was very good but the chili could have been hotter.  It was lukewarm but still very good.    My wife liked her dog but said the bun could have been more fresh.   The onion rings were very good as well as the fries.   Our bill was 19 dollars,  which seems a bit steep but not too crazy.   Overall we were pleased and will be back.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Remember it's a hotdog joint but with that said it's pretty darn good. The hotdogs are grilled and not boiled thank god...do wish they had salads like home made potato salad, macaroni salad etc.. It's was very clean. I will say it was a little pricey two hotdogs two drinks and 1 small bag of chips was $19. staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I always get the gringo dog thanks to my mom who brought me here! Come from all the way from Chandler because Im addicted, I want it at least once a week  i met kevin and he was very down to earth and it shows he really cares about delivering great food! Nailed it! So far the gringo, chili, and pizza dog are great.  Fries and mac n cheese are awesome."}
{"text":"I see many great reviews but my experience with my brother was not the best. I have had way better dogs especially for how much the dogs and burgers cost. Only thing I was good with was the fries and onion rings. I've had some great dogs in Chicago and NY but this had no wow factor for us. I don't think I will give it a try again. Give it a try maybe I had an off day."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge hot dog fan usually but I absolutely love Mugsy Dogs! Their gringo is delicious. I've had it a few times now and every time is just as good. My husband took his employees here and they all haven't stopped talking about how good it was. I'm not sure what the negative reviews are talking about cause this place is awesome! Service is very friendly and has always been prompt. I'm really impressed with how quickly the staff was able to be up and running to have things run smoothly. Will definitely be back and recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Visited this spot while on vacation. The BLT dog was amazing. They're house sauce on the hotdogs was good. Service was fast, and food was great. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Diet Coke - kind of like in and out only better with some great looking hot togs - I had the hamburger and onion rings both exactly what you want and a little bigger. In the Togo they included fry Saudi and ranch which was a pleasant surprise - very upbeat staff. Small business that deserves our support.  Same parking lot as firehouse subs"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Simple, cooked well with fresh ingredients.  Good crispy fries.  Will come here as an alternative to the TERRIBLE food and service at nearby Sonic and Tailgaters (which closed, thank goodness)."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I love hot dogs and it's really close. First the good news, they carry coke products. It's very clean and staff are very friendly. There are a few sit down booths, and they carry some kid size meals. Our orders came as ordered and fairly quickly. It was busy and everything is made to order. Now the bad news. I ordered a standard mugsy dog, with pickles, mustard and onions. $4. Dog was quite small by AZ standards. There was way more bun than dog. Which might have been OK if the bun was not hard and dry. My wife ordered the chili dog, $6, and her dog appeared larger. Chili was fine, a little cheese and onions. All fresh.  She didn't eat her bun. They take them right out of the bag, no steam, no grill just a dry hard bun. Not even the chili could save it. Fries were pretty good, but they are seasoned which I am not a fan of. Lots of other things to try yet, including burgers so I won't give up yet. But come on guys, step up your bun game!!!! Higley Hotdog will remain my greasy spoon of choice!!!"}
{"text":"Everything we have tried was very good. Quick,  friendly service and tons of options to customize your order. We've been at least 4 or 5 times and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The Dogs are good but the burgers are great!  If I need a good Cheeseburger-  this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs. Tad Expensive but delicious. I needed to eat 3 of them to get full lol. All around good. 1 star loss for expensive pricing. It's a beefed up hot dog !"}
{"text":"Really great, freshly made food.  Love the cheese fries and burgers!  Small business should be supported and this place feels like a family establishment."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with the service I received and their food is so good! I honestly knew nothing about this place and then I looked at the menu, and decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did! The Mac and Cheeseburger is INCREDIBLE. I've liked everything I have tried. Yummmmmmm! :)"}
{"text":"It's a Polish dog.  It was good.  Pretty simple.  Don't expect 5-star dining at a hot dog joint.    Do expect, however, a clean restaurant and friendly staff.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm not a person to go out for a Hot Dogs.  I mean how hard is it to just cook your dogs and get some buns, so easy and cheap.  Well my husband and I went to Lowe's to check out some BBQ Grills and lawn furnitures and we kinda lost time.  Next thing you know we were really hungry, REALLY HUNGRY.  Mugsy Dogs opened not so long ago so we decided to try this local place.  It's small and there are few tables for family of four.  Also there are two bars with stools  We ordered 1 Mugsy Hamburger, 1 Mugsy Dog and Chili fries.  I wasn't really impressed with the burger or the dog.  Few weeks later we went to Lowe's for potting soil and again we got the munchies.  We decided to go back to Mugsy because first time I was there I saw waffle dog and I wanted to try it.  This time I ordered waffle corn dog and my husband ordered Mac and cheese dog.  OH MY DAYS was it good!!!  We weren't that hungry but that waffle dog with maple syrup was delicious.  And that mac and cheese dog was out of this world good.  I would totally pay good money for those dogs.  I won't go back for hamburgers but will be returning to try their dogs for sure!  I wish my stomach was bigger so I could have two of those mac and cheese dogs and order of waffle dog;)"}
{"text":"They opened one by our house and my son loves to go there! Very clean, service has always been great"}
{"text":"We ordered take out and had a very delicious meal.  Onion rings were incredible.  Yummy fries.  Killer hot dogs.  The gringo Dog was amazing.  Our burgers were yummy but so greasy and sloppy and hard to eat, like running down my arms messy.  But that isn't the worst thing...  Mugsy Sauce was delicious.  Green sauce was divine.  And fry sauce.  FRY SAUCE.  FRY SAUCE!  The location is great and very well decorated and clean but very small.  We will be back and I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! We ordered a mugsy burger and a chili hot dog with onion rings and french fries. Everything was YUMMY! Hubby added another patty and bacon and mmmmmmm... Service is another plus, everybody was friendly, helpful and super nice. Prices are fair and the restaurant is modern, nice. Tables outside also. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"These hot dogs are so good it's crazy! Thick, juicy, yum. The bacon wrapped dogs.... Mmmm! The chili cheese fries have so much chili & cheese you can't go wrong! The fry sauce is also yum! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Just visited within the hour and I have no idea how you have any positive reviews. I ordered a hamburger with extra pickles (apparently that means one pickle to you), ordered a chili cheese dog no onion ( that meant to someone to load with as much onion add humanly possible), and ordered cheese fries ( that meant to someone that it needed chili too). Then I call as we got our order to go ask to speak to a manager only to be told we are busy. Completely deflecting my question, then told to call back after 3 unless i am placing a order... Are you serious?! Someone intentionally f***** my order up and someone wont even take the 2 minutes to speak with me? Call back praying someone besides Debbie will answer the phone, but no she answers says hold then disconnected the call. Tried a third time to call and once again only willing to have someone talk to me if they can have more of my money. The absolute WORST experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Ok I hate writing this review because it's a small family owned joint. I ordered the Chicago dog and it was anything but. Maybe growing up in Chicago I'm a hot dog snob but if you are going to charge me $5.00 for a \"Chicago Dog\" I expect it to taste like Chicago. Not a hot dog I could make at home..  Hamburger pickles instead of a spear Sweet relish instead of neon relish  A Vienna beef dog would be nice too.. plus you need a steam table to pull it off.  On an upbeat note the onion ring were good.  If you come here and your from Chicago skip the Chicago dog, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I typically do not enjoy hotdogs. I find them to often be overly salty. A while back my guy got so excited with his first check in and said this place was so good, he had to checkin.  Well, Saturday afternoon, and we happen to be heading to Lowes... swing by and see Mugsy Dogs. I went with a Chicago dog because well, mostly because of the sport peppers.   We take a seat listen to what I identify as classic rock (not oldies) and within a few minutes our order comes out. Looks great, has all the fixins a Chicago dog should have. Upon first taste, I'm waiting for the nitrates and super salty flavors to set in. I seriously was waiting to be disappointed, that's just how mich dogs aren't for me. However, that didn't happen. I'm not sure if it was the fancy spiral pattern on the dog, or the dog itself but I have to say, it was very likely one of the vest hotdogs I have had.   No drive through, walk in only but I may actually be back soon to bring the kid and give him a chance to give any if the many offerings a try."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place. It was a little drive, but totally worth it. My wife and I got mugsy dogs with fries and onion rings. Great cook on the meat and the topping were fantastic. Fries and onion rings were done right. I love higley hot dog. This place is better. It's worth driving a few extra miles to give this place a try. Not sure what these negative reviews are about either. My experience was great! Customer service was also fantastic. Can you tell that I am a fan?"}
{"text":"We were excited to see this place open especially after the disaster that is Higley Hotdog Hut. I thought this place was pretty awesome. Store isn't open yet but should be a few weeks away, right now they operate out of a food truck/trailer. I thought the dogs themselves were great. Good quality and great flavor. We tried a Waffle dog and it was an awesome take on a classic. The bun was more of a roll style which isn't my personal preference but we will still go back!"}
{"text":"Was so disappointed. We drove quite a ways to come to eat at this new establishment. The Buns were stale, the hot dogs were mildly warm, and the fries and onion rings had sat for quite some time because they were hardened and very crisp. We will not return. We will continue to head to Tempe to Ted's Hot Dogs."}
{"text":"Please refrigerate your fry sauces and other sauces that are just sitting out on the counter."}
{"text":"Hot Dogs! Anyway you want it & more! Hubby had the Mac & Cheese hot dog & loved it. Also serve fries & hamburgers anyway you want them!"}
{"text":"If you get cravings for hot dogs like I did, you will drive out of your way to get your mouth around a couple of the Chicago dogs here. The special barbecue sauce is worth trying to. Staff was eager to please and I got there accidentally on a half off  Wednesday making it easier to justify getting a third dog!"}
{"text":"Love Mugsy! The owner is awesome, super nice guy! Quaint little place with great specialty items, hotdogs & burgers. This is usually our go to place when we're not sure what to eat or want something quick."}
{"text":"I am in love with the Rachel dog. Literally it brings me back here weekly.  I tried the Rueben today and it was also very good but the Rachel is amazing! Definitely highly recommend. That is if you love pastrami on your hot dog. There French fries are also superb."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy! Doug at the front counter was very helpful, I had the mac n' dogs and chili cheese fries (don't judge)! Food was out fast and it was hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Quality restaurant. We aren't people that actively seek a \"good hot dog joint\" but live across the street from here and figured we would give it a try. We are definitely glad we did. We enjoyed the Mac n cheese dogs and the BBQ dog. Also the fries are very good. All in all a good meal."}
{"text":"Fun little spot. Cute decor, decent selection. I had the \" Hot\" dog, hubby had a double burger and daughter had the waffle dog!"}
{"text":"Great idea! Love the idea! Prices are decent! I've tried a couple different ones and they are all delish! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! IMHO it's better than Ted's and it's closer to home for me so win-win. Service was good and the place was surprisingly efficient considering how busy they were (standing room only except outside). The prices are good and the portions are huge. I got a Gringo dog and a Chicago style and was stuffed.. Should have stuck with just 1. The gringo dog is a meal in itself. Long story short- the wife & kids loved it, food was fast a delicious / will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super great burgers and dogs! I love stopping for lunch on my way thru the area. I always get my food quick. Friendly staff... and fry sauce too!"}
{"text":"Well Mugsy......you done me proud. I had noticed this place going up a few months ago, and what better way to treat ourselves to a few Hot Dogs, than to go in on Taco Tuesday. lol   First Timer: When we first arrived, I noticed it was a very clean place. The menu was very simple, but it's what we came for. I ordered the BBQ Pork Dog (Mugsy Dog, Baked Beans, Pulled Pork, Cheddar Cheese, Onion Rings) and my wife ordered the Chili Dog (Mugsy Dog, Chili, Onion, Shredded Cheddar). Both dogs were $6 which I thought was odd. I would have thought that the Chili Dog should have been priced about $5.50. They don't have any combo meals, so you have to order Fries and/or Drinks a la carte.   Taste: The fries were OK. Nothing special, but still better than your typical fast food joint. The fries sauce reminded me of Freddie's \"secret sauce\" (mayo/ketchup mix) lol! So let me get to what you came here for....the Mugsy Dogs! OMFG my BBQ Pork hot dog was amazing. You HAVE to order it with the poppyseed bun though. I couldn't even get a picture of it because I sucked it down so fast. Such deliciousness. Pretty much the best hot dog I have ate. My wife was just as impressed with her chili dog. My daughter also stated that the kids Mugsy Jr. was the best hot dog she has had.   Employees were all nice and chipper. The manager (I believe it was wearing a white t-shirt) that was on duty was a trip. He was singing to Justin Timberlake, and I was rather impressed with his great voice. Must be an inspiring Karaoke star. lol   We will definitely  be back!! Thanks Mugsy!!"}
{"text":"I ordered cheese dog, fries and onion rings. The hot dog bread was bad. The fried were Ehhh, but the onion rings were good. My daughter ordered Mac n cheese w/hot dogs and she didn't like it. How bad does it have to be for a kid not to like mac n cheese? The wife ordered a hot dog as well and was also disappointed. We spent $21 for this...I want a refund. This was my first and last time ordering here."}
{"text":"Really good hot dogs...  If this is your first time reading about this place...their hot dogs should obviously be the 1st thing you try. I haven't tried the burgers yet...but it will come. Everything is reasonably priced. Seating is a little limited in my opinion for a busy lunch hour. Customer service was excellent. Great location right off of the 202. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Expensive and just ok!! I really wanted to like it because my youngest son loves hotdogs, but I'd take him to Costco before going back, sorry :("}
{"text":"I honestly wasn't a fan. Maybe it was because I had to wait over 45 minutes for a plain hotdog (Chicago style) with a side of fries. Would have been nice to be told the wait would be so long. Or even offered a discount / free drink or a simple apology for the long wait.   When I finally got my dog it wasn't even warm. It was more on the cold side with a bun that was hard/stale. I really wanted this to be my new spot but it left me with a bad taste In My mouth. However, the fries were pretty damn tasty.   Not sure if I'll be back. Maybe after they work all the so call kinks out. May just have to go to Higley Hut a few blocks down."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped hot dog was great.  A little pricy for a hotdog but it was good.  Friendly staff. I'll try some of the other items and write a better review."}
{"text":"Amazing food at an affordable price. I wish the fries (which are so delicious) were included but that's my only gripe. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place tonight. It was quite pleasant and the food came out quick. Would return again."}
{"text":"Great find! We've passed by Mugsy Dogs a bunch but never around meal time....but today was the day! Growing up in the Chicago area I have a found spot for hot dogs (they remind me of the ballpark)....but wow they have so many great options outside a traditional chicago dog.   All dogs are grill - Total win! -Mac and Cheese dog - Can you say YUMMY!? -Fries were fresh - seasoned well and wow! the fry sauce was great! (enough to share if you each have a dog)  Doug was super nice as well as the rest of the staff. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the positives: Friendly staff, Very clean, Quick service. However, we weren't super impressed with the food. In fact, my hamburger was nearly inedible. The patties had way too much salt on them (maybe an accident?) and the bun had too much \"bread\" on it and the texture was odd. I also wasn't a fan of the buns on the kids hot dogs. The buns felt cold and too hard. My kids ending up eating the hot dog without the bun. I am willing to give this place another shot in the future because I love to support local non-chains... but for now, Costco has better dogs!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs & fries. Great for a quick bite on the go or to sit & relax. We had the Mac & Cheese hot dog and the BLT hot dog. Both we awesome. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Just had a late lunch here. The guys were very friendly, and that's always a plus in the middle of the work day.   I had Chicago style hotdog. I prefer my buns to be grilled but other than that, it was well done (and I'm from Chicago, so I know a little about the hot dogs).  The fries were delicious, with seasoned salt and a good mayo/ketchup sauce.   The food was hot when I got home (6 mins away) so no complaints and as I mentioned above, the guys were super friendly, the restaurant was clean , organized and quiet.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here fir the first time today. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. We asked what the popular ones were she said the chili dog and the gringo dog. But then she told us her favorite which was the Reuben dog. We went with the Chili dog and the Reuben and the did not disappoint!  We also couldn't decide between fries or onion rings so we went with a 1/2 & 1/2 order. The chili was good and my Reuben dog was yummy!  Good recommendations!! The fries were freshly made as were the onion rings....they were SO good. The fry sauce was good to!  Can't wait to go back and try other versions or you can build your own!  Only thing that would have made this perfect was if they served Pepsi!!  But you can't have it all...we will definitely be trying this again. Prices were very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs. They should definitely think about expanding the business! It would do great in Tempe near ASU or even ball parks. So good!"}
{"text":"This place recently open up near me and I thought I would give it try. Looking at some of the reviews I thought I be in for a pretty good experience. Unfortunately it was just mediocre. I got two Dogs and here were what I found to be issues that could not be over looked.   First, both hot dogs were not even hot, wasn't even warm bordering on hot, they were just slightly warm. Not even sure how that is possible with the dogs coming straight off the grill.   Second, i decided to get a snapper as they are a rare find and was excited to see on the menu. Now i know they state spiral cut hot dog, but by spiral cutting a snapper you have ruined the most most important part of a snapper hot dog which is that snap when you bite into it.   Third the Chili Dog, I don't want to say this because I have no proof but what my taste buds tell me. I swear thought; that is \"hormel\" chili they put on the dog. Either that or they are using so much bland chili powder in there chili that the taste is mimicking Hormel flavor. It completely run the dog for me and could not finish. At least the chili was hot.  For the Pros,  The Staff was super friendly and the buns were OK.  I don't think i could recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow, Mugsy Dogs was a nice find. Went to Lowes to browse a few things and caught this place out ofd the corner of my eye. Decided to hop over after shopping and the family was very happy with our meals. The interior is small and cozy with sort of a 50's diner theme. The menu is easy- dogs or burgers- but there are many varieties of each. Wife went with the All American and I had the chili cheese dog. Fries are large so we shared 2 between the 3 of us. There's no kids hamburger option (?) so we had to order the full size cheeseburger (of which she ate less than a 1/3). There are other kid options though- from corn dogs to hot dogs. We paid around $25 for 2 specialty dogs, the cheeseburger, 2 fries and 3 drinks- not bad IMHO.  Staff was very friendly- giving a full-smiled greeting when we entered the restaurant. The guy behind the counter was willing to talk us through the menu- made some suggestions and the order process was very quick. We filled our soda drinks, found a table and the food was served within 10 minutes or so.   The hot dogs are grilled and were both cooked to perfection. A little crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Buns were super fresh and toppings were excellent. My cheese dog was smothered in chili, cheese, and onion. It was very tasty. The french fries were crisp and fresh! There are condiments table side- you get the traditional choices like ketchup and mustard. There's also \"fry sauce\" which is a blend of mayo and ketchup with some spices. Coke products for the drinks. They also mix fresh milkshakes if you like a frozen treat like that with your hamburger. I also thought the onion rings smelled really good- maybe next.  And yes, there will be a next time when we find ourselves out that way again. Well done Mugsy!"}
{"text":"Great hot dog place. Good variety and good quality. Thrifty ice cream shakes. My new favorite hot dog! Lots of fresh condiments to make a perfect dog."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Mugsy Dogs one time. My husband is from Chicago so we def know a good Chicago dog. Unfortunately Mugsy Dogs is not it. I basically got a huge handful of raw onion on a soggy hot dog bun. When i actually got to the hot dog it was super cold. It was disappointing to say the least. Esp for the price the product was totally unacceptable. Service was slow and not very friendly at all. The only reason this got 2 stars from me was due to the cheese fries. Those were the only thing i enjoyed about the meal. Needless to say this will be our first and last time at Mugsy dogs."}
{"text":"I worried at first that a restaurant that specialized in hot dogs would lack the variety to keep me coming back but Mugsy Dogs was a refreshing dining experience. The staff looked happy to be there and all were knowledgeable and helpful about the menu.  I hate that moment when you stand awkwardly looking at the menu and the cashier stands there looking back awkwardly at you but Ashlyn was outgoing enough to help with questions while still allowing me to explore the menu on my own.  I ordered a Mac and Cheese dog. The Mac and cheese was creamy and had just enough flavor to compliment the hot dog. My wife ordered a hamburger and fries.  For a hot dog place, their hamburger looked and tasted pretty great!  I will definitely be back to Mugsy Dogs. I am eager to try out the Gringo dog and the waffle corn dog.   Oh yeah!  Last note.  That Mugsy Sauce is legit, legit, legit. Kevin the manager wouldn't tell me what was in it.  He only told me that it was a secret family recipe and that i'd have to join the Mugsy family to learn the secret!  I could seriously drink the stuff."}
{"text":"Great dogs and great service. Everyone was happy with what they ordered. We ordered the gringo, chili cheese, the Chicago and the bar b q dog."}
{"text":"So good. Seriously. The fam and I went there tonight. We all split the Gringo, Pulled Pork, BLT and Mac and Cheese dogs..... Amazeballs. My kids loved the Mac and cheese one! We all seemed to have a favorite- but they were all very good! Staff seems super nice and all of our food was hot when we got it. We will definitely be back again and will highly recommend to our friends!"}
{"text":"We do not each a lot of meat in our family, so a hot dog and burger restaurant is a questionable place for us to dine. BUT, we love their cheese fries (or just their fries in general!) but the gooey melty cheese on those perfect fries... ugh yum!! They also have tasty onion rings. Super crunchy! And my son likes their Kids Mac n Cheese! I tasted it, fo tha review, and it is in fact yummy and creamy!   My fam loves the waffle corn dog and my son has actually chowed down on the chicken nuggets. ^With that being said, both those items are SMALL. If my 2 year old can finish an entire kids meal, then an older child may want to just order sides instead of from kids meal.^ My relatives have eaten here with us and love the Gringo dog or just simply the fact that you can build your own hot dog! No one has tried a burger here yet.   Its a fun little place (it's not huge but they did a great job trying to fit as much seating as possible in here)   The employees are always helpful and nice and the food comes out quickly! We love us some Mugsy!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot.  I would suggest the more basic hot dogs- for one reason.  The hot dogs taste really good on their own!   Nice people quick staff and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"We have visited Mugsy Dogs in Gilbert twice now. The first time, I had a mac 'n cheese dog and the second visit I tried a double cheeseburger and my wife had a reuben dog. First, this place is CLEAN! as in immaculate. The employees are courteous and friendly. The mac n' cheese dog was great, it had macaroni and cheese, mugsy sauce, and bacon. Very unique taste. The double cheeseburger was honestly one of the best burgers I have had in a long time. It looked like it came on a brioche bun and was probably about 1/2 pound. My wife's reuben dog had kraut, swiss cheese, and pastrami on it. She said it was delicious.   We have tried both the chili cheese fries and the regular fries. The fries are great in any style. Freshly cooked and flavorful. They also have fry sauce, which is a big deal if you are originally from Utah, as we are. It's available everywhere in Utah (even McDonald's), but hard to find here in AZ. My only complaint is that they have such limited seating space, and the booths they do have are small and cramped. Aside from that, this is a very good place for hot dogs and burgers and it's locally owned. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here one day after the original place we were going to eat was closed.   This place has really good hot dogs with awesome toppings.  We all enjoyed the food we ordered, it was all delicious."}
{"text":"First time here and it was good. My hubby and I shared the cheeseburger and the chili dog with fries and onion rings. It was good and didn't take long to get our food. If we were \"in the area\" like we were today we would probably eat there again but I wouldn't drive 20 mins from home to go. the decor is fun :)"}
{"text":"Creative menu and really good food! Customer service was on point. I was really impressed by the upbeat and welcoming spirit the girl had at the cashier. This place is great!!"}
{"text":"Mugsy dog gets 3 stars merely for the fact that the 100% pure beef hot dog itself wrapped in bacon and deep fried was tasty.  The rest of the experience gets 2 stars. I ordered a $6BLT dog with onion rings and a small drink and it was $11.32.  The onion rings were a la carte and were $3 alone and you get exactly 8 onions rings.  I received only 7 and 2 of them were the size of a 50 cent piece. I mentioned it and they kindly made it right giving me 5 extra rings that were all larger.  A dozen rings for $3 would be more acurate than the over priced $3 for 8 in my opinion.  Also, I had asked if some how I could pay the $3 price and get half onion rings and half fries (yes 4 onion rings and then some fries) they said no.  It would be nice to offer a 50/50 ring and fry mix for $3 (especially since the fries are only $2). The BLT dog sounds great but it was ruined by the fact that they served it on a cool bun....not even room temp. Not good. The coke fountain drink is not good (McDonalds) still does their fountain drinks the best with right calibrations.  I would come back for another dog, but would make sure the warmed bun was just that...warm. I would like to try some of the other unique dogs on the menu."}
{"text":"While they wait for the brick and mortar to finish, these owners opened a food trailer.  What a great dog.  Original styles with fantastic grilled dogs.  Ingredients were top notch.  Even the root beer was fantastic.  Can't wait until they open the permanent location on March 1."}
{"text":"Craving a Chicago Dog, Mugsy was the closest to my home and had great reviews. This place was super busy on a Saturday afternoon (good sign) so service was a little slow. Ordered the Chicago Mugsy style and fries. The fries were really great, the dog, not so much. I am not an expert on Chicago dogs, but this one was missing the charm of the bright green relish and was so overloaded with toppings I couldn't taste the hot dog and the bun fell apart.  Additionally, I only got 1 sport pepper and 2 slim slices of pickle chips (usually they are spears right?) If I were seriously craving a hot dog and decided to go back to Mugsy, I would probably opt for a waffle corn dog."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit and the food was delicious!  The food wait was a little longer than expected, given the full house, but it was well worth the wait.  I had gringo dog and cheese fries, and the fam got a couple of BBQ pork burgers and a kids' mac n cheese, all very good.  We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of hot dogs but this was awesome. Never had a gourmet hot dog and I could really taste the difference. The service was very friendly and the time to get the entire family order out was very prompt. Will come again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff cooks up a culinary delight. Take the whole family. Most meals are $6 or less."}
{"text":"Had lunch this afternoon, polish dog and a side of chili cheese fries.  Everything was great!  Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch at this hot dog restaurant.  I got mine NY style (kraut dog) and my wife got hers All-American.  Our daughter got a corn dog which had an awesome waffle coating and even came with maple syrup for dipping.  They have HUGE cups for the soda fountain.  We liked their fancy quartz tables."}
{"text":"Love me some chili dogs and this place is Damn good. So glad I finally was able to come here. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open as it was right down the street from my house. I ordered a Chicago dog and Polish sausage and my wife had a Chicago dog and fries. We both thought the hot dog was just okay. The bun wasn't fresh and tasted like it was frozen and then thawed. It was a bit pricey at $5.00 a dog. The fries were average at best. Hope this place turns in around."}
{"text":"Only ate here once. Too much bun (stale) versus size of hot dog.  Did not enjoy the dog, nothing special with the onion rings. For the money and quality, we will choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and friendly service! Everyone in our group loved what they ordered. My 4 year old said,  \"I don't like my hot dog, I love it!\" Ha ha! We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise! Didn't even know they were open yet. My husband had the Chicago dog and I had the BLT. Delicious! And they had fry sauce!"}
{"text":"Really good hotdog place. Friendly staff, yummy burgers and fries. My husband had the slaw dog and gringo dog and was very impressed. I had a hamburger which was-dare I say- a little better than five guys. We will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  Hubby went and picked us up some burgers and dogs for dinner. He said service was great and the place was a cute  diner vibe and clean. Burgers were so good! I had a craving for a cheesy burger and it was fulfilled. Cooked to order perfectly! We split some chili cheese fries and they were good too. My only complaint is I wish they put the chili in a styrofoam container by itself. Instead it was on the red checkered paper, then put into the styrofoam. So by the time it made it home it was soggy paper and chili.  I want to go with the Hubby next time. Definitely will get a cheeseburger again and I want to try the onion rings."}
{"text":"Came at 4 and it wasn't busy.  Frys were not very fresh.  Had the mugsy dog,  and give it a 3 out of 5. The beans tasted like they came right out of the can.  Chicago dog was fine give it 2.5,  not the best I've tasted by a long shot.  Missing the real relish that comes on a real Chicago style dog.  Pricing was a bit steep too."}
{"text":"Got the Chicago dog that wasn't a Chicago dog bread was stale the only reason I Gave 2 stars is because the actual hotdog had a good taste to it"}
{"text":"This was really good for a hot dog place. They have some pretty good specialty dogs. Mac & cheese dog was amazing, pulled pork dog was legit and the chili cheese dog was super good. We also had the waffle dog, not my favorite but it was a decent shot at adding a twist to a corn dog. All in all if you are looking for a unique hot dog I would definitely check this place out. Service is a little slow right now but I think it's just the new employees trying to get the hang of everything. They've only been open a few weeks."}
{"text":"We were excited to have a new place to eat and close by, but our first experience wasnt what we hoped for. Positives: employees were friendly, clean inside and the menu looked like a good variety of dogs. We ordered a Chicago Dog for my wife, a Mugsy Dog with mustard and kraut for myself and a cheese fries that we were splitting. As we ordered I saw a dog come off the grill that looked amazing, had angled cuts in it and steaming hot. Well, that for sure was not either of our dogs as both were warm at best. My bun would have been much better had it come out of steamer to give it a hint of softness and this is just a personnal prefernce but I like my kraut to be hot like my dog, not cold like it was just taken out of the fridge. Just a suggestion, maybe ask the clients if the want hot or cold kraut and if they want hot, just throw some on the grill real quick to heat it up.  Then the fries they had on the tray when our name was called were chili cheese fries when we ordered just cheese fries. They appologized and were going to make us a new order, problem is that we finished our hot dogs and my wife still had to go up to the counter to ask for them. We are used to Higley Dogs cheese fries which has a great melted cheese sauce on it, tonight they were fries with shredded cheese melted on top, pretty lack luster when it came to compare a cheese sauce with flavor.  We will probably give them one more shot some time down the road, but will give them some time to figure things out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for my family's first visit to Mugsy Dogs today. Top notch friendly service from the moment we stepped in the door to the time we left. Everything was perfectly made as we ordered it and the cashier was extremely friendly and went out of her way to ensure our satisfaction.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I felt adventurous and heard about Mugsy's creative take on hot dogs, so we came down to check it out!  The manager was really nice and down to earth with a good sense of humor.  We ordered the Mac and cheese dog, the Reuben dog and the Gringo dog and split them so we could both try each of them.  Yum!!!  Each one still had the delicious flavor of a good hot dog and the bun held up to the massive messy ingredients loaded on them.  The toppings made each dog unique with its own flavors that all blended well together!  We loved them all and couldn't decide, but the Mac and cheese was definitely a comfort food!  We will be back for sure!  Maybe try the burgers next time!"}
{"text":"I got the Chicago Dog, seeing I'm from Chicago and grew up on Chicago dogs, I consider myself an expert on them.  The Vienna beef hot dogs are served with some cheap relish, not Chicago's Vienna Beef Relish.  The bun was hard and a dog, small fry, and a small drink was $9.97.  Was pretty bad, and way, way too expensive.  Stick with Higley dogs, they are done right."}
{"text":"Awesome little find in Gilbert! The location is a little hidden if you are coming from Higley, but its a super clean / awesome food little gem! Everything we have tried, has been amazing. Its a good family owned business, and the owner / son truly care about the customers."}
{"text":"Wow...!  Love their dogs!  I try something different every time and they have yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"Perfect little place to grab lunch! For the life of me I couldn't decide what to eat. I felt like I needed to eat a hot dog but instead got a burger. It was great along side my cheese fries. My daughter got a kids meal, chicken nuggets with fries and it did include a drink.   We decided to take it to go since our friends were going to meet us for lunch and some pool time. Got home and to my surprise, my fries was not soggy from the cheese sauce. Love it when that happens because I realized that I forgot to ask for the cheese on the side. My little one who has become one of the pickiest eaters ever even ate a ton of it.   This place is about 5min from our house and one of the biggest reasons I picked it. Now that I know it's fantastic we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great dogs!!!  My daughter loved the waffle cone corn dog!! I had the Gringo Dog. Definitely needed a fork and knife. Very delicious. Service was great and friendly!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Mugsy for the first time last night. Had the best burger ever! My hubby had a hot dog that he loved. We will be going back a lot!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a great hot dog. Love the topping options and the dog options as well. However, the burger was unbelievably delicious. Better than 5 guys. Unreal. Great job and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall is a family favorite! Everything from a Sonoranish hotdog, to a mac and cheese burger to the pink fry sauce! It is all amazing food and the service is 5 star!! We will go again and look forward to trying another Mugsy designed hot dog delight!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I don't really like hot dogs.   Having said that, this was a decent hot dog place. I might come back to try another signature dog.  I had the Rueben dog.  The sauerkraut was a little bland but everything else was good.  I still like Portillo's better, but this place was a solid 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"Every dog here is top notch.  The Burger are just as good if not even better.  We go usually once a week!"}
{"text":"I'm really not impressed. I wanted to like this place as we choose to support Mom and Pop businesses, it is close to our home, and we love burgers and dogs. However, this restaurant really missed the mark.  I got a dog with chili and onions. The chili tasted like it came out of a can. Really disappointing to say the least. I left most of it.  My husband got a burger. He said it was fine in general, but the bun was stale. Seriously?  That ruins the hamburger.  More thought needs to be put into the freshness and quality of the food served. We won't be returning."}
