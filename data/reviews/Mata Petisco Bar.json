{"text":"I really appreciate a restaurant in Toronto that serves Brunch and takes reservations! A rarity. There was no wait, the food was served promptly and very fresh. Delicious!  I'm excited to hear they also have a food truck."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday to do the $50 tasting menu- long story short, I would come back, but not for the tasting menu.  The tasting menu is a great sampler of what they have to offer, but most of us left feeling pretty hungry. The regular menu has decent prices and presumably larger portions. The Mushroom Quinoa Risotto and Spicy Shrimp were my favourite!  Staff are super friendly, and the Brazilian friendship bracelets they give you at the end of the meal (tie and make a wish) are a nice touch! Corkage fee is $20 a bottle."}
{"text":"Very helpful and knowledgable staff, and AMAZING food! Yes the portions are small ... Because it's Brazilian tapas. They are meant to be small shared plates, so if that's not your thing keep it in mind before you plan on going. Honestly I loved my experience here, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really good food and drinks. Awesome home made hot sauce and very good dessert. Sit by the bar for a fuller experience."}
{"text":"At night they're a tapas restaurant, during the day they offer a delicious and plentiful brunch. Portion sizes are great and the food it awesome."}
{"text":"This place is really good if you are hanging out with friends and not looking to eat heavy meals. Price is a little on the high side but def worth it."}
{"text":"AMAZINGGGG!!! I've had tapas a few times before and was never really happy with them. My boyfriend and I were invited by another couple to go to Mata, and I'm soooo happy we went.  The food was out of this world!! I have never had such delicious, fall off the bone ribs in my life. The beef cheek pouting is to die for and the steak was cooked to perfection! It's a small place decorated beautifully, even the bathroom was nice to look at. The front of the building is open to the street, so it was nice and airy. The prices are great too. The bill for two of us was $125 with 18% tip. Included 4 drinks and 4 plates to share (which was the perfect amount) and of course 2 deserts.  The server didn't let us order too much, this way we could have room for the delicious desert.  The panna cotta  was perfect, not too sweet or heavy.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved everything Came here for summerlicious last Saturday at 7. Wasn't busy at all. Lots of room (good big groups too). During this time, got plenty of attention from the servers; did not feel forgotten. Staff were very nice, genuine, and informative   App  Coxinha  (chicken croquettes) - comes with 2 big pieces. nice light batter on the outside, crispy and not greasy at all.  Whiting fish ceviche  - fresh and delicious. Would've loved more of the housemade tortilla chips  Main Chorizo Acebolado with Cassava Fries   sauteed chorizo & cachaca caramelized onions  Cassava GnocchiÂ (vegetarian) wild mushroom, reggiano cheese, truffle oil - this was to die for. Definitely worth coming back for  Dessert  Rabanada (Brazilian French Toast) with nutella sauce - just perfect, not to sweet.  A little bit on the dry side,  but if you mix it with the dessert below,  together makes the perfect dessert  Banana Cream with peanut butter dust - not to sweet and just perfect for my liking.    Note: this place is more tapa style so expect the portion size to be small"}
{"text":"Went to Mata Bar for brunch. The food was absolutely delicious. The cassava fries were insanely good. I had the Beef Cheek Egg Benedict for the main course and found myself wishing the meal won't end. A must try!"}
{"text":"Every single thing we ate or drank here was fantastic. I've been here twice now and would come back in a heartbeat. Tapas style restaurant with a great selection of South American cocktails - including hands down the best caipirinha I've had outside of Brazil. In terms of food, we tried the majority of the menu and loved everything, particularly the coxinhas, the churrasco and pineapple, and the roasted cauliflower dish. Every thing is made with care here by people who truly value not just good food, but good presentation and great service. The staff are so nice, and the restaurant itself has clearly been put together by someone with an eye for design. I loved my experience here, and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with my parents, as Brazilians we were very excited to try the Feijoada (we had tried brazilian food in other restaurants in the city and were utterly disappointed), and I was so very pleasantly surprised! The food is amazing and incredibly well prepared, my mom also ordered a Picanha (steak) and was amazed by how well prepared it was (we brazilians are very particular about how out meat is prepared). Not only was the food amazing but the staff and atmosphere were great as well. Usually brazilian restaurants are loud, but we could enjoy our lunch in an easy and pleasant atmosphere. Our server was attentive and fast, the bartender prepared a mean caipirinha and the kitchen staff was awesome as well. One thing I really liked, as a bartender myself, there's an option in the menu to pay a round of drinks to the kitchen staff, and they were super happy when we did so! Definitely will be back and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Had dinner and absolutely loved the concept! I've been to Brazil and it's amazing to see a place that can create small portions of meals that are very difficult to create and yet in a very authentic way. The staff is so friendly and the ambiance is beautiful and unpretentious. The also keep the menu interesting and very dynamic. I love this place :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Went with friends who highly recommended and weren't disappointed. Had 18 of 20 items on the menu for 6 of us plus dessert and everything was delicious. One of the owners was our server and he was fantastic. Cocktails were also great. Totally recommend. We live far away at Yonge and Lawrence and will be bringing friends back. If you're in the neighbourhood don't hesitate to go."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch on a Saturday. The brunch menu offers a wide range smaller snacks to main courses. Together with the selection of homegrown peppers it made for an excellent stay. The owner is very friendly and supportive. I would come back any time and highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch.  It was a good little place with a very casual look to it.  We ordered the breakfast poutine, the cheese bread, chorizo sandwich & breakfast burger  The portion sizes were good!  The flavors were super!  Service was good.  All in all it was a good brunch.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"We came in for a Saturday brunch, and though the menu wasn't large, everything was wonderful.  Tasty and flavoured just right, the dishes pleased our party of adults and kids alike. We enjoyed the coxinha (chicken croquettes with aioli), smoked pork benedict, picanha acebolada (top sirloin, fried egg, and fantastic cassava fries); and Brazilian French toast (basically a Nutella French toast). All were served with a variety of hot sauces that were very good, and came with careful explanations so that we wouldn't attempt ones that were not suitable for us.  Pricing was about what you'd expect for a mid- to high-priced weekend brunch in Toronto.  Service was friendly and attentive, and the setting was quiet and relaxing on a Saturday afternoon. At the end of the meal, our server even gave us colourful ribbon bracelets and explained the Brazilian tradition of wearing it.  Next time we're in the neighbourhood, we're definitely eating here again!"}
{"text":"Mata is a nice little spot in Parkdale. Specializing in Brazilian fare, Mata has an interesting menu of food and cocktails. I enjoyed my evening there...  ...and then I got the bill. The prices are outrageous for the offering. I ordered feijoada, which was quite tasty but very tiny. I'm talking about ramekin-sized serving for $13. I was expecting a meal, but got, essentially, an appetizer. I also ordered a pisco sour (cocktail). Again, quite tasty, but $12 for a tumbler-sized drink is a rip off. But maybe I'm just not used to the downtown-cocktail-scene.  Yes, the quality is good, but not unavailable at other places. Would I go there again? Certainly not. Maybe I'm a cheapskate--or just don't like getting taken for a ride."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation and came away in agreement - the tapas are excellent! Ceviche, cassava gnocci, steak skewers, seered cauliflower - each superb and, when combined, bliss-causing! Topped off with a robust coffee (sorry, couldn't give in to the guava cheesecake - next time!) and returned home smiling. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Tapas style.  Small portions good for friends sharing several dishes.  Food all tasted great. A bit loud when there was sport game on."}
{"text":"Cool place and atmosphere. However, that's nothing when you consider the food. Best quality Brazilian food, not the usual crap offered by cheap restaurants but Brazilian food prepared by people who knows good food. Great cheese rolls and pastel. Try the chicken hearts, don't be scared by it :-)"}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new Brazilian resto in Toronto, as ex-pat Brazilians here tell me there aren't any good ones in the entire GTA, you have to have home cooking.  After trying Mata, I have to say that the situation has NOT improved...  Mata fits in perfectly with a lot of the Parkdale scene:  stylish hipster hangout with overpriced everything (especially considering the portions)...  But tapas-style Brazilian food?  Is that an oxymoron?  Brazilians like BIG portions!  As another reviewer mentioned feijoada in a ramekin-sized container, I should've known better than to expect value for money, nevermind authentic cuisine.  Reading the brunch menu, there isn't even any meat in the feijoada!  For $15??  Pretentious and presumptuous.  If that's your vegetarian version, drop the price and put some meat in a regular one.  The best feijoada I've had in recent times was at a place called Muqueca, in Cambridge, MA of all places, and while it was more expensive ($22 USD) it was legit in every way--slow cooked with pork, beef, sausage, etc., served as a complete meal with plantain, collards, farofa, etc...  Entering the dining room, the decor is great--hip, with that \"recovered antique/faded dumpster finds\" look that some people find \"homey\" and \"down to earth\".  There's lots of space to move around, not too cluttered with tables slammed into each other--great for being able to hear your date/friends!  On to the food:  I had a classic caipirinha cocktail to start, which came after quite a while and had a decent presentation, with sugar cane \"swizzler\".  In taste, it should be balanced between the cachaca, sugar and lime, but all I could taste was the sugar.  Pity.  Maybe some of their other caipirinha selections are tastier, but I'm not sure I would give them another chance if they mess up the classic!  On to the swordfish ceviche, which was sadly lacking in almost any flavour.  A ceviche should POP in your mouth with citrus, but I couldn't even taste any in this--how how is that possible???  Portion size was okay.  I had grilled salmon with pepper glaze, coriander potato puree, and crispy parsnips...  Again, portion size was smaller, but at this point I was expecting that.  Plating was a bit sloppy, but this isn't fine dining.  The puree, parsnips and glaze were savoury but again lacking in flavour.  As well, somehow the grill cook had overcooked both small pieces of salmon.  Everyone knows grilled salmon should be soft, velvety, pink and warm in the centre.  This salmon was overdone and dry--were it not for the puree and glaze (and the Nicklebrook IPA I'd ordered with the \"main\" to wash it down), it would've been hard to finish.   Luckily the server had presented us with their pickled peppers, which had three degrees of heat.  I liberally used all three to punch up the two dishes I had, which shouldn't have needed to happen--they should've been able to stand on their own.  If I wasn't averse to extra salt, I probably would've asked for that as well...  The best thing about the meal was the dessert, a tasty sorbet with acai and other berries.  Some people don't like the taste of acai, but I do, so this was a pleasant surprise after so little flavour in the preceding plates and cocktail.  It had a very satisfyingly creamy mouth feel, as well.  Service:  We unfortunately had a new server, who admitted that she was new, and made several mistakes.  In the end, a more experienced server came to her rescue and wound up doing a lot of the service.  I wondered to my friends if this was entirely her fault--if a new server isn't up to snuff, the restaurant shouldn't have hired him/her, or should've properly trained him/her to begin with.  I was just glad the vet stepped in to make things better.  In the end, I can't justify giving this place more than 2/5--it probably would've been a 1/5 based on most of the food and price (although drinks were decently priced), but the decor and dessert bumps it up a bit.  Like many other places in Parkdale, Mata looks good but doesn't deliver the goods, hyped up by people who don't know any better.  For me, the Yelp definition of 2 stars, \"Meh, I've experienced better\" fits this place to a T."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, perfect for brunch. The owners were all extremely welcoming and had a passion for the food they cooked (themselves might I add) which is rarely seen around the city. I would encourage everyone to enjoy brunch or dinner there and don't forget to enjoy the peppers they bring out with the meal.... Heavenly"}
{"text":"Delicious South American food. I tried Coxinhas, Picanha and Carne Seca Poutine, and the quality of all dishes was very high. Cashew and passion fruit juice are just amazing too. Great costumer experience too. For sure I am coming back with more friends!  Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food is fantastic and the drinks are even better. Great new addition to the area. Brunch is available Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"I went there to eat the famous \"coxinha\", but there I realized that it was only one of the several delicious foods. The chef Felipe came to our table asking about the food, which was awesome. Thanks Mata! I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Even first impressions of the place with its awesomely designed interior are on point. The lighting, the wall art, the materials making the bar, all are absolutely bang on with the details for this little South American based eatery. As a usable note for future readers: it turns out they actually take reservations, which is advisable as although we just beat the rush, we saw multiple groups being turned away.  On to the menu. Starting with the drinks, as a beer drinker and craft beer fan I was very happy to see them carry 3 different Nicklebrook beers on tap (aka a company I would argue to be one of Ontario's best craft brewers) for a reasonable $6-7 per pint. Food wise, the menu is broken into 3 rows based on serving size, smallest to largest. My only word of caution is that the \"big plates\" aren't actually much bigger. A $16 order of ribs was only 4 individually cut side ribs, with a small dish of plantain chips. A $17 order of scallops is 5 scallops with accompanying garnishes. Part of me was disappointed in this part of the meal, but the food was all really excellent in taste.  As an added bonus, they have their own hot sauces which are made in house and both the mild and medium flavours were delicious (I was a bit scared of trying the hot since the medium was right on the cusp of my spice limits). You can apparently even buy a set of all 3.  In the end it came to $93 after tax pre tip for 1 small, 1 medium, 2 large plates, 2 desserts, and 3 beers. In other words, even though the \"value\" argument could be lost on the bigger plates, the fact of having a nice multi-course meal come in at the price it did seemed absolutely fine and appeases me towards the 5 star rating I'm giving. Throw in friendly and personable service, and this place is a winner."}
{"text":"The food tastes good, but in such small portions and super overpriced. We had cheesebreads and it was nothing like the Brazilian \"pÃ£o de queijo\". The burguer was good as well as the mango mimosas (they were incredible). I wouldn't call this restaurant Brazilian, I had not seen one Brazilian person working there. Anyways, I wasn't hooked!"}
{"text":"I thought the mandioca with linguiÃ§a was pretty good. Not a fan of the carne assada sadly"}
{"text":"While doing some antique shopping on Queen West my friend and I decided we needed a bite to eat to re-fuel.  We saw this place and decided to check it out.  It's a cute place that offers Brazilian food.  The lunch menu is a bit limited but for a person like me that gets overwhelmed by too many choices that was just fine for me.  The servers were all very pleasant and extremely polite - I was impressed.  I ordered the bean soup (forgot the name but it comes in a glass and not a bowl) and the cod croquettes.  My friend ordered the french toast.  My cod were extremely salty....so much so I couldn't finish it.  The soup was ok but a tiny bit bland.  It had black beans in it with some steamed kale and you are given an orange slice to eat afterwards as a palate cleanser.  However my friend raved about her french toast which more looked like croissant toast with some chocolate drizzled on - she licked the plate clean!    They seem to serve traditional Brazilian food here so I am curious to try some of their other offerings (dinner menu)."}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan of this place. Small portions, lack of flavour, hot sauce annoying to get out of bottle and awkward service.  Place didn't have a Brazilian vibe to it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for perfect, go somewhere else. If you're looking for a really fun and unique experience with delicious food served by people who care about what they're doing, come here.   We had so much fun and enjoyed everything. The passion and personal touch is evident everywhere. Toronto needs more places like this."}
{"text":"I generally consider myself pretty in the loop with restaurants around the city, but when a suggestion was made to try Mata Petisco Bar for Winterlicious, I have to admit I had never heard of the joint. The menu was promising, though, so off we went.  It's a small place, but the decor is homey and inviting. We arrived right on time and were promptly shown to a table right at the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen (which was in itself pretty cool). However, our table was literally about an inch away from another table, so when two more people were seated a few minutes later, it was basically like we were sharing a table. And because the dude to my right had a very booming voice, it made conversation with my dining companion difficult and annoying. Not exactly a promising start to the meal.  The less-than-impressive theme continued with my first course, the Caldo Verde Soup (\"Cassava, Chorizo, Collard Greens\"). This just tasted like a fairly run-of-the-mill creamy soup, albeit one with higher-quality ingredients. But there weren't any bold flavors here; everything just kind of blended together. It was bland, for lack of a better word. I enjoyed eating it, but it didn't knock me out by any stretch of the imagination.  The main didn't fare much better, honestly. I got the Fried Rice (\"Salted Beef, Smoked Meats\") and indeed, it was a small bowl of fried rice. It was fine; the meat was tasty and the rice was cooked perfectly. But again, there were no standout flavors in the dish and it ultimately tasted like something that should've been accompanying something else.  The restaurant finally did knock one out of the park with the dessert, the Guava & Cheese Empanadas with Cinnamon. It was incredible. Hot, fresh, and - surprise, surprise - flavorful, the empanada was exactly the delicious dessert I was hoping for after reading its description. It could've used something like cream or ice cream on the side to cut its richness, but otherwise it was a perfect end to a somewhat mediocre meal."}
{"text":"I went to Mata last weekend and was so happy to have found this place! I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, therefore I am very acquainted with South American street food, and I'll tell you: they nail it!   We had cheese bread, which is a traditional dish from Minas Gerais, and was absolutely perfect, caipirinhas  - if you never had them, Mata is the place to get you started! - plus an assortment of petiscos. I loved the ceviche and the salmon tartare!   It's not cheap, but it's guaranteed excellent food and awesome service. We were served by Felipe, who is the owner, and he treated us like we were best friends - and no, we had never met before. Makes a guest feel special, you know?   Will certainly come back - very soon. I loved it."}
{"text":"Hands down, must try this place! My supper club, which consists of 6 people, tried every dish on the menu. Everything was fantastic! The ambiance is very relaxed and we sat under a screen that was playing Vice episodes from YouTube. And not to ignore the cocktails, the capriniah is a must try. I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Really delicious food! A bit on the expensive side, but worth it. Our server was SO nice and helpful. In fact, all the staff was great. It was a romantic \"date night.\"   I loved the touch of the 'wish bracelets' given at the end of the meal, but I pulled mine off a few days later."}
{"text":"Awesome food !!! Especially for people who are gluten free  we had the cauliflower (sooooo goood), calamari(amazeballs), ceviche (awesome), wings (perfect smoky flavour) and the gnocchi (pretty good). Panna cotta and plantain dessert were spectacular! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I guess I should update my review because the restaurant has \"apologized.\" I don't really see their message as positive, but maybe I am reading into it. So I will give them the benefit of the doubt and take it as positive and kind gesture.   Since posting my review I have received the following message:   From Mata Petisco Bar Thursday, July 30, 2015 - 09:42 AM   Hi Itanni, sorry to hear that you didnt enjoy your experiencs at Mata. We were warned by some friends of your review on Yelp, Bookenda and your blog. Yesterday a food writer contacted us saying that he posted a coment on your blog. We tried to find but looks like it wasnt published. We unsderstand the \"beer situation\" you mentioned. One more time, sorry for your experience.  From me:  Warned? Yes, I reviewed \"my experience.\" Unfortunately I did not have a good experience, and I shared my perspective. That said, these review sites will show you the statistics on my reviews and that I give very few negative reviews. I do not attack restaurants - only share my personal experience - which is the point. As for the \"food writer\" that messaged me - well, I don't address messages that attack me personally. I have NEVER attacked another person. These responses reinforce my experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and genuinely friendly service.  Had the Mahi Mahi Ceviche, Cod Escondidinho, and Smoked Pork Poutine.  All were excellent and good for sharing.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I was invited by my wife's gfs to enjoy this place, i was told it would be a Brazilian restaurant. I thought it would be something traditional, to which I wasn't expecting much.  When we got to there, the environment got us on the first, cozy and great staff, all owners of this little boutique restaurant, they explain every detail you ask, it shows they care for their reputation and experience for the customer. You feel the Brazilian culture, but something more is there...  The food is a fusion of brazilian traditional food, some other latin favorites, all with a special touch. We tried the beef chick poutine, with fried casaba. After we went for the lomito sandwich, that was unexpected, and delicious, imagine pork, with guava bbq, avocado sauce, on a potato bread, and on the side plantain chips! You might think where are the traditional Brazilian choices? They have feijoada, cheese bread, pasteis and others, but we're glad we went on the other side of the menu.  Options of beer and wines, i went for the beers, which are no traditional brands, but good drafts.  The downside would will be a bit pricy for the portions, but add the flavour and ambient, and the place is totally worthy. Opinion of a Brazilian that enjoys food with unique taste!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place!  From the house made sauces and accompaniment s to the quiet lively background music, this place sets a cozy feel with fresh vibrant thought filled flavors.  The Staff is friendly and helpful and add to the experience and the wish bracelets just add the cherry.  Highly recommend stopping in and trying the swordfish ceviche and the bacalau!"}
{"text":"I recently tried this place. Not only was the food amazing but so was the service. Tried the tuna, the ceviche and the octopus. All amazing dishes and my favourite one was the tuna"}
{"text":"We partook in the Winterlicious menu which was delicious. I had the Cheese Bread (Pao De Queijo), the Quinoa Risotto and the seasonal (passion fruit) panacotta. All delicious. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable & helped guide our vegetarian palettes with a wink."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem of a place while visiting Toronto. Excellent tapas! My friends and I loved everything we had. We had the Picanha Acebolada, Beef Kibe, Brazilian Mac Sliders, Cheese Bread, Coxinha and Coalho Cheese Skewer. The favorites were definitely the sliders and the cheese bread for the table. My personal favorite were the cassava frites served with the Picanha. Also, great customer service made the experience all the better."}
{"text":"I was so bummed that I couldn't make it to the Media event to Mata Bar (@MataBarTO) back in July last year and couldn't find time to go until recently. Largely influence by South American flavors and the concept of shared plates, I was super excited to finally try them.  Love how the change the place by just adding to the basic of the previous Keriwa CafÃ© (compare to here) just by changing the color of the bar and light fixtures. Love the old crates used as the bar shelves, love it with the lighting.   We decided to go ahead with their 8 course tasting menu plus a Caipirinha cocktail at $45pp, but there wasn't a menu for it and the chef will serve you what he felt like (on and off menu).  Caipirinha ~ Cachaca, Lime, Simple Syrup, Sugar Cane ~ We got the classic lime and passion fruit flavors, I usually like anything passion fruit flavor but this was obviously not the real fruit so it was rather sweet and we both prefer the classic lime version a lot better. ~ Also love how it came with an actual piece of sugar cane that you get to chew on.  Cheese Bread (Pao De Queijo) ~ Requejao Cheese Sauce ~ Love Brazilian cheese bread, I can probably munch on this all day long.  Croquettes ~ Cumari Pepper Aioli   Ceviche ~ Crispy Leeks, Sweet Corn, Taro Chips  House Green Salad ~ Pomegranate, Coalho Cheese, Molasses ~ Love the freid cheese, the pomegranate and even the dressing but wish there was a little bit less of it since it was a tad too sweet but love the use of molasses here which goes so well with the cheese.  Espumante Coconut Caiparinha $12  ~ Cachaca, Egg White, Coconut Water, Simple Syrup, Lime, Muddled Malaguetta Pepper, Toasted Coconut Flakes ~ This was the only item we added to the tasting menu, this is a fancier version of our first cocktail and love every part of it. Love the texture and flavor from the added toasted coconuts and the spice from the Malaguetta pepper was just the perfect balance.  Tapioca Cubes ~ Love love love love this, I can much on these everyday. I have a love for grilled/fried rice (like the Yakionigiri here) and this one was even better with it's chewy texture which was almost like a fried mochi.  Beef Pastel ~ Love the flakiness of the pastry and it was perfect with the hot sauces  Quinoa Risotto ~ Wild Mushrooms, White Truffle Oil ~ OMG, this is probably the dish that everyone keeps talking about after eating here and it was amazing given that there's not even cream in it.  ~ Love the intense mushroom flavors and the creamy \"no-cream\" goodness. Being a big fan of quinoa and mushroom, I couldn't have ask for more and this dish definitely made my day.  Picanha Sliders ~ Malagueta Aioli, Catupiry Cheese, Caramelized Onion ~ Thought the beef was slightly too well done for my taste but the aioli, onion and cheese made up for everything. ~ By now, we were really full and was glad that it was a slider so that we have room for dessert,.  Tapioca CrÃ¨me Caramel ~ The Tapioca Creme Caramel was so good with the shredded coconut on top.  Avocado CrÃ¨me BrulÃ©e ~ While I was excited about the avocado creme brulÃ©e, it was a bit weird tasting to me. ~ There was too much lemon in the avocado which didn't really go well with the sweet caramel top crust, but that's really my personal opinion.  Cumari, Bode and Malgueta Hot Sauces ~ Love the first 2 a lot, spicy goodness that goes with most of their dishes.  Verdict : ~ Love everything we had and would love to go back to try the rest of the menu, maybe for brunch too. ~ The decor and service is just as amazing. ~ If you haven't been, I highly recommend you to try the tasting menu which is an amazing deal  .http://kikisbff.blogspot.ca/2015/03/mata-bar-south-american.html"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a brunch spot with a South American twist, be sure to check Bar Mata out. They offer a variety of South American inspired tapas, with a focus on plates that are meant to be shared (petisco-style). The chefs bring a creative touch to traditional ingredients, incorporating the best from their Brazilian roots and expertise in Portuguese and Spanish Restaurants. Each dish was so full of flavor; you can taste the story behind each and every one of them.  You may have also seen their food truck Made In Brazil roaming around at various festivals and events happening across the city. Long story short, the guys won a fully equipped Food Truck from Food Network Canada's Food Truck Face Off, and the rest was history."}
