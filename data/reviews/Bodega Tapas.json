I just wanted to write to say that I went to this restaurant on Friday August 2, 2013, but it burnt down :(  Doesn't look like the process of rebuilding has started in any way."}

Bodega Tapas and Martini Bar is a Great entertaining Restaurant for whatever vibe you're up for and can accommodate big parties too.

   This Restaurant just opened up about a month now and the owner Karyne's vision came to life and welcomes you to enjoy yourself and relax when spending a meal here.
       As soon as you walk in is the Hostess stand with a Huge Glass custom wine Cellar that's just art to look at. On the right is the Open Kitchen and leads to the Indoor dining Area with a beautiful highly reflective white laminate ceiling , you can see the outdoor Terrace where it overlooks the Trendy rue Principal on the ceiling too (see pics)!
         I sat with my sister on the outdoor Terrace on the left passed the Bar that's nicely light-up. The Terrace overlooks the parking lot but has a lot of foliage that makes it quite secluded and has speakers that play nice music to chill to, there are also Tiki torches at night. 

    The drinks are good I got to try 4 martinis between my sister and I it was heavenly. My first Martini was the Love Potion (tasted like sex on the beach), and a Pomegranate one after that. My sister enjoyed a Blue one and  a Mandarin Martini afterwords.
       The cute Busboy was great brought out water and refilled our glasses throughout the night (the water is good here) and fresh cut Baguette and butter.
 Between the two of us we couldn't decide what to order so the server suggested the Chef's Selection, and it turned out to be a Great suggestion.

     The Server came out with a tray with a huge plate containing tiny dishes that fit on the plate like a jigsaw puzzle containing little presentations of food she explained to us what each dish was.
 
        There were Scallops, Duck in a Brandy Sauce, Venison in a filo pastry with Feta and spinach, a Crab cake, General Tso's Chicken, Shitake Mushroom crusted Brie cheese that was in a Port caramel reduction sauce.  I really enjoyed the Duck it was Amazing and the Venison stood out for me very delicate and lightly spicy. The Crab cake was good too regardless that it was Imitation Crab- or Pollack it still was super yummy. The Brie Cheese It is soo good you have no idea! But I mean how can you go wrong? Its Cheese!
       
   We had a great time and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their wine and time, I can really see this place for a Bachelor Party or Bridal Shower it has great decor, class, and fun food to make any party amazing. 

  I will be back and cant wait to try the Bison Burger Sliders and some of that wine!"}
{"text":"I very rarely give restaurants 5 stars on Yelp. 
This is a rare exception.
It's a gem of a restaurant hidden in St. Sauveur. 
On the main Principale street, where restaurants are a dime a dozen, this tapas style stands out on every front.
1) Atmosphere - modern, upscale yet relaxed, glass wine cooler, private rooms, interesting decor, it's everything you want from a bar or if you prefer more formal private seating, you have that too.
2) Service - Very generous owner Karine and server extraordinaire Tabatha make your experience one to remember. You really feel like a regular from the minute you walk in. I can't express how amazing the staff are
3) Menu -  Very interesting tapas dishes. You have a little bit of everything which makes it perfect for large groups or families. 
4) Food - talk about value and flavour. This really was a five star restaurant at extremely reasonable prices. Roughly $25- 35 per head, yet you get food that feels like it should have been $80. I especially enjoyed the chef's surprise tasting menu, the warm goat cheese/mushroom salad, the french onion soup, the veal tacos...i could really go on - coming to think of it, there was not a single thing i didn't enjoy except for maybe the tuna tataki (which was good, just wasn't as amazing as the other dishes). 

My friends and I enjoyed ourselves so much, we went twice in one weekend on a trip to St. Sauveur. 
I can't wait to go back and have that experience again."}
