{"text":"Way to expensive. Plus now their Wood fire pizza oven is broken and they are serving SLICES of pizza instead of personal pizzas. The Employees of State Farm deserve better than this expensive crap they serve.   Eurest is NOT the company anyone wants to cook for them. They are slow, expensive, and just plain don't give a crap about the people cooking or eating their food. Not to mention they have probably the WORST hours here imaginable. A lot of employees here work until AT LEAST 7pm, they are sure missing out on a lot of money. I hope that everyone stops eating here and makes them change their game plan or close down."}
{"text":"Open to the public, this is a hidden gem of Tempe. The view of the lake is beautiful, it's affordable, and the wide variety of food is satisfying and delicious. Easy, free parking is available in the garages or on the street in front. Don't expect gourmet fare, but go for solid comfort food and great views at a good price -- a winning combo in my book!"}
{"text":"This place is just plain nasty and overpriced.  It is basically a cafeteria for the State Farm offices in Marina Heights but technically i think the public could go in there.  Don't."}
{"text":"They have raised their already high prices again. Today I got 3 chicken strips and what would be the equivalent of a fry from in and out and spent 10 dollars. The 3 chicken strips were 6 dollars and the frys were 3.50. They need to lower their prices if they are going to give such little amount of food. Several of the employees have complained about the prices that I spoke to also but they blame it on the expensive rent they have to pay and say that is why the food is so expensive. I will not be going there anymore and will not recommend anyone to go there either. The food is not worth the price, plenty of other places near by."}
{"text":"Café located at the Marina Heights buildings on the State Farm Campus. This is open to everyone not just State Farm employees. I believe that it is a Eurest Cafes company but it is steps up from their typical corporate café options. This location has a large variety of options to satisfy any cuisine you are craving. From a sandwich bar to Tacos to even Pho (Vietnamese) soup. They even have brick oven style pizzas. I enjoyed the variety of options especially when convince of being close to work however it was a little pricey.  As far as the food, the tacos were fresh and loaded with fresh toppings and I liked that the staff embraced the culture and even wore sombreros. My friend enjoyed the food from the butcher block area where you can get sliced meat with sides which also looked delicious.   Keep in mind the typical lunch hour crowd is noon and they do offer an ordering area at the front doors. Lines do form at the various station areas so pay attention to your line and help get your food quickly. There are items that you can quickly grab and go incase you can't spend the time waiting. I am excited to try out the other items and read other reviews about this place.  Seating is great, indoor and outdoor. You don't need to order from the café to enjoy their outdoor seating either."}
{"text":"The only reason to eat here is because you have no other choice.   Employees are indifferent with no sense of urgency.   They only acknowledge you if forced and it is glaringly apparent that they do not value their customers or their time.   The place is clean and the food is fair by nothing to cross the street for.   View is nice."}
{"text":"My food was not warm nor tasted good after I heated it up. Way too expensive for the quality. Are you able to put emojis on Yelp? If so, I'd like to insert a trashcan emoji here"}
{"text":"Recent changes led to the removal of the daily option of a protein (5-6 oz roasted chicken or turkey) plus two delicious sides (ie, qinuoa, asperagus, sweet potatoe) for $7.99. I use to eat this daily but now this option is removed with nothing comparable in quality and healthiness. I've come by a few times and nothing has interested me in their selection as it's mostly fried food and complex carbs. Today I decided to give it another try and purchased an Asian bowl for $7.99. It came with a scoop of white rice, about 2oz of chicken and small amounts of fresh veggies. A pretty small portion for the price. I gave this feedback in person to a few of the staff, but they just shrugged it off. I'm hopeful the owner will see this and consider the feedback because I would love to frequent this place again since it's a convenient location."}
{"text":"This place tends to be a bit or a miss. They do have a decent variety of food, but their portions are pretty poor compared to the price you pay. My go to is their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Other than that, there isn't anything special this place offers.  Just a heads up, it can be pretty busy since it is located in the Marina Heights/State Farm campus, so it can get really busy at times.   One last thing, the system they use for ordering can be faulty at times, so be sure to check with the grill cook to make sure your order comes through."}
