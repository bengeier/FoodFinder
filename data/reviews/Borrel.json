{"text":"Ok I'm not a regular reviewer but I have to write something about this. First the good things- nice atmosphere great drinks and comfortable to share a drink with friends. 
Now bad ones. What's the wrong with the food here. I had veggie balls, this comes from someone who loves all things kale, tasted like what- did you do to make it taste this bad.
The pulled beef sandwich looks bad and also tastes bad. I was very hungry or I wouldn't have eaten it. It came with 6 chips came from a bag of photo chips. 
Why??  I had better looking food at McDonald's"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the Netherlands and Borrel looked too cute and too European for me to resist. 

I came here with 2 other friends on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was completely full. This restaurant is in a 'house'? Their space is VERY limited. The restaurant opened at 2 and we got there at 2:30. When we walked in, EVERY SINGLE PATRON stared at my friends and I because that is how TINY this restaurant is. 

We ended up waiting for about 1 hour plus before sitting down. The service was a little bit weird. A family came in after us, and they sat down before us.. and we had to wait another 20 minutes for another group to leave... I don't know how my friends and I were so patient to keep waiting. Probably because we were really looking forward to Dutch food. 

Aside from the questionable service, the food was delicious! I ordered the Maatjesharing (raw herring) and shared it with my friends and it was really good. The herring paired with the onions and pickles was DELICIOUS. I also ordered the Erwtensoep (a.k.a. \"Snert\", pea soup with ham) for myself and that was really good too. The pea soup was ultra thick and you can taste some tendrils along with the soup. It had a really interesting texture. (Sounds strange, but it was good). My friends ordered the Boerenkool (stewed kale and potato mash served with Dutch smoked sausage, bacon lardons and gravy) and the Frikandel Speciaal (A deep-fried beef, pork and chicken sausage). They said the Boerenkool didn't taste any extra ordinary (yes, two words), but the friend who ordered the deep fried hotdog REALLY liked it. 

My comfort zone of Toronto is from Bathurst to Church and from Bloor and Front. I always love trying new restaurants outside of this block of comfort. Borrel is delicious and fun, especially if you want to get away from the craziness of the downtown core and have a little taste of Europe. 

TLDR; Good snack bar, but very tight seating. I'd recommend coming during non-peak hours and trying the Erwtensoep, the Maatjesharing, and the Frikandel Speciaal."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out thus restaurant was opening.  Ever since going to Amsterdam a few years ago, I've been missing the Dutch raw herring that was so widely available.  I have not been able to find a suitable alternative in Toronto until this restaurant came along!!  

Borrell is a small restaurant on the Danforth and was packed when we went on a Saturday evening.  Service was prompt, herring was awesome, beer selection was good!  Only downside (or upside, however you look at it) is they only prepare about 10 orders off herring a day.  The fish must be fresh so they are not able to prepare too many of it!  They don't have a big menu, but food was pretty good!

To end, good service, great food!"}
{"text":"Amy Pataki, the food critic from The Toronto Star wrote a positive review on this restaurant a couple of weeks back.  She seemed to really enjoy the \" Hachee Shepherd's Pie \".  I ordered it and thought that it was a reasonable price at $10.00  When the dish came out, I could only stare at it in disbelief.  The quaint dutch bowl it came in could not have been 4\" in diameter and less than 2\" tall.  The potato layer was about 1/2\"  thick.  All together, had I eaten it the way a man would eat a meal, it would have been 5 bites maximum.  Really?!?!
The dish was ok, but REALLY?!?!  This was not from the appetizer menu, this was a main dish.  Exactly what size person was this portion supposed to satisfy?  I look at value for my money.  If this had been in some fancy restaurant, I might understand.  This restaurant is in a house which is far enough away from the main part of The Danforth that a restaurant goer could think that they would be getting greater bang for their buck.  Just not the case.  

Also, while I was there, a Dutch lady came in and sat herself beside a gentleman that was having a soup. We were the only 3 people in the restaurant at this time. The owner came out and started conversing with this lady, somewhat loudly in Dutch for several minutes.  I could see that the gentleman was uncomfortable with this, but did not say anything.  He finished up his soup, paid for it, and was out like a flash. Dont think he will ever be coming back and neither will I."}
{"text":"another place i really wanted to like seeing i'm half dutch. 

as soon as i heard there was a dutch restaurant in my own neighbourhood i planned my visit. given my food restrictions i realized most dutch food like my beloved croquets would be a no go situation so i studied the menu and made a plan.

i started with the herring. a massive letdown. two scrawny 5-6 inch filets an inch or so wide cut into 5-6 pieces each of dryish looking, anemic herring. my bad for being the first diner of the night at 5:00 pm this past thursday as i seemed to have gotten wednesday night's leftover. the kitchen should be ashamed.

along with this 'bounty' were 3 nickel sized bread and butter pickle slices and some diced onions. the onions came cradled in a spoon. a spoon so small that my first thought was that i have seen coke spoons in the movies that were bigger. i kid you not. i had to parcel out the 'sides' to make them last with each bite. i mean really cutting a nickel sized pickle into quarters!!!

then the soup, a split pea and ham, as traditional as it goes minus the black bread on the side for me, was also a let down. bland. tepid. and a mouth feel i didn't care for. shredded meat along with sausage rounds was odd and sadly near tasteless. i wished there were salt and pepper at the table which oddly there weren't and i was too chuffed to ask.

the other dish was a plate of mixed cold meats. nothing outstanding to it at all and the tartare was bizarre.

lastly the coffee. please people when someone asks for some more coffee after having finished a cup warn them you don't give refills and its another $4 for a cup. a bitter surprise after a bland meal even though the coffee was the best part of it."}
{"text":"I have had an amazing love affair with Dutch food for many years now. I have even made two trips to The Netherlands because of this. So when I found out the Borrel had a physical location I had to go and see it for my self. 

I have been a big fan of Borrel, following them on social media to see where they would go next. Now that they have their own physical location I of course went. This location small but cozy, the service is very friendly, and what brings me back every time is the pofferjes! I don't know what it is about these dessert but is has a spell on me. 

This is my first visit here, I am happy and satisfied with the food and service. I will be back in the near future and hopefully many, many more times."}
{"text":"Nice quaint feel. Has identity crisis going or doez it want to be a pub or restaurant. Food not great. Everything deep fried and over cooked. Very loud music for 630pm"}
