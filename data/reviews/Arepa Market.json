{"text":"This place is so cool. I grabbed a chicken and chipotle empandad from the first stall, at 3.50, it was a steal. It was very tasty and filling. I walked around in the market and looked at the arepas and the cheviche and I wish I had more room in my stomach. I have never had an arepa but I was too full to sample one after the empanada.

I hope this place lasts so I can eat more on my next visit. I wish we had something like this in Detroit."}
{"text":"Located inside El Gordo fine foods - Arepa Market is the second vendor to your left (or the first vendor on your left after you climb the mini flight of stairs to the elevated part of this communal space).  There are 5 vendors all under one roof so it can be a little bit confusing.

Came here with William T. to sample some Latin food and sample we did.  We got #10, the Pabellon, which is made with shredded flank steak, Fresco cheese, beans and plantains.  The flank steak was quite savoury, although I found it to be a bit dry.  The plantain was definitely THE memorable ingredient that made me choose the Pabellon over all others.  For $7, this baby will satisfy both your belly and your wallet.  I will definitely be back to try others.

There is a makeshift eating area towards the rear, but be warned... it is not shaded, and on a hot day like Sunday... brought on some extra heat!"}
{"text":"Arepa Market is the 2nd last vendor on the left side as you approach the rear of the store.

 Arepas are a Venezuelan snack wrapped in corn meal bread. They loosely resemble in form a Shawarma.  There are 11 options to choose from. I had #10, the Pabellon which contains shredded flank steak, Fresco cheese, beans & plantains. The flank steak was very flavorful but could have been a bit more juicy, but for $7 this is the optimum lunch time snack that will leave you feeling very satisfied in palette & in gut.

 If you find yourself around Kensington Market stop by Arepa Market for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is more of a little stand inside El Gordo fine foods, but it deserves to be it's own restaurant as far as I'm concerned.

This place servers Venezuelan \"fast food\".  These little sandwhich/pita sized, pizza pocket typed things on really fresh and moist cornbread.  I had the chicken and avocado item.  The avocado was fresh and not showing any signs of bruising and pretty much melt in my mouth. The chicken was full of pieces of tender and juicy breast meat.

There are so many little knick knacks to try here so I will certainly be back sometime."}
{"text":"Slightly confusing to locate but well worth the effort. Located at 214 Augusta, Arepa Market is inside the Pancho's Bakery building. Head to the back and Arepa Market is the first food stall on the left-hand side. (I originally posted my review under Agave, which is actually the second stall)

I had #7 on the menu which was a \"Venezuelan\" arepa for $6. Note that tax is already included and I was offered a free drink (he said all orders come with a free bevvie). Most things are $5 here and a few are $6. You have the options of paying $2 extra and adding a side dish to your arepa. The portion wasn't huge but it was certainly adequate for lunch.

An arepa is a popular South American snack/sandwich. The actual arepa bread is about the size of an english muffin but it is made with corn flour. The Venezuelan #7 I had came with pulled pork meat, black beans, fried plantain slices, some kind of crumbled white cheese and avocado. It was absolutely delicious but very messy to eat (I was given a fork).

Owner dude was very pleasant and friendly.

No seating at this place but there is a small bar at the front where you can stand an eat. Better yet is to take it outside to eat while you browse the market."}
