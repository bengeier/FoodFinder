{"text":"My first time & I didn't like it. Worst chicken taco ever, and refried beans had a really nasty taste. Plus you pay a lot for a meal & it is the size of a kids meal. (Very small taco, scoop of beans, scoop of rice). Will not go again, Mattas has my business for Mexican meals!"}
{"text":"Huge let down compared to the original from Rancho de Tia Rosa's. The live performer, the blank walls and tables completely killed the old energy and feel from the previous restaurant, it was washed down. I ordered the plate that seemed closest to what I always ordered from the last place; salmon enchiladas with rice and beans. I honestly felt like it was a frozen dinner warmed up in the oven, and super over priced for me and my fiance. Altogether it was close to $50 for two meals, an extra side of rice, and horchatas. Immediately called my parents to warn them to not visit, as it is nowhere near Rancho de Tia Rosa's ( which I came to find out they are relocated in Gilbert...but closed again ) I tried, but no further chances."}
{"text":"Good food, but no rancho de tia rosa. Miss the old place in Gilbert, wish I was still around. The new place more room but okay for fast lunch."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley. There are others close by that were not as good.  Definitely go to this place.  You can taste the quality."}
{"text":"Unfortunately our food came out cold and they didn't have time to fix it I guess. There are some good options for their food but nothing really seemed appetizing to begin with."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of food you get. Salsa Cabana in the same complex has better food for a fair price. The decor is better at Tia Rosas but not worth their prices."}
{"text":"As most people mentioned everything is a la carte and is overpriced. But the food is better than average. My only other complaint is that the tables are too close together."}
{"text":"Way to crowded and noisy for me.  Somewhat over decorated, too.  

I had a chicken salad and because there were tiny bones in the chicken meat I did not enjoy it.  I would of had them take it back however we seldom saw our waiter or anyone else to help us.  We had to ask for our eating utensils.  I will think twice about going back to Tia Rosa's.   

The others in our party were happy with their meals and there certainly was a generous portion of everything.  That's the positive side of the place."}
{"text":"No Bueno. 

We tried this location as it is closer to our house. We walked in at 8:30 and the girl at the counter immediately said \"we close in 30 minutes!\".  I told her, \"yes, that's why we are here at 8:30\".  

We ordered two tortilla soups, a flying saucer and chips and salsa.  The salsa was served in the smallest condiment plastic to go cups possible. Although you order at the counter, I would never expect at a restaurant that you have the options to \"dine in\", to be served tortilla soup in a styrophome cup!!!!!!  My daughter ordered a flying saucer and she was served on a plate. This really bothered me.   

Food was ok, but I can't handle feeling like I'm picnicking when we are dining out. We'll opt for Gecko Grill or the original Tia Rosas next time. I would MAYBE go back for take out only."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try it after the name change but let me tell you guys something everything is the exact same maybe even better! the food is still great and the people are still great! Boca taqueria is AMAZING!!! Go there on a Saturday night the vibe is the best!"}
{"text":"The service and the environment is great, but I've definitely had better Mexican food. If you're a gringo and don't mind Americanized Mexican food, then this is the place for you. I've gone here a couple of times getting different thing, and was never impressed. The atmosphere is the best part of this place and it's great for large family gatherings, but the food is just ok."}
{"text":"Bad service!  My 3rd time at this location, I want to like the place. Always have to wait, the food is not as good as Mesa Drive location (the original) Rosa's!  McKellips location is better in service and the food is better.  I will not be going back to Higley and Guadalupe Tia Rosa again"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Salmon tacos are amazing as are their cheese enchiladas with green sauce. My daughters moved away and insist we come here every time they visit. Great staff especially Ashley!!!"}
{"text":"Best Shrimp Taco's in town. Anything beef is excellent. Their beef is slow cooked in a special recipe and has been amazing for the 20 years we have been eating it. Their recipes are from The Original Rancho de Tia Rosa restaurant in Mesa. Their chicken tortilla soup is very good too."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place ever! Salsa is amazing. Everything is amazing. This is the original Tia Rosas. Seriously everything is great."}
{"text":"Love the food, never disappoints. Just wish that they had chosen a location with more seating. The place is usually packed whenever I go, seating can be hard to find. And the seating they have is awkward. But I'll keep coming back for the food!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during a break from work. The place was very busy, but there was no line to order so I ordered quickly, a green chili pork burrito. It was seven dollars and change, so I paid and took my number. The inside was full so I went out on the patio, which was shaded so it wasn't too hot. No misters though, so it was warm. 
My food came out very quickly, in about five minutes or so. When the server put it down I realized it was my job to go grab silverware and napkins s from inside. 
I grabbed the silverware and started eating. The green chili pork was very good, but the tortilla did not seem like it had been heated before being used, it had kind of a stiff feeling like it was straight out of the package. There was some lettuce garnish, but nothing else came with the burrito.
Left with a so so feeling, not great but not horrible."}
{"text":"This is the best food I've ever had, their salmon and their shrimp is outta this world. I go here all of the time and one of the girls knows my order and always gets the food out quick.  The pricing is fair, and the quality is great. The staff is very nice and helpful it's so clean inside, they immediately clean the tables after you're done eating. It's a very popular lunch and dinner place so if you want a nice quiet evening this isn't the place for that, it's loins and happy not dull and quit. I tell everyone to go to this new location since it's the original and not the knockoff. The green salsa is THE BEST! I HIGHLY recommend to eat here, you'll get addicted."}
{"text":"This place is really great for a meet-up or family gatherings, along with a quick lunch or dinner. You come in, order, and then they bring your food out to you based on your number. You pick up your own silverware and fill up your drink. So don't come here expecting people to wait on you, and then get disappointed because they aren't. It's expected that you go up and ask them for what you need. So don't discredit the restaurant for something it's not. The food itself is pretty good. My favorite foods right now are between chicken and beef tacos. I don't find them bland at all. The meat is seasoned wonderfully, and the lettuce and tomatoes are fresh and add a great flavor! The salsa and guacamole is also very delicious. I do think they are a little overpriced. However, that's what taco Tuesday is for!! I always get 2 or 3 on Tuesdays, because they are under $2. Additionally, they have special deals for different foods each day between 2-4. They always give you extra salsa and limes for free, and sometimes they'll give you chips for free. Usually you have to pay for them, though. My only complaint is that during their rush hours, they could have better service. The last time I went, it was chaotic and I had to wait an absurd amount of time for 4 tacos. It was worth it, though! They were juicy and flavorful. And their meals do not skimp. They give generous amounts of beans and rice, and the entrée is generally enough to fill you up. For me it is, at least. Overall, if you want something delicious and filling, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant since it opened at university and Mesa drive over 25 yrs ago under the name Rosa's. there's been a lot of buying and selling of this business and name going on, so to end the confusion, apparently the original Rosa's has changed their name to Boca taqueria. I rarely give 5 stars to my reviews, but this food is special. I come for the 2-5 happy hour specials 1-2 x a week. There refried beans are great as is their marinated pork. Never had a bad meal. It is not a \"out to dinner\" restaurant environment. More like a neighborhood cafe vibe. Definitely worth a try for you. Tip... the standard salsa is not great. Too sweet and no bite. Ask them to give you their hotter salsa instead. I mix the 2 together for a nice salsa."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!  Original Tia Rosa owners so you know it's the real deal!  I recommend the chicken mole enchilada. Slightly sweet but full of flavor."}
{"text":"Terrible.
Tiny burritos at huge prices. No flavoring. They also forgot our order and we had to inquire as to the status. Really, the only positive experience was using the clean restroom.
I ate three burritos and my lady friend had two. No hot sauce.

Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best salmon tacos in the history of fish tacos!!!  Sounds like an exaggeration, but it is really amazing!  The chicken taco very very moist and good, atmosphere and music was nice."}
{"text":"If I would have known this was TIA ROSAS reincarnate I would have never tried this restaurant.  The food was so \"Gringo\" or pseudo-Mexican.  All the salsas were made with way too much sugar and had very little spice to them.  I ordered the chile relleno which by itself wasn't half bad. A stuffed Pablano pepper that was roasted and topped with a nice white cheese. The thing that ruined it was the red sauce that it was placed on.  It reminded me of a sweet marinara sauce that would have been better served with pasta. Thank goodness Phoenix has some of the best Mexican Restaurants unfortunately this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Tia Rosas and I was thrilled when they opened another shop close by. I love their food and it's certainly 5 star worthy. However I felt the need to drop a few stars because  A) the guy you have serving food is a jerk and B)  I always get the same thing every time and have the last 4 times I've been in. Suddenly today I am charged $1.50 more?? I checked my receipt and it was right but a $1.50 price increase literally overnight?? And $1.99 for a basket of chips is ridiculous. I will still come but probably not as often now. Now I don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Over priced! Decent food but you get very little for what you pay! We all know rice and beans are cheap. And a real Mexican food restaurant should offer decent salsa. I need more cilantro and jalapeño! I don't mind spending money for some good carne asada tacos, margaritas, and chips and salsa! I had high hopes for a good place close to home. Very disappointed! (Though the carne asada itself was tasty!)"}
{"text":"Food is just awful. Seating was pretty cramped. The service was good until they had to issue a refund. The worker doing the refund took the plate from my hand and angrily threw the food in the trash. Would never recommend this place or come here again. There's a far better Mexican restaurant (salsa cabana( in the same plaza that will never disappoint in food or service."}
{"text":"The food is good but not worth the wait.  My family and I have eaten here twice and both times the food has taken extremely long to come out. The first time we ate at the restaurant for lunch and it took approximately 15 minutes for the food to be at the table. This is longer for a Taqueria I feel. When this place used to be Rosas the food never took this long. The second time my family and I ate here we called the order in ahead of time to save some time. It took over 35 minutes to make the food we still waited in the car for over 20 minutes. They told us the food would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes and double that and our food was finally here. Not worth the wait there are better Taqueria's around"}
{"text":"It's back!  A decent place for sure, but certainly a few long standing quirks, that to me, make it 3 starts (average) over something that I would consider above average or exceptional.  Overall the food is good and despite some of the negative reviews of the staff, I find them to be friendly.  We go about 1-2 times a month, but for one reason or another not as much as before since the move.

The quirks I find are ones that most people that join us all agree with as well.  Portions are a bit small for the prices and no \"free\" chips.  The other is the small plastic salsas that they will give out for free but are clearly protecting from waste so you find yourself having to get up from your meal to ask for time and time again.

So with the quirks, how would I change this... First I would focus on making the portions about 1/4-1/3 bigger or add a small, but cheap side (beans, or rice) with any order. Then I would also offer a free chip bag on orders over $15.  Last I would have staff monitor the tables and offer salsa about every 5-10 minutes (come to us so we don't have to come to you). 

Remember this review isn't negative, but to be special, you have to offer something special.  Right now the food is good, but the nuances of the value for what you are getting make it seem... average."}
{"text":"I love the new Restaurant! It was open and  i honestly like the set up better than the old location. Also I like to change it up and get something new every time I order and it's always high quality Mexican food. I still can't find a favorite thing on the menu because it's all amazing! I recommend Tia Rosas to everyone"}
{"text":"Their taco truck came to our apt. and we wanted to try them out and support local restaurants. so we ordered taquitos which came with three taquitos, shredded cheddar cheese and guac, and sour cream. Disappointed, once I opened the box, first thing that came to mind was Costco Frozen taquitos, lame. Ordered rice too, lame as well. $8bucks I could've  spend at taco bell and had a better din din.props to My guerita wife who taught  her self to cook and man, she can make better taquitos,guac and red rice than Tia Rosas."}
{"text":"Totally loved their small beef burrito. The enchilada and tacos are also good.  I couldn't even waste a single one of their homemade chips.  Come on ova to this busy joint, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our favorite!! Best Mexican Food in town!!! Delicious seafood enchiladas and chicken tacos. The flying saucer is also a favorite."}
{"text":"This place only gets 2 stars for cleanliness. Service was non existent, so was flavor.  The prices were outrageous and the 'mexican' food was mediocre at the very least.  Their salsa was canned tomato sauce, no flavor whatsoever. I cook better at home.  The fact that we spent $43 and chips were extra is just ridiculous.  If you want really good 'fast' Mexican, go to senior taco.  Even their waitstaff had attitude.  Too bad, because they are so close to my house.  Just very disappointed:("}
{"text":"This place has been so hyped up we decided to give it a try for lunch one day. 

EVERYTHING IS ALA CART.

No service to be had. EVERYTHING is extra or on the side. If you want salsa or any sauce of any sort you have to ask for it and its a hassle because the service is non-existent.

I witnessed a male serving food and he had his bare hands on a lady's burrito before he set it down in front of her to keep it on the plate. I don't think that is acceptable. I just wanted a refund at that point, especially since the wait was terrible.

We had to ask how much longer our lunch was going to take as our break was almost over and we still had not received our purchases after waiting 15+ minutes. The food came out about 5 minutes after that. No salsa, no extra anything, back to the line... SIGH.

We will not be returning to Tia Rosa or visiting any other locations.

I wish they put as much thought into their food service and presentation as they did the wall decor."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but I'm sorry to say that the food here sucks, at least what we ordered did, and the herbs used for the rice were weird.  We had a cheese quesadilla, shrimp tacos, and bean and cheese chimichanga. I can't speak for the other dishes because from what I've seen of the pics, the food looks delicious. Nothing about this place tasted like authentic Mexican. I could have had a better meal at Los Betos, Filibertos, or Senor Tacos.  The cheese is our quesadilla tasted like imitation cheese and the beans had a funny taste.  Don't waste your money :-("}
{"text":"I hate writing these reviews! In a nut shell, awesome staff, beautiful decor....mediocre food. 

Salsa was the worst thing, which sort of sets a tone. The beans were actually pretty good, enchiladas where as expected, but that darn salsa...just plain old boring and bland. 

I'm not going to name drop....but if you're in the parking lot reading all these 3 star reviews....just look around, awesome Mexican food and salsa are within eye sight!!"}
{"text":"To put this in perspective, I had a super busy day and didn't have time to eat, and it was 7pm and I would've eaten my own arm at that point. I saw their \"taco truck\" on Higley/Williamsfield and pulled over, because TACOS. Long story short, they didn't have street tacos, so ordered a chicken burrito. I thought it was going to be grilled, but it was shredded.... the driest, most bland overcooked shredded chicken I think I've ever eaten in my life. Now.... I eat stuff I don't care for ALL THE TIME. If it's food, I'll eat it. But THIS... it was so unpalatable that I couldn't eat it. I literally couldn't make myself eat it. I don't think that has ever happened in my life. So, I feel that people should know about it. Here you go."}
{"text":"Incredibly mediocre Mexican food at high prices. Strike one,  one they close at 9 PM, even on Friday & Saturday, what kind of a successful restaurant closes at 9 PM? Also, they are not open on Sundays. We were there at 8:30 pm  on a Saturday and there was a steady flow of customers, they could probably capitalize on being open until 10 or 11.
     The dining room is clean and inviting but a bit too bright(no ambiance), they do have several televisions with a variety of sports on. I got the Chicken burrito which was bland and not very flavorful, I ordered the Grande size which was not very grande , the small size which my son got was absurd, he ended up having to get a second one. The only reason I got a Chicken Burrito is a steak burrito was twice as much($4.99 for chicken, $9.99 for steak). The guacamole & salsa was flavorless, the salsa may as well be ketchup. The chips are too thin and too little salt variety.
    Their prices are way to high for a self serve restaurant, this alone will keep me from returning.
The Horchata was tasty and they did have bottles of Negra Modelo which is nice.
  Three stars, not memorable but not horrible, Might stop in again but certainly won't be one of my regular stops."}
{"text":"Of course it is difficult to match the \"old\" Tia Rosa with it location, the food, the ambiance. That being said, the new incarnation on Greenfield is a great compromise.  It has a simplified menu, no waitstaff, and is appropriately small for the area. I assume they are fiscally sound and will not be pushed out (like the \"old\" Tia Rosa) because of a greedy landlord.  

Now, about the food here.  I had a salmon enchilada and the wife a chicken mole enchilada. Total bill for a party of 2, $17 bucks for a delicious dinner.  Their salsa are really good too. The place was jammed on a Tuesday night and everybody seemed to be happy to be here. The premises were clean. Parking was easy. 

Yes, you have to step up to a counter and take a number.  But, the great food makes up for the inconvenience.  If I want a fancy restaurant I will dress up a little and pay 3 times as much. 

I have earmarked Tia Rosa as a go-to place for a not-so-fancy dinner. 

Four stars is deserved!"}
{"text":"Boca Taqueria provides a very memorable dining experience with all the familiar tastes and ambience you are looking for in true Mexican cuisine.  Thanks Boca Taqueria, for the exceptional quality and flavor!"}
{"text":"The food was so bland that it's not surprising that only snowbirds can tolerate eating here. This place is about as Mexican as John McCain. High prices, tiny portions and tasteless food. What a shame."}
{"text":"High prices & mediocre food. We got the stuffed quesadilla and mole. Mole was dry but decent. Quesadilla was runny and soggy. Sad....really wanted to like this place because the owners seem so nice."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican Seafood in all of Phoenix. In particular the Salmon Mango Tacos and the Salmon enchiladas in Avocado Sauce. If I was able to give 4.5 stars I would though because they don't have good chips and you have to pay for them but their seafood is unparalleled. If you want more traditional style non-seafood dishes as well as great chips and salsa go across the parking lot to Salsa Cabana. How lucky though that there are two amazing Mexican places in the same parking lot. I go to both weekly."}
{"text":"I've been going to various Tia Rosa's locations for over ten years and have given good reviews to several but this location is the worst. It's another taqueria style place where you place your order, take a number and they bring out the food (eventually). After ordering our food, seafood tacos, we tried to find a table that wasn't being blown away by the many ceiling fans. After a twenty minute wait, and seeing other customers who came in later get their food, we asked about our order. They did bring out one dish, which was cold, and said the other would be coming out soon. After another five minuets, the second dish was served but it was cold also. When asked about the delay, the server said they forgot the food and it didn't come out. Next time I'm going to Rubio's."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this new location. I used to go to the one on McKellips and loved it but this place not so much. I won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Good Mexican for \"fast food\" 
Service was good and food came out quick. 

I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Mexican food is not my most favorite of cuisines. I came in here out of convenience and I wanted something fairly quick. They deliver on both counts. 

The food is acceptable. One person complained in another review the portions are too small for the money. I think Americans are brainwashed to believe we need to have super-sized portions in everything. Hence the obesity problem, but I digress...

I ordered one grilled salmon taco. It was 4 bucks. It's salmon so it's bound to be a little more pricey, but I was ok with it. I also ordered a side of refried beans (1.49) and a 2 Oz side of guacamole (.99). 

I probably waited between 5 and 10 minutes.. The food came out pretty fast and it was a 6\" double flour tortilla overflowing with salmon, mango and others bits. I put on some salsa and the guacamole, and it was hard to eat because there was so much stuff. The beans were tasty and an ample amount. Chipotle hands down has the best guacamole. The guac was ok. The only complaint I have is they stuck a bunch of wilted lettuce on the plate. It neither looked good or tasted good. Note to chef: If it looks bad, leave it off the plate. Thank you. 

I didn't feel like the portions were too small at all. I felt my hunger was satisfied. For what I got (taco, beans and guac) in spent 6.99. Not bad at all. 

Overall, I would come back. It's not a bad little joint. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We wanted to go to another restaurant for a quick lunch date, but the restaurant was closed.... so Boca Taqueria was in the same shopping center and we decided the patio outside seemed cute and it was a nice day out.

Staff at the register seemed bored to be there. I asked about the meat stuffed quesadilla plate, because under the item name it said: 
-served with sour cream, guacamole and chile strips
-served with rice and beans.

He said yes, it's a good amount sized plate.(ok, didn't answer my question but I ordered it in chicken)

Boyfriend ordered the three tacos plate, I guess? We bought this food and two bottles of domestic beer and paid over $30.

Took our table number and sat outside. Waiter brought us out plates, no silverware, and no sour cream or guacamole like the entree described. Boyfriend's tacos were smaller tacos then I have ever seen, and I'm taking even for children's menus... I know street tacos come small but this was ridiculous...

I had to go inside to ask about silverware, and ask about sour cream and guacamole. Apparently this new staff I was talking too was either very busy or annoyed to be at work that day too. Let me clarify, they weren't rude, they just weren't very nice or helpful either. I was pointed towards an island with the soda machine, the silverware are on the backside, so that was my mistake for not noticing. He also informed me the meat quesadilla had the sour cream and guacamole inside.

Now if I was told that or the menu insinuated this, I would have ordered something else or asked for it on the side. I have lived in Arizona most of my life, eaten Mexican food from Nevada to New Mexico to even south Colorado. 

I have never had sour cream and guacamole served inside a hot grilled quesadilla.

I don't know if they do this to skimp on quesadilla fillings or to save money on serving less sour cream and guacamole. It was just kind of gross and disappointing, of course overly soggy and ooey-gooey in a bad way.

It got worse when I asked for salsa. The salsa is some tomato concoction where they added some sort of dried cumin or paprika to it. No heat at all, and it tasted anything but fresh.

It wouldn't have been so disappointing if maybe they were just expensive, or maybe if the staff was the only issue, but when you add bad food to bad staff to bad prices, we won't ever be back. No one checked on us, I felt like I was inconveniencing them asking everything I did, and my boyfriend left hungry, even after I had to share my rice and beans... which by the way were the only thing we both said was tasteful."}
{"text":"This \"original\" Tia Rosa is a conundrum because the food is good but the overall experience is confusing. Question to answer: are you a counter service restaurant or sit-down dining experience? Let me help:

Counter Restaurant: walk up, order your own, pay for chips and salsa that are served in disposable bowls that are way too small for even the broken chips to dip. You expect this at a counter restaurant and come to accept it. Expect counter experience. 

Sit-Down: PRICIER but a willing exchange for the service, ceramic, glassware and maybe some fancy napkins or something.  Expect sit down prices with all the corners cut. 

In the end, I'd be much happier if you were priced like a counter restaurant. Good is good but overpriced. And give us a bowl that can fit a chip!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**
I came across them with their food truck! The food truck menu is significantly smaller than the restaurant's menu, but everything can be made vegetarian! Extremely quick service as well. 

Meal: Macho Nachos
Great nachos with all of the toppings, just a little too large for lunch. 

Definitely looking forward to going to the restaurant to try more food.

TIP: If it's not listed on the menu as vegetarian, ask for it to be made veggie, and it will probably be cheaper! 

PS: Don't forget to get a churro! They're tasty."}
{"text":"I got the Macho Nachos with beef and a steak taco which is heavily over priced. The taco just lacked overall flavor. The beef in the Nachos was dry to my liking but the retried beans cheese made up for what could have been a disappointing dish. The salsas , red and green both were really toned down for someone like me enjoys a little heat as far as red sauce goes. This place I would recommend for a person who would shy away from a real deal Mexican hideaway. I gave it 3 stars for the comfortable environment . Peace!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Ordered a shrimp burrito and no shrimp was in it, place was messy. Won't go back"}
{"text":"It's too bad that this business has to resort to scrubbing for diners parked across the street from the Mesa LDS temple when there is a food truck court at pioneer park. Bad formTia Rosa. Thought your business was better than that."}
{"text":"I had a horrible craving for Nachos.  I have heard from someone (I wish I would remember who it was to give them credit) that this Taqueria has some delicious nachos.  I decided to try them during my lunch break.  They are super delicious, to say the least.  Their meat (I got beef) was not ground, but shredded.  Perfect balance of guac, sour cream, cheese, and refried beans.  I also tried their sopapillas and they were scrumptious too!  I went after the lunch rush, so it was fast ordering my food.  The people there are courteous, and the place was nicely decorated and clean.  Now I want to try their tacos! ^_^"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Tia Rosa's for many years and always loved the food. We finally got around to visiting their new place. The food and service was outstanding. I always order something different and have never been disappointed. One of the best places for Mexican in the area. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love eating here! I'm not crazy about their beans, just something about the recipe is too strong for me, but overall a big fan of this place. The food is very authentic, I love the chips and salsa (especially the tomatillo salsa). My go-to is rolled chicken tacos with guacamole. I loved going to the other locations until they closed down, I'm so glad Tia Rosa's has survived in some form. The atmosphere and theme is fun and enjoyable. I've been eating at the various locations for years."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fresh and has a unique flavor that can only be found at Tia Rosa's. The beans are smokey and delicious. The beef is amazing. Try the red chili. It's more of a spicy shredded beef than a stew."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Didn't like Rosa's and really hoped the new name would include a new menu as well, I was sadly mistaken. Never written a review before but this was soo bad I couldn't help it. The cashier didn't know what was in the food: had to call a manager, they were out of half the drinks, their food was over priced and under delivered in EVERY WAY! I ordered a burrito and my girlfriend a shrimp taco. Upon receiving the food I could see it didn't live up to the $22 price tag, the regular shrimp burrito was kids size, the shrimp wasn't deveined, every sauce was full of sugar, and to top it off the guacamole we paid $3 for was freezer fresh! This is the last time we will be returning especially due to the fact that a Manager was present and made no effort to restock the restaurant or check on us to see if we enjoyed it. Don't recommend!"}
{"text":"The salsa was a 2 because the chips were cold and it cost a dollar fifty extra and they brought it out in little solo to go containers. The chicken mole was a 3. The cinnamon flavors with the chocolate didn't work well together but the heat factor was just right. The butternut squash chile verde pork enchilada was a 4   Great combo of salty and sweet. The cheese enchilada was a solid 5. The smokiness in the red sauce was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The salmon tacos are the best ever. Love the green salsa.    Best beans and rice!  It's one of Mesa's best restaurants.  The service is quick and friendly enough though that definitely not the best part of this place....it's the food!!"}
{"text":"Finally realized this place is open! Was excited to see this place going in but it felt like they were under construction for ever.

I wanted this place to be awesome because Hacienda de Rosa's Restaurante was just awful.  This is a walk up and order place but you can take a seat in a pretty large floor space for dining-in.  Like I said before we came in to order and go, my wife and I both got the cornitas seafood and it was awesome!

Service was pretty quick to even though the place was super busy.  We are in the area so it's great to find an awesome Mexican food place nearby.  Keep up the great work! :-)"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant! I started eating their shrimp tacos 30 years ago, and I've never turned back. Amazing marinated and roasted meats, grilled seafood, and fresh salsas. Even their refried beans have a special smoky flavor. It's a casual taqueria where you order at the counter. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"What a change from the previous location.  This place is set up a lot like Matta's.  You order your food, pay for it, and it is brought out to you.  Chips and salsa - are you kidding me you have to pay for chips and salsa.  The utensils are the cheap plastic forks and knives you buy at the dollar store.  Service is almost non-existent.  You had a great business I hope this new business model survives.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food is as good as before the relocation (which is far superior to the food at the Rosas that took over the McKellips location), but the service is really poor.  
I called in an order when when I left my home, and I was promptly put on hold. I drove for five minutes to get to the restaurant, when I did there was no one in line and the employees were just screwing around. So I placed my order at the counter instead, and then finally someone answered the phone and took me off of hold. I was on hold for almost a minute before they answered and by then I had already ordered in the store. They are going to have to do better than that."}

I was driving this morning, coming South on Greenfield Road approaching Brown Road in Mesa AZ.  In the strip mall on my left (NE corner of Greenfield & Brown) I saw a sign hidden in the parking lot lot.  The sign was behind the \"Epic Hair Studio\", and visible when people walked out of the gym there into the parking lot.  The sign said the following:

\"Coming Soon, Tia Rosa.  Until we open, please visit us at our location in Gilbert off Higley Road. \"  

If this comes to fruition, and it does come back into business at this location, I will be a regular customer...again.  Hope that the food is still good!!!!

Eluding to my previous comment, there is a location of Tia Rosa @ the  NE corner of Greenfield & Brown in Mesa.  They have been open for maybe 2-3 weeks maximum.  The place is actually more like a taqueria or cantina, and more of a casual fast food type.  

I was really put off by it.  This is the reason I rated 2 stars.  I went in there and ordered the three tacos combo (seafood tacos).  The portions were very tiny.  It amounted to two star food (quality and quantity) for five star price/cost.  I was really disappointed.  My wife has some other colorful words to say that are not politically correct to say (she described the food and place with four letter words).

I can find better tacos, seafood or otherwise, with appropriate portion, at a lower price at a Mexican food street kiosk or \"walkup\" in metro Phoenix any day.  The Mexican markets (even those in Mesa) make better tacos.  Going to this location was a real let down!  I was a fool to spend my money here!  

I hope that you are able to turn it around, as you will disappoint many followers with what you are doing at Greenfield and Brown in Mesa today.  You might as well have just kept the Gilbert location on Higley, and never bothered to re-open in Mesa AZ."}
{"text":"Aw man, loved Rancho de Tia Rosa, and been wanting to try their new incarnation since it opened.  It was okay.  The beans tasted smoky, and that's a plus, really yummy.  The rice was pedestrian, my Mexican stepmom makes better when she's not even trying.  But the green chile pork burro....what the heck is in there that's SWEET?!  And I don't mean like a mild, caramelized onion kind of sweet, I mean like cinnamon apples kind of sweet.  When I bite into chile verde, I don't expect sweet.  I may give it another try but I wasn't all that impressed."}
{"text":"This has always been a fantastic restaurant and while the ambience does not reach the previous establishment the food was outstanding"}
{"text":"Things have gone wrong since they moved locations. I ordered the chicken mole platter with rice and I had about two bites and quit. I don't know if it was just an off day, but the first bite that I had was cold and the second was all tendon. I don't know about you, but when I bite into tendon, it sets me teeth on edge and I can't eat anything else. I attempted to eat the rice but after a bite I quit as well. It tasted like it was out of a box. The mole sauce itself was nothing but spice. No flavor at all. Needless to say, I won't be back to this location."}
