{"text":"Awesome family run place with great food and service.  I was visiting from (way) out of town and found this restaurant from fellow Yelpers' recommendations.  I went for dinner and had an excellent experience.  The food was freshly made by Peter and was delicious.  There's quite a varied menu with something for everyone.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast with my dad and absolutely loved this place. 
The service was very welcoming and friendly. Very attentive.
The food was outstanding. I mean, I only had the bacon and eggs, but it was well made and great quality and quantity.
This is exactly the kind of restaurant I like. Very clean and basic decor,  great prices with great quality of food.
This was my first time here, my dad's second time. He had the western sandwich before and said it was perfect.
It's a small little mom and pop shop in a little run down plaza, out of the way of the lakeshore strip. I really hope it stays afloat and does well for itself. It's our new go-to place for brunch and lunch. We plan on going back again soon for dinner to try out their burgers. 
Wide selection of menu, anywhere from pancakes to sandwiches to burgers and steaks and chicken dinners.
I HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"This is a nice place opened in the neighborhood. Went there for breakfast. The pancakes were really good. They come with a strawberry preserve made from scratch everyday."}
{"text":"4 of us went here for breakfast yesterday. Great selection for breakfast, lunch & dinner. My western sandwich was huge(4 eggs) and came with home fries for 5.99. My kids ordered the breakfast skillets. Lots of food, had to take some home. I for see this little restaurant becoming a local fave! Reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"I ate lunch at Peter's the other day and ordered a chicken soulvaki pita. The food was really good and tasty with a good portion size.  My friend had a burger, it was a homemade patty, very tender and savoury.  The service was excellent, couldn't ask for better.  The menu is pretty big, there's something for everyone. I can't wait to come back and try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Everything we've eaten here, so far, has been super yummy! I'm obssessed with the waffles with berries and whipped cream - so good! Also, the breakfast sandwiches are always perfectly cooked, and the home fries are very crispy and delicious and clearly made in house. Burgers are big and juicy. Fries are light and crispy. AND the owners and staff are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Came here with my dad for breakfast about 2 saturdays ago. And i have to say it's a cute little place for breakfast. The food was good, staff was great and very welcoming and attentive. I will definitely be recommending this place to everyone! :)"}
{"text":"Service was the best the waitress I had was very friendly. I've been a couple times now and they are 10/10. The food is fantastic and I look forward to eating there many more times. Don't pass this place up it's a hidden gem"}
{"text":"I love places like this they have a good menu, and GREAT ingredients.  The quality is amazing I had Peter's chicken club and it was amazing.  Breakfast there is something to look forward to.  The fluffier the pancakes and REAL maple syrup. No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice and clean and quick service. The food was good. We had the omelettes: feta/spinach and western.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual meal.  I've had breakfast there several times and it's been consistent each time.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sometimes, a breakfast spot can feel super basic and not-so-special. Other times, a breakfast spot can serve up dishes in a very clean, cozy yet modern setting with great quality food that catches your attention despite being basic, everyday breakfast dishes - this is one of those times. Peters in Port Credit is basically an illustration of Sunset Grill meets Pinterest, with ordinary offerings but fresher and better quality dishes, and with kitschy yet modern decor to top off your experience. A really nice and bright spot to start your mornings. Also note that between 7AM to 10AM on weekdays, they have a $5.95 classic breakfast special.

First, parking. It's located in a very small plaza just west of Lakeshore Road W and Mississauga Road, and it was difficult finding parking in this plaza at around 9:30 AM on a Saturday morning. We ended up parking on the residential street just west of the restaurant. 

Second, the food. We ordered the Classic Breakfast ($7.95) and the Corned Beef Hash & 3 Eggs ($10.95) with coffee and tea. Overall, they've taken ordinary, basic breakfast offerings that you can find anywhere, and they serve it fresh, piping hot, and cooked very well. These didn't look like the usual limp breakfast plates served at all-day breakfast chains. The meat was well-seasoned, and the dishes were nice and comforting. The breakfast menu had a good amount of variety, and the portion sizes were just right. They also served me gluten-free toast and rye toast, at no extra charge!

Service was incredibly friendly and warm. Coffee was topped off without being asked. We will definitely be back! A great addition to the neighbourhood. 

For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $30.00."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so much, but the pancakes were not happening at all.  Even my girlfriends said they didn't get full or truly enjoyed their meals.  Most of the stars are going towards service.

We came in around 9:30 on a Saturday morning.  We got the last table big enough to fit our group.  Phew!  Right away our server started us with drinks.  I got a fresh squeezed orange juice and my girlfriends got coffee.  The orange juice was delicious from what I could taste.  I was sick that day. Food came our fairly quickly after placing our order.  I got the pancakes with 1 egg on the side.  One egg was only $1.00.  My one gf got the smoked salmon benny and my other gf got the 3 egg classic. My pancakes were not fluffy at all.  In fact, they were pretty hard.  They also had a strange after taste.  It was so sour.  I thought it was just me because I was sick, but when my one gf tried it, she had the same reaction.  Some weird sour after taste that was not pleasant at all.  It's something I've never tasted in pancakes before.  I only ate 1 of the 3 and took the other 2 home.  Even when I tried to eat them the next day, it was just not happening.  Super hard and sour. My girlfriends didn't think their meals were super special and the home fries were meh.  We all agreed we won't return.  It is a drive for us just to go for breakfast anyways.  We have better and closer breakfast places such as Flips, in Brampton.

Service; however, was top notch.  They were friendly and constantly clearing dishes.  So that was nice.  Sadly, not enough to have us come back."}
{"text":"Breakfast was excellent -eggs cooked perfectly. I love that they have turkey bacon as a protein option. Service was with a smile and very friendly. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The place is small and very busy on weekend. Great for breakfast, especially eggs benny. Portions are always generous and prices are very reasonable. If you prefer gluten free toast, note that there is a $1.50 up charge. You can't go wrong here for breakfast. The only drawback is the lack of parking."}
{"text":"Good food, evrything is fresh and service is fast. Will definetely come back"}
{"text":"Excellent little restaurant for breakfast lunch and quick dinner.  Great quality food with options for food allergies.
Great service and presentation on Lakeshore."}
{"text":"Going into this new restaurant, I still had memories of the Chinese restaurant that occupied this location before. Thankfully, the place is refreshed, cleaned up and offers a great all day menu with breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The menu is pretty comprehensive with great choices for breakfast, lunch or dinner at anytime they are open. The interior has about 10 tables for 2 and about 2 tables for four although I'm sure they could re-arrange things in necessary. In total, I think it can accommodate 30-40 people, so its not that large.

We had the Peters Waffle which included a fresh waffle, tons of strawberries and whipped cream, and a Western sandwich which had 4 eggs, ham and onion. They also have an early bird special for $5.95 which is available before 7am.

It had been opened for 5 days when we went there and I'm sure that in time, there will be regular line-ups for breakfast. The best way to review this new restaurant is to offers some \"pros\" and \"cons\". As you can see, very little in the way of negatives.

Pros

- They have a great assortment on the menu
- Breakfast food is done well and portions are good
- The interior is clean and service is prompt and friendly
- There is a good amount of free parking in the area
- Easy to see if they have room inside when driving by

Cons

- The indoor temperature drops quite a bit when people open the door (so you might be better off sitting at the back)
- Future line-ups due to the small size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Peter's is an awesome breakfast place in Port Credit that is friendly, clean, and most importantly serves up great food.

Not pretentious like other brunch/breakfast places try to be in this area, Peter's offers consistency, affordable prices, and great portions that always hits the spot!

The wait staff is always happy to see you and able to set a positive tone for your day. 

Recommendations:  
* The classic breakfast is a hit that always pleases
* The eggs benedict selections are great
* Corn beef hash is nice and tasty but not greasy

Tip:  Ask for the freshly squeezed OJ!

Wish:  Additional parking"}
{"text":"I randomly came across Peters in my quest for gluten free French toast. The parking situation was fine because it was later in the morning but I imagine at peak times you'd have to park elsewhere. The lot is right off lakeshore so you'd have to back out onto lakeshore if it was full. 
The inside was small, clean and cute. We were offered drinks as soon as we sat and for the first time in ages, the little tea pot I was given didn't leak (it leaks everywhere! Maybe just me?) 
I ordered the French toast combo. It came with two pieces of French toast, 3 eggs, 3 bacon, 3 sausage and home fries. Since they weren't sure about the sausages being gfree, they subbed in bacon. I also ordered a large bowl of fruit. 
Husband ordered the signature combo which came with 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, peameal, ham, baked beans and home fries. He wasn't a fan of the home fries but I loved them. The French toast was a raisin cinnamon bread which made it super delicious and the rest was fresh and tasty as per most brunch places. The fruit bowl was kinda small considering the price tag ($7) but everything in it was fresh so I didn't mind. The coffee and hot water was bottomless and our cups never reached empty. The waitresses were very attentive but not annoying and made the experience very enjoyable. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We've been to Peter's several times now and I can't say enough about how good it is. 

The food is consistently good, always piping hot and fresh. The servers are always so friendly and attentive. 

No matter how busy it is, the food always comes out very quickly. 

The eggs are always cooked exactly as we've ordered (nice, runny yolks). They have gluten-free toast for a small additional cost, which I really appreciate. 

The menu is quite varied with plenty of (all day) breakfast items, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soups, wings and waffles. 

The restaurant is always clean and bright. Oh, and the servings are HUGE!"}
{"text":"We are obviously on a quest to try all of the breakfast joints in the area. Peters is fairly new and we have consistently driven past it on the way to other restaurants. 

We finally stopped in today for breakfast. The menu is big, but thankfully the same as one of our other favourite restaurants, Sunlight Grill. Asking a server, apparently the two restaurants are owned by same partners. 

Food was pretty good, standard breakfast fare. Overall a bit salty for me, but that's what happens when you have bacon and sausages on the same plate. I offloaded my breakfast meats to my bf. Pancakes were yummy. A huge plus was that they had no sugar added syrup available, which is pretty rare. I usually bring my own when I know I'm having pancakes. 

The location is small and fills up quickly. Mostly with friends of the owner, it would seem."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast last week. I had the pancakes with chocolate chips. I didn't really like it much. They tasted doughy to me. My boyfriend had  sausage eggs and french toast and he was pretty content with his. It's a nice looking clean spot inside with quick service. Oh! But those potatoes were cooked just right."}
{"text":"Pretty basic brunch food. The menu is quite extensive though so there is definitely something for everyone. Service is quick and friendly but the decor is very basic..just a few tables and chairs. I had the omelette and for the price you pay you get quite a bit of food!"}
