{"text":"I have been here several times and had the steak sandwich, which is made with real pieces of steak. It's been delicious everytime.   My wife loves the club sandwich, because it has real turkey and ham on it. Not lunch meat."}
{"text":"Seriously, some of the absolute best burgers. Period! Anywhere. Great wings. Service a little slow but extremely well mannered and polite. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went with 6 others there last week.  Great service,  food and drinks.  Try the Scottish eggs.  Very nice beer selection too. Was our first time there and won't be the last."}
{"text":"4/3/16: Pulled this place up on Yelp and figured I'd try it out since I needed somewhere to read a few papers (yes, at a bar). I'm from out of town and it was a pretty drive out to this little town. I ordered a beer from their nicely sized selection, they have a full bar if you'd prefer a cocktail.  They had smaller menu which usually means what they have on it is good!   I ordered the special grilled cheese that had all the BT burger toppings (fried egg, pickle slice, thick slabs of bacon, grilled onions and a delicious, slightly spicy sauce) and came with fries. Omg this was the best grilled cheese I've ever had. The bread was a nice thick Texas style so it held this big sandwich together in all of its glory. The picture I took doesn't do it justice. Every ingredient was of the correct portion. YUM :)  Every single staff member I talked to was friendly and happy! Special thanks to what seemed to be the chef who explained the specials to me and stopped by to ask me how my food was and to my awesome server Mallory!  If you're near by, stop in! You won't be disappointed.   Other pros: good prices, clean bathroom and clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Did a search for a brewpub on my way to Pitt Intl Airport to save us the expensive and usually lousy airport food.  Boy am I glad we picked this place!  Excellent beer selection and everything on the menu looked great making decisions tough.  Burgers were perfectly cooked, huge and tasty.  Did I mention the owner took care of us, was extremely friendly and service was quick?  Don't pass on the fresh tater tots with your meal!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in with my brother for a couple beers. Impressive selections on the craft beer menu and our bartender was an excellent guide. We'll be back for lunch 'cause that menu looks good. Wow, Bridgetown Taphouse - in my hometown. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Great food. Great draft offering. Scotch eggs are excellent. Had a nice lunch with the family here and will be back for drinks with friends. Stop in!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and awesome staff. Had the sausage meatball sandwich and fries, both were very good. Hung out at the bar after dinner and had a nice conversation with the owner. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood bar. The service was friendly and quick.  Has a nice beer selection on tap.  The hippie (portobello) sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich were both quite good.  Fries and tots, with seasoning, were excellent... Not at all greasy. The kitchen clearly cares about the food they are serving.  Will definitely return to try more on this interesting menu."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The best beer cheese I've ever had. Fresh cut fries and great brioche bun on La Flama grilled chicken sandwich. The Cuban is also very good! Loved it. Best place to eat in Ambridge and an excellent selection of craft brews and liquor."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. My boyfriend got the peanut butter burger, which I was wary about, and it was actually awesome. Great craft beer selection and a super friendly bartender. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my husband and we loved it.  The food and serve was awesome.  So friendly and the atmosphere was very inviting.  Definitely will go back.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regular at the taphouse since it's about a 3 minute walk from our front door. The food here is fantastic. Try the tots, the steak fries, the blue ribbon chicken, and the velvet Elvis burger with peanut butter. Just try it all! Love having such good food in Ambridge!"}
{"text":"Solid burger, great draft list, and a delicious honey mustard. Cuban is pretty tasty too though mustard/pickle distribution heavily favored only one half. Felt meh about the first half, and I loved the second half! ;)  Downsides, it is really loud and there isn't much seating. When you go in, you don't really know what to do. Do you wait to be seated? Grab a table? If there are no tables, do you wait? Does someone make a list or do you just stand there and hope to grab a table in the dining room once someone gets up? On our second visit we opted not to wait and see what the procedure was because we had no idea how many people might be there wanting a table before us. We just went elsewhere.   We will probably hit this place up again if in the area and not during regular dinner hours (busy and so so loud)."}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Great place to hangout and meet new friends. Wide selection of beers at reasonable prices. Great liquor selection. I'm a whiskey girl and was kept quite happy in their beer dominated world.   I can't wait to try the food. I've been going since their opening weekend and it's been wonderful each time."}
{"text":"Bridgetown Taphouse is a wonderful place to eat. The wings are freshly made and delicious ! The dressings are homemade. My husband loves the burgers and fresh cut fries...my mouth waters at the very thought of their menu. Everything we've tried, we have greatly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Bridgetown Taphouse is a soon to be (not quite open yet, as of 2-18-2015) gastropub and beer smorgasbord in Ambridge, PA, featuring hearty, homemade cold weather menu items that are sure to warm your stomach and drinks that are sure to warm your soul.  But seriously, this is a new bar/taphouse run my some cool kids I went to school with. The beer is sure to be cold and the food should be banging, so check them out! They are right next to Yoga Edge on Merchant St."}
{"text":"Excellent food beer and service. Thanks yelp! Next time in area we will b back!  Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service & Guinness on tap.  Clean & open all the time, including take out."}
{"text":"Great food and beer selection. Bartenders are very knowledgeable about the beer selection. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food and beer is a great selection. On a busy playoff Steeler Sunday, the bartender had the bar and the tables as well. She was absolutely excellent. Great place to visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best bar in Ambridge.  I've been threw a couple times.  It has a great atmosphere.  I nice selection of beers.  They seem to try to focus on cocktails, which is a nice change for this area.  The food gets better every time I go there. It's one great place and it gets better every time I go.  They appear to be making this a destination and their efforts are paying off."}
{"text":"We had delicious food, great beers and wonderful service at the Bridgetown Taphouse. It's so wonderful to have a place like this in Ambridge and my family and I will continue to support this business!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday after church for lunch.  There were three families so we needed seating for 13.  The bartender/waitress gave major attitude about having to push a couple of tables together and scolded us for not calling ahead.  We proceeded to walk out and was scolded once more in front of our small children since their staffing issues were clearly our fault."}
{"text":"I've been to Pitt a dozen times and wanted to try something new, so found this place. It had a great little hometown atmosphere and the bartender was amazing. She had a lot of recommendations for us regarding the food and beer selection, all were great. Food is fresh and the only things they freeze are edamame and tots. We got the Bridgetown and Pittsburgher, and they were seriously the best burgers I've ever had. Would highly recommend and will def be back!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the Ambridge neighborhood. Tasty food and generous portions. Service is friendly as well."}
{"text":"Had the Bridgetown burger which was excellent along with the fresh cut fries.  Hubby disappointed with the soup special (kielbasa & saurkraut) - said it didn't taste bad but there were only a few pieces of ground up keilbasa.  His burger, the Pittsburgher, was good also but said they need a better capicola. Nice decor, server friendly.  Only bad thing is there was a bad sewer odor.  Please get it fixed."}
{"text":"Good beer selection! Cocktails are a bit overpriced for the suburbs. Food is pretty good. Good atmosphere. Nice place to hang out! Hard to find around Beaver County!"}
{"text":"Went for another award-winning fish sandwich and beer tonight. Only this time the sandwich was a letdown. Sat way in the back and saw into the kitchen - racks of fried fish. What? Not sure how they do it, but the fish you order is obviously not fresh fried per order. And when I got my sandwich it tasted that way - not crispy, not fresh. Still huge, just not nearly as good. The fries were perfect - hot and crispy, the beer was cold, and the wait staff was nice and attentive. Split a half order of wings first, and they were just right. I should have gone for a burger. I understand that they have a crush on Fridays for their fish sandwich, but they have to find a better way."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The wings are amazing, the beer selection stellar, the waitresses are great.  They serve Tater Tots as an option as a side with their sandwiches  which are amazing.  I am a buffalo chicken wing traditionalist but I am sold on their own Bridgetown BBQ wings which are   delicious.  It's inexpensive, unpretentious and has some of the best bar food I've had in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much on the outside, but very clean and welcoming on the inside. Been here two Friday's in a row. Burgers were very good and the fish sandwich was amazing; piece of fish was big, light and battered perfectly (believe they have the fish on Friday's during Lent and the first Friday of every month). The female bartenders were on their A game both visits for service, not to mention their politeness and kindness. The beers on tap seem to be rotated in and out. Definitely will continue to visit BT!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at BT.  I enjoyed it just as much as the first time.  I was greeted immediately upon entering the non-smoking bar on my way to the dining area in the back.  There are several t.v. sets all set to different channels with no sound. I liked that approach.  Great music is playing the entire time at a decent decibel. You can hear it but don't need to scream to be heard either.  Kelly was my server. She was very friendly, knowledgeable & attentive.  Bruschetta was our appetizer. It had wonderful flavor & was plated nicely.  We dined on the Bridgetown salad with chicken.  I don't like bleu cheese dressing but my daughter insisted that I try it on the first visit. It was so good & different that I actually requested it for my salad.  Generous portions of food. Pleasant atmosphere.  Friendly service.  I really enjoyed my dining experience & look forward to frequenting this business."}
{"text":"Good food good drinks fun time cost a little more than most places but it's well worth it the selection of beer is awesome the kitchen really knows what they're doing I would come here every day if I lived closer I recommend everyone stops by at least checks it out"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a place with good food and beer that was open on a Tuesday.  A friend recommended this place and I'm glad we went.  Crowd ranged from 20s- people who looked to be in their 80s.  Food was very good.  I had the Cuban with fries and she had the BLT with tots.  I preferred the tots, but both were good.  Appetizer was deep fried pickles that were lightly breaded and perfect.  Nice beer selection.  First time I've seen Blue Canoe here in the Valley.  Staff was fantastic.  Twice when my beer was empty while our waitress was off getting me another, a different server came over to see if I needed another.  They were really on top of things.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is great, excellent beer selection, really nice atmosphere. Non smoking. The food is Amazing! Fantastic burgers and fries, excellent wings! A really welcome addition to the area. If you're looking for a nice place to eat, have a few drinks and watch the game or listen to a local band, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"FINALLY... you don't  have to go to the \"South Side\"for a great sandwich & beer and watch the game!!  Nice selection ...reasonable prices. ..wonderful staff!! Great going Matt ... and partners:-)"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great bar tenders, cool beer selection, industrial vibe, live music on the weekends. Definitely a cool spot!"}
{"text":"I have passed Bridgetown Taphouse for over a year when I am in Ambridge and also heard lots of friends say it was good.  My wife and I were out on Saturday and decided to try it for lunch.  We were happy we did.  I had the prime rib sandwich special that came with a side of au jus for dipping and it was excellent.  We also tried the wings and they were FANTASTIC!  Good, meaty and crunchy.  Sauces were very good as well.  My wife ordered a salad and the staff was very accommodating when she realized she ordered a grilled chicken salad rather than the grilled buffalo chicken.  The waitress promptly brought the buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles to make the salad what she wanted.  We saw other orders come out and everything look great.  Home cooked and you can tell they take their time and prepare everything to order.  Although the entrance to the Taphouse makes it look like you are going into a dark, dingy bar, once you enter, it was clean, well lit and friendly.   It was very good and we will be back.  Give it a try!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Great burger, slaw was a little less vinger-y then I like but worked.  Appreciated the atmosphere and the service was great.  Will return."}
{"text":"Very good food, drinks, and service. I'm so glad this was on the Best of voting for Pittsburgh or we may have never heard about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection and the burgers are fantastic. Great service and very affordable."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome  Great service great food... and amazing selection of beer!! The tater tots are the greatest.... and they always have local beer and entertainment!"}
{"text":"We recently celebrated my mom's birthday here.  The wait staff was extremely nice and attentive, the food was delicious, and the tap selection was really good.  It was perfect!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place that you wouldn't expect to be in Ambridge. I like to compare it to Hollywood Gardens in Rochester. Nice feel but less taps and beer options. Prices are decent. Limited menu but the food is very good.  Who doesn't love a place that serves tots? Some recommendations - burger, pulled pork, steak sandwich and wings"}
{"text":"Best Brew Pub in the area. Always an excellent selection of craft beers and bourbon. John the head mixologist is serious about his craft.   Friendly staff, great food, and nonsmoking. BT is my go to pub."}
{"text":"So I had a long standing bad review here from when they first opened.    Mostly it was the waitress really rubbed is the wrong way and was just plain nasty.  Well it's been a couple years and decided to give it another shot.   I'm glad we did because the food has improved and has been very consistent over our past 3 visits.    Each time the bartender/waitress has been good and friendly.  We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great service no wait and bar tender is polite and on point. Will return."}
{"text":"We ran into this place on a whim and I am so glad we did! Don't know much about beer but this was the absolute best burger I've ever had. Tons of flavor, cooked perfectly, juicy, and amazing! Fries were great too! Waitstaff was super friendly and helped pick a perfect cider. It's a small cozy bar with great atmosphere! I will be stopping back any time I am near Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"A few months ago, a friend of mine described Bridgetown Taphouse as the best bar within ten miles either direction on Route 65. After several months, I can say it is one of the best restaurants, as well.   They recently started starting serving food and while the price is right, the quantity and quality is right, too. My wife and I both had a great meal with fresh ingredients for barely over $15. The plate size was enough that we had to take a box to go.   If you're looking to avoid the Cranberry or Robinson traffic and prices, this is a great place to consider. The staff is fast, friendly, and knowledgable. The food and drink selection is some of the best in the area. I can not say enough great things about this place.   My wife had a club sandwich with fresh, hand cut fries. The ham, turkey, and bacon were all brimming with flavor and thick cut. The bread was fresh, as well. I tried the hippie sandwich with tater tots. The tots were loaded with flavor and not greasy at all. The sandwich was loaded with a multitude of fresh veggies and topped with flavorful cheese and sauce.   If you're looking for a great, inexpensive meal in a fresh, clean environment try Bridgetown Taphouse. If you're looking for a clean, local place to catch a game with friends try Bridgetown Taphouse. If you're looking for a quick bite or drink after work, try Bridgetown Taphouse.   A+ on all levels."}
{"text":"This place was great! I forgot that I was in Ambridge! Our waitress was super nice and knew a lot about beer, even my husband was impressed. She didn't act put out by my not wanting lettuce on my sandwich and even recommended other things I Amy like. Do yourself a favor and try the bruschetta, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Great wings here. Tots are also really good. Bartenders are very nice. Great deal on wings during Steeler games. Live music every once in a while. The best thing by far is the atmosphere though. Really chill vibe here. Quiet enough that you can have a conversation without screaming to the person beside you.   Above was a draft I had a month ago. Forgot to finish it.   The place is still great. Wings are excellent. Had a group out Saturday night and our server \"pink\" was super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Very good burgers. Fries/tots were okay. Good atmosphere. Music was a little loud for my taste. Friendly waitress' & it is kid friendly in the dining area in the back. Read reviews before going and was confused based on other reviews so I called & they informed me it was kid friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Beaver County. Burgers are amazing, and they have tater tots!!! Ask for the BT dust on them - you won't regret it. Awesome beer selection too, and much cheaper than many other bars. I can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"This place was a gem. The turkey chili was phenomenal and unique. Had a dry rub for the wings, the BT dust, which I'd recommend. We split a fish sandwich that was huge. The fries were perfectly crunchy. And even the coleslaw was a delight. Non creamy and addicting. Definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of great things about Bridgetown since its opening and finally decided to make a visit. The atmosphere was great. I loved that it was a non-smoking pub and had a clean, welcoming environment. The food is great, the staff is very friendly and willing to help you in any way that they can, and there is plenty of seating as well. I definitely recommend this pub!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, great attentive (but not overbearing or annoying) staff, highly recommend. Nice drink and cocktail menu. If you find yourself hungry or thirsty  and in ambridge, check them out. Reasonable prices. Arsenal cider on tap."}
{"text":"Even tho it was a busy Saturday night, we were seated immediately - Renee sat us and took our order and our drinks were out in no time. My wife and I shared the Bridgeport Burger with tots but not before munching on the Scotch Eggs app which were eggs-cellent!! The Burger was cooked to order and very good. A great experience start to finish!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food!  Try the fish, it's delicious! An ever changing selection of beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for dinner.  We ordered the fried pickles appetizer, la flama blanca chicken sandwich with fries, and the portobello mushroom burger with a side of coleslaw.  What's Hot - Quality of food.  Hubby and I liked our food.  It was delish.  His flama blanca chicken sandwich had jalapeño slices and a spicy sauce.  It had a kick and was not overwhelming.  However, be aware if you're the type that likes your food hella spicy, this won't do it.  There is malt vinegar at the table, so you can add that to your fries, tots, whatevs.  My burger patty wasn't thin and cooked to order.   - Non mayo coleslaw.  Dudes, it's cool to find a place where the coleslaw isn't made with mayo.  Their coleslaw is made with a vinegar sauce and there are red onion slices in the coleslaw, too.  Something different, yet delicious.   - Fried pickles.  They use pickles from a local Burgh pickle company, which is delish.  Their fried pickles aren't overly breaded, too, which I like.  For me, if a fried dish is thickly battered, that tells me you're trying to hide something.  These pickles are definitely sour, but have a nice flavor.   - Price.  For the most part, their prices are reasonable and are reflective of their portions.  For example, my burger was around $10.  The fried pickles are pricey- around $7.  Total for me and hubby was around $35, including tip. - Menu variety.  The menu options are decent.  It's a one page menu.  You're not overwhelmed with choices.  They have a decent bar/drinks menu, too.  It's a one small one page menu- a few wines, a handful of mixed drinks, and half the page is beer. - Service.  No complaints.  The waitresses were nice, helpful, and attentive.    What's Not - Layout.  To be fair, many bars/taphouses in the Burgh are small.  That brings its pros and cons.  This place is no different.  It's small and somewhat compact.  There aren't many tables.  It can get busy easy and when it does get busy, the sound will carry.  By the time we left, this place was less than half full and already it was difficult to have a conversation.  Be prepared to talk loudly and not be able to hear the conversation easily.  Additionally, none of the tables seat more than 4 people.  I don't recommend large groups.  If that's an issue, call ahead to make a reservation.  - Dim.  The inside is very dimly lit, so it's not easy to see.  - Parking.  It's a small town area, so there aren't many parking options around when it's busy.  Be prepared to parallel park in the neighborhood.  I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but it's not the most convenient.      Final Answer Willing to come back again, but not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I like it more.  From the great beers to the good food and the excellent staff.  The staff really make the whole experience come together.  They consistently come up with good ideas, accommodate our kids (and the adults)."}
{"text":"This is probably the best bar in Ambridge. The food is excellent I've pretty much every single item on the menu at least once and I have never had a bad meal or a bad experience. I am a regular customer. The service is fast and friendly. Wings are amazing I highly recommend. They have a great atmosphere. They so many craft beers. They usually have pretty cool bands playing in Fridays or Saturdays."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here tonight for dinner and some drinks. We both loved it! We started with tater tots with DT dust (based on other recommendations on yelp) and they did not disappoint! I had the salad special and wings with lemon pepper dry rub. The wings were incredible! Very crispy and amazing flavor. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken salad. The chicken was grilled chicken and he really enjoyed it. I am a big hard cider lover. They had arsenal on draft and many different flavors of Blake's cider in cans. I had never heard of Blake's cider so I really enjoyed trying something new. Our waiter was very attentive and the service overall was great. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is probably the only place in Ambridge you are ever going to  find more than one craft beer on tap.  The selection is an impressive list of all the national and local favorites.  The food is where the sweet spot is here.  It's traditional bar fare but the quality is extraordinary in comparison to the amount you pay.  The only downside to this place is the clientele.  During my visit I was the only person drinking the type of beer this places advertises itself as being a source of.  The crowd was MUCH older than me and every other guy there was drinking regular Budweiser and/or Coors Light bottles.  The bar seemed like it was more of a 1980s road house style bar until new ownership modernized the place."}
{"text":"Best BLT I've had to date.  Not huge but a fantastic draft beer selection.  Extremely friendly staff, Kellie was bartending and her personality helped make for a great experience!  The chef came out and chatted with me and a client for awhile.  I'll be back for the Cuban next!"}
{"text":"So my current work has me situated in the Ambridge area, and having spent years in this area, I assumed that there was nothing new in \"Bridgetown\".  Was I ever wrong.  I have to hand it to these guys, they put together a great draft list, kick ass bar and some very fine eats.  To that, I have been twice in one week so I think I can safely give my fellow Yelpers a solid review.     Both times have been for lunch, but I will be heading back for dinner this week so I will give an update on that.   First I had the bruschetta chicken sandwich.  I have to say, solid idea with a nice piece of grilled chicken breast, not cut to thick or thin (bun sized), with fresh mozzarella on top.  The chopped tomatoes were nicely dressed and made for a great bite.  The next visit I had to try the Cuban.  One of my coworkers had it the first visit and I nearly took a bite off of his plate.  Solidly one of the best Cubans I have ever had in my life.  They have this down to a science.  They use a very high quality smoked ham, sliced perfectly.   A house smoked pulled pork, just the right tang on the pickle and the exotic (not sure what kind) mustard kick was the cherry on top.     They serve these sandwiches with either fries (very good), or tots (amazing).  Tots are an under-served side car these days, our friends at BT have found a way to make them mainstream.  If you get the tots, ask for the \"dust\" on the top.  Just like the 'spice' in Dune, this stuff is magically.  No ketchup or condiments needed if you get your tots dusted.    I have not experienced much of the draft list, just a few tastes.  I will say that it is solid and will update it as soon as I get a solid session in at the bar.  I suggest if you are near the BT, you stop in."}
{"text":"A hard and crunchy burger even I though I ordered it medium and I personally hate that slaw. And I have not a met a single person who likes their food. They warned me and I went anyway. And now I know. Bar food is supposed to be good. Not this bar food."}
{"text":"Bring back the fresh burgers. I will happily pay more for them. This is decent food at a decent price. I will go back."}
