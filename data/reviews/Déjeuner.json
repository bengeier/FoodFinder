{"text":"Dejeuner Inc.-\"Bitter\" Experience. I've eaten here several times. Good enough at best. Today we returned after a few months to find the prices had risen and the coffee was disgusting. \" Many customers have complained that our coffee is too strong,\" commented our lovely server after changing the first round of undrinkable coffee at our request. The second round was no better; we settled for drinking water instead.  While paying the bill at the cash, we were asked by the hostess/cashier if everything was to our satisfaction. I politely replied that we enjoyed the food but found the coffee too strong. \"This IS a breakfast place, you know! The coffee HAS to be strong to wake up the customers so they can work!\" Resisting the words that immediately came to mind, I chose instead to inform her that, remarkably, I had actually been to several \"breakfast place(s)\" throughout my adult life and had enjoyed many a cup of coffee. Through tightly pressed lips she murmured, \" Have a nice day.\" I will not include here what I murmured through my tightly pressed lips as I turned and exited. BITTER coffee, BITTER experience. Shame on you, Dejeuner!"}
{"text":"We always come here or breakfast with the family when I'm in town. The restaurant is very pretty, the service is friendly and when it's not too busy they are very quick to bring your food.  Prices are very reasonable and servings are large. Food is yummy and even though we had a lot of notes to add to our orders (no butter in toast, hard boiled eggs boiled 12mins, etc) everything was as ordered and nothing needed to be sent back.  I always recommend this place if you are looking for breakfast in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Very salty and the serving is very slow...if you go there to eat you need to call because you gonna wait your order  for almost 45 minutes.."}
{"text":"Best in the west for breakfast, especially when nursing a hangover, if the wife is willing to pay, you can bet we're hitting up dejeuner!"}
{"text":"This place gets mixed reviews, perhaps timing is important, and what you order. I'd give it a \"just ok.\" The service is slow (took forever to get coffee... ordering/getting food was an epic wait). The food is just ok... a 2.5 stars. I ordered a standard eggs, bacon, potatoes. It was all pretty bland and the potatoes were sweet for some reason... which didn't work with the rest of the meal. However, the price is good and portions reasonable. You can eat a big meal for less that $10."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  My presence was never acknowledged and no table was offered even after waiting 15 minutes at the counter with no one ahead in line.  Fortunately, there are many other places nearby for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great good with great service. I can drive there on my lunch break and be in and out in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently moved to a spot across the street from their old location. The new location has a bright and modern look to it and the set up of the dining room is a lot better as the old location got noisy fast.   They have revamped and redone their menu with their new location. They still have the same classic breakfast fare, but have added a few lunch items. I had the chicken avocado burger which the waitress said was becoming a popular choice. It was good and I was surprised at the size of the grilled chicken breast, it was actually a full piece of chicken breast and not over cooked so it stayed nice and juicy. The fries were perfectly crisp without a greasy feel, and the presentation of the fries in the mini wire basket was super cute. They add a seasoning onto the fries which I could probably eat with a spoon  I also had the chicken and rice soup which was decent. My friend ordered the mushroom omelette from their lunch special menu and said she was very happy with it.   The service was great as well, the staff were all very friendly and paid special attention to make sure I didn't need anything else for my 1 year old."}
{"text":"The space where this wonderful restaurant now occupies used to be a Chez Cora. When they moved, Déjeuner Inc rolled right in. And I'm glad they did, because this place is FANTASTIC. The price is right the food is great and they give you a free meal on your birthday. I love coming here for breakfast and you will too!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place, I've been to much better brunch places. Too noisy, less than average customer service, prices are above average specially that they don't offer anything special. the taste of food is similar or less to any regular brunch place"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. It's probably one of the best breakfast places in an area not famous for good breakfast. I recommend it. You won't be blown away, but you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I have yet to be impressed. The service is slow and it is just too crowded and noisy. It is not a relaxing breakfast experience, that's for sure.  The food is okay. It isn't bad, but it isn't spectacular. I don't find the menu very original; there is nothing that would make me want to choose this place over any of the others around. The bacon is always cooked super crispy and just to my liking, at least!  The waitstaff is always very pleasant and kind, so they have that going for them."}
{"text":"Amazing place in the old location and now it's updated and a bigger space.  One of best spots in Montreal. You always know the place is run perfectly when the owner is working."}
{"text":"Go here for breakfast often.  Friendly quick service, can't go wrong.  But what's up with breakfast places serving weak coffee?  I'd pay extra for better coffee."}
{"text":"Just ok. Nice service. ..really overpriced. For 12$ there were exactly 3 tiny crumbs of bacon in my bacon cheese omelette.  Meh. The bacon on the side of the other plates were delish and well cooked as we're the potatoes."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place They are friendly they are proactive in there service and coffee refills.  The scrambled eggs with bacon was perfect with hot crispy potatoes with fresh fruit.  Everything we have tried has been hot and large portions . One of the staple place on the west island for breakfast-  good value  Only negative is that does get loud when they are busy"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. The owner is quick and seats you a couple of minutes after you come in, even if it is busy. The staff is fast, the food is fresh and there are just so many choices to choose from. The have recently moved and are located across the street from where they used to be. The new place is bigger and more modern, quality has not been compromised, it is still the best breakfast place on the west island, i highly recommend you try. The only problem is parking, it is still unpaved and space are not clearly indicated yet, however they just opened back up a month ago so i will give them time."}
{"text":"The portions are really good- really fills you up.  I enjoy their potatoes, especially when you dip in some ketchup and tabasco sauce for an extra kick.   The downside is that, both mine and my boyfriend's poached eggs weren't poached, in fact they cooked through the yolk. I can understand that poaching eggs isnt the easiest thing, fair enough i'll let that pass.   But my boyfriend found a hair on his pineapple  And i found a hair on my grapefruit.  Was our waiter nice and affective? Yes he was.  Was the food good? It was alright. Would i come back? No i wouldnt. Not after two failed poached eggs and one hair on each plate."}
{"text":"Français après  How can you miss pomme de terre risolé? By frying them! How can you miss Benedictine eggs ? By putting Mozzarella and Knorr Commercial Bechamel.  How can you miss pancake? (sorry americans) by doing american pancakes. How can you miss Waffles? By doing dry waffle mix. Now guess how many mistakes they do? ALL! AAALLL OF THEM!!  Comment tu peux manqué des pommes de terres rissolées? En les faisant frire. Comment manquer des oeufs bénédictine? En mettant du Mozzarella et de la sauce béchamel commercial en sachet. Comment râté des crêpes? En faisant des pancakes américaines. Comment manquer des gauffres? En faisant un mixte préfait.   Combien d'erreurs cette place font-ils? TOUTES TOUTES TOUTES!"}
{"text":"The breakfast we had there was nothing special. I ordered the french toast and eggs and neither was any better than I could make at home (and I'm not a very good cook). The waitress was very pleasant so it is not her fault but I did find that I was alway trying to wave someone down for coffee and water refills.  There was one server who was very rude when she brought my food. She brought the wrong thing and when I explained that what she gave me was not what I ordered, she glared at me like it was my fault. She then came back with the right plate and smacked it in front of me and left without a word. Very odd behaviour from someone working at a restaurant... Overall, I think there are much better brunch places in mtl."}
{"text":"The food is reasonably priced. Big portions and a diverse menu. The potatoes are delish and my kids love the pancakes. The staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely serves great food - better than Chez Cora.  However, it is very expensive.  The children's menu has huge portions, often $15-20 and the value is not as good as the adult menu.  I would still recommend this restaurant for excellent breakfast food, with good service."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite place for my son and I. We loved the old spot but the new one is even better. More modern and open. It is spacious and bright. Food is great as usual. Lots of choices available on the menu at a decent price. Service is excellent. You can usually find my son and I there on his ped days having brunch."}
