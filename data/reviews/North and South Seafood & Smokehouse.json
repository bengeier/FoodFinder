{"text":"Went again last night and we were not disappointed- wait for the table was worth it and service was great even though it was swamped. Riann was very helpful. The nachos...amazing! The crab legs were cooked perfectly and the best end to our night? Fried ice cream LOVE THIS PLACE :)"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a combined birthday and anniversary. Great experience! My family tends to be pretty picky when it comes to barbecue and seafood but everyone was simply delighted with their meals! The seafood is clearly fresh which is welcome change from most places. Seriously hit the spot and the Old Fashions on special were great as well. Wonderful service- can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good.  I haven't had the seafood yet, but btwn my husband and I we've had quite a bit of bbq and it has all been amazing.  Service has been super quick.   Planning on going back soon to try the Tuesday crab leg special!"}
{"text":"I have to give this restaurant mixed reviews.  It was PACKED when we were there - could barely carry on a conversation.  So, people clearly like it.  The busy atmosphere didn't take away from the experience at all.  The quality of food was very good, especially the pulled pork.  However, the flavors were lacking.  We shared the memphis pulled pork and the jambalaya.  The memphis pulled pork didn't have any flavor on it - literally at all.  There were no classic memphis spices.  It was just pulled pork.  I asked my waiter about it, and he assured me that it was memphis style, so, I left it at that.  But clearly, it wasn't right.  I don't know if they ran out and just served pulled pork instead?   The pulled pork itself, while a very good quality of meat, really didn't have much flavor to it.  I could only taste the faintest smoke on the edges.  The flavor never reached the middle, which was quite disappointing.  The texas toast clearly had some kind of butter or oil on it, but, you couldn't taste it.  It wasn't salted, wasn't sweet - it just sort of glistened.  The coleslaw was much too sweet - I took a bite and didn't finish.    The jambalaya was pretty much the same.  It looked great, seemed to have good ingredients.  But, it just didn't have any flavor.  There wasn't any cajun spice I could taste - it didn't even have enough salt.  It was just mildly sweet from the tomato sauce.  Truly, it wasn't offensive.  It just didn't really have anything memorable about it.  I get that people in the midwest are afraid of flavor, and it's hard to make spicy dishes that don't scare people away.  But, a jambalaya is where the flavor should really be front and center.  Especially when it's described in the menu as \"spicy\".  I think that some improvements could be made by simplifying the menu.  It's pretty big.  It's gotta be hard for the kitchen to handle so many different orders.  Probably pretty expensive, too.  By narrowing the menu down and really focusing on bringing the flavors out of key dishes (first and foremost, salt), I think it the offering could be pretty good.  But, for now, the quality is there, but the flavor is not."}
{"text":"If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. Nice, clean and welcoming restaurant. We are happy to have this place as an option in DeForest. Lots of delicious flavors!  The cornmeal catfish was amazing. The brisket was tender and tasty. The potato cakes are an interesting blend of hashbrowns and cheese, shaped and fried into a cake. The more I ate it, the better it got. I did have one issue with my food and when I mentioned it, the staff was prompt and polite about it. They handled it with class. Our server Erin was great! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! The atmosphere was updated and cozy. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. My catfish and pulled pork were delicious! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"North & South catered my outdoor family reunion this weekend and everyone loved it!!!  75 people of all ages raved about the pork, brisket, beans, mac & cheese, cornbread and they even brought all their different bbq sauces for everyone to try - bottom line the food was delicious and so family friendly!  North & South knows what they are doing when it comes to BBQ and making catering an event a worry free breeze.  Thank you so much for taking care of all the details and helping us make our reunion great!"}
{"text":"Sad to experience such a dud on the west side of Madison, especially since there are so few BBQ joints in the vicinity. Watery sauces with little distinction between them did nothing to enhance the flavorless pork. The Carolina mustard tasted like bulk French's with some additives.  Fried cod was decent but the coleslaw tasted pre-made by a vendor.  Hush puppies were good, actually.  The drinks were watered down and wretched. Stick to beer if you dare eat here.   The owners state in their menu that their method of cooking is authentic and if I have a problem with it then it is my problem.  Don't worry, I won't be back.  UPDATE:  The following is taken from the website. While it does not use the exact language I used above, it could be construed as a take-it-or-leave-it attitude by the chefs. After a really nasty response from the owner I thought I should clarify.   \"We are truly aiming for authenticity here. Not everyone will agree with our point of view on smoking and that's ok. This is the way we do Smokehouse, Barbeque, whatever you may call it, because we believe this is its true, authentic self. We enjoy making it, hope you enjoy eating it, and come back for more.\" http://eatnorthandsouth.com/smokehouse-info/"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for lunch. Here's a summary: Good food, great staff and customer service.  The details:  Our waiter was very outgoing, warm, and friendly. He made recommendations and knew the details of the menu very well. He checked on us a few times during our meal, and our water glasses were never empty.   We had Fried cheese curds to start. I believe they are made in house and per-breaded. They were good, but a bit too greasy for me.  Hubby had a combo of fried haddock and fried cod with a side of French Fries. it was a large portion of food and he liked how the fish was done. The batter was flavorful, but not overpowering of the fish.    I had the make your own lunch combo with grilled shrimp, grilled salmon with avocado orange salsa, and veggies. I also had the option of a side salad or soup. The starter salad was average: greens, a few veggies, and dressing. The shrimp were good, but a bit on the overcooked side. The vegetables consisted of a blend of broccoli, snow pea pods, red pepper and zucchini. These were seasoned and steamed. I was very impressed by the veggies as they were cooked to softness, but not mushy. The salmon was the crowning glory. It's very difficult to find salmon cooked to perfection. Most cook it too much and it becomes dry. This salmon was flaky and tender, yet not overdone. This is only the second place in Madison in 8 years where I've had salmon cooked properly! I wasn't a fan of the avocado orange salsa it was plated with. I tried the salmon with a few bites of the salsa and scraped the rest off. To me, the salsa taste was too overpowering of the salmon. I'd recommend asking for it on the side if you like a nicely seasoned, well cooked, but unadorned piece of salmon.   The overall atmosphere is warm and comforting and done in shades of red. The seating consists of a combination of booths and tables. The only issue I had is that our booth was right by a support pole that made it a bit difficult to get in and out of the bench (which was only open from one side). The bar looks very clean and neat and fits the ambiance well.  We enjoyed looking at the wall decorations, especially the diagrams of cuts by animal and the Anatomy of Good Bacon diagram.   We will definitely be stopping again to try some of the smoked items."}
{"text":"Excellent quality fresh and flavorful food for very fair prices. Excellent service. Nice atmosphere. Take out option. I actually contacted the owners and suggest that they set up another restaurant in another town in a different part of the county, and they listened! Now open, North and South Seafood & Smokehouse, DeForest, Wisconsin! I can hardly wait to come in again. My personal favorites are the variety shrimp kabobs and plank salmon, out of this world! You have GOT to try this place and experience it for yourself! Yum-o!"}
{"text":"PROS: Great seafood, great customer service, easy parking, clean dishwares / tables, \"bang for your buck\"  CONS: Wait-times can be long for groups 4+  I went with my girlfriend for dinner and we absolutely recommend the Tampa dish! Our server, Juliana, was very attentive and welcoming. This is a fantastic spot to bring your friends and loved ones! The entrees come with two sides, so they are usually more than enough to fill one person. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the food and service is always good!  I have tried many of their BBQ items and have not found any I don't like."}
{"text":"Don't let the location (in a strip mall) fool you. This place was awesome. Traveling through Madison, we stopped for dinner and were very impressed.  The atmosphere and food were great but the food was outstanding.  Pulled pork - awesome Meat loaf - amazing Side of coleslaw, baked beans, Mac and cheese, and fries were all wonderful.  Definitely would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Come in on a Sunday....happy hour all day! I had the Caprese app for a dinner. Excellent! Manu apps $1 off and great beer selection. Love the hush puppies and potato cakes."}
{"text":"Go-to place for barbecue in Madison. Large portion sizes for both entrees and sides - not always the case at barbecue restaurants! Both the brisket and pulled pork are always tender and you can taste the smoke. The mac and cheese is great and tastes homemade instead of from the box. Four choices of sauce at the table depending on your tastes. Service is always quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"Six for dinner Saturday night at 7:30 or so. Place was full. So waited 10 minutes at the bar and had great $4 Brandy Old Fashioneds. Two of us had the Lobster Bisque. Ok we are in Wisconsin, I wasn't expecting much. It was great! Smooth creamy and actually had Lobster in it! The other four salads. No complaints on the salads, simple side type salad. For our entrees we had a bit of a mix. I had ribs and coconut shrimp. I've read a lot of the reviews here about the ribs. Seems unfair to criticize when rib preparation preference is very wide. Personally I thought they were great! Did they fall off the bone? No but they shouldn't either. Some people like them like mush and that is fine but I'll take a little firmness. These ribs that night came off the bone clean with a slight tug. Great texture and dark smoky bark. Coconut shrimp were a tasty compliment. Others had catfish they really enjoyed. Not like in Texas with small curled pieces but actually corn meal battered filets. The pulled pork was awesome! Here too, not what you usually get with pulled pork. This was nice long strings with some texture, sauce free, with your choice of 4 on the table. Not that mashed up pile of meat buried in sauce that you can't tell what you are eating. Brisket beans were very good and meaty. Hush Puppies were straight out of the South, very good. The prices I thought were very reasonable. We were shocked how low our bill was for 6. We were out of there with two drinks each and 20% tip for under $190 and we were stuffed! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Brisket baked beans are incredibly tasty! We ordered tender prime rib and delicious brisket tacos with jalapeño slaw. The hush puppies were great too! Tried all of the bbq sauces and  the Carolina mustard at the table. Great experience, great drinks! Happy to have another option in DeForest! Excited to try their Sunday broasted chicken take-out and brunch at some point."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this place but ended up disappointed.    Very small portions.  The brisket wasn't very special."}
{"text":"Very good.  I had the pulled pork as usual with a new restaurant.  When it came out it looked dry.  I tasted it without adding sauce and it was not dry and very flavorful.   Adding one of their many sauces from the condiment rack made it even better.  I sided the pork with hush puppies and sweet potato fries.  I had thought it was a little pricy, but I got a lot of food.  My wife had the oriental wraps.  She liked those as well.  We both started out with the chowder.   I  thought it was going to be disappointing, but I had mixed all of the clams to the bottom of the cup."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time. It was wonderful.  Had the 3 piece cod with 2 sides. It was delicious.  The batter was thin and crispy, the fish was flaky and not soft or watery. Staff was great.  Will definitely go again. Next will try the crab legs !"}
{"text":"What can I say- Awesome! Loved the skillet corn bread!  First time having the crab cakes...will definitely have again!  Highly recommend the pulled pork and beer can chicken - moist, great flavor and loved the variety of homemade bbq sauces on the table - need to sell at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, even the 2 for 1 special.  Food comes out quickly is tasty and hot.   I have smoky chicken salad.   Lots of fresh greens, chicken chilled but tasty. Husband had perch.  3 nice sized pieces,  beer batter.   Very nice"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the food was pretty good. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place too! I'm not usually a seafood or a bbq sauce fan, so me giving this place 4 stars is kinda saying something! I got the Butterball (I think that's what it was called). It was turkey done two ways with a choice of two sides. The smoked (?) sliced turkey was a little dry, but the flavor was amazing. All in all I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a Friday night.  Luckily we used call ahead seating and were seated in about 5 minutes - busy night.  Four of us ordered four different things off the menu and all were very happy.  I ordered the beef brisket - great flavor but not a large portion.  Solid sides of mashed potatoes & hush puppies.  Great service & didn't rush us out to fill the table again.  Would recommend ..."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the end of the strip mall, but it is nice inside with plenty of room.  Food was fresh/tasted great, and excellent service.I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I had the Jambalaya, great flavor not to hot lots of chicken, Andouille Sausage  and shrimp. My wife had the pulled pork and chicken. She is from Texas and loved it. Great portions and two side dishes"}
{"text":"Great service - which is hard to find these days. Seriously our waitress was the best waitress I've had in a long time and I go out to eat a couple of times a week. Also has a great atmosphere. It's deceiving that it's in a strip mall. Food is simply okay. Nothing to write home about. Different than a lot of local joints so it has that going for it."}
{"text":"Service was great.  But two of us got food poisoning.  Never again."}
{"text":"Great options for food and drinks, the waitress was very friendly, and the food itself was delicious. I highly recommend the salmon options! We came in without a reservation on Mother's Day Sunday evening and waited about 30 minutes, so not too bad."}
{"text":"Better than most options in Deforest.  Sadly- it can depend on the day- how your food will turn out.  I was disappointed in the COLD brisket- cold meat is gross- asked for it re-warmed, they remade it but still-Cold- stick w the pork tacos. Mac n cheese & fried ice cream is excellent. Just can't give it more stars because of inconsistency in quality."}
{"text":"Best meatloaf I've ever had. We're very happy that we chanced upon this restaurant in our trip to Madison."}
{"text":"One of our new favorites.   The food is excellent and the staff are the greatest.  Even at the busiest times, they are amazingly friendly.  If you like bbq, this is the place to try."}
{"text":"Fantastic brisket and the fish fry is very good. The bar area is a bit cramped. Be sure to go early or call for a reservation as this place fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Unbelievably disappointing. I got the brisket and received 4 slices that had obviously been sitting in some type of warmer for more than a little while and 2 tiny sides. Having lived in Texas the claim that this is Texas BBQ is ridiculous. I am sorry to say that this was the worst brisket I have ever had. Dry, tough and tasted liked dried out roast.  My son had the pulled park which was not much better, dry and tough; much more like jerky than pulled pork. The only highlight of the meal, if you could call it that were his French fries.  Seeing some of the other reviews, they may have just had a really, really bad night but this would certainly be the last place in Madison I would go for BBQ."}
{"text":"After seeing four stars for this BBQ place I wanted to take a slab home when I left the Maddison area. The place is in a strip mall with 3 or 4 other restaurants in a heavy shopping area.  I called in for carry out carry out on my way home and I was told 10 to 15 which was ok. The full rack comes with two sides so I asked what the sides were and he rattled of about 12 different options so I chose Mac n cheese and brisket beans.  The place has a nice modern look with walls of color and exposed air ducts on the high ceiling. There is a cool salt water aquarium as you walk in. There is a small bar off to the side but everyone was in the tables eating.  The ribs looked good with a nice dark bark, see my pictures. The ribs were naked with sauce on the side so I could judge them, you have to ask for sauce on the side otherwise it's on the ribs. The ribs smelled smokey and had that nice red smoke ring. The ribs were not moist and tender nor did they fall clean off the bone. The bark was good with a peppery/hot finish. The texture of ribs were on the hard side and slightly dry, they probably were not made today. That being said I still liked them and when fresh out of the smoker they must be wonderful. The sauce was sweet, tangy with that same pepper/hot finish and I did put it on the ribs.  My sides were ok but nothing spectacular. The Mac n cheese noodles were not over cooked which I liked but the cheese sauce was just average with a pepper taste again, see my pictures. The brisket and beans were very tight and not watery in any way. It was very sweet and tangy with bits of brisket and better than the Mac.  Overall the the smoked ribs have potential and I didn't dislike my meal but if I were to get the ribs again I would ask when do they come out of the smoker and get right over to get them. The place is nice and the food is not bad but after having the BBQ power hitters, Smoque in Chicago and Papys in St. Louis to compare BBQ to I can only give three stars.  With that being said they have a good foundation for smoked BBQ ribs which was tasty and if they offered a fresh moist rack they could be BBQ greatness."}
{"text":"Been here twice with family. I think they do a great job on everything they do. My kids love the aquarium and the chicken and mac and cheese. They often have a great deal on beers or a dinner special. Everything they serve the do well. Also, the staff is friendly, attentive and good with kids."}
{"text":"Smoked Salmon was so good! My husband loved the crab legs and cheesecake, definitely will return while staying in the area!"}
{"text":"Outstanding smoked meats and seafood. I love the new menu, and the staff is fantastic. A real gem!!!  Best smokehouse meat I have had in Wisconsin and as good as I have had down south."}
{"text":"This is the first place I've ever decided to write a Yelp review about. We went last night for our anniversary dinner and couldn't have been happier! It is the perfect place to order some of the best BBQ we've had! The waitstaff was super friendly and they even surprised us with a free dessert for our anniversary! My husband had the prime rib and I had the brisket with coconut shrimp. Both plates were a good serving size and tasted great! You really have to appreciate a locally owned restaurant that truly cares about their customers experience. Looking forward to more visits!"}
{"text":"Came here looking for a new restaurant to try and left extremely satisfied!  We went on a Monday or a Tuesday (I can't quite remember) a week ago for lunch.  We got 2 for 1 very delicious Margaritas.  I ordered the $12 steak medallion lunch special, and was able to order two different sides along with it.  Medallions were perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were SO CREAMY AND DELICIOUS.  We also ordered the fried pickles for our appetizer and they were very crispy and flavorful.  I didn't have anything that I could put any of the sauces on, but I sampled them and they were delicious as well!  I will definitely come back to try the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Very good food! A very nice wide selection, it was hard to choose! Unfortunately the location is a bit cramped. I think they would do great in a larger building instead of where they are at right now."}
{"text":"Two of us stopped in on a Sunday afternoon while we were in the area. The place was relatively empty, but there was still about 5 or 6 other tables of people around when we were there. There is happy hour pricing on cocktails, wines, and beers on Sunday. This is a great special in case you are a little thirsty ; ).  Their pricing for both drinks and food are pretty reasonable on any day of the week. I ordered the fried and grilled shrimp meal. Both shrimps were good. I also tried my dining partners fried catfish and liked that as well. Even though I didn't order bbq, I did sample most of their house bbq sauces and I thought they were well made sauces. Our waiter was fine for most of our meal, but towards the end I felt that we were kind of rushed out. We were still finishing up the last bites of our meal when he brought out our check. He didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. I was kind of hoping to see the if they had a dessert menu, but I didn't get that opportunity."}
{"text":"Based on its strip mall location, you might not expect authentic Texas brisket, but this place knows how to do it!  Other smoked meats and fried seafood were also delicious."}
{"text":"Daily Smokehouse and bar specials! Try the brisket or the salmon from the smokehouse - you can think me later! Wide selection of sides to choose from and full bar. Small, family owned, fantastic service and friendly staff! I recently tried the nachos and was not disappointed! Friday fish fry, the coconut shrimp... all fabulous! Dine in or carry out, this place is amazing!! HIGH RECOMMENDATIONS!!!"}
{"text":"It was restaurant week, but we decided to try this place instead.   The atmosphere is a little stark, they tried to add some character with whiskey barrels and wood furniture, however the bright lights don't do the place any favors.   We shared the armadillo eggs, which were delicious and not too spicy. The smokey smokey chicken salad was huge and very flavorful. Lastly we had the Austin plate, we could not pick our favorite between the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs - they were all delicious!   The beer list was limited and I did not enjoy my wine. Next time we will try different beverages.   Their dessert menu was very tempting, but we were too full."}
{"text":"Just moved here and I've passed by this place a few times. Finally my wife and I decided to give it a shot. It looks great on the inside. Looks like if busy the size could be a issue but there wasn't really anyone there so didn't effect us. We're originally from Texas so we wanted to give the smoke house part of the menu a try. We got the Austin because that's where we're from and how could you not order something named for your home town. Unfortunately we we're extremely disappointed. The brisket and pork were so extremely dried out and flavorless. We couldn't believe it! There was no smoke ring in the meat that we could see so where's the smoke house aspect coming from? The ribs were ok. They definitely had a smell to them that I couldn't put my finger on. I'll be willing to give this place another shot and try the seafood side of the menu. It definitely seems like this is a seafood place that trys to sell BBQ. If you're going for the 1st time I would stick to the seafood side for sure because the bbq here does not pass this Texans quality test at all."}
{"text":"My friend from North Carolina was in town and I knew we had to try this place out. I had visited the west side location a few times, and was a fan, so I figured it was the perfect place as my friend's last meal in Wisconsin....  It definitely did NOT disappoint! The food was incredible. We shared 2 orders; Yazoo ribs with firecracker shrimp with sides of brisket beans and potato cakes and Galveston brisket with coconut shrimp and sides of fries and Mac and cheese; and cheese curds to start. My friend was in LOVE with the cheese curds (with his Spotted Cow), he couldn't get enough. We split everything, and Our food smelled as incredible as it tasted. The brisket was served over Texas toast and was so tender and melted in my mouth, the ribs fell off the bone, and mixed with the sides and the shrimp... basically it was a happy dance in our mouths.  Our waitress was very energetic and pleasant, and the ambiance was very chill. It was never too quiet or too noisy, and luckily we got there early, as I'm guessing it can get pretty packed. We'll definitely have to stop in again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the snow crab. Was ok but not great. I guess it would be nice to have snow crab legs that was better than red lobster. My wife had the 3 choice fish. Was very good. I love their corn rolls."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza, the surprisingly large interior with high ceilings feels crafty, bright, and family-friendly. We stopped by around 7:00 pm on a Sunday, hoping to get another taste of the delicious ribs and brisket I had at a recent catered event by them. Beware, the specials and popular items go quick, especially on a nice day. Since they smoke meats in limited quantities, everything I planned to order was out by the time we arrived. Bummer!   But when life hands you lemons, you channel your inner Beyonce. I went for their pulled pork and catfish entree instead, and I need to express to the Internet how amazing their catfish is. It is zero fishiness, juicy on the inside, crispy, fluffy, and salty on the outside. It didn't need the tarter sauce that came with it. Not normally a huge catfish fan, I would not hesitate to recommend this one to any fish eater, or order this one myself again.   I was disappointed by their BBQ sauces though, what had been great at the event I attended, now tasted much too sweet on my pulled pork -- I'm not sure if they're working with a different recipe or what -- so I took my pork to go and it made great next-day leftovers with the TJ's BBQ sauce I had at home.   Two sides come with your entree, and I chose the mac n cheese and coleslaw. As a lover of cafeteria mac n cheese, their cheese-saucey version with large corkscrew macaroni worked great. What was crunchy fresh coleslaw at the catered event I attended tasted more like its store-bought cousin in-house, but my partner loved it.   Their key lime pie is a generous slice for $5, definitely a nice finish to a meal split between two or more people.   I would love to come back, but maybe a little earlier to make sure I can get that BBQ or beer can chicken special! North and South, see you again soon."}
{"text":"We had enjoyed the former Joey's in this space and were interested to see what North & South was all about after reading the mostly glowing Yelp reviews.  The space was updated with dark chocolate brown colors, but N&S still had Joey's huge boat mural on the far wall and the fish tank by the entrance.  We started out with the cornbread. Just so everyone knows, this is the Northern kind, which has a cake consistency and a sweet taste. Some people love cornbread like this, I'm not a fan. It was served warm in a single round large piece with butter on the side. The waitress brought some packets of honey to go with it. I think if I were to get this again, I would spring for the jalapenos and cheddar to cut the sweetness of the bread.  As most reviewers have indicated, our waitress was wonderful. She anticipated our every need without us hardly having to ask.  The Birmingham is the pulled pork on a slice of Texas white toast along with a large piece of cornmeal coated catfish. I can see why the other Yelper's were raving about the catfish. It was perfectly done and not the least bit greasy. The pile of pulled pork could have been a little bigger, but along with the two sides, it is more than enough food for just about anyone.  The brisket is nicely done, with the all important burnt, black edges on the meat to give it more flavor. As great as the meat portions were, some of the sides could have used a little help. The BBQ baked beans had an intense smoky flavor that blotted out the other flavors, which was something I wasn't used to. The mac and cheese was terrific, creamy cheese and firm corkscrew noodles. The slaw is made by hand, but it was nothing special, in my opinion. We finished off the very fine meal with a slice of the Key Lime pie which was wonderfully tart. My companion has been raving about the great cup of coffee he had with the dessert days later after we had our meal at North & South.  One final word about the space, it is very comfortable with booths and tables, but just like Joey's, if every table is filled, the noise level could be deafening. If this matters to you, you might want to go during an off time."}
{"text":"Smoked meat, great curds, good drinks.  I would recommend plus I hear they are starting a Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"My family and I had brunch here this morning. We loved it! Everything from the smoked brisket to the crab legs was all freshly prepared and made from scratch. The service was great and I felt like they did a great job with the setup and the environment of the restaurant. We we're extremely impressed and we'll definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"So I had to try this place again after getting catered from North and South at a special event. I really loved the fact you can get meat by the pound for take out. This really makes it easy.  I got a pound of brisket and a pound of pulled pork along with some sides of cole slaw and mac and cheese. The pulled pork was very good. It had a great smoky flavor similar to some great southern places that I've been to. The brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender and just absolutely delicious.  Most of the time, the sides are just an after-thought. But, the mac and cheese was also incredibly delicious. It tasted like a made-from-scratch homemade mac and cheese.  I would definately recommend this place if you're in the mood for BBQ. It is one of the best places in Madison!"}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first time looking to try something new in the Madison area. We were very happy with our visit.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the Saturday cocktail special $4 rail old fashions. My boyfriend got the Saturday special smoked prime rib 24oz with a salad and macaroni and it was all amazingggggg and delicious. I got the brisket sliders... and the hype is real. You need to try their brisket, it was so delicious it was unreal with their selection of BBQ sauces.  Go here and enjoy lots of different options and good drinks!"}
{"text":"We tried North and South Seafood & Smokehouse prior to a movie last week. It was a good experience all around. The atmosphere is casual but appropriate for a date. Service was prompt and friendly but not pushy.  The food was a few dollars more than I might have hoped for, but very, very tasty. We had the tilapia baked with crab stuffing in a parmesan crust with a garlic cream sauce. We also had the Lafitte which was fried in cornmeal with cajun shrimp and included smoked bacon in a cream sauce. Our sides were the hush-puppies and wild rice pilaf which were also perfectly prepared. They had a number of bar-b-que options which sound great and I look forward to trying in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice atmosphere. Great service.  We were devoted to Famous Dave's for bbq and went here for the seafood. If you're straight up bbq FD's family platters can't be beat. However I would give N&S the edge because of their seafood options. We got a nice variety and everything was great. The sides were fantastic. I got the pork/cod/halluck combo. The price was appropriate. The fish tank near the entrance is beautiful. Nice bathrooms, it was clean and the parking lot was easily managed. The men's room has some pretty clever bbq decor up on the walls. Not five stars because no free dessert for my wife's birthday."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here since it was Joey's Seafood and was pleasantly surprised! I've had appetizers and both smoked meat and shrimp - all were great! I eat a restricted diet (Keto) and they had plenty for me to choose from! My friend REALLY liked the cornmeal crusted catfish.   Decor is still quite \"Joey's\" but who cares - you don't eat the walls. :)."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This is a fantastic place with great service and exceptional food! Who knew that BBQ and seafood could work, these folks did. Finally, the old fashioned with both brandy and Southern Comfort was absolutely delicious! Nice work! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"No nonsense, great food. Every visit this place has delivered. The meats are so damn flavorful and the house made bbq sauces are fantastic. The New England clam chowder is bomb as hell (love me some good chowda). And the $4 specials on rail old fashioneds (bourbon, sour, not sweet) are awesome. Love living down the street from some great BBQ!"}
{"text":"A wonderful surprise hidden away in a strip mall in Madison. I literally stumbled across this place while looking for my hotel. The food was, across the board, excellent. The smoked brisket was tender, smoky, and had very little fat. The side orders were equally good, and the spicy whisky sauce was an excellent accompaniment. Jesse, my bartender/server, was incredibly attentive but never intrusive.    Overall, a great experience, and the food was substantially superior to some of the more well-known BBQ chains in this part of the country. I would absolutely come back the next time I am Madison."}
{"text":"We've been there for lunch, dinner and brunch. Excellent food and service each time! Reasonable prices for the quality/quantity. Checking out the fish fry tonight."}
{"text":"Crab cakes were to die for!  We had the special 20 shrimp!  Yummy!  Sat at the bar!  Excellent service!  Thank you!  Can't wait to try the pulled pork and chicken!  Return visit required!"}
{"text":"We used to come pretty frequently when it was Joey's. When they changed over to North and South, we were a bit apprehensive about the addition of bbq and stayed away. It took a Yelp event to introduce us to the owners and the ways and whys of North and South. It was great  talking with them about what's new and learning about the cooking processes. We decided to try it out again after tasting their amazing St Louis ribs. We loved eating the ribs so much, I wanted to get a smoker. But why bother, when you can save time by ordering by the pound! I've never been much of a ribs person, but the entire family goes ga-ga over the ribs. It's like a \"don't you dare touch my leftovers\" kinda feeling after eating here. The waitress/hostess we had was pretty awesome too. Her positive attitude and the info she provided about menu items made it a comfortable environment for us. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very impressed. Ordered the Kansas full rack of ribs and a side order of brisket. All of our food was phenomenal and our server Kent was prompt and friendly.  I highly recommend the brisket it was the best thing I've ever eaten in my damn life.  I will be coming back here often !!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at this establishment. Went here for the 1st time today for brunch. The staff was nice and attentive as well as friendly. The food was on a higher level. Most of the dishes incorporated one of their smokehouse items. Deforest needs a place like this so I hope they stick around. The prices are a touch high but not outrageous so it seems worth it. I'll definitely be ordering a pound of the brisket soon for just myself!"}
{"text":"This is a well known restaurant that has been in Madison for a little while. The customer service is excellent. The time it took to be seated excelled our expectations. They were short staffed but still and still provided stellar service. The food was cooked to perfection and had a great temperature. The cheese curds, the firecracker shrimp, the ribs, the oriental tacos, the cat fish, the pulled pork, the sweet potatoe fries, the hush puppies, the seasonal veggies, the Mac and cheese, the brisket baked beans...EVERYTHING was amazing. I will definitely be back, and tell all of my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, cold beers and incredible staff. Can't ask for more, a fantastic place to eat. The Gumbo is out of this world !!!"}
{"text":"My bf and I were going to be in Madison for a concert so we got on Yelp because being from New Orleans, one of the many things I miss is authentic southern bbq and man am I glad we found this place.   My bf had the Austin which is a combo of pulled pork, ribs and brisket and  mashed potatoes and a cup of chili as his sides and he pretty much cleaned his tray except for a small piece of the pulled pork. I had the Texas brisket, fatty please with mac n' cheese and bbq brisket beans as my sides and what I did eat was amazing and the rest got loaded up into a go box to take back home.   We were greeted and waited on by Jessie who was sweet as can be and an awesome server. We were also impressed that the owner Keith took the time to come out and talk to us not only about the food but also about us, personally.   The bf and I have gone to Taste of Madison the last 3 years and we'll be on the hunt for the North and South booth while we're there this year to see what they'll be serving up and get some.   I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for authentic southern bbq because this place nails it. I actually packed up my lunch for work today last night when we got home and warned the bf to stay away from the rest that's in the go box in the fridge because I love me some great fatty brisket and their's is RIGHTEOUS."}
{"text":"First time there tonight. We were greeted right away and seated in a comfortable booth. We both had the 1 1/2 crab legs for 20.00. Monday night special. Had the hush puppy's and cole slaw. All was delicious. My friend had sweet potatoe frys and a side salad.  Our waiter Rian was great!  Really on top of things. Kept my drink full and didn't have to ask for anything!! I love it when I have a professional wait staff!!  It was relaxing and I fully enjoyed it.  I really like this place and can't wait to go back to try the other items."}
{"text":"Came with my wife and two children of 9 and 6yo. We're pleasantly surprised with the ambiance and menu selection.  The menu is huge!  We shared the smoked chicken and brisket nachos and armadillo eggs (jalapeño with a creme cheese and chive filling, wrapped in bacon, and smoked). Amazing!  Tortilla chips were freshly fried and thin/crisp, the meat was plentiful and a perfect blend of onions, jalapeño slices and tomatoes in a light qeuso sauce.  I had the Yazoo entree,(ribs and grilled shrimp. Both were great, shrimp not rubbbery, ribs had a nice bark, and great flavore) wife had Chipotle fish tacos (she enjoyed), and kids had crab legs and  chicken tenders. Crab legs were flavorful, and fyi, the chicken tenders are hand breaded in a beer batter type of mix, and are a premium cut of chicken.  Service by Molly was perfect. Prices good.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"It was a very busy Saturday night and not much room in the bar/waiting area, but we got a table after not too long of a wait. Our waiter was a bit stressed out and didn't get our order in right after he took it, but he owned up to it, apologized profusely, and comped us our drinks... which we're very good by the way!! The smokehouse pork and chicken were both very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"We love barbecue, and this is the best barbecue that we've had by a long shot.  This place has a ton of different proteins, including salmon, turkey, chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and ribs.  We tried everything except the salmon and ribs, and it was all delicious.  They have a way of smoking the meat that permeates further than other barbecue joints that results in pure deliciousness.  The Mac n cheese was creamy, and the potato cakes with onion and cheese were crunchy and flavorful.  My daughter had popcorn shrimp off the kids menu, and it was perfect for her.  Definitely a must if you're in Madison!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! Not only was the food great but the service was outstanding! As a single mom, taking 2 kids out to eat is sometimes stressful. The staff here made all of our experiences enjoyable. Good food+great staff=fantastic restaurant! Kudos and thank you for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Great food, good pricing, comfortable seating, and excellent service. Can't wait to enjoy another meal here."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at North and South after hearing from our friends that the BBQ was good.  It is definitely good.  My husband had a rack of ribs and  they were outstanding!  I had the Friday fish special that was just so so however I got the mashed potatoes and I can honestly say they were the most flavorful mashed potatoes I've ever had in a restaurant.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant itself was clean and nicely decorated.  However, there seemed to be a bit of an identity crisis going on.  Are they a seafood restaurant or a BBQ joint?  Based on the food, they should stick to BBQ!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Amazing .  When I go out, I try to order things I don't normally make at home.  To that end, I ordered the Charleston Shrimp n grits (with vegetables and potato cakes).  I was blown away.  This was delicious.  The grits were so rich (with the bourbon bacon jam soaked in); the shrimp  was great (good flavor and texture); no complaints.  I don't post much on Yelp, but part way through the meal, I knew I had to post this.  Go to North and South.  Order this dish."}
{"text":"Not ready to comment on food yet. Very disappointed in menu. NO LUNCH PORTIONS! Just full price entrees. Ordered soup. \"Does bread come with that?\" A shake of the head no. Don't think I'll be back for a bit. I can understand  why they're empty for a Saturday lunchtime."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and have had success both times. Without a doubt the brisket is TO DIE FOR, so if you can't decide what to get on the menu, get that. We will be eating here again.  The first time I had the Boise, A Salmon covered with cheesy potato goodness. This last time I had the brisket and coconut shrimp. My husband ate the Denali, salmon with an avocado salsa, it was cooked perfectly, seasoned very well and tasted great.  The hostess this last time was also one of the owners. We really like this place because of how local it is; food that they make in their kitchen at home they bring to the restaurant.   The one complaint I have about this place is how cold it's been every time I've been here. They had a heater in the corner last time."}
{"text":"A huge fan of Joey's Seafood, I was worried about the change to North and South.  How could a restaurant double their menu and maintain their quality?  Well, they did!  I've continued to enjoy the good seafood, especially their Monday Night crab legs special, shrimp, and hush puppies, and I finally broke down and tried brisket from their smokehouse menu. It was delicious!  I enjoyed their sweet barbecue sauce, too. I'm still a fan!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is absolutely awesome. You must try the catfish and the perch is to die for!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while passing through town for dinner.  I got the brisket and shrimp for dinner - I've never had brisket soo good before! Hands down the best brisket I've ever had, the flavor was great and it just melted in my mouth.  My father said the pulled pork was some of the best he has had too.  Meatloaf was good not great.  Good selection of local brews on tap. Ambiance was OK, staff was friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place and would want to come back if we are in Madison again."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I had the brisket sandwich for lunch, and I loved it.  It was very juicy and flavorful.  Maybe it could use another kiss of smoke, but I can't complain.  It was much better than the pulled pork sandwich I had previously reviewed from the Madison location.  The only slight negative is their use of HFCS in their sauces."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch the other day, and, honestly, I was disappointed.  I had the pulled pork sandwich.  There were two problems.    First, it was the smallest pulled pork sandwich I've ever had.  There was more bun than meat.  That's just not what I expect in a pulled pork sandwich.    Second, I got very little smoke flavor from the pork.  It pretty much tasted like pulled roast pork.  Maybe I just got unlucky and all my meat came from the interior, with no bark.  But whatever, I didn't really like the taste.  On the plus side, the sauces were very good.  I especially liked the Spicy Whiskey.  My waiter was attentive.    I will go back, because most reviewers seem to like this place.  Maybe I just got unlucky.  Or maybe I'm a BBQ snob.  My next visit will tell me which it is."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Deforest, excellent food & great staff. We have been here about 5 times and tried something new each time , never been disappointed. Prime rib is amazing  , blue cheese burger is awesome , Kids  chicken tenders & Mac and cheese is not average."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in for lunch to try the new menu. I had the combo lunch of pulled pork and pulled chicken. But first, came the brisket chili; and wow, what a chili. Traditional spiciness hits first, and then comes the sweet, followed shortly by a little heat. Keith, one of the owners, acknowledged the sweetness and (rightfully) wouldn't disclose what it is! The pulled meats arrived on beds of buttery, grilled Texas toast accompanied by cole slaw. The meats stood on their own with definite hints of smoky flavor. Of the four proprietary sauces at the table, I tried and liked Keith's spicy whiskey sauce the best, although I recommend trying all of them to find your favorite. Erin (sp?), the other owner stopped by to ask about my meal and remembered me from before they switched. I told her they are definitely doing something right by adding smoked meats to the menu. My server Chad was great, attentive, and would gladly ask for him again. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A friend requested BBQ on the West Side. Found this on Yelp & glad we did. Good food. Good service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a lark, craving BBQ. I was not disappointed. The turkey breast was smoky, herbacious and moist and topped off with a tasty bacon jam. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her coconut shrimp as well. I would come back again tomorrow to keep trying the different smoked meats and sauces."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with excellent service. I had the catfish with mashed potatoes and hush puppies. Very tasty and good flavor in the cornmeal batter. Our waitress Carrie was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. Although it's a cool place with lots choices our food was not the best.  Ribs were overdone and covered with a thick red sauce that was way over the top. Salmon was cooked ok but very salty. I usually associate this level of salt with hiding a bad taste. Tacos were very big but not memorable. Liquid was running out the bottom while my partner was eating them. Not sure what that was about but wouldn't order them again. The haddock special was good but served poorly. It was six perch sized fillets on a plate without any garnish. If they would put them in a little boat with drawn butter and a little parsley it was have been much better. This was the baked version. I have never seen haddock in small pieces like this and have my doubts whether it was indeed haddock. It is a big fish and usually served in a large piece rather than these small fillets. Could be I guess. They were good tasting and cooked perfectly. This sides were much better. Mashed potatoes with the skins on was a big portion and very good as was the coleslaw. It was  a very small cup of the coleslaw. Cornbread was excellent, don't miss it. Beans were above average. I would go back here just to try some of the other items on the menu. Lots of good choices and hopefully better ones than what we got. The service was very good, no complaints there at all.  Still big crowds so forget the bar at prime time. We went down the street to O'Gradys for a drink while waiting for our reservation. A very pleasant place and only a couple of blocks away."}
{"text":"I reluctantly came back to this place after my initial mediocre experience. It does have some of the best brisket in the west end for sure if not the entire city. I recommend the smokehouse brisket salad. It is healthy and decadent on the same plate. I am also glad that they take Discover credit cards. All in all I am now a fan. Maybe my next time will be a 5 star visit!"}
{"text":"Brisket and pulled pork are absolutely delicious !! Service is wonderful! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every Saturday this restaurant has smoked Prime Rib. Oh YES. My dining companions were both swooning and so happy with this smoky, tasty, juicy meat. Get this beef- but go early because I hear they can run out. I have also tried their yummy brisket, the ribs and the pulled pork. The kitchen here knows what it is doing with meats. They have several sauces to try if you want embellishment. Ex. smokey whiskey sauce!  NOTE- Save room for a piece of Key Lime Pie!!!! I am very picky about pie in general and crust in particular. The graham crust is perfect, crunchy and not too thick. The Key Lime filling is also perfect. Tangy and sweet, but not too sweet, and creamy- not at all gummy like many cafe pies.  They have beer, wine and a full bar. Bathroom- women's - was large and sparkling clean. The location is in a small strip mall in West Madison -  easy to find- worth the trip if you love good food."}
{"text":"The outside. *sigh* Why must such a great place be in a strip mall?? Sorta weird if you ask me. But I guess never judge a book by its cover. I probably would never have the desire to pop in if it wasn't for friends raving about this place. And sheesh you walk in and it's great!! Updated, nice waiting area and fun looking bar area. Anyways - all of us at our table got either the pulled pork or chicken. The conclusion: don't waste your time with the chicken, just GET THE PORK. It was so moist and had great flavor and each of their sauces are really different. The chicken to us was nothing special. And like all good BBQ places they had lots of sides to choose from and all were great that we tried - veggies (surprisingly really nice and fresh!), fries, beans and Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"I tried this place on the advise of a friend. I have  read many of the 3 and 4 star reviews here and was shocked to what I found. Are people really that ignorant of what good ribs and seafood are? Apparently the average person has never been outside of a Walmart grocery... So here is my take. If you enjoy TGIF's then you won't need to read any further, this place will be heaven for you. Stopped in for lunch and had the Coconut Shrimp for $11.It included a small bowl of Italian soup straight out of Campbell's kitchen circa 1950. The shrimp were worse than the kind you get in the frozen section at Walmart. Overcooked, gummy, small and pathetic. I much prefer the frozen grocery store type. The breading was thick brown and nasty, also overcooked. Yes it tasted like Coconut, but really anything contains Coconut does. I've had this dish many times in many different locales, and this was the worst by far. But my friend insisted it was a great place.. So, I thought maybe I need to try the ribs. So back I went with a different friend. We ordered a shrimp app and the ribs with cornbread. I don't mind the Kansas City style ribs and there were 3 sauces on the table to choose... but...The spicy wasn't spicy, the smoked sauce lacked much smoky flavor... The other I decided to ignore as the disappointments we're adding up and up. Then the ribs came out.... very dry, poor quality meat. The cornbread was OK but not memorable. I kept asking myself why do they even bother with a menu that fails in both of its main categories? Why have a sign that advertises \"Cape Hatteras tuna, etc when you don't offer them??? Are they hoping it will trick people into believing this a real seafood restaurant? How desperate are they? I never visited Joey's seafood which was the former name of this place, but I have to believe it was better than this. In fact I bet the sign is a leftover from better times. The staff is very nice, but then comes the bill with a marketing trick: A sealed envelope with a promise of ten to 100 percent off IF you wait to open it next month in the restaurant. Well if you need to create that much drama to get somebody to come back to your restaurant what does that say about your food? Other questions ran through my mind, are you just undercapitalized and can't afford quality seafood or ribs? Prices are way to high for this level of dining. My advise to the owners: Madison will not support this type of \"quisine\" for very long. I always feel bad writing a terrible review because I realize how hard it is to make it in the restaurant business. It's nearly impossible. Many good restaurants fail for reasons beyond their control, but with product like this it's hard to see a reason for thier existence in competitive market like Madison. My advise: Go North or go South but avoid this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best barbecue restaurants you will encounter. I recently had family in town from Louisiana and they agreed that is quality BBQ. The food is good but the brisket is special. You will not find better brisket anywhere. Well done!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new dinning experience in town an alternative to Applebee's. So we stumbled across North and South, we walk in and were pleasantly greeted and seated in a booth within minuets. The decor was nice and felt great ambiance. Pleasantly surprised of Wednesday night BOGO FISH cod special, We were served fairly quickly. I couldn't believe they had hush puppies I have not had them in forever. Yes so tasty too....We tried the mini corn bread and I had baked brisquet beans and French Fries. I have to say that I am a big fan of fish cod fillets and this was superb. The fish was crispy yet soft on the inside. I am so happy I stumbled in, I believe I found my new favorite dinning for Fish Friday. I can't wait to try their other entrees on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I loved this place in Madison when it was Joey's and then when it became North and South. Moved to DeForest and found it harder to get over there...like magic, they opened in DeForest. Awesome drinks and great specials. I love the Firecracker Shrimp. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and good food. Sort of crowded, but it was a Friday night, so a bit expected. Hope to go back for the southern food. We had seafood and it was great, especially the crab cakes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary. We each got a combo platter and it did not disappoint. You were able to add on 4 oz portions of meats for $5 so we were able to try a little of everything. The brisket and ribs are out of this world. Brisket had a nice salty edge and wasn't too fatty. Fries were good, but the mac and cheese was to die for! The hush puppies were top notch. The table had 4 house made sauces: Carolina Mustard, St. Louis Syle, Smokey Smokey, and Spicy Whiskey. I really enjoyed the Spicy Whiskey And Smokey together.  They also have daily specials.  I was glad to see that they sell their smoked meats by the pound. I will definitely be getting some brisket takeout soon!"}
{"text":"Went here to try the brunch. Boy were we in for a great surprise.  The food was delicious, there was a cocktail shrimp appetizer. So many entrees to choose from. The prime rib was tender and had an amazing bark, smokehouse hash which was so full of flavor with tender chunks of brisket, potatoes and peppers topped off with eggs.    Snow crab legs and crabcake benedict which were both delish.  One of my favorite dishes was shredded brisket over cornbread topped with a poached egg absolutely amazing. The corn bread was so sweet and moist I could have eaten a whole pan.  For dessert they had choices of cheesecake from butterscotch, chocolate and strawberry.  And that's just the food the ambience was nice, typical of a more upscale smokehouse or barbecue restaurant.  All of the staff were very friendly and helpful eager to answer any questions. We will be back."}
{"text":"The ribs were meaty and well smoked.  They have four different sauces, three red sauces (sweet, spicy, smoky) and a mustard based sauce.  All the red sauces tasted pretty much the same, and they were all very sweet, and not particularly smoky or spicy.  The brisket baked beans were excellent. The staff were very friendly and the beer selection on tap is all local."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice now. Tried it as Joeys Seafood and again when they rebranded it as its new name. Waitress we had was polite and friendly but food quality and consistency continues to be a struggle. Wont go back again."}
{"text":"Very good food, fabulous service, thank you Matthew, had a great lunch today. Reasonable prices, a great addition to DeForest"}
{"text":"I love the food!  A little pricey but worth it.  I miss Joey's but am glad North & South is there.  I can't decide, being from the south, where I want to visit and try something different half the time. Pulled pork is my fave, my son brisket, a friend mussels.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Madison isn't quite the the seafood capital of anything so it's pretty tough to find a decent seafood place here. North and South does a good job of providing higher quality seafood and is priced very well. I wouldn't mind a having few more menu options but what they have is good. I look forward to many more visits!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I mean I definitely appreciate this place and their focus on pairing BBQ and seafood but the menu feels a bit schizophrenic and the food is just ok. On our recent visit, I had the ahi tuna tacos which were good but not mind blowing - the fish was fresh and well prepared but the fixins' (predictable wasabi mayo) was nothing to write home about.  My husband had a pulled pork sandwich that was well...a pulled pork sandwich.  Atmosphere and service was good, no complaints there.  It feels a tad overpriced too.  I'm happy to see this place is doing well - I probs won't be heading back anytime soon though."}
{"text":"3 1/2 ** Service was good, waitress was very nice to my 1 year old son. The bbq sauces are delicious, food wasn't bad. Had pulled pork and threw on the yummy sauce which made it that much better. Hoping to see their sauces bottled.. I would buy. Would return."}
{"text":"I visited here when it was Joey's Seafood and was great.  I visited here when it was Joey's Seafood and was terrible.  I vowed to never give them another chance, but then my wife's job ordered catering from there.  North South is better than Joey's was before the change.  Some of the BBQ is good to great, some of it is restaurant BBQ (as opposed to from a legit BBQ restaurant).  The best BBQ option by far is the brisket.  Ribs arent bad but are nothing to write home about.  My wife likes the crab cakes.  The shrimp and grits are not authentic.  I really wanted some shimp and grits, but they disappointed.  My friend and I had the clam chowder, he thought it was amazing, I thought it was ok."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for lunch time today.  I arrived before the lunch crowd, which, by the way, they do fill up even on Tuesdays.  That was as encouraging as the good reviews they've received.  Asked what I'd like to drink, I started by ordering a raspberry tea (fountain drink).  This may be an odd way to start a review, but I mention this for a good reason.  My cup never saw the ice settle on the bottom.  I don't think it dropped below half-full while I was there.  I started with a cup of clam chowder.  I was informed that it was homemade.  It arrived hot, creamy, and good for the soul.  At over 4 bucks a cup, I had hoped to see hearty pieces of clam versus minced clam bits.  Nevertheless, it was tasty and I could very easily see myself ordering this again on my next visit.  For lunch I ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  The platter included french fries, coleslaw, and a pickle slice.  The first thing that took me by surprise was how mountainous the sandwich was.  I even mentioned it to my waitress.  Be prepared folks; they don't skimp on the meat.  The sandwich does not include any additional fixings - no ubiquitous lettuce, onion, or tomatoes here.  Quite frankly, it would detract from the pork anyway.  This, I can only assume, was intended to be a man versus meat experience!  Well...sort of.  The bun was buttered and toasted on the grill.  I actually enjoyed the bun.  It did a wonderful job holding the meat, and brought its own, separate layer of flavor to the sandwich.  The meat was a little on the dry side, but, otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed it down the very last bite.  The mayo-based coleslaw was fantastic.  Too many BBQ places have sides that are forgetful.  The coleslaw was perfectly seasoned and hit on another flavor note.  I picked up a refreshing acidic component that added perkiness to an already excellent side.  The french fries were seasoned and cooked to perfection.  They were hot and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  This was something they also did not skimp on.  The tables included a quad of BBQ sauces to enjoy.  I tried them, but, sadly, none of them really wowed me.  The Carolina Mustard too closely resembled Gulden's brown mustard to my taste buds.  I found the Spicy Whiskey sauce to be bland and tame.  Smoky Smoky was smoky, but, it lacked something to really make it stand out.  Of the 4 sauces, their Kansas City Sweet was by far my favorite.  I squirted ample sauce atop the mound of meat as well as along the bitten areas of the sandwich.  The service was OUTSTANDING.  This is an element I watch with raptor-like eyes.  I absolutely marvel at waitstaff who just knock it out of the park, and the folks at N&S hit a grand slam with me.  Serious kudos!!  I know I've only made a single trip here, but it made an impression worthy of being mentioned so highly.  All other eateries should seriously look at their paradigm.  Anyone employed (or thinking of employment) in the service industry looking to up their game ought to visit simply to take notes and, maybe, grab a delicious bite.  Having experienced a taste of the \"North,\" I look forward to the \"South\" during my next visit, finger firmly pointing at the source of my eagerness.  Jambalaya!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Such a nice addition to deforest. Not the cheapest place to eat, but normal priced for a sit down restaurant with good food! I had the clam chowder soup which was amazing! Fiancé had chili which he said was great also. Then I did the snow crab legs, they were great with a side of mac and cheese. Fiancé had the jambalaya and enjoyed it. We would definitely go back again! But of course only for probably a once a month thing since it is pricier, but al was worth it! They did also have like cheaper burger options and stuff so not everything is pricier, but if you want the good stuff you'll spend the money!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and every meal has been delicious! The fried pickles are phenomenal, ribs and chicken are juicy and tender, and you can't beat Two Pound Tuesday's. They also have a rockin' Sunday brunch buffet with the traditional favorites and a few unique items. I love their twist on eggs Benedict complete with a cornbread base and brisket. On top of the great food not having to go into Madison for a good quality BBQ is definitely a plus too."}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered there has been great. Love the sauce choices. Ordered out their smoke chicken and loved it. Great place while I lived in the area, but wanting to go back soon."}
{"text":"Our first visit to the DeForest location was great - lots of fun at the bar with Peter, serving up some fine margaritas and Oktoberfest Bier.  For years we have enjoyed Keith & Erin's delicious servings dating back to Joey's and their Westside of Madison location of North & South's Seafood and Smokehouse, so we had high expectations for their new location.  They certainly delivered in DeForest - warm hospitality, friendly staff, and delicious food.  Our table enjoyed the ahi tuna salad with wasabi sauce, fish sandwich and cheese curds, shrimp tacos with the sirachi sauce on the side, and a rack of ribs.  Our server did a great job and the food was delicious - \"one of the best fish sandwiches ever\", I overheard at the table.  My ribs were tasty.  We enjoyed a fun evening at North and South Seafood & Smokehouse, give them a visit, I know you'll enjoy your visit too."}
{"text":"Nice relaxed atmosphere and great food. Daily lunch specials and specials every day. Friday all you can eat fish fry with two side only $14. Very reasonable and everything is fresh and staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is nearly a 5-star review, but I just can't do it based on some really minor things.  We went here on our continued tour of brisket in Madison and this came out as one of the best!  When hubby orders brisket he always inquires about the fat content.  They did warn him there might be more fat than he prefers and he almost got the pulled pork instead, but he took a chance on the brisket to stick with our \"tour\".  It did come with fat around the edges but nothing that was too hard to trim off without losing half the sandwich.  It also had an excellent flavor (he gave me a taste).  A definite win on the quest for brisket in Madison.  I got the fried cod sandwich with a side of the bbq brisket beans.  Sandwich was good, but was bummed out that the serving of beans was so SMALL -- more like a sample size that a entree side.  I think they could have been a bit more generous on that.  Our table mates got the 2 entree combo plate and chose the grilled salmon and fried coconut ship.  The other entree choice was bbq brisket grilled cheese which was the most generous of the 4 meals.  Our friend thought his combo was on the light side for quantity, but the quality was definitely there.  He also got the clam chowder soup which was good but could have used more clam.  The potato pancakes were to die for!  Besides the brisket journey, a 2-for-1 Bucky Book coupon was also why we came here.  We read it as a 2-for-1 sandwich deal which we ordered.  Turns out it was for smoke house sandwiches which was we gather was their smoked meats so my cod sandwich didn't apply.  Instead we got $5 off our meal or I suppose we could have saved the coupon for another time.  So, just be aware to always read the fine print.  Our waitress was also awesome.  She was very nice, knew the menu well and was apologetic about the coupon situation.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We visited North and South for the first time on a Saturday and the goal was to have the smoked Prime Rib which we have heard about.  We arrived in the 6-7 hour and of course that was the busy time.  The wait was over 1 hour so we lucked out and grabbed a spot at the bar where another couple was leaving.  The bar was certainly cozy next to other patrons however we decided to eat dinner there.  The bar tender was on top of his game serving all the people at the bar and drinks for the restaurant.  He went out of his way to make sure we were happy and that was impressive.  We did order deep fried pickle chips for appetizer and the smoked Prime Rib.  The prime was awesome!!  The smoke flavor was fantastic and we had not ever had smoked prime rib before.  The overall experience for a busy night was outstanding.  I hope others can experience the same.  The owners were on site working hard as well.  Thank you to the team for making our night memorable.  We enjoyed it so much I wanted to go out of my way to write a review."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time there and I loved it!  I had prime rib, baked potato, barbecue  baked beans, and then key lime pie for dessert.  The food was excellent and I'm looking forward to going back as they have a great menu.  Also,  the staff was super friendly which I appreciate and I liked the atmosphere."}
{"text":"A diner-esque feel to a restaurant always tends to have a homely vibe to it and you kind of feel relaxed dining out at such places. This joint has a similar vibe albeit without the diner staples.   Service : Pleasant and on time I must say. Not one dish came too early or too late. Little things such as these do matter you know!  Value : Ermmmmm.... let's just say the portion - taste - price ratio was off here or atleast for what we ordered. My brisket dish which barely had 4 slices of brisket and perhaps 4 shrimps was almost $20!  Food : I deliberately kept this part at the end to focus on why this place didnt get a better rating. Let's start with the cornbread (Good). Shaped like muffins, these bites were a tad dry but still flavorful and the old cliche, butter makes everything better!  For mains, we ordered a New Orleans Cajun Jambalaya and Galveston. And oh heavens cry above, both lacked Seasoning!! I mean you can make a poem out of it if it helps to remember but please don't forget to season your food properly. I could make do with the jambalaya but the brisket without seasoning is crime worthy of no parole! The jamabalaya was cooked well though and the sausage had a kick to it that balanced well with the smoked but bland chicken.  The brisket was cooked very well I must say! Alas... I literally had to team it up with their mustard sauce to get some flavor out of it. The sides of Hush Puppies, Potato Cakes and wild rice were decent."}
{"text":"Terrible! Went there awhile back thinking it was like Joey's (formerly there) and it was awful. BRING BACK JOEYS"}
{"text":"Large menu, but not many light options (my only complaint). I came here for lunch with my parents, but the food definitely was targeted more for dinner. I would not recommend this place for vegetarians as there are few options. I enjoyed my shrimp tacos, though the chips and salsa were nothing special. Decent service and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Every time we come, I feel like the food I want to order is not available lol but the servers recommend good alternatives and the food is great every time!"}
{"text":"I find this a very unique reboot of the Joey's Seafood Restaurant. Babe and I tried it on Sunday as the Packers were getting slammed by the Panthers, and while the Packers were not playing very well the cooks in the kitchen were doing quite well. I had the Memphis Pulled Pork on Texas toast with hush-puppies and beaked beans. Pork was tender, hush-puppies (while smaller than I expected) were great, and the baked beans (bbq style) were awesome-sauce! Babe had the fire-cracker shrimp tacos with chips and salsa. She traded me a taco for hush-puppy and considering how big the hush-puppy was I definitely came out on top! The taco was amazing with a nice sweet creamy-mayo spicy sauce and perfectly fried shrimp. The chips were also nice, crunchy, and lightly salted.  The salsa was just salsa. Anyways, the Kansas Sweet BBQ sauce is the way to go. Definitely a must try since there seems to be an absence of locally owned BBQ joints on the West Side."}
{"text":"The service was fast , nice and the food and drinks were great. I had the Alaskan Denali salmon and it was pretty tasty. The spicy Bloody Mary was perfect . Over all a nice place to eat in a small town area worth the ride from the highway."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem on the west side of Madison. This food would put your typical famous daves type BBQ to shame and this place is supposed to be known for the seafood! Personally I don't eat seafood but the brisket sandwich is definitely good enough for me! Pricing is standard for a joint like this."}
{"text":"I came to North South on a Friday evening with a friend for dinner. I really was excited about the idea of both seafood and smokehouse items in one place. I'd never heard of such a concept in a restaurant. There was about a 45 minute wait at prime time on a Friday night, which is not bad. I noticed one of my favorite things in restaurants immediately: a high ceiling. I like restaurants with high ceilings. There is a nice bar along one wall where you can get a cocktail while waiting, or eat eat at the bar elbow to elbow with some strangers.  The menu has a wonderful selection of seafood and smoked goodies, along with appetizers and soups and sandwiches. Something for everyone. I started with a favorite of mine, Clam chowder. It was rich and velvety delicious. Great seafood flavor. I ordered a smoked filet of salmon with sides (you get two with entrees) and my dinner companion chose the non-smoked salmon filet. Both were fresh and done to perfection.  Service could not have been better, quicker or more congenial. Our server, a very tall gent, was enthusiastic about the menu and talked me into some key lime pie for dessert. My friend and I never felt rushed, and we lingered a bit with coffee after our meal. I could easily become a regular here, as everything came together for a great casual dining experience, and the menu has lots of things I would like to come back and try. $5.00 martinis Thursdays!"}
{"text":"The waiter was really great and very polite! He was very attentive and came to check on us often which was great! The atmosphere was very nice too. Very cozy and a nice smokehouse feel.   We started with the cheese curds which were extremely disappointing for Wisconsin cheese curds. They were very mushy and greasy. Some of them were not even melted in the middle. For the first time ever we didn't finish cheese curds. The Cajun ranch was excellent though. Not too spicy but a good smoky flavor with a little heat.   My husband ordered the Cape Hatteras wig seasoned fries and Mac and cheese. It was mediocre. The pork comes on Texas toast which isn't stated in the menu and didn't have much seasoning. The fries were not crispy and the Mac and cheese was runny. The fish tasted like average deep fried fish and was ok.   I had the Denali with mashed potatoes and BBQ brisket beans. The potatoes and the beans were delicious! The avocado orange salsa was delicious. It was spicier than I expected (I expected sweet) and was cilantro heavy but it was  really good. The salmon on the other hand was not good. I left half of it on the table when we left because I knew I was just going to throw it away if I took it home. It was over cooked,dry and rubbery and did not taste fresh.   For the price you get a lot of food. But the food was nothing to make us want to come back unfortunately."}
{"text":"My first dine-in experience with N&S was a winner! I'd had a couple bites of their pulled pork and brisket at an event about a year ago and liked it, so I did takeout for Mother's Day 2016. It had good flavor, but I think the travel time didn't let the items live up to their fullest potential (cornbread was soggy from steaming in the takeout container, for example). Still four stars, but dining in blew both experiences out of the water.   We ordered mini corn muffins to start and then a pulled pork plate and a brisket plate which came with a total of four sides: + Mini corn muffins: seven tiny muffins that were flavorful and soft; amounted to about two regular-sized corn muffins + Pulled pork: luscious without having chunks of fat; didn't need sauce but paired well with them anyway + Brisket: not as lean as I personally prefer but still 90% meat; super well-seasoned and I preferred it without sauce because the flavor was so good + Mashed potatoes: so creamy; there's definitely butter and cream in those bad boys + Mac and cheese: Cavatappi(?) with real cheese sauce and a good chew + BBQ beans: their sauces are delicious so I wasn't surprised these were, too + Hush puppies: probably the best I've ever had; the inclusion of herbs and onions in the dough makes for a much tastier and more tender bite of cornmeal heaven  My boyfriend and I both went in hungry and neither of us could finish our plates. Our server was great, offering up genuine recommendations and checking in enough that we always had full water and everything we needed without being intrusive.   Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I went here because of all the good reviews I seen on here, not sure what all the hype is about. The owner should be ashamed for having a \"barbecue dish\" named after my hometown of Austin. It is NO WHERE like Austin, not even a little bit. I would recommend taking a trip out there to Terry Black's Barbeque for the real taste of smoked barbecue. If you're \"known\" for smokin meats, you will surely smell it miles away! The brisket was definitely not fresh, it was warmed back up and not even luke warm, no smokiness, no signs of a smoke ring, it was like eating a extremely bland roast. Don't even get me started on the ribs, they were warmed up as well. They should also drug test their servers or find people that aren't higher than a kite! Our server was extremely high(not that I have a thing against weed smokers) but him acting like an idiot out of space saying the most off the wall things, starring at the wall behind us for a while, with his bloodshot red eyes is a bit much. Really tall white slim guy. For the price I paid of $50, I seriously would have rather gone to Chick-fil-A and had a better meal and service for 1/5th of the price. Obviously, stick with the seafood here. Don't call your self a Texan, if you can't even get a brisket right!"}
{"text":"I was feeling crab legs while in town and I used Yelp to find this place.  I was traveling for work with another guy too and we both loved the food here.  Everything is made in house i am told and it tastes like care is put into the food they serve.  Our server was Jesse, a flamboyant man with impeccable grooming skills, he was awesome!!  I made sure to stop one of the owners and give Jesse a compliment.  You will know it when you get him, he is fun, polite and he loves his job.  He gleams with pride while describing the history of the place, the owners, how they met and came up with the North and South name.  I got a pound of Crab meat and 2 sides for $22 even though the online menu said $27.  We both had the snow crab legs, they were very tasty, no butter was even needed. I feel as if i paid too little for the food.  Crab other places seems to be hard to find or expensive.  These guys are great.  I bookmarked this place and I will be stopping here every time I am in Madison.  That good.  They have an entire menu of great items.  We got the vegetable sides which were fresh and NOT overcooked.  We also had the braised beef chili and OMG - it tastes better than it sounds.  There is a $2 up-charge for that but worth every penny.  Jesse also brought us a sample of the Gumbo, which I normally stay away from in the Midwest.  In my past experience, gumbos and chowders in the Midwest  are rather fishy smelling and I will abort in a second if it is fishy smelling.  That is a sign of old seafood.  The Gumbo here was delicious and i would never had expected it in Wisconsin.  If you like that type of food, do not shy away because of your geographical location.    The atmosphere is nice.  They have a beautiful marine fish tank with Tangs and a Puffer fish.  He watched me eat seafood, I felt a bit guilty, LOL.  The staff here are great, the food is great and I will be back for sure and so will the guy that I was here with.   If I lived closer, i would come here all the time.  Thanks for a great dinner."}
{"text":"PROS: All-you-can-eat Friday fish fry for $14 per person CONS: Busy, some wait time expected  We came here for the all-you-can-eat fish fry, which was quite good. The fish was crispy on the outside and nice and flaky in the inside. The initial order comes with 2 sides, after which they will keep bringing you more fried fish until you can't eat anymore. They have specials everyday, and I would love to come back to check out another one of their specials."}
{"text":"This location is in a strip mall right on Main Street and should not be judged from the outside.  They did a really nice job turning this into a sit-down restaurant.  We were greeted quickly by an employee and the awesome smell of BBQ.  There was only one other table when we arrived at 11:30a on a Saturday.  Our waitress took our drink orders and returned quickly with all of them.  We ordered armadillo eggs (their take on jalapeno poppers) at the same time as our entrees, informing her that we'd like them out early.  She said she'd return with them shortly but it still took about 15 minutes.  The presentation wasn't that great - there were 5 of them on a large plate which made them look skimpy for the $8.50.  Our main entrees came out about 5 minutes after the appetizer, too soon.    Two of us had the firecracker shrimp tacos, a smokehouse sandwich and the brisket grilled cheese.  The tacos were filled full of shrimp and other fresh ingredients but the chips that were served alongside were literally dripping in grease and neither one of my companions ate many of them.  My brisket grilled cheese was delicious!  It was pretty rich, almost seemed like a queso sauce instead of melted cheese.  I opted for the sweet potato fries for the extra $1 but can't say they were worth it.  Again, the presentation could've been a little better.  The small amount of fries that came on the side were spread out over the large plate which again, made it looks skimpy.   The lunch rush didn't seem as busy as I had expected based on reviews and the loud country music that had been playing when we first got there was on an extended break.  The music started back up again, only to be shut off abruptly.  Service was pretty decent and the restaurant itself was very clean.  The fireplace is a nice touch too.  The bathrooms were clean but there was only one stall in the women's room.  I believe this was a Pizza Pit prior to being converted so maybe the bathrooms were just leftover. I would give this place another chance, or try their west side location."}
{"text":"Excellent service!!  We only had an appetizer but it was SUPER!!  We will be back for the crab leg night this week!"}
{"text":"I liked this place .. I had a salad and the shrimp.. I'm trying to watch my girlish figure hahahaha.. but my hubby had the brisket we both agreed it was a bit dry.. sorry guys : (   But the ribs were delish.. and the potato cakes were crisp and good.. they are kind of the size of a crab cake but made from shredded potatoes and breaded in a corn meal type crust... we dipped them in the butter from my shrimp YUMMO.. nice people working there the server Erin really made the experience complete ..  Btw when you walk in the SMOKY smell whets your appetite  ... enjoy! TIP don't be scared off by the exterior of this place it's in a strip mall..  the inside is clean and decorated real cool !! Go here and check it out .."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. The Monday night special is crab legs and it was fairly busy when we arrived @ 6:30pm. We didn't have reservations but were promptly seated in a roomy booth.   Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and made several recommendations. The overall service was excellent -- thank you Jeff.  The armadillo egg appetizer is heavenly. 6 jalapeños halves stuffed with cheddar and cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and smoked. I will always order these.  The sandwich special was a pulled pork cubano made with crispy and juicy smoked pork with pickles on Texas toast with French fries. It was a generous size and large enough to share. A great value for $10.00. The clam chowder was thin and lacking in clams and potatoes. The gumbo was thick with tomatoes, okra, sausage and rice. We both ordered brandy old fashions and they were good.   The food is excellent, homemade and value priced. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Great seafood and good bbq. The brisket and ribs are tasty and each day has a food special."}
{"text":"The shrimp here are massive.  MASSIVE.  Also, the best shrimp in Madison, period.  On Thursdays they will throw in five extra, massive shrimp for the price of three normal orders (5 per order).  The coleslaw, beans, brisket, cheese curds, cocktail sauce, ranch dressing -all good.  I wasn't a a a fan of the hush puppies due to hidden jalapenos.  I bring everyone here.  So good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I go often on Friday's to get all you can eat fish fry. The food is very good and I love that there is so much variety on the menu. This would be a great place to go if you had picky eaters or a large group. Always call ahead."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...WE LOVE THIS PLACE... WE have had nothing that was stub standard....EVERYTHING EXCEPTIONAL! we lOVE the SHRIMPTASTIC Thursdsy special... enough for a complete meal of left overs on FRIDAY! Worth the drive... if you are not in Deforest... there is one on the west side of Madison...."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went out for a late Valentine's day celebration. We decided to give this place a try. They were very busy but we were seated within a few minutes. Our server was very attentive and helpful with menu suggestions. We ordered the cheese curds for an appetizer and they were amazing! I seriously love cheese curds so this is high praise coming from me. They were lightly breaded and very buttery. Melt in your mouth good! For my main course, ?I ordered the fried perch. It came with two sides and about three pieces of fish. The seasonal veggies were tasty and the fries were good too. The portions were just right. The fish was very good! Again lightly breaded so the flavor of the fish comes through. I can't wait to go on a Friday night so we can try the fish fry. My husband had a bbq brisket and it was equally good. He said it is the best he has had since leaving Texas. :) We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We love this place, especially for fish fry! It's our go-to date night. Get there early in case of a long wait. Know that he portion sizes for barbecue are smaller than what you'd expect from chain BBQ joints, but that isn't a bad thing!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Driving through and have been wanting to visit here for some time ....   I had crab legs- just so delish. Btw, great deals on Monday and Tuesday for Crab legs - if they are your thing.  Hubby had spare ribs - he loved them. Dry rubbed, smoked and lean.   Happy hour on Sunday- all day.   Casual atmosphere. So perfect for our trip through. This becomes a place to get to Madison for.... We must start planning our next trip back."}
{"text":"Where do I start! ...... simply  amazing!!! Andrew 5+ stars! Best strawberry margarita I've ever had.... and I've tried margaritas all over the world. NY/Nj native very hard to please ... from the food to my drink 5 stars!!! Andrew made good conversation as I traveled to WI for Epic Cert alone.... Fairfield Inn Verona recommendation!!! Pescatarian friendly.... the Mac and cheese was not baked but the cheese was so delicious I didn't notice. A must come too hands down!!"}
{"text":"Once you know North and South (it will always be known as Joey's to me), you will never be able to go to a chain like Red Lobster again. Great food, friendly service, and a comfortable atmosphere. The BBQ sauce selection is a favorite for kids and adults and are complementary to smoked meats or French fries. I recommended the cornbread as an appetizer to share-it's a great deal at ~$2."}
{"text":"The food was alright, I was disappointed they ran out of brisket the night I went.  I ordered crab legs instead which came out ice cold in spots. The smoked chicken nachos were delicious and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Jd has done a great job. This place is well worth the drive from the overcrowded scene in Madison. Do yourself a favor and come here"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence between 3 and 4 stars. Call this a 3.5 star review.   First off: the service here is definitely good. Every employee I've interacted with the few times I've come here was very pleasant and that made for a favorable experience. You don't get that everywhere and it's important. Good job with the staff.   To be honest I'm not 100% sure I understand the logic behind a combination seafood & BBQ restaurant, and the old \"jack of all trades, master of none\" cliche had me a bit hesitant to try this place. That said, it's actually pretty decent.   I've mostly gotten things that are sorta-quasi healthy which maybe I should indulge in a big pile of brisket instead? The last time I went, I got a combo of catfish and pulled pork, which both items were solid if maybe a bit unremarkable. When I ordered this and was asked which 2 sides I'd like, I thought I'd be getting a giant amount of food, but the BBQ beans came in a metal ramekin kinda like you'd get a side of ketchup in, just a bit bigger, and there were maybe 8 hush puppies.   One thing that is definitely excellent is the jalapeno cheddar skillet cornbread. That stuff is real good.   Overall, for a relatively cheap and chill west side place to go that's a local business with good service and pretty OK food, you could certainly do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Tonight my friend and I decided to try it out for dinner. She had been here previously on a date, I was coming in blind.   I'll start by saying our waitress was very nice and polite. She came up to the table right away, and let us take our time on the menu. My friend came in knowing what she wanted, I was the one who needed to make up my mind.   We started with cheese curds, which were really good. My friend liked the ancho chili ranch that came with it, I wasn't a huge fan. To be fair on that, and it does color part of my review later, I really can't handle most peppers or spicy things. I know, I'm awful and a spice weenie.   My friend ordered the hand battered shrimp with the brisket baked beans and hush puppies. I ordered the ahi tuna tacos. Here's where things got a bit jumbled. As mentioned, peppers and I don't get along. I told the waitress that I can't eat peppers, so I would like it without the jalapeño slaw and with lettuce instead.   We'll start with my friend's dish, because I'm still super jealous I didn't order some myself. Their hand battered shrimp are awesome. They're big, the batter is crispy, and they've got good flavor without sauce. I tried her beans, and they didn't taste like anything super special to me. They were just baked beans. Hush puppies were a little over fried, and had jalapeños in it, something not mentioned in the menu. (I feel like main ingredients really need to make it on to menus more often)  My meal. Well, the first time it came out I was pretty excited looking at it, and the excitement kind of died out. The tuna, which had been listed as \"seared with spices rare in the middle\", was indeed just overcooked tuna. It was white all the way through and the pieces were small and jagged looking. The avocado mandarin salsa looked good, but had jalapeños all over it. I didn't notice it right away, and found out only after I'd bitten in to one. The waitress came up pretty quick after we'd tried a few bites to see how things were. I explained the pepper situation, and she felt really bad because she didn't know they were in there. The good news is the tacos she brought back were amazing. The tuna came out like it was meant to, white on the edge deliciously pink in the center, and they were decent sized slabs. The seasoning blend was good and wasn't too much for my delicate self.   I feel like they're a solid 3.5 or 4 based on my friend's food and my second plate. I'll have to go back and see how the BBQ side of things looks."}
{"text":"I had plans to join my mom for lunch and we decided to try North and South since it was close and hey - BBQ always sounds good to me!  I was pleasantly surprised by the renovation from the old Joey's Seafood restaurant - very warm and comfortable.  The menu had plenty of good-looking options.  The \"smokehouse sandwich\" features \"today's selected smoked meat\".  I figured that would be great, whatever the meat was, but if you look to the back of the room you'll see the various smoked meats you can choose from.  Mom ordered the pulled pork - a smokehouse staple.  I asked about some of the other options and the waitress said that the brisket was \"to die for\".  Well, how do you NOT have that then?  I went with the brisket and Mom promptly switched to it as well.  The other options for us were pulled chicken and turkey breast.  The food was excellent.  The brisket had a nice crust on it and the meat was very tender - and not really fatty like some places make.  It was delicious.  You have a choice of three sauces and a mustard sitting on your table.  I was torn between \"Spicy Whiskey\" and \"Kansas City Sweet\".  The \"Smoky Smoky\" was, well, a little too smoky for me...  The KC Sweet was just as it sounds - sweet and tasty.  The Spicy Whisky was excellent with a bit of after burn.  I wanted something between the two, so I just combined them and it was excellent.  The fries were very impressive - super fresh!  Dipping them in KC Sweet was the way to go - forget the ketchup!  I would have like a little more cole slaw versus the sample-size they provide.  There was just enough to put on your sandwich if that's how you roll.  I will certainly ring this bell again.  The food is great, the staff are super friendly, and it's a clean, welcoming environment.  What more do you need?  It's also close to work - with fast service it makes for an easy lunch break without chewing up your time."}
{"text":"We came here by accident and can't wait to come back! I had a combo with haddock and cod and pulled pork. All were perfect. I am moving from Nashville and won't miss bbq with this place. The sides are amazing. Beans are often an afterthought. Here they are stars. Potato cakes are interesting. Like hash brown casserole cakes. My fiancee had chicken and pork combo with great slaw and sweet potato fries. All wonderful stuff. True margaritas.  Always a bonus to have a server like Alex. She told us the story and how much she loves working there. Just a great experience!"}
{"text":"North and South has been on my radar for quite some time, and today I had a chance to stop in and try it for the first time. I'm a huge BBQ fan and I've eaten at some of the very best joints in the country, but I've never been anywhere that blends a seafood menu and bbq to this extent. To be honest I was pretty skeptical, but in the end I was very pleasantly surprised by this first exploration. Here's what i had:  Iced Tea - fresh brewed and very good. Strong and flavorful without being bitter. We were off to a good start!   Fried Pickles - the pickles were sliced into nice, expertly thin chips before being breaded and fried. The breading is light, crisp, and excellently flavored. There was a bit of a taste from the oil but they were not greasy or heavy at all. I also really enjoyed the dipping sauce they were served with. Superb example of one of my favorite sides. Honestly, this got me excited to come back just to try their fried fish dishes some time. If they can execute fish the way they did pickles it will be a surefire winner!   Pulled Pork - moist, smoky, and flavorful without being overly fatty. Nice job on the pulled pork for sure. One important note, this is truly pulled pork, and some of what we were served was a little on the long side in terms of the particular strands of muscle. This is a nice indication of actually pulling the well smoked pork butts, but not the easiest to eat or share. I'm a believer that BBQ should be eaten with the hands! A quick chop or two would have been good in this particular case, but overall a really solid job on the pulled pork!    Brisket - we had slices from the flat, including the very first 'end' cut, which is exceptionally flavorful, if prone to being a little more on the dry side. There was a bit more fat cap left on the flat than I usually like and the fat may have benefitted from just a bit more time on the smoker to render a little more completely (or being served just a bit hotter). The overall taste and texture were very good, probably the best I've had in Madison. The brisket was cooked properly, making it very moist and tender but not falling apart. Serving size might have been just a touch on the small side; another slice would have been very welcome. I wasn't asked if I wanted flat or point, perhaps they only smoke flats? Either way, a good solid job on the brisket as well.   Ribs - these were a half rack or so of baby-back ribs. I general I greatly prefer big, meaty, tasty spare ribs, but for baby-backs these were pretty good. The edges were a bit charred and I wonder if they might benefit from a lower/slower cook, but I've certainly had worse. The meat came cleanly away from the bones, but again, they were not overcooked or mushy, which is rare in a restaurant rib. I think the pork and brisket were both better, but all in all these were not bad.   Chicken - sliced, smoked chicken breast is a weird choice for a BBQ preparation. I was hoping this would be either pulled or served as whole, bone in pieces. To my mind I'd call this smoked rather than BBQed (I know, that conversation is a whole big thing...) and it was okay but noth something I'd order again.   BBQ Brisket Beans - these were a really nice side! Extremely flavorful, with a nice color and aroma; although maybe cooked just a bit more than I'd really like. The texture was quite soft, although not off putting. Very close to being truly excellent, but the overly smooth and homogeneous mouthfeel was just a tiny bit off my preference. I'd order them again for sure, but a little less cooking time might really make them sing!   French fries - good solid order of fries, but nothing special. I'd have loved to see them flavored with a bit of BBQ rub or something like that, but these were just standard fries.   The brisket and pulled pork were both served on a half slice of Texas toast, which was nice but not amazing. It tasted a little oily rather than nice and buttery; overall fine.   I tried all the sauces and each was good in its own right. The Carolina Mustard sauce was an okay representation of the style, but maybe a tad heavy on the vinegar flavor. The spicy whiskey sauce had surprisingly strong flavors of both spice and whiskey! NICE! The smoky sauce was really solid and I think the KC sweet was my personal favorite. Unfortunately the squeeze bottles of sauce at our table seemed to have been out for quite a while and had both separated and congealed a bit. That meant the first application was a runny mess followed by a gloppy, gel-like consistency. Great BBQ doesn't need sauce, but if you're going to put it out make sure you're doing it justice and providing customers something to enhance their meal, not detract from it.   My wife and both our son and daughter really enjoyed the meal as well, and everyone left feeling contented but not stuffed. With tip we came in at just under $50.   N&S is a solid find and I'm sure I'll visit again soon. Not perfect BBQ, but quite good. Next time, fish!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my parents and brother for a birthday dinner.  It was Thursday's Shrimp special.  Twenty shrimp two side dishes for 18.99.  Everyone but my brother had that special.  We all had good things we liked.  Parents liked the size of the shrimp and corn bread.   I was not a fan of the hand-battered shrimp.  I felt the coating was too doughy and didnt add a nice mouth feel.  The shrimp inside the coating was cooked well so I took the coating off the last few I ate.  The Grilled shrimp were super.  I would come back for them.  The corn bread is good.  The Mac and Cheese has a creamy cheesy flavor.  But it's made to order:  noodles with  pour over cheese instead of baked and married flavors.  It was good but not my expectation.  My brother had the brisket sandwich.  He has been to the North and South in DeForest before.  He stated the brisket in this sandwich was superior to the brisket at the other location's buffet.  It looked delicious!  Everyone was happy with their meals.  Service was good and we were checked on frequently.  They have call ahead seating so on busy evenings call before you arrive .  I'd come back to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"nice little place with a unique menu.   the crabs legs where great and the service was excellent.  I'm tempted to go back next week to try the smoked pork."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for delicious bbq meat tonight! Yelp reviews for this place looked pretty good, so I gave it a try. Upon entering, I told the person who greeted me that I was \"new\", and wanted to order carry-out. Even tho they were kind of busy, he was super friendly and helpful. He offered me a seat at the bar, poured me an ice-cold Spotted Cow, and took the time to explain some things on the menu. I ordered, then waited maybe 10 minutes, and I was off and running. Yum... I had the beef brisket with sweet potato fries. The meat was super tender and delicious...exactly what I was craving! (I wish I would've known to ask for some bbq sauce to put on it tho.) My husband got the ribs, and said they were really good, too. I think we will eat \"dine-in\" next time - really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner and left quite happy. I ordered the Athens (I think) - pulled pork & pulled chicken, and I got mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. I tried a couple different sauces, but liked the Smoky one the best. The pork & chicken were cooked very well - nice and tender with a little bit of char.  The mashed potatoes were average, maybe even mediocre, but the mac & cheese was delicious. Portions were not huge, but I left satisfied, so I suppose I can't complain. Will go there again and look forward to trying the seafood."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, service is good, tucked away in Deforest. Plenty of parking as well.  I ordered the brisket tacos, with a side of coconut shrimp. It was AMAZING. Planning on taking my husband here for his birthday next week."}
{"text":"Improvement over the former Joeys with quality fish and decent pricing.    Can't go wrong with their fish fry and mini corn cakes"}
{"text":"Definitely in my top 5 restaurants in Madison! I love the nice selection of seafood combinations and my husband usually chooses one or a combination of their BBQ meats. His favorite is smoked beef brisket or pork ribs. We have even carried out BBQ for a party, and it was a huge hit!! Expect a wait on Saturday nights...but the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We found this place via the Bucky Book and decided to try their BBQ for lunch. I ordered the brisket sandwich and my boyfriend had the pulled pork. Both meats came out moist, juicy and full of flavor. Sauces on the table were tasty and enhanced the meat without overpowering the smoky flavor. The coleslaw was probably the best I've had- sweet and creamy. We were also pleased with the beans and fries. Service was attentive and our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and made some great suggestions for our next visit. Since this visit, we have made it a point to drive out from Sun Prairie often. I would strongly suggest starting the meal off with some of their excellent hand battered cheese curds or the Brisket Nachos with an addictive chipotle sour cream. This has become our go to place and we enjoy bringing guests here to experience great bbq. Save some room at the end of the meal for the delicious key lime pie!"}
{"text":"Top quality brisket on par with the best in Texas. Dry rub ribs also as good as the best anywhere. Coleslaw spot on."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try North and South and I'm glad we did.   We were there around 6:00 on a Thursday night and were seated immediately.  The dining room was almost full but tables kept turning over.   I had a Caesar salad and it was fresh and nicely topped with croutons, cherry tomatoes and shredded Parmesan.  I followed this with the Denali which is a cedar plank salmon topped with an avocado and orange salsa. Great flavor to accompany the salmon. I had the seasonal vegetables along with it which was broccoli, red peppers and zucchini.   My husband had the full rack of ribs, cole slaw and fries. He enjoyed all of it.   The special of the night was shrimp. 20 shrimp for $17 and you could pick 2 methods of preparation. Next time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed the Tuesday night special. One benefit of this seafood house is that it has daily specials every day For alcohol Tuesday is buy one margarita and get one free  For food: two pounds of snow crab legs with 2 sides $29.50. Add 1/2 pound of snow crab legs for $5. The crab legs are really good  Besides the special, we also ordered the crabcakes and mussels as appetizers and New York strip as another entree $24.00 for 12oz with 2 sides. The crab cakes is yummy. The mussels are juicy but too salty. The medium New York strip is so so/ nothing special. (I mean, no good no bad. But in future, I won't order a steak in a seafood house.) The sides we chose are seasonal vegetables, sweet potato fries and BBQ brisket bean, which are all good! We will try some other choices next time, The server Christine is very very nice. Checked us multiple times to ask what we need and what do you think about the taste.  In general. It is a nice restaurant you deserve to try."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out last week with my family. We stopped in on a Thursday and the parking lot was packed! We were worried it might take a while to get a table, but were pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away!   The look of the restaurant and the decor inside is nice. It's a pretty new place yet, so everything is in good condition, it's well kept, clean and shiny. I liked it.   Thursday is their shrimp special night. 3 of us at the table went with the shrimp special, and just one ordered something else. I tried to order the salmon, however they were out. That was a big bummer as salmon is my favorite fish and I was really looking forward to it, however they made up for it by comping my shrimp meal. They totally didn't have to do that and it was super appreciated.   The service was great, and the food was equally delicious. We started with cheese curds. They were prepared really well. Not too greasy, nice and crispy.   I went with the shrimp scampi and grilled shrimp for two shrimp options, along with a side of mac and cheese and potato cakes. The mac and cheese was seriously impressive. When it came out, it didn't look like it would be as good as it was. They must keep the noodles and the cheese separate, and only when the mac is ordered drizzle the cheese over the noodles. It was SO good! The cheese was plentiful and super creamy. Yum! The potato cakes were fantastic as well. They are cheesy potato things, they look to be made up of hash browns, and they come in little puck-shaped patties. Crispy on the outside, cheesy on the inside. The shrimps, both flavors, were very as well.   Others at the table went with the bang-bang shrimp, which looked awesome, and the coconut shrimp, which looked great as well. The breaded shrimps were huge! Good deal for the money!   Overall, it was a great experience, even without the salmon :) I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've hit the Madison West location of this restaurant a few times-my husband and I are fans.  Because I wanted shrimp for lunch we opted to check out this location.  I was very impressed.  The hostess was seating a party right as we walked in, however another staff member grabbed menus and sat us immediately.  Our server was very polite and quick.  I have zero complaints.  Zero.  The restaurant was very clean.   My side salad came served on a cold plate.  Sure it's a little thing, but it was a decent side salad and served cold made it better.  We ordered mini corn bread muffins.  Also received those within five minutes hot and fresh with a cup of whipped butter.  The lunch special was 2 meats, a side and a cup of soup or salad for $13.50.  I not only received my giant amazing coconut shrimp that let me forget I'm not near the ocean, but I tried some of their pulled pork.  It was soft and melt in your mouth delicious.  I also appreciated it was leaner and without a ton of spices.    Thank you again, North and South."}
{"text":"I came back to this establishment after the owners thanked me for my review and specifically said to check it out again with kids.  My daughter loved watching the fish and we got to watch them eat as well.  The staff was incredibly friendly and talked with my daughter about her interests, not minding that she's mostly non-verbal.    We came for lunch so I didn't partake in any of the yummy-looking cocktails on the menu.  Our food was up within minutes.  The burger was perfectly cooked.  Her chicken wasn't frozen nuggets, but lightly battered chicken breast.  She loves yellow mustard and without asking we were also offered other condiments and brought a bottle of yellow.  I definitely would recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service was excellent. Came with two toddlers and a baby.  The cheese curds earned a top 5 in greater madison in my book.  The kids chicken fingers were the best chicken fingers I've ever tried.  The brisket tacos were superb.  We will be back soon!  Best restaurant in deforest area, hands down."}
{"text":"Tired of chain BBQ? There's hope. The folks (Keith and Erin) who run this place have quite a menu of great tasting stuff. I first tasted their ribs/brisket/pulled pork at an event that they catered and promptly put them on my \"must\" list. Last Saturday was the day. Turns out Saturday is their Smoked Prime Rib special day and since I don't bite into Prime Rib all that often, certainly not Smoked Prime Rib ... the ribs will have to wait. I ordered the 16oz serving (+potato cakes and salad), some else ordered the 10 oz serving (+slaw and fries) and the S.U. ordered the smoked salmon special (+slaw and fries).  The Smoked PR was killer. It was a big portion served a perfect medium rare. Fantastic!. The potato pancakes were excellent. The S.U. wagged her finger at me for ordering the big slab o' meat but I pointed out to her that, while I was very happy and well sated, our companion who showed 10 oz of restraint, was already talking about going back for another one in the parking lot. No question, meat eaters, get the smoked PR. Next time ribs!   The S.U.'s smoked salmon was large and also very tasty. I smoke my own salmon and it was a bit salty for my tastes. She liked it. A big chunk came home with us and made it's way into smoked salmon/fresh chives scrambled eggs the next morning. Mmmmm!  Un-Chain yourself and go check this place out. Good eating, fer sure!"}
