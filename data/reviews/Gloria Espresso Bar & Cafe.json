{"text":"Fantastic option for coffee on Roncesvalles. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Just opened so their food options are limited, but what they have is great so far. They will customise whatever you want as well. Looking forward to seeing what they add over time. Only downfall is limited seating if you're going to do some work."}
{"text":"Not in the area very often but I'll come back as often as I can to have the coffee again. It was very reasonably priced, the cafe's interior was nicely decorate, and the baristas were very friendly. I'll be sure to come back to try more of the baked goods."}
{"text":"Seriously,  I never use Yelp but I can't get over the super buttery croissant and a great coffee to match. If your walking by pop in,  it's worth it,  great atmosphere and great service. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and coffee here! Lovely atmosphere and artwork on the walls. Very welcoming of families."}
{"text":"A fantastic coffee shop with excellent coffee and a cute vibe. Great Montreal bagels and baked goods. The beans here also provide a great cup o' Joe at home and come with a free drink! 
Check this place out at the top of the beautiful Roncy."}
{"text":"Another great Coffee Shop I can add to my favorites list! I think maybe also I have a soft spot for this place because of it's name. My Aunt Gloria would be super proud that she shares her name with a place like this.

Anyways- This place is the best! Really great coffee and treats with just enough seating. The decor is also 100% amazing. My go to is and always will be their americanos and some sort of muffin or cookie. Their bagels are apparently really good too. 

Also they have pancake days!! yay!  Gotta go to one of those for sure."}
{"text":"This has become my new go-to coffee shop. Although there are a few others closer to where I live, it's worth walking an extra few minutes to go here instead. Not only is their coffee more delicious than some other places in the area, the service is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Here I am trolling yelp on my lunch hour, searching new stuff along Ronces. End up on Gloria's page, our beloved neighborhood cafe.
I feel compelled to throw a five star review in here to offset the funny but v v crusty one-star review. 

Bryan is THE nicest owner. I believe their baked goods are sourced from blackbird (which is v tasty) and go quickly on the weekends. Their sandwiches are simple, delicious and made with love and I have never had less than a friendly, neighborly experience here with his staff. 

We've recently been tinkering with coffee at home on the weekends but Gloria is never far~!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee coming from a coffee snob! Relaxed and chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has a lovely vintage vibe while still being airy. Their coffee is good but I would have loved it to be a little stronger. I didn't eat anything but my friend said their homemade scones are amazing. I found it easy to work here, quiet and good backround music but was disappointed the Wi-Fi wasn't working."}
{"text":"The food and coffee were delicious. Like keep eating long after you're full kinda thing. Will definitely be back. Regularly."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to get coffee on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed this little coffee shop! You Roncesvalles neighbours are very lucky to have such great java in the 'hood! Came here after checking out the cherry blossoms at High Park. Upon our entering the cafe, the fella at the cash (presuming the owner) greeted us with a smile and asked if we had any questions. I ordered an iced mocha and BF ordered a second iced drink. Prices are definitely fair. Their baked goods are also delicious - I kept wanting to eat more of the banana bread BF ordered. Ample sunlight in the afternoon and perfect space for working or studying. Watch your head as you walk downstairs to the washroom - the ceiling is a bit lower than expected."}
{"text":"I have spent the afternoon working at Gloria a few times in the past month. Compared to the over-crowded Reunion Island or the crappy Starbucks down the street, it is a fantastic shop that I hope is here for awhile. 

Some thoughts:

First, the coffee blend and baked goods are delicious. The muffins are especially well thought out. I don't know if they have a supplier or if they bake it themselves. The lady next to me on my first visit remarked that the sandwiches were great, too.

Second, the service is awesome. Coffee places can sometimes be full of jerks, but these folks are no-nonsense without sacrificing quality. They're friendly, which is in short supply at 3pm on a Thursday in most coffee shops. 

Thirdly, they were playing through the Ella Fitzgerald catalogue on my second visit, which is perfect music for a rainy, if productive afternoon. 

Of the countless new coffee options popping up in Roncie & Bloor West, Gloria takes the cake."}
{"text":"Pretentious hipster garbage. Your baristas spend their shifts inviting friends in to gossip while your patrons are unattended to and mocked. Not even Sloane can bump this poor excuse for a coffee shop up a star. The baked goods are laughable. We get that you're upset that American apparel closed down but now that you've all received unwarranted raises, your proprietors are banking on you retaining your jobs and having somewhat respectable work ethic.

TL;DR 1/10

Go to Fantail down the street instead."}
{"text":"I live in the area,tried other places but this place has the best almond milk cappuccino!!Love this place!!"}
{"text":"The most significant of part of his character is his insignificance. 

Gloria here we come to savour the scrumptious sandwiches and great coffee prepared by Erin, one of the best looking baristas in town !"}
{"text":"Delicious coffees (with all the milk options!) made by welcoming and friendly staff.  I love their almond milk latte, brownies and rice crispy treats. A charming place to meet a friend or sit alone."}
{"text":"Very cute spot! Good coffee, yummy snacks, and I love the environment! Saw on Instagram that they host live jazz nights; definitely looking forward to checking that and to frequenting this spot!"}
{"text":"There is nothing I do not like about this place--maybe besides the fact I wish it was in the Junction 

I decided to take a walk on Roncy and stopped into Gloria, I forgot how great the coffee is and the ambiance is here.  The first time I was here it was a few months after Bryan and opened shop and he was nervous on the success of his business--couple years later and his shop is busy busy busy!

I returned this time ordering a cortado to go but instead sat down on the wooden chairs to the side to chat away and take some photos.  Every seat was filled soon after.

The cortado was lovely, a smaller cup to fit the less milk and it was perfectly made.  Ended up finishing the cup there, the ambiance was just too \"please sit and enjoy the coffee\" 

Bryan was very friendly and made an effort to speak to every patrons that come in personally.  Even with a line up he tries to make each experience personal 

There are food available from pastries to sandwiches but I did not try.  The interior has a certain charm where wooden floors, white wall and a large mirror were the main point the eyes saw; A mixture of modern and old.  Love the homage to his grandparents on one wall where a black and white 35mm photo was taken and blown up onto one wall, seems like a fun year \"'63\" was captioned above..."}
{"text":"I may be biased as I couldn't be happier to have a quality cafe open next door to my apartment. But Gloria is top shelf. The coffee is exquisite and reasonably priced. The baked goods are delightful, and the bagels in particular are heavy and chewy, Montreal-style. The turkey havarti sandwich is rightly flavoured, savoury with that old-cheese bite. 

The premises themselves are light, open, and airy. A huge mirror makes the room feel larger than it is and the Spartan decor makes the place feel grand and flowing, not spare. Brian, the proprietor, is affable and warm--and his staff follows the same business model. 

Add to this the new trend of hosting live music on weekends and displaying local art and you have a winning combo in north Roncesvalles. They run weekly raffles for AGO tickets with plans to do the same for Jays games in season (!!). I can't wait to see what is in store for Gloria in warmer months, as their January 1 opening means that hey haven't been able to take advantage of open doors and outdoor seating--yet.

Minor complaints include the occasional order gaffe (cream cheese instead of PB or overcharging on a latte), and the fact that the cavernous space doesn't do well when filled with shouting children on weekends. But all told, Gloria is a bastion of calm and good vibes and deserves all the success that is surely coming their way. Bonus points for sheer cheek and audacity opening across the road from Starbucks."}
{"text":"so I new coffee shop has just opened up \"time to coffee it up\". Family owned coffee shop with a great start up with so much potential.

Coffee has a good strong blend to it, so this will be my morning go to coffee place but the grind of the bean was to be perfected, it's there first day opening and coffee.

Positives 
1. No sour aftertaste or smell
2. Smooth
3. Sugar not required
4. You can taste the quality of the coffee bean.
5. Over all great cup of coffee"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. ONLY RECOMMENDATION IS TO BRING CASH! Their credit card system doesn't always work. Other than that it's Super cute, relaxing spot right across of the Starbucks. Definitely beats Starbucks! They really take care of you here and their light sandwiches are delicious."}
