{"text":"Cute place, conveniently downtown near where I work.  I've only had their beverages but they were all delicious; I hope to have lunch here soon."}
{"text":"Niko's has the best coffee in Pittsburgh! I miss their old location in Robinson, but they are worth the trip downtown. I buy their fresh ground coffee by the pound on a regular basis."}
{"text":"On a whim one recent  weekday morn, I decided to enter this thin but comfortable coffee house for a spot of hot chocolate and came away with a scalding styrofoam cup of milky, cocoa-infused invigoration that retained its heat all the way to Lawrenceville. Due to the cordial service and the quality of my sweet, belly-warming beverage, I feel obligated to return for a sandwich or a pastry sometime soon."}
