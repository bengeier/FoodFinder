{"text":"Despite the fact this place is a 5 minute walk from our home I've probably only been inside once or twice.  It just never looked very clean to me.  Recently, my partner and I went for brunch on a Sunday.  I will admit the pancakes are delicious and that's exactly what I ordered.  Unfortunately, the young man who brought our plates to the table carried a plate of eggs on top of my blueberry pancakes - YUCK.  When I asked him to please take back my pancakes and explained why he assured me the bottom of plate had not touched my food, however, he was unable to explain how blueberry sauce managed to get all over the bottom of the plate of eggs.  He took the dish back to the kitchen and I watched as he told the \"cook\" what happened.  The cook appeared to laugh and share the story with several others behind the counter (apparently oblivious to the fact that the \"kitchen\" is open and in plain view of the diners.)  The cook then put a glove on and used his hand to scrape off the blueberries and put new new blueberries on the same pancakes.  The server brought my \"new\" pancakes back and I promptly sent them back.  In all fairness, our original server did not know anything about this and she apologized and offered to bring me another meal.  Needless to say, we both had lost our appetites. I knew there was a reason I didn't eat here..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, staff was very welcoming and friendly and there was no wait at all! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My favorite of the Pamela locations. Not as much of a wait as the Strip or Oakland. Bring cash!"}
{"text":"excellent venue for breakfast

long lines on weekends

love the fruit filled crepes

omlettes OK

it's a cash only place"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Always a wait for a table (dont try groups larger than 4) but the line moves fast and its worth it for the great food, particularly the exceptional pancakes. However, service is only soso and place is cash only."}
{"text":"Dirty men's room.   Manager standing, eating in front of customers.   Unsure of who our server was.  Serving staff appeared and disappeared.  No one returned to fill coffee.    Pancakes were good, the rest of the food average.   Noisy.   Disappointing after so many strong reviews. There are better options."}
{"text":"Pancakes are amazingly good; service is incredibly bad.  Highly recommend it for the food; but beware - service is truly bad.  It's a \"I can't-be-bothered-with-you\" type of attitude which drives me nuts.

As long as you go for the food and recognize that the waitresses are just snotty you'll enjoy yourself (and yes, there is a wait - always)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pamela's location. The staff is so friendly and treats the regulars like family. The food is great, the atmosphere feels wholesome. It's always a great day when you go here for breakfast with the family. My dad loves the super thin, crispy pancakes that they make."}
{"text":"What's not to love?

 Best breakfast in the burgh, hands down.

Come hungry with quarters for the meter (25Â¢ / hr) and cash to pay... No plastic accepted here.

You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie - I never enjoy how I feel after eating here but I sure do enjoy the actual eating part! I tend to stick with the corned beef hash, which is SO GOOD. No need to change the routine when something is working for you, right? I've had the pancakes a few times but they always seem too buttery to me but maybe I've just had some bad luck? Obama sure seems to like 'em! After eating the heaping plate of deliciousness I'm usually ready for a nap so I don't make any big post-Pamela's plans. The wait can be long but if you need a Pamela's fix, it's a small price to pay!"}
{"text":"Big Lincoln is the best morning after breakfast in Pittsburgh hands down. It's cash only so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"SO good! Omelet with veggies was tasty, bread tastes homemade, home fries were good, and the pancake are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"i went online and searched for best brunch in town and this place popped up. after reading the reviews i thought i would try out a popular brunch spot in Pittsburgh. Apparently they have multiple locations and obama has been to one of them, however not the at this location..
anyways, i was staying downtown and when i got in the cab the driver told me that this Pamela's was the furthest outside the city, about 4 miles, but i insisted and went anyway.
the restaurant was small, cash only. the food was typical diner breakfast food. i wasn't blown away by anything special. yes their pancakes are crepe style but aside from the small asterisk not much stood out as spectacular. the French toast i ordered was tasty but i had to move the glob of butter they gave me to another plate. the bacon was thin, not thick like i would have suspected for a place that is known for its breakfast food.
i can't say much else that intrigued me."}
{"text":"5 stars. 5 Star chocolate chip pancakes. The best breakfast in Pittsburgh. Just drooling thinking about this place right now. I always get the Big Lincoln, and chocolate chip hot cakes. The potatoes are so legit, it's not even funny! The big Lincoln comes with 2 decent sized hot cakes, 3 eggs, 2 sausage links or bacon, and those potatoes . Add cheese if you want to feel bold about your self . Delicious"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a local. I ordered the \"famous\" corn beef hash and a short stack of the signature pancakes. The corn beef looked gross and had no flavor. The pancakes had a weird after taste. Don't wait in line you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go after a long night of galavanting. Not to anyone's surprise their crepes are the best. The strawberry stuffed crepes are my favorite.

While you are there you can also pick u some tacky Pittsburgh paraphernalia or get your prescription. 

Anywhere Rick Seback goes is a good place in this world."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the strawberry hotcakes.  Here's the thing: the combination of sliced fresh strawberries, sour cream, and brown sugar is sheer genius.  I'll give them that.  But you can do the very same thing AT HOME.  And you can do it without waiting outside in the heat/rain/snow for 20+ minutes, having to have cash on hand, eating your meal sitting practically on a stranger's lap, or wondering what the strange sticky substance on the table is.  Oh, hey, and you can even brew a decent cup of coffee while you're at it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. There's always a line on the weekend but the counter is seat yourself so I can usually squeeze in quickly. If they have croissant french toast on special - GET IT! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful comfort food, friendly service, hearty portions. And the pancakes are really excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to three different Pamela's locations and have never been disappointed. I once had lunch there but for the real Pamela's experience, I go for the breakfast food. The pancakes (crepe-like) are huge and tasty. The eggs are never too greasy and the Lyonnaise potatoes are delicious. When the table orders coffee, you get a carafe for everyone. 

The Squirrel Hill location has especially great service along with its great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Excellent!

I came here while visiting a friend in Pittsburgh over the weekend and Pam's was so good!

Everyone in our group tried the Hot cakes which were delicious. I am not a fan of pancakes in general? But these? THESE I can eat. They are crispy and sugary and not as heavy as pancakes so what I'm trying to say is they're heavenly and if you go, you must try them.

I got the corned beef hash with 2 eggs and toast. It was probably the best corned beef hash I've ever had. It was really filling so the toast wasn't necessary, but all in all the meal was delicious, the prices were reasonable, and the food came out SUPER fast. 

Minus one star because there was a bit of a wait. We expected there to be a wait on the weekends but still... 

The staff was wonderful and I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come at least every Monday and we could not be more satisfied! I especially love the lyonnaise potatoes!! Love this place and I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"When in Pittsburgh, you must have Pamela's! That's what I'd been told and today I can say that I agree.  YOU MUST have Pamela's! It was delicious and the service was great too. 

Now, I'm not one who typically orders pancakes/waffles for breakfast as my palate tends to prefer more savory selections. However, I tasted the blueberry pancakes and was amazed by the flavor and texture combinations. They filled the crepe-like pancakes with a sour cream brown sugar concoction that sent my tastebuds into a blissful whirlwind. It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  I'm looking forward to trying the strawberry pancakes next time."}
{"text":"I like to come here every now and then, it's a far cry from being the best at anything.  But it's quick, cheap, and lacking pretension."}
{"text":"We have been to Pamela's a number of times. The food and the service has slowly deteriorated. Most recently we waited nearly an hour for a table and it was another 45 minutes for our food to be served. The server gave us an excuse that they were trying a new system that all food was delivered at the same time. Rather than delivering the food when it was ready. The eggs were hard and over cooked. The sausage was shriveled and tough. The only entree that was decent were the hotcakes. All in all we won't be back for a long time."}
{"text":"I just don't get the deal? Why all the line ups for a standard greasy spoon diner? I had breakfast there and it wasn't bad, but definitely didn't blow my hair back. Is there something particular I should be ordering when I come here?"}
{"text":"What can you say? It's Pamela's. Have an omelet. Have pancakes. By all means, have the Lyonnaise potatoes. I haven't found anything on the menu that's less than excellent. This one is in the old pharmacy and has plenty of room and plenty of ambiance. Millvale is a nice little town- I have never had trouble parking either. Go."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food!  Had the bacon & cheese omelet with chorizo sausage added to it.  It was excellent along with the lyonnaise potatoes!  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Food is good but I overheard a member of the staff say a racist comment about another worker. I don't think I'll be going back to this location."}
{"text":"If it's good enough for Michelle Obama, it's good enough for me. Her picture remains prominently displayed, and the chair on which she sat is proudly labelled. The strawberry hotcakes made this diner one of the 50 best U.S. breakfast diners, as highlighted by the Food Network Magazine in Fall 2010. My husband gets them every time.  

Truly, this is one of our fave breakfast places in the 'burgh (we also like J'EET, Ritter's Diner, the Square Cafe, the Original Pancake House, depending on what we're in the mood for). This location is our preference among the chain for its easy street parking, a lively atmosphere with the attached pharmacy (and plenty of kitsch), and staff that know our order before we give it. Breakfast can get busy, especially on the weekends, but counter-seating is first available, and generally only a five minute wait even at the busiest times.

So, when we're in the mood for easy, consistent, affordable breakfast diner food, this is our place of choice. We come here so often we feel like we're already living the life of retirees (who are also among the regulars at P&G)."}
{"text":"The best breakfast you can find in the area, hands down. Went here with my family several months ago when it was warm, so there weren't a ton of college kids around nor did we have to wait outside in the cold. That being said, we all loved it here! Not only is it spectacular for breakfast and brunch (try the hotcakes!), what I love about this location of Pamela's is that the walls are completely decked out in Warhol-style murals of famous people like Janis Joplin (and I think the owner?) and old-school board games are attached to the wall as well. 

The space is large, there are two seating areas. That doesn't stop giant lines from forming though, so go early if you can. 

Cash only."}
{"text":"I went here today with my boyfriend for breakfast. We decided to sit at the bar. We noticed our waitress was eating Doritos and heluva good onion dip at 10 AM right in-front of us. She started serving us while chewing on her Doritos and I almost threw up looking at her mouth. She then grabbed napkins and silverware and placed them... when I looked down at my napkin she had Dorito dust smears all over my napkin. We ordered waters and one coffee. She served the coffee with her nasty chip painted fingernails with Dorito hands and touched the entire top of the coffee cup. I do not know how this is acceptable at all. I would never EVER recommend coming to this place. I couldn't believe how disgusting.. and unsanitary this place is. This place needs shut down and that girl needs to eat her Doritos OFF DUTY or never again. Plus she probably shouldn't be eating Doritos at 10 AM."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  Hotcakes are delicious, Lyonaise potatos (home fries) are to die for, and most everything else is near as good.... Except for the coffee!   Which needs some real creamer rather than the dilute milk provided and some extra care with selection and brewing.  But the hotcakes are yummy!!!

Also a very friendly, quick, and quality place to cater from."}
{"text":"There's probably not much to say about Pamela's at this point, but simply put: in my experience this is the absolute best breakfast in Pittsburgh.

We tend to frequent the Millvale location but I've been to them all over the years and I always order the same thing, The Big Lincoln (or the Hangover).

Two eggs over easy, sausage links (my absolute favorite), lyonnaise potatoes, and two crepe style pancakes. I stick with plain, but the stuffed versions with sour cream and brown sugar are great too.

My wife loves their spinach and feta omelette with rye toast.

Friendly staff, quick service, and great prices. You'll have to wait during most visits, but it's rarely more than 10 minutes at this location."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a great place for breakfast food, but expect to intake a large number of calories and fat.  Everything is extremely buttered and you got large servings of everything.  I think that their potatoes could go with a smaller amount of onions."}
{"text":"I have not yet to this day found any breakfast place as good as Pamela's. The crepe-style pancakes with strawberries, brown sugar, sour cream and whipped cream are just to die for. Also notable are the Lyonnaise potatoes. I'm sure there are other good things on the menu, but I've never bothered to order anything else. 
The prices are great! One person plus drink and a side of potatoes is $10-12. 
The waitstaff is friendly, but sometimes overworked. Drink refills are sporadic. The food comes out very quickly, though, so once you're seated, you're usually helped and served pretty fast.
Decor is awesome! The restaurant can tend to be loud, especially on weekend mornings. If you come in a group, make sure everyone in your party is there and ready to be seated, or you could be waiting for quite some time."}
{"text":"After the Uber driver dropped me and my friend downtown he gave us a recommendation to go to the Barrack Obama's favorite diner. It was a 15 minute walk from where we were but it was well worth it. Everything on the menu looked delicious. The service was fantastic.

I had a veggie omelette and it was really well made. My friends also had stunning reviews after the meal. We managed to get in at just the right time because after we left there was a giant line.

Definitely check this place out if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was skeptical about Pamela's pancakes.  How good could they REALLY be?  Were they worth waiting in line, in the cold, for?  Were they worth sitting at the table by the door and being blasted with cold air every thirty seconds?

Yes.  They were.  They were thin and crispy, with plenty of strawberries and delicious brown sugar-sour cream glaze.  They were so good they didn't even need maple syrup.  The potatoes were pretty good too.  The meal was a little pricier than expected, but the food was filling so now I know that next time, I don't need pancakes and a side of potatoes.

Considering how packed this place was at 10:30 on a Saturday morning, we got seated amazingly quickly and service was pretty fast.  It does kind of suck that they're cash only, but there are a number of ATMs on Forbes and Murray.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying the blueberry and banana & chocolate chip pancakes - hopefully at a table a little farther from the door."}
{"text":"We were told by locals that this was the place to go.  So go we did. We went to the one just outside of the city as recommended.

The place is rather large, 1/2 restaurant and 1/2 pharmacy.  We were greeted, seated, and handed menus.  

This seems to be a place locals hit because a of the waitstaff was on first name basis with most people who came in.  This turned out to be something that did not work in our favor.

The waitress came our and took our order.  I had coffee while the wife had water.  I ordered the Banana Walnut hotcakes and she order a veggie omelette.  it did not take too long for our food to come out but that was the last time our waitress visited our table.

Since the place is open we could see the counter and where the food was being prepared.  if you were a local the waitress would come to chat and refill drinks.  I had to ask a passing waitress twice for more coffee while our waitress was behind the counter chatting with other staff.

The food was OK Nothing really extraordinarily.  What the menu calls hotcakes are really Swedish Pancakes (ie crepes).  Mine was just cut up Banana with walnut bits rolled up.  I ended up having chunks of banana for 1 bite then another bits of just the crepe.  The potatoes were very dense which you could see by the pile of potatoes on the grill.  They would just cut off a chunk of the diced potatoes.  My wifes omelette ,again, was just average.

The waitress, who was not our original one, came to pick up the plates and chat.  She was very personable. In fact, every staff person we interacted with was nice.   

Go early. No lines."}
{"text":"Hot cakes are legendary...best I can remember having in a long time. Corned beef hash was world class. Nothing fancy but that's all part of the appeal. Really doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Biiiig biiiiig fan! I love the american breakfast, waffles, crepes, eggs.. And there is no better than place in Squirrel Hill other than Pamela's for a good brunch. Their strawberry hotcakes are the best. Thin crepes with fresh cut strawberries with sugar sprinkled in them...along with a side of their hashbrowns, makes a complete meal. People argue that their food is greasy and I am not going to disagree. But you have been warned!
This restaurant has now been moved to a new bigger place. There is now more room with tables a little apart. 
i would definitely visit again and again, every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I love Pamela's. But this location can't compare to the others I've been to. I'm usually not a snob when it comes to waiting for food, but waiting over 30 minutes for pancakes, when every other location has you your food in less than 10? No thanks"}
{"text":"I love it here! My fiance and I eat here all the time. We always get the strawberry pancakes, potatoes, and sausage.  Everything is always delicious.  It's amazing, just amazing.  just be prepared -- people love this place, so there is often a line on the weekend. But don't be intimidated, it moves quickly!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The crepes Tyler pancakes with the crispy edges are to die for & the lyonnaise potatoes are like Crack. Yum!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast while visiting a friend in Pittsburgh.  Man, was it fabulous.  I had the blueberry pancakes, my wife had the strawberry pancakes.  They are *so* delicious.  The whole outer inch of the pancakes were crispy, the berries were fresh.  They're thin, chewy, crispy circles of wonder.  Service was good and pretty fast."}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes.

I have never had anything melt in my mouth like these hot cakes. I went with the banana walnut cakes and they were thin and slightly crispy. Almost crepe like. Not your typical pancake, but they were out of this world.

If you like breakfast or brunch, this is a must stop in the U.S.

The atmosphere is what you would expect at a diner. Very simple and retro. Good place to bring a group."}
{"text":"We had a good visit here last week. Like many others have noted, the pancakes are unique and very good. I loved the buttery flavor and crispy edges. I would have preferred fresh-cut strawberries in my pancakes instead of the syrupy ones. We ordered a fruit bowl for our one year old daughter but it seemed a little overpriced for what it was. The bacon was very thin - I like a thicker cut myself. 

This is an unusual location as it's found inside a pharmacy. The employees were pleasant to deal with. Can't say it was my favorite breakfast ever but it was certainly worth the stop. This is a cash-only joint, so bring your dollars!"}
{"text":"Super good food.  I always get a Greek inlet if I am trying to eat healthy lol!  Their blueberry pancakes are amazing."}
{"text":"This will forever be my favorite breakfast diner in Pittsburgh. I usually always get the bacon and cheddar omelette but the hot cakes are a house specialty and are tasty. Pamela's also has the best home-fries so definitely make sure your plate comes with a side!"}
{"text":"Cute little place! Had almost of cool pictures on the wall. Food was good. Was a little wait. And they do only breakfast on Sundays and only take cash! So bring crash"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of Pamela's.  The crowded atmosphere is nice, but the food is pretty mediocre, and the service kinda sucks.  I'll go back, but there are better breakfast places to be found in the 'burgh.

(And it's another Pittsburgh business that doesn't take credit cards.  What's with this?  Is it 1990 here?  Most of the places I went to regularly in La Paz, Bolivia, take credit cards.)"}
{"text":"Is there anyone in Pittsburgh doing breakfast better than Pamela's? NOPE

Get a friend and share an order of Tex-Mex omelette with lyonnaise potatoes and banana hot cakes, and never look back. If you can't find a friend, call me."}
{"text":"Tremendous value and service for your breakfast dollar! Their pancakes served thin w/ buttery crispy edges are legendary. Pam & Gale, the original owners of all Pamela's Diners in the area, have even served up those luscious cakes for Michelle Obama - you can ask to see the chair she sat in upon her first visit now emblazoned w/ her name on a brass plate.

The very best item to order is the Lincoln Big Breakfast w/ two eggs over easy/scrambled, three pieces of bacon/sausage/ham, their butter drenched onion and potato Lyonnaise homefries AND two scrumptious pancakes. It will keep you satiated for a whole day.

They execute well w/ roving coffee refills from very friendly staff. I love Pamela's at all locations. They serve great homestyle breakfast and lunch in visually interesting places.

Ladies room is unisex and tucked away in the back reaches of the building. Pretty clean and stocked but TP was on a little hot water heater across from the commode which kind of makes me twitchy but not itchy! Ha!"}
{"text":"Pretty fabulous diner food. The pancakes are crispy and delicious.  I also love their Pittsburgh hash.  It is a consistently delicious Pittsburgh staple."}
{"text":"I love the Studio54 decor of this place!  The service was good.  I also love the open kitchen.  Unfortunately, the food (I had the beef hash) was ridiculously greasy.  Granted, it tasted very good and was made with real ingredients (not from a can).   I am still investigating whether it was the exhorbinant amount of grease, or if my order was laced with Prozac.   Do not eat the food unless you do not require a working nervous system for the rest of your day.  I foolishly went to this diner to order breakfast food for breakfast.

I may return whenst hungover."}
{"text":"Potatoes were really good, despite them not being well done like I asked. My wife seemed to enjoy her chorizo hash. However I ordered a classic Bacon, Eggs toast combo and was very dissatisfied with the bacon and eggs, Ordered Over medium and it was completely fried,  i understand thick cut is tough to make crispy but more effort could have been done. When it first came out I immediately noticed it was very undercooked and floppy, I politely asked it be made crispy to which the waitress said sure no problem. Less than 2 minutes later the cook or food runner comes out with my bacon and it's literally slightly hotter and cooked like 4 % more. No where near crispy. I leave it there as I can't eat bacon that way. Moments before we leave? The couple next to us gets their food and their bacon was CRISPY and perfect. I could here it crunch as she ate it. So obviously the communication between the cook and waitress wasn't there....or the cook Just didn't give a shit. Either way, I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best pancakes, or hotcakes it says on the menu, in the USA. Service is excellent & friendly. 

I came here for breakfast 2 years ago when I was on tour with a band from Brooklyn, performing at Mr.Smalls down the street. I recalled The Big Lincoln on the menu - eggs, potatoes, meat of choice and pancakes. 
So good and so much food for your bucks!

Today I especially made a detour to have breakfast at Pamela's. It was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Fooderies are subjective.  This place is nothing special.  I guess I just don't get the hype.  
The food was good but nothing I would wait an hour and 15 in line again.
Had the banana walnut hot cakes with 'the morning after'.  My boyfriend's croissant French toast was more like caramel soup.  Just not our style!  
Good portions, pricing, diner feel.  Just didn't WOW me.  Probably wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"Great food ! If you are looking for a heavy nice bruch/breakfast this the place ! Price is reasonable which gives you homestyle food. Atmosphere is traditional, drug store and t-shirts sale beside foods"}
{"text":"Large portion as expected and the wait for the table is not as long as other Pamela's location.

We decided to stop by Pamela's for breakfast but chose this location in Millvale because other locations, especially in Shadyside, tended to get long lines over the weekend. As we expected, we showed up around 8am and there was just a party or two in line ahead of us..so it wasn't too bad. It also helped that this restaurant is located in the same building as a drugstore...so I could browse around a bit and not get bored waiting in line...which was just about 10 min max.

I found the waiters and waitresses to be nice and courteous. They promptly took our orders...but..the bad part was...the good took forever to arrive at our table!! I wanted to say it must have been at least 30 min after we sat down before we all got our food. Food was good..large portion as you can always expect from Pamela's..but I suspect they suffer from a small kitchen..which literally forced the wait time for food to be a bit unbearable to me especially for a simple meal like breakfast.

Overall, decent breakfast..though I'm not sure if going to this location would actually save that much wait time..given you still have to wait for a long time for the food to arrive anyways."}
{"text":"This place is without a doubt the best breakfast in Pittsburgh!  Walked in this morning to a longer than normal line, but it moved along quickly due to the staff hustling to turn tables around. And while you're waiting there's lots to look at in the Lincoln Pharmacy, that's in the same space. Great food, neat space and a hard working staff = the best!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch on a weekend trip to Pittsburgh. I was pleasantly surprised that the wait time was less than ten minutes for such a popular restaurant on a weekend. I got the seafood omelette and Nutella french toast. Food was very good and service was great. Go here for an indulgent breakfast, and don't even think about the calories."}
{"text":"I go to Pamela's every time I visit Pittsburgh. I've only ever gotten the pancakes (with chocolate chips and bananas). Get those, you will not regret it. As for the other reviews and other food, I haven't experience it so I cannot comment on that. It is a small place and rather crowded so get there early before the Pitt students wake up. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great place to get brunch. I've had the fruit stuffed crepes and the homemade corned beef and hash, and highly recommend both. They get pretty busy, but are good at keeping the crowds moving without making you feel rushed."}
{"text":"I come to Pittsburgh at least two times a year and my cousin always makes it a point to bring me here, the portions are big and the prices are reasonable, great service, and great food, try their famous potatoes, soooo good, always look forward to breakfast here."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite breakfast spots in Pittsburgh and I do not come here nearly enough. I think it beats the other locations by a mile in regards to service and size of the establishment.  This one is located in Millvale off of the beaten path of your standard popular downtown Pittsburgh locations, but it is worth the trip (and it is actually closer to my house than any of the other ones so it's a win-win for me).  There are a lot of tables and it is alwayssss busy, but we've never had to wait more than 20-30 minutes - and if you've been to Pamelas in any other part of town, that's not bad at all.

During my most recent visit with my mom, we were seated immediately.  Our service has always been excellent.  My mom and I always order the chocolate chip banana hotcakes to split and we both get a different omelette.  My favorite is the Tex-Mex and it comes stuffed with delicious chili/chorizo and cheese, plus a heaping scoop of guac on top with the famous lyonnaise potatoes and toast.  It is truly a size that could feed a small army and I think its under $10.

Pamela's is a Pittsburgh staple and if you're in town, you must stop in to try it. The hype is for real.  Cash only I think at (all) locations.  Get the hotcakes to split, too. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Right in line with the Pamela's tradition.  I will say, even on a weekday morning they do get busy which can lead to slower service.  But the good food comes out of the kitchen quickly and the portions here seem a tad bigger than some of the other Pamela's locations."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place gets such good reviews. I went once, wasn't impressed, but given all the hype around it, thought my (unimpressive) experience must have been an outlier so this week I went again. 

The food is completely ordinary and completely overpriced. I had a turkey club sandwich for ~$8. The sandwich was ok, nothing special. And the sides - wait, there were no sides. For $8, I got just a small deli sandwich. My child got a chicken sandwich for ~$7. It was a generic bun with what was a pre made chicken finger that anyone might buy in the frozen food isle of the grocery store. With no sides. For $7.  I could go on but it would be more of the same. In the end, I spent $50 for 4 sandwiches, 1 order of fries, and 3 drinks. 

All I can say is fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I should have learned my lesson after my first visit."}
{"text":"I have been to all of the \"Pamela's\" diners in the Pittsburgh area, and this one is HANDS DOWN the absolute best. Once you eat here, you will never want to eat at the Pamela's in Oakland, The Strip, or Squirrel Hill ever again. 

I dont know what it is about this place, but the food served at this Pamela's is exponentially better than the food served at other Pamela's (particularly Oakland's location - no watered-down coffee or rubbery eggs here!). The portions are huge, food comes out hot, and the coffee is strong. What else could you possibly need?! 

The other thing I love about this location is that they include their famous lyonnaise potatoes with their \"Big Lincoln\" breakfast special, which is essentially the \"Morning After\" special at the Oakland Pamela's, which doesn't include the potatoes. I  know this is minor but I hated having to always pay for side of potatoes (because who can leave Pamela's without having a taste of those!?). Everything here is fantastic: lunch specials, pancakes, omelets etc. Never have had one thing here that wasn't on point. 

This location is larger and open (not as cramped as some of the other locations), housed inside of the old Lincoln Pharmacy in Millvale. Tall ceilings, a whole wall of windows and the old soda fountain at the front of the diner make for a fun and unique atmosphere. 

Of course there is always \"the wait\" if you are going for any weekend morning breakfast or brunch, but with Pamela's that's to be expected. No big deal. Tables turn fast here and we once went to this location with over 10 people in our party on a Sunday morning and waited only about 40 minutes. The other good thing about this location is that there is room to stand in line in the pharmacy..you can buy old school candy, knick knacks, and cheesy Pittsburgh themed gifts. Its not a bad wait at all. 

Be sure to give this location a try and put it to the test of the other Pamela's in the area, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with any of the pancakes or eggs. Food and service is average but it's the type of place you have to go to at least once if you're visiting Pittsburgh. The sign outside says \"P&G Diner\" (they have a few locations in the area) but it's Pamela's. It's located on the corner of the block and attached to a pharmacy with plenty of street parking."}
{"text":"The food is just as good here (or better) than the other Pamela's.  There is sometimes a line, but it moves quickly.  The restaurant is located in a old fashioned pharmacy.  Love the crepe pancakes and the home fried potatoes.  This is a cash only restaurant, but there is an ATM located in the Pharmacy.  Jean-Marc Chatellier's French Bakery is across the street, and that's always worth a visit."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just spoiled but this place is sub par. Been to the one in Sq. Hill were there is line on the weekends and a wait of anywhere from 10 -30 min. I've only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking \"I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1/4 of what I payed at Pamela's\"."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place.  It's a Pamela's that inside an old drug store.  Same old great food, with a TON of character.  There's actually an old fashioned soda fountain in this place.  I had an excellent spinach and feta omelette that came with the best home fries.  Not sure what they did to them, but they were crispy the way I like them.  If you find yourself driving through Millvale, it's definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Really good pancakes, easy to enter and move the stroller around, super friendly staff, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It's as good as the others but shorter lines and less waiting time. Great alternative to the Strip location if your parents are visiting and you want to avoid an hour long conversation of mundane banter related to how busy it is today."}
{"text":"I can't believe the less than great reviews for Pamela's.  I also can't believe that I've never reviewed this place before, despite it being right around the corner from me.

Well I woke up yesterday with an appetite for a really good breakfast.  So borrowing an idea from a really good friend of mine, I decided to take my guy out to eat.  Well he must have really had a great appetite himself because he ordered the bannana walnut pancakes.  Carbs!  Calories!  Fat!  (Mmmm, just thinking about that--Pump that insulin Susan!  Pump!).  

Well I am a type-1 diabetic and even though I opted for the slightly less carb-a-lish-ous pancakes and an egg on the side, I still was pumping that insulin 'cos their 'cakes are s-o-o-o-o good!  The menu even bills them as The Devil's Carb Corner!  Hey, a girl can't eat just scrambled eggs all her life!  

A couple of things though.  Pamela's does have a lunch menu, but they don't serve these on Sunday.  Also the place is \"CASH ONLY\" so be sure to stop at the ATM beforehand."}
{"text":"A great alternative to going to Pamela's in the strip if you don't want to wait for a table. This P&G has a lot of the same menu items like the crepe style hot cakes and lyonnaise potatoes, as well as a variety of omelets. It's also an old school pharmacy, which adds some charm. The service is good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"\"My name is Barack Obama and I approve this restaurant.\"  
- The President of the United States

Alright, so I totally made up that quote, although it is true that Obama did make a stop at Pamela's while visiting Pittsburgh and loved it.  But even though I voted for the guy, I can't say that I'm with him on this one.  

Pamela's is just okay.  Pretty much everything on the menu is standard and over-the-top greasy.  Even their so-called famous hotcakes fail to dazzle my taste buds, and I can assure you that my taste buds are not particularly discriminating, especially during the time that I lived in Pittsburgh as a broke college student.  I don't really get the hype and why there is always an obscenely long wait.  The decor is pretty wacky and fun, I guess?"}
{"text":"waitress was nice. Food service was quick. The famous  lyonaisse  potatoes are a  big glop  of tastelessness   Eggs and omelets  Good A neighborhood place resting on its former reputation"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!  Perfectly cooked eggs and sausage, giant crepe-like pancakes, good strong coffee, and costs next to nothing!  Can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"Who are these people that are doubting the power of Pamela's?!? It's all about the breakfast food. It's all about the POTATOES!! I think I have a soft spot for this location in particular (which, I think, has better POTATOES) because I use to live down the street, but either way, it's diner food with a superior delicious factor.

Yes, there is a wait, but welcome to Pittsburgh. Any good breakfast/brunch spot has a wait between 12 and 3 on weekends. Just go early or late and you'll be fine. I've never waited more than 15 minutes or so, even if there were people in front of me. The service is fast. The staff is accommodating. The food is delicious (get any of the omelets or the pancakes - those thin pancakes are to die for). In fact, on my latest visit to Pittsburgh, I INSISTED that we stop at Pamela's first thing so I could get my fave omelet and those fantabulous potatoes. You'll love it! Dig in and enjoy guys."}
{"text":"Wow...there are some seriously mixed reviews on here about this Pamela's location...what a shame.

Yes, there's nothing quite \"special\" about this place - aside from the fact that it's a Pittsburgh tradition.  The place is small and the line is usually out the door (especially if you wake up late), but there aren't many diners in Pittsburgh and this one is bright and cheerful...to say nothing of being inexpensive.

I looked over the other reviews given to this place and most of the questionable ratings were given by people from out of town or with unreasonable expectations.  For example, Louis P. writes \"...what you'd expect if you went to IHOP or Bob Evans...\"  That is completely untrue.  The quality of food, the service and the experience are all several levels above those CHAIN establishments.  And you also have to keep in mind that you are patronizing a locally & independently owned/operated business.  This place has real character and is a fixture of the community.

Go here for the crowd, go here to see cute little kids play with their food, go here to support a local business, go here for the quality (inexpensive) food.  Just go here.  Sure, you could make you're own breakfast and save a little money/time...but if that's what you want, don't complain about Pamela's or compare it to sub-par chains.

Things to keep in mind:

- Bring cash but it's not as big of a hassle as other reviewers suggest...there are two banks across the street and two more down the block.
- I recommend the omelets.
- Arrive early, the line grows quickly."}
{"text":"I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the Pamela's locations. I have gone to the Strip location more times than any of the others though I think this location is really cool. Half diner, half old-timey pharmacy. Went here today with a friend and were seated at the bar immediately. Service was quick. Food was great. The crepe-style pancakes/hotcakes are just the best."}
{"text":"Have you ever moved across the country and missed a breakfast place so much you think a 500 dollar plane ticket sounds like a reasonable way to attain said breakfast? 

I miss Pamela's!!!

I never liked pancakes until I had them here. These things aren't pancakes...pancakes are just spongier eggos without the tic tac pattern. What Pamela's makes are excursions to ecstacy-land! They are thin but not quite crepe-thin with a vanilla-ey flavor that is singular and delicious. I garauntee you haven't had a \"pancake\" like this before, and if you move away from the burgh, sadly, you never will again. 

My crazy best friend insisted we bring our own 100% maple syrup which isn't necessary to love these babies but why eat caviar with wonder bread? (In that analogy, Pam's cakes are the caviar and the provided syrup is the wonder bread.) 

We also loved the breakfast potatoes, but discovered you had to ask for them \"well done\" for them to be optimal. This meant that we often recieved them AFTER our hot cakes and to be honest, it was seldom that our orders were perfectly or efficiently executed, but that didn't stop us from waiting outside in the freezing rain for half an hour to get a table. 

I didn't come for lunch. That's just crazy talk. You come for the pancakes. Especially if you don't like pancakes."}
{"text":"\"Dude get the 'morning after' breakfast\" my friend says... What is it? he says \"Don't worry trust me\" ...

Most of the time this scenerio has a bad ending, but this time I am glad I took my stoner friend's advice.  The morning after breakfast is their banana, chocolate chip pancakes with bacon, egg and sausage... It was so so so so good!!!!

If you're coming to visit Pittsburgh you have to go to Pamelas.  My only gripe about it is that for a breakfast place they open late.  7:30am!!!"}
{"text":"Their pancakes are awesome with specialty flavors. Their omelet is very weak. If you come for the pancakes you will be very happy, anything else and I think you will be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Always good diner food. Not sure about the lunch food, since I always get breakfast at a diner, but the breakfast is good!"}
{"text":"I'm fairly easy to please when it comes to breakfast foods. And I go for the basic - bacon, eggs, homefries and toast. When my friends and I sat down at a table to decide, I was told I either need to get the strawberry hotcakes or something with homefries because there's just something about the way Pamela's does potatoes that's right.

One of my friends ordered the hotcakes and *promised* me a bite. So I went with my staple - bacon, eggs, homefries and toast. If we're being honest here, I wasn't -THAT- wowed by the potatoes. I mean, they were tasty but I didn't really find them remarkable. And I looooove potatoes (perhaps too much)...so it was a bit disappointing. Maybe I was expecting too much or maybe they just weren't that good that day. My bacon was crisp and my eggs were cooked perfectly so no other issues there. My coffee was constantly refilled so that was also a plus. 

Oh and as for my bite of strawberry-hotcake-goodness? I looked up and over at my friend's plate to find it completely empty! \"Sorry, Alicia...I was just too hungry. There was that last bite and...well, I didn't even think twice before I ate it.\"

I feel meh about the homefries but I guess the hotcakes here are the bees knees."}
{"text":"Great little greasy spoon diner spot in Millvale! Don't be intimidated by the line. Every breakfast spot in the city gets super crowded from 10am-1pm but this place gets you in and out pretty quickly! Plus, there is a bunch of super corny Yinzer Pittsburgh merchandise that you can look at while you wait.

Service was great, all the staff was very friendly and the food was filling and delicious."}
{"text":"I have warm and fuzzy memories of coming in here and staring up at the Village People while I nursed my hangovers. That is not a typo. Hangovers. Plural. I had a great time living in Pittsburgh. You only live once, so eat at Pamela's."}
{"text":"My main goal when going to Pamela's was to get a giant plate of the lyonnaise potatoes. Sure, the pancakes, crepes, eggs, etc are very tasty, but those potatoes made the struggle to find parking in Oakland, trip to get cash beforehand (no credit cards!), wait in line and occasionally slow service 100% worth it."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Large under-seasoned platters of eggs and toast. The ingredients are extremely low quality. Nothing is homemade. Margarin instead of butter. Arguably the most overrated Pittsburgh chain. We just have terrible diners in this city so they don't even need to try. If you go stick to the pancakes and potatoes."}
{"text":"Super cute but food was way too sweet. Not our style! Loved the 50's diner deco and location in the Strip District though!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the chocolate chip & banana pancakes, chorizo hash and lemonade! So yummy! Only accepts cash..if they accepted cards it would be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"To put things in perspective - the freaking President of the United States recently served these pancakes *at the White House.* The only other food I've ever consumed that could claim that was Legal Seafood's clam chowder - and just as thinking of returning to Boston makes me long for that chowder, these pancakes have made my move to Pittsburgh that much less painful.

Just try the damn pancakes. If you don't like them, they only set you back $6 or so. But odds are, you'll like them. The rest of the menu is nothing special, but having a good pancake is enough to get 5 stars in my book. My only nitpick is that they do the Southern-style \"pay at the register\" thing, which I haven't seen much of in Pittsburgh (so it feels out of place) - but if that really bothers you enough to affect your rating, take my advice: never eat south of the Mason-Dixon line."}
{"text":"I fell for the positive reviews. I will never return to a Pamela's ever again. My husband and I waited in line for a long time to get a table. We were finally sat down and placed our order. Quite some time passed before my Belgian Waffle came out, and my husband sat there staring at me while I ate my food and he waited even longer for his food. He eventually waved over a waitress, and she explained that my waffle cooks faster than his omelet does. Why did the cooks not cook the food so that the two dishes came out at the same time? Finally my husband's Tex Mex Omelet came out. It was, as he described, \"disgusting\" and \"watery in the center\". His side potatoes did not taste good. My specialty Belgian Waffle with strawberries and bananas had nothing special about it at all. The price was expensive for the quality. There are much better breakfast restaurants in Pittsburgh. By the way, they are cash only."}
{"text":"I love Pamela's.  Like Sarah Beth (see review below), I pine for it when I'm far away and make it one of my all-important stops whenever I'm in Pgh. for a visit.  There are four (or five?) locations, but this location in the heart of Squirrel Hill remains my favorite; the Shadyside location on Walnut Street is a close second.  Unfortunately, one reason S.H.'s store was my favorite was because of its unassuming decor--this summer I stopped in and it had completely changed.  Expect now to see gigantic John Travolta paintings (album cover recreated), disco balls, and eye-jarring colors.  It's cool, but more apt for a weekend-long party than a full-time restaurant.  Bring back the middle-class diner look!

So you think you don't like pancakes?  You're in my boat, friend.  I don't really dig 'em myself.  I tried the famous pancakes at Pamela's expecting to ditch them and move forward, but I got hooked.  They're amazing.  Very huge in their circumference but ever-so-thin in width.  They taper out so that the edges are crepey and crispy and oh-so-delectable.  I LOVE THE PANCAKES.  I want some now.  

The combination breakfasts are ridiculously affordable.  Pancakes, eggs, and bacon or sausage.  

As I recall, the coffee ain't so terrific.  Maybe that's changed by now, but I used to get coffee before or after at the Coffee Tree across the street if I really wanted some."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me almost five years of living in Pittsburgh before finally getting to Pamela's.
We visited at lunch time and while it was busy it wasn't overwhelmingly so.
My first comment has to be about how accommodating the staff was.  My twin toddlers always sit in high chairs but that day my daughter declared \"I big now\" and refused so the server got us boosters instead.  Then my daughter threw her milk purposely on the floor.  I apologized profusely but our server cleaned up the mess without complaint.  A server who brought part of our to go order also rang us out so I didn't need to walk to the register with my crazies in tow.  It was a huge help.  Their attention and kindness was appreciated and I reflected that in the tip.
Everything on the menu sounded amazing so it was tough to come to a decision.  When I did I chose the strawberry pancake for the kids and the chorizo hash for me.  The hash came with your choice of eggs and toast.  Not that I'd know that because my kids gobbled up both (so I guess they were good).  The chorizo hash was full of flavor and had just the right amount of kick.
The strawberry pancake was heaven on a plate.  W, actually over a plate because it actually overhung the plate.  It was full of flavor and juicy, fresh strawberries.  Amazing.  I got a to go order of the potatoes because they are \"famous\" and I'm glad I did because they were incredible.
The one thing to note is that they are cash only.  Not to worry, though, because there is an ATM on premises.
It was an amazing dining experience and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. The most unique pancakes I've ever eaten. Wonderful corned beef hash. Great breakfast potatoes. Super efficient. Food is out to you quickly, and it's always hot. Really friendly, caring staff. 

I'd come here for breakfast everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Pamela's is incredibly delicious. Those crepe style pancakes melt on your tongue and despite them being so thin, they are very filling. If you eat a Pamela's breakfast, be prepared not to eat anything else that day. The potatoes are crazy good, made with onions and magic and who knows what else, but they taste like heaven. Wish I had that recipe! If you are from Pittsburgh, I'm guessing you could sing Pamela's praises. If you are visiting Pittsburgh, this is THE place to have breakfast/brunch. Yes, they have a lunch menu. But why order a sandwich at a breakfast place? If a place is known to be one of the best at something, why fight it? I'm judging you.
This location is not my favorite. It's unique in that it's inside a functional old timey drug store. There isn't a ton of seating and the line backs up and winds around the store, which is awkward. The Pamela's in the strip is superior as far as expedited seating and service. But if you are in Millvale and don't mind waiting near the NyQuil, grab some pancakes and potatoes. Cash only!"}
{"text":"I want to start my reviews of Pittsburgh stating that I love it.  Not for the food, not for the ngiht life, but for the fact that I have such fantastic friends living there who make it an amazing, fun, carefree experience to visit them.  They also get really excited about food in Pittsburgh, and after an amazing night out where we slept at 530 AM we woke up and decided to go for brunch at the famous Pamela's.  
We walked in to a large diner, with the smell of corned beef, eggs and browned sugar welcoming us.
After perusing the menu and looking around me, I decided on the corned beef and swiss omelette, the onion rings and a blueberry crepe order to share with Georges.  Andrea ordered eggs with bacon and ham (yes both), as Alejandro, and Georges ordered the chorizo patties with eggs.  After adding an extra order of lyonnaise potatoes we decided to start with those.
The food was...well disappointing.  Everything was covered in margarine (not butter, not olive oil but margarine), the chorizo was greasy, and the pancakes were beyond disappointing, shooting into the land of mediocrity whose anthem starts with \"you must be kidding, these are famous?\"
The only things I liked were the onion rings and the lyonnaise potatoes which were only ok, but compared to the rest were-well, better.
I will be back to Pittsburgh to see everyone I love very much, but I do not think Pamela and I will meet again."}
{"text":"Just down the street from the venue I was working at while on tour. Perfect diner breakfast, just what I needed!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out and I'm really glad we did! The layout is kind of awkward, there is the diner on one side and the pharmacy on the other side. And in the middle is a bunch of Pittsburgh themed trinkets for purchase. There are two doors and we entered in what was probably the exit door because we had to walk through the diner to get to where people were waiting to be seated. There was a line, but we didn't have to wait very long.
We ordered a Lincoln breakfast and a Tex mex omelette. Both were good, I would say the pancakes and sausage were my favorite parts of the Lincoln breakfast. The omelette was good too. I wasn't too crazy about the potatoes, but it seemed like others loved them so I guess it's just preference. It was very busy so the service was a little delayed, but I will say that we never had to ask for a refill, they were very prompt with that. 
We will definitely return, I want to try some of their other dishes as well as a milkshake. This place had such a great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in Pamela's today. I got the Tex Mex Omelet.  This was my favourite, one of the main reasons I go there for breakfast. The filling was all salsa. It was not good.  I never minded the price because of how good it was. It was not worth the money this time."}
{"text":"the lyonnaise potatoes are worth the trip alone. great breakfast spot, the wait in line can be long, and you'll have to wait a pretty decent amount of time for your food too, so i wouldn't advise coming completely starving. Phosphates are really good and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Who, living in Pittsburgh for more than a minute, doesn't know about the famous Pamela's Diner? Sadly, it has taken me actual decades to get to one. (To be fair, I lived out of the state for a good chunk of that time.) I started coming to the Millvale location several weeks ago, and to my delight, the food lives up to its reputation. What I like best are the pancakes.  Just plain pancakes...or ARE they? They are crepe-thin and have these crispy edges that keep me coming back for more. Seriously, the first time I went, I ordered some special filled pancakes, and then put in ANOTHER ORDER FOR MORE BECAUSE I AM A PANCAKE MONSTER. 

Their Lyonnaise potatoes are renowned, though I'd say they are just slightly above average for my taste.  They are usually best accompanied by an omelette, and they have plenty of those plus a rotational special.

FYI, as with all good breakfast diners, they get busy by 10am, but the tables turn over fast.  It's cash only, and they do have an ATM in house."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! 
came here sunday for brunch, they apparently ONLY serve brunch/breakfast menu items on sundays. I ordered the morning after special; two eggs sunnyside up, sausage and banana walnut hot cakes with a side of their home fried potatoes.

The sunny side up eggs and sausage were pretty standard but their hotcakes were amazing!  It was two hotcakes rolled up like a crepe, stuffed with banana walnuts and whipped cream, tasted like banana ice cream heaven! Haha! 

Their home styled potatoes were delicious too! It's moist, gooey and flavorful. They're just potatoes, yea... but really good ones! Order it!

The service was great too! Food comes pretty quickly and my favorite part is when you have a large group and want to split the check, just line up at the register with the check and they'll ring each person up individually! I've never seen that before. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows Pamela's is a Pittsburgh institution, and rightfully so. Their pancakes are amazing, and \"The Big Lincoln\" might be the best bang for the buck breakfast in the state of Pennsylvania, if not beyond.

I went off book though the last time I was there and got the Chorizo Hash. It was flavorful and an ample portion.  If you've never been though, you have to try the pancakes. So large yet so thin, and those crispy edges. That's what they're known for. Oh, and the Obamas ate there while in town years ago.

To be fair, I've never been to any of the other locations besides Millvale. We never wait too long there, even when there's a line and can usually find parking on the street with relative ease. Will return again and again. I'm sure the other locations are just as good though."}
{"text":"man, this place is GOOD.  its cheap and tasty, the only downside is that its pretty small so there's often a line for brunch on saturday and sunday.  my favorite thing there is the banana walnut hotcakes (basically, hotcakes are like thin pancakes, maybe its a pittsburgh thing)"}
{"text":"We are frequent diners at Pamela's. We really enjoy this place, and we are glad it is close to us.

Yes, the wait can be fairly long. However, I don't think we've had to wait longer than 15 minutes at their new location on Murray. We are generally a smaller party, which helps.

The crepe-style pancakes are terrific. The crunchy outside of the pancakes are a nice touch, and they are very flavorful. Their Lyonnaise potatoes are some of the best I've had. The rest of the menu is pretty good, but these are the standouts.

The service is always very good. We've gotten to know some of the staff working here, and they always take time to say hello and give our daughter a big hug. We really just love them. In addition, we generally receive our food very fast, which is great as we are usually starving when we get here.

Yeah, they are cash only, but that helps keep the prices down. And there are at least 4 banks right around the corner with ATMs. It's not that hard to get cash around here. Not a big deal to me.

Not sure this is the best breakfast ever (or even in Pittsburgh). But the food is really good, very reliable, and the service is excellent. It's our local breakfast place for a reason."}
{"text":"Pancakes were off the hook. Those will bring me back for sure.  They're very thin,  almost crepe like. What I won't order again are the potatoes.  They were a killed mushy mess with raw onions scattered throughout. Typical diner coffee, nothing special.  Service was fast and friendly.    If it weren't for the hotcakes I wouldn't go back, but they made up for the taters and joe."}
{"text":"I love breakfast! 
This place is so nostalgic in appearance and energy!

My goodness the pancakes are thin and delicious !
The breakfast potatoes are soooo good ! 

Great meal! 

Where else can you get food, shop and have prescriptions filled ????"}
{"text":"Greasy, greasy, salty, sugary, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"grew up in sq hill.. ate here, hung out here(video games)  this place =best breakfasts ever.....their lunch... I actually crave the cheeseburgers and fries from time to time.. need to get back sometime"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pancakes - thin, with crispy edges. Service was fast and friendly. Hamburger sliders were not great - very \"institutional\" patties, with some grilled onions; bigger than expected for sliders. I'd stick with the breakfast food and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh over new years and planned on indulging on all the great food PA has to offer and this place did not disappoint! Let's start with the fact that I don't order pancakes. If they come with a breakfast platter, I'll eat a few bites. 

We are seated and I see all these people eating super thin, crepe like pancakes. Now I'm intrigued! So I go against my norm and order a short stack. Let's just say this place put my belief back into pancakes. They were amazing! Extremely thin cake with crunchy edges is something I've never had before and I'm sold. Great job P&G. If we make it back to Pittsburgh you'll be my first food stop."}
{"text":"Went here on a very cold Saturday afternoon with my fiance and her aunt.  I've been here several times during the lunch/brunch hour on the weekend and very single time it's a decent half hour wait to get a seat.  Make sure you put your name in when you get there and for you to be seated your whole party has to be present.

Pamela'ls is an excellent place for breakfast! It's styled like a 1960's diner with old pictures all around the walls and some very unique colors to the restaurant.  This place has by far the best hotcakes I have ever had!  I'd highly recommend the strawberry or chocolate chip and banana hotcakes.  They are really thin but will fill you up.  All 3 of us ordered hotcakes for our meals and were very pleased with both the quality of the food and the service by the staff at such a busy time.  

Pamela's is a beautiful Pittsburgh staple.  A unique atmosphere, excellent food, great staff make this place easy to return to time and time again."}
{"text":"What more can be said about Pamela's that hasn't already been said? This greasy diner is the best breakfast in the 'burgh.  I've been to multiple locations and they are all consistently good so you can't go wrong.  Everything I've ever ordered from here has been dynamite.  The pancakes are a staple - super buttery, plate sized, thin & crispy.  How every pancake should be.  The omelets are cheesy and just melt in your mouth.  
I don't know if anyone orders lunch items from here - I can't imagine waiting for a table (which can take a long time) and not getting breakfast but who knows. I'd be surprised if they turned out anything less than amazing.  Definitely a day to wear loose fitting pants though!"}
{"text":"Pamela's Diner has been around longer than I have. In her 30+ years, she's mastered some mighty tasty dishes and it appears, quite the following. 

I had the pleasure of brunching at the Strip District location over the holiday weekend. They were fairly busy but the line was manageable and worth it. 

How about those sweet fry cakes? 
Dessert for breakfast? Yes, please. Splitsies? Yes, please. I specifically recommend the chocolate banana variety. I'm still thinking about those buttery crispy edges. That's where the magic happens.

Trying to kick a hangover? Fancy yourself some kielbasa? Go BIG. Order the Pittsburgh Hash: a healthy serving/mixture of kielbasa, potatoes and sauerkraut paired with eggs and toast. Sweatpants and a to go box are also recommended. 

Two other notes: I appreciated the price point of $9-$12 -- manageable and justifiable given the portion sizes and creativity of the dishes I experienced. Cash only!! $$$
 
Only drawback? The ladies restroom was in need of some TLC."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but I ordered an omelette with veggies and I could tell that they were caned. They only take cash which is a bummer."}
{"text":"The have a fantastic belgian waffle! Crispy and delish! The lyonnaise potatoes are a must. I don't even want to think about how unhealthy they must be because they taste delicious! They have fantastic specials that rotate on a 5 week basis. The weekend we were there they had peach melba hotcakes. My dad drove from WV to try them out, and he LOVED them! Be prepared to wait if you visit for breakfast on the weekend! But, even though the line stretched all the way to the back of the pharmacy when we arrived, we didn't wait more than half an hour for a table. It moves quickly, most people are really considerate of those who are waiting in line and vacate quickly after finishing their meals. The food arrived very quickly, service was very friendly and on top of all our needs. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We live so close to Pamelas that I can literally almost touch the building from my bathroom window, so needless to say we eat breakfast here a lot. For breakfast, this place gets 5 stars, simply for the food. The service  is usually terrible and they use margarine instead of butter (GROSS), but it's excellent diner food. Lunch however is a totally different story. I ordered a 7 or 8 dollar BLT and it had three small pieces of bacon, two white end slices of tomato, and one thin leaf of lettuce on hard toasted bread so small it looked like an oversized finger sandwich. And not only is this terrible sandwich overpriced, it comes with no sides; no chips, no pickle, no fries...nothing and is so small it's served on a SAUCER. Paid $24  plus tip for a BLT, a turkey club, a coffee, a Pepsi and a side of fries. Come here for the breakfast but run away fast and far when the lunch hour hits..."}
{"text":"oh yeah. great pancakes. of course, i like the ones that are like dessert -filled with strawberries, brown sugar, whipped AND sour cream! but i didn't like the omelet last time. watery with veggies, american cheese. and the toast was slathered in margarine. is butter that much more expensive? but it's not like i won't go back ;) plus, we took my brother (visiting from SF) and he thought it was very decent grub, especially the home fries."}
{"text":"This is a really good breakfast place that has a nice variety of dishes for relatively cheap prices. They are known for their hotcakes which are like a cross between crepes and pancakes, which my friend ordered and were really tasty with fresh strawberries.  I ordered an omelet which was also quite good.  Decor is that of a typical diner.  Service was good.  We somehow ended up seated by a bunch of loud kids who sat at tables on either side of us, which kind of ruined the ambiance (they sat down after we selected our table), but that was not the fault of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The service sucks, the place is dirty and cramped and there's usually a line out the door .  But the hotcakes are unique and wonderful; a food always worth the calories and unavailable anyplace else."}
{"text":"I went here because Queen Obama did. I do everything that she does. I did NOT go here for the delicious specialty hotcakes, fluffy eggs, and Lyonn! No, sir! The amazing breakfast had nothing to do with it.

Cash only."}
{"text":"The service sucks and they only take cash, but their pancakes are pure ambrosia.  I've never done cocaine, but I bet it feels like how Pamela's pancakes taste.  Their homefries are excellent too.  They make great toast.  The rest of their stuff (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.) is good, but nothing especially fantastic.

Get the pancakes; you will not regret it.  I have flown from California back to Pittsburgh just to eat them."}
{"text":"4.5 stars - minus .5 star for the east coast style service that might not be warm enough for the occasional west coast tourist.

Otherwise, I have not found corned beef hash or hotcakes as good as what Pamela's serves here.

The strawberry hotcakes are filled with strawberries, brown sugar, and cream, and the crispy hotcake with an occasional brown sugar crunch is always more than satisfying. Then there's the corned beef hash that I dream of whenever I taste other kinds of hashes elsewhere. It looks simple and homely, but somehow it tastes heavenly.

I always come here whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I find it inconceivable that anyone could give this eatery anything less than a 5-star review. It's a phenomenal place to eat eggs and potatoes and drink coffee. It's all I want in a restaurant."}
{"text":"For some reason this is \"the\" breakfast spot for Pitt but other than it's the closest one to campus I don't think this place is anything special. All the food I could cook myself (and I'm no chef). The wait is always an hour or so if it's a weekend and they only take cash... In my opinion there are plenty of other much better breakfast places on Craig St or in shadyside/Lawrenceville if you're willing to travel a bit."}
{"text":"Really decent standard diner fare, which is no great shakes, but one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh for breakfast.  The pancakes are more like crepes, which won points with me, and my pal had what looked like a proper lumberjack meaty meal.  Real kudos go to the great 1930's - 1960's photos covering every wall surface.  Random and wonderful."}
{"text":"You will definitely not go away hungry after breakfast at Pamela's. The servings are huge and the prices are moderate (though it is cash only). Had the breakfast special which came with two eggs, choice of meat, and two of their famous crepe pancakes - couldn't finish it all! As to the pancakes, they are thin, crispy around the edges, and the size of a dinner plate. I wished I had ordered the strawberry stuffed pancakes after I saw them at the table next to me. Oh well, there's always next time!

{"text":"I went here for brunch on a Sunday morning. I was amazed at how quickly they could run people through this joint--yet I know I at least didn't feel even vaguely rushed. The line for seating moved quickly, we waited less than 20 minutes with several parties ahead of us.

We had a party of six so I expected that we wouldn't all be able to sit together, so we broke up into two parties, but the wait staff had remembered we split up so when two tables next to each other freed up they made sure we could move to those tables to stick together. I really appreciated that! The service really was top notch, I was really impressed!

I had a bacon and cheese omelet. It was pretty good, though I wasn't too impressed with the cheese in the omelet. However, I thought the quality of the potatoes more than made up for that! I could've eaten nothing but those breakfast potatoes and been a very, very happy girl!

The bathroom situation was a bit of a put-off, too. You had to go down a very narrow, very sketchy looking set of stairs and the bathroom just didn't seem clean to me at all. I'd suggest avoiding it if at all possible.

And remember, Pamela's is CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"This Squirrel Hill location is now closed. But don't worry, Pamela's is still in the neighborhood, just around the corner. Same food (in other words, same delicious strawberry hotcakes), same service.

For the new location's Yelp page go here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/pamelas-upstreet-pittsburgh#hrid:ALHFycq2Qx3_9E3Mw2MSnQ/

My major issue with this old Forbes Ave location was how the tables were so tightly crowded together. Even though I'm not a big-hipped girl, I was always worried I'd knock someone's eggs or hash off their table as I passed. Happily, this is less of a danger at the more spacious new location."}
{"text":"best pancakes in Pittsburgh! awesome decor."}
{"text":"Pamela's in Pittsburgh, every location, seems to have great food. I only give this location a 4 star review because they rarely come back after giving you the drinks- and the omelettes seem to have whole sausage patties put into them without being cut. Other than that.. every piece of food is the same, and the chaotic scene on the weekends is the same. The staff seem nice too!"}
{"text":"I actually ate at Pamela's P&G in Millvale not once, but twice, this weekend. Based on my Saturday morning experience I would have given this place 5-stars. The food was literally so good I returned for a second day. It was not my first time at this particular location and I've also been to the Pamela's in the Strip District. I know what to expect from the food... absolute perfection. I always order the Tex Mex Omelet with Wheat Toast and the Lyonnaise Potatoes. I've never been disappointed by the food.

Sunday, the line was a little longer. They weave you between the aisles in the Lincoln Pharmacy while you wait. There's plenty to look at while you linger in line. Lots of Pittsburgh trinkets and novelty items to browse through which is somewhat entertaining. But, for some reason the wait was extra-long on Sunday. You could see that tables weren't being cleaned off as quickly as usual. Plus, our group was half-way finished with our food by the time my brother even received his meal... I think we caught them on an off day.

Place feels historic, but is clean and has a different atmosphere from the tourist traps in the Strip District. The food is always excellent!! I highly recommend eating here, if you have the time to spare and patience to wait."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have always had a good experience with the wait staff and considered the food to be passable.  Before last week, I would have probably actually given this place a nice 4 star rating.  HOWEVER, I work in the area and drive past the diner on a daily basis at about 6:30-6:45 in the morning and what I saw the other day has turned me off of this restaurant forever.  As I was on my way to work, I was stopped at a light in front of the closed diner and saw a man prepping the food for the morning rush and he was SMOKING while working with the food.  I am not squeamish when it comes to smoking for the most part, but this is not 1960 anymore and there are health department regulations.  The more I think about it, the more utterly disgusting it is to think of the potential cigarette ashes in my food.  After seeing that, I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"Pancakes always great but the Greek omelette was nearly inedible. #1 - it is never acceptable to serve a brown omelette, that almost certainly guarantees that it is over cooked.  #2 when the omelette is paper thin, browning it guarantees it is severely over cooked and by adding the olives, spinach, onions and feta inside instead of incorporating them, it ruins the entire omelette.  Potatoes had no seasoning at all.  A little salt and pepper could have gone a long way.  Service is always great."}
{"text":"Came here once when I first moved to Pitt. Luckily we didn't have to wait to long to be seated. I ordered the strawberry pancakes and my boyfriend the banana. We also added on the lyonnaise potatoes. Both our pancakes were delicious, maybe a tiny bit too sweet for breakfast. But hey, I ordered it! The potatoes were good just a little too salty/greasy. This place is definitely fun for a once a year treat!"}
{"text":"Mmm, Pamela's! (picture me saying this with the Borat accent!)

Their pancakes--SO GOOD.
The wait to get in sometimes--SO BAD!

That's literally the long and short of it. I pine for their deliciously thin, crispy, and yet soft and chewy crepe-like pancakes with the brown sugar, sour cream, strawberries and syrup! MMmmmmm! Great (and caloric) way to start your day! It just kinda sucks when it's 20 degrees outside and you're half in the door, half out because they don't really have a \"lobby\" or a ton of seating. Gets borderline claustrophobic crowded in there sometimes so I couldn't really give it a 5/5 stars. The Walnut St. location suffers from the same problem too. =("}
{"text":"This  is a an old soda fountain / pharmacy, and they also serve breakfast, lunch dinner.   They serve the famous Pamela's Hotcakes which are my favorite.  Inside there is the original woodwork, which looks nice, and on the pharmacy side theres a large section that sells Steeler, Pirates and Penquin stuff and theres some penny candy for the kids!  The waitresses were very friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Was a little intimidated by the line of people waiting outside but it went really quickly.  Just make sure the entire party is there and it's almost immediate.

The decor... hella gay!  Seriously, with the rainbow discoball and paintings of cher, diana ross, and the village people I now know why people say squirrel hill is a gay area.  

Anyway it's fun, family friendly, filling, and GREAT value for your money."}
{"text":"My very favorite breakfast restaurant in Pittsburgh! I love the pancakes and sausage! Omlettes, Benedicts, Waffles and traditional farm fresh eggs also five star! Worth the wait - P&G Diner shares space with Lincoln Pharmacy with a modest penny candy counter, operational pharmacy and gift items."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I live in Chicago and try to eat a short stack and home fries every chance I get when I'm here visiting my husband's family. There are lines during peak hours and they only accept cash - but it is about the food. Even the Obama's love it!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that we did NOT come here because Queen Obama did. That said, we did come because we were looking for a local diner for breakfast and wanted something good and home cooked. 

I was pretty surprised that the Millvale location was as hoppin' as it was! There isn't much going on in Millvale and was almost hesitant to visit this location. I saw the beaming reviews on Yelp! and being close to home sealed the deal. 

We waited in line for about 15 minutes - it was quite busy the Sunday before Labor Day. The service was pretty slow - which was compounded by the fact that our server was new there. 

I had the banana and chocolate chip hotcakes - OMG! They were to die for. The hotcakes are a cross between pancakes and crepes, in my opinion, and are thinner but have delicious crispy edges. The bananas and chocolate chips were rolled up in the hotcakes like crepes rather than piled on top a stack of pancakes. The chocolate was perfectly melted and not too sweet. 

I also ordered the sausage - served in links and with a nice, crispy casing almost like handmade sausage. 

...and a chocolate malt...for breakfast! 

The prices are really reasonable and me and my husband ate for less than $20."}
{"text":"The cutest diner in Pittsburgh! Plenty of street parking close to the diner as well. The staff is always so friendly! We normally have kayla as our server and she is so fun and great at her job. The cooks do a great job as well! They are always packed on the weekends but I've never had to wait long for my food. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"There are not too many options for a (good) breakfast in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh to feed the hungry college students and their visiting friends and families.  Aside from the usual Starbucks, Mickey D's, and that bagel place that begins with a \"B\" (Bruebakers?), the pickins are slim.  And then, there's Pamelas.......

There's a reason why they line up early on weekend mornings.......it's good, really good!  Those thin, crepe-like pancakes are among the best ever, especially if you get them topped or stuffed with fruit, cream cheese or whatever they have.  They're like eating dessert for breakfast.  Their omlets are also pretty awesome -- the TexMex is my new fave with the chorizo, salso, guac, sour cream, etc.  

Service is slow, and not especially friendly - this isn't the place to go if you want to feel all warm and fuzzy and have the waitress call you \"Hon.\"  Also, the coffee here is pretty lame - stick with the juices and get your coffee from the other offerings up and down Forbes Avenue, but for heaven's sake - leave your appetitie to Pamelas!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Who doesn't love it? The crepe pancakes are outstanding. The home fries, soft and buttery. The Oakland location was somewhat recently remodeled to be bright and inviting. The Strip location has a couple unique and well regarded items such as the Tex Mex Omelette and pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing hotcakes/pancakes.

The line moves quickly for such a small place.

The homefries are also great.

I will miss this place - I wish they had a location in California."}
{"text":"Nice towny diner atmosphere but the food left a lot to be desired. I get that this is a local institution but today anyway they may have been resting on their laurels. 

Corned beef hash that is 90% home fried potatoes technically shouldn't be called corned beef hash ... Plus the bit of meat that was present seemed to be processed from a can stuff. Ick. Ruined my positive St. Paddy's vibe.

Eggs over medium came out way over cooked as well. Getting your eggs the right way should be an absolute given at a country diner.

Bush league stuff at Pamela's. If you know anything about food I suggest giving this joint a wide berth. Fact."}
{"text":"Great place for a family breakfast. Food here is okay and what you'd expect if you went to an IHOP or Bob Evans restaurant. Food here is reasonably priced and the service is pretty quick. I think they have take out but the eating here is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"---UPDATE---
After posting my original 2 star review regarding a poor experience and deceptive billing practices, I was contacted by the owner.  She offered to refund my meal if I emailed her my details to her @aol.com email address.  I did as requested on 3/28/18.  I never received a response from Pam and even reached out to her here on Yelp.  I have found that restaurant managers/owners will respond on Yelp so that everyone can see that they care...only to never live up to their promises of rectifying an issue that occurred at their establishment.  Unfortunately Pamela's is one of those businesses.  I have now updated my review to 1 star and will never eat at Pamela's when I visit the burgh.

---ORIGINAL REVIEW---
I have given this diner 4 star reviews in the past.  This time however I was very disappointed.  We had 3 in our party.  They ordered 2 eggs over easy, ham, lyonnaise potatoes, iced tea white toast...and 2 pancakes, potatoes, sausage, and I think possibly 2 eggs with iced tea again.  I ordered 2 eggs over easy, potatoes, wheat toast, and sausage, coffee and water.

Their orders came out yet mine was nowhere to be found.  They both said that their orders were good as usual.  6 minutes later my plate found its way to our table by someone other than our waiter.  The over easy eggs were barely cooked.  When I cut into the whites, an obscene amount of clear egg white rolled all over my plate.  Not a little bit, I estimate 1/8 of a cup or two tablespoons.  Mind you, this was not milky white almost cooked egg whites...it was raw liquid that poured to the edge of the plate.  Our waiter was nowhere around nor did he come back to check on my plate after it sauntered out about the time the rest of our party was 75% finished.

I called the lady I thought was in charge to the table.  She looked at the eggs and offered to get new ones.  I declined since my party was almost finished.  I asked that they be removed but I would pay for the potatoes, toast and sausage.  I am pretty sure she crossed out the 7.95 order that I initially had and added a 5.95 and 2.95.  WHAT?!  So take the eggs out and I was charge a la carte for potatoes, toast and sausage and I get charged more because my eggs were raw?  The total bill after tax was $27.90.  That's obscene.

If management reads this I would love to know why they think this is acceptable.  If my math is wrong please let me know and I will update this review.  Until then, I am supremely disappointed and mildly pissed."}
