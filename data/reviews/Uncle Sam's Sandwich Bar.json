{"text":"Ok for a Philly girl in Pittsburg, the cheesesteak was not bad.  I would say the bread could be better.  Please tell every city outside of Philly that we do not eat lettuce, tomato and mayo on a steak.  This would be called a cheesesteak hoagie in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"They think they do you a favor serving you. I waited already for 25 min and only got my damn sandwich."}
{"text":"I tried two grilled sandwiches--both bland, very little seasoning. The sweet potato fries were good. Service was friendly. Might give it another try for the cold cut sandwiches"}
{"text":"Decent food had a side salad an turkey and provolone.   The atmosphere is clean and inviting , however customer service is terrible and employees are not friendly. ."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots around town.  They have a friendly staff and good choices for beer as well.  You cant go wrong with the Italian Sausage or the hot turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for an uncomplicated sub or cheese steak, made in front of your eyes by cheerful people for cheap. Sit at the bar to watch the cooks at work, and enjoy a root beer float while you're at it! This is obviously not an upscale establishment, but it is fantastic at what it intends to do."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before today. A group of us at work ordered hoagies today. I got the buffalo chicken hoagie and it waa delicious.  They don't use breaded chicken, which is hard to find in a buffalo chicken hoagie.  They use really good rolls for their hoagies, they don't fall apart!  If you place a large order I recommend checking to make sure they packed everything before leaving. They did leave out some of our order. They were probably just super busy--I'd still order from here again."}
{"text":"Went to Uncle Sam's and had the Steak, egg and cheese sandwich.  delicious in ever regard, the string french fries  are amazing!  Great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I visited with a friend from out of town.  We drove by this place a few times and thought it sounded like a cool and tasty place to chow down in.  Entering the Bar we liked what we saw on the menu and ordered with delight.  I ordered an Italian Sausage Works  and my friend a Cheese Steak.  The ingredients looked and were very fresh, but the sandwiches had absolutely NO taste at all.  They were boring and we both couldn't believe just how bad they actually were. Even the root beer float was lame.  Soft mushy ice cream in a great root beer.  For the next few days, every time we passed this place we scoffed at the waste of time and money we spent there.  Save yourself the money and buy a hot air balloon, suck on it...chew the air and you will get the same flavor....but at least you will get a humorous sound when you say \"Yucky!\"."}
{"text":"OMG the best philly cheese steaks in Pittsburgh! We eat here at least 3 times a week when we are in town. Steak is juicy. Mayonnaise is the best I've had EVER! Cheese is yum yum yum. The young man that usually makes our sandwiches is the best! He fills that sucker up with so much filling. Simply addictive! Now I wanna go get another one LOL!"}
{"text":"I just threw away $9:( I ordered a sandwich off of the Vegetarian menu. After they served it to me, I watched them cook the rest of the orders on the same grill same area with meat and veggies together. They have two large grills big enough to make separate areas for meat and veggies. I thought this was standard practice in the restaurant business. And then I watched her clean it leaving bacon crumbs behind on the grill. I wanted to say something but I was scared because the girls in there were kind of rude. If you want to cook that way it's fine, but don't say \"vegetarian\" on the menu."}
{"text":"Huge portions and pretty tasty! My turkey and provolone sandwich unexpectedly came with fries too - can't complain about that! Diner-like atmosphere with sit down tables, high top tables and a bar/counter area.  Downsides: I came during lunch time and it was really busy with them preparing big takeout orders so I ended up waiting 15-20 minutes for my sandwich to come out. I'd imagine if I had come at a different time it would have been a little less crazy. Also tables and seats looked like they needed to be cleaned."}
{"text":"Been waiting 6 long years to get a hold OK the steak, egg, and prov. This place never skipped a beat! Great bread awesome service! Love these hoagies. Didn't know what to expect out in Robinson but they def have the consistency across the 4 properties I've been to.  Thank you uncle Sam, filled me up once again!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich place. They have all the classic styles. They have an uncle Sam cheesesteaks which is the steak and onions but with peppers and mushrooms as well.   Was very good and the place was packed. They turned them out very fast and the seats turned over nicely at the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great and was super impressed by my cheesesteak.  Located in a strip mall, it's a busy place especially around lunch time during the week.  It has the old school diner type of vibe when you walk in and they even have the counter where you can eat.  It's a seat yourself type of place and it can be difficult to find a table during the week.  You order at the counter and then seat yourself.  It's not a waiter/waitress type of place.  When your order is ready, they walk around and just yell out your number so you have to listen up.    I can't remember the exact name of the sandwich I ordered but it was one of their specialties and it was basically a regular cheesesteak.  They asked me if I wanted to add lettuce, tomato, onions and mayo to my sandwich.  Yes, yes, yes and yes.  They have fountain soda for your beverage.  When we sat down (yes, we were able to get a table), I was a little disappointed because we didn't order any french fries.  Much to my surprise, every sandwich is served with a ton of french fries (included and they were great).  I was impressed by that.  The cheesesteak was near excellent.  It was huge and there was a ton of meat.  It's definitely one of the better cheesesteaks I've had.  I threw some ketchup on it and it was complete.  If I lived in the area, I would definitely come here from time to time.  The portions are huge so it's not exactly the kind of place you can come to very often.    The only knock I have against this place is that the food took a while to get served.  I understand they are busy but you have to do a quick job during the week for lunch.  You need to get people in and out.  Each sandwich was about $9 which is completely reasonable considering they all came with a ton of fries.  It's definitely a solid spot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have stopped here a couple times when we are grabbing something quicker to eat. Recently we just went and I had their special - buffalo chicken sandwich. So good! I love their fries too. They have the perfect amount of salt. I would say they are bigger portions (I took half of my sandwich home) but if you are hungry, the whole sandwich will fill you up! The atmosphere is cool too, with all of the funny signs and memorabilia they have on the walls."}
{"text":"Good Sandwich shoppe. I had the Cap and Prov with onion, lettuce and mayo hot. Came with fries and ordered a large fountain soda and was just under $10. Very filling. Going to try a cheese steak next time. Very laid back, diner like atmosphere with the lunch counter vibe."}
{"text":"Decent place for a sandwich, kind of like an old school luncheonette. I ordered the classic cheesesteak sandwich which was tasty, and it came with a pile of fries which were delicious if not a little much for lunch if you're watching your weight (which sometimes I am and most times I'm not)."}
{"text":"Whoa, wait.... BEST mushroom cheesesteak I've ever had. Lots of meat and mushrooms, stringy melted provolone and a soft chewy roll. Add a huge side of yummy fries, enough for two or three and your stuffed.   Service was prompt and friendly.  Best thing it's not more than a football field away from Springhill Suites where I'm staying."}
{"text":"This is a good lunch place -- sandwiches and more sandwiches. A broad menu with something for everyone -- from meat lovers to vegetarian options. I had Ultra Philly Cheese Steak and did not regret it. Plenty of food; you will not leave hungry. I would return."}
{"text":"Passed this place a lot and never went in.  For dinner I decided to stop by right after work to see if subs were good.  Got my self the Ultra Uncle Sams Special at the bar to go.  I didn't think I was waiting long at all and not really sure how this all happened.  As the server handed me my to go order of the sub with the side of fries, I asked her how much.  She looked at the guy working the flat top he smiled and just put his fist up.  The girl smiled and handed it to as if it was just free.  What?!?!?! I was so confused.  I tried to pay and they said it was a good day.  The guy gave me a \"pound\" and I was on my way.  The New Yorker in me just could not believe that an experience like that just happened......  I just couldn't believe that just happened.  Someone out of the blue just decided that dinner was on them....    I got home and tasted the fries.. AWESOME.  Kind of like shoe string fries, skinny and perfectly salted.  The SUB WAS REALLY REALLY GREAT!  I am still reeling about this whole experience.  I don't know if they knew what they were doing, but they just made a fan out of me.  Such a small gesture (less than $10 worth) just gained them a lifetime of business.  Not just a fan of Uncle Sam's but that particular location.  Happy people making other people happy.  I will tell everyone I know about this place."}
{"text":"A nice little sandwich shop in an old decade theme. Everything is delicious and quick after you order. Be careful though, the fries are free if you dine in but if you get an order to go then you gotta add them to the order. Still though, if you are looking for a delicious sub this is a place to stop by."}
{"text":"If I'm in Pittsburg I make sure I stop here! Great subs! If you like a great Philly Steak sub and like a lot of it you've got to try this strip-mall treasure. Be sure to order their sweet potato fries! You may want to bring a friend to help you finish!"}
{"text":"I went to Uncle Sam's for the first time today. Even though the food was good I was very disappointed with how the employees were acting.  I don't know what the names of the employees who worked in between 2-4pm are but their attitudes were abysmal. The one woman was very condescending when she was taking my order. The other woman was rude in general. I wanted my sandwich wrapped and instead of handing it to me when she was done, she dropped it on the counter and said \"here you go\" in the worst tone possible. I noticed that the cook wasn't doing much, but I did notice that he was texting and not wearing gloves while cooking. So all in all, I will not be going back there again. There are many other sandwich shops out there so I won't miss anything. Especially when I can get better customer service at places like Subway."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We have drove by it so many times and I'm so happy we stopped. Thank you for the delicious food"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, but horrible service. Food used to be better. Something has changed.  Cashier/food runner rude and impolite to guests.  Place is always dirty. Dirty tables, dirty floors, dirty bathrooms. Why hasn't the allegheny county health department insisted these people wear hats when they are handling my food. Watched one girl run her hand through her hair, then continue to work on someone's order. Gross!  Tried to contact ownership (twice). Each time my email was ignored."}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here my belly is stuffed and my taste buds are jumping for joy hoping the next time comes quick. I always get the Sams special and to me it's out of this world and very few sandwich shops beat it if any. You get a nice helping of Frys no matter what and I seldom eat them all after that monster sandwich. Order a Coke and drink away at the free refill machine. If you so desire you can also get a beer with your meal."}
{"text":"I love me a legit sandwich shop. This one seems to specialize in the warm versions, not the cold cuts. Each order is handmade and can therfore take a little while to make. I waited over five minutes for mine, which was to go, so felt like a lifetime. Definitely calling ahead next time! I got the portobello mushroom sandwich - I don't know if I could ever have anything different, save for the spicy mustard I added to it back at the office. Worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"On our way back from the Pittsburgh Airport we were looking for something quick and affordable. After taking a look at Yelp we found Uncle Sam's Sandwich bar. Wow what a find! Great sandwiches at a great price. We had the Pizza Steak sandwich as well as the Italian and both were great. If you eat in at Uncle Sams French Fries come for free with your sandwich. Overall I would hit this up again when traveling or in the area."}
{"text":"I have often wondered what this place would be like as I walked in the other stores around the area and smell the delicious smell of cooking cheese steak and onions.    The food is pretty par and the menu is very short. We got to 2 cheesesteaks and a side of fries. The cheesesteaks were OK and kind of small for the price. The fries were big enough for both of us to share.  The staff was OK. They seem to be more interested in conversing amongst themselves than dealing with any customers.  I would go back to this place if I was driving by but would not go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Pitt alum can find a familiar sandwich out by the airport while visiting such greats as Sam's club and Men's wearhouse. The counter service here is always prompt and friendly. The sandwiches are very good considering that they use frozen steak for the cheese steak, but then again they've got beer so that's cool...but unfortunately so was the bread on my sandwich. I'm not overly impressed, but nostalgic and will return because the bread is usually just fine."}
{"text":"Went to this area couple time and always attracted by the delicious smell. We drove by yesterday and wasn't sure what to eat so we decide to have this place a try. We got the ultra sam's special, ultra philly cheese steak  and sweet potato fries. They were fast so we were able to in and out within 15 minutes I would say. The fries were very crispy and comes with a large amount and for only $3! That is the deal! Both cheese steak were very good and we both liked it. I would say this place is a spot that when you don't know what to eat for a quick bit around the area. Who doesn't like cheese steak right?"}
{"text":"First time here and cheesesteaks are their specialty. The quality and quantity won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. The restaurant was extremely dirty at 3:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday. Floor was filthy, none of the tables were wiped down. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place for hoagies, and the fries are really good too. My group was there during peak lunch hours and only waited 8 minutes for our food. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pepper cheese steak was excellent!  The fries it came with were lukewarm at best and stale, as if they had been sitting out since early that morning.  I suppose it serves me right though, all the other reviews recommend the sweet potato fries and I just got the regular kind.  I'd give this place a higher rating, but the stale fries combined with the attitude of the staff kind of put a damper on my spirits.  The cashier who took my order was very short with the gentleman who ordered in front of me, and then again with myself, and then AGAIN when I went back to ask for a to-go container.  I think she just couldn't wait to get back to chatting with her co-worker.  She just flat out ignored one gentleman who asked where the soda machine was.  After all is said and done, the sandwich was good enough that I think I'll be back.  Hopefully the fries and cashier were a singular occurrence."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious every time. Never had an issue. Great place! The fries are good and come with the hoagies if you dine-in. The prices are reasonable and the people are nice."}
{"text":"Every time I take a trip to Ikea I stop at Uncle Sam's for a cheesesteak. The cheese steak is pretty good, but I have never understood why anyone would order lettuce, tomato, and mayo on the sand which as suggested on the board."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak around!  Fries are good as well.  And, they serve  beer.  They get extremely busy during lunch M-F so you may want to come early."}
{"text":"ultra uncle delux split with wife tons of fryes,never leave hungry"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. The sandwiches here are really great, especially the cheesesteaks. The food can be a little greasy although when it tastes this good that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.  Also if you get the chance, sit at the bar because it's very cool to watch the cooks in action."}
{"text":"Ive been to other locations and this one is by far the best and friendliest!! The food is always good. I never feel like they were stingy with the meat on my hoagie like another location :-(. The fries are the best too!"}
{"text":"This place has great potential but there are some failings unfortunately.  I usually go here on Sundays when I arrive in town.    The past couple of times I have visited, their Credit Card Machine was down and they were out of some flavors of soda which points to a concern on management.  The folks that work there are pretty friendly - only one time did I not have a good service experience where the gentleman (probably understandably so) thought I was causing too much interruption to the Steelers game.  This place has a variety of grilled subs.   The sandwiches i had were large and okay.  I think this place could be much better.  atmosphere - vaires - usually pretty quiet  food - it was good - a little better than a Subway (has better offerings).    Price - Sandwich $5-9 - depending on the size  Overall - Give it a try"}
{"text":"Very good cheese steak and not that icky goop cheese sauce. Real cheese and good bread and meat along with decent fries - the good fries really surprised me, since they don't seem to be important to most sandwich places. The sandwiches are HUGE (two meals for me) and very good."}
{"text":"I've been to a few uncle sam's locations. I always have a great sandwich from here.   We were shopping in robinson searching somewhere to eat when i yelp searched a place to grab dinner. I had no idea a location was out in robinson so we checked it out.   The store is clean and bright.. very modern (compared to oakland location) Staff was very helpful. They had bottled Boylan Soda (root beer, cream soda) . Also they had beer and fountain drinks. Free fries comes with your sandwich for dining in. Also, they take cards unlike the waterworks location! :)  I ordered the Ultra Mushroom Cheesesteak which had mushrooms, grilled onions, cheese, lettuce, tomato & mayo. Bobby ordered the same thing. The sub was delicious and so filling. We each only ate half.   Again, ive never had a bad cheesesteak from uncle sams. Love it!"}
{"text":"Good sub, but the sweet potato fries were amazing. Good pricing also.  Love the comment on the order board for their coffee. \"good coffee, go next door\" , it's a Starbucks"}
{"text":"I am currently sitting in my boxer briefs in a hotel room bed sipping a victory Dirt Wolf. None of this would be possible without Uncle Sam.   This place deserves more than the measly five stars I have bestowed upon it. They are not just a restaurant; they are a sanctuary, an escape, proof that good people will always triumph in this world. Oh, and their food is dope.   I'm on my final leg of our trip across the county. After a tire blow out halfway between Chicago and Philadelphia (our final destination) we got waylaid and had to make an unexpected pit stop in Pittsburgh. Little did I know our misfortune was just lady fortune masquerading as disaster.   After a long drive and hours standing in the rain, we were desperate for a hoagie near our hotel. Well, yelp came through big time and recommended this place right across the street from our hotel.   I expected nothing, but got everything.   We ordered a hot Italian sub and a couple beers (who knew they'd carry some tasty local beers at crazy cheap price). Cashier was super friendly and our total was like 14 dollars. That would barely get me one bottle of beer in the Bay Area, let alone our whole meal with 2 beers.   Food was great, staff seemed to be having a good time, and there were some cops chowing down in the corner (which means this must be a good local spot and that this was the safest meal I would have that week).  The icing on the cake was our parting gift. Out of the kindness of his heart, because he saw our overloaded SUV and respected the adventure we too, the friendly (I'm assuming manager? Owner? Original Uncle Sam? Flava Flav-ish hype dude?) manager went out of his way to grab us two bottles of the beers we bought and stuck them in a brown bag as a parting gift for us.   I mean, who does that anymore? After a long day on the road with car trouble after a long week of adventure; we got our cake iced.   Thank you kind sir. Thank you Uncle Sam's. Your kindness has warmed my heart and soul.   Mahalo for your Kakuah!"}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here! And get the chili cheese fries....HOLY CRAP. Amazing! One order is enough to feed 2 and honestly I could've forgone the sandwich and just ate an entire bucket of these. I ordered around 8pm and got one of the last orders (they mentioned they were about to run out while I was waiting for my food) so I'm assuming the chili is made fresh daily and served til it's gone. I've also ordered takeout from here with a group order and the employees were super patient and nice while I had to track down some of my coworkers to ask if they wanted lett, tom, and mayo. The value here is great too!   FYI- you DO get free fries if you eat in. I personally think the inside is pretty dark and dreary, but they have some cute signs to look at while you wait."}
{"text":"I've been here once before with coworkers for lunch. Their cheesesteaks are really good and I love that you get free fries with your sandwich when you eat in.   This visit I got the skinny steak. Basically a cheesesteak without the cheese. I don't even know why I bothered. There's a reason there's cheese on a cheesesteak. It wasn't terrible though. The last time I was here I got the mushroom steak and it was so good!   It does get packed during lunch time during the week though. They do have other sandwich options on the menu and also some vegetarian sandwiches."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are alright but the fact that if you order take out you don't get fries but if you eat in you do, is crazy.  Fries extra cause you take it out??? Stupid"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Okay, I am no connoisseur of sandwiches but I do know that this place has got it goin' on.  I'm new to the area and have been here 3 times. My first time I ordered the chicken cheese stake sandwich. It was great. If you eat in, you get free fries.  My 2nd and 3rd time I got the Philly cheese steak. IT WAS AMAZING. I went Philly style (which they didn't appreciate) so I axed the provolone and got cheese sauce on the side. It ended up being pretty brilliant to get the cheese on the side because their sandwiches are large and in charge, so leftovers are welcomed. I must admit, the leftovers were just as tasty as they were fresh (if reheated properly - toaster oven and wrapped in foil).   Anyways, their sandwiches are nothing short of amazing and the fries are just as great.   They do tend to get packed during lunch time and space is limited. Also, everything is made to order so expect a small wait, a wait worth while."}
{"text":"AMAZING veggie sub served with a ton of thin fries. It's a ton of food and I always end up taking some home. Kind of hidden with all the chains in the area but really nice to eat somewhere that isn't the same old chain. Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Awesome place, the ultimate mushroom cheese steak is the bomb! Softest bread I've ever had with lots of juice steak and provolone!"}
{"text":"Used to come here a long time ago.. Tried it again last weekend. Excellent steak hoagies! And the thin fries were well done as requested! Then the test. Came here one week later. Ordered the same. Just as excellent! Consistency!  Recommend to everyone in the Robinson area that who do not want chain fast food, and don't have time to wait over 2 hours everywhere else around here.  PS  even draft beer ! Nice!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I last had a sub from Uncle Sam's so I decided to stop in and see if it was as good as I remember. Sure enough it was as good as I remembered!   The place itself is just a cute little old fashioned sub place. The staff has always been friendly every time I've been there. There nothing really special about it so you definitely need to enjoy subs if you want to eat here. My only complaint is that it's not a little closer to me so I can enjoy it more often. All in all, I would definitely recommend stopping in for a quick, delicious lunch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Ate here for the first time this afternoon, and ordered the Ultra Philly Cheese Steak! Bun was soft, chewy and fresh.  The grilled onions just melt in your mouth! While the description says that it's \"loaded with extra steak\", I'm a huge meat eater, so I will be ordering EXTRA meat to make it even better. I could eat here every day!!!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Uncle Sam's. My love started way back at my Pittstart.  I have had almost every sandwich on the menu, but constant standby is a delicious cold turkey. The bread is yummy and if you eat at the restaurant then you get a free side of fries. Now I consider myself a fry expert and I have a great appreciation when my fries are fresh. They make every order right when you pick up or right before they bring you your sandwich. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. One of the best sandwiches in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"OMG, this is the best sandwich shop I've ever come across!  Very crowded & busy lunch crowd.  Tight squeeze at the tables, but you won't even notice because the food is sooo good!  The sub rolls are heavenly, slightly crusty outside & soft and chewy inside.  All subs come with fries, which are shoestring style, crispy, hot, & fresh!  Go to Uncle Sam's!"}
{"text":"The signature item on the menu is the cheese steak. We ordered 3 of the to take out.  They were ready quickly but that's the end of the good in this review. The steak was tough and extremely fatty. The grilled onions were raw. And the bun was soggy from the grease.  They were not busy, so I should have guessed that they were not well liked.    STAY AWAY FROM UNCLE SAM'S."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's is a total throwback to a good old fashioned sub shop.  There are hot subs, cold subs, veggie subs, a little something for everyone.  Last time I went, I got a cold salami and cheese sub and my boyfriend got a mushroom cheesesteak.  We both agreed that the bread was super fresh and the ingredients were all delicious.  We ate at the restaurant, so our fries and cheese sauce were included with our meal.  If you get a meal to go, you do have to pay extra for a side of fries.  I wasn't able to finish my sub, so the employees were super nice and wrapped it all up for me to take home.  If you're in the mood for a sub, upgrade from the chains and go to Uncle Sam's!"}
{"text":"This little place is tucked in between a Starbucks and another little shop in Robinson in the Shoping area that includes Target, Walmart, Latitude 40, etc. it was a fFriday night during Lent. I had just picked my husband up from the airport and we wanted to go someplace and not wait in line. Crazy huh???  We decided to give this place a try and I'm glad we did.  I ordered an Ultimate Cheesesteak and my husband ordered an Italian. It seriously one of the best cheesesteaks I've ever had. The bread was fresh and had been warmed on the grill. The steak was very flavorful. I ended up taking half home because it came with a mountain of fries. I took some of those home as well. Their fries are thinner like McDonald's fries. They make them when ordered so they are hot and crispy. They also have fresh brewed iced tea which I love. My hubby got a beer with his sandwich. They have a decent beer selection and some 6 packs to go.  I'm very surprised that they didn't have a long line waiting but they do a lot of take out. The employees are super nice and the restaurant is incredibly clean."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had in the area. I've tried three different places in the last two weeks and Uncle Sam's has the most flavor hands down and at a decent price to boot. I don't eat there that often but over the years I've tried different versions of their cheesesteak and all of them have a consistent good taste."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5th star if 1) they offers subs on a wheat bun, and 2) they cut the sodium by 90%.... Okay, in a seriousness, these sandwiches are super tasty. Chicken cheesesteak with crispy bacon, a fried fresh egg, grilled onions and mushrooms, add lettuce, tomato and mayo...oh my! I think I'm going to get in the car and get a speeding ticket on my way over there RIGHT NOW! Pure delight. Healthy? Who cares?! Well, okay, you can't do this all the time. You shouldn't, but do it once and it's gonna be hard not to do it again. *Bonus*. Free shoestring fries with all sandwiches!!! God Bless America!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who really liked this place but sadly I was stuffed from eatting before hand. On entering we weren't greeted and the place was pretty slow. You walk up to the counter for placing your order they give you a slip and call your order and bring it to the table. I will admit something's looked pretty good and I seen they had sweet potato fries so I had to try some cause I love them. I got a big basket with cheese and bbq. The fries portion was huge for $4 I was stoked but I was hoping for something with more flavor I guess. The cheese is what I would call fake baseball game cheese I think it's good but some people seem to hate it. The bbq tasted like sweet baby rays so that was good and they did have season all out for people so I grabbed some of that for the fries. The service was fast and the food was good I'll definitely be returning to try the buffalo chicken sandwich next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great subs and friendly service. The only issue is their soda fountain. It's always overly syrupy and slightly flat. I've tried it on 3 separate occasions with no improvement."}
{"text":"My go-to lunch spot every time I'm in Robinson!!!! The staff is always super friendly and look like they're actually having a good time at work (when do you ever see that anywhere???). The special Italian is my favorite, but my dad SWEARS by the cheesesteak!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were ok, nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered a Mediterranean sandwich (vegetarian). There was a small piece of something that looked like bacon. On reporting this to the staff, they just gave me a puzzled and indifferent look with no interest in helping me out. I had asked for a sandwich without cucumbers, but... the sandwich was loaded with cucumbers. Not a great experience for me."}
{"text":"Clean, well lit, good food, and BEER! This location's cheesesteaks are almost as good as the original in Oakland, and our kids really enjoy the Italian sub. The fries you get as a side when you order in are pretty basic, but tasty and compliment the food nicely.  While the idea of the Ultra subs is nice (more steak and toppings), the bread/meat/topping taste ratio does not taste as good as their regular offerings."}
{"text":"I love Uncle Sams! Their fries are thin and crispy and delicious. They are always friendly and accommodating to my special requests."}
{"text":"So this spot is tucked away in a little plaza. We had went to Comcast and saw that Uncle Sams was near so we decided that we needed to stop.  Well i decided to get the classic cheese steak sub. It was really good and had the right amount of cheese (this was actually my first time trying Uncle Sam's). The fries were perfect and cooked crispy just the way I like them.  The staff were all pleasant and we received our food pretty quickly. I loved the atmosphere and just the general feeling that other customers were enjoying themselves. Plus I loved the music. 90's and early 2000's is where it's at for me.   I would absolutely recommend this place if you ever feel the need to try a new cheese steak."}
{"text":"I met my sister here for lunch. I had heard great things about this sandwich place, so I was ready to give it a try. I had the filet mignon sub with cheese and fries, and I wasn't disappointed. It was seasoned just right. I will definitely be a return customer. This place gets packed at lunch, so I recommend getting there early."}
{"text":"The food here is honestly awesome! It's really good. But my only complaint is take out. When you eat here, your sub comes with fries. When you order out, you pay the same price, but you do not get fries. Doesn't really make sense, does it? You could even just order and get your food to eat there, then just get it wrapped to go 2 min later. So I really do not understand this, it makes no sense! So if your eating there, I highly recommend it. I do not recommend it for take out though."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon, the place is really friendly and probably will be the reason I do go back.   On the downside, the food was okay and the credit card machine was running REALLY slow."}
{"text":"Two visits for take out orders were enough to convince me not to return. The sandwiches were OK, hence 3 stars. It's the snarky, overly-familiar and slightly condescending attitude from the staff that's the big turn off at Uncle Sam's. FYI- cash only!"}
{"text":"3rd favorite sub place ever! They have a great sub selection and delicious fries. The service is always quick and the portions are just the right size."}
{"text":"I was waiting for some work on my car to be done at the nearby NTB and decided to stop in based on the reviews.  The place has a great decor and was very clean. The service was courteous but not real friendly.   I ordered the cheese steak which comes with fries.  The bread was top notch and the cheese steak was great as well.  The fries are also great and they give you a lot of fries. Really could not eat them all.  Overall pretty good.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"Went out for lunch with some friends and one of them recommended Uncles Sam's. Sandwiches are pretty good their meat to bread is on point. The crazy thing is about this place is the sandwiches are packed with meat and yes the whole sandwich stays in one piece and doesn't fall a part. The place has a old school style to it. Recommend!!"}
{"text":"No other place I will buy subs, fully loaded, too much to eat, have to take home left overs  fries are crisp but in a good way. Never left not satisfied."}
{"text":"Best steak and cheese around. Great shoestring fries as well. Restaurant is small, though, and it fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Great place for a cheesesteak and fries! If your looking for something greasy this is your place. They have malt vinegar for your fries too."}
