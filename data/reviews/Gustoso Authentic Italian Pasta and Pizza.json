{"text":"Good service.  Greasy, inconsistent and canned sauce taste. Not impressed. Been there 2 times and bread sticks were different each time."}
{"text":"The place looks simple, but the food is very unique and the staff was very friendly.  We had the pizza.   Don't expect it to be anything like any chain pizza restaurant.  Pizza was great!  I tried the Tiramisu, and I thought it was so-so.  Either way, I will be back again."}
{"text":"Simple place with some great food. I got the carbonara and my wife got the bolognese. We both loved them. I loved the noodles they use and they were cooked to perfection. We got the larges and had leftovers. I'm sure a small would have been fine. Service was fast and friendly. Can't wait to try their pizza but with the pasta so good it'll be tough not ordering that."}
{"text":"A small place with about 10 tables.  We both had pasta dishes which were great.   a-la-cart salad & bread sticks.  Only soft drinks.  Service was fast and prices were reasonable.  I liked that they offered a small & full size on the pasta dishes.

PROs - the main dish, 5 stars for a small town Italian.

CONs - the bread sticks were just bread sticks (3 stars), with as good as the pasta is I would have expected more.  

Total = 4 stars  Hope they get a wine list sometime.  No doubt that I will be back."}
