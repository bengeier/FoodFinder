{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've had, may be a little too large!! Lasagna was very good and the home made sauce is outstanding. The cannoli's are to die for. The owner and his staff were very friendly and helpful, good people to have as neighbors. I will eat there many times in the near future. Keep up the good work and delicious food."}
{"text":"What a ripoff....  Almost $14 for a 8 inch sandwich stuffed with meat in a 2 inch wide roll.  Stale at that.  Can't even hold the sandwich.  Better off going to Ferucci's  Italian market up the road.  Also noted when there they had Pannetone bread for $13.  The same exact bread was sold at Costco's over the holiday for $7.  Prices are ridiculous for best case average offerings.  I for one will never shop at Derado's again."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out. I needed to buy some ricotta , but I was on a budget . They said $10 a pound and I figured I needed 4-5 pounds . I am not sure how much I usually use because normally I buy the containers . I was explaining to him that the place down the street has the containers I need and use because I wasn't sure the amount in them , and I guess I was just thinking out loud. Well he was explaining something to his wife, and she looked at me, waved her hand and said let her go somewhere else.   So we did."}
{"text":"Food is ok if you are missing the New York italian market scene. But I feel it is way over priced. Understanding that it is a specialty shop, it is still too over priced. I also feel the woman that works there needs better customer relations skills. I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Disgusting food, very rude people. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"The nicest owners you could ask for. I came in with an Italian recipe and no clue how to execute it. They talked me through the recipe and how to cook the ingredients. If you want quality italian ingredients and great customer service, then look no further. Their sandwiches look amazing, too."}
{"text":"Walked in looking to buy a bolonese for up coming dinner party.  Talked to gentlemen behind the counter.  Could't give me a quote.  Gave me his card and told me to call his wife who does quotes in the afternoon.  Last time shopping here was years ago.  Customer service/attitude hasn't changed.  Won't be calling or going back. Suggestion take the customer info and call them back if you want to grow your business."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Fresh bread, top level meats, and all Italian perfection. Cater your next gathering from here and your guaranteed to have people asking where you went. I will be back here again to enjoy some of the best sandwiches I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!  My neighbor brought me here to get pizza, which was really great, but the owner, who was behind the counter asked if I've ever been in the shop before, and when I said I hadn't- he pulled out all the stops! Next thing I know, I'm sampling things left and right.  They have eggplant sliced really thin, breaded and then fried...and I think they must have had a magical unicorn give them this recipe, bc it was the best eggplant I've ever tasted. Seriously, stop reading this and go order some sliced eggplant- I think they have a hero that comes with it inside.  The pizza was really great- I'm from NY, so I always hesitate when I see pizza elsewhere.  The family that runs this place is from NY though, and brought their Italian cooking talents to NC. Fantastic place. The only thing is that it's a take out place, so take it home or bring it to the park nearby and enjoy- I suggest ordering before hand if you know what you want, because its onlya  one-or-two man shop...so you may be waiting a little bit for your food if you order more than one thing. Made to order pizza, btw.  They have a lot of Italian specialty ingredients for sale as well, if you want to get fancy in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Hucksters! John met me at the door and I immediately got the the full service con of a Sham Wow sales pitch. \"Everything is made by hand!\" \"Family recipes!\" \" My aunts make these cookies!\" These are lies.    I purchased 1 lb. of \"homemade\" Italian sausage that was NOT fresh and in fact was right at death's door...when I got it home, it smelled a bit funky. I also purchased 1 portion of eggplant parmesan (over seasoned), half a pound of stuffed mozzarella (good), and 1/2 a pound of stuffed olives. Final bill was $55.50.   The aggressive sales approach by the owner would be welcome if it was actually rooted in passion. It's not. It's dishonest. John gave me samples, which is nice, were it not for the relentless banter about how all of the products are homemade by family. (I don't believe this) It never stopped. He walked me down the deli cases, all the while talking it up and then introduced me to his wife who immediately pulls out a binder of photos and menus of deli sandwiches and again, a sales pitch. This is where the red flags went up. At this point I've been in this deli for about 20 mins. I'm ready to go. I pay my bill. Sticker shock! $55 for about 2.5 lbs. of food? What? And as if to add insult to injury, the lovely wife tries to sell me a loaf of \"homemade\" bread and pushes more menus and daily specials to me before I leave.   If you review the 5 star reviews of Derado's, You find 2 common mentions: Family and sandwiches. Family because the owner is an expert at selling his products as \"family made\". Sandwiches because they are piled high NY deli-style. No doubt, there is good food to be had here (think sandwiches), but be wary. There is a bunch of bullshitting going on here and if you are not food-savvy, you will be dragged into it, hook, line and sinker. You will pay a premium price for it and it will not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Like walking into my nana's kitchen, I sampled everything.   Sandwich: it  is well worth the money because it is loaded with meats; I had some for lunch and two days later I made a panzanella salad with the crusty bread and the meats; the rolls are incredible when fresh but after a few days they are hard, so I ripped up pieces and fried in a little olive oil- like croutons.   Favorites: the Italian Wedding cookies, they are little cakes. The mozzarella roll-ups with spinach and Italian spices are pricey but well worth it , as they are carefully packaged on top of a fresh tomato slice and olive oil. Heather can make a simple side salad that comes with olive oil that is so good, I would drink it. The meatballs are great and I am excited to try more of their Italian specialties."}
{"text":"Do you like bread? You haven't had any until you've eaten their's! Wow. Grab dinner to go but don't forget the bread and cookies!"}
{"text":"I can't help but update my review:  I can't comment on things I haven't tried (e.g. lasagna, etc.), but consider:  In NY, Italian cold cuts run 10-14 dollars a pound.  Look at the photo's of the sandwiches...most have WELL over a pound of meat.  How much then, do you think the sandwich will cost?   Derado's can be pricey.  They serve top cuts of meats and cheeses.  They target the upper crust.  I too, got the full tour upon entering the establishment, which was a bit much.  I sincerely doubt it was anything more than wanting to make the community familiar with all that they have to offer, which is a lot.  Next time i'm in the area I will have to try some of their other offerings..."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian!  Family owned.  I was greeted by the owner as I first entered.  Friendly and fun.  There is a great many choices from subs, pizza, pasta meals and desserts.  I personally had an Italian sub.  This sub was HUGE.  Had to cut into thirds.  DID NOT finish.  Leftovers!  Also got some pesto and olive oil for dipping with the Italian bread made fresh daily.  Everything was great and plan on ordering a pizza this weekend."}
{"text":"You don't have to visit New York to go to a real deli now! Sandwiches are twice as big as subway and they use REAL meat and fresh ingredients. Authentic Italian dishes and desserts. Stop buying crap at chain places and head somewhere that will give you a delicious meal at a competitive price!  This place carries a ton of food using old school recipes their family made up almost a century ago!   Never had eggplant quite like this and their canoli filling is out of site!"}
{"text":"5 stars! Definitely 5 stars! I wish i could give them more. I now know that there are ITALIAN COOKIES close to Charlotte! And not just like a $15 variety pack like other places try to pass off. I'm talking 2 cases full of Italian cookies! Derado's is the only place in the south I have ever seen the set up. There are also cannolis, Italian deli meats, cheeses, 3lb sandwiches and so much more! Might as well call Derado's Heaven instead. Seriously. Then to top it all off, from the moment you walk in the owners treat you like a member of the family. Be prepared to spend a little bit of time sampling items and hearing about the delicious family recipes. It's an overall wonderful experience that's totally worth the drive a bit north of town."}
{"text":"Based on my experiences, would not recommetn  I've tried Derado's a couple of years ago and was very diappointed. Ordered Lasagna for a family get together and it was horrible.  The pasta was like cardboard with the same taste, very little meat and the sauce had a metallic taste.  Owner in an argumentative tone, told me I did not heat it properly.  I was in the neighborhood and decided to give it another try earlier this week. Ordered one of their sandwiches to go and when I got it home, it was horrible.  I've lived in Italian Communities before and I know what a good Italian Deli is suppose to be like and this one misses the mark.  Would no recommend"}
{"text":"How a LEGEND is BORN! !! ! ! !  Better than ANY Sandwich in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County!  Onion sliced almost Paper-thin and Tomato to match!!!  The Meats : : Ham, Salami, Cappicolla, Prosciutto sliced super thin and piled high!!!  Chopped Roasted Red Peppers, Mild Provolone Cheese, Balsamic Vinegar, Oil and Hard flavorful Bread (I'm used to a bread that is much softer, still this was very good)! I ordered it without black olives and without lettuce...Next time I'll get EXTRA Onions!!!   Delicious \"Italian\" Sandwich, maybe too big to call a sandwich!  I was happy only eating Half and almost \"full\" (meaning a little beyond satisfied, I NEVER get Full, EVER!!!) finishing this Super Stacked 12 inch  Italian Sub (I said almost)!  When I return I will order this exactly the same (extra Onions) in a Wrap instead to see what I think!  Mostly a take out Market, no tables inside, though three small tables outside!  The Desserts looked Great too!"}
{"text":"My parents (who live in Cornelius) first tried Derado's following a friend's recommendation and had a fine experience.  They have been back several times since and enjoyed their meals -- very much in line with the other reviews.    This is why they decided to order a large portion of Derado's homemade lasagna for our 2013 Christmas dinner (I was in town visiting from Manhattan).  We were planning to serve a larger-than-normal proportion of people (and small children), which is why we opted for something easy and more broadly appealing as lasagna.    Unfortunately, the lasagna was not up-to-par with Derado's usual standards.  Once we reheated the pans to serve our party, it became clear that the seasoning was off.  More specifically, the sauce was incredibly spicy.  And I'm not talking about just a bit of heavy-handed seasoning, I'm talking about an overwhelming flavor of spicy crushed red pepper that made the lasagna nearly inedible.  In fact, it was all everyone would talk about at the party, which was incredibly disappointing.  Especially considering what we paid.  My stepfather and brother-in-law went in to Derado's this afternoon to make the management aware of our disappointing experience and were met with nothing but stubborn arrogance.  First of all, we understand this is \"Uncle Vinnie's special recipe,\" however, a polite heads-up that this particular recipe includes an overwhelming proportion of red pepper spice would have been nice.  I'm completely serious when I say not a single adult at our party (Italians included) felt the lasagna was edible.  All this on top of an insult from the team at Derado's that people from North Carolina don't know good Italian sealed the deal on this place for us.  (Note: I've lived in NYC for over 6 years now, have had my fair share of authentic Italian, and this was by far the worst.)  Honestly, it's just disappointing that Derado's wasn't open to hearing our feedback as local customers.  Almost half as disappointing as the lasagna we ended up serving all of our guests on Christmas day."}
{"text":"I am from Buffalo NY. I know what an Italian market is. This place aims to please and they do a great job of pleasing. They are the real thing! If you are looking for a super authentic Italian sandwich/sub or Italian fare you MUST come here. I haven't enjoyed an Italian sub in years because I was raised with true authentic Italian food and since moving here I haven't found any Italian place I'm willing to go back to after one visit. I'm hard to impress when it comes to Italian food. The owners are friendly and treat you like family. The sandwich which I had (Italian mix) was beyond amazing... You can't get it that delicious at any other market in the area. We were so impressed we almost called to tell them how great their sandwich was, but we figured a review would go a lot further. Be sure to stop by, your taste buds will be thanking you for it."}
{"text":"My wife and I went into Dorados for the first time today. I'm from a big NY Italian family and have lived in Italy. When we walked in, the owners greeted us and gave us a tour of the shop and an explanation of all their products, exactly like they do in small town Italian shops. They were so friendly and welcoming.   As far as food, we have only tried the meatballs and cannolies so far but both were amazing. The meatballs are like my mothers. They're so delicious. And the Cannoli cream -- I almost wish I had not tried it because now I'm just going to want to eat them all the time.  All the food is made fresh and they only make a certain amount of each thing so next time we will call ahead and place and order so we can reserve some fresh motzerella.   Some reviews have commented that the price is high and it is compared to the grocery store. But when you're talking about cannoli cream that's hand whipped and products trucked in from a small Italian family, you're going to pay a premium. I thought for fresh specialty food, the price was good. The meatballs are hand rolled and seasoned -- this isn't Publix.   For sure, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 sandwiches which cost over $60. I'm sorry, but that is absolutely ridiculous. We got home and tried to eat them like a normal sandwich and couldn't. The bread was so hard we had to cut it into bite size pieces. The cannolis are good. The sample was the best part of my experience. I haven't been back/ won't. We go to Ferruccis now. Half the price, and everything's delish."}
{"text":"The pictures will not do this place justice. Amazing service and quality food. Family owned and everything is made by his family in new york. Hands down best italian deli in Charlotte area."}
{"text":"As always, I had an amazing experience at my favorite Italian Gourmet spot. Today I tried their personal pizza (the sundried tomato and artichoke) and it made me yell out \"Oh yeah!\" Heather and Johnny each personally came outside to check on me and I cant speak highly enough about these two. If you haven't tried their eggplant park sandwich, or their grandmother's cannoli recipe, or their homemade ricotta cheese... You are missing out. I love this place!"}
{"text":"HUGE sandwiches on their fresh baked Italian bread, piled high with really quality meats, cheeses and other fixings.  I could stop there and give 5 stars but there is so much more.  All kind of Italian products from their family.  Sauces, bottled peppers, etc, etc.  It goes on and on and it's all trucked down from NY by their trucking company.    There is a great selection of meats and cheeses you can buy deli style and lot's of homemade, pre-made entrees and salads to pick up and eat at home.  It is a family run joint and they are very welcoming.  Once they find out it's your first visit, you get the full treatment with an explanation of their history, family connections of all the products and, best of all, sample after sample of their fare.  By the time that portion was over, I almost was not feeling like ordering the sub I had come in for... Almost....  I give myself 1 star on this though because Derado's has been literally just down the street for quite a while now and I just last month made the trip in to explore.  Shame on me!"}
{"text":"Great NY-style deli.  The prepared food section didn't look overly fresh but we ordered an Italian sub and it was done very well.  The bread was fresh, warm and crispy and the meat was very fresh and flavorful.  The homemade Italian dressing was a nice touch and it was a huge sandwich.  We also picked up some of their fresh pasta, vodka sauce, and baguettes for bruchetta.  Everything turned out very well!!    They allowed us to sample some of the baked goods and the cannoli filling was excellent!  One of the owners talked for about 30 minutes so I can't say we got in and out of there quickly but overall we were pleased with the product."}
{"text":"We were really in the mood for some great Italian food and found our way in to Derados today. Wow! Not only was the food outstanding, but the owners, Johnny and Heather were awesome! They took their time to explain all the food and gave us samples of various items. They shared the history of the recipes and made sure every question was answered. It truely felt like they invited us into their home, not just their market. I would (and will) highly recommend Derados to all of my friends. Thank you guys so much for the wonderful hospitality and awesome food."}
{"text":"My quest for sausage casings led me to Derado's.While they did not carry the sausage casings, I did end up finding something even better...an Italian market that reminded me of the New York-style places I left behind after moving to the area. The owner, John,  was ridiculously friendly, even more so when he realized that I wasn't only Italian but also raised in New York (as he is.) He runs a clean shop with all sorts of Italian treats, and I was very happy to find such a place.  The store carries a ton of Italian grocery staples like fresh pasta, jarred sauces and fresh sausages (all imported from his family's businesses in New York and New Jersey.) Aside from that he also does some hot specials that you can buy by the pound like eggplant parm, lasagna and that kind of food. He also makes his own pizza with the dough hand-tossed to order, and he also sells the dough separately. We had been buying our pizza dough from Harris Teeter, but he sold it for less so we decided to give it a whirl. Along with the hot foods and pizza he also carries a variety of Italian deli meats and cheeses, and makes some pretty massive sandwiches.  However, my biggest interest with Derado's was the bakery items. The miss' worked for an Italian bakery in New York so we were used to all those sweet treats. It was awesome to find the same quality goods down here. He had a good selection of Italian cookies as well as some dynamite-looking cannoli shells, napoleons and other pastries. He gave us a sample of the cannoli cream and it was pretty darn tastetacular, and I doubt you'll find any better in the area.   Then he did something that blew my mind...he showed us his special cannoli cream desserts. As if stuffing that wonderful cream into a fresh, crisp shell wasn't good enough, he actually found a higher calling for the cream. He has three \"sandwich desserts\" to choose from, in which he plops a generous amount of the cannoli cream between giant chocolate chip cookies, brownies, or, and my personal favorite, black and white cookies. If you've had a black and white cookie before, you know how awesome that cakey treat is. Now imagine two of those sandwiched around a mass of cannoli cream! Soooo amazing!!!  There is only one thing I would like to add about Derado's which might have an impact on some people. It's not cheap. With most of his food either imported or made with imported ingredients, his prices are a bit higher than you would expect. Don't get me wrong...the quality of the food is top-notch, and definitely worth the price. If you're looking for some traditional Italian eats, and you want to spoil yourself, then definitely come down to Derado's and take a gander."}
{"text":"I stopped in today after researching yelp looking for a real Italian deli that serves real New York style sandwiches. I found it! right when i walked in the owners gave me a tour and history of the store and the products sampling along the way. I decided on the Italian Mix which could feed a family! I knew I could only eat half and i was challenged at that. the rest will be lunch tomorrow. I have found a new favorite in my quest for the worlds best eats!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go!!! We always make the hour drive for my birthday meal to go here.  Our favorite sub is the abbundenza it's huge, and amazing. They are always so nice to cut it into as many portions as we need. My dad came to this country when he was a kid...  I grew up to authentic Italian food..  so many things here bring me back to so many memories of my childhood.  And the cannoli... omg the cannoli.....  I have to make another trip soon just to indulge in some cannolis. The cream is close to the best I have ever had!!!!  We love Johnny and Heather. Great people, wish them all the best. They really do make you feel like you are visiting your Italian family when you see them."}
