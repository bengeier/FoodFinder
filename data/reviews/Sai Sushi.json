{"text":"Hands down the best sushi spot in Vegas! Such a nice crew and the food is amazing! The 911 special is SO GOOD!! Everything tastes so fresh and flavorful! The atmosphere is very welcoming and Juliana really makes you feel at home. Kay is such and amazing waitress and Sean is THE BEST sushi chef in Vegas. Love them!"}
{"text":"OMG !!!The food here was great and the service was fantastic! I feel so sad that I have not known this place for such a long time. The new chef and the chef who works on the weekends got some lovely skills. Definitely deserve a five star and worth spending time with delicious sushi!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this sushi restaurant last night and it was such an amazing and unexpected experience. We have been coming to Sai for many years now but this experience was so wonderful it finally prompted me to write a review!
We started off ordering some typical sushi rolls but when we saw that they had fresh halibut we had to get that. After we ordered the halibut, the owner stepped in and started suggesting other stuff to us, such as the live razor clam and Japanese style duck confit, which we ordered. Everything was so delicious and the presentation was beautiful. We ended our meal with the sake raspberry ice cream which was so light and tasty. We will definitely be back soon with more friends and family. 

If you come to this restaurant DO NOT waste your time and money ordering rolls! Check out the white insert that has Today's Specials instead."}
{"text":"So the staff was super friendly, and the appetizers were ordered were tasty, however I came here under the impression of other yelp reviews talking about all you can eat (AYCE). Turns out they do not have AYCE or the 5 course meal I saw somewhere on these reviews. Good place just didn't have what I was looking for."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here many times for the all you can eat sushi. Every time the sushi was always fantastic. My family and I came in the other night and noticed the large sign hanging out front stating \"under new management\" \"all you can eat sushi\". After being seated and trying to order the all you can eat, we were told they are no longer doing that. They could care less what the sign out front said. We ended up walking out.  It's a shame that they changed and we won't go back. This was a nice place that was never crowded. Hope they will be able to stay in business because of their change."}
{"text":"So glad we tried this place for AYCE Sushi. Fantastic service and we really liked the atmosphere. The sushi selection was spot on and the Salmon was fresh and a nice portion on the Nigiri. Was sad to see there wasn't too many people in the restaurant for lunch but that didn't stop the staff from being really welcoming and cheery.  Bonzai Roll was my favorite."}
{"text":"Dinner was fantastic once again.  Tried several new specials, lady gaga, amberjack w/jalepagos and something  with apples.  Delicious!!  Our server Kay was fantastic as well, we really enjoyed her personality."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a fast bite and was very impressed by the freshness of the fish.. WOW!!!!! I've definitely put this place on my top 5 sushi joints.. service was just as good.. try this place before it slipps off the map like so many other All you can eat places.. no joke it's the bomb.."}
{"text":"We just move to the area and decided to try out our neighborhood sushi place. We are sushi lovers and hands down Sai Sushi is one of the best sushi restaurants we have ever gone too and my wife managed two sushi restaurants in the past, so she knows her sushi. They use top grade fish and ingredients, the rolls we tried (sx on the beach and pastor shon) were out of this world.

The service was excellent and personal, waited on not only by the server but also by Megan, the owner.

We plan on coming here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Good for take out / delivery because you can order directly on Yelp. Large portions & interesting combinations. Not the best sushi of my life but it was good quality for take out."}
{"text":"Not sure why we don't come here more often.  Food and service was great!  I'm always impressed with the specials."}
{"text":"So glad to have decided to try this place. So close to my house. Ordered my usual sushi combo...Hamachi, salmon and eel. ALL excellent. Ordered the salmon lover roll...perfect. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Bam Bam roll was missing the avocado and cucumber. Ramen- asked for no onions, it had onions. Forgot to bring my soda also. Yeah, it was my first and last time!!"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant a few weeks ago and thought about giving it a try. So glad that I did, Amazing food, very attentive service. I will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times in the past year.  The sushi was always fresh and delicious.  The all you can eat offer was a great deal and a main reason that I continued to patronize this restaurant.
When I went last weekend I was informed that there is no longer the all you can eat option. They now have a $30 dollar fixed  menu option.  The reason for the bad  review is that the quality of the food was so poor this time, that some of the food was not even eaten by the group I was with.  Everyone in the group commented that the food quality was poor and none  of us would ever return.  Sushi Sai WAS a nice restaurant, but it is time to find a new sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very clean.  My wife and I ordered the Garlic Edamame, shrimp fried rice, the 911 roll, and the OMG roll.  Everything was fantastic.  The service was great and fast."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi spot in Henderson. Outstanding customer service, great food for a great price. I have been to many sushi places here in town but this is definitely one of the better ones. The owner's could not be nicer, and really go out of their way for you. I moved about 2 miles from here and come down at least once a week, never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I ordered halibut sashimi and oysters, and they were very fresh and tasty. The appetizers were very delicious, too. One of the best sushi places."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I sat at the sushi bar and the chef was very nice and made specialty rolls for me. I also had a yellow tail salad with cucumber and tomato. The atmosphere was lovely and serene. An excellent place for a quiet lunch. I kinda wish they had a happy hour but I will definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant, now called Sai Sushi, was previously En Sushi and is still on this Yelp listing as of this date.  My husband and I have gone several times to this restaurant and loved it.  We have traveled across town for years to our favorite sushi place but now we don't have to go outside Anthem!  We have been pleasantly surprised at the quality, flavor, decor & cleanliness.  The servers are so nice and accommodating.  The sushi chef, Aiden, is the bomb.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Five stars all the way! My mom and I went here for the first time today for dinner and everything was delicious. There is happy hour on food and drinks every day from 3-8 pm..20 percent off everything! They also have lunch special during the day. Food was fresh and very very good. Megan was so kind!! We will definitely be going back. Thanks so much :)"}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh, amazingly delicious. My favorite is the sex bomb roll and their unagi (eel), but almost everything here will be a nice surprise. The staff couldn't be nicer. It's like the best kept secret in Henderson. I'm always happy I went.

They're all-you-can-eat option is probably your best bet, because you can try ANYTHING and find out what you like. From their sashimi to their soups and specialty rolls, you can try whatever you want. Amazing value,  very fresh. Their mango yogurt drink is definitely worth a try. 

If you're not sure what you want, or you want something special, just ask. They make rolls special for your taste. They made ours a little less spicy. Can't ask for any better."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hiddem gem. Excellent service, and the quality of fish is amazing. By far one of the best sushi restaurants in town. I love how intimate it feels."}
{"text":"I love coming here ... Sushi is always delicious and fresh , service is great . New owner is super friendly . I like the lunch special ... They have choice of 2 rolls for 10$ . Great deal ! Also , not as crowded as other sushi places in the area . Closed on Mondays ... That's the only thing I don't like ."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this restaurant for their AYCE dinner - it was delicious and the service was GREAT. We were spoiled by the owner (so nice). She learned it was my birthday and gave me a gift - plus a chef's special treat (yummy!). We also brought our own chocolate b-day cake which she helped serve up with cutting and plating. Very cool. This place is super welcoming, the setting is nice, and again, the food is YUMMY. I highly recommend. By the way, there is a coupon is the 89052 booklet mailer. :) 
Some added insight: AYCE price - $26.95 - they also do takeout and DELIVERY!!!
You MUST go check it out and indulge. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Inspirada this week and ordered from Sai Sushi after reading positive reviews.  We placed our order at 6:22pm and it's now 8:15pm and we still haven't gotten our food delivered.  The delivery driver called at 7:18, but spoke little English and didn't know where our address was. The restaurant wrote down our address wrong and after repeated calls wondering where our food was, the restaurant continues to tell us the driver is about 10 minutes away.  After refusing to pay at this point, she asked me to at least tip the driver.  Are you serious?  Why would I tip the driver when this entire first experience has been miserable and not our fault the restaurant wrote and communicated our address incorrectly to their driver?  She apologized but at this point, I'm not sure I'm giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Excellent, very fresh sushi. The lobster roll is amazing."}
{"text":"Sushi was very good, fresh and menu has a lot to choose from.  All u can eat was reasonable and selection great.

We came here for our friends birthday and the owner came out spoke with us.  Very nice and inviting.  She even gave my friend a present and gave us a chef's special dish. 

We will come back here again, if just for the excellent service."}
{"text":"My new Favorite sushi in Henderson. Great creative fresh sushi. Friendly staff and a good atmosphere. They have a new sushi chef and he is fantastic. Their tuna is so fresh, we eat here whenever we get sushi cravings. Try the unique chef specials, everyone we have had has been great!"}
{"text":"OMG!! I was just rushed out of this restaurant because the hostess (who I guess is the owner) wanted to close the restaurant. What the heck! It was a little before 9 pm and the 'hours of operation' painted on the glass near the entry said they were open until 9:30 pm. I had 3/4 of a beer left, had recently received an order of amaebi nigiri and was still eating my salmon salad (had most of it left). The hostess turned off the lights in the main part of the restaurant. I was sitting at the sushi bar. She came and said they were closing, so could they pack my food so they could close. I will never go back again!! How incredibly rude!! I could understand if I was still eating and it was after the posted 'hours of operation', but this...this is unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"First time since there is new ownership. It was very good. Service great and sushi was fresh and tasty. Ambience is relaxing and friendly. I recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"I just moved to Henderson and found this place on yelp. So we ordered online and the sushi is really really good they sent us 3 kind of sauces beside soy sauce which is I what I loved the most. Second time we decided to try the location, they're very welcoming the owner is so nice she kept checking on us every time she had the chance. But I don't know why they stopped giving sauces on delivery !!"}
{"text":"I've always ordered delivery, never had the chance to go sit down at the actual restaurant. Nonetheless, the sushi is absolutely delicious. Definitely my favorite place. I always order something different each time and have never been disappointed. My order is always correct, the rolls are fresh and still warm every time. Props to the sushi chef and staff, everything is always on point! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's so intimate and all the fish is fresh and because they're are mostly take out, you get your own personal experience.  If you ever have a chance to just sit in, please do, it's so quiet and fancy.  I hope this place stays here for a long time, because they are definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"The rolls were excellent and the server was very attentive. The prices were very reasonable, especially since we were there during happy hour. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from LA and I found the perfect sushi stop! I had the all-you-can-eat, and I was really surprised by the quality of the sushi that we ordered! My favorite was the white tuna! We also ordered the Anthem roll and Sai-Wow roll, but of which were tasty! The anthem roll had a kick, but not too spicy! 

The service was awesome!!! The atmosphere was very friendly. Truly a 5-star experience! I will be coming back the next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Checked out Yelp and found this place on a Friday night.  It was not busy as I would have thought for a Friday night. Small place pretty low key. 

Regardless of it not being busy, with only about 9 customers, we like it. It was tasty and for us sushi is always a treat. We had a variety of rolls: Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, California, Rainbow, and Spicy Crab all good.  

The sushi chef was pretty spirited, into sports and also giving customers history on sushi and different styles.  The waitress was attentive so we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Sai Sushi is a diamond.  Food was outstanding, jalapeño yellowtail and Sumo roll were outstanding.  Service was great.  Not much more to be said here, you have to try this place.  Decor is great, sujo shot was wonderful, if you're not eating here, you're missing out.   Truly a 5 star gem."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Anthem, Green Valley and  probably all of Vegas. check it out by Googling their Master Chef Sochio Kojima"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm not sure why 3 rolls cost me 50 bucks but totally not worth it. The food was mediocre and crazy expensive. I will be eating there NEVER!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant. 

We have a new neighbor who raves about this new restaurant, and he's of Japanese decent and a master sommelier at a five star restaurant on the Strip.  I was sold!

So we came in tonight as a family and had a blast; great food, great service and an excellent menu. That staff is very friendly! The food is so good. You just can't go wrong. 

Just down the street is I LOVE SUSHI, which is excellent. But, En Sushi is just as good with friendlier service and a prettier ambience and much quieter experience.  

We love it here. We will be back. 

Give them a try, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to give this place a try, one bad review wasn't going to scare us! We're so glad we did, the Chef and staff were really friendly, creative and everything he made was absolutely AMAZING! The Chef even made us a few items (currently) off the menu, I hope they make it on because I can not stop thinking about them. Flavor combinations were on point, no soy sauce needed. You can tell the Chef really cares about his craft with the extra effort put into everything. He even made the krab taste better, which I usually avoid opting for just raw fish in the roll. We can't recommend this place enough, amazing service and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I came here by mistake assuming it was a sushi restaurant I've previously ate at, once I pulled into to parking lot I knew this wasn't the same place but I ordered take out and did not want to be rude and not pick up my order. I stopped in maybe 1 hour before closing time and that's exactly the service I received. The sushi was not fresh, very hard and just not what I expected after I saw they had 5 stars. It was a waste of $20 and I felt very sick after eating a few. The fish is not fresh and has a foul odor. I will not order from here again."}
{"text":"I'm working my way through some of our local delivery places, and Sai Sushi is high on my list of good calls. I initially chose them because they had the cheapest minimum order, which made it reasonable for me to get food just for myself. I had some absolutely excellent salmon and yellowtail rolls. The udon was basic but good. I'll definitely order again."}
{"text":"My wife and I are San Fernando Valley Sushi heads all the way. Some of the best Sushi in the world on Ventura Blvd, it's a fact! 

We have been searching all of Las Vegas for an all you can eat with great quality sushi, comfortable upscale decor, and friendly atmosphere. Sai delivers on all fronts. 

Great job guys! The nigiri is buttery soft and delicious. We couldn't get enough. The apps were equally tasty with all of the guilty pleasure type rolls to match. We will be coming back soon!!!!!!

Choi the chef killed it btw. Complements to the chef and Jay our server"}
{"text":"The food here is just delicious! It's in a small strip plaza, just a little out of the way if you didn't know to look. The decor is lovely and comfortable. We had a very pleasant experience! I will be returning soon! My favorite is the Sex on the Beach roll. Also, they offer 20% off from 2-6pm - Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this restaurant. The food was off.. the salmon smelled and tasted off."}
{"text":"So I've kind of grown to become a sushi snob... I probably have it once or twice a week. I've never been to Sai, but I live in Anthem, and I love supporting the small businesses in the area. I've been meaning to come here, and when my dad pointed out that they have an AYCE deal for $26.99, we decided to have dinner here tonight.

Not a soul in the restaurant. Kind of made me weary of our decision to come here, but I actually really enjoyed it. Chris (server/cook), Julianna (waitress), and Cho (sushi chef) were really nice and accommodating! They really took their time to ensure we had a good experience. I left super full, and once again satiated my sushi needs.

One thing I think separates them from all the other sushi joints is that they deliver! Man, when I heard that, I was elated! (Pro postmater/lazy butt over here lol)... Delivery charge is only $4--sweet! I don't know how well raw fish goes by delivery but their cooked dishes were pretty darn tasty too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff !! Would definitely recommend to anyone in Las Vegas. Great sushi places are hard to find ! Their delivery services are extremely excellent as well. My order was well put together  and it came perfectly fancy as well."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Sai for the first time tonight. We had the AYCE sushi. Every roll was delicious! (There was very very minimal wait time in between ordering rolls.) The service was fantastic! Our waiter, Juan, was attentive, friendly, and made fantastic suggestions when we were ordering. The price was extremely reasonable. It came to $46 for 2 with the coupon in the 89052 book. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service! Excellent food. Close to home. A little pricey though but overall no complaints. Happy hour is 3 to 8p and 20% off. Most places though is 50% off. They serve small desert after...no charge."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in Anthem.  We went here cause it is close to us. Ordered some take out from here last night.  $52 worth of the worst fish my wife and I have ever had. We took a couple bites and threw the rest in the garbage.  I don't know if they thought we wouldn't notice but I can tell you that is the last time we will ever go back.  I suspect this place will be out of business soon. 

I give one star cause can't give less"}
{"text":"We used to go to all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants frequently before finding this diamond in the rough in Anthem. We decided to try a new place on the eve of our annual engagement and discovered our favorite sushi joint in Las Vegas/Henderson. The fish is fresh, the portions are phenomenal, the atmosphere is tremendous, presentation is beautiful and the service is incredible. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!

P.S. The five course meal (better than any all you can eat we have had) fills you up and lets you leave with extra food! It offers you:

1. Beer, House Sake, or any Fountain Drink
2. Choice of two appetizers
3. Choice between multiple salads (tuna poke salad included)
4. Choice between six nigiri, six sashimi, volcano, OR choice of any two rolls on the menu, OR  hot combination (we have not tried this yet)
5. Dessert choice of mochi, ice cream, twinkie, and some other stuff I probably forgot to list

We have been here three times in 11 days. Here is everything we have tried to SATISFACTION (from drinks to appetizers to main course to dessert): 

Iced green tea
House sake (part of the 5 course meal menu)
Miso soup
House salad (part of the 5 course meal menu)
Tuna poke salad (part of the 5 course meal menu)
Mixed tempura (part of the 5 course meal menu)
Kimchi fried rice (BEST I have ever had)
Mushroom stuffed w/ chicken (part of the 5 course meal menu)
Bacon wrapped asparagus (part of the 5 course meal menu)
Salmon skin hand roll (BEST we have ever had)
Salmon and assorted nigiri (part of the 5 course meal menu - see photo) 
Salmon Lover Roll (part of the 5 course meal menu - see photo)
Assorted sashimi (part of the 5 course meal menu)
Volcano (part of the 5 course meal menu)

... And probably a variety of other foods I have forgotten to mention. The owner, Julianna, really cares about the customers, food, and restaurant. I'd recommend trying any of their specials as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing hospitality and even better food! The owner was so friendly and very attentive. She made my boyfriend and I feel so welcomed!! Everything that we ordered came out in reasonable time. The presentation of each dish was so precise and well done! The food was prepared very well and everything was fresh. The owner offered us complimentary matcha ice cream (house made) and I have to say it was probably the best matcha ice cream I have ever had! Very happy with my experience here. I will definitely be stopping by if I'm ever in Nevada again!"}
{"text":"Not great but not the worst. Will we return? Not likely. We ordered food via Yelp then picked it up. It said they deliver, but I guess not today. That wasn't a big deal.

We ordered 5 rolls, they all had different ingredients, yet they oddly tasted the same. They were hard to distinguish and they fell apart too easy. Fish didn't taste that fresh. Maybe they were having a bad day, but I definitely wasn't happy with our order. The sauces were on the side, and were all chunky/overly salty. Weird sushi experience. 

Even the basic of all basics--the Philadelphia roll, wasn't good. Which was a shame be once in a while, that ends up my go to, as one of my choices.

Meh. Take caution with this one."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a new owner named Megan and has been renamed to Sai Sushi.   The interior was modern, clean and stylish.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  They answered all my questions and was able to provide great advice.  The food was prepared by their new chef named Sunny.  The food itself was fantastic.  I ordered the \"7 Hills\" roll and highly recommend it.  The food was quickly prepared but did not feel rushed.  There was the perfect amount of sauce and the ingredients tasted very fresh.  Megan, the new owner, was receptive to feedback and genuinely interested in my dining experience.  I am definitely coming back every time I come to Nevada."}
{"text":"I learned about Sai Sushi from my neighbors through NextDoor.  My husband and I decided to check it out, as we live within walking distance of the restaurant.  It is tucked away from the main road, so one cannot see it from the main road.  We were pleasantly surprised.  We were immediately greeted upon entering the premises.  Everyone who worked there made us feel welcome ans special.  We ordered three different items off of the menu, and enjoyed each one.  The food was fresh, beautifully arranged, and really appetizing.  My husband and I will definitely return and recommend the restaurant to anyone who enjoys sushi."}
{"text":"I feel really bad about writing this review because the manager tried to help our situation as much as possible but this place just is not good:( My boyfriend and I are HUGE sushi lovers and go eat it all the time. We decided to switch it up a bit and try somewhere new. This place only has AYCE on Monday and Tuesday's which I thought was a bit weird. Anyways we got there and there was only 1 other group of people in there. We sit down and start to look at the menu, see some stuff that looks good and order it. The first roll comes out and it had tuna on top. The tuna was like mush, room temperature not cold at all and just tasted very bad. The salmon tasted funky as well. Every roll that came out after that was just so bad I felt sick. The fish was not fresh and I kid you not was like mush on every single roll. We wanted to see one more roll before we said anything so I had ordered a poke salad and all the fish on top was so gross. Couldn't even see the color of the fish, it was so mushy it looked like soup on top of the salad. We finally had to say something to the manager and she began to mention that her chef's during the week aren't very good and he messed up. I really don't know how this place is still in business to be honest. Please save yourself a trip and don't go here."}
{"text":"The food was great both fresh and quick (five person group). Friendly service with a smile and sharing a laugh. We live in CA and are here visiting family, really wanted some sushi so we gave this place a shot it is a little off our beaten path but definitely worth the visit! Definitely look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I used bite squad for delivery and did not eat at the establishment. I like that they use Bite Squad as an option otherwise I would not have gone to the restaurant. The food was excellent. The sushi was very fresh. The sushi rice was just right. All of the fish was excellent. I would give 5 stars but they didn't have uni which I believe is a little amateurish. Maybe I'm being harsh and maybe the jet flying in the fresh uni broke down but great sushi restaurants always have Uni. I will definitely order from there again. Next time if they don't have uni then they will get three stars. Next time is they do have uni they will get five stars. If you don't like uni then consider this review 5 stars because for my first time trying this place I really liked their food. I've been eating sushi for 30 years and I know what's good and what's not. SAI has my business for now. Keep up the good work. The chicken fried rice was delicious. They have a very nice menu. A"}
{"text":"I was in the area and my friends and I decided to have ayce sushi for lunch. We ordered nigiri, appetizers, and some rolls and dessert to finish it off. The service was amazing! Friendly staff, and intimate atmosphere. They serve quality fresh fish  and the chef puts just the right amount of rice. I definitely recommend this place and I live in the opposite side of town but I definitely will come out of my way to eat here again!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I LOVE this place! We have been here the past two nights now, because it's that good! The food is amazing, the atmosphere is amazing, and the customer service is amazing! Julianna is so fun! They have the best salmon, and the best tempura! We haven't tried anything that we didn't like! This place is definitely our new fave!"}
{"text":"Very surprised, great service, great sushi! The owner greeted me upon walking in and was super friendly. Chef was great! I hope it stays open because they deliver can't wait to use that option!"}
{"text":"A wonderful sushi spot right near home!!!  Since new ownership took over, not only is the Japanese food delicious but the staff is warm and friendly as well.  And, the sushi is beautiful to look at"}
{"text":"Happen to be on this side of town and was craving some fresh cool sushi on this hot day! Everything we ordered was awesome! Fresh and not over powered with sauce. Service was friendly and good.  It's a bummer I don't live on this side of town, it would probably be my go to sushi spot! Oh, the cold house sake was great too!"}
{"text":"This was my second try with Sai Sushi through a third party on-line delivery service.  Sai Sushi uses it's own delivery personnel unless you pay $4.99 through the third party service.  The first delivery was late (15-20) minutes but the sushi was very tasty.  We decided to try them again tonight and placed an order through same third party service at 6:30PM.  The anticipated delivery date was shown as 7:48 PM.  At 7:49PM, the third party website showed the order delivered.  Needless to say, with no food in hand I was on a chat trying to find our order.  About 20 minutes later, the restaurant called me to say that my order was just being made.  No apologies, just \"we are really busy\".  News flash, don't take the online order or call and make arrangements.  Last time for delivery or walk-in as we will go where our business matters."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the town. Great atmosphere,  high quality of service and staffs are so friendly.  I had some rolls and sushi. I  was soooo satisfied that I had for my dinner. If you want to try, do not hesitate. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great selection of lunch specials: bento boxes and all kinds of sushi. But skip the chicken. It's was rubbery and hard to chew, not sure why it turned out like a eraser. Great assortment of tempura with bento box, more of cake like batter than your light and crispy panko tempura."}
{"text":"Try the OMG sushi! It's delicious. This is a fun place to eat with good service and atmosphere. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"911 Special was amazing! My boyfriend's fav was the Lady Gaga. Atmosphere was nice and Kay and Sean are a lot of fun!! Very sweet and accommodating. We will come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"What a little gem in the Anthem Highlands neighborhood! One of the best Japanese restaurants in the Las Vegas/Henderson area.

Great atmosphere for families and the appetizers, entrees, and Sushi are the real deal. If you are looking for authentic Japanese food, this is a real hidden spot!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Sushi is GREAT, garlic edamame is to die for!! SOJU cocktails are heavenly! Can't rave enough! Visit this place! Owner Julianna is so friendly and attentive!! You NEED to visit this place!"}
{"text":"Really good fresh healthy proportions of fish. 
Wide all you can eat menu
Nice selection of beers/sake
Friendly staff/quick service"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite sushi place in Las Vegas.  The freshest fish and great rolls, plus the owner and the staff are so accommodating and friendly.  They go out of their way to make sure you are 100% happy.  The chef Kojima, is outstanding:  he is a master sushi chef and honestly comes up with the most creative and also delicious dishes and rolls--today I had the lobster sushi and the
Salmon lover roll and both were delish.  Also the toro was super fresh and tender, thumbs up.  It is a little out of the way up Eastern but worth going the extra  1/2 mile to get there.  It is tucked back in an unassuming strip mall behind a Von's, inside it is updated, upscale and very clean.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi here.  The yellowtail is fresh.  They don't skimp on the fish to rice ratio.  Right amount of eel sauce.  Very friendly & enthusiastic owners.  There are lots of sushi joints in town.  This one is worth your business."}
{"text":"This review has long been overdue.  First off the sushi is just awesome.  The best in town in my opinion.  The sashimi is like M&Ms, melt in your mouth.  We usually get the boat when we go. The boat is a miniature wooden ship that has enough room to feed two people easily.  At this point we just tell the owner, Juliana, to fill up the boat and she knows us so well that she comes back with a ship full of goodness.  We then sail away to gluttony.  

There are so many things to try here, I don't know where to start.  Everything is of high quality here.  This place has menu items that you will not find in most sushi restaurants.  I strongly suggest the lobster sushi.  Now, this isn't shredded imitation langostino mixed with mayonnaise.  This is pure actual lobster sushi.  It tastes so fresh that you will think the lobster is pinching you.  We always make sure that we get the duck sashimi, also.  Luscious duck with no bones just drives me quackers.  The live scallop is succulent.  Yes, I said live.  The lamb rib is must each time, also.  Mary has a little lamb, no more.

One of my favorite things at this place is the fruit flavored soju.  This soju is blended with fresh fruit.  They will even blend different fruits together, so you can have blue-strawberry soju if you are so inclined.  These things are so tasty, you may forget you are drinking soju.  Watch out, though.  These things sneak up on you like a lion on its prey.

Dessert is a must at Sai.  All the desserts are good, but my favorite is the beer ice cream.  Two of my favorites come together.  Is this heaven?  Other interesting ice creams include raspberry sake, red wine, coffee, and the ever lovable green tea.

The best part of this place is their owner, Juliana.  She is our favorite owner of all the restaurants we frequent.  She really cares about her customers and does all she can to always provide a great experience.

I strongly suggest this place.  You will like the way Sai rolls and you will think this place is soy awesome."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Yelp, very novel for us as we are new to this area. It took much longer than expected and when I called to inquire about the status, the conversation was just odd. 

We ordered 4 rolls, chicken teriyaki, and potstickers to get a good feel for this place. The potstickers were steamed and delicious. Chicken teriyaki seemed like it was made earlier (when, who knows) and very dry. The rolls were all different, sauces were on the side, and they fell apart easily. My go to is the rainbow, but it was sad. All the fish wasn't that fresh and lacked flavor. 

I've definitely had worse sushi, but I guess I was expecting better based on the ratings."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owner and waitress are incredibly sweet, the sushi is fresh and delicious, and the overall restaurant has a very nice atmosphere. I would come here every day if I could :)"}
{"text":"We hadn't eaten there since they ended the all you can eat sushi.  Back then it was obvious they were \"giving away the store.\"  But this evening we felt like a quick sushi meal and came back.

Unfortunately it was not the same experience as in the past.  The salmon skin hand rolls had a almost teriyaki flavor, the salmon roe was very (and I mean very) salty, and the tuna roll was tiny.  In fact, it was so small that it was chewy from more seaweed than rice and tuna.

I really wish I could have given a 5 star review as I had in the past.  We won't return."}
{"text":"Cute place, great sushi and the server was so friendly and sweet , one of the nicest servers I've ever had . So down to earth ! The chef was so nice to .. love the decor and all the sauces they use with there rolls , very unique , We will be back !"}
{"text":"We love this place. Excellent customer service, good sushi. New owners go above & beyond!"}
{"text":"Great and attentive staff. Great interior design and best of all the sushi was fantastic. The sushi chef made me a special roll he made for Jennifer Aniston and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Apparently the all you can eat menu has been discontinued and they have new management. I'm guessing the new managements goal is to give you the smallest portions possible and make the most money. I got a combination meal with shashimi and a roll and miso soup and salad. The miso soup bowl is the smallest I've ever seen and the spoon barely fits in it. The salad bowl is also very small. The shashimi portion are cut so small there is no way you could even make nigiri with them without it looking like the worlds smallest piece ever and the fish appeared to have coloring added from the supplier. The spicy tuna roll was fresh but very bland and the presentation boring. The shashimi fish tasted very fresh but once again I'm starving after this meal because of the portion size. If you are 120 pound female you maybe full from the meals here. I am now going to get something else to eat after just finishing here."}
{"text":"I had the AYCE Sushi and tried 10 different Sushi rolls, I absolutely loved every single roll I had. The Sushi was fresh and they do not use to much rice like so many others do, other places use a lot of rice to fill you up faster but not here. The service was great and the owner came over, sat down and had a nice conversation with us. Even our server, Juan was friendly, fast, and polite and I give him a 5 star rating as well. Not only do i recommend this place but I will also eat there again and again."}
{"text":"New owners yet again! But they have revamped the menu with ayce.  We were pretty pleased and enjoy the quiet atmosphere!  Very nice new owners, they also will do half rolls which is totally nice!  Sushi is fresh! We will be back especially since its right across the street. They just need to carry some kids juices or something."}
{"text":"Service nice there but the food is horrible . The roll not like roll and not fresh . Not gonna go back again"}
{"text":"My last three orders have been below average to terrible. So disappointed. The fish has been cut in an odd manner, too thick, and has tasted progressively fishier. My last order was inedible, everything got thrown in the trash. The order was wrong, to boot. Ginger and wasabi has often been missing from take out orders. I don't know what's going on but I hope the new chef get things together."}
{"text":"Wow we found a neighborhood gem in this restaurant . The fish is so fresh and the presentation was beyond impressive. Little did we know our chef is the renowned Master Sushi Chef Sachio Kojima.  We will be back, for sure"}
{"text":"I am so sad to update this review negatively but I have to be honest. The food here has gone way downhill over the last 3 months. I tried the food 3 different times before updating this review and determining that I can no longer eat here. I believe they switched chefs because they do not even make the rolls with all of the ingredients that they advertise are in the rolls on the menu. The fish tastes like its frozen bad quality now. Even the rice tastes odd and hard. Everything is sloppily thrown together. When you pick up the rolls with chopsticks they fall apart before it gets to your mouth. This used to be my favorite establishment but honestly you can get better sushi at a mall food court now. I sincerely hope they figure this out soon so that they can stay in business but I will not be returning as a customer to find out."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised.   Ordered several rolls and yellow tail sushi.  So happy to find a place so close to home !! Also, definitely order the Crispy Rice and Tuna App Give it a try !!"}
{"text":"My husband and i stopped in for an early dinner. The place was quiet. It is nicely decorated and dimly lit. They had fresh fish and some unique rolls. We ordered the garlic edamame, a screaming o, and tuna poke to start. They were all very good. We ordered a roll called the anthem roll and it was very good as well. The one thing that was a little off putting was how long we were there. It took a decent amount of time between each item to come to our table. Now this isn't a total draw back, sometimes we enjoy taking an extra long dinner but we hadn't planned on it that night. It took about an hour and a half to eat and pay. The last roll we ordered was the Japanese lasagna and I really like theirs."}
{"text":"Delicious Sushi!!! First time here will be back!! Excellent people and great service!!! #BOOM"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. Highly recommended. The server was very kindly and the chef is very skilled. The food was beyond good. The interior of the place has calm and lovely atmosphere and the customers seemed to enjoy every single second they were here. Once again this place is the best in las vegas."}
{"text":"Great service.  Peaceful environment.  I ordered the teriyaki beef, udon tempura, poki salad and house salad.  Great meal. Will come again. Timely service"}
{"text":"I ordered through the Yelp delivery service and I had my fingers crossed that the Sushi would be good. It was fabulous! I'm picky about my seafood since I used to live in the Bay Area and know what fresh good sushi should taste like. 

Everything was tasty and the Tuna was nice and firm just the way I like it. I will be ordering from this place again for sure. It's #3 on my list with Spicy Tuna being #2 and Osaka being at the top.

Try this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It is not to my liking to write reviews. The service here was very good. 

The food on the other hand failed tremendously. The sushi lacked flavor being bland, also, the sushi was packed with enough rice to feed a whole family. I usually look at the pictures before i go to a new place and boy were they deceiving.

The rolls were extremely large and also lacked flavor. I did like the Sex Bomb!

The jalapeño poppers needed more cream cheese. I was clueless as for what to ask for to add flavor to my food.

It was lunchtime and the place was empty. This should have been my cue to keep moving. 

Hopefully someone pays attention to the constructive criticism before it becomes a vacant restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awful!! I ordered on Yelp's Eat24 app at 8:42 pm. The estimated delivery time was 45-60 minutes. My food didn't arrive until 10:40 - almost two hours later. The delivery driver didn't speak English, his phone died, and the manager said she couldn't help him with directions because she was at home. It was a mess and completely ruined my Friday night plans - as I was on the phone on and off for over 35 minutes! Once the sushi finally came, I was even more disappointed. The sushi was soggy and tasted old, like it had been sitting out for days. This is truly a disappointment! Never again!!"}
{"text":"WOW!! A hidden gem! Honestly one of the best Sushi Restaurants in Henderson!! Service Amazing, Menu Amazing, Atmosphere Amazing! Fresh fish , lots of variety check this place out! This is the only place we go to now in Henderson!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since this restaurant had a change of name & management I have been exceptionally disappointed in the menu, in restaurant service & quality of the food... Too bad! We REALLY enjoyed everything BEFORE the new management took over!"}
{"text":"Accidentally stumbled upon a sushi gem! Kay is so funny and sweet! She gave us so much attention and was so helpfully. We ate the apple special that chef Sean made. He's very artistic and he created the 911 special! This place is hip magical and amazing! A must try and try again!"}
{"text":"So,  we've come back here four Fridays in a row. I guess we're becoming regulars and for good reason. The food is amazing. The staff is attentive and courteous and the owner Julianna is a jewel.  There are so many excellent dishes to choose from,  we haven't been disappointed yet.  It's in a quiet strip mall in Anthem, worth a short drive if you don't live close.  I'm sure we'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fantastic food and Great atmosphere. Hidden gem!!! Owner went out of her way to make us feel welcome. The orange for dessert was the best tasting orange I've ever had. Must try."}
{"text":"This place has changed hands (formerly En Sushi & Robata Grill) but it consistently delivers very good Japanese food. The service has gotten better and the chefs are really friendly. If you are in the area, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant!!! Amazing service and phenomenal sushi, I'll definitely be back. 

We ordered the burning tuna roll, dragon roll, rainbow roll, salmon lover, toro belly nigiri and the chef gave us a complimentary jalapeño popper and delicious orange creamsicle dessert. Great music and wonderfully clean too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service..excellent food..Choi made us some great rolls..Juan kept us hydrated and made room for all of our rolls..and Juliana made us feel at home. The sushi was amazing and fresh.. will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Price seemed a little steep for lunch AYCE($27) but average for dinner($27). They have one AYCE price all day. Interior is well designed and clean. No kids menu and no kids drinks such as apple juice, but they tried very hard to please us and kids. Oldest kid got teriyaki chicken bowl and it came with miso soup and a salad as a lunch special. Youngest just got a bowl of rice. Wife and I did all you can eat sushi. The tolls were very yummy, quality stuff. We made the mistake of ordering all fried or baked rolls though without know and because they only do full roll orders and no half we got stuffed very quickly before we could try anything else.... the food quality from what we had was very good though. We will be back again for sure since we now live in area!"}
{"text":"The chef in this restaurant is the best sushi chef in the world :)  I went Sai sushi many times after renovation, Sai sushi has never let me down, ever! Fresh fish, extensive appetizer menu and delicious \"homemade\" dessert! Sai sushi is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food fresh sushi! Super cute inside. Clean vey modern and even better it's right in my backyard! Julianna the owner and Ryan the sushi chef were just amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this local sushi restaurant.  They just added a daily happy hour from 3-6, 20% off of everything including alcohol.  The owner is delightful and has a heart of gold.  The fish is fresh.. Yum.  They are only open for dinner starting at 3, until the Fall they will resume lunch . closed Mondays."}
{"text":"This review was difficult.  There is a lot to like about this place but also a lot that could use improvement. New owners at this location so maybe changes are still being made. I will note though that the regular sushi chef was out today and the person who was in his place, although very competent at making sushi, had absolutely no clue about the menu and policies of the restaurant which made for a difficult experience.  

We arrived and sat at the bar.  The place was empty when we got there and about 1/3 filled when we left.

This is an a la carte restaurant, not AYCE. 
The first thing that struck me was the limited sushi menu.  They have about a page and a half of special rolls and a small column of basic sushi, an even smaller column of nigiri/sashimi and a handful of cooked items.  Even their udon and non-sushi items are limited.

My 10 year old daughter ordered dumplings and California rolls.  She normally finds something more adventurous on the menu but could not here.  I ordered the Vegas Roll and the Earthquake.  

Service was slow, maybe because the sushi chef was not familiar with the recipes for the sushi and was looking at a cheat sheet.

One major plus was the complimentary edamame we got while we waited. It appears that is a regular thing here and it kept us from being crabby about the wait.

The california rolls were delivered quickly and my daughter ate two rolls and the dumplings before I received my first order.  

Up to now, the review is not a promising one but once the food arrived I am happy to say it was excellent.  The flavors and presentation were on par with some of the better sushi places around town.  I was glad to see full size scallops on the earthquake rather than the little bay scallops.

The owner served us our drinks and cleared our plates and was very friendly.  I think this place needs to experiment a little and let the sushi chef have some special creations.  I will definitely return to see how things are when the head chef is there.

Price is reasonable for non-AYCE sushi.  Expect 2-4 rolls for about $40.00 depending on what you get.  Basic sushi ranges from 5-6 dollars and special rolls from 10-16."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. There was one sushi chef. We were one of only 3 tables and it took an insanely long time. The fish was just OK. Tuna was not very fresh. They were very very nice though."}
{"text":"For the lunch crowd, I believe Sai Sushi is giving \"I Love Sushi,\" just less than a mile North a run for their money.  This recently opened Japanese Sushi restaurant with a full Sushi bar, intimate and family friendly atmosphere is exactly what the South Henderson, Anthem community needs.  Don't be fooled by the strip mall appearance or entrance: once inside it's décor is a small snapshot of everything that is modern in Japan.  Only thing missing: floor seating and table remote controls for ordering (commonly seen in Tokyo, Japan.)  

Not sure of the Sushi chef's history or reputation, but nevertheless, it sits fine with us.  My favorite specialty rolls are, incidentally called the \"89052\" (my zip code) and the \"7 Hills.\"  Not a coincidence, I love spicy tuna rolls and both of these are indeed, spicy tuna. 

The \"7 Hills\" is soft shell crab, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado wrapped with rice paper, eel sauce, yum yum sauce (not making that up) and sweet chili sauce.  

The \"89052\" is shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber topped with spicy tuna, white fish tempura, eel sauce and a white sauce.  

The service is very good, prompt, and respectful.  Food is made fresh-to-order so anticipate a wait.   Alcohol selection is good: you need that Kirin or Sapporo beer to go with that Sushi.  And for the kiddos, they have the specialty fave drink: Shirakiku carbonated ramune drink.  If you don't know how to open it, Youtube it, it is FUN!  

Don't forget that homemade ice cream for your desert; it's plentiful and deliciously creamy."}
