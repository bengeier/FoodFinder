{"text":"Terrific first impression of the place as it's surprisingly quite a bit larger and nicer than I'd expect a 'deli' to be. It has a relatively narrow entrance, but the space goes back pretty deep.  I really wanted just something to snack on. The menu is very much a diner, with familiar all-day breakfast offerings, along with sandwiches, burgers and the like.  I went with the fried chicken burger - no sides. It was clearly made from a factory-produced, frozen patty. Basically just 2 stars for that.  But as mentioned before, it's a really nice space and the service was really nice. I wouldn't mind trying their breakfast too. It could be a decent place for those looking for a typical, no-frills diner-style meal. I just hope the other items have a little more 'love' put into them than the chicken burger."}
{"text":"Best toasted western sandwich ever. The sweetest staff. Food is great, fresh and super healthy choices are always great. Huge menu and our go to spot for brunch. We've tried lots of different things on their menu and have never been disappointed. The decor is classic and stylish, you can come with a group or just on your own. Love the classic sandwiches...but definitely try their chicken and waffles with the mango slaw!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but it sucked.  The \"homemade soup\" was Mr.Noodles and  pieces of pre cooked chicken. Gross.  The table cloth was dirty, service was slow and the weird quietness was just strange.  On a positive note, the Montreal smoked meat sandwich was decent."}
{"text":"Corn beef hash: 2.5 stars Generic breakfast order: 3.5 stars  (details below)  My boyfriend ordered the corn beef hash (his favorite breakfast meal). His verdict: meh, I've had better. I tried a bit and I agree with him. In fact, I felt like something was off about it...it had this real processed feel about it. It came with home fries and an egg.  I got one of their generic breakfast offerings. It was 2 eggs, I choose 2 sausages over bacon, home fries, and I wanted French toast instead of the regular toast. Sorry about the picture caption, I thought I was getting one slice for $2.99 but it turned out that I got 2 for $3.98 (see receipt pic). Everything was pretty good and the home fries were my favorite. Nice and crispy. French toast was not bad with the icing sugar and syrup on the side. Gave it half a star more because the prices here are pretty good compared to chain breakfast places, and portions are decent.  Ambiance: 4 stars Clean, spacious, and comfortable diner with nice booth seating in a semi circle. Diner food in less glamorous Caf√© Mirage-channeled decor. I think this place was renovated recently. A couple came in asking if this was still the same deli place because they remembered it being much smaller.   Service: 3 stars There was just one waitress serving the entire place but it wasn't very busy. She was friendly and polite but it would have been nice of her to offer us some water after we were seated."}
