{"text":"I live right around the corner from this location and I have been here several times since they reopened. They had been closed for more than a year and I honestly didn't think they were going to come back again, but I'm really glad they did. 

From what I understand the owner sold this place & now he bought it back and it seems much improved since their reopening. I had been here once with my gf prior to their remodeling and everything seems much improved. 

I can only comment on the bar area and I've never dined in for dinner, which is why I only can give 4 stars. I'm looking forward to eating dinner there one of these nights but I usually just go into the bar to have drinks, eat small apps and play video keno. 

They are open 24/7 and i usually go in during the swing shift or late night. I've always had a really great time and the bartenders are really fun and personable which makes me feel happy about going here. I've tried their clams with both white and red sauce as well as the tiramisu. I love everything I've had so far--the food is very flavorful which is the way I like it. The broth for the clams is very savory and garlicly which is the way I love my food to taste. The tiramisu was sweet, but not overly so with a strong espresso & cocoa flavor...just the way i love it. 

The thing that keeps me coming back is the service. The people who work here are very down to earth and easy going which is important to me and keeps me coming back. 

They have a very interesting set up also where the bar is completely enclosed and the dining room seating is around it. I suppose this makes it possible for smokers to smoke in the bar area without disturbing the diners. I'm not a regular smoker so this isn't a big deal for me but I guess it allows smokers to be comfortable in the bar without disturbing the diners. 

I will update again once I go in for a complete dinner. I have a feeling I will be happy and will be able to add another star for a total of 5 stars. 

If you live around here and have been thinking about going in, give them a try. I am a big fan. I can even walk home!"}
{"text":"Went here last night. For a Sunday night had to wait a very long time for pizza. Not just the normal wait, but more like over 30 minutes for a simple pizza. Food & service was subpar. Nothing memorable. I don't even remember servers name & I just ate there last night. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went on a weeknight with my sister, her husband and my nephew. There were only two other tables of two going. 

Service was awful, waited about 10 minutes until someone actually took the drink order. 

When I ordered, I got the meatball sub where the meatballs are so big, you cant eat it with your hands, you have to use a fork and knife. Well, when i came out, it was a full loaf of bread with 4 meats that weren't much bigger than a golf ball. They put so much sauce on it, the bread was soggy and the meatballs were undercooked. 

I would give them a 1, but the waitress didn't mind putting juice in my nephews bottle and the chicken fingers were good. 

I may have picked a bad day to go, but I think service and quality of food should be great Monday thru Sunday."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon - 1 waitress (Kari) in entire restaurant.  She had 4 tables. So why was she nowhere to be seen?  Why were other tables wondering the same?  Why do I have to ask for a 2nd cup of coffee as she's bringing the check?  Were they so short-staffed that she was in the kitchen cooking?  Who knows?

Personality of a wet noodle:  Obnoxious \"You guys\" in every sentence, no greeting us either coming into or leaving restaurant, didn't come back to check table to see if we needed anything, doesn't say anything to us other than the bare minimum, didn't offer dessert...  I could go on and on.  She was like a robot.  Hope she doesn't last long there."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just have one of those late nights where all you can think about before going to sleep is pizza. Carmine's Little Italy (also known as Instant Replay) is the late night spot for pizza. Big Mike is always behind the bar, and offering pitchers of cold beer, but the pizza is the highlight here. There used to be a great late night special on pies for around $3.00 (owners, if you are reading this, please bring it back!!) but the prices are still very reasonable. Only the bar area is open late at night, but it is surrounded by gigantic, borderline obnoxiously big televisions playing all sorts of things. I watch the music channels while my boyfriend catches up on the sports stats (God forbid he doesn't know what happened in ever sporting event that day). Big Mike is always chatty, especially with the ladies, and I always have a fun time talking up a storm with him. The restaurant part is open during the day for lunch and dinner, and it is decent Italian for a quick bite. I have never seen the bar too packed, but there is always about twenty people around 2:00am. Everyone seems to be here for the same thing; pizza and pitchers. Carmine's Little Italy is located right behind the Sunset Station, so if you are ever in the area at that time of the morning (night?) check out the pizzas, and say hello to Mike!

Recommended drink: Big Mike WILL give you a pitcher of beer whether you want it or not.

Recommended eats: Pizza, of course!!"}
{"text":"I was waiting 'til we got back home to CA to draft this review, and found that Louie D had pretty much said it for me.  The only things I'd add are to try the Lasagna, which is about as comforting as it can possibly be, the Pizza, which is a true traditional treat, and the Cheesecake, which is creamy and rich and . . . if you're too full to have it after your meal, ask them to pack it up for you to-go!"}
{"text":"We have been enjoying the food and service at Carmine's for years.  Carmine's has been apart of many landmark family celebrations. But...last night they dropped the ball. The service was awful.  I don't know what happened to the wait staff since we were there last.  The staff was very young and very inexperienced.  The food was fine but no one checked on us, asked if we needed anything, or offered us desert.  It was not what we were use to."}
{"text":"N0 pasta after 10pm. This place has become a joke. Scrap this stupid graveyard menu that starts @ 10. The owner here is clearly incompetent. Hello guiseppes, right down the block and a full menu... Always. Better food too."}
{"text":"Food Was Absolutely Amazing! Staff was very nice and attentive. Loved the bar and lounge area, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"carmines is a pretty cool place.  my bf and i usually go there late at night when we feel like having a beer.  it's fun on sundays when the bar is full.  

the food is pretty good...nothing really jumps out as amazing though.  but it's definitely somewhere that you and your friends will be able to find something for everyone."}
{"text":"The alfredo sauce is not the same as my first review :( won't be going back. sorry to say."}
{"text":"I am in agreement with Kathy S. Here are a few reasons why we decided to just go elsewhere last night.
They must figure out how to adjust the vents.Who wants to eat hot food while having cold air blow down on the table and you? Although there was a door between the restaurant and the smoke filled bar the servers went in and out of the door and it remained partly opened which caused the smell of cigarette smoke to escape into the dining area. That was enough to chase us out. I sincerely hope management figures it out."}
{"text":"This place is great and for sure a family favorite. Always good food and even greater service. They start you off with oil, vinaiger and bread and go to a full menu of pasta, salads and our favorite... WINGS!! Las Vegas owned and we love them!"}
{"text":"Im glad to see the place is back, but its not 100% the same, Penne Alla Vodka and philly cheesesteaks arent on the menu anymore. The bread sandwich rolls are different from before, the pizza doesn't taste like oldskool villa pizza anymore! I wish they served big pizzas as well I'd carry out from them and come by more often if they did. The fried mozzarella, and pastas overall are still as good as they used to be! The service, well? what do you expect when the vento family is running it, its excellent!"}
{"text":"I love the friendly staff! It's a great environment with good food and easy on your wallet! I'd recommend some wings!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  My traditional Stromboli was really good. The portions were big. But dessert was the best part.  For dessert we had Zeppoles with ice cream!  It was delicious.  Zeppoles are like little donuts and they're brought to the table freshly fried.  light crisp on the outside but soft on the inside.  Yum

My friend suggested having a double espresso (which was good) with some lemon peals.  I thought she was nuts but I tried it anyways and it was surprisingly good!  The aroma of the lemon with the espresso made me my mind think that I was having a lemon pound cake with my espresso.  Try it sometime... it's pretty crazy.

Overall experience was better than good.  I would love to go back for the Zeppoles!
I forgot to mention that there a ton of TVs but they are up high so they are not too much of a distraction for those who are not there to watch sports."}
{"text":"We just had got done moving in to our new home in Henderson and were looking for some greasy bar food.  We couldn't really come to agreement especially because most pubs don't cater to 3 young children.  So, my husband chose Carmines because he had worked with the owner to sell him a car.  When we walked in, I was immediately impressed.  Very clean and lit better than most Italian eateries.  Service was friendly.  A good selection on the menu and seemed pretty affordable especially compared to most chains.  My husband and I both had calzones.  The calzones usually come with cheese, ham, and pepperoni but they were very good about putting in jalapenos for him instead of ham.  They were soooo amazing!  Cooked well and not crazy greasy but very flavorful.  Kids seemed to like children's pizza and chicken strips.  Husband and I ordered a couple heifenweizens and they were delicious.  Definitely will be a go to place now that we live in town!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4/5. This place is a bar but the restaurant is seperate which means no inhaling of smoke while I eat my food. YAY! 

I love Italian Food but for some reason I resort to Olive Garden everytime because the food tastes great and service is always on point. However now that I found this place, I'm going to keep coming back. 

I had a simple dish, egg plant parmesan sandwich with a cesar salad. It was good! The menu has a wide variety of food to choose from. They have lunch specials, and happy hour. I have heard that they do have good pies too! 

Family owned, good service, great prices, and good bites... Don't knock it till you try it!"}
{"text":"Terrible to no décor, very dark and this was at 5:45 pm for a family dinner. We ordered 2 large pizzas and a calzone. Food was very average, no reason to return. Have been to many of Carmines restaurants but will stick with Ventanos for nice décor, quality food and fair prices."}
{"text":"This was our first time after hearing that the food was good. This is also our last time. The waiter actually lied to us and I caught him and he knows I caught him! Everything was fine. Food was pretty good and my party and I even discussed coming back because we thought the food was good. While waiting for our food we asked for more bread. Alfredo, our waiter barely acknowledged our request but we knew he heard us. We waited and the bread never came. Our food arrives and we ask for the bread again. He barely acknowledges us again. Still no bread. We're almost done eating. Alfredo comes and says bread is being freshly made and will be about 10 minutes. We say fine. A few minutes later I catch Alfredo surreptitiously, rushing by with a basket of bread to another table! Unbelievable! Then he comes back to our table, without bread, mind you, and asks if we need anything else. I ask what the deal with the bread is and he says, of course, he'll bring it right away! I say never mind, just bring the check... I did call the GM to make her aware of what happened but we will never be going back there. Again, food was good. If you want decent food with bad service, then check it out. Your choice."}
{"text":"I was happy to hear to see that this bar/Italian restaurant had re-opened recently. So I decided to check it out. 

The service was excellent. The food prices were average. The portions were decent sized but the food was good. I ordered the lasagna and it meaty and just enough cheese and sauce, It wasn't busy in there, and the waitress was chatty and it didn't mind at all.

Afterwards I decided to go down to the bar and have a couple of drinks and watch a baseball game. the bartender was friendly and we were talking about different teams. Overall I would go back there again!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review of Carmines because it has re-opened under the original owner and I believe they are starting to redeem themselves. I went to have breakfast there a few days back and the place is completely redone inside. The tables have all new settings, new menus, cleaner, brighter, everything is just plain better. One major advancement, no more gross armpit smell from the corner of the booth. The food is great like typical Carmines food used to be! I heard Carmine booted the old owners,the franchisees and took his place back over. He has a little article about how he franchised his places and the new owners ran a few of them into the ground and it killed him to watch his restaurants turn to crap. I commend him for taking pride in his place and making it what it used to be. Now to the important stuff....

I have not been there for dinner yet as of this review only breakfast and lunch. You can't beat the breakfast. It's nothing spectacular but it's a $2.99 and you and a buddy can get out for under $12 bucks! It's really a good deal and it's not half bad. The service has gotten ten times better, I think Carmine got rid of all the old crappy servers and now has some family in there running the show so they are pretty much on top of things. I have not had a problem so far with the service at all. Lunch was good, I had some wings which were great. Done just right and not over cooked. Good job on transforming Carmine's Little Italy back into a cool local spot to get some good grub and watch a game.  I have not been into the bar area of yet but if it is anything like the restaurant  I am sure it's great. Once again good job Carmine, you have an old customer coming back."}
{"text":"Good food, good bar! The bartenders make the place great. Nikki is awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch and sat at the bar. I wasn't smoky at all, which is nice and the bartender, Keely was very nice, though busy, there was a huge crowd in the restaurant for some special event. We had the Shrimp Scampi pizza and it was awesome! There was plenty of shrimp and the garlic butter sauce was so good. We were playing VP and talking so we didn't notice how long it took, but I still had a quarter of my beer when it came. so it wasn't too long at all. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly and attentive. The food was outstanding! The garlic knots were delish and the marinara was superb! My guy had the chicken parm and loved it. I had the rigatoni with the peas, mushrooms, sautéed onions, dash of fresh basil and their yummy pink sauce w chicken instead of the ham it usually comes with. I wasn't really expecting much. Just wanted to try some place new. Wow was this a great surprise!
******update********
Went back and the service was terrible. The waitress was unfamiliar with the menu. She kept forgetting things like what we ordered to drink and to bring another fork. The food took a really long time to come out. There was no hostess so we stood there waiting to b seated about 5 min. The food was pretty good (had the same pasta dish as last time) but my chicken was hard and not seasoned. My guys pizza was good but was supposed to have garlic on it and we tasted no trace of garlic. Overall I had to take away two stars for those reasons."}
{"text":"Drove by the place several times since they opened and finally had a reason to go... Easter with the family.  (The Pope is Italian, right?) Anyhow, we walked in and were greeted rather promptly.  Wish there was just a little more lighting at the big tables in front for our party of 8. The open atmosphere helps a bit. The waitress did a great job but I must say that it wasn't busy. Does seem they recently hired additional staff.

I had high hopes on the garlic knots that I had heard about. They were a bit smaller than a golf ball and marinara didn't stick to it well (and we weren't going to double dip) and hard on the exterior.  Not overly impressed with the mozzarella sticks but each shared one issue that I had...the marinara.  It came across under seasoned to me but a few people were OK with it.

Carmine's redeemed itself with their terrific chopped salads. The chicken alfredo was spot on and not overwhelmed by grease (or overzealous use of the olive oil.) The lasagna was a good portion but suffered a little from the very thin marinara mentioned before which created a pink pool around the plate. Yet, that same sauce worked well on a chicken parmesan sandwich. The pizza was a winner as well with a good crust, good topping to cheese to sauce ratio. The full chicken parmesan was more than one of our party could finish.

I wish the rating system would allow us to give them 3.5 stars but it isn't entirely at a 4 quite yet. I know that they will get there as they have a good foundation. Why do I believe that? Because, I can see myself heading back in a few months but probably for that alfredo."}
{"text":"We waited for this place to open for quite awhile, and it was well worth the wait.  Great service, delicious food, nice menu items.  They have excellent happy hour specials. It's quiet and comfortable. The chicken parm is tasty, and portions are not over the top. I can't wait to try some dessert. The spumoni cake looks yummy."}
{"text":"This place was terrible...I hope it re-opens as something totally different (if it ever does re-open).  I had the stromboli and my brother had the chicken cacciatore...both were totally bland and uninspiring.  The restaurant was nearly empty..I think we were literally just starving and that's why we didn't leave when we saw the signs...terrible ambiance..."}
{"text":"Great local bar.  Food is good, I grew up working for an Italian restaurant so my sauce tastes are different but I've had great meatball hoagies, patty melts and more here.  Gambling is good here as well.  They have an inside bar sealed off by glass (for smoking) and a sizable dining room that surrounds the whole bar.  The bartenders are beautiful and friendly, you're guaranteed to feel comfortable here.  They also have TV's in every direction so if there's a game you're looking for it will be on one of them I'm sure."}
{"text":"Gross.  I was here with coworkers and we should have known it wasnt going to be good by the name.  I ordered the Chopped salad and the sausage pizza.  The salad was fair but the pizza a terrible.  The service was good from Eddy"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. This is my second visit and both had waiters far better than average. Great food, fair price"}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about Carmine's Little Italy.  Like most places in Vegas, the architecture of the restaurant is strip mall inspired, which can make it less than inviting.  But once you do go in, you won't be disappointed.

The place is huge.  The centerpiece is the bar with h-d screens surrounding it from the top.  The bartenders are fast and friendly.  They'll bring your food right to the bar or you can grab a table in the huge dining area.  For smokers, there's plenty of patio space to come and go as you please.

I didn't eat much when I visited.  I had the fried mozzarella.  Most places you'd expect the puny sticks a la TGI Friday's.  But what you get for a similar price are three or four substantial diagonal shaped fried mozzarella pieces with plenty of marinara.  It's just one of those little things that make you say hey, that's cool.  The menu is extensive and the server I had was really busting his butt and friendly.  I left a good tip.

If you're thinking of a night with a big group to see a game or just to get together and enjoy each other's company, go to Carmine's.  It's located near the US 95 freeway for easy access.  I need to go back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in during their Grand Opening on 4/24/14. Was surprised to see not many people there. Normally the words grand opening, specials, etc get people in like crazy. Sat in the bar area since we really were just their for happy hour. Also ordered the cheese pizza they had on special for the grand opening. I do have to say it was pretty decent & I am not a cheese pizza person (I like my toppings!) Can't wait until the patio upstairs opens up. Used to come to this place back when it was Half Shell. Their normally happy hour specials look pretty good so I'll be returning. Bartenders gave great service - I was surprised because as so many of us Las Vegans know service in this town stinks! But Gram (sp) & other female bartender were great & always keeping track if we needed anything."}
{"text":"I dont know why but it depends on the cook in the back whether the food is good or not. Got an eggplant parm sandwich (no taste!) and a turkey sandwich. Also have had the stromboli. Very tasty but I had to go home and heat it because the middle was cold! The marinara is give or take..."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Couldn't get a players card, player system was down. First tap beer requested was out. Said they had Tuaca, then out.  Did not try the food. Geez."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch...hardly anyone in the place. Ask the waitress if she think we'd beable to get in and out and she replied yes. Placed our order  but it took almost 30 minutes. Finally our food comes out. I had the meatball sandwich and salad. It hardly had any sauce which was so light in color as if they ran out of tomatoes or something. Anyway I tasted a piece of the meatball and it was flavorless and mushy. I poured extra sauce hoping I could get pass the mushiness but I couldn't take a 3rd bite of that rolled up ball of pate. Tried the salad and it was wiltered. I couldn't eat any of it. Disappointed as I was so hungry. The other table of  customers had to get up to find the server as well as we did but instead got the busboy. In turn I told him the meatballs were mushy and the lettuce was wiltered...he did nothing but argue with me as if that would make it better. Wtf...this place is terrible now and it was just as bad before they were shut down.  No more chances at carmines. I should've went to subway for a $2 meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"Always wonderful food at a reasonable price. Graveyard is preferable with my schedule, and Cory is the best bartender I've come across. A+"}
{"text":"They're CLOSED! Permanently!!  Phone is disconnected. Signs are all down. 

I am assuming that this location is no longer open for business. 

Never got a chance to give them a try. 

I can't understand the turnover. There is ample parking. Apparently location isn't everything."}
{"text":"I know this place is a neighborhood comfy-food kind of place, as evidenced by the seniors who frequent this place.  But for a Saturday evening, not a lot of diners.  The employees were really nice, which is why I'm giving 3 stars, but if you're a bonafide \"foodie\", you know there's much better Italian food to be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"UPDATE!! We stopped in for Breakfast and it was as good as dinner and take out :)

The server was very friendly, helpful and personable. We loved her. 
The meal was delivered quickly and was fantastic... Italian Omelet with sausage and red sauce. Really good. We just cannot get enough of Carmine's.

Please keep it up folks!!"}
{"text":"I came here because its very close to my work, and I had heard an ad for it on the radio claiming, \"grandmothers Italian cooking,\" or something along the lines of that.  When I pulled up I remember thinking to myself, \"Geez, I hope this isn't incredibly over-priced crappy bar food.\"

It was.

Walking inside all I could hear was the announcements of a horse race, and a commercial for Prostate disorder...yumm!!

After seating us, our waiter introduced himself as Alfredo.

Immediately I looked on the menu for Fettuccine Alfredo, his name made me crave it, lol.  Was it on there? Nope. I went in hoping to get some kind of yummy Italian dish, but after looking at the menu I could tell it wasn't going to happen. 

My dear friend and I decided that nothing really caught our eye, and decided to just split the vegetarian pizza.  It was bland, and the artichoke hearts tasted horrible, I gagged on a bite of them. I gagged on a $10.00 individual pizza. For the service and the quality of the food, $10.00 should have been the price for 2 meals. Ugh, I will not be returning.

Heres what it comes down to: crappy decor, crappy atmosphere, (unless you like to watch and listen to nothing but sports, which is understandable since it is a bar) crappy service, crappy pizza, crappy prices. Crappy lunch. :/."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian place (since Mama Jo's went under). The food is excellent, and the evening we were there the service was as well. They have great specials on Mondays and Tuesdays that help you stretch your budget, and they also have coupons on Restaurant.com."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy eating here. No noise of slot machines ringing in our ears was a welcome sound. The food is tasteful and the service is good. My wife like the Calzones, but just make sure you ask for a lot of cheese and you'll get it. I enjoyed the Salmon and Fettuccini, it all was good. It came with one side salad and bread. We shared the salad. We had water with lemon to drink. The overall meal cost $31.23 plus tip."}
{"text":"Came in late because there is no other 24 hour Italian place I know of. I had the fettucini alfredo with chicken, house salad, and an iced tea for about 25 bucks. Not a bad deal, not the best one either. The sauce could have been cheesier, the chicken, more flavorful. In fact, my buddy claims it's canned and microwaved chicken; i'd say i dont have enough evidence to say for sure. Hey, Italy's got cans and microwaves anyhow, right?

I've also had the chicken Carmine here before, not too shabby either. A nice pasta dish that is a change up from standard cream or marinara sauce.

If you're coming in late, you'll have to sit at the bar which is not a good idea if you are allergic to cigarette smoke or wannabe experts in surfing/karate. I've been in the dining room before, the service is polite, although slow if it's late.

My meals here are never particularly memorable, not necessarily a bad thing."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful Bui I always find the place so hot.  You have to try the seafood cioppino and the stone shrimp.  The staff is very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever ate! Everything is homemade and the service is impeccable!! They have both a dining room and bar. WAY better then the previous venues at this locations- you can tell the owners care about their service and quality I food. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I always get pizza and it's really really good. Great size for one. The place is kinda awkward but the food is good and that's most important. Always have had a pleasant experience. Will return!"}
{"text":"They re-opened this location about 3mos ago.  They have now enclosed the bar area with plexiglass (for a smoking section, I assume).  I had the lasagna and their house red wine.  The food was average, the wine great for $3 and being out of a box.  Service was good.  Overall it's a decent sports bar establishment with higher price-points on their food but decent happy hour drink pricing.  The wine list is fairly extensive for this type of establishment.  Brew selection was below-average for a sports bar."}
{"text":"I'm with Mark.  The best pizza in town.  Best that I've had anyway.  It's like New York City pie.  Big slices, foldable, but actually better.  Carmine's has better pizza than my favorite place in Queens.  If you can't trust a fat man's opinion on pizza, who can you trust??  Beer selection is pretty good. They had a lovely Brooklyn amber ale on tap and a few tasty treats.  Maureen the barkeeper is a real beauty and even nicer and more professional than you can imagine.  I just love this place and hope that they can make a go of it in this location.  I'm rooting for them and will be a regular.  Oh, and the video poker machines are pretty loose.  :)"}
{"text":"Awwww shucks. The $2.99 breakfast special is no longer. The regular-priced breakfast IS still tasty, though. (I can't imagine that they weren't making money on the $2.50 coffee and $2.50 juice which usually gets ordered alongside the special. Oh well!)

Would like to stop in for dinner one of these days!"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here tonight. First time in here since it was Instant Replay. Had the pizza which was decent, everyone else agreed their meal was decent, what wasn't decent was the service. Our server took our order then wasn't to be found again until our meal was almost done. The runners were the ones bringing our food/drinks. Ordered apple juice for our two year old (which a runner had to come back and let us know they didn't have), then settled on OJ which came in a beer mug, glass, for our two year old....they had a kids menu, but apparently no kid-friendly cups. Since our server wasn't around I had to get up myself to get some condiments. We were brought our appetizer but no plates to eat it on. Service was shoddy. Food and prices weren't so great that we can simply overlook terrible service (our server later came by to ask if she could take the check so she could close out since she was tired and had been there since breakfast). Nice. Fail Carmine! Never again."}
{"text":"Buyer beware if your gambling at the bar and you're winning your drinks are not free. Plus I order dinner as well so what I'm saying is the server should warn you that the drinks are not free. I will never go back"}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting 3 stars instead of 2, is because I have a history here. I started coming here in 2005 when I worked around the corner. I remember THEN I could add avocado to my house salad, and the calamari looked like baby squids instead of Os. I stopped coming here for a while, then started again in the last 3-4 years since I started dating a foodie and exploring more. One of the first things I notice was no avocado. Clearly it had been gone a while when the waitress said they've never had it.  However I did find out about shrimp on a stone. A hot sizzling stone with shrimp and lemon. I fell in love. Then I fell harder when my waitress suggest I order it blackened/Cajun style. Almost every time I eat this, I hear the people around me say \"oooh what is that she ordered?\" A must at this restaurant that's what it is. 
I've ordered numerous entrees: chicken picatta, Greek salad, chicken salad sandwich, their specialty sandwich, wings, fingers, raviolis. I guess I'm just over it. Other than the shrimp, NOTHING amazes me. And it's not always consistent. I've had my Greek salad be wonderful, I've had it underdressed and bland. I've had picatta that was zesty and moist, then had it over cooked and dry. I WANT to like this place but when it comes down to it, it isn't good authentic Italian. 
Basically place your bets if you dine here. Will it be good? Maybe. Will it suck? Possibly. 
I want to note, I've never had bad service. Today while dining, the waitress seen we were drooling and brought us house bread ASAP. If these guys would spend a little bit more time training their cooks to be the same, and spent a little more moola on ingredients- they'd have me as a regular no doubt!"}
{"text":"Always a great environment and amazing food!! Shrimp Scampi Pizza, Wings, and Stromboli...Thank you, Amy (Bartender)!"}
{"text":"There is just something amiss here. All of the Carmine's locations had good food, as well as a good reputation, this one, not so.The staff just doesn't seem interested and after many years in the restaurant business, this location has an omen. This location lacks warmth and that down home feel and is due to architecture which could be overlooked if the stafff would show some interest in their guests. I will continue to go to Montesano's Deli. P.S. They played the most God aweful music, I love every kind of music, (excluding rap & hip hop) what they were playing was loud and complete shit music."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. My family and I have frequented it for years. When they closed to remodel we were sad but now they're back open and back under the original management which makes the place even more awesome. Service is great every time. Connie (one of the family owners/managers) is always checking on everything and on all the customers which I always enjoy seeing in any business 

Food is delicious, pasta is always cooked perfectly al dente. Greek salad is AMAZING, I don't know what they put in their dressing but yum. Shrimp on a stone appetizer, I've never seen anywhere else and it's tasty. They have a wide variety of options on their menu from bar food to Italian & they will make pretty much anything you want if it's possible. They have a good variety of beers (bottles & draft) which is great, plus plenty of TVs for game watching! There's really nothing to dislike about Carmine's."}
{"text":"I always try the breakfast deal and its great price and great service. even though one lady is always perfoming but she keep everything on the chart. Coffee is freshly brewed and Italian omlet is made with pfresh and tasty. $2.99 breakfast special is a steal."}
{"text":"This Place has re-opened by the original owners and the food is pretty good. THE AIR CONDITIONING HAS BEEN FIXED !!!!.  I spoke with the daughter of the Owner and she said the place was completely overhauled and menu revamped. The food was good and I will go back !!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible, we waited almost an hour  for a large pizza for lunch
when we placed our order we were the only customers there.

The pizza was $20.99 for large pepperoni and sausage.
It was disgusting, I could find a better pizza in any frozen section of any store.


I see no reason to ever go back 
giving 1 star was generous ...."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying if you go to Carmine's thinking your eating at a Mario Batali type establishment, well then sure you'll be disappointed.   if you go there however, thinking you're going to a casual, fun local bar with an Italian menu, I have no doubt you'll enjoy yourself.  

Carmines is an interesting juxtaposition of sports bar and restaurant.  I love sitting at the bar and grabbing a couple cool suds on a hot night and exploring their tasty and simple menu.  One of my absolute favorites is their greek salad.  Its nothing fancy but is chocked full of fresh veggies and tasty feta cheese.  If Im feeling a bit more ambitious, I'll sometimes venture over to sandwiches of which I really enjoy the eggplant parmigiana.  Its huge and topped with tasty marinara.  The fries are nothing amazing but always come hot and crisp, which for most restaurants is a challenge.  I also really enjoy their various pasta dishes.  The kitchen staff understands the concept of al dente and the portions are generous.  My only complaint is their pasta trends a little on the pricey side whereas I find the other sections of the menu (sandwiches, salads, pizzas) very reasonable.  

The bartenders and servers are always accommodating and as an added bonus the video poker machines at the bar seem to payout better than some other local places.  Overall, Carmine's is not reinventing italian food nor are they even claiming they have the best stuff in town.  What they do accomplish is simple, delicious Italian in a sports bar/restaurant concept that is usually dominated by the same ubiquitous fare like chicken fingers or wings.  

Im thrilled to have Carmines in the neighborhood.  Id probably be thrilled to have a Batali place in the neighborhood too, I just couldn't afford to pop in as much as I do at Carmines."}
{"text":"Ok, this is my issue with this place. Yesterday the wife and I went there for dinner, when we walked in the place was hot like a oven, this happen twice before, the waiter said it is because the a/c was getting fix, that was last year, well last night same thing, when we asked about the a/c he could not give us a answer. We sat outside where it was dark. The food is good, but if you are looking for being comfy when you are dinning forget it! Wait until the winter time to go."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Not impressed with the food. If you want better Italian, there are multiple other places in town worth a try in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love it here!!! Late night eats for the hubby & I !!! Great Happy hour specials !!!"}
{"text":"Drove to Carmine's today only to discover that they had closed.  Such a huge disappointment, as we loved the food."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The bartenders,and the atmosphere is great. My favorite is the seafood pizza."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  The air conditioner was blowing cold air on all the booths and it took 3 requests to have it adjusted.  Ordered the lasagna and guess what? At 5:30 pm during dinner service no lasagna.  Ordered the meatball sub and it was average.  Meatballs were over-processed with no homemade taste or texture. Ordered a beer and it was not chilled.   Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"This is a sports bar & grill. I missed the happy hour which had some really great deals on drinks. I came in the late evening and ordered a linguine dish and it was good. I'm giving it 4/5 stars because the service is AMAZING! It is family run and they are very nice and attentive. 

They custom made my father's dish just to his specifications. They give plenty of complementary bread and you don't even have to ask them to bring it out, they just do it. I found this strange, but in a good way, they're open 24/7. Wow."}
{"text":"I guess i will give them 3 stars.  came here for a work holiday party.  the appetizers were really good. i had the eggplant parmesan for my entree which was really good as well.  the pasta was mediocre.  the service was incredibly slow, granted i think the waitress was overwhelmed by our party of ~30. i asked 2 different waitresses 3 separate times (total) for a drink menu before i finally got it. then had to wait forever to order the drink.  when it finally came it was delicious, though. however, upon receiving my second drink, the waitress spilled it all over me.  she apologized and offered me club soda and a towel.  while i was cleaning myself up, at my seat, she took my plate! i was not done eating.  so by then i was very upset.

overall the food was pretty good, the drinks were good, and i think the service would probably be good if you are not with a large party. i would give them a second chance."}
{"text":"As hubby and I were debating what to have for dinner, our friend called to ask if we wanted to meet up at Carmine's. Her timing couldn't have been more perfect or the choice of grub. Just a few days before we tried going at night but after being served our drinks and placing our orders we were told that they realized they couldn't serve us because they had a cook not show up. Denied!

Upon entering Carmine's this visit we were seated right away. I wanted to start out with the \"Mozzarella Fritta\" priced at $7.95. When it arrived to our table it was obvious it had been cooked too long. I think it had potential to be tasty if it was cooked right. The sauce that came with it though was really good. 

I knew I wanted to have pizza so we ordered a \"1/2 Sausage & 1/2 Pepperoni Pizza\" priced at $9.45 and a \"Carmine's Special\" priced at $11.95. Both were good! Our friend ordered the \"Chicken Parmigiana\" priced at $14.95. She shared some of the chicken with me so I could try and I have to say that I would for sure order it. It had good flavor and lots of gooey cheese!  

I grew sort of frustrated when my drink stayed empty. One of the managers noticed my empty drink and that the others at my table needed theirs refilled too and quickly had drinks out to us. She then took the time to ask us how our meal went and seemed genuinely concerned for her customers and their happiness. The thing that stood out most was her passion for the food. I appreciate great food (who doesn't?!) but great service goes a long way too.

I almost forgot to check in on yelp and at the end of the meal I did and realized that with your first check on on yelp you get a free piece of \"Tiramisu\"! Score! I showed it to the server and asked if it was too late and he said it wasn't too late at all. Before I knew it there was a piece of tiramisu big enough for us to share.  It was very delicious. Now that I have tried this piece of heaven I will more then likely get it on future visits and ask for it wrapped to have for dessert.

Carmine's is open 24 hours and has a special late night menu."}
{"text":"I haven't gone to Carmines for over a year but it use to be one if my favorite Italian places.  Loved the shrimp on the stone and the chicken Marsala.  The shrimp pizza, caesar salad, and many other dishes there were also great.  Their kitchen opens 24/7"}
{"text":"Came here to watch football on a Sunday. The bar was packed and the service was excellent. The bar is in the center of a large room with the tvs on the walls. They are pretty far from the bar itself which making viewing discomforting. There is areas against the wall with couches but don't expect to see any of the games from here.  There are many other places to go that have a better atmosphere and better food. I have tried a few menu items at Carmine's but nothing is that outstanding."}
{"text":"Just to show that it isn't just me, as one DumbAss that sent me a message saying. This place was only open 3 months for a reason, charging way too much for Crap!"}
{"text":"Half price night you can eat alot of food. However the food is mediocre and the service is so so. The place  resembles a big sports bar with dinning off to the side.

Now for the food: My spaghetti was pretty bland, the veal was tough, the fries cold, the salads under dressed. The bread sticks were pretty good as was the hamburger and the pizza. The deserts were pretty good. I believe there were 6 of us and we got out the door for $107 tax and tip. 

So if price is your objective go mondays or wensdays for a good deal"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place.  A bit far from where I live in Henderson, but I'll stop by if I have the chance.  The place has a bar in the middle for all the sports fantatics, and for those who want to get drunk.  Then the tables our set up surrounding the bar, but it's hard for some tables to see the game going on because the Big Screen TV's are set up in the middle, and the ceiling kind of blocks your view from the TV's, but it's ok.  It's more about the food anyways if you feel like eating there because once you look at the menu, the choices sound so good that it's hard to choose right away.  The portions are big and the food tastes really good.  It's not usually busy either, and the service was good when i was there."}
{"text":"Ok, this is one of my favorite places in my neighborhood.  I live nearby, so it is very convenient.  Not only that, but the food is great too.  Some of my favorite dishes are below........

Breakfast - Frittatas.....they have several to choose from, they are all great.
Lunch/Dinner - the New York Stromboli, Cajun Chicken Wrap, Pizza, and Pasta w/Proscuitto.

With the number of big screen TVs in this place it is a great place to come and catch a Football game or playoff Basketball/World Series game while getting something to eat.  They offer personal speakers that you can have at your table so you can pick which game to listen to while dining."}
{"text":"they are now on horizon ridge and carnagie as carmines pizza kitchen as of last week. same great pizza, small 6 table store."}
{"text":"they have moved to horizon ridge and carnagie under carmines pizza kitchen. same great pizza in 6 table store."}
{"text":"Food is good! Smells a little smoky in the place put pizza is excellent and done just how you order it.  Family feel to the staff and they are very nice!"}
{"text":"While staying in Henderson for the week, we were getting a bit tired of the same restaurant foods; buffets, burgers, etc. Decided to try Carmine's and we were not disappointed! Service was awesome, prices were reasonable and the food was delicious!! The portion sizes were huge and none of us left hungry. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"i went to this restaurant after they reopen, and so close to my work. I was so impress with their service and the food taste far beyond the expectation. i think the chicken marcella was the best i had and my hubby had a stake marinerra. Also i had their cocktail that huge full bar inside. This place is so spasy and clean also great parking lot around the place. YOu must try this place with new ownership. Also, there bread is  made in house so tender and tasty with oil and vinegar."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, but they seem to have dropped the quality of their food dramatically since the new year and it really ruined the experience of dinning here.. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"This was our 1st time and this is as good as Nora's w/o the long line on Saturday night. 

I had the veal with potatoes (in a brown sauce) and my sig. other had Chicken/eggplant/prosciutto/Parm both were excellent.

Used to live in NYC and this was as good as I used to get there. 
Also good to keep vampires away (copious amounts of garlic), mmm."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is that there is a bar that is like a giant aquarium in this well lit, plain little restaurant. Apparently that is how restaurant/bars can get around the new Nevada smoking laws. It did seem that there were smokers in the aquarium, and we, in the restaurant, experienced no smoking related incidents.

The staff was chaotic. We had a group of 7 including a toddler. Not the easiest group ever to deal with but...not too bad for an experienced server. We had an inexperienced server, buffered by a busboy and the manager/owner. All together, they made the experience go from bad to not so bad.

They have a great selection of microbrew beers as well as corporate domestics. However, our waitress did not know what they were (for example she listed Stone Brewery as one of their beers, when asked what beer it was she had to check...for each of the microbrews on the list). There was also no list of beers. The poor girl had to read all the beers from a list she made herself. I felt kind of bad for her but, I did want a good beer. Ended up getting Lagunitas IPA, a fine beer and the price was not bad.

The wine had a similar issue. Which was odd, most Italian places make such a big deal about wine. Again there was no list. When asked what the wines were, the waitress said there was red and white. It felt like I was in the Southeast! Finally the manager realized, sort of, what was happening and explained that they were redoing their wine list and were featuring one red and one white from an extensive collection until they finalized their choices. We ended up with an excellent Chianti at a great price.

I have an entire list here on Yelp dedicated to  Chicken Parmigiana sandwiches. I ordered the meal, as I consider myself a connoisseur of them, and got a chicken parmigiana plate over pasta. I enjoy that meal also, so was fine with eating it. However, I did order a sandwich specifically. When I informed the manager of this she happily reapplied the charge for the sandwich instead of the pasta dish. In her place I would have dropped the meal entirely (6 meals, a bottle of wine, two deserts, beers and soft drinks would have been enough for a table0. However, her decision was fine also.

I would head back here, largely to see if there was any improvement  with time or to see how hanging out in the bar would be. Apparently they have football on Sundays so perhaps next season."}
{"text":"Don't use a credit card at this place.  The food was fine and the waitress was nice.  It was my fault for forgetting my credit card there after paying the bill. However, when I got it back the next morning someone at the restaurant had charged $800 of electronics equipment to it.  When I called the restaurant manager to let him know, I barely even got an apology.  The bank is taking care of the fraudulent charges, but Carmine's did not seem to care at all.  This was not our first visit to this restaurant, but if this is how little they value repeat customers, it was definitely our last.  You lost us Carmine's."}
{"text":"While not the best place for Italian food, there are few places better for those middle of the night pasta and pizza cravings. The food is comforting and the bartenders are friendly. Service can be slow sometimes, but I never go when they're fully staffed, so it's hard to expect perfection. Newcastle on draft is never bad either.

I recommend the Spinach Calzone and the Lobster Stuffed Ravioli. Whenever we order their massive plate of Zeppoli I have a hard time stopping when I know I should. The wife loves their free bread too of course."}
{"text":"2 of 3 items were not cooked properly. 
I used to eat here all the time, different owners i THINK.
Pastrami sandwich smelled rotten. I took 1 bite and just could not eat it (and I love pastrami). I did not want to complain as it was a business luncheon. The waitress did not ask to correct it, did not offer it to be removed from bill, she sent \"manager\" over who \"could not smell\" so he took it back to the cook. The manager came back and said it was fine. No offer to remove from bill, not I am sorry, no NOTHING!!!!!
My favorite  app from there is calamari.  My app was not cooked properly, it was really batter tasting and super rubbery.  
I cannot tell you how many times over the years I have had this at this restaurant- and loved it every time.
I can only say I will never go back there and never have any business luncheons there, nor will I recommend to anyone I work with at the automall.
I did get a touch of food poisoning from my 1 bite of sandwich, I did pay the 10..00 for that food poisoning, and that will never happen again.
NOT GOOD AT ALL!!!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE Carmines! 
This place has great food and friendly staff.
Plus they serve 24 hours a day! Love It!"}
{"text":"Nothing at this place was quite right from the moment we walked in. The waitstaff was more interested in gossiping then serving - they just stood around, awkwardly close so we could hear their conversations. 
We never got bread. Other tables had it but I guess we were deemed not worthy. The pasta fagioli soup had an ok broth but it lacked in everything else and it was lukewarm. No to mention a very small portion for 6.95. We ordered the chopped salad and I did not care for it. The  brought it out wrong the first time and had to re-make it. It was very blah and boring - all I really tasted was eggs. The pizza was very middle of the road - had the white pizza and added broccoli. The broccoli was actually cooked nicely - star of the meal! We decided to try the cannolis as they are well Yelped. It said they had chocolate chips mixed in the cannoli cream right on their menu. Well, we got some kind of candied orange rind in our cannolis...it was terrible. The cream was good, but with that nasty dried fruit mixed in, I couldn't eat any of it. I don't get why food would not be served as it is described on the menu. And this place just re-opened! They might want to shut down for a little while more til they get their shit together. Also, it was FREEZING!"}
{"text":"Service is always better with Leann, she always gets it right and the service is perfect. Servings are still huge and you need a togo bag."}
{"text":"I actually followed a bartender to find carmines when she left her last job.  I consider the staff my friends and they always have a fun and possitive attitude.  Caitlin is the bomb!  Their food is great too!  As i write this i am craving their shrimp on a stone.  I can hear the sizzle now thinking about it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Sunday afternoon dinner at Carmine's. Ordered the shrimp scampi pizza - was very yummy! Only drawback to it was the scampi sauce was a little thick. 

 Fairly reasonably priced. Service was very good! I think three different people came over to help out, refill drinks, give us to go boxes, etc. 

 Only 3 stars because the windows between the dining room and the bar were apparently being replaced and thus covered with plastic and not conducive to a terrific dining atmosphere, but otherwise would probably be 4 stars. Will be back sometime."}
{"text":"We''ve been sitting here at a table in the bar for 30 mins, 2:45 pm. Watched the bartender texting, gabbing, and hugging one of the customers.  She finally took our order.  Only 12 people here.  Seriously crappy service.  We use to love this place.  Would not recommend this now.  The food is still good though."}
{"text":"This is an update: yes another one. they recently reopened and believe it or not it is somewhat remodeled with the bar area closed off to the dining area. The restroom no longer smells like a the sewer collection center for the city of Henderson, 
I have to admit my bf wanted to go bk to this place so we did. We met for their HH and it was surprisingly really good. I was craving a margherita pizza but the only pizza half price during HH was cheese pizza. so we ordered the antipasto platter (which had one slice of mozzarella cheese, one basil leaf and one slice of tomato (among some prosciutto, zuccini, red peppers, olives, lettuce) and i tore up the basil leaf, chopped the one single slice of mozzarella cheese and the tomato and put it on there immediately so they'd kinda melt into the warm cheese pizza (the food came out pretty quickly I might add) and the rsult: we shared a antipasto salad and a small (impromptu margaherita pizza ) really good. 

the HH apps are 1/2 price minus anything w/ seafood- but they have $1.50 draf, #$2.50 imports, $3 wells and $3 house wines. This I like b/c when I go to stupid Sierra nevada across the way they dont even take your order if you dont have a \"pair\". this place is very improved. so far.... but they still dont have volume on for the tvs in the bar area which is dumb. this is where they will still lose customers to Buffalo Wild Wings.."}
{"text":"This was one of many, many pizza places I have tried in search of the best NY thin crust pizza in Vegas.My quest is adding up in research costs and weight gain! Carmine use to own Villa pizza which had pretty good pie so I had to try this place. Very nice restaurant...... clean, nice decor and Diane my server was really so nice and very attentive! Great service! Carmine owns Ventano's in Henderson which is a really nice place also with fresh baked bread and great food. So...... I ordered the pepperoni with fresh garlic pie as always to judge their pizza. After the pie cooled down I enjoyed it more...... Nice fresh garlic, good pepperoni, nice cheese, the sauce was not really present and the crust kinda lacked flavor but was fine. OVERALL I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VERY NICE RESTAURANT.  I'd have to say their pizza is one of the top 5 in Vegas for NY thin crust. I just wished they had more than one size...... it was about a 12\" personal size. I guess their other locations have multiple sizes. I only spotted one size, $7.95,  in the menu. IMHO the best THIN CRUST PEPPERONI AND FRESH GARLIC pie is made by BRIAN and Antonio  at New York Pizza and pasta on the North East corner of Sahara and Jones. Second place for just a cheese pizza would have to be Dom Demarco's.....3rd place so far is Broadway pizza and probably Carmine's. If you want a nice place to take a girl, Carmines will fit your needs and the pizza is fine. Onward I go in search of the best THIN CRUST ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGE WITH PEPPERONI AND FRESH GARLIC N.Y STYLE PIZZA."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood sports bar and res. Their specials are fantastic price wise. The food is of nice yummy, quality. The service is more of a 3, I can tell they need more help on the busy nights. 
The chopped salad and pollo milano are my favorites!!!"}
{"text":"$2.99 Breakfast Special: this is what I can vouch for! With the recent departure of Del Mar (RIP), we have been stumped as to where to grab breakfast. We got a hot lead that the breakfast at Carmine's was good and clearly cheap, so we decided to go for it. The spot is freshly remodeled, so the interior is spic and span, and we received friendly, prompt service. 

The $2.99 special comes with two eggs, toast, hashbrowns and two slices of toast. Granted, it isn't super fancy, but it was executed perfectly. I wanted my eggs scrambled soft. I hate egg bricks, but 9 times out of 10 that is what I receive when I order scrambled. Here, they delivered nice, soft eggs. The hashbrowns tasted fresh, and they weren't crisped to death. (I actually prefer my browns non-crisp.)  The bacon was fine, and toast is toast. I really liked the coffee, just a nice, well-brewed java. 

We tried to go back again today, but they stop serving breakfast at noon. Travesty. Guess I will have to eat breakfast with the bankers. 

Note: I haven't tried anything else, so if you go in for linguine and hate it, don't look at me!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Breakfast was yummy. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food has gone down hill since 2010. Not sure what happened."}
{"text":"This place was horrible!  The pizza was so bad I had to spit it out... I also ordered the chopped salad, not only was the salad chopped to nothing, the balsamic dressing was not good."}
{"text":"A nice, clean bar/pizza/Italian restaurant. It was completely dead when we went in there on a Tues night, just one rockabilly (with fake boobs of course) bartender/server working. We sat on a couple of couches in front of a cool coffee table that pops up so you don't have to bend down and eat your food (not that I minded). I got a PBR, which was served to me in a glass (not necessary) - PBR is more for guzzlin down on the cheap, not for tasting all the aromatic qualities, but hey we are in Vegas, so everything has to be fancified, even in Henderson. 

The main reason I gave Carmine's 4 stars instead of 3 was the entree. My spinach/mushroom calzone made with ricotta and mozzarella cheese tasted incredible. It wasn't HUGE; a place I go to in Atlanta makes them so big I always have leftovers even if I'm starving (and at 25% cheaper) bit this calzone was just damn tasty. It came with a saucer of marinara which I promptly added crushed red pepper to. Mmm! I think it was the dough and the ricotta that really did it and they didn't skimp on the fillings. Also, this place is 24 hours, which is always a plus. Woot. :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by Carmine's!  

It's not a fancy place by any means, but it's spacious and comfortable with huge booths and plenty of space between tables.  The restaurant and sports bar are separate so the smell of smoke isn't too bad. 

The service was good.  Not spectacular; not bad... but quick and good. 

The food was excellent!  We had ravioli and pasta with meat sauce and both were delicious.  The portions were large.  I enjoyed the garlic knots and the house salad, and went all out with the zeppoles for dessert!  I never would have thought of something so simple but delicious - zeppoles a la mode!  One of my favorite desserts ever!  

I knock a star off because it just seems a little pricey.  But I'll definitely be coming back for dinner and dessert again very soon."}
{"text":"Back in biz!  We missed the old Carmine's and are glad they are back.  The sporting decor is missing, and the bar is all closed up, but the food is good!

The fried calamari were big, crispy and the spicy tomato dipping sauce was good.  This was a great starter.  I then tried the penne putanesca.  It is served with penne pasta, anchovies, capers, onions, with a garlic and tomato sauce.  I added chicken to the dish and it was very tender.

Overall, a good meal, great service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hard to find good pizza in Vegas . We decided to try it. We went in for lunch. I had a small pie. On. The other hand my husband ordered pasta with garlic and oil. It took over an hour to get it. When the pasta came they forgot the garlic so he got pasta with oil. When we questioned it they then brought out a bowl of oil with burnt garlic. Metro pizza is still the best in Vegas. Place was empty and dark. Staff is not too. Smart. Save your money"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Italian food with an authentic Italian atmosphere, this place isn't for you.  However if you are looking for good Italian food at a decent price, then this place is great.  I've been here about 3 times and the service is always excellent and the food is always very yummy as well.  The portions are also good..  I hate going to Italian food restaurants that give you a small square of Lasagna or small bowl of pasta for 15 bucks.  This place wont look like much from the outside and has a very \"Vegas\" feel, but don't let that deter you from trying a lunch or dinner from this place.  Another plus is that they have several TVs so  you can watch sporting events.  Seems kind of wacky for an Italian food place, but it is a welcome addition to me.  As long as you don't expect a 5 star Italian food restaurant with an opera singer, you probably wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant for the local area. Their pizza is about $8 and can feed two people till they're full! Pasta is so so, but would recommend the pizza for sure on those late nights coming back from partying too late...I love that it's 24 hours! Pizza and pasta anytime, and the price isn't that bad either! Waiting to go may take about 10-15 minutes, but there are some nights when you may wait a bit longer 20-30."}
{"text":"This location has closed...now it makes sense why they were out of everything and didn't want to give out players card for free play but based on that experience I wont be visiting the other location on Marks either."}
{"text":"This new joint on Eastern took over from the Beach House.  Sadly, we never were able to get to the Beach House, but we stepped in here for lunch.

As an aside - how in the heck do restaurants NOT make it on Eastern??  Anyway.

Good pizza - great drinks, the bartender Melissa was super nice.  Not too smokey, which is good."}
{"text":"Greatly disappointed after reviewing all the reviews on this page. First of all, it is more pricey then led to believe. Prices too high for the quality of food offered.
First indication that there is a problem is bottled ranch dressing on the salad. Not good. Then we ordered pasta dishes. The sauce was almost pure tomatoe with very little seasonings. Meat balls were tender but boring. Will not be back. Service was marginal at best. Had much better at other places."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town. Good food, great atmosphere, and friendly staff. This place is a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So last night I was in the area and when this place first opened my family and I loved it. I would soon learn regret eating here again. I called and asked if the dining area was open to.children and the bartender let me know the dining area had been closed in general.but she would still let us eat there. Because of her sweet offer I was stoked. Had I had known the dining area was closed everyday because of lack of business I would NOT have eaten there. We had 2 orders of Ravioli, the fried mozzerella, the cesar salad and bread with alfredo sauce for dipping as well as marinara. The Alfredo sauce, which I used to love was a lifeless salty cream of a sauce not tasting anything like alfredo. The marinara sauce was gross too. The tomatoes tasted off beat and kind of old. The ravioli was cold in the middle leaving the cheese to be gross inside. The cesar salad was DISGUSTING. They over dressed the salad and the dressing itself was bitter and bad. The lettuce also tasted dirty. Over all it was a nighmare. We blew $50 on feeling sick and getting grossed out. From our dirty dusty table to the ghost town inside we should have known better. There was a time I used to Crave their Chicken Alfredo. Not any more. I learned the old head chef was no longer there and I think when he left he took the love in the food with him. The bartender was super sweet but as I sent back my salad in a rejection of unhappiness her probing questions told me she was upset I was not willing to pay for something I would not eat. We should have walked out and left but I suffer consequences of my poor decision making.  This is another Restaraunt Impossible waiting to happen. Heck Mr. Irving would clean up on shows from Local Vegas joints. Do not eat at Carmines's even my fried Mozzerella was.over cooked. No love in the food whatsoever"}
{"text":"I came to carmines once again on Friday 3/23/2013 at 12:45 am. Just like last time my pregnant wife had a craving. SO OFF TO CARMINES!!! As soon as we walked in we saw through the bar area that the same bartender (Anthony) that helped us last time was working today as well.  As we walked in I was headed to the bar area to ask Anthony if we could possibly dine in the dining room area. Before I could make it to the bar door he was already walking out with 2 glasses of water and 2 menus and promptly offered to sit us at the same table at which we dined last time. I was glad that he had taken the initiative to great us and seat us before I asked. I have to say that this gentlemen is AWESOME he is a quality employee. 

Let me begin to explain why.... Carmines is a Restaurant and Bar. I can tell that the restaurant part is a full on restaurant given the please wait to be seated and the greeter podium. The bar part I can tell is a full on bar as it is enclosed from the dining area. It's quite obvious when entering after 12:00am that the dining area is closed as the lights are dim and there is clearly no waitress or bus boy or greeter. The bar is open though and you can tell because there have always been patrons when I've been in the establishment and there is a clear window straight to the bar where you will see a bartender manning the bar. Having been to prior establishments like this most bartenders prefer for you to dine in the bar area, this way the bartender can offer their assistance without having to leave the bar itself. Also I have always thought of it as they're bartenders not waiters so they really have no need to work the dining area. The fact that this bartender is kind enough to allow you the option to dine in the dining area or sit at the bar was FABULOUS!!!! After all I went into the bar to give him thanks for the great service and I noticed at that time that he had a full bar and was multitasking both the bar and dining area. THAT'S WHY I THINK ANTHONY IS AN AWESOME EMPLOYEE!!

Back to the review!! lol

After being seated the cook came out and remembered us from last time and said you're the man with his pregnant wife that came last time egh?! And I said \"yes\" he shook my hand and said \"we will make you great food!\" 
We ordered the eggplant parmesan with angel hair pasta and a pepperoni pizza. Once again the food was delightful. The pasta was pasta but once mixed with the eggplant it was definitely tasteful. The pepperoni pizza was delicious and filling so much that we ended up having to take half of it to go.

I highly recommend Carmines especially if you are being served by Anthony the graveyard bartender. He has a great personality and is very customer centric."}

The decor is perfectly Italian and the food delicious and the service is warm and friendly. Just like it was years ago. The homemade meatballs and the chicken parm is awesome. It's also nice to have the family roaming thru the restaraunt talking all the guests. Old school Italian style. Go there, you'll love it! Don't forget to have the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Melenzana Parmagiano, so good you'll smack, Nona! It has been 9 years since I had an eggplant parm this good. As close to NY as you can get from Henderson. 

 I was there for dinner on a Saturday night. There was a 50th birthday party going on, as well as a wedding reception! The outside of the place doesn't lend much to an inviting atmosphere, but the moment you step in and sit down in this full fledged sports bar the friendly staff makes you feel right at home.

I've never been here drunk or late at night, so I can't speak for late night munchies, I can say that what I ate was delicious and the cannoli I had for dessert caused flashbacks of my favorite  Brooklyn bakery.

You'd be a fool to pass Carmine's up. Mangia!"}
