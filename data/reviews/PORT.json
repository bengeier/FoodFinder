{"text":"There's not much choice in Pickering when you want something with good food and a great view. I had never even heard of The Port; my wife and I were given a gift card for this restaurant with a car purchase.  As it's just around the corner from us, we decided to walk there for dinner and have a few drinks, too.    Once through the front door, it was almost as if we'd walked into any of a number of downtown restaurants.  The decor was open and modern, and the music was unobtrusive \"hip\" dining music.  (Somewhat electronic, with nothing at all to catch your attention either positively or negatively.  There must be a small fortune in making this modern take on musak.)  We were offered a seat in the lounge as the dining room was full.  We sat by the fireplace which was nice.  Through the window we saw a great patio on Frenchman's Bay which will be a definite hang-out for us this summer!   We started with drinks which were very reasonably priced. (Five bucks for a bottle of Steamwhistle?! Maybe moving to the suburbs does have it's benefits!!!)  We also got a small dish of spiced olives to nibble at while we waited.  The staff was friendly, competent and efficient, and they all seemed to be working hard and cheerfully.  I ordered the free range chicken and my wife ordered the salmon.  Chicken: A breast of free range chicken roasted with comfort cream cheese and topped with onion marmalade, served with a port poached pear and finished with wine syrup and sage aioli.  This dish was absolutely fantastic.  The harmony of these five ingredients was just wonderful.  Every bite was something special and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  The sweet pear and the savory sage aioli were a beautiful combination, the chicken was moist and cooked perfectly, and the wine syrup added a very pleasing bright note.  I would order it again in a heartbeat.  The applewood cheddar mashed potatoes were also excellent, with the cheddar adding a nicely muted sharpness to the potato.  The other seasonal vegetables were asparagus, not overcooked, and possibly the best mashed turnip I've ever had.  Salmon: This is a wasabi-pea encrusted salmon on a bed of basmati rice and vegetables.  I didn't try the vegetables but they included soy glazed water chestnut, baby corn (which always fails to impress me as they often look like something taken straight from a can and put on a cheap salad bar), bamboo shoots, hearts of palm and bok choi.  I tasted the salmon and the wasabi that encrusted the top of the fish was a very nice touch.  She said she enjoyed the dish a lot but was a little underwhelmed with the vegetables.  They were good, but nothing too special.  After another round of Steamwhistles, we decided to order a nightcap and head home.  I had a Maker's Mark, she had a Bluberri Stoli.  And here's the kicker: a small appetizer, four decent beers, two great meals, and two final drinks...... under a hundred bucks including tax (before tip).  At that price, for that quality, tipping is a pleasure!  We will definitely be returning, often."}
{"text":"Great ambiance with a view of the boats at Frenchman's Bay Marina, and of the Bay. Moderately upscale interior.  Food and service has been inconsistent in the past year, though the past three visits we've seen a return to the early Port experience with friendly smiling staff, tasty creative dishes, and prompt attentive service.  A great place in the GTA for the Waterfront experience. Especially enjoyable on a sunny day in any season."}
{"text":"We went to the Port for brunch and there was a limited brunch menu. The foods was delicious and the service was good. My burger was served hot and the cooking staff was well organized with the meal delivery. It was nice to be in a group and still receive our meals at the same time. We will return in the summer."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork and beans. Disliked it. Tasted like a $5 dish. Beans felt like it was from a can, and the pork shoulder was more like two 3x1\" slices of pork belly. Super fatty and salty. Corn bread was good though. At nearly $20, I suggest trying something else."}
{"text":"You got to Port not for the food but for the location. Having a view of Lake Ontario with the boats and wildlife going by is a treat. Every few months they change the menu. You just find the right thing you like on the menu and it is gone. I wish there was more consistency. The service is usually very good. The foods tends to be pricey. I do wish they would have more to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"I have visited Port numerous times and have always had a great experience.   The dining room is very nice and the view of the Lake,  from th patio, is great. I have been numerous times and was always a good experience. Ever since the menu has changed, it is getting harder to enjoy the food as presentation and quality isn't always there.  We ordered the lobster and pink shrimp roll, the chopped salad and We the freemans artichoke dip as appetizer. The lobster shrimp was was good, the chopped salad had rotted greens and mold on the cheese and the bread for the dip was all over the place. The menu will be changing again in September and I will go back to try it...... I just hope that quality, freshness and presentation doesn't suffer."}
{"text":"It has a gorgeous view!!  Amazing place to chill with friends after a long day!!  A few friends and I went here after a show and I loved every second of it! Our server, Jordan, was beyond fantastic! Unfortunately, we were there a little late and the kitchen was closed except for some \"late night snack\" and dessert options. We shared their Gouda and Cauliflower dip, Jalape√±o Cornbread, and Kale Caesar Salad.  We also had their chocolate cheesecake and bread pudding with white chocolate sauce. 6 words to describe their food: WORTH GOING TO THE GYM FOR! I would definitely go back in the summer to enjoy their beautiful patio space!  If you are looking for a good time, a nice modern space to hang out or to celebrate anything, you need to come here! =)"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant for a birthday party/celebration (mine). I organized before the event that a bottle of red and white be on the table before we arrived. It was to be a thanks to my friends with a little speech.   I arrived last with my friend who organized the gathering. She organized the cake and as we walked I N and gave our names the hostesses informed her (with me standing there) they could not organize the cake....oops....little late to let her know.  So as we both get to the table we are both trying to get through our uncomfortable moments.  The food was good and the company was great. We were able to enjoy our night without allowing so poor organization throw us off our game. I give our group 5 stars for not allowing us to go down a bad path as many restaurants will do to guests. My suggestion, to the manager and staff listen....you never know why people choose your restaurant. People just want outstanding service, excellent food and no issues. I can't give 5 stars as no one really made an effort to fix the mistakes. Good restaurant would not plan an important event at The Port"}
{"text":"We went to this Restaurent on Friday, and I had high expectations - I had made a note to please seat us in the patio if possible, when we got there we got a corner booth n were told we were on the wait list n that she will let us know once space opened up, although after 2 hours there was no one left on the patio, no one followed up but that's ok. It's the food I had the most to complain about. There were 6 of us n we all ordered different things and sides! The kids fries were the best thing served! The cheeseboard was good too. The 'risotto' came out lumpy n without even a pinch of salt! We returns that and said please don't even bother! All of us found our food blanc and unseasoned- we are talking basic salt. Our waitress is the only reason for 2 stars- she was pleasant and kind but the food here is horrible and the service slow!! Ide recommend the view though!"}
{"text":"I came here twice, once for lunch and second time for Sunday brunch with guest on wheelchair. The place is right on the water edge, both indoor and outdoor seating with unobstructed view. Deco is modern, quiet, food is good and service is nice. The location is great for taking a stroll along the waterfront with lots to see close by. Definitely a hidden gem in Pickering!"}
{"text":"Had planned on going to The Waterfront restaurant but ending up at PORT which was a lovely location   We were able to sit on the patio overlooking the lake and with it being a beautiful day it was perfect  We shared the Mac and Cheese (it was ok) and Corn Bread (very good) as starters  My guest had the lobster roll sandwich with warm potato salad and really enjoyed it.  I had the chicken salad which was large and tasty.    One funny thing was it must have rained there last night and the umbrellas were full of water and were pouring into guests with any wind.   There were some gasps as people got soaked.   Service was good and would go back especially for the view."}
{"text":"Great view and atmosphere.  Find the menu somewhat limited and expensive but definetly a hotspot."}
{"text":"Went for sister's birthday dinner tonight and it was a disaster.   They have recently changed the menu and the new menu is very limited and cut a number of favourites. For a starter we had an artichoke and cheese dip- at least I am assuming so as it was topped with a layer of raw garlic and so I couldn't taste anything else.   Next up was the main course. I had a mushroom pasta bowl and it was very bland. I asked for some cheese in the hopes of giving it some flavour.  The cheese they brought was a very low grade parm. The waitress could see that I wasn't happy so the manager came over and offered to replace the meal. As I was unhappy with the sole vegetarian option I went with a kale side salad and the side of Mac and cheese. The salad was good - the Mac and cheese was reminiscent of PC white cheddar KD. My sister's steak was also under cooked - the manager offered a refire and it came back very tough.   The night was disappointing. We had been to Port a few months ago - despite some very bad reviews and liked it but I don't think we will go back. Prices are high and ingredient quality is low. Too bad because the location is spectacular."}
{"text":"Had mostly good experiences here used to go quite often. Seems last couple times was lacking menu options and level of service it had before."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. A child's birthday party took over half the restaurant. We were not informed at time of booking. Children squealing and running around. The bathroom destroyed. Wrapping paper in the floor, no paper products of any kind.  That was the good part. They were understaffed.  The food was terrible. Of 5 meals ordered 2 were returned and we are not whiners. Salty to the point of  making one pucker. Server tried to correct however the kitchen took so long to respond that the others at the table were finished their meal and so 2 of the party went without dinner.  They then offered to make the order into doggy bags. ..at full price after an hour wait. Not a chance! Not impressed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regular customers at Port. We enjoy the service and the food and we have yet to be disappointed. The bartender will always make my husband's favourite drink even though it doesn't appear on the menu anymore. The servers hold themselves to a very high standard, and when they think something isn't up to snuff, they will fix it, even if we haven't complained or commented. Any time we have visitors we always bring them here so they can experience some of the best food, and views, in Pickering."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant for special occasions and always have a lovely time. Delicious, original food, great wine, and a beautiful view of the lake."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for a late Saturday lunch/early dinner at 4.30pm. We were told that we could only order from the \"Bar Snacks\" section of the menu and that we could order from the dinner menu 30 mins later. We passed as I was starving and wanted real food not snacks. We decided to eat our early dinner elsewhere.  ...But we decided to return to PORT for dessert around 6.30pm. The reception was very warm and welcoming. We were seated in the lounge area. My dining companion who lives near PORT and had dined there before, strongly recommended the Banana Chocolate Bread Pudding. She ordered it and strongly recommended that I do the same. I did. WOW! I am not a big dessert person so when I do have dessert I want to thoroughly enjoy it...and I thoroughly enjoyed the Banana Chocolate Bread Pudding! I was having a mini-party in my mouth! Also, it is huge and very shareable.  SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE The lounge has a beautiful view of Frenchman's Bay, but is a little loud. Do not sit in the lounge area if you want to have a really quiet and intimate meal. Lots and lots of sun! There is a beautiful patio that is covered (until the summer presumably).  Service was very good.  NEGATIVE I ordered a decaf coffee and received a very cold decaf cup of coffee that had clearly been brewed earlier in the day. The manager and our server apologized and replaced it with a freshly brewed cup.  VERDICT PASS+...Because we were not able to order any real food at 4.30pm...I give PORT 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Amazing service as the staff is a young and trained well, they served a small event that I had two years in a row. food is small portions but very tasty, kale chips yummy lots of menu tends to shift around. The view is exceptional especially during summer, view of port pier/water /boats /sun almost 180degrees of westside pickering shore."}
{"text":"Didn't like the atmosphere. Food is not memorable."}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was for a special occasion and was a surprise to which everything was flawless, and I wanted to try everything on the menu because it all sounded SO amazing! Since going back after that first time and with the same person (who had been coming here for years) who has agreed with me that the quality of food has greatly decreased. Every time since the first trip, I look through the menu and there's nothing that I want to try, and again, this is the same situation for my friend which is so disappointing because he says over the years, he's never felt that way about this location. We haven't been back since as there seems to be no improvement from each of the times we give it another chance.  Oh ya...the view is lovely, obviously had to mention that."}
{"text":"I'd been looking so forward to it and was very disappointed by the food.   The country pate was bland and under seasoned with a soggy chutney than seemed like a pile of boiled blackberries.      Eggplant risotto featured under cooked eggplant and tasted of basically just pepper.    Chicken and cornbread were both over cooked and very dry.   The slaw with the chicken was great.   Presentation on all of the dishes was sloppy and both of the hot dishes were barely warm.       The location and the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful.   It would be a perfect spot to have a drink."}
{"text":"Congrats to Port Restaurant. Our Valentine Day dinner could not have been any more enjoyable. We were welcomed pleasantly and shown to a booth immediately. Our server arrived quickly and was able to answer all questions relating to the menu. The wine was excellent as were the steaks, vegetables and dessert. Good service, food and decor. A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Went to Pickering for the day and found \"Port\" restaurant. Wanted to sit buy the water and have a nice lunch. I ordered a cheese burger. My companions ordered roasted chicken sandwich and Port Croque Monsieur. They came with the best seasoned fries. I usually use ketchup to eat with the fries. I didn't use ketchup at all.  I ordered cheesecake for cheesecake, which was really good. One of my companions ordered cake pudding. I've never had a pudding before. Sooo good. I will be ordering it next time. The whole meal was delicious."}
{"text":"I don't really know pickering or the burb restaurants so when i met my mom and brother for lunch he recommended the Port.  I loved the location and view.  Since it's the winter we only gazed out upon the icy Frenchman Bay, but come summer with that patio over the water it would certainly feel like Muskoka in the City.  It wasn't overly busy on a Friday at noon, and we choose a table in the bar area.  I looked at the other dining area at the front and it's too chain restaurant boring decor was a turn off. The bar area is all windows and bright and funky (if your into brown).  The view is the winner here.  The order: Calamari grilled in spicy tomato sauce Savory Cheesecake (herbed goat cheese with garlic toast) Bouillabaisse Chicken Brie Panini x 2 Steak Sandwich Ploughman Lunch  The savory Cheesecake app is excellent it looks like a piece of dessert with crusty base.  The goat cheese is herb and the base is a carmalized onion tart of sort it's served with pear compote and garlic toast all goes well together.  The Calamari although could have been perfect was a bit overdone and chewy.  The Chiken Brie Panini's were good and huge they come with fries or kettle chips and my mom had French Onion Soup with hers for an extra $2, I ate the soup since my ploughman lunch was a let down.  The bouillabaisse and Steak Sandwich were flavourful and good portions.  The dissapointment was the Ploughman's Lunch served on a carving board, It consisted of homeade Terrine wrapped in bacon that was very dry, 2 hunks of smoked ham good but not great.  4 slices of white country bread.  3 huge hunks of artisan cheese all the same not an assortment.  Big downfall was the out of season tomatoes, bib lettuce and overly chunky slices of red onion.  3 small teaspoons of onions and pickled garden vegg & one small half of a deviled egg (which was the tastiest on the platter) could have had one more.  This platter is $16.75 for lunch.  I would be embarrassed as a chef to serve this.   I brought almost it all home.  A bit discouraging that the server didn't ask why it was barely touched.  I will go back in the summer and try again.  The view is nice and would stick with a few apps and wine.  bill $134.92  (2 coffees, 2 pops & 2 bottles of pellagrino added) 5 people"}
{"text":"Ambience 5 stars Location 5 stars Service 5 stars Food 5 stars for the chicken 3 stars for the bacon wrapped filet - where is the flavour?"}
{"text":"Overlooking Frenchman's Bay, Port seems like the new place to go to enjoy the summer weather. I came here on a gorgeous summer afternoon and had to wait approximately half an hour for patio seats. It wasn't a big deal since my party wasn't hungry yet and they text you when your table was ready so you didn't have to stay to wait.  Food 3.5/5 The brunch menu is pretty standard with your typical eggs benedict, steak and eggs, etc. The prices are a little higher than other restaurants but you are definitely compensated with the view. We ordered the peameal and cheddar eggs benedict and classic breakfast. The food was basic and wasn't anything amazing but I do want to note that I don't recall any cheddar on my benedict but perhaps it was in the sauce? The meals come with a side of potatoes (better if they were crispier) and spinach salad (refreshing citrusy dressing). The highlight of the meal however was the jam... I know it sounds crazy to rave over jam, but the flavour resembled gobstopper candy. It had a sweet berry flavour with a subtle hint of orange that was so good, it made me sad when I ran out of bread.  Service 3/5 From the moment we walked in, the hostess was very friendly and welcoming. She kindly told us that the patio had a waiting list. She was very chatty and it was a shame she wasn't a server. Our server on the other hand was very monotoned and simply took our orders and brought our bill. She never came by to check on us or ask us how everything was. The other waitresses who we walked by throughout the restaurant were more attentive and chattier than our server.  Overall if we were talking simply about the atmosphere and views, the restaurant would hands down be 5/5. However, the food wasn't anything amazing and the service wasn't particularly great either. I would like to come back to try the dinner menu and dine indoors next time. Side note, they normally take reservations for the dining room but the patio is first-come first-serve basis."}
{"text":"I believe you pay for the view, not the food.  The menu is a bit pricey, considering the small portions, but the view of the harbour (especially on the patio, during good weather) is certainly worth it.  My husband and I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner here, all on the patio, and it was worth it.  We've enjoyed a glass of wine, during sunset, with a simple appetizer to add some serious romance to an ordinary work evening.  Service and quality of food have never been a problem.  I've also noticed lots of children, so I assume it's family friendly."}
{"text":"With all the new restos popping up in town I somehow forget about Port.  Service was amazing.  Great spot down on the water and food was amazing.  We split the tuna and the cheeseburger (great combo).  Regretted not ordering the devilled eggs but it was a weekday.   Also thought the draft beer choices were great."}
{"text":"Went to meet a friend here for drinks in the bar and was very surprised that this gem is hidden where it is and I haven't been here.  Not very well advertised.  Oh well.  Extensive drink list with many different choices for scotch & whiskey.  I like.  I ordered the calamari to nibble on.  It was served hot & cooked perfectly.  Server was happy & fun to converse with.  I would say that some might find this place more on the pricey side, but given the venue, it's fair.  Beautifully decorated & amazing view of the water.  Definately will come back for dinner & of course when the weather is a little warmer to enjoy the deck."}
{"text":"Pickering has something better than just the power plant. Check out The Burger on this menu. Fresh not frozen, juicy and done correctly. A few more fries would be nice. A bit pricey for what it is but your paying for the location and choice. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Steaks are very good. Service is good. Servers are attentive and polite. Prices are a bit on the high side but reasonable.  This restaurant is very much like The Kegg."}
{"text":"Just wanted to reconfirm that Port is still as good as ever. Came back from the Sunday roast this afternoon -- HUGE portion, delicious Yorkshire pudding, and the most amazing horseradish cream. Even the downtowners who we lured out to Pickering loved it!"}
{"text":"A modern, trendy restaurant with a great view.  We were meeting some friends for drinks on a Saturday night. Arrived around 8:30pm and were able to get a booth in the lounge area immediately. The bar is really stunning to look at and the restaurant has great views of Frenchman's Bay, where you can eye the sailboats.  Our table ordered 2 glasses of wine, one cocktail (green monkey) and a pint of beer (Spider Monkey). Drinks range from $9 to $14 each. We also shared two orders of the Southern Poutine - with beef brisket, BBQ pork belly, and pulled chicken ($13). I thought the Poutine needed more fries/wedges as there were only 4 potato wedges total on our plate. Also, more cheese curd was necessary.  Service was pretty good. Our waitress was attentive the whole time we were there.   Port restaurant has a romantic and semi-classy atmosphere - great if you want to splurge on a nice dinner. It's a place where the prices are reflected in the nice setting and fantastic drink selection."}
{"text":"This is a great date spot as the view of the wharf is gorgeous and the ambiance inside is very romantic. The bar area is also not so rowdy. If you go in the summer, get a seat in the patio. To be honest, I'm not a fan of their summer menu. I tried their mac and it was dry and quite bland. In the winter the food is amazing. Their braised beef and gnocchi dish is so delicious, I'm craving it right now. Their savory cheesecake appetizer is really well done and the crostini they serve you is warm. Their Kawartha ice cream and creme brulee are worth saving room for. For a drink, get a pitcher of the white sangria. Definitely hits the spot. The menu is a bit pricey so be mindful. Great Pickering gem"}
{"text":"I have been here many times with my family and on business. The staff is always very friendly and helpful and accommodating. The food is consistently well prepared.  The location provides a wonderful view of the lake no matter the season. In summer there is a really nice outdoor patio.  The selection of food has a number of options for a range of tastes. There is a good mix of consistent favourites and new offerings.  The wine list has a good range to pick from and we all have our favourites.  I would recommend The Port to anyone in the Pickering area looking for a nice dinner for two or a family or a business dinner."}
{"text":"Everything about PORT has gone downhill. Aside from the view itself from the patio and the friendly servers, there isn't much to praise about this restaurant.  Last Saturday, my boyfriend reserved a table of 10 for us to celebrate my 28th birthday and we were all pretty disappointed with the overall service and quality of food and wish we had chosen somewhere else to eat.   Let's start with the good. Our server was fairly attentive and came around to check on us a few times and ensure we had our drinks etc. I wouldn't blame her for any of the issues in the kitchen since she obviously wasn't the one doing the cooking. The view itself is nice since the restaurant overlooks the water.    Onto the bad. With the menu being so small, you would think that everything on there would be really good. Not really the case. For appetizers, we ordered the spicy pickles, calamari, mussels, and 30 oysters (east coast and west coast) for the table. The calamari portion was quite small so I didn't actually try it and can't comment on that. The spicy pickles definitely had a kick and if you love pickles, then I'm sure you would be a fan. The muscles could have been WAY better. I feel like I've had better at chain restaurants. As for the oysters, we were so disappointed. Seeing as how we were a table of 10, it would have made sense to split the whole order in two across the table instead of having them all jammed onto one platter. The juices came out of the shells and having to pass the platter across the entire table, along with all the sauces that went with them was chaotic. I would never order them again if that's the way they are served.  I tried the strawberry smash and it was good. I had 2 in total.  For entrees - I ordered the salmon, as well as a side of the mac and cheese to share with my boyfriend. Both the salmon and mac and cheese were good. I did enjoy my meal. My boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped filet mignon, which was not cooked to his liking and when our server came around to check on him, he did tell her. She did offer to have another one prepared but at that point, everyone had already received their meals and he didn't want to wait another 15 minutes for the other one. Our server did end up removing that entr√©e from the bill, which was nice of her.   Other people in my party ordered the pasta, which they commented was \"just ok\" and about 4 others ordered the cheeseburger. It was really weird to all of us that at a restaurant like that, the most popular thing on the menu was the cheeseburger but anyway, that meal came with fries.  It did take quite a while to get our food. At one point, our server did approach us to let us know our order would be up next. They need to liven up that restaurant. Put some music on!  Overall, dinner at PORT just didn't live up to expectations and multiple people in my party made that known to me as well. Our bill with my drinks, my boyfriends drinks, all the apps for the table, my entr√©e (not including my boyfriends since they removed it), was about $300 with tax/tip and I would assume the entire table easily would have been over $7-800.  It would have been nice if a manager or chef came over to check on the table considering we were a large party but I guess that's not a normal thing for them to do.  If you're looking for a good restaurant in the Durham area, I would head to Harvest, Chatterpauls, A Tavola Bistro or even the Keg. At all of these places, you'll be guaranteed a great meal, great service and feel satisfied when you walk out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for brunch and breakfast and enjoyed the food thoroughly; the view goes without saying -  spectacular.   Last nights dinner was sub par at best. The food was saucy over seasoned  and heavy.  Our server was aloof.    Stick to breakfast if you're going to go here."}
{"text":"I felt really disturbed after my visit here.   Beautiful restaurant with a nice view of the lake but horrible service!!  From the moment we walked in the greeter was snooty and made us wait to be seated even though only 30% of the restaurant was full. She even said, \"wait until I seat the customers coming in behind you\". So wait a minute, we came first but you're going to seat the next couple that comes in AFTER?!!!  Then the wait for someone to take our order was another 15 mins. Keep in mind the place was not even busy and there was more than enough staff to serve. Never once did our waitress come back to refill  our water.  (And the cup was a small size). Great service - NOT!!!!  The food I'll say, was a solid 3 stars, but $45 for lunch with such bad service left a bad taste in my mouth.  I do NOT recommend because no paying customer should be treated that way!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better hidden gems in the GTA.  I'd classify Port as a Joey Don Mills, Moxies & Milestonesque fusionesquey \"premium casual\" dinning experience.  But it's got one thing none of these other restaurants have: a harbour view!    Why can't a place like this exist in the downtown waterfront area?  I can only imagine how popular a place like this would be if it took advantage of our waterfront, instead of the crap we currently have, such as tourist crap traps (which even tourists aren't going to) like Captain Johns!    The deck looking out into the tranquil harbour has got to be one of the more beautiful views in the GTA, and this mid-sized restaurant takes full advantage of it with it's floor to ceiling windows.  The service was pretty good even though on this night it seemed like they had a sophisticated crew of high school kids.  Maybe I'm getting older, but they seemed awfully young.   They were very professional nonetheless except for when our waitress dropped an \"oh shit\" when she realized our bill was wrong.    The food was pretty good.  Everyone seemed happy with the food: our table had the Free Run Chicken with mash, a walleye, a rack of lamb, a steak and I had the artic char with risotto.  My fish was done perfectly and the risotto was very good.  As a table we shared some mussels and their charcuterie plate.  Mussels were good, but the charcuterie plate was the main reason this isn't a 5 star place.  It was some mediocre slices of bread, prosciutto, low end brie cheese along with some balsamic vinegar and dijion mustard dip.  That and a bread basket is an additional cost here.    We followed it up with some Cr√®me br√ªl√©e, apple crumble and cheese cake, and we all agreed our deserts was our least favourite part of the meal.  There wasn't anything specific, but they could definitely rework the dessert menu.  The bar section has a few big screens carrying the game, and one when the Leafs make it back to the playoffs, I'm sure I'll head out here to watch a game or two in the spring.  If you're ever out in the east end, i'd say it's worth a drive to Port, however make sure you have a reservation in hand, as this is THE fine and romantic dinning experience out in Pickering."}
{"text":"It was about 5PM when I arrived with Mum B and our intention was to sit out on the patio. However, the weather was uncooperative yesterday, and the restaurant's patio was closed.  The manager asked us if seating in the lounge area would be agreeable, but we preferred the dining room.  The restaurant manager appeared to be manning the reception area and telling the hostess where to seat everyone.  She was also in charge of the telephones.  From a logistics point of view, this became a bit of a hassle as we were kept waiting for about 5 minutes while the manager was on the phone taking down a reservation, while the hostess stood there like a statue just waiting for the manager to delegate where we should be seated.  This didn't make sense logistically. When we were finally seated at our table, it made even less sense as to why the manager was trying to cram us into the lounge area when there were plenty of tables available in the dining room.  Again, point deductions for customer service.  Upon seating, our server came to our table with the menus and to take down our drink requests.  PORT does not offer their wine by the half litre, its either a 6 oz glass, a 9 oz glass, or a full bottle.  The 2 of us managed to polish off an entire bottle.  We were informed that if we did not finish the full bottle that they could cork it back up for us to take home - real classy!  Bread is not complimentary and comes at an added cost, and water was not brought until we asked for it.  Two seemingly standard features that I would expect at a restaurant charging the prices PORT does.  The ambiance of the restaurant is that of Milestone's/Moxies but with a view and a much higher price tag.  This is one of the busiest restaurants in Pickering - so busy that they don't do weddings here because the cost of buying out the venue is just so costly and that is before the cost of food even comes up.  If we had come around prime dining hours (6:30PM or after) I doubt we would've nabbed a seat.  For starters we ordered the Seafood Charcuterie Board which consisted of a Tuna Tartare, Shrimp Ceviche and Calamari Salad served with Mini Toasts.  The portion sizes were quite small, and each item was about the size of an appetizer spoon.  That being said, the items were very fresh.  The tartare was served with a caramelized onion which Mum B. and I thoroughly enjoyed.  The ceviche as it had a nice citrus flavour to it that was quite refreshing.  The mini toasts provided a different textural component which made for better stimulation of the tastebuds.  For my main I ordered the Organic Arctic Char which was served atop a bed of seasonal vegetables and a m√©lange of tomato & pearl couscous.  It was topped with a tempura pea tendril.  Mum B. ordered the Cashew Chicken which was served with the same accompaniments.  The portion sizes were quite small, but gets top marks for presentation and taste.  The arctic char was extremely moist and tender with a crisp skin.  This is the most memorable fish dish I've had in Canada.  The pearl couscous was very savory with a hint of acidity coming from the tomatoes which went well with the seasonal vegetables which had a slightly pickled taste to them (e.g. sweet and tangy).  The tempura pea tendrils were something I've never experienced before, but I thoroughly enjoyed them.  The batter was nice and light without being too overpowering.  The cashew flavour was lacking in the batter of the chicken.  I also felt that the chicken itself was rather bland and lacking seasoning of any kind.  It was a chicken breast, and being white meat, meant it was also rather dry.  If the side dishes were not as flavourful, this dish would've been unappetizing.  After we finished our mains, we requested to go out on the patio. For dessert we ordered the Hazelnut Dome to share, an Espresso and a Latte.  The dessert was not PORT's forte.  Although they get top marks for presentation, I found the dish to be rather deconstructed upon contact with my dessert fork.  The ganache that covered the outside was great, but the inside of the dessert didn't seem to stay together and had a rather \"crumbly\" texture which made it hard to pick up.  The espresso was great.  They use the Lavazza brand of coffee at PORT.  PORT is a great place to go to, especially in the summertime when the patio is open.  We spent a grand total of 4 hours here and never felt rushed to leave.  I would give top marks for the ambiance and quality of food, but dock a couple of stars for consistency of service. As the evening grew later, our server was MIA and I had to go inside to get the bill processed.  This could be ddue to the fact that they are understaffed as the restaurant does get quite busy toward the latter part of the evening, especially on the weekend.  The damage at the end of the day was $126, which is not on the cheap.  All in all, the portion sizes could stand to be a bit bigger, and the service, more attentive."}
{"text":"This place is so nice. I went here for lunch with my bf. the view of the marina and water is beautiful. The whole restaurant itself is extremely well decorated, I'd say its on the same level with the Keg.   My bf got fried chicken and waffles and I got a chicken wrap. Both were served beautifully and tasted superb.   Will definitely going back for a date night in the near future!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant especially in summer time with the view. At winter too, after a hard day of work, the ambiance and the friendly service, especially this new beautiful friendly waitress (JASMINE) that they recently hired with excellent service served us today was definitely a bonus to brighten up a Monday! Her service was better than some fine dine restaurant, I must admit. One thing that I really like about this restaurant is their all you can eat mussels for $16. You won't get bored as they serve a different speciality flavour every Monday! I usually call ahead to see if I like the flavour before I come, because I am not a huge fan of tomatoe based sauce. Tonight, the speciality sauce was the cream garlic, it was tasty and worth the stinky breath after! The mussels comes with bread on the side to dip the sauce and it's absolutely perfect with a glass of wine! Even the regular menu, the Brussels sprouts were good even when I am very picky with my vegetable. I highly recommend this restaurant if you haven't ventured out to this area!  Jasmine is definitely different from the rest of the servers and it makes a huge difference to the dining experience."}
{"text":"Have been many times, usually just for drinks and to enjoy the view,  which is nothing short of spectacular. The food, as others have mentioned is a little pricey and changes frequently.  I enjoyed some of the original items on the menu... tikka masala, greens salad, steak frites etc. Most of the items have changed however. Service is hit or miss there are a few very good servers."}
{"text":"The setting and location of this restaurant is perfect for a sunny summer day!!   The patio that's open during the summer season is right by the water, where people often sail their boats and can even park it at the restaurant.  It's a beautiful upscale restaurant in Pickering, if you want to feel like you're out of the city for the day. You can even walk further down the strip to see a boardwalk.  As for the food, it's again on the $$ side but flavourful food.   Wild Mushroom Bolognese: $19  - Strong flavour (can taste the wine used for the sauce)  - Decent portion   Buttermilk Fried Chicken: $25+ - Chicken could use more flavour - Comes with Mac and cheese, Cornbread and coleslaw - Mac and cheese was spot on - Cornbread was dry - Coleslaw had a unique taste but was delicious  Would come back on a hotter summer day!"}
{"text":"The service is mediocre.. unless the girl was just having a bad night, but thats not my family's problem. We came to have a great night out for my mother's 52nd birthday. We don't always go out and we chose this restaurant, which didn't even reach near our expectations. We got some apps, a salad, calamari, a cauliflower cheddar dip which were all really bland except for the salad... for our entrees I chose the short ribs, very unsatisfying. My brother got a mushroom bolognese which tasted very woodsy and off. And my parents got this fried chicken plate each which looked like a \"fine dining\" version of a bbq box.. she also never checked up on our food until we were finished with them and never refilled our water and near the end of us finishing our food she placed a bottle of water on our table. The view is nice and near the water, and the decor is very warm and welcoming but when a server that doesn't care about you is the one looking after you, it makes the whole experience not worth coming.. as well as the food being terrible. The dessert were pretty good, but then my mother pointed out that there were a lot of water bugs were all over the windows... honestly.. I would say save your trip over here because there are other restaurants that deserve your night out."}
{"text":"From the great ambiance ... outdoor marina view patio for brunch, the cozy firepit for lounging to the fabulous food ...this place is a hidden gem worth visiting. I love their one of a kind savoury goatcheese cheesecake appetizer and evolving seasonal menu that always keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight and our food was cold. Very disappointing. We asked that the steaks at least be heated up, but ate the mashed potatoes cold. The simplest thing (serving hot food) ruined my experience. The steaks obviously sat out waiting. There was a hair on my plate. We had to ask where the sauces we ordered were. Our server got them for us. Just simple things that could have been easily done."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing restaurant all around! Building is very modern and is welcoming upon entering. Staff is very friendly and helpful . The best part about this place is the food !! Definitely the best food I've had in Durham. Always great and consistently delicious whenever I eat here. Wine selection is good, I have still yet come across a wine or champagne which I have not been satisfied with A bit extra money to eat here compared to other restaurants but it well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Call me stupid for going back to this place once again. Have actually sent back cold food here only to have it come back microwaved... Really? a microwaved 35 dollar ribeye? It was only due to the fact that a family member likes to come here due to location that I came back. If I could do a negative one star I would. Sunday afternoon moderately busy, obviously understaffed and not overly ambitious staff took 45 minutes to bring our apps. Pork bellies and mussels. If it wasn't for the sauce on the pork bellies and a description of what it was you would not know what animal part you were eating, too much sauce and bellies under cooked. Mussels were some of the better ones I have ever had but the toast to soak up extra broth was some kind of pathetic tasteless organic cardboard.  One of our mains were chopped salad which is like a typical Cobb but done in a lazy way. The ham looked like sliced cold cuts, the bacon was cold and dripping in some kind of syrup; gross!; romaine was prepped the day before and chopped some small your could hardly get a fork in it. Non description dressing. Pathetic! No wonder I always order a burger in restaurants because they are hard to f**k up. Although I saw the burgers that showed up at the next table and was almost relieved to see how disappointing it too would have been. Our server was a good sport about all the delays but she naturally had to bitch out the kitchen and management to place blame somewhere.  The Halifax donair was not really sliced off the spit as far as we could see but rather ground meat looking.  Boring food at high prices. Desert was cherry cheesecake, ho hum, Nutella s'mores,  didn't taste that as I am not a fan. I had three fresh made doughnuts with a custard sauce, not bad!!  Men's room floor was so dirty around the urinals that my shoes actually stuck to the floor!! Come on people you haven't got a clue about hospitality !!!  The only saving grace about the whole afternoon was that we got the apps and desert for free because because a family member is a regular there. Even at that the bill was  almost 240 with tip. I only had club soda due to being the dd.  Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Considering we like to choose Port for fine dining on special events, I am consistently more disapointed each time we go, I am not looking forward to going again if we do. On my birthday dinner a few weeks ago I ordered the steak, bacon wrapped, and the bacon was delicious, but the steak was (1) overcooked, (2) chewy, (3) farthest thing from fresh. I've worked in the Food and Beverage Industry for years, and I understand Monday's are slow, but this was just awful service and quality for a $45 meal."}
{"text":"My fiance surprised me with a brunch at PORT, it's a really beautiful place tucked away and close to the Marina in Pickering.  We had the pumpkin pancakes with a dollop of creamy mascarpone cheese on top sprinkled with pumpkin seeds (I think the menu said candied pumpkin seeds but they were raw)  Maple syrup and a small bowl of fresh fruit accompanied the pancakes.   Tasty!"}
{"text":"Port is one of my most favourite restaurants in the area. It has the best patio and is such a beautiful restaurant. We go here for all special occasions etc. The service can be hit and miss, most often it's good but there are times we never see our server till the end of Our meal, meanwhile wanting a refill on our drinks. When they first opened the menu changed so often you never knew what to expect the next time you went. As much as I thought I wanted the same food from the last time I was there I realized it kept me coming back for more to see the next in season dishes. Lately they have hardly changed their menu at all. Yet still delicious and I always enjoy a meal there, I wish they changed it up a little more often to bring that old flare back. One of my favourite appetizers they had when they first opened was a bruschetta parfait. Mmmm please bring that back!  I will continue to go to Port but find myself going there less lately due to food selection, I think we got bored of it!"}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm overly impressed with this place... and definitely not worth the money.   We came here for Sunday brunch and the bill came to nearly $100 for four people (after tip).  We ordered three Northern Benny's, a Sausage, Bacon & Egg, a bottle of San Pellegrino and coffee/tea.   I have to say, I wouldn't get the eggs benny again. The presentation lacked lustre and honestly, I've had better hollandaise sauce from the local greasy spoon! It was really thick and had started to set by the time it was served leaving it with a strange texture. Quite disappointing. The eggs were cooked perfectly though.   The service was okay considering how busy they were and the atmosphere's nice with a great view of the wharf. There's also dining room, bar and patio options for seating.   Our food was mediocre at best so I don't think I'd be in a rush to come back but, being only steps away from the waterfront, it made for a nice spot to 'brunch'."}
{"text":"I've been to Port 3 times over a 15 month time span. And as much as I want to like it, the food is just so mediocre that it really makes it hard to come back for a meal. Don't get me wrong, the views and ambiance are stunning, especially for Pickering so if anything, go for drinks and time it right so you can sit out on the patio and watch the sunset. But the food?! Guys, seriously, you are an upscale restaurant- get a better chef! I was there yesterday and no one in my party of 3 would recommend eating here again. My lobster tail was literally boiled and put on a plate with no seasoning and no thought to presentation. I asked for garlic butter and instead of bringing me melted butter i got actual butter. My hubby had the ribeye which tasted like the grill. And the veggies the steak was supposed to come with were missing. How does a plate go out to a table incomplete? (Btw the veggies were saut√©ed red peppers that I could have made myself). My mother in law had the cheeseburger which was nothing to write home about (Unlike the burgers at Moxies). The fries and champagne were the best part of our meal (the fries are actually delish). $165 later - not impressed. Please take a good hard look at your menu and kitchen. There are few options in Pickering and this should be at the top of the restaurant list....sadly it is far from that."}
{"text":"A week and a half ago, I took my beau to Port. I wanted a restaurant that he's never been to, with an awesome patio view seeing as he's a Summer baby. I've been to Port on 3 other occasions but never for dinner. I had went for brunch, drinks and even appetizers so the dinner experience was something I anticipated.  I called in for reservations for 7:15 and they told me they could do 7:45. No biggie at all. I'd rather show up and have a table ready then go to the restaurant and have to wait out an available table. I mentioned it was my dude's birthday and I really wanted a patio table but on the website it does clearly state that they do not take reservations for the patio and it's first-come-first-serve. The hostess on the phone said she will note that I want the patio so that if something comes up around that time they will reserve it for me. I greatly appreciated that.  About an hour before I was to arrive, I called to double-check on my reservation which they did note and the hostess said \"Yes, we have you down. Would you like us to write Happy Birthday on the cake when you are finished with dinner?\" I really thought was a great gesture as the previous host did make a note mentioning it was for a birthday. Paying attention to your clients...very important!  The atmosphere in Port is beautiful. Even in the dining room they have large windows so you can catch glances of the patio view. Dark wood and dim lighting  give it a romantic but lounge-like vibe.  When we arrived, we lucked out and a patio table was reserved for us. My guy was impressed by the beautiful atmosphere as we overlooked the water and saw boats sailing by. Port is situated in Pickering near the beach but the set-up makes you feel like you aren't in Ontario. They also have a fire-pit in the middle of the patio if you just want to sit down and sip on some wine.   We weren't interested in any appetizers but we did want to start on the drinks. I originally wanted the \"Painkiller\" but they ran out of coconut liquor which is a highlight of the drink so I had to settle for the Ginger Peach Julep. A little disappointed because this was the 2nd time this year that I went to Port and they didn't have ingredients for a mixed drink. Womp Womp! The Ginger Peach Julep had Bourbon in it and I clearly wasn't prepared for the taste. As cute as it looked, it tasted absolutely disgusting. All I tasted was ginger and bourbon. I tasted no peach at all. He had a cherry rum and coke which was safe and quite tasty. But really, how can you go wrong with that?   Our waiter was a friendly slightly nervous cat who was borderline inappropriate. Y'see, my dude thought the drink I ordered was Ginger Peach Tulip and we had joked around about how it tasted just like straight liquor with nothing else and when the waiter asked how it was, my guy said \"Tastes just like a liquor tulip\" and the waiter said \"ooooh! That's what you do tonight! Lick her two lips. Get it?\" I somehow missed this dialogue and only paid attention after my beau said that was a pervy joke but laughed anyway. Other than that, he was well-behaved  We both ordered the same thing \"Butter BBQ Roast Chicken\". We also ordered a glass of Pinot Grigot to go with our meals.  It was quite tasty! A small portion when looking at it at first, but realistically, it didn't need to be bigger. It was satisfying. After dinner, the waiter gave me the nod to confirm I'm ok with them bringing out the cake and 2 min later the yummy Double Chocolate Guinness cake appeared with a Happy Birthday drizzled in caramel. I was relieved that they didn't do the whole singing \"happy birthday\" in a cheesy way type of thing. This restaurant seems like they keep those special moments intimate and private and I could appreciate that. The cake was AMAZING! Way better than I thought it would taste. The soft subtle chocolate/Guinness mix was light and not super sweet, so it completely worked well with the sweeter icing smushed inside the cake. The slice was also rather large!  The service was pretty good and even though this is a bit pricier than the average restaurant like Moxies or Milestones, it didn't break the bank. For all of that it was under $150. Not too bad for a Birthday Dinner at all   I would completely recommend coming here for a special occasion or even just to treat yourself in the Summer preferably over Winter."}
{"text":"Great food in a great area. Its usually busy so call ahead to make sure you will be able to grab a table or book a reservation. Its also not a place to wear your swim trunks, dress up a little."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant a bunch of times - It's a nice choice for bday's, ect if you live in east Scarborough or Pickering. BUT: Went there for lunch yesterday - I'm not going to get into boring details but basically how hard it is to put a 4 table + a 2 table (of which there were plenty of empty ones) together for 6? There was 1 table set for 8, which was occupied & I was told that's just the ONLY table 6 people could be accommodated at (it was also added: \"we can't just tell them to leave\" Well - no I don't expect that of course - but is that the only solution staff can think of? Really?). Eventually, after over an hour of waiting, we just ate inside. It was so disappointing but I didn't want to complain because we were there for a special birthday. Good luck, won't be back, ever."}
{"text":"Southbound from Pickering town centre as you approach the residential and pier lies The Port.  As beautiful as it is at night, its view is more stunning during the day.  With its modern design, beautiful outdoor patio along the waterfront, this place is unique...and probably pickering's little gem. The food is fresh, staff and management are friendly, and food is just yum! They too have an extensive lists of drinks.....and their bar is opened with a late after dinner hours menu for small bites to pair your drink.   Since its proximity is so close to water, their seafood is a delight, especially their Oysters and Calamari....4.5/5  Steak burger: juicy melt in your mouth dish, packed with their handcut fries, served on a butcher board. The meat is tender, and definitely a pleasure to indulge in.  I will be seeing PORT this summer, its a great hang out place...especially if you're local ;)"}
{"text":"I can tell you that the restaurant's lakeside view is gorgeous on a sunny afternoon. That alone I'd go back for.  Very friendly and attentive service.   The restaurant environment itself is as advertised in past reviews - modern clean and well kept.  For brunch we chose to dine on the following:  Appetizers buttermilk fried chicken & cornbread with a side of fennel slaw. Lobster and pink shrimp roll. Entrees Halifax donair The burger Classic breakfast (sausage, eggs, toast, bacon, arugula) Maple Fish & chips (best item imo)  Drinks: water, double Caesars, & mimosas.  When I go back.. I'll probably just get salad and have it accompanied with fish. The buttermilk chicken and lobster rolls were pretty good too.  Come for an afternoon brew with some intimates.. eat light.. stroll the harbour.. bring a straw mat. Take in the sun.. Walk around the little shops..get ice cream..or a tattoo.  Come for the view."}
{"text":"One of my favourite waterfront restaurants in Durham. Gorgeous view from the backyard patio in summer or from high tables by the bar area. The food had changed for the better over the years and the ambience casual yet great for dates or get together with family and friends. They also craft some cool cocktails! The Buttermilk Fried chicken with corn bread and hot Buffalo sauce on my last visit was surprising burst of sweet, tart, spicy flavours and the braised lamb grilled cheese sandwich perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Great location, attentive wait staff and great food. Nothing beats having dinner as the sunsets overlooking the water. We had the feature linguine pasta which was amazing, ribeye steak, and risotto. Everything was tasty...my steak was slightly over cooked but it was still very good. The only thing was the food took a long time to get to the table, so the back house must have had an issue. We will go back again for sure and will see if the delay happens again."}
{"text":"A client of mine brought me here a few years ago. I finally got around to taking my husband there tonight.  I have always lived in Pickering, but I never knew about this gem.   The food is fantastic. It is on the high end of prices, but I feel it is worth every penny. Fresh fish, amazing fresh salads. Nothing tasted like it came from grocery store fare. THIS is what fresh food tastes like.  I had the kale chips. They had a delightful subtle fruity taste to them. I ordered their fish special of the day. It was perfectly cooked and tasted straight out of the ocean.  We also ordered the cheese platter. I am not a fan of blue cheese, but I did not want to waste it. I dipped into the fruit and citrus reduction sauces and was delighted at the combination of flavours. I also had a pitcher of sangria, and my husband sampled their rums.   All of the staff was friendly and eager to make everything just right.  And of course, you can't beat the view. We arrived an hour before sunset, it was very pretty. The atmosphere here is very slick, but one still feels comfortable in jeans or business casual.   Expensive, but worth every penny for a night out."}
{"text":"I was invited out to my favourite watering hole for an early birthday celebration. Yay!  The weather was great so we got a table on the patio, overlooking Frenchman's Bay and the setting sun. Beautiful!  We ordered some drinks and went with burgers and fried chicken, keeping it simple. The burger was cooked really well and was tender and juicy. The fried chicken was crispy and flavourful. The service was excellent! I must be getting old because I can't remember our server's name but she was very good.  My dining companions shared a fruit crumble for dessert and we were surprised with a complimentary round of port wine. Happy birthday to me!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location and views and very friendly and attentive staff. Menu is simple with some lovely wines and craft beers available. The Tuesday date night special is a fantastic deal and we devoured the white bean dip. Roasted chicken was tender and juicy, and steak was a tad bit on the salty side. Creme brule cheesecake was outstanding.   Great date spot or place to sit and enjoy a glass of wine and the sunset."}
{"text":"This place looked amazing. It looked modern and super clean. The view! Really beautiful and makes the food taste better I think.The servers were polite and was kind enough to tell us their daily special.  Their lunch menu was very well price and lots of amazing choices. I ended up with the chef omelette special. It's an omelette with pulled pork inside. It could've been a little bit seasoned, but the presentation was really good. And their in-house ketchup was delicious, great topping.  I would definitely be back. The drive to Pickering is worth to go back to this restaurant. My must try list are the poutine and the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Where are the wait staff! Sitting about 10 minutes before they notice me! I feel left out and woebegone!"}
{"text":"There were some hits and misses here.  Seafood chowder $12 - oysters, scallops, shrimps, potatoes, asparagus and carrots. Not a cream based soup like I was expecting. There was a good amount of seafood. Not a huge fan of the soup and way over priced at $12.  Large spring salad $12 - the salad was no where near large and it was just a plain veggie salad. Nothing special about it.  Lobster shrimp roll $16 - comes with dressed potatoes and a small coleslaw. The best dish out of everything we tried. Plenty of shrimp and lobster meat which tasted fresh. The bread which they used really stood out for me. It had this nice crisp on the outside and a nice chew. I know its just bread but trust me, its worth mentioning...lol  Service was outstanding and very friendly. The patio with the view of the water just gives it that extra tingly feeling to get you lost in the moment."}
{"text":"Port reminds me of Moxie's. Chic, modern, and trendy. Fancy drink selection, and really good food. Service is borderline. It's okay - but for the atmosphere, I would be expecting more attentiveness. It's usually fairly busy. It's in a great spot, patio is nice. This is the type of place where mid 20 somethings to mid 30 somethings would enjoy hanging out with friends for drinks"}
{"text":"From PIckering and I am always looking for a high caliber place to dine with my gf. I did not like this place and would never recommend it. The food had potential but each dish was missing something. The soup was just broth and the lobster salad club was so overpowered by the onions I couldn't get the taste out my mouth. The service was the most dissapointing. My gf is a server at Joey's which is exemplary on professionalism. We were waiting on drinks, waters, she never asked how anything was, and I walked by us like she didn't care. As my gf is a server we like to tip well and couldn't bring ourselves to tip more than 15% ( we shouldn't even had left that.) Most of all I left pissed off and that is the worst thing for a restaurant.   PS brunch was $70 for two with one caeser."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch scheduled here today and was pleasantly surprised by the location and local ambiance! On a warm summer day you may think you are in Hilton Head, Sc or Ft. Lauderdale/Miami! To add to it, the weather as sunny and perfect to have a nice lunch with the big windows looking over into the marina and bay! One little complaint, open the patio on a day like this!  We won't have many more left this season! Many of your clients are cooped up in office buildings all day!   To the food, I ordered the blue corn crab and seafood burger which was yum!  My lunch ate ordered the Chardonnay fish and chips which he seemed to really enjoy!  All was excellent tasty and well presented. Service was very attentive and considerate! Just open that damm patio on a nice day!"}
{"text":"This place is probably the most upscale type of restaurant in Pickering. The location of the restaurant is a lake side setting. The decor on the inside is very similar to a keg but has grand windows that look upon the lake.  My favorite part of the meal was my blondie! Its tough to come across these caramel brownies which are absolutely delectable. The main however was ok, nothing worthy about singling out. I had the baked trout, which extremely lightly seasoned and served with steamed vegetables. Restaurants should stop serving steamed vegetables, most people can make those at home with ease. In terms of ambiance it is good but food its uncreative."}
{"text":"This would be a great place to hang with friends. Nice and modern inside, and even better outside beside the marina! So what's with the food and the service??? Waited forever in between orders. At one point the waiter came and collected the salad forks, which would normally be okay if you were not in a booth. We all had to pass our dirty forks down to the end of the table ... we should have refused! Some of our food was stale and cold, and the taste was passable to not so good. When we asked for more grated cheese for our pasta we were told it would be $1.25 extra per person because ... wait ... they use a very expensive Parmesan cheese!! Bread and oil are extra too. We ordered an espresso and it came without a spoon or sugar. When we asked for sugar, the waiter came back with one little packet; so we asked for more, and he came back with one more little packet!! One good thing: the duck quesadillas, but not good enough to make me come back. It was by chance that we were in Pickering and I cannot see how anyone would go out of their way to come here. Port can remain secretly hidden in the GTA."}
{"text":"I was there for Mothers Day! And it was very good. Set menu for monthers day did not disappoint. I had eggs Benedict,dessert was carrot cake and starter was a basket of banana bread,oatmeal cookies,scones.  The banana bread is to die for."}
{"text":"Dear Torontonians:  Yes, there is life outside of our own city limits and oh boy, is it good! I know, because I recently got to explore the city of Pickering and try out the restaurant Port nestled in the stretch of Frenchman's Bay.  The space is vast with over 200 seats split into three separate dining sections (main, bar and outdoor patio) that fit into whatever dining atmosphere you crave for the day (cozy, semi-fancy or laid-back). You must check out the patio in the summer because it absolutely to die for.   The menu has a lot to offer if you're looking for comfort and refined classic Canadian dishes. They focus a lot on local ingredients, including the Atlantic salmon which is cooked to perfection and visually stunning.   If you're looking to get away from the awful Toronto line-ups and want a meal that gives you top-notch Toronto quality, Port is it."}
{"text":"The best part about this restaurant is the view and location - right on the water, nice sized patio.  Breakfast is really good, eggs benny is my recommendation.  Also great oysters!!"}
{"text":"I have been many times and each time had a different experience.   Never a particularly bad experience but also never a particularly great one.  The food is good but overpriced for what it is.  Many dishes leave you hungry.  The deconstructed cheesecake should be removed from the menu as its a pile of dry ingredients.  The short rib is delicious and filling (one of only a couple dishes thay are).   Port is ultimately a good place for a few drinks with a nice view."}
{"text":"High scale restaurant in Pickering. We had the Date Night special on Tuesday's with shared appetizer, shared dessert, and 3 choices for entree. It was hard to decide on which entree to choose because they all sounded delicious. The truffle bean dip appetizer with buttered baguette slices was very good but filling. I wish they had a soup option which would be a bit healthier. There was no choice of dessert which was disappointing. The service was very good. My only complaint is that there was no change table for children in either washroom. It was difficult to change my child on the low couch in the women's washroom and would have been an issue if someone had been sitting there. Also, not very hygienic but I had no choice. Strange to have high chairs but no change tables."}
{"text":"Love Port, best patio in Durham plus a great menu. Sunday they have a roast dinner to die for!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for the first time on Tuesday. I really liked the service and the location. I know the draw is the location. It was way too cold to sit outside but I will definitely be coming back for the view.  As far as the food goes, it was good but expensive. I had the seafood stew and it came with thinly sliced potato chips which I thought was weird. Bread was not offered at the table and again that was strange to me. My friend and I shared the salmon, seafood chowder and the smores dessert along with a glass of wine for me and a diet pepsi for her. After taxes it was close to $70! That is a lot of an ok amount of food.   Again I will go back for the view and maybe have a drink and some appetizers  but I don't think I will make the drive to Pickering just for the food."}
{"text":"This place has it all in Pickering, great location for suburbia, nice marina beside it and subtle but semi-chic decor. Unfortunately, this is where it ends. Bread there is an extra charge, super fancy parmesan cheese is an extra charge; however, trying to flag your server to no avail, pepper for your pasta, tap water and having the hostess take a group photo is all included! I personally ordered the brisket and rib combo. The rib sauce is orange soda based but tastes tart, the fries were stale and cold, the brisket was cooked well but again the sauce they drown it in just wasn't to my liking. The coleslaw was first rate. The prices I found were somewhat high for dining in the middle of nowhere yet they seem to pack the place. Life's easy without any real competition in the immediate area. I will nit be returning needless to say."}
{"text":"Great place, staff and food.  I love it in the summer on their patio. It's beautiful!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and I know I'll be going back again!  First of all, the ambiance is spectacular. As soon as you go in you see a clean, crisp restaurant with pretty lighting. As soon as you go further in the restaurant you get to the windows and can see the beautiful port!   I also through my sisters birthday party here and the staff was very accommodating! They told me I could bring balloons, favours and whatever I wanted to decorate the tables with. Some restaurants don't allow balloons so I was really happy to hear that they were more accommodating :)   I've been to Port for brunch and lunch but not dinner.  To start with I had the Freeman's Artichoke Dip. I cannot tell you guys enough how AMAZING this dip was, my mouth is watering thinking back on it! The bread with olive oil that it comes with is so good on it's own!  For brunch I've ordered the Eggs Benedict. Now a good eggs beni relies on the hollandaise sauce and Port completed aced this one! The spinach and goat cheese also added that extra flavour.  The one thing I wasn't too crazy about was the fish and chips (I know, shocker considering they have a lot of seafood!) but it just didn't have a wow factor. I was expecting a bit more flavour, well cooked and a good sauce. The fries though, they were yummy!  The \"Designated Drivers\" was a great touch to their drinks menu. Non-alcoholic specialty beverages always get me at restaurants. The La Fresh is my favourite. If you're a lemon lover like me you'll thank me for this later. Berry Fields is also delicious! It has more of a berry flavour. Overall, the presentation on their drinks were stunning!  To all my east enders; if you haven't been to Port you should definitely go! It's a hidden gem for me :)"}
{"text":"One star For welcoming greetings today at the restaurant. \"The dirty blond hostess \" greeted us today, and she told us right away that we can't seat at the bar because there are parties and this place is full. ( place was almost empty when we were leaving) Hostess brought us to empty dining room in a separate place, where we did not want to seat down. Hostess was so rude, she told us that they are so busy, that guests reserved seat earlier( we reserved a few days before too) , and there are many birthdays ( my was yesterday) , and there are many permanent  clients  ( who to heck I am , we are coming to this restaurant very often) . This is the worse hostess I saw in years , the management should be aware of her. Very rude an welcome hostess."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place from co-workers and clients alike. A nice spot on the water with delicious food all the time. After looking at a menu, I decided to go for lunch with a friend. It was pretty easy to find, but being out in Pickering it is a little remote and I doubt that many people know about it unless they live in the area. You can tell that it is situated in an affluent area as it is literally right on the water next to docks where prestigious boats and yachts are parked alike. The view was so-so for the time I was there but I would imagine it to be great if the weather was a bit nicer, and I went earlier in the season instead of a drizzly fall afternoon.   The service there was what I would expect at a place like this, very professional and attentive to what we needed and was ready whenever we were. Don't remember the name of the server but overall they were great.    I had a hanger steak which was absolutely amazing. Oddly enough I have never had one before and it was just delicious. I kind of want to try making it myself, but it was well balanced with roasted potatoes and fried brussels sprouts. When I go back (and I definitely will go back), I would be tempted to try something different on the menu, but I am quite confident I would get the hanger steak again."}
{"text":"One of the nicest spots I have been to in the GTA!  'The Port' is a beautiful romantic spot in Pickering, you will enjoy a quite lovely experience watching the sun diving into water, with a peace of mind while sipping your chardonnay!! wow! The scenery is real nice, with all boats and yachts parked by the shore..it's always nice, quiet and the ambiance is just great. Makes it a perfect spot for a business meeting, a date, a celebration of some sort or even just a night out at the bar with an old friend! You won't go wrong with this place.  Service is always professional, well trained and ready to answer any questions and explain the menu.  In terms of food, the appetizer selection is limited, but all great choices and tasty. I would say the food can be improved a little, but everything else add up to experience and make it a memorable one."}
{"text":"3 Star + 1 Star for the view when the weather is nice  I can seriously just chill out at their back patio every time when I am in Pickering with a pint of beer or a glass of wine!  Port has one of the nicest set up to enjoy the beautiful view of Lake Ontario. It is just hard to believe sometimes you can just enjoy this resort like setting right in your own town without going down south!  The food though decent but might be a little pricey which is more in line with Downtown Toronto's prices. A $19 Cheeseburger probably a little too rich for me for lunch!  So I would probably settle on drinking a draught beer ($7-$8 which is quite reasonable) from GLB, Beau's, Nickelbrook, Muskoka and even 5 Paddles next time when I am here and have a snack next time when I am back!"}
{"text":"Very nice venue but poor food quality. Dish and chips was stale and we could smell the overly used oil of the frenchfries."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio, lovely neighborhood!  Everything was delicious there! Would definitely go again and again!   Customer service is not memorable, but good!   Tip: Their attempt at beaver tails is more like a fried donut. Not authentic at all. Hit up a food truck for the real stuff!"}
{"text":"Port is down on the Pickering Waterfront with a great outdoor patio in summer and a modern, well appointed interior that overlooks Frenchman's Bay.  I usually have the Tika bowl with tofu which is spicy and comes in a large, hard tortilla shell.  It is filling and flavorful but also healthy.  Very well done.  I also like the fish and chips but avoid having that with any frequency given that it is decidedly less healthy.  They also do a weekend brunch which is good. The huevos rancheros is solid as is their eggs Benedict.   Overall, its a great setting with a warm atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Nice for a drink and to sit in the bar or patio..but food isn't great and is over priced with horribly small portions(including the pints).They change the menu quite often..which is great...but they seem to miss the mark...even keeping a couple simple dishes would really help them, in my opinion. However, the last time I went, the fish in chips were outstanding!!  Hoping to go back, try something new and to give a better rating. Rooting for the port based on the location and the ambiance."}
{"text":"This is the place to be when it's nice outside and you want a cool breeze coming in off the lake. Port has a beautiful patio that extends right out over the lake. The inside is nice and modern with a full bar and TVs but I have to tell you if you're given a choice take outside.   I went for brunch and got fish and chips as the main and grilled calamari as an app. The calamari was very good grilled Nicky, not over cooked or chewy and the dressing they used was a Tex mex type blend with just the right a ought of heat. It was quite enjoyable. The fish and chips I got was good. A nice piece of fish firm and crispy outside and tender inside, the batter was made with Chardonnay and you could taste the difference from its beer battered brothers. It came with maple malt vinegar which was aright but the dill pickle tartar sauce stole the show in my books.  The fish and chips came with a side of fries- home cut and fresh. Overall it was a good pick. I would have liked to see some slaw on the side of those chips but you can't have it all."}
{"text":"The view is ok but the food is not good at all.  Can't understand how they can ask those prices and not have someone in the kitchen that can cook.  Nothing appealing on the menu for me to want to try again.  Won't be back.  Much better just down the road"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. It's a nice, quiet (depending when you go)  It has one of the best patios ever.  Location: It's on the Lake next to the Pickering marina, so in the summer you can sit outside at brunch sipping mimosas watching the boats come into the harbour or watch the ducks swim by. Sigh. Heaven.   In the winter and fall you can sit in the lounge area with it's high windows watching the waves.  So relaxing.  Vibe: It's a nicer restaurant. Nothing exorbitant price wise but nice. The people that brunch hear look like the country club / sailing set. Chinos, golf shirts, cute summer dresses.  No worries, I was wearing jeans and flip flops, the lounge is a bit more casual, and actually cooler. it was all good there.  Food: All seated in the banquet chair hybrid booth we ordered the roasted garlic hummus plate appetizer, the souffle pancake and the fried chicken club to share and (much needed) coffee to drink.  The coffee came first. It was actually really terrible.  We were there just after the place opened.  The coffee tasted like it had been around for a while.  Who ever made it likes their coffee strong. It certainly was, it punched back pretty hard.  The Hummus came next. It was in a good looking dish.  It tasted delicious. The dish  hummus was covered in a sprinkling of what looked like cayenne.  That was just the kick that elevate a great dish to fantastic. It came with small rounds of  bread (still  oven warm) cucumber, yellow and green zucchini, pickled beet ( yum) and pickled onion (weird). I would have never paired pickled things with hummus, but I will from now on!  I will get this every time I come.   The Hummus. Cayenne and crispy chickpeas on top. The best dish of the day!! Next we waited, and waited.  Then we noticed that everyone who came in after us were getting their food. We hadn't seen each other in a while, we had already cut our hunger with the hummus, so it was all good. We got a refill of strong coffee and waited a bit more. The waitress ( who was so nice by the way) came by with her and the kitchens apologies and said the pancake wasn't coming out like they wanted so it was going to be 7 more minutes.  She put down a plate of bread with butter. Compliments of the kitchen.  um. nice gesture. I mean a free drink would have been way better, but it's all cool.  The bread was nice and warm from the oven, steaming when you ripped it open.  butter melted into it. Kinda hoppy tasking like it was a beer bread. Was delish.  Complimentary bread. Oven warm, couldn't capture the steam rising from it.   Who doesn't like free soft warm bread? So then we waited some more. Seven minutes passed and we still waited some more. We were still catching up so it was all cool. They are lucky we are so easy going, it was now well over an hour wait.  So the food came.Looked great!!   The pancake looked great. Worth the wait. Housemade obviously. Blueberry Compote, the whipped cream has a slight vanilla flavour, and it was sprinkled with icing sugar. we noticed after that it said there was maple syrup but we never noticed it, actually we talked about asking for some but decided the blueberry and cream were enough  Next we dug into the fried chicken club.  It contained avocado, tomato, an ancho ranch dressing, and friend chicken.  It came with a side of fries.  This was just okay.  I wouldn't get this again. it was messy and with the tomatoes and sauce, it was really liquidy and it made the inside of the bun really soggy. The fries were absolutely delicious.  So this was the first time we came for brunch. To be perfectly honest it was disappointing. $15 is definitely too much for a pancake, especially one that was just good. Coffee was bad and the sandwich disappointing. But when we came for lunches and dinners the food was great.   I guess we can say the food is inconsistant.  Ill be back because I do like it, and the view is spectacular.  The neighbourhood is wonderful."}
{"text":"We came in here on a Saturday evening around 6:00pm for dinner. Without reservations we took our chances and were able to snag a table in the lounge. Later the hostess informed us we had just beat the rush as there were no more vacant tables left and a wait to be seated.  We were seated at an intimate round butcher block high top table with leather back chairs situated in front of a gas fireplace against a stone wall. The mesmerizing views of the glimmering bay were breath taking even more perfect was the timing as the sun was soon setting. The restaurant itself is stunning, very modern, dark grey stone tile flooring, high industrial ceilings painted in teal, and a large wrap around bar with a glimmering black counter top.  For drinks we started with two refreshing glasses of nicely chilled Pinot Grigio.  For our apps we we went with the Kale Chips served with a roasted garlic & lemon aioli dusted with shaved Grana Padano. These were the perfect munchies to nibble on and watch the sunset. They were perfectly crispy and nicely seasoned and I really enjoyed slathering the chips the rich creamy aioli.  For my main I went with the:  Three Cheese Tortellini - Cheddar, Habanero & Jalapeno Monterey Jack and Mozzarella, Spinach, Rose Served  beautifully in a white and blue china platter, it was a very hearty portion. Very rich and creamy, loved the added spicy kick from the cheese. Comfort food at it's finest.  Hubby went with the other pasta choice:  Shrimp & Scallop Carbonara - Pancetta, caramelized onions, fresh herbs, sundried tomatoes, Chardonnay cream sauce, Grana Padano, Linguine Noodles Again hearty portion with tons of baby scallops, loved the crispy salty pancetta adding another depth of smokey salty flavour  For Dessert I went with the Mud Pie which actually wasn't a pie or even close to what the description indicated. Instead what I received was a Milk chocolate brownie with toasted marshmallows on top and drizzled with caramel sauce. When I asked the waitress if I received the wrong dessert she stared at it for a while and then told me they have 3 different pastry chefs and they all do there own take on the dessert? I think she was just covering for there mistake. The brownie was average not the best nor the worst.  Hubby got the Kawartha Dairy Ice Cream. It comes with 3 scoops however the waitress returned to inform us they were out of chocolate so he got 2 scoops vanilla and 1 scoop strawberry. However the ice cream taste wise wasn't spectacular and it had a very strange texture not creamy and partly freezer burnt.  Overall what really makes this restaurant is the view it was just stunning! Come at sunset and reserve a table in the lounge by the window and enjoy the intimate romantic atmosphere while all your worries melt away with a glass of wine."}
