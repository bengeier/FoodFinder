{"text":"Food was awesome and the service was great.  Wide variety, nice and affordable.  My kind of place!  I especially loved the butter chicken.  I'm a fan - I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Has a good variety of beer and curry based food. Service is excellent and bar tender remembers and welcomes you every time. ( even recalls the beer you had last time )  Very enjoyable. Definitely a local pub where same people frequent. Would go back just for the service."}
{"text":"Lighten up on the salt! Ordered the blackened salmon - all I tasted was salt. Even the veggies were covered in salt. On a positive note, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I went here for a Friday after-work thing with a friend. Very pleasantly surprised! Pretty cheap and very relaxed. I ordered their Wylie currie (it's their special at $10) and also had their in-house Wylie beer (a pilsner - and the pitcher is $10). Pretty good quality! Good spot for a relaxed get-together. Basement has a pool table (not sure if it's coin operation, just saw it).   The waiter/bartender was a really nice guy and a had a good music playlist.  Considering the area/neighbourhood, it's quite cheap!"}
{"text":"We work close by and so we eat here often. The food is really great, we haven't tried the Thai food that is their specialty (it's not our taste) but the everything else is really good if you just need a quick lunch. The prices are not outrageous but they aren't conducive to easy takeout either, they charge for extra dressing on the side.  Usually we have their wrap sandwhiches- those are great. If you are getting them as takeout, be sure to not leave them sitting as the wrap will get soggy. Their nachos and fries are really great too. The service is so friendly, nice and helpful!  For sit in it's a really great casual and easy going atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for 20 minutes and both servers have walked by me at least 10 times each while serving other customers. It's not even that busy!   Not even a glimpse? Not even a drink of water? I swear I'm not wearing a cloaking device.   Screw this place. Never coming back.    *on a positive note the place itself is cute and clean and the menu is cheap"}
{"text":"Oh gosh. Not good at all.  I ordered the chicken strips and fries, and it tasted like the dank smell of dirty shag carpet from the 70s...from the awful processed chicken, to the fries that tasted of old oil, to the ketchup that even tasted strange.  The server was new, so I won't gripe about someone who clearly has no experience - we are all in that position on occasion. I do though, think it a display of poor tact for the person who was training her to instruct her to try to up-sell me directly within earshot. Generally customers like to feel like more than an extra two dollars and a check mark on someone's task list.  Additionally, if you want to know their terminal codes, just sit near the bar.  I ate the food as I was hungry and without the time to search out an alternative. I suspect I'll regret more than the taste..."}
{"text":"I read all those comments about bad service and mediocre food and keep wondering... Where do you people come from??? Wylie's is a local pub, I've been going there for almost four years, rarely missing a Friday. The service is amazing, and I haven't had a bad meal once. Do I expect a haute cuisine? No.  Do I expect a butler with Irish accent? No. What I do get though is fresh beer, cheap shots and AMAZING food. Nothing to do with real Na'an? How many times have you been to India, honey? To actually know how Na'an should look and taste like... I would think your answer would be \"never\". The waiter passed by you? If you failed to notice, he's alone working two floors, and you probably been a total c...t to him. Somehow my glass is always full, and I get my food within 7 minutes of ordering. On a busy night.  So, instead of judging and making idiots of yourselves - just be realistic. If you want to get an amazing meal for under $40 for one (a lot of alcohol included), nice atmosphere, great music (thanks, Jesse) - that's the place to go.   And go ahead and find something better in Thornhill...  I love Wylie's and recommend it to all my friends. None of them was ever disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was a little too spicy for me but it was still a comfortable place to sit and eat. I'll go again and probably just order something else. That's how much I like the place."}
{"text":"The service was just okay, as in not friendly.  I had an Indian curry, and the spices were great, however the chicken was dry, and the naan was nothing like real Indian naan.  I was surprised considering all the positive reviews.   My friend's Chicken Marsala was tough and dry too."}
{"text":"I came here last night and I really enjoyed it! The bartenders are friendly and chatty, the space is clean and the beers on tap aren't bad!   After a couple rounds of Sapporo beer (on tap), the munchies were a comin'. The menu here consists of; specials (generally curry-type focus), salads, pastas, Asian Curry's (both Thai and Indian), Wylies \"favourites\", soups.. So fairly extensive.   Over the night many staff and regulars mentioned how good the Curry's are, and cheap at 9.99.   I opted for the nachos, with added guacamole and chicken. This was shared between three people. This was definitely large enough.. the portion was huge! I'd also like to mention that the toppings were LAYERED! A sign of good nachos is when you have cheese on chips even at the bottom of the pile. Nice work on that one Wylies!   You can reserve the larger tables beforehand, I recommend this when coming in with a group."}
{"text":"Good place for pints on a Monday night. 3.50 Jameson and Jagermeister specials and cheap ptichers. Good service as well. The place attracts and older well heeled crowd and seems to have quality food as well. Definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Great food here and solid portions without breaking the bank. Great service and location right by summerhill station. It's definitely my new go to spot when I'm uptown. There seems to have a lot of regulars sitting at the bar who know the people who work there and the owner which gives it a homey feel. Our server was very kind and willing to answer all out qs about the menue options."}
{"text":"Just walked in off the street cos my brother wanted to watch the hockey game. Great service, good food, at the time I was there (Saturday night), there was no music (might have been cos of the hockey) so we could have a conversation and not be drowned out by noise. The food is pub fare and is good. Good selection of beers too. I'd deffo come again and I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Poor service. Also the food wasn't \"bad\" but it certainly wasn't good. I had the nachos supreme. They tasted and looked like they were made in a microwave by a teenage boy. The only saving grace is cheap beer. I will likely never return. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Strictly on a pub basis this place earns four stars easy... Note - I can't comment on the food.  We went here for a friend's birthday because of the drink specials and the place did not disappoint.  The waitress was fun and attentive and on a saturday night it got fairly bumping.  I was drinking 3.5 Jameson's all night - and left with a sub 30 dollar bar tab, pitcher's are 12.5 in Rosedale / Summerhill this place is sure to be a new go to spot!"}
{"text":"A surprising find for a great Pad Thai. $12 for a large, super yummy, well presented pad thai available 3 ways. I started going because it was convenient. I moved, and I keep going back because it's great.  Friendly relaxed service, too.  My only \"beef\" is that every time I go, the same bar patron is sitting at the same stool, telling the same bar stories... which I guess means it's perfect for regulars"}
{"text":"- bad service: they charged me extra for both side salad and mayo without telling me abt the charge ahead of time, when I complained the waitress giggled? then the other waiter told us she was off her game tonight? friendly, but I was unimpressed - mediocre food, slightly pricey - okay atmosphere"}
{"text":"Seeing how Subway really made my day with their faux food and shoddy service   I was fortunate to find this lovely book walking down Yonge street...I decided to take the plunge and try the lunch side  Black and Blue burger with fries seemed safe enough....seeing how the bar was busy the bartender was kind enough to make small talk with me while I waited for the food to be prepared  The burger is one of the largest ones I have ever seen hands down without it being a speciality burger or competition (see: Holy Chuck)    It was grilled medium well to perfection with the right mix of Blue cheese and condiments (they give you the ketchup and Mustard to apply to the burger) to satisfy my hunger   The fries weren't anything special simply tasty and some house garnish to add some kick to an already superb lunch.  While I grant 4 stars as a review...that's simply based on the fact I had take out Instead of dining in but it certainly one of re best take or experiences I've ever had personally   I'd eat here again without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I had no idea of what to expect walking into this budget friendly \"pub like\" restaurant in the usual expensive Summerhill stretch of Yonge St.  Even more surprising is the restaurant serves delicious Thai food that could impress the best critics in town!   It was a bit brisk out, so I was in the soup bowl mood - the Thai mushroom soup translates into the perfect warm my belly mood, accentuated with lemon grass and lime leaves. For my main I opted to try chicken curry with vegetables in a light coconut sauce with rice--perfect portion, and taste that left me completely satisfied!   This not so traditional \"pub\" also serves up some non traditional pub fare that includes the Bar's signature yam fries, and huge slabs of homemade meat loaf mixed with garlic mashed potatoes and of course the gravy!   What an great surprise, as this will be added to many lists of mine and a regular spot on my lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"This has all the essence of a local 'cheers'...but of yesteryear.   Personally, I think the locals have long forgiven its lack of ambience, its tasteless food and its hit or miss service for the trappings of a predictable hang out with friends.   As far as local pubs go, it's fit for a box checking exercise and not much more. Each time I go, I'm reminded as to why its very infrequently.  I also feel like there is a creepy owner watching people on the cameras in the back.   I don't know, it must be an acquired taste, i'm not so convinced. It's a marvel its still around."}
{"text":"Fantastic local bar and restaurant that serves dinner till 2am.  Also the chef is very accommodating and will make anything you want even off menu if he has the ingredients.  Service is excellent and they remember your name.  Lovely cozy bar where everyone knows each other.  Lots of great beers on tap.  Nothing but great things to say about this place!  Primarily a sports bar with two big screens upstairs and three downstairs along with a pool table which is a perfect room for private parties or to lounge with friends on their comfy couches.  I also like the table by the window for watching the world pass by as you enjoy a great meal and drink.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wylie's has been another favorite hangout spot for our birthday lunch dates with colleagues because it's literally a 2-second walk from our office. We have come here numerous times for special occasions, the most recent being today for someone's birthday. The interior has a bar area and also a dining area depending on the purpose of your visit. We have always sat in the dining room everytime we come here. However, there is barely any lighting, which I personally think sets a depressing mood for the customers.   Also, I've noticed that service here has always been hit or miss depending on the day and/or time we go. Sometimes they are efficient and other times the wait is longer than usual, which was the case today, when we went for lunch, but I think it's because there were two large groups present today with one of them being our table of eight, and only two waitresses on duty. The one who attended to us was very friendly but I kind of wish that the neckline of her shirt covered her up more rather than reveal too much. Sorry, but I'm old fashioned, so when I see a lady on staff wearing something revealing, it kind of tells me that she has no respect for herself or her body. If it weren't for this, I would have easily given a 5-star to this place.   On a positive note, the prices are very reasonable for the portions of food you get, especially during lunch hour. Today, I ordered their chicken quesadilla for only $8 approximately, which tasted fresh and was big enough for 2 meals. I want to have the rest for lunch tomorrow. My other favorite items on the menu that I have tried during past visits were their bruschetta, fish and chips, burger, and their pad thai. They also have their daily specials, which I want to try, probably this Friday when we come back for another birthday lunch."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there on Sunday morning. Undoubtedly the worst breakfast I've ever had in my life. The bacon was like cardboard and probably had been cooked several days in advance, the sausages were like wooden sticks ,dry and totally without moisture. Very disappointing and I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant/pub with amazing food. $12 pitcher = great deal. Don't forget to get your 50% off of second dish coupon on dine.TO."}
{"text":"We found ourselves in Wylie's around midday on a beautiful Sunday. Some of us ordered lunch while others justified getting a very late breakfast.   The restaurant was clean, opulent and well-lit. The bar and the liquor shelves had a Victorian look and a classy mahogany finish. There was even a sizable library of classics next to the restroom. I suppose the patrons of this establishment like to brush up on their Tolstoy after their morning coffee.   I was well within reason to expect, at the very least, a satisfactory meal. I ordered my eggs over-easy and toast sans butter. The eggs I got were cooked over-hard and dry as a bone. The two slices of bacon and eight, that's right, eight measly home fires would have left Nicole Richie hungry. To make matters worse, the toast was drenched in butter. Thankfully, a trusted companion offered me some consolation onion rings and a bite of his steak sandwich, which was clearly necessary.   I think it is very unfortunate that a waitress with such poor listening skills has been left in charge of such a classy restaurant with so much potential. I always try and give people in the service industry the benefit of the doubt but when you only have a single table to tend, I expect more of an effort."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with some friends.  Really enjoyed the food, but thought the portion size for the breakfast burrito was a bit small.  They also didn't give us enough taters, but this place was affordable, which is more than I can say for most of the other summerhill restaurants.  The food took fairly long (30 minutes) to arrive from ordering, which I found to be a bit longer than usual for brunch."}
