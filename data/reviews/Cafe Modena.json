{"text":"I would pretty much rather eat anywhere else. I would even say McDonald's is better than this place. We ordered a cheeseburger, gyro, fries, fruit salad and a water bottle. First of all, the delivery person was 20 minutes late, like outside of the 65 minutes it was supposed to take. Secondly: - The cheeseburger was CHARRED. Like disgustingly burned and hard on the outside, and the inside was dried up. - The gyro was gross... just like salty meat in gross bread. Just didn't taste fresh at all. - The fries were the worst I've ever had. Just kind of empty fried hollow things. - The fruit salad was FROM A CAN. - The water bottle never came. I asked the guy where it was and he just shrugged. Didn't offer me a free drink next time or anything.  Basically I'm never eating here again and you shouldn't either unless you just want to throw your money away. I could barely stomach it. Bleghhh"}
{"text":"Had to wait an hour for delivery so that bummed us out. The driver didn't say a word. Instead he handed me the paper to sign and they walked away... Philly cheesesteak was luke warm but tasted okay. Really wish I had a better experience!"}
{"text":"Nasty! Not happy with anything I just had delivered will never ever order from there again... Especially the cheese steaks and hollow cold hard as a rock fries..BEWARE!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Ive had their pizza three times, i love that they dont drown it in pizza sauce. Its affordable and they have a pretty large menu so i change it up from time to time. Their chicken caeser salad is great, and so are the gyros. I always get it delivered and im never disappointed. Its definetly my go to place if i wake up hungry and feel lazy to cook or go buy something. Delicious food."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out for lunch today and the food was phenomenal.  I had the stuffed shells and it was excellent.  The sauce had chunks of tomato and onion and fresh italian parsley.  The ricotta filling also had fresh parsley and was seasoned perfectly.  Usually when you get take-out pasta from a small pizza place, it's over cooked and tasteless....  this was AWESOME!  Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I have known this place for more than 15 years and the same people have been working there. They know their regular customers (including me) by name and their consistency and food quality is what brings me there again and again!  Last order: double cheeseburger with bacon. Yum."}
{"text":"Me and the boyfriend wanted some food for breakfast. We didn't want dominos or Pizza Hut for breakfast for we ordered delivery from this cafe. It took them 40-45 mins to get the food over here. They have pretty decent price for all the food in the menu. We decided to get baby back ribs which is my favorite type of food and he got the fat cheese burger. I'm pretty picky when it comes to my food and it was a alright for me. The ribs were soft and filled with BBQ sauce. It something I would eat but not something I would spend 12 dollars on. Other than that the cheese burger was pretty good. The ham patty was delicious. I will try the food here again.  P.s: next time give us some folks or spoons to use when u delivery :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered the special #2: 1 topping pizza, \"fingers\" and fries. The pizza from this place is exceptionally terrible. They overloaded the amount of cheese on the pizza and didn't even cut the pizza all the way through. We both had 1 slice each and tossed it. The fries were just as bad they was no crunch to the fries, they're just painfully soggy. The chicken was ehhh okay. Wish I read the reviews more thoroughly on this website but like others I certainly learned my lesson. Wish I could get a refund."}
{"text":"I'm not too big on writing reviews but I'm pretty irked with this place. I will admit, I am a little at fault for some of this. My coworkers and I order from this place from time to time while we work our late days. The food is just mediocre, but because the menu has some variety we can all agree on it.  Well we ordered from grubhub, and I tried updating our new address on the website, but I guess it didn't save. Mind you, our new building is 20 feet away from our old one, so it's not that huge of an inconvenience. Apparently it was. I'm at work, and both the driver and the restaurant are calling my cell phone multiple times, leaving multiple messages. Eventually when I can call them back, I apologize and give them the new address and move on with my life. I can see the driver walking around across the parking lot, I figured he'd find us pretty quick.   Another 20 minutes goes by, and he finally shows up. Immediately when he walks in, I'm apologizing for the confusion. He's not saying a word, shaking his head at me and huffing and puffing. He asks me what address we're at, looks at his slip, tosses it and the food at me and walks out.   My advice to you, sir: we all have to put on our smiling customer service faces, even when we're annoyed. Drop the attitude.  Oh also my grilled cheese sandwich was dripping in grease? or butter? or something. Either way, it was hard to eat. My coworker's egg salad sandwich was so full of mayonnaise that it was falling apart. Come on. I'd say the equivalent of gas station food.  Not ordering here again, not worth it."}
{"text":"I think the picture says it all. I ordered cheeseburgers; I received cold, dry, rubbery hockey pucks."}
{"text":"Took over an hour to deliver.   I called to check on it, and the woman that answered told me they \"got behind\".  How?  I ordered at around 4pm!  I didn't know there was such a thing as bad ribs, until now.   I think they boiled them and called it a day.  Food is cold.  Fries suck.  Baked beans are sweet, but not in a good way.   Just terrible.   Never again."}
{"text":"Over priced. Grumpy driver. I could get 2 subs at Jimmy Johns for the price they charged me. The dessert (Cheese cake) sub parr...thick bread, hardly any meat. I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is disgusting and the service is terrible. To top it all off my husband got food poisoning!! I will never return or recommend this place to anyone. Stay far away!!"}
{"text":"The place was right down the street from our resort and it took them 1.5 hours to make delivery.  The pizza is the lowest quality you could imagine. The fries were soggy and cold.  The chicken (aka \"fingers\") were greasy and rubbery.  You could literally bend them in half and the grease would drip out and soak the breaded outside.    We all equated the food to what you would get at a skating rink in the 1980's.  Bland, low end ingredients, and grease ridden.  If you want a quick way to evacuate your insides, this is the best you can get.    I wish I would have read the reviews before we ordered.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Delivery Order 10/4/2015  Order was for 2 gyro sandwiches, cheese fries, regular fries, and extra tzatziki sauce on the side.  The gyro sandwiches had no lettuce or sauce on it despite it being called the \"Big Fat Gyro with Tzatziki Sauce\". The meat was good though.   The cheese fries seemed like they were the first thing they cooked because they weren't even lukewarm and the cheese was completely hard.   The regular fries were cold as well.   We did finish our gyros, but couldn't eat the fries because of how bad they were.  Edit: Ordered through Yelp's Eat24 app."}
{"text":"No sign from the street - just a window banner. This hole in the wall is a hidden treasure. The food and prices is what wil bring me back here again and again!!!"}
{"text":"once again I had to dine at the best restaurant in ALL of las vegas ! had a chessiest philly cheesesteak sandwich ( it had 3 cheeses, and there was layer after layer of it too, boo koo strands with each delicious bite ) and they piled on the steak, mushrooms, and peppers !! also had a grilled chicken ( and mushroom ) calzone ! stuffed to the brim with onions, peppers, mushrooms and a insane amount of chicken. it just doesn't get any better than caf√© Modena, and I will never eat anywhere else !!"}
{"text":"I feel bad every time I come in here and see the place completely empty, so I want to try and drum up some extra business for them.  I came here a total of two times (after the first successful ribs visit) and tried out some more of their lunch specials on their flyer.  Unfortunately, they said it was for delivery and pick-up only, so I had to get it to go.  I had the burger and fries ($5) which was excellent for the price and I came back another time for the wings and fries ($7) which was good (I tried the teriyaki sauce) and comes with 10 wings which are reasonably sized and tasty.  I'd definitely say try out some of their lunch specials if you get the chance (lasts until 4pm daily).  Plus it comes with your choice of fruit cocktail or chocolate pudding for dessert."}
{"text":"The nice thing about this spot is that they deliver and offer quite a variety. They also have numerous lunch specials, combos, etc. The pricing isn't bad at all. And the delivery time isn't too bad either - about 40 minutes.  I tried a variety of food for my first order - wings, cheese fries, Philly cheesesteak, and pizza. The cheeseteak was the best of what I ordered (4 stars). Good flavors and there are lots of different cheesesteaks to choose from. The fries were so-so - and the cheese melted over the top was minimal and did nothing for the fries (2 stars). For the wings, I opted for the Cajun. They were about average (3 stars). I would have enjoyed them more if they were spicier and saucier. The pizza was eh (2.5 stars). Edible and not bad for delivery, but definitely lacking. However, they do offer lots of different pizzas and I am curious to try some different toppings and see if that doesn't make it better.  While not a stellar first experience, there was enough good going on that I will definitely be ordering delivery again and trying out some other items."}
{"text":"This is the only place in town that my family and I order pizza from! Their pizzas are made with great ingredients and always come hot and fresh. I so far have only ordered the \"Modena special\" it's Freakin bomb! The lady on the phone is always nice but the delivery men don't ever really seem personable. But none the less the pizza is great!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service is absolutely horrendous. I will never order from here again. I called about ranch that was supposed to one with the pizza we ordered and the side of ranch we ordered on the side which neither came and the woman on the phone immediately raised her voice and was extremely rude when I simply asked her about it. I am shocked at this point because it was so uncalled for. She kept speaking over me and wouldn't let me finish what I was asking. Such a stupid way to lose a customer but her rudeness will not be tolerated."}
{"text":"My husband has order from here several times and were really excited because they make a killer cheese steak - well after tonight, I never will order from them again. Basically, they messed up my order, a cheese steak with provolone - they made it with American with no mayo. When I called them to tell them I'd like for them to make me a new one, they agreed and I drove back there to pick it up. After coming back home, they I started eating and I am not kidding, not only did they not put cheese on it, it had about 1/2 cup of mayo in it. If this is how they're going to treat they unhappy customers for a single order, no thanks."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it arrived 20 mins early!! Spaghetti and meatballs was pretty good. Mozarella ceese on top was excessive.  Garlic cheesy bread was pretty good too! Even the reg garlic bread was good, prob my fave part of the meal. Also got a Cesar salad but saving that for tmrw. Shaved Parmesan looks BOMB. I would order here again."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I decided to try this spot out since they deliver and they are close by. Their delivery was extremely fast and their chicken parm and lunch special spaghetti was delicious! Looks like we found a new spot to order lunches from. Not only they are affordable but the food is great!"}
{"text":"I feel like Cafe Modena deserves an update from me.  So here it is.   I came across Cafe Modena a few years back and it is one of my favorite spots to eat at when I'm in the area, like I'd be here at least 4-5 times a month. It's located off of Spencer and Warm Springs inside of a bar named Chris's Place, the bar and dining area are actually separate so it doesn't feel like a bar.  Entering and looking around you'll probably think that there is no way the food here is any good, the decor is old and most of the time I've been there it's empty except for the party I'm with and some smaller parties but I can I assure you the food here is excellent. I mean it's not \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" like what 5 stars means but it's made very well, always consistent in the quality, and taste very good for traditional, non-fusion type of food, better than your standard neighborhood bar food.  My favorite here are the calzones definitely the calzones. The regular calzones are reasonably priced at about $8-10 and are huge.  They even offer a large for $5 more and those are a beast. I've never gotten a burnt or undercooked one. The insides are filled with nothing but deliciousness.  There's a plain, a vegetarian, spinach, grilled chicken, ham, and pepperoni and I've had them all my favorite being the spinach. Cafe Modena is actually my preferred place in Vegas for a calzone.  When I'm not ordering a calzone which doesn't happen that often my 2nd favorite is the Big Fat Gyro with Tzatziki Sauce and fries. Gyros are still pretty new to me and I've only had them at a handful of places. They're good, I enjoy them.  It's one of the items others ordered often.  Nothing here is what you would call small. In fact for the price the amount of food is generous. I came here one Friday looking for a small meal and ordered chicken quesadilla apps. Thinking it was going to be way to small for me I decided to add the wings and fries special which was only like $7. The chicken quesadilla had a nice thick mixture of cheese and chicken. It was plenty filling on it's own and I still had the wings and fries coming.  When the wings came out I ate a couple of the wings and called timeout. There were about 10 wings and large pile of fries, no way I could finish that after eating most of the quesadilla.   The lasagna and spaghetti are two other excellent choices. The rest of the menu are your usual items like pizzas, pastas, soup, salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, etc but they'll probably be big in portions and low in price. The daily specials are also a deal.  As I said earlier the decor are kind of old. It's dressed in pink and turquoise pastel colors with a couple old televisions but it has cable and is spacious."}
{"text":"i ordered chili cheese fries and they gave me fries with cheese and pinto beans straight out of a can. not canned chili, not even the chili hot beans... just regular pinto beans. how is this chili?"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if it was an option! Spinach calzone was flooded with garlic and tomatoes couldn't even eat it! On description on whatever site I ordered from said spinach and cheese nothing about garlic and tomatoes and they didn't care wouldn't replace it worst customer service Gross crust was soggy. Cheese fries were cold with hardly any cheese! Spaghetti needed sauce way to dry! Never ever going back!"}
{"text":"I just ordered an order of Cajun wings and spicy buffalo pizza. The quality of the food was good but omg it was soooo salty!!! I'm a person that likes salt but this was way beyond painfully salty. I would not order from here again. I had to drink a gallon of water after 2 slices of pizza and 2 wings ."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need something saucy and cheesy. The baked ziti at Cafe Modena hit the spot with its fresh homemade chunky marinara sauce and melted ricotta and mozzarella cheeses. A giant bowl of it with garlic bread. It is just as good as it sounds. My husband was equally happy with his gyro sandwich and fries. We liked the thick Tzaziki sauce served with it. The lunch specials which are served until 4 p.m. are very reasonably priced, especially for the amount of food. We were the only ones there at the off peak hour of 3:00 and got excellent service. It's not fancy inside but comfortable. There is a little bit of a smoky smell from the bar next door but not enough to be off putting. We will probably be back if we are ever in the area and have a craving for some good Italian food."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour to recieved 2 fish sandwiches flooded with mayo when we asked for light mayo...it was so drenched that our bread was completely soggy and fell apart as soon as we picked it up. We also ordered the popcorn shrimp that was abnormally fishy, and cold. Barely ate any of it and was not worth the wait or the $30 we spent. We won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Oh M Gee,  Just ordered from them because I got a a flyer in mailbox. I'm happy about life after ordering the #5, of which came with surprise fries (Yay!!!) Also, I received a coup from Eat 24, that made it all that much more worth it. My only issue keeping this from a 5 star rating, don't water down the wing sauce. it was thin and did not stick to the wings, thus making me toss them in the only hot sauce I had (sriracha, of which made them aaamazing!). Other then that, everything was perfect!   I feel like I finally found \"my\" place to order from. Beats the heck out of that Angelina's nonsense, down the road."}
{"text":"The food is really good. However, they have increased their prices. A pizza lunch special use to be $6.99 with 3 toppings. It has now increased to a whopping $9.99! Uuuugh how crazy and to top it off it does not even include a can of soda. So my question is where is the darn special for a small pizza?"}
{"text":"Consistently good. We've ordered at least a handful of times, when we don't want a pizza or Chinese. Always hot and on time. Its nice to have a delivery option that's not just pizza. Pasta, salads, calzones. Subs. Burgers! Affordable fare."}
{"text":"This place is only a mile away and it took them two hours to get us a subpar cold Pizza. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE DO NOT ORDER."}
{"text":"When you first come in the place is always very quite aside from the bar next door. This is the perfect example of the loving hole-in-the-wall spots that you're always looking for. It is a family owned restaurant that my family and I have been coming to for a few years now. Their food is always consistent and their wings are THE BEST. They are always butter, crispy and their sauce is so good. Ignore the \"yellow\" star reviews. This place is the bomb. (:"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for lunch. The Caesar salad wrap with chicken was loaded with chicken Not much romaine lettuce and tons of dressing. It would have been awesome if they had something with crunch and more lettuce with less dressing. It really was a liquid mess by the time you get half way down. The zucchini was dry and obviously frozen processed food.   I work in a secure building so when I ordered I write call when you arrive I will come out. The delivery guy made my co-worker (who was outside on her break) call me on her phone. I was kinda shocked. Then when I came out he wanted me to sign the eat24 receipt and didn't have a pen. I had to go all the way back in to my desk and sign it and bring it back.   Not ordering from them again. I was expecting fresh food not what I got."}
{"text":"Awful service. Ordered a cold cut three meat Italian sub on Grub Hub. The sub showed up with no meat at all. Manager never did call me back after I called to tell them they did not put meat on the sub???? . Also ordered spaghetti and meatballs. The worst I have ever had. Spaggetti was mush, meatballs were reheated frozen ones and sauce had no flavor. Don't waist your time, even the coleslaw tasted funky!!! I would give it zero stars if I could. Thanks to Grub Hub for doing the right thing and refunding my money. Hopefully they drop this place from their list of restaurants."}
{"text":"Decided that delivery was the best course for dinner since after getting home so late I do not feel like cooking. Being so late I was not sure if I missed the cut off for some real delicious delivery. I decided to consult my handy Yelp app and found a great restaurant that sell pizza and other goodies too. This restaurant has a local location where customers can eat a physical place or order delivery. Delivery again was the route I went. There menu is very extensive and thought I would try them out.   The online order process was smooth and I did it through the Yelp app, and it is being delivered by GrubHub. I did have to call the restaurant directly since the Yelp delivery app does not allow me to put the apartment number or building number in. Plus, I feel comfortable talking to a human making sure that they did get the order. Since it was so late the employee that answered the phone was imputing my order when I called and informed me that she would be delivering it too.  While the Yelp app did give a certain window of time it was delivered later than what the delivery time should of been. I was not in the least upset since I received everything in the order perfectly. I ordered a Garlic Pizza and it was so great the feta cheese was so amazing and fresh tasting. The cheese pizza that I ordered for the twins was delicious. It was just a really good pizza. The ingredients that they use are so much better than most averages pizza restaurants too. You can taste the quality of their food. As an appetizer I ordered fried mushrooms with ranch and garlic knots. The balance of garlic on the garlic knots was just perfect. The fried mushrooms were some of the best that I have had in a long while . I will order from here again. It is so great to try new restaurants but when you find one that Las really great it's worth a little dance and celebration."}
{"text":"Ordered a special chee, chicken parmigian with noodles, mini tacos and a Greek salad. It was all awesome except the salad was no where near fresh with gross cucumbers and nasty tomatoes. I'll order here again but won't order a salad lol"}
{"text":"Will not order from again. Ordered fried mushrooms and a chicken Alfredo at work. I work at a warehouse and it is locked after sundown so I have in the delivery notes to call the hotline so someone will knew they've arrived. Instead, the driver sat outside and honked for who knows how long. I didn't know he was here until someone came back from their bathroom break to tell me about it. The mushrooms were fine, though the ranch was so watered down it would not stay on the mushrooms, so I gave up on that before I made a mess and ate them dry. The chicken Alfredo wasn't even edible! The chicken was dry, most of the pasta was still crunchy, and the sauce was so cold and lumpy I'm not even sure it was heated up to food service specs in the first place. I ended up throwing it away because I don't think it was actually safe to eat. Definitely not the kind of quality I'd expect from a restaurant partnered with Eat24."}
{"text":"I love the food!! It tastes amazing and very fresh. So glad I found them!!  It was really accidental and providential. I needed to take quick food to a New Years Party and I had nothing to take. Fast forward and that was my first exposure to Cafe Modena. They were open and delivered my order within the hour. I was beyond impressed. The quality of their varying menu items will leave you impressed (relieved for me taking food to snobby foodies). I've ordered 3 times since Jan 1st and have been pleased with each experience."}
{"text":"The most ridiculous place ever. Food is always wrong. It would be better to bet on a $100.00 machine in Vegas.  You never ever get the right food and always a Cop out excuse   Like oh we have a new waitress or new cook. Save your money a tick tack and a glass of water is more filling."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger and a side of fried mushrooms.  The order was super fast.  The mushrooms were great and there were a bunch of them.  However, I ordered the burger medium and it arrived not only well-done, but very burnt."}
{"text":"Ok, I've lived in Vegas almost 9 months,  and up until now,  any food i've had delivered,  i've had to throw out, uneaten.   That is until Modena!!!  Yay,  finally decent food that delivers!!  Hubby and I are both home sick.  The food was so good the first night,  we ordered AGAIN Saturday night.   Not just Pizza.... Both nights I had Catfish dinner.  Fish was cooked perfectly,  white plump and flakey, delicately seasoned.  I also had the BEST chicken noodle soup I've ever had from a restaurant.  Little noodle flowers, lots of chicken, green beans, carrots, corn and peas.  A healthy dose of black pepper made the seasonings blend nicely. Yummy! Hubby had Giant Mushroom Cheeseburger one night and Double Philly Steak Sandwhich the next night.  He said both were good.  Big portions, with big steak fries.  His side salad was more than just a heap of iceberg lettuce like most takeout salads.    Delivery took about 40 minutes,  and we both ate big meals for under $30 total.   I don't know about their pizza or dining there,  but I know they'll be added to my speed dial!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Have ordered from here 4 times now and every item has been delicious. They are very quick delivery and food is always great!"}
{"text":"I honestly have to give this place 5 stars because i have been feeding my family this place for years!!!! There bbq chicken fingers are amazing! ! My family loves there burgers. We always get delivery, and there on line ordering is easy. I love the patty melt. They have interesting pizza specials, we also enjoy the calzones big and scrumptious. Homemade ranch! We Have recently moved but they will still deliver out to us. I would really have to say give it a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Las Vegas from Cerritos, CA. We decided to stay in one night and order a pizza. So We randomly ordered a pizza from Cafe Modena La Pizzeria. It was Delicious! It was delivered hot and on time. The ingredients were home-made and the veggies were very fresh. The pizza was fully loaded too. It's a family owned and run business. And the service was very warm and friendly. I highly recommend that anyone visiting Las Vegas, who decides to have a \"pajama day,\" call Cafe Modena. They deserve 5 stars+."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast but that was the only good thing   The food was so nasty   The spaghetti tasted like the 1$ frozen ones from the grocery store  And the popcorn shrimp tasted like old nasty shrimp I threw those rite away  And my delivery charge was 5$"}
{"text":"Terrible experience!!!! I asked for delivery and it was just 2 sandwiches and mozzarella sticks. First it took them 1 hour and a half to deliver the food, after what a surprise I order rye bread and it was white, the French fries the worst ones ever, the other sandwich super cold, they put pico de gallo instead salsa marinara for the mozzarella sticks, and the worst part: Yeeeesssss even worst!!!!!! A piece of bone for I don't know what on my sandwich that I almost broke my tooth!!!! They don't even deserve a 1 star but that's the only way I can put a review!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered off uber eats last night!! All 3 of our sandwiches were burnt and we threw them away. Not good at all!! I also paid for strawberry's on my cheesecake and didn't get that!! Very disappointed in this place! I never will order from here again. Just threw my money away!! I would give a 0 if I could!!"}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve one star. I order here last night thru grub hub. Took over a hour to arrive. I ordered chicken wings which came dry no sauce on them so figured whatever ill use my own. Both me and my gf ate them and not more then a hour later We were throwing up our guts and using the toilet. It tasted all rubber it was so nasty that it tasted better coming up. I called up the restaurant to talk to the manager about it and as soon as I did this mother flucker Ivan tells me first thing was contact a lawyer and go to the hospital. No manners no customer service straight up A holes there. Save yourself hours in the bathroom and a huge head ache from another sh't hole..."}
{"text":"This is my second order from Modena.  We ordered two pastas fries and burritos. Late night craving. They delivered fast even though it was close to closing time. Mini burritos were my fav.  The fries were cheap and they are huge! We are having a good meal with portions big enough for a second meal tomorrow! THANK YOU FOR DINNER GUYS!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever experienced.  I spent $40 for food that took over an hour to get to me on top of being cold. I could have made a grilled cheese sandwich for my son much cheaper and it would have been hot for him he didn't even eat it because it was cold. The pizza tasted like it was sitting out for at least 10 to 15 minutes before the driver actually picked it up off the warmer if there even is warmer there. I will never ever ever eat at this disgusting place again! When I called to complain and ask for a manager the guy said there was no manager on duty which I know is a lie because no store whether it be pizza Hut dominos or this cafe Modena whatever it is they should always have a manager for the shift the guy had no customer service skills whatsoever he was extremely rude. Honestly I hope this place goes down the tubes. Oh they also double charged me for delivery. Its called a flare delivery rate! I hope the idiot who I spoke to on the phone reads this and his supervisor sees this review. He told me the manager could be found at the Mandalay bay hotel. Ha! If I could give negative stars I would!"}
{"text":"Have ordered the 14 inch pickup special several times.  Best pizza in the area hands down.  Keep ordering again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent grub spot! I have only gotten delivery from here. But since starting to use Cafe Modena as my go to delivery food joint, everyone I know orders from here too. My friends and I have tried a good portion of the menu, and never have we had a complaint.  The employees are always friendly and in a good mood; delivery service is timely and professional.  They earn their tip and delivery charge. This reviewer suggests you Grab a flick, have your friends over, order a couple pizzas, fingers, maybe some cheddar fries; and savor this delicious little grub spot."}
{"text":"Order a pizza at 9:05 pm, it didn't arrive until 10:23 pm, so it was cold and soggy. The pizza was just like any other bad pizza I've tasted, definitely not worth the wait!   You guessed it.... will never order there again! :("}
