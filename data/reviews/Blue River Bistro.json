{"text":"Had lunch here with some of my co-workers and thought it was great. Pretty diverse menu so we all managed to find something we liked and thought the prices were great. I'd recommend the BLT sandwich for sure. Good option in the beltline area if you work around that area."}
{"text":"There isn't much in the way of coffee spots in Victoria Park short of a Starbucks (hint hint independent coffee shops!), but I did find the Blue River Bistro. Unfortunately, I found them at closing time, which is 4 pm.  The door was unlocked, there were still a couple of people inside, it was 410. I ventured inside. I wanted a bite to eat, but didn't quite know what I wanted. I gazed at the case of salads, pastries and squares and sandwiches, the young man behind the counter asked if if I knew what I wanted. \"No, I can't decide if I want a salad or a brownie,\" I replied. \"Get both,\" he said with a slight smile. So I did.  They stayed open an extra 20 minutes so I could have some time to eat my salad salad and drink my coffee. The salad was a spinach salad with mushrooms, 1/2 a hard boiled egg and tomatoes for $3.77. The spinach leaves were fresh and I got a balsamic vinaigrette on the side. My brownie was actually a turtle brownie. It was just sweet enough to counter my Americano.   Coffee-wise, they serve Seattle's Best.   I found the additional snack counter a little bit of a strange addition. It was off to the side, and looked to sell pop and juice, chocolate bars, chips and the likes. I don't think I would've even noticed it except for the sign behind the main counter telling me cigarettes were available for sale.  At any rate, they had a menu with soups and sandwiches on it as well. This could be an alright spot to grab something on your way by."}
{"text":"I popped into Blue River Bistro last Thursday. It's got new owners and they are so friendly! I had the bourbon chicken on rice with a side salad. It was really good, not too spicy so I added a little Sriracha. It happened to be Chinese New Year and the owner added a cookie to the end of my meal in celebration of the day. Nice touch! Overall the food was good, the cafe was bright and clean and it was really well priced."}
