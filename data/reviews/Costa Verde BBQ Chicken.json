{"text":"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS SHITTY ASS RESTAURANT. On Saturday September 23 I ordered from costa verde via the UberEATS app. We ordered the family combo and an extra side. When our meal arrived we noticed we were missing a side we paid extra for. I called costa verde and told them that they forgot to include part of my order and the man on the phone said \"ok just grab it another time\". I asked him if he could deliver and he responded in a condescending tone of voice \"how am I supposed to do that?\". I said I don't know but you messed up our order so call Uber or drive it over yourself. He said \"no, you place another order and it will get delivered via uber\". I asked to speak to the manager because clearly he wasn't being helpful and then he informs me that he is the manager. This man took NO ACCOUNTABILITY and had the audacity to tell me to order again?! He continues to blame uber and me, THE CUSTOMER. I tell him that I just want a refund and he refused to give me one and told me to call uber. I told him \"why do I have to call them when it was YOUR mess up?\". The least he could have done was call uber and ask them to refund on my behalf since he messed up! The manager goes on to HANG UP on me while I'm still talking! Wow. What kind of business are they running over there? I called uber who refunded me the whole order and took accountability for that stupid manager's behaviour and apologized for that child's manners. What kind of restaurant blames their courier service AND their customer for THEIR MISTAKE?! What a piss poor experience and shitty ass management."}
{"text":"I buy a whole grilled chicken, salad and rice every other Sunday for my family of 5... LOVE IT!!!. The chicken is moist and  their sauce is amazing, their salad is fresh and the rice is well cook and so flavourful. The staff is super friendly and the price is awesome. We always look forward to a delicious meal. 
I highly recommend Costa Verde Chicken!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Portuguese chicken in the city. I would highly recommend it to anyone! The staff is friendly with fast service. Super delicious!!!!!!!

The interior of the restaurant is nice and new - they have multiple big screen tvs should you want to dine in.

They do only accept cash so make sure to bring some - if not, there is an atm next door and inside."}
{"text":"Nice food and great service. 
Chicken is served with lots of rice and potatoes, also a pop. It was worth the price.
I would come back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Never disappointed. The service is always great. The chicken is never dry."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service and friendly staff what more could u ask for!! My husband and I just found out new favourite chicken place!"}
{"text":"I was here during lunch with some of my co-workers as we wanted to try some Portuguese chicken. The website stated that they do carry halal chicken but that is only their rotisserie chicken, alas their machine was down so they didn't have any halal chicken.

So I opt for small Red Snapper fish dinner. The Fish came with rice and potatoes. The fish was solid and the potatoes were very good. The service was very friendly and one of the server even came by to ask if everything was good.

They don't have much seating just 2 small tables of 4. This is more of a grab and go restaurant. Portion size of the food is very appealing.

The parking on the street is paid parking. Overall, Okay visit.

On the Halal front- only their  rotisserie chicken is Halal and the grilled chicken is not."}
{"text":"Says there are open till 8:30pm on Saturdays, I came by at 7:00 and they were closed."}
{"text":"IT'S CLOSED !!! :(:( I went on July 12 2017 and the new owners told me the brothers sold the restaurant because they went back to school :( I forgot what the new name is, but it's not bad. Chicken, rice and potatoes were still decent but not as good compared to the original. It's the end of an era :( it was amazing while it lasted."}
{"text":"Not too bad, but not awesome.. Had a half chicken, rice and potatoes with a pop for $11. The potatoes as others have said we're really good - nice parisian style. Tons of rice that was OK. The chicken was nice and crispy but the beast was very dry, to the point of almost inedible. Had the spicy sauce, which is flavourful and not overpowering."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and each time I get the same thing - the seafood rice, which is basically their version of paella. Man, I like this dish! First of all, it tastes great. But almost as important, is the price - $15, including tax. What a deal! Sure, they use frozen seafood, but $15! And the seafood is large and plentiful - shrimp, clams, mussels, squid, fake crab, scallops, all piled in with some chorizo and flavoured rice. Did I mention it only costs $15?
One day I'll try the rotisserie chicken which smells awesome, but in the meantime, i'm filling up on the rice!"}
{"text":"All I had was the coconut cake. They say it takes two days to make... And I don't doubt it for a second! It tasted amazing! The icing wasn't too heavy and the cake was delicious!!! Definitely worth the trip. Next time I'm trying the ribs!"}
{"text":"Walked into this location not knowing what to expect. 

I remember the old location on eglinton west which was conveniently located by my high school and walking over there and enjoying some potato balls and chicken.

All those feelings hit me back- as soon as I found this spot. Except even better. Eglinton west location is essentially a take out hole in the wall. This location had dining area and a massive open kitchen with a big team of grill-masters working hard to keep the masses fed. On top of that- the PRICES are ridiculously low!

$10 a whole chicken peri peri style. SIGN ME UP!! Tender char burnt chicken with hot sauce. Was done perfectly- its up there with nando's maybe better if they had additional sauces.

Bife a Casa- steak with an egg on top. Take out - 15 minutes later it was still tender and chewy. Magical grill they have there.  

One of these pictures are my left overs that I brought to the office with my the next day. VALUE- TASTE- SERVICE. Costa Verda covers all aspects.

Ou I think I like it!"}
{"text":"I haven't ever dined in, but there is a huge hot food counter to choose from for takeout. We live nearby so this is always a good option for a quick hot meal that is fairly inexpensive. There is always plenty of staff working so your order is taken quickly and you're out the door within minutes.

The location has a nightmare parking lot, so I would suggest you park in the back and walk out front."}
{"text":"I don't order anything but take out chicken. Spicy leg quarters to go. Delicious and fresh. The food never makes it home in one piece. Come here and try it out. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Ordered 5 meals, 4 drinks and small olives, cost us $72. 
Lots of choices at the hot table. Pick one main and two sides. 
The \"bife a Casa\" is a skirt steak with fries and a fried egg.  It was a good cut of steak and could of used some salt/pepper on it, but otherwise was good.  Kids got the fried fish, they really enjoyed it.  Husband got the codfish, but he said it was too mushy. 
The \"favas\" (beans) were really good and tender.  Rice was good too. 

Good seating area but I really didn't like eating in a tin take out container with plastic utensils. Real plates and cutlery would be a HUGE improvement.  

The place was clean and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"In reviewing this place I see there was a Costa Verde that was on Oakwood, near Rogers. I don't know if it's still open and this is another store they opened, or if they closed that one up, but either way recently this place opened up on Eglinton near Keele.

Not much choice for good food in that neighbourhood, so while walking by I noticed how nice, clean and inviting it looked. And the smells coming out of it, hot damn.

So went in one night on a whim, they had tons of meat on the grill, everything smelled great.

I didn't know what to order, size wise, so I ordered a whole chicken + large sized potatoes as a side.

Big mistake. The wife and I couldn't even finish HALF of it, it was huge! But so cheap, only $17 all together, which means next time we go and get half sizes, it'll be less than $10. Insane!

The potatoes are TO DIE FOR OMG, and the chicken was moist, tender, and tasty. The sauce they put on it was great, they'll ask you medium or spicy, go with spicy as it's flavorful but not really spicy at all. It's not the BEST Portugese Churrasqueira style chicken on the planet but it's REALLY good. 

Place was super clean, staff super friendly, I will be going back for sure. 

Note: Take out only, there is no seating."}
{"text":"This place is as impossible to park as it is to make a choice on what to eat. Once you enter you are greeted with rows of rotisserie chicken (like a Swiss Chalet commercial) and neatly tiled pieces of meat and fish on the grill. There are literally tons of stuff being grilled right before your eyes and makes you wonder who is eating all that until you hit the line and realized apparently there are lots.

Everything looked fantastic and I wish I could try them all but of course I had to go with the Portuguese staple of a whole roasted chicken. This stuff is pretty tender and the flavours are decent. I can't say it's the best I've had but it's pretty darn good. I love the hot sauce and I make sure the chicken is well lathered with it. I do wish the chicken was a bit more flavourful though and it lacked that pronounced charred taste that makes it special (no, no burnt but more like a charcoal grill kinda taste). Probably because it wasn't grilled over charcoals like it is traditionally.

I am interested in heading back to try other stuff but I would say 3 stars is fair for now. Stop by if you are hungry because $9 gets you an entire chicken."}
{"text":"Pros:
Very good Portugese Chicken

Cons:
Navigating out of the parking area is tough.

Part 2 of my Portugese Chicken adventure brought me here.  St Matthew's was my first spot and it pretty much set the gold standard.  

I lucked out when I first came here because I accidentally made a turn at the intersection.  Turns out that's the better way to go as it leads you to the back entrance where there's a bigger parking lot.  The front entrance only has a couple of spots and is adjacent to Keele which does not make it easy to get it or out.  Stick with the back entrance for this place.

The back entrance seems to also be the take out entrance.  As soon as you walk in, you're basically met with the take out line as you walk in.  The line moves pretty quickly so you're in and out in no time.  I ordered two whole grilled chickens and was out of there in less than 5 minutes.

The chicken was very good.  Very flavourful and dry at all.  It's not as good as St. Matthew's, but it's up there.  At $12 a chicken, it's the cheapest one I have found to date.  Again, this chicken passes the mother in law test as well so yay!!

My only gripe is getting out of here can be a bit of a headache.  It's right by a major intersection so if you're going against traffic coming out, it can be quite a task to get out of there.

Costa Verde is great place to get your Portugese Chicken fix.  It's not my fav, but you can't go wrong coming here as well."}
{"text":"My favourite grilled chicken is from here. They have the best hot sauce and pork rinds!"}
{"text":"Portions are massive.  Had the grilled pork platter.  Enough for THREE meals.  I could not believe the size of the portion - the waiter told me that these are \"Portuguese portions\".  Regardless, way too much food.  Cut back on the portions and adjust the price-point!

Pork was not bad, seasoning ok, background taste of piri-piri (and I am from South Africa so I know my piri-piri).  It could have been more generously seasoned in my opinion. But for me the most difficult obstacle to truly enjoying this meal was the COPIOUS and I mean COPIOUS amount of oil ...

Expensive.  Too massive a portion.  And I like my food drier, i.e. not too much oil.  And, before I forget, it was a very hot day outside ... AND NO AIR CONDITIONING!  Hello?! For the price you charge for entrees, turn on the a/c!"}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this little restaurant on my way to Humber River Hospital. This place has more parking in the backside of the restaurant. Apparently this place closes up once a year sometime around August.

There are two ways to order here, you could go to the take out area and wait in line, or wait to be seated at a table. 

We decided on eating in and ordered the full rack of ribs with 2 sides of potatoes and rice for $25+tax, and a half chicken with 2 sides of coleslaw and fries for 11+tax. Our server got our order wrong and thought we ordered a half rack of ribs, but that was corrected later, no big deal as we took it home. 

This place is unbelievably hot inside. There is no ventilation! No A/C! It was too uncomfortable trying to enjoy a meal here. The chicken was great (though a bit on the dry side), it had a lot of flavour and the fries were so good! Crispy good. If I were to come back, I would just order take out. The ribs are nothing to really write home about, and even overpriced imo. I would just come here for their chicken.

Also this place is cash only. Boo hoo."}
{"text":"I ordered medium rare beef with a salad and potatoes. Jessica ordered cod with rice and potatoes, and Sedara and Shawna split a half chicken meal with salad, rice, and fries.

What I got was well-done beef with a mountain of potatoes, but no salad. The beef was very dry. The potatoes were okay, I guess. When I complained about the missing salad, they fixed the order, but then billed us for an extra salad!

Jessy's fish was full of bones and so it took her forever to eat. We're giving this place a \"no\"."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken combo makes a good lunch for 10 bucks. You get half a chicken, fries and rice, you can add a bit more fries and rice for a buck or two extra if you want. Not the cheapest in general, but the prices for chicken aren't bad. Haven't tried anything else there, which is a positive for the chicken and the negative for the price of everything else.

Cash only, which is a bit annoying. Also (oddly enough) they'll charge you a dollar if you want to dine in."}
