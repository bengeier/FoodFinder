{"text":"This place has really good food and staff are really friendly. Wasn't expecting much when we went sincr we haven't heard of the restaurant but we were all  extremely surprised by how good the food was. We will definitely be back for sure."}
{"text":"A modern but cozy setting..the bar has this warm dim lighting....just perfect for chilling with friends or  for couples.
The food and service were awesome and the music gives it the perfect vibe! Definitely gonna be my go to pub around here"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times (4 times) and have had excellent service and have been impressed with the local craft beer selection.  We ordered the nachos and it was pretty good-not mind blowing but from what I have seen of the burgers, fish and chips and wings, Billie Jax will be a successor the food front. 
The number of tv's and the amount of and variety of sports being shown was awesome. I watched UEFA, baseball, hockey and tennis - love it!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Whitby,  food and STAFF, are awesome. Most of the food is freshly made to order. Unlike the chain restaurants,  where they serve frozen crap."}
{"text":"A new resto in Whitby! Yessss! In the former location of Hooters, Billie Jax has transformed the location into an open concept, classier sports bar. 

When you walk in, you're almost in the kitchen! The kitchen has no walls and you can see all of the staff working diligently. There is a beautiful bar boasting a great variety of craft beer. They know how to get me! There are many TVs with different channels on, but you can see a screen from almost anywhere.

The menu is not your typical bar menu, it's got a gastropub feel, but they couldn't leave off the pub classics, like fish and chips! Their burgers are fantastic. I tried the Billie Jax burger and the West Coast burger, both super awesome. Regular and sweet potato fries are also quite good. Burgers are served on a brioche bun, so you're not overwhelmed by a ton of bread.

The dessert menu is small, but if you need something sweet, these will do it. We shared the Mocha Ice Cream Cake. A large piece came drizzled with caramel and chocolate and sprinkled with slivered almonds. Very mocha-y. Good stuff!

Service on both my visits were pretty good. I understand they're new, so the staff is also new, but, I'm sure they'll get into a good rhythm. Hostess on my first visit was probably new to hosting, but I'll let her sitting us by a giant party, where our server had trouble getting to us slide. I was a hostess before, I get it.

They've had a strong start! I look forward to future visits!
Keep the good brew coming!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here because I like the environment, the food and drinks, and the service. The owner knows how to run a good restaurant and he leads by example. You can see him helping the workers, greeting customers, clearing tables, etc. The restaurant is very welcoming and open. The place is kept clean and organized. The service is great, and the specials are what keeps me coming back! I love Monday's $8.99 wings & fries special. It's even better with their signature Caesar. I also love their desserts!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check on Billy Jax one Sunday.  We arrived at lunchtime and seated immediately. Was impressed by the environment and the layout. Thanks to seeing the menu with one of the other reviews on Yelp decided to get the fried pickles and then the burger with a garden salad. My wife  had  the Fish and Chips. Overall  rank this is a good restaurant for you to come to for a nice meal wuth family. Service was good looks like it's a family-owned operation and it's very clean and environments very bright and modern"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. Excellent selection of craft beers! The food has been quite good, pub food but good! Have read great reviews for their burgers so want to try that next. Friendly servers, good atmosphere. Great addition to Durham region!"}
{"text":"First visit and won't be my last. Had the quarter chicken dinner and the sauce was great. My sister had the ribs and they were fall of the bone delicious.
Great selection of craft brews.
Loved that the owner got in and helped out."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here. Great service great food. Everyone was super friendly and the atmosphere was really nice. They have a good beer selection, including many craft breweries. The food was really good too. I had the lobster dip to start and had the Billie Jax burger, both really good. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and absolutely fantastic beer. I popped in with an employee of mine for dinner and was happy with the wide range of options on the menu. The food quality and service did not disappoint, and the draft beer tasted very crisp and clean."}
{"text":"If it was possible I would honestly give this restaurants a 6 out of 5 stars after everything me and my family had experienced last weekend at this restaurant. While I'm not originally from the Durham region, my family was given the tip during our brewery tour in Beamsville last weekend to check out this restaurant. I remember the tour guy saying, \"this place makes the best burgers ever\". With that sales pitch in mind we decided why not give it a try then?!

To cut to the chase everything about this restaurant from the freshness and quality of our Burgers (one of the best ones I had in a while!), right down to the appetizers (Calamari & Spinach dip) was superb! Our waiter, god bless his soul (don't remember his name for the life of me) was also amazing. I haven't had service like that in a long time in all honesty. 

All I can say is that I definitely will come back whenever I am back again in the Durham region. Billie Jax you have a group of new fans now - thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Having driven by this place many times, I was quite curious to see how the place was. After reading some reviews on Yelp, decided to head here on Friday night.

As we entered Billie Jack we were promptly greeted by the staff, and even on a busy Friday night we lucked out and got a booth!. After settling in, this place is nicely designed, the noise was a bit much but it was a Friday night.

Our server was great, he was very prompt and courteous throughout the night.

Now to the food...we ordered the calamari appetizer, buffalo chicken strips & Korean beef mains.(pics attached)

The food was good, the calamari was the best. I found the Korean beef to be tough and not tender, possibly just warmed up. Look out for the chillies in this dish! The buffalo chicken strips were nothing special, again just okay. It's ur typical pub kinda food,although you can tell they are trying to be different which is good for Whitby.

I would go again, just to try something else."}
{"text":"Billi Jax is a nice pub with a huge selection of craft beers. If you're a beer drinker, Thursday nights it's $5 for any craft beer. The wings and ribs are both superb. Nice thick cut fries too. Lots of tv's in the place to catch a sports game. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, one of the better beer selections for the area, at least 10 local beers on tap along with about another dozen that you'd expect. Owner is on site and really cares about his service and food. Lots of new, 70 inch, 4K televisions to watch the games. Great spot to meet up with friends."}
