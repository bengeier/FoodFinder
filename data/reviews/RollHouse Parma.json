{"text":"I'm pretty fond of freeway lanes, I live in parma and even though I'm closer to Yorktown, I'd rather take the extra 7 minute drive up Chevrolet and go to freeway lanes. Its a typical bowling alley. But its very clean. The staff make you feel like family when you go in. I usually bowl early with my family so that my son isn't too distracted. Planning on going cosmic bowling eventually, it's been so long since I have done that.  They have food obviously, typical bowling food. But i can't complain about it at all. They even have some specials that I will eventually try, I'll also update my review when I'm able to try them all."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place since I was at least 7 years old.  My coworkers and I decided to stop in last night since we had a free pass. There are a ton of lanes so it doesn't feel crowded and a lot of things to do here besides just bowling. They have pool tables,  a bar, arcade games and food! Mondays at 10:30pm is service industry night and that's when it's really fun! The screens come down, the lights turn off and the music starts!  The place itself is great and I can't wait to make this a regular thing.  The only thing that could improve is the customer service.  The lady that checked us in and the lady at the food counter were so uninterested in talking to us I felt like we were bothering them by needing things.  But the DJ and one of the bartenders were so nice and cool that they made up for them!"}
{"text":"Awesome! We were visiting from Maryland and the food and the experience was great!! Everyone was super nice and courteous!!"}
{"text":"Caught an early bird special on my day off, $9 for unlimited bowling for 2 hours, not a bad deal at all. It was clean inside, staff was helpful. Its also very kid friendly, kids 10 and under  bowl in their own lane for free, just pay for shoes  Typical bowling alley food, fries, chicken fingers, burgers wings, all cooked to death in grease, all sooooo tasty. their wing sauce is great actually.  overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on Saturday and enjoyed our experience there. The lady working the front counter was awesome and really informative. She was also very accommodating when our lane was overrun by unruly children who kept wandering into our lane. If just that, this place would have gotten five stars. My only quarrel was with the bartender, who apparently thinks it is okay to make racist remarks about other patrons to my boyfriend while he is getting drinks for us. That, to me, is unacceptable. Bar service gets 0/5. Bowling attendants get 5/5."}
{"text":"Great place staff  sons birthday  was a success 3-5-16 food very fresh hot clean  in ,out .I recommend  for fun or party!"}
{"text":"Nice place to bowl have deals every night and cosmic bowling is great to friendly staff.. Bartenders are amazing and food is good to"}
{"text":"This bowling alley is as good as any.  Actually, it's probably better than most.  It has a full grill that can serve up some decent food, like tasty corn dogs.  It also has a full bar with cheap beer.  It also has a pool hall with five 8-foot tables.  Pretty nice!  They have cosmic bowling on weekends, which is pretty sweet if I do say so myself.  They have bumpers for the kiddies too.  They also have an updated scoring system that plays videos after your shot.  I busted out laughing several times watching the videos.  It was like watching Amercia's Funnest Home Videos with no sound.  They were cool.  The scoring system is cool, but it takes a minute to figure out which buttons to push (up and down) to enter your names.  The best part is the flat panel TVs used for displaying videos and your score.  Even better, right next to the score TV is a real TV playing sports, which guys love.    Like all bowling alleys, this place is large and can accommodate a big group of friends who just want to have some drinks and chuck some heavy spheres at some oblong bottles at the end of a narrow, slippery wooden avenue.  Oh, and get this.  We treated everyone to two games of bowling, twelve people in all.  We paid for their shoes too.  Guess how much!  Thirty bucks, lol!  That was a steal.  Think the guy behind the counter failed basic math.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Shout out to Carol and the entire staff at Freeway in Brookpark!  Each year they host our annual bowling tourney in June and do a fantastic job!!  From the lanes, to the snack shop, to the bar - it's what a bowling alley should be!"}
{"text":"The bowling itself is fun. Cosmic bowling was set to good music and I had a fun evening. The lane was remodeled recently enough, but the place could be run so much better.   I showed up at 9:15pm on a Friday night and there were about 15 customers standing in the lobby doing nothing. Cosmic bowling does not start till 9:30pm, but why a business would want potentially paying customers standing around not allowed to buy anything is mind boggling. If you don't want to turn on the lanes till 9:30pm that is fine but at least start processing payments so people can set up and get drinks and order food, etc...   At 9:30pm a lady started accepting everyone's money - $15 for an hour for one person including shoes. You then proceeded to another employee who assigned lanes and handed out the shoes.   By the time I left after 2 and a half games, the place was full. To start out there were only 5 separate groups however, but we were all placed on adjacent lanes. If you have 42 lanes, why would you bunch 5 parties up at lanes 1-5. Put them at 1, 3, 5, etc so everyone can be efficient about getting started since there is only one control device for every two lanes so only one party can enter names at one time.   Nice enough place and I would go back if I wanted a lower key bowling experience than the new downtown places offer, but don't show up early."}
