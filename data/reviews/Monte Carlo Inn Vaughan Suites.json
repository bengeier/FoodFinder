{"text":"just really bad. look elsewhere.  had someone come to my door at 230 in the morning, claiming i was in the wrong room. when in fact the front staff screwed up, and that person was supposed to be at another monte carlo inn. worst experience ever, and never going back!!!!"}
{"text":"The check in staff are awesome, very friendly and efficient. The room we had was spacious, clean and well looked after. The location of the hotel is conveniently located within a five minute drive to the Vaughn mills mall."}
{"text":"When after work drinks turned into dinner and dinner turned into after dinner drinks, I decided it proper that I cab it to the closest hotel for the evening rather than the alternative. Being in Woodbridge at the time (and not wanting to pay Hilton prices) I was brought to the closest spot, the Monte Carlo Inn.  Located near Jane and Hwy 7, its set back and sort of hidden from view on the main roads. However, don't despair if you search turns up empty, look for the Walmart (hard to miss those) and its located conveniently behind it ( I assume for all those exhausting last minute Walmart shopping sprees - they can be tiring :p).  Don't be discouraged by the term \"Inn\", which to most folks comes with the image of a pull up and park, pay the hour place, with a neon \"(No) Vacancy\" sign out front. Au Contrair. In my modest personal opinion I would give this a solid 3 star hotel rating (yes a hotel - looks just like one). Its clean, the bed is comfortable, the staff are professional and they have a wonderful little resto/bar on the main floor which serves up complimentary breakfast to all guests.  The decor is modest but tasteful in each room - very simple fixtures, but heck for $99 a night what a deal! Its also located within walking distance of a many amenities should your stay be for longer than one evenings. Also for all you 905 club hoppers, this place is only a 10-15 minute stumble from the AMC theater complex in Vaughan which is home to several great night spots (Dueling Pianos, Berlin Nightclub, Ivy nightclub, Luxy Nightclub, Yuk Yuk's).   I enjoyed my stay here and so will you, look them up if and when you are in town.  X-FACTOR: Monte Carlo has BEAUTIFUL Jacuzzi suites. Very romantic for those local little Trysts, and if your one night stand develops into a life long one, no worries friend, have a peak at the Honeymoon suite :) Shockingly elegant for a place INN the middle of no where. (whomp whomp whomp)."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy there, but clean rooms and polite staff. I stayed there for a wedding and was flying out at the end of the afternoon. I was granted a late checkout for free which I really appreciated. Would definitely go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Worst hotel EVER. Noisy. Could hear the people in the next room doing the nasty. For 2 hours. The woman sounded happy. The hallway at 2:30 was noisy. In the morning. When the room was made up, they left the USED cup from the night before, with water still in it!!     The on site restaurant was the absolute worst food I've eaten. And there's nothing close so it's your only choice. The complimentary breakfast was terrible. Bad service. Bad food.   I would NEVER stay here. Ever."}
{"text":"The staff welcomed me as I walked in the door.  Check in was swift and  made a point to engage a pleasant conversation with me.  He was very professional and friendly.  They offer free continental breakfast which includes basic breads, bagels and rolls.  They also offer hot oatmeal which is very well prepared.  Fresh fruit and cereals are available.  Monte Carlo has many locations l.  I will definitely considering staying with the chain when I travel."}
{"text":"Tacky, tacky, tacky!! The room we were given must have been decorated by a pimp. The ceilings were of cheap stipple drywall. Red colour splashes everything, and a tacky jacuzzi in the room! Everything about this place make you want to take a shower and run. We were too tired to leave. Breakfast was cheap and disgusting! They hired people who hardly speak English and have the elegance of armadillos. If you must be in Vaughan, go anywhere else but this place!"}
{"text":"The room was great the staff were friendly and amazing.  My only complaint was the free breakfast only included : toast , bagels , muffins and fruit - which had visibly been sitting there since breakfast opened.  For someone who cannot eat gluten , this surely didn't work.    Otherwise , we will be back !!"}
{"text":"I liked the fountain in the front of the Monte Carlo Inn. Although the place looks old, it added a nice fancy touch to the place. When we walked in the Inn, we were cramped into a tiny lobby with a few couches. We ended up standing and waiting after the two ladies working at the desk took care of each customer. Neither of the staff working at the front desk were welcoming. Honestly it felt like we, the customers, were being a drag and wasting THEIR day. If it had not been for our reservation, I would have up and left as I don't tolerate horrible customer service.   The room was nice and spacious with a coffee table and two chairs on the side. We also had a desk, another chair, and two beds. A television, dresser, fridge, coffee maker, hair dryer and microwave were provided as well. The room itself was nice, and the cleaning lady who cleaned our room every day did an excellent job, which is why I am giving two stars.   Breakfast was from 6-10 am, and you were able to choose from apple strudels, danish pastries, croissants, cereal such as frosted/corn flakes, rice krispies, and cheerios. Fruit such as honeydew, canaloupe, and pineapple were available. Orange juice, hot water, and milk, as well as toast, muffins, jam, and butter were there. Unfortunately if you wanted eggs, sausage, and/or bacon you had to pay extra for it.   Every single day we stayed at Monte Carlo, each lady working at the front desk was rude and unwelcoming. None of them had smiles on their faces, so it was obvious that they all hated their jobs. The lady at the front desk we had to deal with was Pam, and sadly, I think she was in charge of all of them as her badge had extra print written under her name. I don't recommend coming here unless you don't mind talking to rude and unhappy people or you don't mind if your vacation is ruined."}
{"text":"Staff was rude. Wouldn't go back. Hotel room was clean. Not worth the money.  Old and smells!!!"}
