{"text":"Gotham's bagels are up there with any of the top places that coasties or bagel lovers could name. Excited for them to have expanded to Sun Prairie with this concept."}
{"text":"Just opened this week. Probably have a few kinks to work out as any new restaurant does but staff was friendly, energetic, & cared about their product. Got the hot turkey fontina on honey wheat bagel.  opted for stone  ground mustard instead of mayo. Was missing the onion but the cheese had a nice grilled edge & turkey thick with good flavor. Hoped it would be warmer since it was a HOT sandwich but I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went there today and had the sausage egg and cheese, it was amazing. So happy to see more businesses give Sun Prairie some food diversity."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good.  And that's the food itself.  We sampled 2 sandwiches and the soup, all of which I would give a hearty 5 stars.  Very tasty and would not hesitate to eat any of it again.  Classic sandwiches that were indeed delicious.  And some bagel crisps that were also very tasty - first time I had seen a thin slice of an entire bagel.  Way to go.  The bad?  The service.  They completely forgot our soup and it was served after the sandwiches.  The other bad?  The cleanliness.  Every table in the place was dirty.  None of them were cleaned between people coming and going.  To make it worse, we watched one of the staff members goofing off on her phone and talking to friends staring at a dining room of dirty tables.  I think the staff needs more \"adults\" as the only ones I saw appeared to be teenagers. I'll go back, but likely get my next sandwich to go."}
{"text":"First time having a sandwich from Gotham. I had the Brooklyn Bomber. It was quite good. I'm sure you wont be disappointed if you get it.   I'll try again soon. 4 stars may turn to 5."}
{"text":"One word... PASTRAMI!!  I had warm pastrami on an everything bagel. Amazing.     Great staff, especially Sherman who is clearly passionate about what he's doing.    The past salad was as unique as it was delicious. The house pickles are great too.    Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and the sandwiches are delicious. I love seeing what the special is or what the latest creation is.  They are very accommodating and friendly.  I typically get a salt bagel - and haven't had a great salt bagel other than in New York but this one is spot on.  Their cream cheeses have a great texture and flavor.  I've been multiple times to this location and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Have heard good things about this place so we made a trip over this morning, only to find that a BAGEL place is CLOSED on SUNDAYS?"}
{"text":"Best bagels I've ever had. I got a breakfast bagel and the egg was cooked perfectly. My husband got the pastrami, which was also the best pastrami we've had. The bagels have a great amount of flavor to compliment the sandwich. Staff was very helpful and fun. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was a regular for 5 years at a different coffee shop in Sun Prairie. They slowly took every single thing that I bought off the menu. So, decided to try another place. Gotham's food, service, and coffee are amazing. They are definitely my new permanent spot."}
{"text":"I stopped by this new little restaurant for the first time today. I know they have another location downtown but I've never had a chance to get down there so I don't know if they are similar or not.   I went in around lunch time on a weekday and was pleasantly surprised with the amount of people that were there. Some families were having lunch along with a few just enjoying some coffee. The eating area is fairly small, there is one big table that would easily fit 8-10 people as well as 3 other four person tables. I ended up getting my order to-go. I opted to have the house roasted turkey on a garlic bagel. The food was delicious and I savored every bite. SO good. However, the price is higher than I would like. My sandwich was $8 which I found a little ridiculous because all you get is the sandwich, whereas usually I would expect a drink or side for that.   The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. While I was waiting for my food I watched staff go around and chat with customers and make sure everything was tasting okay.  I will probably be back if I have some extra money to splurge on a nice lunch but it won't be something that happens often. I am glad to see a new business come to Sun Prairie and I'm eager to try out some of their other menu items!"}
{"text":"I like these guys. Their breakfast has big bold flavors! Bagels are their staple and they have many flavors to choose from. We got a couple bacon, egg, and cheese. The egg was nice and runny. The cheese was fully melted. The bacon was thick cut. It seemed fresh and local. We got a couple lattes to go with it. They took a little while to come out but they tasted good when they did. The bagels are served with toasted bagel crisps and a pickel on the side. Strong flavors on everything."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast and lunch spot during the week!    The sandwiches are wonderful and the daily soup never disappoints. My office loves the NY Dozen Bagel variety, they're gone fast.  PLEASE open up on Sunday!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot lately. The food is great, and you can tell they are using \"real\" ingredients! Seating is limited, but I haven't experienced a problem with it so far."}
