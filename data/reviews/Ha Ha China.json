{"text":"I've written some reviews before, but they've always been positive.  That's not the case with this one.  We had take-out, so I can't speak to the level of service, but the food (sesame chicken, happy family, pork-fried rice) was less than mediocre -- tasteless, oily  and pricey.  We won't be giving it a second chance!"}
{"text":"Just ate here since they re-opened.  Under new management. Food was wonderful.  Service was great!  If not on menu -- ask -- they will most likely make it.  Not much available for chinese food here in Fountain Hills and this is a nice change.  Not sure what happened with previous customers as it looks like they had a bad experience. It's too bad as we had different experience.  If not happy let them know as they will try to make it right.  Try them as I am sure you will enjoy."}
{"text":"OUT OF BUSINESS - new business in this location: Hao Asian Fusion.  (Original review) We're new full-timers to the area, trying the local restaurants. Came in near the end of their lunch time which finishes at 2:30.  Very friendly reception. Very respectable meals which we enjoyed. Lunch prices outstanding - I had the Kung Pao Chicken. Came with an egg roll, egg-fried rice and the entree, nice lunch sized portion, all for about $7 (one pays that much for fast food these days!)  The food's very good, perhaps not as good as Flo's in Scottsdale if you're familiar, but then it's much more reasonable, quiet and friendly.  Also, had some nice chats with a woman I took to be the owner. A good experience overall.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Recently ate here, takeout, and was very pleased with food.  The orange chicken was slightly spicy and still crunchy, the brown rice was very yummy and the crab puffs have actual crab in the cream cheese - unassuming building but spectacular food."}
{"text":"This place reopened under new management/ ownership after being closed for over a year. Never been in old place but new is not worth of visiting. Me and my wife ordered different dishes and both had same thing in common; were terrible over salted - on verge of uneatable they also did not seam to be made freshly. Also staple of my every visit to Chinese restaurant- crab rangoons- were worst I have ever ate- not fresh and very dry. As the Fountain Hills resident I always try to support local businesses but this place is not worth spending money and salt levels will give you high blood pressure."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service. Very accomodating w special requests (vegan). Great egg rolls that are actually home made and hand rolled not the usual frozen sysco fare most places serve.  The food was all delicious and service was impeccable.  Very prompt and extremely polite servers.  Food was prepared quickly but at a comfortable pace, we did not feel rushed."}
