{"text":"We just recently discovered this place and I just wish we have discovered it sooner!

The hot dogs are to die for! They are perfectly snappy with all the traditional Chicago fixin's on poppy seed bun. Yum!

I love the fries which are served in generous sized portions and always come out so hot, fresh, and crisp! 

The Italian Beef is a heck of a sandwich with tender meat, lots of peppers, delicious bread, and au jus!

My girls and I are huge fans of their sliders. Not quite up to the standard of my absolute favorite White Castles but still very tasty!"}
{"text":"Italian beef, wet with hot peppers. 

Bliss."}
{"text":"People that live out here in Glendale must have some pretty substandards. This place is horrible, the sliders are pathetic and compared to Chicago Hamburger on 40th and Indian School, these are total crap. Their fried zucchini was out of a frozen plastic bag, obviously not fresh. I don't like to trash a place after only one time going there but this place is awful. 

The inside of this place is depressing as hell too! Just a bunch of new hot dogs advertisement signs and ugly mcdonalds yellow and red walls. This place is an epic failure and should shut down and try again. Also I only had two sliders and a few zucchini sticks and I feel sick to my stomach, any other place I can handle about 4 sliders and a large side with no problem so that has to say something."}
{"text":"This is well outside our normal stomping ground, but we stomped in while in the area based on Yelp reviews and were not disappointed.  We did not eat anything remotely health, but everything was spectacularly tasty.  

Big loaded hot dogs and tasty Italian Beef... it's a good thing I don't live in Chicago (or near Boomer's) or I'd be in deep (fried) trouble."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. I was born in Chicago, but was raised pretty much in Phoenix, but my family always talks about Chicago Hot Dogs, Italian Beef, you name it. Since I haven't been to Chicago as an adult, I figured checking out the local Chicago-ish places will have to do (for now at least)
I brought my Grandma who lived in Chicago for many years and she gave this place a stamp of approval too. She ordered the Italian Beef and it was scrumptious.  
I ordered the Chicago Dog and a basket of fried zuchinni and it was divine.
I would have ordered two more Chicago Dogs if I would have worn my \"fat pants\" that day. (Mental Note for next time)

Customer Service- very friendly
Prices- very affordable

And they have specials- .50 cent sliders on Fridays and .30 cent wings on Wednesdays. 

YUMMYYYYYY."}
{"text":"this place is awesome...everything on the menu is delicious and the people are cool and down to earth...there pulled pork sandwich was really good and there pizza pockets are to die for...ill have like 4 of them as a snack before getting the bomber(chicago styled hot dog with everything on it... only its a foot long)go ther on fridays and its $.50 slider day...get like 10 sliders and some of there bomb ass chili cheese fries and your good...I have sent many people over there and they loved it"}
{"text":"The one thing keeping this place from getting 5 stars?  Steam the facking buns for chrissakes.  If the slider meat would have been cooked fresh and buns steamed would have been a great meal.  But a cold slider bun sucks ass..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never knew about a place that is a mere five minutes away from me, in a complex that I shop at frequently, until earlier today.  I found all the reviews from here very tempting, and so too were the prices.  

I ordered a Chicago dog and two cheese sliders, both with everything on them.  The dog was THE BEST Chicago dog I've had in Arizona, and I've lived here for 22 years.  However, the hot dog was not the pinnacle of my meal.  The cheese sliders were A-MAZING.  The best I've ever had...anywhere.  They were slightly bigger than I expected, but I wished I had ordered more when I was done with them.

I took advantage of their take-out, since I dined alone, but the actual dining area is a lot bigger than one would think by looking at it from the outside.  Lot's of Chicago memorabilia and pictures add to the atmosphere.  My favorite piece was a poster that had a hot dog rated \"NK-17\" (No ketchup unless under the age of 17).  That's just beautiful.

To sum up: Good place to dine-in or take-out, best dogs in Arizona and possibly the best sliders anywhere.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Aside from the girl behind the counter being rude to us.. then our sliders not having cheese on them as ordered and paid for... it was a delight to watch the owner berate her in front of us when we brought the sliders back in and asked for the cheese we paid for! However, once we got the sliders back to my friends house we were both very disappointed that the sliders were completely unseasoned and lacked that delicious salty slider taste that were accustomed too. 

I also order a loaded Chicago Dog which I ate almost immediately, soggy wet mess, yes made by the same girl.. you know, it only takes one bad employee to ruin an experience forever. Will probably not return as I made a special trip to check this place out after so many favorable reviews. 

I'm still so very disappointed, love sliders."}
{"text":"OK so my next time here was better. Granted I could have had a baby in between my visits. (9 months) 

I took the lil' one with me for a burger. She had the kids meal which is a slider and frys and drink. She liked the slider but wanted more cheese. She also laughed at the \"little bit of mustard\" Seriously it was a dot.... 

I had the 2/3lb Cheddar burger. It was good BUT If your customer asks if the burgers are frozen and premade or fresh and handmade you might explain that the 2/3 is actually 2x 1/3 patties. IT IS A DOUBLE 

I prefer burgers cooked med rare on open flame, a 2/3lb would be a nice thick burger.....well not if it is 2 x 1/3 Right? 

They were cooked well done but still had a decent amount of flavor. The toppings were sparse, one small tomato and two small pieces of lettuce. The cheddar spread was good but did not have enough to taste it over the two patties. The bun was good. 

The frys were good, a little under cooked but I happen to like it that way. 

The staff was pleasant but the server should ask if you need anything before dropping the plates and running to hide behind the counter again. (I needed to ask for additional mustard) 

IMHO...you could be a 5 star by adding a little more customer service and adding a little flare to the food. 

See you in March...."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is going to be a hit when people learn about it.  I found Boomers when I was driving around one evening.  It was closed, but I liked the the pictures of the food in the window and the cartoon dog on their logo.

I took my family there yesterday to eat for lunch.  I expected more people to be there, but it wasn't very busy.  The lady behind the counter was the daughter of the chef, so it's a family business which I like.

 My wife had the fish sliders, and my daughter and I had the cheese sliders.   We also had fries.  They have a lot of food on the menu, so next time I want to try something different.  Maybe I'll try the sandwich Mike D. had"}
{"text":"I was having a hard core burger and fry craving for a few days and decided to give in to the temptation and look up a good burger place. I am so glad I found Boomers! I decided to get a bacon cheese burger, and the hubby got a good 'ol double cheese burger. I have never had a slider but I have really been diggin onions lately, so I wanted to try one. Of course I got the combo for the fries. I had to order it to go cause the hubby wasn't feelin so well, so I got the food and got in the car and the car was instantly filled with french fry and burger goodness, I couldn't wait to the ten minute drive home, so I tried a slider. Holy Moly it was freakin amazing!!!! The fries were very good also. We got home and I dug into my huge burger and it was good, but a little over cooked for my liking. I think I will stick with the sliders and fries, but I won't hesitate to order a burger again, I will just make sure to ask them not to char so much next time. The hubby said his was awesome. 

Great burger spot for sure!"}
{"text":"I just found Boomer's Sweet Home Chicago closed. There were papers on the door saying that the property had been seized by the landlord for non payment of rent. How sad."}
{"text":"I don't like giving reviews like this but both times I was there,my cook was on his cell phone while making my food and the server/cashier seemed like she didn't want to be there. I lived in Chicago for 25 years and there beef...espeically there BIG BEEF is not what a beef should be. My wife ordered the regular beef and I ordered the Big beef and when both sandwiches came to our dirty table,We couldn't tell which one was which. So I called the cook back to the table and he explained to me that Big Beef had extra meat in there but It was\"sunken\" in the bread. Go figure!!   Anyway,that is not how a beef should look like and taste like especially from Chicago.  As a side note, there digital menu's are cool but you can hardley read it. I had to use a to go menu to order."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place so much it gives me happy feet!
I was looking for a burger place that wasn't fast food near my house one day & stumbled upon this tasty establishment. I walked in to see a very clean & very inviting dining room. They have a wide range of foods from hamburgers, wings, fried zuchini, cheese fries, & so much more. They just recently added steakburgers which I can't wait to try. The bacon cheeseburger is so good it makes my stomach smile. Maybe I'm crushing so hard on this place because I just ate there tonight but do yourself a favor & eat here if your around 91st ave & Thomas. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"in town for the Cubbies games, My aunt recommed this place. Im glad she did. I got an Italian Beef with sweet peppers, wet. It was very good, almost as good as Portillos.
Ill go back for sure when we are in town"}
{"text":"Came here recently on a Friday afternoon for the first time to check out the place...and to fill my hunger.  When ordering I was informed that \"sliders\" were 50 cents or 65 cents with cheese.  So I tried a few sliders with cheese since it was cheap and who doesn't like these tasty little creations of joy anyway?  I have to admit I liked the food that I got.   The service was attentive and asked me how everything was.  
And of course with the name \"Chicago\" in it there was plenty of decor representing the city.  I will be back and if others want to feel like they are in the windy city I suggest stopping by."}
{"text":"Cheese steak missed flavor and was dry. Wings were no good. Prices were ok, service was par."}
{"text":"Had to sit on the White Sox side...

The owner was extremely laid back and friendly, and had a great sense of humor.  He played host and server all at once and treated everyone like friends and family.

Sliders with Cheese -
I wish the cheese was a little bigger, it was about a inch square in size.  It was like a doll blanket draped over Andre the Giant.  The meat was juicy and three sliders were plenty of food.

Chicago Style Dog -
Plenty of celery salt.

Tamale Boat (aka the Belly Bomb)
Gross but Oh So Yum drenched in chili, cheese, and onion.

The \"Zero calorie\" (so says the owner) cheesecake on a stick would have been better a little less frozen, but that's not his fault.  He even came out of the kitchen with a gigantic chef's knife to help cut the frozen treat.

Great place to go for authentic Chicago fare even if you're not a Sox or Cubs fan. I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Green river soda pop, fried mushrooms, and all of the typical Chicago favorites such as Red Hots and other miscellaneous hot dogs are served up here.  I lean towards fried appetizers at places like this and they were just alright.  Service was somewhat slow and I miss the old pizza place that was in this location beforehand."}
