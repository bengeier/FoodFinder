{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this restaurant a few times, and the food was excellent, and delivered promptly. My orders so far have included dosas, curries, some dal and some kothu roti. The delivery people are very nice too. There are dishes from Northern and Southern India, vegetarian and meat. The spice palate seems a bit on the Southern/Sri Lankan side, even with the Northern dishes. I think they use the kari leaf. Their sambal/sambar are excellent too. YOu can tell that all the food is fresh, and that they care about making sure the textures don't get soggy from sitting around before the food is delivered. Why not 5 stars? Simply because I haven't visited the location itself yet!"}
{"text":"O.M.G.  Only Mouthwatering Goodness served up at this establishment! On a whim, driving by the corner restaurant for the umpteenth time, I nonchalantly said to my husband \"that place makes a butter chicken poutine.\" Although I had an elaborate dinner waiting for us at home, we knew we weren't driving away empty-handed. I didn't know where to place my expectations - but suffice it to say they were all exceeded. The sauce had a tinge of spiciness to it, and the Indi-bec fusion was a field day for my taste-buds. The fries on their own were fine and the cheese could have been doled out a little more generously but to criticize it is akin to the princess complaining about the pea. It was pure,heaven. The onion Baji - a must-have with every new Indian find - was a hit. Texture, flavor and spice levels were on point. Today I was back for a 2nd time in three days.I was just feeling a little peckish so I stuck to the appetizers. Baji - again, soup and pakoras. Hit. Major Hit- and Hit. I am a certified soup nut and the soup just hit all the right notes - pureed, fresh garlic, full rich flavor, perfectly salted and seasoned and piping hot... with a hint of fresh coriander. The type of soup a nut like me says \"I could live off of this\" after the first slurp. I can't wait to try this place again and I'm quite shocked to find so few reviews about this small, tucked away treasure. Just when you think of St-Laurent as a culinary let-down, along comes this discovery."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall! It has amazing food I loved their biryani! I was in a rush on the way to work and I decided to get something quick and the nice man said he'll only take 5 minutes and asked me to time him. To be honest I would have settled for pre cooked food heated up but he went to the kitchen and everything was bustling! Long story short he whipped me up some nice hot biryani full of flavor in 6 minutes and I don't think I'm going to eat anywhere else hehe"}
{"text":"I ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka and naan. The butter chicken was yellow and oversweet (I tasted honey more than anything else).

Chicken tikka was unfortunatly cold and hard to eat ( was it frozen?!)

Naan was small but ok.

I would not recommend the place."}
{"text":"I've been test driving a number of delivery options for work in Ville St Laurent and have been finding decent Indian delivery particularly difficult. I wouldn't go out of the way for this place, but I'll definitely be reordering.

The bad: The naan. I would be shocked if this was never frozen, and would have a heartbreak if someone actually made this from scratch in the restaurant as it comes across as grocery store frozen/microwaved naan... but not as good.

The ok: The tandoori chicken, so bright and looking delicious; fell flat on flavor, but for the price I can't say it was bad as it fit the bill. Didn't like that their JustEat menu didn't include a bunch of the things that they deliver based on the pamphlet that came with my order, but I can also understand them trying to limit reorders with JustEat since they pinch a piece of the pie.

The good: The lamb curry had a good taste to it, not spicy, but a well balanced kick of flavor. Overall I overpaid for what I got, but only by a little bit and because I'm frugal. Moving forward I know what more to order to get a better bang for my buck.

Authentic? Not really. Based on the area I can understand that they might have been forced to Westernize their dishes, but would have been better if it were traditional. When the naan isn't even made on site you're unlikely to get much else thats made with love."}
{"text":"For the last 4 years, we've been on a hunt for a great Indian restaurant. We all finally agree on Raja, it's a great place for take outs and for amazing tasting food for an incredible price deal. Having tried many different Indian Cuisines in Dubai, Bahrain, Ottawa and Montreal, this one is our favourite. You're invited to indulge in a great South Indian Cuisine."}
