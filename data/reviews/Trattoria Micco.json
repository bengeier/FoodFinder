{"text":"Great little place with fresh food and good service.  The owner is usually on location and is always consistently good."}
{"text":"When we aren't up for cooking, this is our favourite spot for grabbing delicious, healthy, fast take-out. 
I love the empanadas - even get a few extra for next day lunches. The meatballs are perfection (sometimes we just get a ton of meatballs and cook pasta at home) and the pizza is incredible."}
{"text":"The food is delicious - from croissants and coffee to meatballs with wonderful tomato sauce, lasagna, salads etc...and Josie is their greatest asset - wonderful smile and big warm heart!
The relaxed neighbourhood atmosphere is also very pleasant - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic desserts, reasonable prices, friendly staff!!! What more could you want in a place? We have only been once but we lived it. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place has won me over and over again. From the home made sandwiches to the meatballs and arrabiata,not to mention gnocchi and all sorts of other Italian comfort staples and deserts. Not really a place to sit and eat, rather a place to pick up and go. One tip, order a tray of lasagna ahead of time for your next gathering. My local favorite."}
{"text":"3$ tax in for a 12oz delicious latte is the main reason I stop there pretty much 5 times a week... also the meatballs are so delicious I end up buying them once a week. Love the staff and the owner is so friendly."}
{"text":"I had two biz meets there so far. G8 atmosphere with superb coffee. Price was fair. Lots of parking on westminister and free municipal parking lot around the corner ."}
{"text":"Great little place. The owner makes fantastic lattes. I enjoy their cupcakes. I've been there many times and have tried just about everything. They started offering pizza, Italian style and it's good. They are famous for their spicy chicken sandwiches and tortellini."}
{"text":"Go everyday for a capp and a pastry. Great meals ready to go if you need a quick dinner. I love almost everything they make."}
