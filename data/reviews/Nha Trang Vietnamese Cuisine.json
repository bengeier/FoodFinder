{"text":"Nha Trang is my absolute favourite Vietnamese restaurant (and I've been to many!). The restaurant itself is very open and spacious, not to mention clean and organized, and has a great atmosphere. The servers are very friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.

 My family goes to Nha Trang so often that the servers remember all of our orders- an impressive feat since each of us has a number of specific alterations and substitutions we want made to our dishes. As soon as we walk in the door, the servers greet us, ask \"The usual?\" and then proceed to bring us our perfectly prepared dishes, as well as our preferred drinks and appetizers. The food is consistently well prepared, and I have never been unsatisfied with the quality of my meal. 

I usually get a vermicelli/tofu stir fry dish (#38) and it is absolutely delicious. It is a light dish that does not leave you feeling heavy or over-full, but still manages to pack in loads of amazing flavour in every bite. The soups at Nha Trang are wonderful as well, and my family always enjoys their fresh salad rolls, served with a creamy peanut sauce.

Nha Trang is an absolute must-try if you are in the area, and visitors can expect great food, great service, and a great venue, all for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I can't really comment on the pricing here, as I don't consider a dish 'expensive' at $10-$12, even if it's $2 more than what's average in this city. If you're going for a Vietnamese meal, you can always expect it to be $13 and under, so I don't pay much attention to price, rather taste and quality.

I enjoy coming here because it's one of the few Vietnamese restaurants in the area (at least from what I know). I think the portion sizes are just right. I've tried the Pho, Lemongrass chicken, and grilled shrimp on different occasions. The food is never greasy, and the bowl comes with a lot of lettuce and sprouts (which I enjoy)."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. Service was good. Cleanliness was excellent. Overpriced. I tried it three different times. Quality of food was a disappointment each time."}
{"text":"I eat here more than I'd like to admit. Have I gone here 4 times in one week? I will not confirm or deny that lol
That being said, it's quite busy all the time so I can't be the only one who enjoys eating here.

The traditional dishes are offered here (stir fry with rice, spring rolls with vermicelli and the like) but my go to is their Bun Bo Hue - do I dare say it almost tastes as good as my mom's? 

The restaurant itself is clean, the staff are accommodating and the food is decent, so that's why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this Vietnamese food. We selected some dishes that had plenty of flavour and spice. The soup was made well and the lemon grass provided some great flavours. 

Tip: Their large is pretty large so make sure you have an appetite.

The Vietnamese vermicelli bowl was really good with spring rolls and pork.  Some places over cook their meat but i was happily satisfied with a well balanced dish.

I would come back and try some other dishes to expand my horizon."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my dish, but I tried something different. I should have stuck with the lemongrass chicken so that I could compare.  I don't think I'll give it another shot though, unless I'm in the neighbourhood and starving..."}
{"text":"A co-worker took me to this restaurant for the first time. I liked it a lot.
Very fast and friendly service. tasty food in good size portions. clean and comfortable restaurant. Definitely will visit again some day.
Go there if you want to be in and out in a reasonable time during lunch."}
{"text":"Not so good. We really wanted to like it due to its location. (close to home and not a ton of other choices up here)
1 star for cleanliness. It was brighter and cleaner than most, newer and not a hole in the wall type place. Instead of music though, you will hear the hockey game but the TV is showing a basketball game.  ? 
Decor is 80's style table and chairs, artwork.
Service is so-so. Come in (if you choose to) and seat yourself. You will wait a long time in a not so busy place for your food and forever for the bill. We went and got the bill for ourselves at the cash. NOT typical of quick in and out Vietnamese places where a speedy meal is often appreciated.
We asked what they specialized in making and staff recommended the 3 satay pho items. Sold. Staff always knows best right? I ordered the seafood satay and hubby got the chicken satay.
Tea was good, loose leaf and costs extra at this restaurant unlike many that offer it free of charge. No biggie.
The satay dishes were greasy and I was surprised, this was unusual for me to find this so. The shrimps were soft and not well cleaned. Ick. No scallops, odd. The noodles were of various widths. 
The chicken was actually nicely done, tender.
Both hubby and I did not feel 100% upon leaving and that is how we know we could have had a better meal. 
$23 before tip for 2 x pho (L) and a small pot of tea."}

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

As some people may have noticed in Calgary, there is an overabundance of Vietnamese Restaurants, and I gave this a 1 star because there are much better places in Calgary to eat at for a cheaper price. Nha Trang in Panatella is overpriced for the quality of food you are getting and portion size. Their prices are equivalent to something you would find in downtown Calgary. 

My bf and I were planning on visiting the new bubble tea place, Ten Ren's Tea Time in Panatella but opted for Vietnamese for a real meal. The place is very spacious and upscale compared to most Vietnamese restaurants; black tiled floors and tan walls. There are large murals painted on the walls, and there are plenty of tables and booths to sit in. Despite this, I find their mismatched furniture odd. The service was decent; nothing to complain about. 

We started out with a couple imported beers which is fairly cheap compared to what other places charge for beer (around $4/bottle). The first thing that came out of my bf's mouth was how expensive the pho was seeing as how we've eaten cheaper. He ordered the small Nha Trang Deluxe Beef noodle soup (rare cooked beef, brisket, tendon, tripe and beef ball $8.75 (S), $9.75 (L)) and I ordered the small Rare Cooked beef Noodle soup ($8.25 (S), $9.25 (L)). The portion size isn't very big (about a 8in diameter bowl), but was enough to fill us up for the time being. The soup base was pretty bland. I tasted a hint of star anise, but that was about it. My beef was shredded (instead of sliced like every other place I been too) and a little tough. 

As for the other items on the menu, your expecting to pay around $7+ for an appetizer, $10 for other soups, $11+ for vermicelli bowl, and $12+ for rice dishes. 

Overall, I don't recommend anyone coming here. It is overpriced and the food is not that great."}
{"text":"Having recently moved up to the area - I went in here on a Saturday mid afternoon for lunch. Being vegetarian I thought I would go for a tofu dish. My friend and I had  vermicelli noodles with vegetables - I had the tofu and veggies, he had chicken and veggies. We both thought it was excellent - the noodles were cooked perfectly - not too soft - just right.  The server recommended the house peanut sauce - which we both had and it was Delicious! Perfect balance of sweet and savoury- I could have drank a cup of it. :) 
We started our meal with Spring Rolls (vegetarian). I have to say , they were so crispy, hot and fresh that I had forgotten how good - good spring rolls could be. They definitely seemed hand rolled and made with care. 
I will agree that the service was somewhat slow. I was surprised as it wasnt that busy. What they lacked in speed they made up for with service, which was friendly and pleasant. I will agree with another reviewer that the decor was decidedly 80's. 

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I have been regular customers here since they opened and have never been disappointed with the food or service. They always try to sit you immediately and serve you fast as they can. Their beef satay broth is unique and delicious and their spring IN salad roll is a must have appetizer."}
{"text":"Typical local community restaurant. 
Most of their dishes are well balanced, no extra hot sauce/hoy sin/fish sauce/whatever flavor is needed. I mean well balanced!
I'm very happy with the reasonable price I paid and the remarkable size I got.
My favorite is no. 27, as I always told my friends \"this is just like the noodle my mom used to cook\""}
{"text":"Its a good place in the neighbourhood.    Everything is consistently good.
Nothing that really stands out but you always get a nice meal here.
This is a good fall back place when you don't want to travel too far outside the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and the staff are simply workers....not much personality. The food is pretty good and is comparable to most Vietnamese restaurants...all westernized and made for our Canadian taste buds. 

This place is hit or miss. When they are on their game and not too busy, it's a great experience. However, when they are not, it's not a pleasant visit...just eat and go...little service and no chit chat.  

More personality from staff would go a long way with repeat business. And appetizers are way over priced for the quality you receive."}
{"text":"Exactly as the stars say... meh, I've experienced better. Place is clean and staff is friendly, but I've had better vietnamese food.

Their spring rolls were fresh and crunchy but the amount of meat inside was small. Their pho broth wasn't very flavourful, although their portion of meat was good (I've seen places that had a very small amount). I ordered mine with egg noodles and they seemed flavourless as well. 

I probably wouldn't go back by choice."}
{"text":"If you're ever in a rush, don't go here because once you're done your food and get out of your chair, it'll make sure you get a nice jab in the waist. I got the rice dish but this egg is over cooked. The pork was over cooked. The shrimp wrapped in Chinese tofu was over cooked. I also got a small bowl of pho, the broth was extremely sweet! Over priced for the food we got, won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here recently. Small venue, but super friendly service. The food was delicious and served hot, but fast! I'll definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is a little more expensive than other Vietnamese places in the city.  And no, you don't get anything special here that you can't get elsewhere.

This place is just a good, decent place to eat dinner.  I find the food is decent, though certainly not the best I've experienced.  The place is reasonably clean, the decor fairly nice, and the owner/staff typically friendly.  

I would have rated this place 4 stars, if it wasn't for the fact they are about 10-15% more expensive than similar places.  

Tip: Try their fresh fruit smoothies.... they're pretty good. (But quite sweet)"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place when they first opened but the last few times I have been, I was less than impressed with the quality of pho coming out.

Vermicelli dishes are still quite good but the Pho, which should be the pride and joy of every Viet restaurant hasn't been up to par lately.

The last few times I've been the broth is murky, the noodles are over cooked, and the meat has tasted off.  Today the meat was especially unappetizing and the broth had no depth of flavour.  Also, its not pipping hot, so you can barely get through half your bowl and its luke warm.  Today I barely got through a quarter of it.

The two gentlemen that are always there are pleasant enough but seem like they would rather be somewhere else.

Salad rolls are hit and miss too, some days they are really poorly rolled, others the rice paper is still hard and chewy.

Going down hill and unfortunately will not likely be coming back...trying Pho Van just a few minutes from this place."}
