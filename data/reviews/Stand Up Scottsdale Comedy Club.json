{"text":"If Howard isn't a staple in Phoenix by now, I can't believe it. Huge fan of the new place. Fuck Yelp! I hate it."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for opening night. The new place is nice, food is great and service is quick! Howard as always puts on a great show and the lineup he had tonight kept my wife and I laughing throughout the night. Thanks for a great show Howard! See you soon!"}
{"text":"First time at this location and have been to the previous location a couple times. It's a bit different but nice and the working bathrooms are a plus!  We saw Carmen Lynch last night and thought it was a great show. From reading reviews it seems that some people really don't like the owner Howard, or maybe they saw him when he was having a bad night? However I've enjoyed his comedy each time I've gone. He seems like a nice guy but he has a bit of an angry stage persona so maybe that confuses some people. I thought the service was pretty decent for a room that seemed close to its max capacity. There's a one drink minimum and we enjoyed the margaritas that come from the restaurant that is connected to the club. Overall my husband and I really like this place and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Just returned form going again Howard had two great comics...They were pretty funny but Howard himself had me rolling !!! Had the Loaded Nachos and between the two of us we could not finish. Also had two cokes and they never ran dry. Service was better than in the dinning room. All n All I had a great time and will return soon."}
{"text":"I have been to several comedy clubs and this is the best by far.  The headliners are consistently hilarious, they never push drinks on u, service is good and there are no bad seats .  Easy parking, adjacent restaurant is yummy and convenient plus intimate showtoom too.  Howard is very personable.  He personally greets regulars and newbies alike.  Go there and u will go again and again.  A great place to look forward to visiting at the end of a long work week.  Check out these great reviews. No other club rates as well and other places charge more and often provide less satisfying entertainment.  Great value and a superb quality product.  This is the best place.....period."}
{"text":"We had a great time! Howard and his crew made it a very fun experience. We are looking forward to the next show.Thanks Howard you're on top of your game now!"}
{"text":"Been going to the old venue for years and loved it...new place is just as great. Lynne Koplitz performed tonight and we laughed our asses off all night....again! Thanks again Howard for a great night...love your new place and we love you!"}
{"text":"Good venue. Funny comics. Good food. Reasonable priced. Howard is a good host.... And funny. We go a few times a year."}
{"text":"First time here & it was so much fun... we really enjoyed it.  The headliner was absolutely hilarious without a lot of offensive language.  Howard, you're seriously funny, (especially the Prescott travel bit), but dude, you'd be every bit as funny with a whole lot less F-bombs.  A sincere thank you offering a great night out at a very reasonable price; we needed that after facing cancer this year.  Thank you for your service to our country. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little club in downtown Scottsdale with food and drinks from the attached Mexican restaurant, Papi Chulo's. It's an intimate little room, but I didn't feel shoehorned in like I do at Stand Up Live or the Improv. There was only a 1-drink minimum with very reasonable drink prices. Don't be fooled by the size of the club; they book really funny comics, and the host and middle acts are great as well!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know why you would bother to go to any other comedy venue in Phoenix. As a frequent visitor, I can say the shows are ALWAYS a great time. Howard is hilarious in his own right and has impeccable taste in the other comics he invites to perform at his club."}
{"text":"Howard Hughes owner is passionate about comedy his product and ensuring everyone has a tremendous experience - best comedy club in AZ state baby #laugh #comedy"}
{"text":"New location, unreal comedy. Great drinks, great service, great set up, SO much fun on a Thursday. Howard Hughes has the comedy thing figured out and dialed in. Do yourself a favor and get here soon to check this place out!"}
{"text":"This was our first time in a stand up comedy show and we had a blast! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"We went because of Lynne Koplitz, but were super impressed with the food, staff and quality of comedy. We will definitely be going there again!"}
{"text":"Just saw a show at this place and it was terrible. Dec. 30th 2016 was the date I came. The comedians were absolutely terrible. I have seen a lot of comedy and even comedy in very rural areas of the United States and nothing compares to how terrible this show was.  If there is any management reading this, all comedians were terrible other than the comedian who also hosted the show (he's an older man with a long white/gray beard).  The comedians couldn't gage the crowd and continued their terrible jokes regardless of how we all were receiving it.   The only thing good about this place was the waiter. He was a younger male with tattoos. He did a phenomenal job with all the tables he was in charge of."}
{"text":"Awesome is an understatement!  My organs hurt from laughing so hard.  Great club, great service, and not a bad seat in the house! Great date night!"}
{"text":"This was my first time back since they moved, and I like this venue a lot better. Saw Gary Gulman, who was fantastic!  You won't get the corporate comedy club experience of the big clubs, as you will undoubtedly see the owner, Howard, bouncing around greeting people and doing time on stage.  Since it's attached to a quality Mexican restaurant, the food was much better than comedy club fare.  The room is intimate with no bad seats, we did arrive an hour early to ensure we sat pretty close to the stage.  Parking is much easier than the last venue.  The only drawback, and it is a very minor one, is that the waiting area is a little congested before a show. Not a big deal, but I think it's fair to be thorough.   If you haven't already done so, give SUS a chance. Granted, comedy show experiences are largely based on the comedians, and less the clubs, so make sure you at least watch a clip of the comedian you're coming to see to make sure that it's up your alley."}
{"text":"A 2 drink minimum comedy show starring Tony Baker.  The EC was warm and friendly.  That was good.  The seating arrangements was comfortable, the drinks were great and the entertainment was amazing."}
{"text":"Howard Hughes's  Stamd Up Scottsdale is your best chance at some real and really raw ( no holds barred )  comedy relief. On any given weekend Howard delivers the best comics to valley audiences.   Need a laugh?   Stand Up Scottsdale is the place to find em.     Latest show I've attended was November 5th 2016.  I plan on many more visits. As the world is a pretty harsh place and I need the medicine that only a place like this can provide."}
{"text":"I've been going to Stand Up Scottsdale for years.  Great comedians, fun atmosphere, inexpensive tickets, reasonable food and drinks.  It's a great night out.  Tonight's comedian, Vince Morris was one of the funniest shows I've ever seen, anywhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge comedy fans and this place is literally a mile from our house. We try and go almost every other weekend.   The owner seems genuinely concerned with making sure everyone enjoys everything and the acts have all been great so far. Based on quality of shows and overall vibe, I'd give it five stars.   Tonight's Yelp rating...three stars. We ordered three alcoholic beverages. When we asked for a glass of tap water as well, we were told we can only purchase bottled water. When a club serves alcoholic beverages, I think the responsible thing to do is also serve free tap water when it's asked for. I know we've gotten it in the past; so, if this a new \"policy\", I'd ask that it be reconsidered.   We'll try again another weekend and hopefully they can find it in their hearts to spare some of that precious tap water they're hoarding ;)"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times.   Always really funny comedians.  Laughed all night long... Service is great every time.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Loved the comedy show at Howard's new location.  I was fine with the old location but I feel this place will draw some great talent.  Saw Joe Matarese this weekend and he was fabulous.  It was a full house so I suggest getting there early to get seated and get your food and drink order in.  Howard is so funny.  Please start doing a podcast Howard.  It would be a great addition to your comedy club.  I listen to Fixing Joe, Nick DiPaola and Marc Maron.  I can definitely make room on my playlist for The Howard Hughes Show.  Thanks for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"We went this past weekend and had a great time!  We had a large group and they were fantastic about accommodating us so we could all sit together which I appreciated.  Gary Gulman was great.  Overall such a fun experience - we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little local comedy club. Prices were reasonable and atmosphere was relaxed. Servers were very attentive and unobtrusive so you could enjoy the show. Owner/host Howard did a great job laying ground rules and setting tone by being funny and interacting with the crowd. Content was mature so only suitable for over 21 crowd. Definitely recommend for a funny night out."}
{"text":"Show ended 40 minutes ago and I'm still laughing!!! Love the new place Howard!! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to a comedy club for a while, or even if you have, go to Stand-up Scottsdale. Howard (I think this is his club) opens and is so freaking fabulously funny. I haven't laughed so hard for years. All the acts were great. If you're offended the word F@&k, then maybe this isn't for you. But if you're normal or abnormal or from Montana (just kidding) then you have to go before they close and remodel. Don't wait, just go go!!!! Your welcome  Enjoy"}
{"text":"First time at the new location and we were dig'in it! Howard is an excellent host and knows what funny is. If you can't remember the last time you laughed your ass off... THEN GET DOWN THERE!!!"}
{"text":"Have been twice now and had a great experience both times. The owner stopped by to see how we were doing and was very personable. My girlfriend and I thought all of the performances we have seen were hilarious."}
{"text":"4 of us went last night for the first time to Lynne Koplitz show - great vibe and a lot of love in the room for the owner and from regulars/supporters. Attached to Papi Chulo's Mexican restaurant so you can grab a margarita and food before the show - smaller nibbles menu from the same kitchen inside the venue. Price ($15+$2 service charge per person) and drink prices very reasonable. Lots of great laughs and will be back!"}
{"text":"Our group is comprised of two couples between ages 45 to 55 and have had professional careers with an opportunity to travel to many places and enjoy top notch entertainment.  This comedy line up and club venue tonight certainly  rank in the top 5.  We laughed ourselves right into tears and despite a few logistical issues, the owner was extremely professional and a talented comedian to boot!  Take our advice and be good patrons of the people who have made it a life priority to make you smile. Thank you, fine people of STAND UP SCOTTSDALE!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a blast at this comedy club. We were seated in the front row and involved in the routines throughout the evening. It was hilarious. We were laughing uncontrollably.  The facility was great. Seats were comfortable. Much more comfortable than other comedy clubs we have been to previously. Service was great and the entire atmosphere was perfect. We look forward to going again.  We were there for the owners birthday show and he (Howard) did a stupendous job. Happy birthday. Your club is awesome."}
{"text":"I have been to other clubs. The owner has never been there to say thank you and good night.  Howard Hughes will do this. It's a nice touch. The place in tempe is a dump. This place was real nice inside. I had a great seat. Laughed my ass off and had a Hella good time. I will be back and will tell all my friends. In fact if I get a chance I will tell anyone that is looking for a good time with there clothes on."}
{"text":"4 of us had an enjoyable evening with Gary Gulman headlining the laffs for the evening at Papi Chulo's, Stand Up Scottsdale. Nice small space so all seats are in good view of the comic, plenty of parking, on time shows, good drinks.  Mr. Gulman was very funny along with Mr. Longfellow a young college student soon to be graduating:  2 for the price of 1!  Who doesn't like that??  If you want a club that will offer you great live laffs, this is the place.  Who doesn't need a good laugh that isn't about politics these days? Thanks! and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Listen people, this is by far the best comedy experience and comedy value in the Valley.  Stand-up Scottsdale is located in Papi Chulos, who I can testify makes one solid mojito and has fantastic service to boot.  I'm also impressed by their salsa, they bring one spicy mix and one tame one for us gringos.  Now before you question what type of comedy club atmosphere are you going to get being joined on to a Mexican restaurant, have no fear.  The club is separate and well-designed.  Now here's the value: at least right now you receive 15% off your bill at Papi Chulos if you also have a Comedy Club ticket.  Now here's the double-bonus:  You can also get a Groupon for the show for $9.  Triple-bonus?  Yes!  They only have a one-drink limit.  Btw, the owner, Howard, cares about service: In-between comedians (who were top notch), he asked if anyone was having any service issues.  Wow!  Bottom-line:  Go!"}
{"text":"First time there to see Jen Kirkman. Really excellent. Loved the atmosphere and the owner was very personable in a way I appreciate. Everything was so reasonably priced and I felt like my having a pleasant evening mattered."}
{"text":"As always the best  comedy place in az .. And my very very good advocate the owner Howard ..... I have missed this place and so excited to be back in the loop .. I look forward to working for you in the near future and getting up on the stage my friend !!!!!!! Fantastic fantastic talent and a great wait staff .. I can't say how proud I am of your accomplishments .. Carry onward  HairDoc TK"}
{"text":"Seriously the best comedy club in AZ! My husband and I laughed the entire night and we keep laughing just thinking about it!! We were able to pick our seats and we picked front row- we loved it because the comedians kept talking to us and talking about us and it was hilarious. Ben Hague and Howard Hughes were 2 of the acts when we went and they are so talented and made us laugh so hard that our eyes were watering. Even though they \"picked on us\" we loved it and will definitely be going back. If you don't want to \"get noticed\" then don't sit front row. If you can take it and want to laugh about yourself then sit front row and they will probably call you out on something. What I love most is that it's a comedy club where I wanted to go to laugh, and they were able to do just that, make me laugh. I highly recommend going!! In fact we loved it so much we are going again tomorrow night! Hope to see you there Howard!!"}
{"text":"Had date night with my husband & went to Stand Up Scottsdale and saw Willie Barcena. He was hysterical!! My husband and I were in stitches!! Howard the owner was very funny as well!! We will be coming back & bringing our friends!!"}
{"text":"I had visited Stand Up Scottsdale at their old location and had some great laughs there. I am very happy for the Howard to have found success and a nicer venue. I took my girlfriend there for the first time and unfortunately, it was the worst experience I have ever had at a comedy club. There were two groups of people that I had the displeasure of sitting next to, who would not stop talking with each other during the acts. Not only was it difficult to hear the the opening act, but these DABs would not stop yelling at Howard to tell him how terrible his jokes were because they couldn't handle listening to someone whose opinion is not the same as theirs. These people had no etiquette or concern for anyone else in the room, and it was easy to tell that the rest of the audience wanted them to shut up and get out.  I applaud Howard for being able to stand up on that stage and take such crap, and I appreciate the insulting jokes he made about these people to their faces. One group ended up getting kicked out, but kicking them out took way to long and was far too overdue. The situation had already killed my mood for the rest of the night. I was tempted to just get up, throw my beer at their faces, and leave.  We ended up staying through the whole show, and the headliner was really great. Unfortunately, one of the talking groups kept speaking with each other through the entire show, and everyone's moods were probably already killed; to the point where it pissed off the headliner and he ended the show early. The night was overall disappointing, and I was embarrassed to have taken my girlfriend to such a terrible time.  I took one star for the terrible group I had to endure and for the venue taking too long to kick out the obnoxious audience members, and other for the headliner walking off early. I had some good laughs, but it was not enough to overcome the drama I had to listen to/watch.  To future guests of Stand Up Scottsdale, go to the 7:30 show. Hopefully by then, no one in the audience is hammered yet and won't ruin your night. I might try this place one more time at a 7:30 show in hopes of redeeming how I feel about this place."}
{"text":"I came for Jen Kirkman, who definitely did not disappoint, but will be back. The club was very intimate. The host and opening acts were super funny. Prices were good, two item minimum, which is nice if you want a snack or something verse a drink. Nice since I was DD, had my one drink then yummy queso dip, while my date could enjoy more than one beverage. Kinda wish we had dinner as it smelled great while walking through.  Was great to meet Jen and get a picture with her book afterwards. I realized last night I need more comedy shows in my life, and excited to see some upcoming acts they have listed!!!"}
{"text":"So much fun and so much more laid back than other comedy clubs. I started going here when I moved to Phoenix in 2011 and have been going there ever since. The old location was not the best as far as the building goes but the management always made sure we had a good time. The fact that there is not the absurd drink minimum makes it much easier to enjoy a less expensive evening out although I am pretty sure I have always ordered more than two drinks anyways but even then, they are not quite as pricy as other places. Howard is a wonderful host and is very personable with the crowd and I love his blunt honesty. The staff when checking in and getting seated are always nice and accomodating. Stand Up Scottsdale is the first place I bring my out of town guests and they always love it. I look forward to many more fun nights there and of course the chance to see great comedians!"}
{"text":"Tears streaming down my face, stitches in my side, bent over laughing.  Dinner before at Papi's was just as great-get the cheese crisps."}
{"text":"Well, it was certainly a memorable night. My friends and I saw a show back in late February with Howard as the opening act. He kept stopping mid-joke to yell at a group of 3-4 people who apparently were chatting. Then when he told them \"maybe you should leave\" another person from a different large group called out \"maybe YOU should\"...and then everything went down from there. Long story short, Howard couldn't keep his cool and ended up awkwardly kicking out a fourth of the crowd. There was even a small brawl that broke out when someone tried to come back in after get kicked out. We were sitting at a table in the corner next to a group of people with a bald, older man who claimed to be the owner. One of his group members was throwing ice cubes at the crowd during the debacle. Another old gentleman was literally leaning over a young lady's shoulder creepily reading her phone as she was typing up a yelp review while an old lady kept screaming \"bit&% get out\" or \"we don't want you here!\" at her. Prior to the show the bald man who claimed to be the owner got up in my friends face as we were walking in and demanded to know why we were going in before him because according to him \"I should be seated first because I own the place\". When the waitress brought us our drinks she got our order wrong and so we were discussing our order when the same group turned around and shushed us; then proceeded to talk and yell during the entirety of the show. I was so distracted I couldn't even enjoy the remainder of the show. Also, while I have a sense of humor, Howard referred to the group that got kicked out as \"the cheap as%#oles who bought tickets off of groupon\". We bought tickets off of groupon...but, don't worry because us \"cheap as@&oles\" will never come back. Have fun making all those jokes referencing bad yelp reviews. Because they're gonna continue to roll in. For the sake of this business I sure hope that bald man was not actually the owner. Not only is my group never returning but we're spreading the word about how awful this place is."}
{"text":"New location, still great shows! The new location has a door outside but it isn't the main entrance it seems, go inside of the restaurant and it is on the right. Smaller than the last location but good location close to everything. Drinks were reasonable and we got some chips and salsa for the show. It was pretty full for a Thursday night and the comedian and owner did great sets. We will be back for sure! Glad they found a new spot and hopefully they will do well. Love that it is locally owned."}
{"text":"We saw Zoltan last night and he was fantastic! Great atmosphere, great show. All around great experience!! I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I have not laughed so much in my life where I am all laughed out and couldn't anymore. Chris porter and the others were amazing last night. I had a good time. And I loved seeing my bf laugh"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Stand Up Scottsdale last Saturday night. It was my first time at a comedy club and they did not disappoint.  The club is located inside Papi Chulo's on Scottsdale Road. There is an entrance from the outside you actually enter the club from inside the restaurant. Doors open about an hour before the show starts...for the 7:30pm show anyway. There was a second show at 9:30pm (not sure if this is the case all the time) and we left a little before that time. Quick turn around between shows.  We got there early and got our seats. There is a two item minimum - drinks or food. We ordered a couple drinks and chatted with our server a little bit since we were early and people hadn't started filing in quite yet. According to him, the location recently moved. Service was quick and seemed to stay that way even as more patrons started arriving.  The chairs are set in groups of four with a small table in between. The couple that was sat with us mentioned that this new location was smaller than the original. Neither of us ordered food but there was a good amount coming from the kitchen. Chips and salsa cost $4.50 (small order - probably not bottomless), that is the only price I remember from the menu. Someone ordered the beef chimichangas...they smelled delicious.   The show started on time and when it ended an we left, the patrons for the second show were all gathered outside. I'm sure the timing has a lot to do with he comedians themselves so each show has the potential to be different. We had such a good time and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We saw Jeremy Hotz perform here this evening. My god, that guy is hilarious!  The club is intimate and comfortable with efficient, friendly staff.    They do have a 2 item minimum, like every other comedy club I have ever been to. However, their drink prices are reasonable.  And, even better, the food items on the club menu count toward the 2 item minimum!    We had dinner at the attached restaurant & got VIP seating because we dined there before the show.  The food was really pretty good, delivered almost amazingly fast by efficient servers.    If you are looking for a place with a lot of flashy bells and whistles (and typical Scottsdale snobbery), this is not your place.  But if you want a fun, casual night out with good Mexican food, friendly & attentive staff, and great comedians who will make you laugh til your face hurts, this IS your place.  We will be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with friends. It was a great time. The owner Howard was wonderful and the  comedy was great. Great venue cant wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Went to See Chris Porter last night and it was a blast - intimate setting, not a bad seat in the house.  Howard is a great host and obviously loves what he does and we loved him also, the other comedians were great, we literally had aching cheeks by the time we left.  Will definitely be back for more laughter.  Keep up the good work.!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT & WILL BE BACK! The owner, Howard Hughes was/is AMAZING.  AND comedian Joe Matarese was amazing as well. The two of them, including the other local comics who took stage, made for an incredible experience. I don't find much funny in life ie TV shows, movies etc, but these guys had me laughing hard. A much needed break from my own self-centered focus on my issues and situations.  They didn't just stand and tell jokes, but their material was real, ad hoc and came from their personal experiences.  Not sure who the dumb girl was at the end, offering her \"advice\" to the comics - but statistically there had to be at least one there! KUDOS TO STAND UP SCOTTSDALE! A++++++"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Howard likes responding to negative reviews, but he comes off as a whiner and crybaby. Not everybody likes B rate comics and fake tough guy owners who harrass people on social media after leaving a bad review (see below). He thinks I actually entered his club and has got me confused with someone else. Read my review Howie - I never entered your postage stamp sized club. Clueless and he gets his inspiration from Bill Cosby - what does that say about Howard?  Called up a few weeks ago to attempt to make a reservation, but it was a miserable fail. The only reason I had to call was that the reservation system online wasn't taking my coupon code. My suspicion is that since it was a freebie, Howard baited and switched and tried to get people to buy a full priced ticket. Anyway, Howard answered the phone and he sounded drunk or over medicated and mumbled something about how they usually take phone reservation, but not now and then I couldn't understand the rest of what he mumbled. This guy is the Donald Trump of comedy and not in a good way, all show and no go. I attended another show at his old place and he spent 20 minutes making up some stupid story about his fake girlfriend and texting and another god awful unfunny rant about the freeway shooter.       This is the first comedy club in history to downsize. Once the tourists leave, this place will be a ghost town again. He already blew 150K of his investors money and failed before. It's only a matter of time before this place bottoms out as well."}
{"text":"Great evening! Not the usual massive venue so it was more intimate than other clubs.  All of the acts were really good. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Having never been to this venue before, I had no idea what to expect. Apparently, this is their new location.  Initially, I'll admit that I was slightly confused as to whether I was visiting discounted hotel destinations, desired a crispy taco or was going to see Chris Porter perform at Stand Up Scottsdale.   As it turned out, my confusion was laid to rest after having successfully navigated my way past the Days Inn parking lot, through a Mexican restaurant and was ultimately ushered inside the unassuming doors of this cozy comedy club.   And inside, I was pleasantly surprised to find a very intimate room that afforded all seats a comfortable and relaxed setting with a great view of the stage and performers.   It's not like some of the other comedy clubs where you find yourself crammed against some stranger while being accosted by waitresses with a \"couldn't care less\" attitude who are constantly interrupting your experience trying to get the two drink minimum out of your wallet.   The staff was very friendly and respectful of the fact that comedians were performing.   I've been to many comedy clubs in Scottsdale, New York, Los Angeles, and throughout the country and this was, surprisingly, one of my favorite experiences of them all.   I was also pleasantly surprised by the level of talent of the opening acts.   It appeared that this club more carefully selected the comedians then is the case in so many other clubs where you find yourself being tortured by the openers, sweating profusely and wanting to put a bullet in your own temple.   And the headliner, Chris Porter, who recently released a special on Netflix which is a MUST SEE if you're not familiar with him (yet), just f*%cking crushed it from the moment he took the stage to the moment he left.    Afterwards, the comics were in the lobby (aka Mexican restaurant bar area) to greet all the guests.   So, overall, it is a great club, with pleasant service in a very comfortable intimate setting.   Bravo, Stand Up Scottsdale! P.S. As an added bonus, if you happen to crave a margarita and taco on your way out, you only have to walk 8 feet :-)"}
{"text":"A whole new understanding of LOL and I don't easily laugh- this place was top notch. Comedians were clever and could manage a tough crowd with skill and humor. The show included a handful of opening acts, (my fav, Mike Malloy, a quirky, skinny kid from Boston who had hilarious insights on being a white male and on watching Animal Planet after smoking weed!) Quick witted humor, and no one digressed into tired, middle school content. Highly recommend, if you're disappointed, you're a buzz kill!"}
{"text":"Rude and poor planned place. Don't go here.....   Please beware of this place. They are rude right when you enter. My boyfriend and I went here to see a friend perform and it's people like the staff here that suck the fun out of a night out. Upon enterance we were advised that it was cash only - not a problem we were going to go to the bank, the problem started when we were being mocked by the staff for not having cash on us. (sorry we don't carry cash ever since my boyfriend's wallet was stolen). They were basically stating how stupid we were. Not only that they messed up the scheduling for said friend so he was rushed around and had the night shortened for him. After going here I left a simple review (see above) and I got harrassed by the owner for leaving a bad review. If you leave a bad review on here YOU'LL BE HARRASSED BY THE OWNER WHILE HE IS USING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ON YOUR FACEBOOK. He literally goes on your profile to try finding something to talk shit about. How appropriate is that? I'm really glad we did not give this place any money, we ended up having a better night elsewhere."}
{"text":"Small amazing venue.  From the owner ( who speaks amazing Spanish ) to the caring staff and then the great selection of comedians. Thank you for making this my new favorite place to go and laugh to re-charge"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed Francisco Ramos and the opening act. Great way to spend a night with friends"}
{"text":"I popped my cherry with Comedy Clubs here and so glad I did! Laughed the whole 2 hours with each and every act and I WAS SOBER! Very funny very talented crew. So worth the drive and money, definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Right now shitty yelp review...When I come to see comedy I don't need to deal with political views and people calling me names because I walked out to the foyer to get away from the classless people...even though I didn't say a word!  I just want to just laugh and fun.  If your agenda is different then just go to another venue that isn't COMEDY."}
{"text":"Thank you Howard for a great time! Fabulous host and amazing comedians! Can't wait until next time! Great place to go for a hilarious night out!"}
{"text":"Fabulous show. Really laughed the entire time the main comedian Chris Collings was on!!! Wished he was there again so I could take friends. Truly enjoyed the whole experience. Fun comedians! Great cozy atmosphere. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous time at Stand Up Scottsdale - Lynne Koplitz was excellent!  Thanks Howard for a great girls night out! Making plans for another visit, soon...."}
{"text":"Came here for a comedy show. It's our second time here. Had a great time again. It's a perfect way to start the night. We get there early and get dinner and have a few drinks. Watch the comedy show and then walk over to the bars around the corner after.   When you walk in there is two hostesses one on the left for papi chulos the other on the right is for stand up. Be sure to tell the stand up hostess that you're there for dinner as well and they'll reserve you a table.   This place is apparently a whole lot cleaner than the last one. I never made it over to it but that seems to be the general consensus. The atmosphere is fun. Audience is a wide range of old to young folks. Certainly an older Scottsdale crowd though.   If you haven't checked it out you really should. It's a fun time and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is my favorite comedy club in AZ!  I was in last week to see Lynne Koplitz, she had me in tears. I really enjoyed everyone who opened for her too!  Howard, the new club is the tits and ass! I'm looking right now to see who performing this weekend!  Thank you for the laughs!"}
{"text":"Great times being a fan of the club for over 7 years! Great times, great comics, Howard's a great host. We look forward to the new spot and Howard's return! Thanks again for the great times and memories!!!!"}
{"text":"Opening night in the new venue, which is accessed through Papi Chulo's. All of the acts were funny. The stage is easy to see from any seat. Try not to sit by the door as the wait staff and patrons are constantly going in and out.  My drink was bad, but that's the restaurant's fault."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time. Just as good as the last location, great new food! Loved the new room! Would go again very very soon."}
{"text":"I love the new location -- inside the same building as the Papi Chulo's Mexican restaurant.The old location was a mess but I adore Howard and he's the main reason for returning often. Howard's routines are always fresh and funny. Enough about Howard...can't let his head get any bigger. Ha! Best comedians weekend after weekend. Thanks to this place, I have twice been a part of Lynne Koplitz's audience -- she is my favorite comedienne. Love the set up --- very intimate. Reminds me of the audience set up of various smaller clubs you'd see on TV comedy shows.    *** This comedy club is guaranteed not to run out of chips...and I love my Chips and Salsa/Guacamole! Congratulations and thanks Howard for a great comedy venue. Continued success on your new place! Support this comedy club and be ready to laugh & laugh. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Had a great time. The comedians where great, the owner was hilarious and the drinks kept coming. Loved it."}
{"text":"First time Yelper, As much as I hate social media and all this crap, after 4 visits to  Stand Up Scottsdale I thought I should say something.  I have yet to be let down by this club. The owner is funny, real, and tells it like it is. Love him or hate him you have to give him credit for taking care of the customer(s) and not putting up with BS from customers or his acts. He truly is there to make sure everyone has a good time."}
{"text":"The headliner was amazing. Let me say that first. She is, after all, why I purchased the tickets. I have spent the last 5 years living in Chicago, downtown, where I spent many nights at various comedy spots. I have never in my life witnessed such horrible warm-up acts in my life. It was actually difficult to watch. I wanted to laugh - I actually was trying to laugh - because I felt badly for the acts, but I couldn't. It would be dishonest. The venue is nice, and the service was alright - just order two drinks at once. Come before and eat at the restaurant - get a margarita. You'll need to be pretty toasted before the comedians start in order to have a decent time."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a comedy club. I will definitely be back! It was an awesome venue with fantastic service, strong drinks, and most importantly, hilarious comedy. All around great experience."}
{"text":"I am here right now, watching you make me feel like a piece if shit for not having reviews. So, you're welcome. And thanks for your service. But seriously, great fucking show all around. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past 3 months and I highly recommend this venue! The owner/host is hilarious enough to make it worth the visit and the main act has always had me in stitches from laughing so much... IF YOU WANT TO LAUGH, YOU HAVE COME TO THIS COMEDY CLUB!!!! The food & drinks are excellent as well!!!"}
{"text":"Small venue but a great show. The service was a little slow at the beginning, but that's what happens when 2 servers get 130 customers at a time. The opener was an awkwardly funny girl. We saw Chris Porter and he is just absolutely hilarious. We sat in the front which was literally touching the stage. Honestly, I prefer a smaller environment for comedy shows because you're less likely to have to deal with drunk hecklers. The drinks are reasonably priced as well. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Just left the 12/31/16 6:00 p.m. set. Will be back. Bravo to every comedian that takes the stage..."}
{"text":"This club was the best!! Really amazing food prices and the best salsa ever, really nice staff! Saw Andrew Kennedy, great seating as well and great performers"}
{"text":"Went here a few weekends ago with some friends. Loved the new place!! Best comedy spot ever. The service was great and Howard is always brutally hilarious! I'll be back and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"New location, but same amazing quality comedy. Every time I see a show put on by Stand Up Scottsdale I leave with an aching stomach from laughing so much. New location has a great set up with a very intimate setting. Every seat is a good seat. Thanks for another solid night."}
{"text":"I've seen Howard perform several times and he still has me laughing my a** off! His comedic delivery is on point and content is always something that we can all relate to. Cheers to a lifetime of laughs HH!"}
{"text":"Howard doesn't like when \"friends\" post reviews, but heck I was there last night and last time I checked I was an Elite Yelper, I also don't work for Stand up Scottsdale...anymore!  I was excited to see the new place, and I tend to be hyper critical, and I have a great eye for a well run comedy club, I have been in many, some well run and some not, so here goes.  My first impression of The Days Hotel complex was Stellar! Squeaky clean, and an amazing combo of Rock and Roll and Southwestern décor. The staff was friendly, kind, and helpful.  It was once I hit the doors of the new SUS that I knew something special was about to happen. Personal greetings from Howard and Lisa for all, not just me. They want you there, they want to entertain you.  What happened was a great line-up of very funny comedians was set and achieved entertaining a full house. The fact that Howard is booking such amazing talent in what is obviously a small room (120?seats) in such an intimate setting makes this place a cant miss.   Looking at the calendar there is no letting up, these are the same comedians being booked at the really big clubs in town and across the country. Take advantage of that because sometimes in small rooms magic happens as I think it did with Deitrich Shelton, Paul Johnson Howard and Lynne Koplitz last night. It was one of my very favorite shows ever.  Service was great and Food and beverage options are as good as the 5th Ave location at its best. Come hungry and early because The food looks amazing as did the margaritas.  I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome time here. Thanks for all the laughs. All the comics were hilarious. The seats were great. The servers were friendly and fast. Thanks for an awesome night!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently a good time. I've been to over a dozen shows and its about time I wrote a review. They bring in great comedians and the service is quick and friendly. Highly recommend checking out a show on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Best comedy spot in town, hands down. Local comedians meet big acts. Super chill and intimate, and the new location rocks! This is still the only comedy spot in town that I enjoy going to. A huge plus? You don't have to break the bank to see a show. Finally, someone who gets it, and wants their patrons to enjoy the whole experience! Two thumbs up from this lady."}
{"text":"Howard did not disappoint..service was fast and we were able to get some good appetizers. Line up was great and laughing non stop the whole time. Looking for a good night come here.  Just reopened today!"}
{"text":"SUS is even more awesome in its new, more intimate location!  It's connected to a great Mexican restaurant at a convenient Scottsdale Rd location (just north of Chaparral) with plenty of free parking.  The food is hot and fresh, and served by a friendly wait staff.  Howard was a great host, as always, and his comedy just keeps getting better.  The crowd laughed non-stop at the dual-headliner lineup.  We sat down front as the waves of laughter washed over us all night.    You gotta check out the new digs this weekend.  Tell them you saw this review on Yelp,and Howard will hook you up with free admission.  I suggest the late shows Friday or Saturday for the best seats.  It's the most fun you can have with your clothes on."}
{"text":"I found Stand Up Scottsdale while visiting my parents who live in Scottsdale. They had received a coupon booklet called the \"Inside Coup.\" It had a 2 for 1 ticket coupon. I went on their website and found their new address at the Days Inn and Papi Chulo's. The website had a great Deal. 2 VIP seats and free admission if you ate dinner at the attached mexican restaurant Papi Chulo's, plus get 15% your meal if you eat before! My husband and I hadn't been on a date night in about 6 months, so this was going to be big for us.  We got their about an hour before the show so we could eat in the actual restaurant at a normal sized table. Service was good. The food was pretty standard Mexican, which we enjoyed. My husband really liked the different margarita options they had and I liked the Red Sangria. The Chips and salsa were delicious.   We headed to the right side of the building where the Comedy Club resides. It is a nice venue. Lots of seating. We sat in the front. There was a 1 drink minimum in the comedy club, which is totally reasonable because in Los Angeles it is always 2 drink minimum and a cover charge.  It appears Howard runs a great club with great comedians. We laughed our butts off all night! We thought everyone had talent to make us a laugh. We were there when there were 2 different Pauls performing and both were awesome. The headliner was not as good as the people who had been on prior. It didn't seem like he prepared at all and complained a lot (which I later researched and found out that is his schtick) . This has NO reflection on the Club itself.   At one point I realized that this was the best date night my husband and I had in a super long time. We will definitely be back! It was nice to just laugh, drink and be merry for a night :)"}
{"text":"Great experience.  Just saw Nick Guerra tonight and it was a fantastic show! The owner is a riot I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming to Stand Up Scottsdale for years (both locations). It is our ONLY place for comedy! We've tried others in the Valley and no others can compare. I appreciate this place where I can get amazing comedy, along with great food and drinks (only 1 drink minimum)! If you've never been, Stand Up Scottsdale is a must!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I took my brother for the first time and he loved it!!!! All the comedians were amazing we had a great time ... next time we are in town we will definitely come back again. Wish we would of won the tickets for the concert though.lol but it's ok we had an fabulous time."}
{"text":"The opening acts were solid, and the headliner, Mike Gaffney, was hilarious! It was a fun night at a great venue."}
{"text":"Just went this evening for the first time with my husband for Saturday night date night. Got our tickets on Groupon, FYI don't worry about getting tickets on the website after that. Just make your reservations and then show up early to get a good table with your Groupon Vouchers. The Mexican food it's attached to is awesome, highly recommend the cheese crisp appetizer or fiesta platter. Margaritas on the rocks, yes please! Even though there was only one server, we got our drinks, if you are not a patient person go get them at the bar. Otherwise, the owner and the comedians were great entertainment! Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Howard does an amazing job running the club and I love how he opens all of the shows. He will keep you laughing, no matter what story about his life he tells. The comedians that he brings in are pretty varied, so it is always a surprise as to what the entire show will be, and the jokes are never the same. Since they changed locations, the food selection is pretty limited, but that's the only downside. If you are the type of person who gets easily offended, I wouldn't recommend going to the club as the comedians do make jokes about everything, and will pick out people in the audience to interact with."}
{"text":"Great opening night in the new location.  Funny lineup.  Had a great time as usual."}
{"text":"Awwwwwwwsome !!!!!  We've been here many times before but last night was the 1st at their new-old-new location. Loved it! More parking, attached to a nice restaurant with affordable drinks, air conditioning while you wait for the doors to open(big plus it was like 115' at 930pm!) ...inside is adorable and quaint. We love Howard! He's so kind hearted and hilarious. Really makes you feel important for coming out. Saw Ahmed Baharoocha and he was amaaaazing!!!! Best ever. Could not stop laughing! Love the new place.  Great experience! Especially for someone like me who is not into being in Scottsdale for a night out! We  this place. PS...love that it was not all politically charged too, getting tired of hearing about Clinton and Trump, this was a nice break!"}
{"text":"I feel pretty safe in saying I've now been to every comedy club in town. Non are better than standup Scottsdale. It's the best environment and a lot of really quality local stand ups. Can't wait to see Gary Gullman in a couple of weeks!"}
{"text":"Comedians were hilarious. Food was great. Hostess was rude and demeaning. Waiting to get in to the comedy show was a disaster. The entrance is located in the waiting area of a restaurant. It was very crowded and difficult for people to walk in/out. Seating of guests was unorganized."}
{"text":"Three drops of pee came out!! My wife and I have had the pleasure of seeing two shows SUS and both times were fantastic! Howard who owns and operates the club is a deep and dark comic who's intelligent and frankly unabashed sets are thrilling and sometimes even dangerous! I defy anyone to heckle the man and not come out with a new one squarely drilled! Howard always lines up too-notch acts from across the country and often gives up-and-comers a chance to take the stage as host.  Now here's the thing: all comedians are different. Their acts and comedic approach are as unique as the individual performing them. If you aren't familiar with the Headliner, go to YouTube and check them out beforehand to see if you like them.  I myself have a huge respect for the art of stand up comedy. IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DO WELL. It takes an enormous amount of work and natural wit to be good. The best comics make it look easy. They are usually the ones who spend a lot of time perfecting their material.  Now as far as the service goes, it's great for where your at: it's basically theatre with food and drinks. The staff is dealing with a large group of people in a fairly tight space trying to deliver food and bev without distracting from the show. If you want the type of service where the cocktail server asks if you need another drink every five minutes, go back to Applebee's. Or order two at a time. You're there to enjoy 90min of sometimes thought-provoking,  sometimes boundary-pushing, sometimes goofy, but always side-splitting comedy. I'm a fan. We will return again and again because there's always something new at this fine comedy club!!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Stand Up Scottsdale location this past Saturday for the 9:30 show with friends, and everything was great.  The new location is very nice, and Brody Stevens the headliner was really funny.  I saw some previous reviews about bad service, but we had excellent service the whole evening.  The friendly lady who checked us in, and escorted us to our seats was a big improvement from the people who used to do that at the old location.  Our waiter was always close by, and checked on us multiple times during the show to make sure we were ok.  This is a great option for a fun night out with friends!!!"}
{"text":"Still the same arrogant owner,Howard, that Bar Rescue tried to knock some sense into. Not enough seats, only one waitress, too hot inside, drinks priced $2-$4 more than the bar.  Shockingly the guest comedians did NOT rip on President Trump, a much needed relief from the constant media bashing at every opportunity.  The only one to throw out his Trump point of view was Howard, the owner who thinks he is hilarious. The only thing that was funny was this skinny,gay acting man lying that he was in the Marines, operation Desert Storm!  The comedians were very funny. Too bad the place is closing in April and may open again in 2018 (long time from now)! Hopefully Howard will take an opportunity to learn how to run a service oriented business and come up with a better on stage act for himself."}
{"text":"Had a beer with the owner. Super down to earth and funny. The opening acts really raise the bar for the main act to do well. Thanks to Howard for his service."}
{"text":"I have been to stand up Scottsdale many times now. Every time I have been, I have had an amazing time. Laughs with every visit, great service, will continue to visit on regular basis"}
{"text":"Great show, great service. Good food. Love the new venue. Lots of parking.  Semper Fidelis."}
{"text":"First time at the new location tonight! Had a blast! The location is a little tight, but it adds to the great atmosphere. The lineup was great, the price point was great, especially for Scottsdale.  The owner/host was hilarious and was gracious about switching my showtime through email, even though I ended up going to the original time anyways. Definitely would recommend and will go again!"}
{"text":"We went here to see a show while visiting from Seattle. What a great venue! The servers, the host, and the comedians were excellent! Sad we don't have venues as great as this!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best comedy club in ARIZONA! Last night my boyfriend & I went to a show and could NOT STOP LAUGHING. Phil Hanley was headliner (HYSTERICAL), but all the acts were so different, talented, and hilarious!! Howard - if you are reading this, we are your newest fans. Thanks for being a warm and friendly comedic genius! Looking forward to the next show!"}
{"text":"Loved coming here. This was our first time in two years and our first time at the new location. We came for my husbands birthday and had a blast! The drinks were great. The bathroom was BEAUTIFUL and in great working order. Over all it was a wonderful experience. And because of coming early and dining in, we got to pick or seats and were in the best spot. Thank you Stand Up Scottsdale for such a great evening!"}
{"text":"We had a great time, Gary Gulman was fun, and Howard...................the bathrooms are nice!!"}
{"text":"Night started out kinda crazy with hecklers getting tossed, but than once they were gone night picked up great. Howard was funny and the headliner Joe was funny as heck.  Had great seats and a blast. I will go again."}
{"text":"Always a fun time! Howard's dry sense of humor and non scripted comedy is awesome.   Almost every comedian we've seen here is so funny. There was just one opener who wasn't funny, but that's great odds.   Sad to hear they'll be closing in April.  Get there while you still can!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Howard is awesome, we have enjoyed his stand up and club for the last 3 years. So far we have caught Gary Gulman and Chris Porter at the new place, and they were both FANTASTIC shows. Thank you for the good times and the great laughs. We will keep coming back, and we will keep sitting front row."}
{"text":"Visited with my daughter on Sunday, April 10th. Headliner was Sammy Obeid. Really great, lots of laughing. Loved \"teaching math in the hood\" and all the one-liners. So funny!   Enjoyed all the comedians, especially Sammy and Carlton(?). Great crowd, great venue.  Started out at the restaurant bar and was able to take our drinks in with us. Liked that. If we hadn't eaten before would have had chips and margaritas... Next time. What could be better than great comedy, chips and margaritas?  Visiting from So Cal but will definitely go again if the opportunity presents. Super fun! Great club."}
{"text":"Great spot. Funny. Good drinks. Bill was cheap. Get here and have a good time. If you don't, then you suck. He fought for us! USA"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The night my husband and I visited the club had just ONE server for the whole place. That poor girl was busting her buns and got everyone served. Talk about Wonder Woman! The entertainment was phenomenal and the staff worked together to over come a potentially harsh evening with very little staff. Howard creates an excellent atmosphere! We felt like we were sitting at your own kitchen table busting up laughing with our 4 best friends. Stay away from the corporate comedy clubs and go see Howard for the best vibe in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is our third time back to Stand Up Scottsdale this year!  Friendly, fast service from the hostess and wait staff.  We always enjoy the show and it's very reasonably priced!  By far, this has become my favorite comedy club here in Phoenix.  Also, there is a Mexican Restaurant attached to the club. We like being able to have dinner and then walk into the comedy club for the show. No need to move the car!  So glad to have discovered this great find!  Thanks Stand Up Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love the new house.  Toilets work.. No science experiments on the floor.. Food recognizable.. No worries about dead bodies out back.. Parking lot fits more than 6 cars.. Paints not peeling.. No sewer smell floating around the place..no pre-show dark closet to be herded into.. Yep, it has changed a bit..but.. Still has the same hilarious Howard H. and his top-notch line-ups.  You will still laugh your ass off and leave your Haz-Mat suit at home now.."}
{"text":"We had family from out of town with us and wanted to enjoy some laughs.  We had been here once before she it was a great show. I left a 5 star review too.  This time around was awful.  We arrived for the 930 show 30 min early and had a couple drinks at the bar. Show started a lil late but that's OK. The problem was the service. Seemed like forever before drink order was taken.  When we receive the drinks we ask to order food but was told the kitchen was closed.  That a really upsetting.  Then it was time for the bill.  The server added a couple drinks that others had already paid cash up front for.    Boils down to bad service. It really put a hole in our evening."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i went to see Chris Franjola last night. Super funny talented guy! Howard was hilarious as the opening act. Even the lawyer from Coco Beach laughed.  Great service and a lot of fun. Will be back."}
{"text":"There were some hiccups at the start of the show so we started a little late but they didn't cut the show short. Entertainment was great! Food was great. I'm happy and I recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"The show last night was HILARIOUS! Thank you to  Joe Matarese, Paul, Mike, Howard Hughes...you guys all were funny!  Drinks were task and not over priced and for a full house  (literally) service was great! Even during the entry \"procedure\" where there was a shit ton of folks waiting to get in...Lisa Hess did a PHENOMENAL job of making sure all parties were together and everyone was seated within 15 minutes. It was my first time there and DEFINITELY NOT my last! Thanks Howard and Lisa for your hard work, your hospitality, and dedication to making your new establishment a success...IT SHOWS!  WELL DONE AND WELL  PLAYED !"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in a row.  I have had fun each time I go there. My favorite comedian was the \" Get in the van\" guy. I like the cozy nicely cooled venue. Reasonably priced red bull.  $ 17 for a show ticket is a great deal. I suggest the 7:30 show there is a smaller crowd.  I shall call him Blondie. Blondie is as hot as a lousianna suicide wing. The Improv has just become so greedy. I prefer supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"I love this place! The prices are low and the headliners have never failed to be hilarious. Several shows had headliners that were so funny my face started to hurt from laughing and smiling so much. Drink prices are about average and service is great."}
{"text":"I'm kind of a comedy snob and I'm just saying, this place does quality comedy We've been twice  and both times I've left with a sore face from smiling so much. Vic was crying he was laughing so hard. The warm up comedians are as funny as the main act. 2 drink minimum (or item) for the show is reasonable with healthy pours. What a great time! . By the way, you can eat at Papi Chulo's first (great fajitas) and get a discount on your dinner."}
{"text":"Loved the show. Howard and Joe were great. A few snowflakes were offended by some Trump jokes,  heckled and were kicked out (much to the delight of the rest of the crowd). It made the show even better. More material for the comedians after that!  Don't believe those 1 star reviews from tonight.  Those patrons were rude and were asked to leave then tried to start a brawl on their way out. The rest of the people were happy to see them go and had a really fun night!"}
{"text":"Awesome night!  We love comedy clubs, and usually opening acts are a hit or miss.  Both opening acts were amazing hits.  One of them was the owner of the club.  At first I was skeptical, but he rocked it! Drinks were yummy, and waiter wasn't pushy.  First time here, and we absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"We saw Gary Gulman last night. One of my favorites  It's a really intimate venue and we had 2nd row.  Howard is very funny and does a great job with organizing the changeover from the early to late shows.  The next time I'm in Scottsdale I'll be back.  Thanks again Howard. It was a blast"}
{"text":"Wonderful new location and as always great fun. Saw Chris Porter as headliner with my Fiance and her mother, and we laughed the entire time for all the comedians. This was the third time going to Howard's comedy club, twice in his old joint, and every time has been a great experience.  Will definitely recommend to others for a good time.  Promise next time I will watch your Bar Rescue episode before going."}
{"text":"The comedians who went on tonight were hilarious! Howard even more so. People randomly got offended in others business BUT Howard and Joe took that and made it into a funny situation. The only reason this isn't 5 star is that there was a very rude woman behind us and picked on people and even someone who didn't say a word for no reason (Not Howard's fault at all and can't be helped I understand). Someone said it was an owner but I do not know for sure. Go see them before they close!! Well worth it!! only suggestion I would add is to mention that there is assigned seating on the website (unless I missed it haha!)."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved here from Los Angeles a few months back.  This was our first outing to a comedy club in the area.  It was a blast!  The comics were great and the venue is very nice.  It looks like by chance we attended the first show in the new venue.  It went off without a hitch.  It is also conveniently located beside Papi Chulo's so we had dinner prior to the show.  Howard knows what he is doing and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Owner/professional stand-up comedian/Producer/Host Howard Hughes always keeps reinventing his venue. National acts with the funniest local talent to choose from in a large competitive scene. Always backs the \"Good Guy, \" very personable, he and his comedy rooms have been an icon of the area for a long time.  His hired staff is always nice and the food is always great.  He'll be popping up soon with another class operation."}
{"text":"I brought my husband and my friends that were in town from Chicago. When we left our cheeks (face cheeks) hurt so much from laughing. Howard the owner was the funniest, he invloves you and interacts with the audience. We left and couldn't stop talking about the show all the way home. Thank you for such a fun night out!"}
{"text":"best comedy spot in town.....howard the host is hilarious.....great list of comedians...you start laughing as soon as the show starts and can't stop until its over....make sure to go to papa chilis next door before the show.....goid mexican food.....just found out to ight that the hotel was sold and is being renovated so club will close end of april and reopen in a different location in phoenix....saw willie barcena again.....didnt stop laughing the whole night!!!!"}
{"text":"Jonathon Gerber was a great new comic, owner Howard is also super cool, great show every time we go, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this comedy club. It could have just been the night I went but I really didn't find the comics that funny. The club is an awkward space with no direct entrance. It is located in the same building as a restaurant and to enter, you must go through the restaurant. It made for a hectic and confusing check-in/ paying process and it was quite crowded when we entered. They also have a one drink minimum requirement for the club in addition to the cover charge. I know that is not uncommon for a place like this and I just want to state it here. All in all, I wasn't too impressed and would recommend other comedy clubs around, but I wouldn't be opposed to checking stand up scottsdale again if there was a comedian I knew I liked here."}
{"text":"Well, it sucked last night.  Waiters do not even know what your choices are of beer.  you have to ask three times to get  a piece of lime for the drink you ordered with it. Only $5 small bottles of water!!  crazy.   Service stunk.  The show was barely laughable.  They stick to one subject and beat it so bad that nothing was funny anymore.  i was at the old location - was better service and comedians.   The owner... super nice when you get there and then he turns rude!  Not the first time we experienced that.  Dont think will chance it again.  The Venue down the street is much more relaxing, service is great, people are just nice."}
{"text":"Great show and great service!!  Howard really knows how to put together a quality, entertaining show without costing a fortune.  Definitely go if you've never been and you'll never waste your time with the other places in town again."}
{"text":"Last night was our second visit to Stand Up Scottsdale.  We love this place.  Great comics, good service, and decent prices.  The owner, Howard, is a awesome comic, and we enjoy his routine as much as the headliner.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Howard is the Man  Great atmosphere headliner Nick Guerra killed it opening act Cliff Cash was amazing . Sad they are closing but can't wait for the grand opening at the new location..  Hopefully closer to central Phoenix.. #fanforlife"}
{"text":"My husband and I just went to our first show at Stand Up Scottsdale and had the best time ever! The headliner was Jason Collings who had us laughing nonstop, but the host Howard and the opening act, Andy Steinberg were equally hilarious! The prices were so reasonable and the food served was really good. We just wish we had been coming here sooner! Without a doubt we will be attending more shows, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! We highly recommend and have already messaged all of our friends about coming here!"}
{"text":"Great service, funny comics, and intimate setting.  We will definitely go back.  Support local comedy clubs!!!"}
{"text":"Had the BEST time and so many laughs-my stomach and cheeks hurt from laughing so much.  This is undoubtedly the FUNNIEST comedy show I've seen in Scottsdale. Thanks so much.  It was great therapy!! \"NeckBrace\""}
{"text":"I only write Yelp reviews for 2 reasons; to encourage others to run TO an establishment, or to run FROM it. Stand Up Scottsdale is a venue you must experience. The all-around entertainment experience they offer is almost nostalgic in its offering. The owner Howard opened the show and is hysterical in his own right. He has comedy chops worthy of national exposure and a palpable love for his club and his club-goers experience. My wife and I saw the show headlined by Vince Morris and would go see him again tonight if we could; he was that funny. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the club was down to only 1 server and they didn't miss a beat. They were communicative, accommodating and even made fun at their own expense. I'm thrilled that we discovered this gem in our hometown and I can't wait to go see Howard and his team again soon!"}
{"text":"I had been to the old location twice. Tried out the new location with my daughter and was happy! Great show. Space is small and they probably should put a little more room between the rows but it is a good space. You can get bites from the kitchen at the restaurant it is attached to and of course a full bar. We would have got more drinks but the row we were in the server just couldn't get to us. She was working hard just the 3rd row is almost impossible to reach. The owner got up and did an opening which was good and the headliner was really really good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"An entertaining evening We had a ton of fun and will go again. We also enjoyed eating at the attached restaurant first- however this made our eventual entrance into the club really confusing disorganized and a bit of a cluster. It worked out fine though."}
{"text":"Love Howard, had a great time, happy birthday sir! Thanks for bringing comedy with emotion to the valley,You will be missed, yet I know you won't be far away. What a great evening!"}
{"text":"This comedy club is a great place to have a casual friends night out or to take a visiting friend. The comedians are surprising and diverse in what they choose to speak about with the audience, but the highlight is how relatable their acts are. From the openers to the club owner to the headliner himself, this show was a great experience, and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Had a BLAST!!!! Comedians were hysterical host was really great as well. Definitely worth going here."}
{"text":"The old spot was great but this new location is pretty sweet!! Great service, friendly staff, average pricing, comfortable seating and all around a great experience!!! The only down fall was the front waiting area is a little small and got a bit crowded as the time came for the hostess to start seating everyone. Much better vibe here then any of the other local comedy spots!! The Nick Guerra show was outstanding!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time to this club. Came with a work party and had a great time. We'd originally planned on doing drinks/dinner at another restaurant but decided to save ourselves the trouble of parking twice. Papi Chulo's was a nice starter to a good evening. Great service from Chris and decent prices on food and drinks. Plus you get 15% off your bill when you are going to the comedy club.  As mentioned the venue was very intimate, but worked well. The lighting was great. The room sat a fair number of people, but didn't feel crowded. The stage was decorated nicely and let you feel like you were having a personal conversation with a really funny friend.  The service from entrance to exit was phenomenal. There was always someone handy to help and you never had to ask for something twice. Pricing was also reasonable and a two ITEM limit means you don't have to have drinks you may not really want. We did deserts.  The show lasts about 1 1/2 hours but it moves fast and is entertaining. Howard does a great warm up and the acts up to the headliner are funny. Granted humor is subjective, but all the comics did a good job of mixing it up enough that you'd find something funny.  Overall this was a really good experience."}
{"text":"I thought this was supposed to be a Laugh Factory now? What happened? I noticed that there is actually a Laugh Factory in Scottsdale, but it's a different address..."}
{"text":"atmosphere was amazing host was awesome food was great .. I would def recommend this place and will visit again .."}
{"text":"BEST place in town. It's small, intimate and FUNNY. Nothing worse than going to a comedy club and you don't think the comedians are funny. We've gone a few times now and every time we went the comedians were great. The owner is super nice and personable, he walks around and talks to people, makes everyone feel like family no matter who you are. Great place for company outings, date nights or to celebrate your birthday. The service staff is awesome as well. I highly recommend this place over the bigger comedy clubs. Bring your friends (girls, make sure you wear water proof mascara) and be ready for a great time! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We went Thursday night 3/16/2017. Once again Howard killed it! We started the night off being greeted by Lisa who showed us to our seats. We orders drinks & the guacamole (7 avocados were killed making it the menu stated) it did not disappoint. Howard was funny and entertained the entire crowd with new witty material. The headliner was Chris Porter who is always amazing! His ability to interact with the audience (even the tools in the back) is something to be seen. We will be back before they close the doors after April. I hope Howard finds a new location, and continues to deliever stand up comedy to the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"Attended tonight's show starring Jared Logan. Had the best laugh ever in any comedy club experience. The owner and opener was just as funny and made the whole night a great time. Food before the show at the adjoining restaurant was excellent. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hilarious. We have been here multiple times and every time i laugh more. The owner Howard Hughes is always hysterical and fortunately, he takes the stage every night. Headliner last night was one of the best I have ever seen. Great location. This comedy club is top notch."}
{"text":"Great show with a hilarious host and owner, this funny dude Howard Hughes! Opening acts were decent, Howard killed it and the main act Gabriel Rutledge murdered it. This guy out of Seattle is hysterical! Small venue, as others have mentioned, but very fitting somehow.   The server Daniel, at the adjoining restaurant Papi Chulos, was a tad off his game but the food was great."}
{"text":"Took my husband for his birthday. I wanted to do something fun and different so we did dinner and the show! Far exceeded my expectations!! The food was very good (we had Fajitas) and the show was excellent!!! All of the comedians did a great job and Howard the host is great! The service was good and everyone was very friendly. I highly recommend this as a date night or get a group together and go!"}
{"text":"I love this club!!! Owner Howard Hughes showcases funny and relevant local talent as well as nationally recognized headliners. I've never been disappointed, always a fun night out at SUS. I'm looking forward to seeing Gary Gulman at the new location for his March show."}
{"text":"I have never been to a comedy club before and this one was a great choice! My husband and I really enjoyed the opening act by Howard as well as the featured comedian. The venue is cozy and there was a great mix of older and younger people in the audience. It was quite full for a Thursday night. We had a fantastic time and will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Love. The. New. Place. It's inside Papi Chulo's so the food is really delish. So much better than the other place at the old Anderson's. Sound is much better, IMO. And lest I not forget the BATHROOOMS (shout out, Howard!), they actually work lol! I will note that for opening night we did wait about 20 minutes or so before a server came over to us, however, once she took our order we had our food and drinks soon thereafter. I don't give them any points off for that because everything was new and there are always kinks to work out on the first night or two. Howard was as humorous as he always is. The comedians were really funny too. My friend and I had an enjoyable evening out!"}
{"text":"I was gettin used to the old spot but I gotta say the new spot is amazing inside. So intimate and convenient next door to the restaurant . The comedy is always impeccable, Howard Hughes and his crew absolutely hilarious. Love that guy and love this club! Definitely one of my favorite go-tos in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The venue holds about 100 people, so it is a great intimate setting.  Howard, the owner, opened the show, followed by a couple of friends, and then the man, Ryan Hamilton walked out and killed it.  The staff was friendly and attentive, and the comics were on.  My date and I were extremely pleased with our evening here.  Dont be hatin..."}
{"text":"Howard you're a trip and super funny ...and best part of our night.  We never expected 3 comedians that was  a great surprise Thanks for a fun evening. Drinks and dinner were great and reasonable but back to my 1st comment ...Howard stole the show!"}
{"text":"One star. Bernie rules.  Great show tonight. Great service. Can't remember a better comedy night out with friends."}
{"text":"Great place - adjacent to a good restaurant, and they let you buy alcohol at the bar and bring it into the area where the show is at. The owner is hilarious, and their selection of the comedians is very good. My fiancé and I were on vacation in AZ, and decided to give it a try on a Valentine's Day night (he was not fond of the stand-up comedy shows until that night). Now, he is eager to go to another one! Definitely recommend to attend this place (we will also - next time we are in town!!)"}
{"text":"So fun. Laughed all night...my face hurts. Thanks! My husband and I don't get out much so I really appreciate our night. XOXO"}
{"text":"Came here about six months ago, and just now catching up on reviewing everything, but this place was great! The owner was funny and just the atmosphere allows you to really relax. The margaritas come with a kick as well ;)"}
{"text":"The intimate setting of the club is great and the drinks and food selection was on point too. The comedians were hilarious and the owner was welcoming and gracious as well."}
{"text":"Had an awesome night celebrating a friends birthday! Laughed all night, except for one act that most of us didn't really understand. The rest were hilarious and my cheeks hurt by the end of the night! My drink was delicious and the service was great. The host was super funny, too! I will be heading back, soon!!"}
{"text":"The comics I saw were okay, but on a Friday night the room was only about 1/4th filled and the crowd was into it but when you get a person that always needs to be in a conversation with a comedian it gets old really quick, I am surprised the female was not asked to leave the room and put a sock in it.  Unfortunately this place is okay, good comedians, staff is attentive and the snacks were passable.  Check it out for yourself if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Howard the owner is hilarious! The acts are great and the service is outstanding! Love this place"}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck in Scottsdale! The room isnt fancy, the stage isnt fancy but who cares! The selection of comedians are 5 stars. I have been to Howards old spot before and now his new one. Howard does a great job opening the show up."}
{"text":"Live comedy is always fun. The new location provides a very intimate environment to see local and traveling comics. Howard does an excellent job hosting, working the crowd, and creating an overall theme for the night. Plus, if you eat dinner at the adjacent Papi Chulos beforehand, you get 15% off your meal. Finally, there is no two drink minimum in the club (but it's still totally worth ordering a few cocktails/beers to accompany the laughs)."}
{"text":"Luv this club and the host Howard Hughes!!! Always a great time with great up and coming comics that fit Howard's style of comedy."}
{"text":"Nice venue and the comedy was first rate, from the host Howard, the featured comedian and the headliner all wonderful! Only 2 issues I had were lack of handicapped parking and some confusion on where to check in for the show. We had to go back to the lobby of the hotel that is a bit of a walk away, on the opposite side of the comedy club. If you're handicapped make sure someone else can drive and drop you off first."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun, my wife & I were laughing during the whole show.  It is a cozy quaint environment that adds to the experience.  We plan to make many more visits. Make a reservation @ Papi Chulo's before, then you can reserve your seat.  The food was excellent."}
{"text":"I don't have 1200+ reviews  as I do have a life but  we had a great time Saturday night seeing Chris Porter, Jose Sarduy and Rishi Arya. Howard did a small set and all four had us in stitches. Talked with Howard after the show briefly about Taffer and he came off pretty genuine. Will definitely make a return."}
{"text":"This club is awesome. I go often and I am never bored. They always have new comedians. Laughter is an awesome medicine to relax and improve the mood.  In my opinion, no one beats this place!"}
{"text":"I like the small venue and good talent. Like all comedy joints the drinks ain't cheap, but they are worth it for the laughs"}
{"text":"Stand Up Live on 02/18 at the 7:30 show was outstanding.  The staff did have to scramble to get to everyone seated properly but it was handled well and the crowd was all easygoing about it.   Howard's strength is being a wild and crazy emcee and his work in getting the crowd livened up was terrific.   To Howard:  I wish you the best with the club wherever it may be.  Keep it up.  There are a lot of people in town who appreciate having your kind of entertainment available."}
{"text":"This establishment is unorganized, getting seated was a complete mess. Then once the show started, I've never seen so many people leave a show out of disgust. The owners (or so the stated to a member of my group) in front of us (a female with short blonde hair and a red open shoulder shirt) with a bald gentleman in a black shirt were so rude and bullied the people in front of us..I can't believe an establishment would be run like this..two brawls were started and about 10-15 people left before the main show even started. I wish I could have enjoyed the show as I thought both Howard and the main comedian were hilarious...things need to change or at least the way they treat people...as it was distracting watching them taunt people in front of us the whole show..."}
{"text":"I wrote a review a few years ago and it wasn't good. Howard had blasted me back for numerous things and I blasted him about. I let it go at that and decided I just wouldn't go to his club ever again. Fast forward a few years and my friend gets tickets to see Kevin Farley. I agree to give it another shot and I'm sooooo glad I did. Howard NAILED IT! I was laughing like crazy! I found myself being happy for him and really enjoyed it! Kevin Farley was hilarious as well and just as Im thinking....ok, I cant wait to come again....Howard breaks the sad news that they're closing.  I look for forward to the new spot, wherever it may land, and hope you enjoy your time off with the girlfriend and stids. Cheers Howard!"}
{"text":"Visted for the first time last night and saw Joe Matarese. Not only was the headliner entertaining but ALL the comics had us in stitches! Great comedy in a cozy venue! Highly recommend seeing a show there.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Second time here. Great time. Great service. 4 stars just because the seats are tough on my big fat ass."}
{"text":"Had a great time and lots of laughs - got to see a fav: Chris Porter!  Thanks for a great night out. Servers were busting a$$ for a packed house- but we enjoyed our drinks and food and didn't blow a ton of cash."}
{"text":"Howard says Bar Rescue is a fraud?  From I see he is worse.   Look at these staged 5 star \"reviews\".  Nothing about the food or quality of the drinks (like the real 4/3 stars) but all \"scripted\" copies of the  other 5 star text saying the same  basic thing--all about having a \"good time\" ( WTF does that mean?) and what a swell guy Howard Hughes is.  Problem is how many  real customers would know Howard runs the place if they were not his close pals or people who worked there?  When you go to Burger King to you do a review of the burger NOT  what a swell guy the owner is!  This ex-Marine section #8 isn't fooling me and don't let him fool you! FAKE FAKE!  Take a  lesson here folks:  Anytime you see a cluster of 5-star reviews  on ANY business be assured  there is something fishy going on."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's been great each time. Great value, several acts, all funny. Even if you don't know who is performing, it seems its always great."}
{"text":"I have been to this club three times in the last couple months. It is amazing. Howard does a great job on stage and off. Would highly recommend this to anyone that loves to laugh. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I don't know how to describe this place or the owner so I'll just write exactly what I tell friends before I take them here.   \"I'm really hoping the owner, Howard, goes on the stage because he is always the best thing about the show. He just starts talking...rambling...making slight fun of people and then you realize its actually his way of doing stand up and you are totally hooked because he is so unique.\"   I've been here about 8 times now and keep coming back because its perfect!  Take friends here, don't worry about it not being some big fancy place when you walk in, and enjoy a night of comedy!"}
