{"text":"Consistently good sushi for a quick lunch. You can either take it to-go or eat-in in the  less than 20 table dining area. May have given it a slightly higher rating but there isn't a tempura selection. Regardless, a good quick sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Super excited to finally have a sushi restaurant in Aurora that doesn't gouge you on prices and skimp on quality and quantity.  The shop is small but in a way it's good so it keeps their overhead down.  I don't write many reviews so when I do, it's because I'm quite excited about the establishment. I ordered the Take Combo (26pcs) and a Rainbow Dragon Roll (9pcs) for take out. The portions were very generous as were the roll sizes!  Prices all include tax already. Mine came out to $44.  Way better in value than other sushi restaurants in the area.  As if this wasn't good enough already, they have a frequent buyer card where you get 1 stamp for every $10 spent. 10 stamps get you a free dynamite roll!  Keep it up, Yamato Sushi!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  This restaurant specializes in sushi. Similar in type to Sushi Bong and Gals' Sushi.  Primarily a takeout place, but they do have a few seats.   They really make the rolls well and they don't skimp, unlike other places that use much more rice than filling.  I like that they are flexible and allow you to choose what type of rolls you want in your platter.  Their prices are fair, especially in comparison to other sushi places in the area.   I hope they stay around, as they are our default sushi place in the area!  Food tried: Sushi roll platter Free spring rolls (they also offer other options)  Service: Excellent, no complaints"}
{"text":"it's simple. makes air canada food taste delicious. Miso soup - how on earth can one screw this up - tasted like the dishwater from yesterday's service with some cubes of stuff thrown in. The rest of the food could be described as an un-identifiable paste that coats your mouth until you can't perceive textures or flavors. The food is like edible Novocain."}
{"text":"Pros: - Good Service - Good Food - Good Ambiance  Cons: - You need a reservation on week-ends, otherwise you will have to wait.  Price could be considered a bit high compared to similar Restaurant in Montreal (Sushi is considered a luxury on the south shore)  Conclusion: I would go again, and try another dish (I had the Teriyaki Chicken, my Girlfriend has the Emperor Chicken)"}
{"text":"Love this sushi takeout place ! The sushi is good, rice is seasoned well and they use proper sushi rice. Rice to fish proportion is good too. Well priced. Very friendly owners. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"I  used to work just a block away from here so this used to be my frequent go to spot for sushi. So last week for a last minute lunch, a friend and I decided to hit Yamato up. (Great location, just at the end of the 7th St SW LRT station)  Tuesdays/Wednesdays are $1 sushi, so that was a nice bonus!   I think because I used to it and I love the sushi here, the decor and method of ordering doesn't bother me. (Ikea chairs and tables staggered to cater to the lunch crowd and the service staff don't really communicate much - maybe it's a language barrier?)  Our sushi & rolls come out pretty quick and we're able to eat, converse and settle our bill within the hour for our lunch break.  Although I've never had the chance, I've been told numerous times that the mousse cake desserts here are something worth trying. Maybe next time - I know I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable priced but bad service. Don't go here if you only have a one hour for lunch - I waited 35 to 40 minutes for my food. I ate two out three items I ordered in the restaurant but had to get the third to go because the third item came just as I had to leave to get back to work."}
{"text":"No fuss, no muss, no flair sushi. The portions are large and the sushi is fresh. They are pretty quick service wise.  There is zero ambiance here though. Tea comes in a paper cup and the seating area looks run down and cluttered. You choose your order off of a photocopied paper order sheet with no descriptions other than price. If you fill it out wrong or cross something out, the order lady scolds you a bit. She also randomly will cross off items that are unavailable, using  your pencil. It's a bit weird.  I'd go back because the quality is good. However for the price, I do expect a little more in terms of decor, presentation and service for a downtown lunch spot."}
{"text":"We were quite happy with our lunch specials. The rolls are generously sized with lots of filling and rice was not overdone. One roll was filling enough!  The place is small, but clean. Most orders seem to be for take out. We chose to sit in.  Quick service.  Will definitely be our go to place for a quick bite of sushi!"}
{"text":"Our new spot for sushi! It is delicious (love the spicy salmon roll) and good value for the quality you get. We spent over $30 and got a free appetizer which we chose gyoza and also delicious. We already filled up a stamp card. Will be a frequent customer. Worth a try for everyone"}
{"text":"Nous étions venu à ce resto dans une autre vie...  Ce soir:  Soupe Tom Yum crevette... Son bouillon est sans saveur, plein d'oignons et sans ce peitit goût de coco.  C'est pas les deux crevettes qui feront la différence.   Rouleaux impériaux: beaucoup trop de cinq épices avec une sauce amère franchement pas bonne.  Hey les boys, ya internet pour des suggestion de recettes.  Au tour des sushi:  que dire \"on mange d abord avec les yeux\" et il aurait fallu des clients aveugles.  La pire présentation de sushi de toute ma vie.  C'est comme une habit brune avec des bas blancs.  Leur look n'avait d égale que leur goût!  Unagi-nigiri sushi complètement froid ...  De plus les rouleaux étaient si \"loose\" que tout risquait l effondrement à tout momment.  Et j'en passe  OK, doggy bag.. Et cette fois ce sera vraiment pour Pitou!  Désolé pour le proprio hyper-sympathique que j ai reconnu du temps de DaGiovani... Vous avez besoins monsieur de nouveau chef.  Tennons nous loins."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a while now, but we were a little hesitant because it looked small and didn't seem like there was much seating. However, what they lack in seating, they make up for in food! We were so impressed by the size of their rolls. We got the yamato lunch ($18), includes 5 pieces of sushi, 6 pieces of sashimi and your choice of a set selection of rolls (we got the dynamite). We also got the Orangeville roll ($18), which is spicy salmon and scallops, topped with MORE salmon! But what really makes us want to go back is the fact that their fish is very fresh and they give big pieces, whereas some other sushi places give more rice instead of fish. To top it all off, their pricing includes taxes, so we paid a flat fee of $36. If you're looking for a bang for your buck, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Always good quality sushi and great service. Give yourself some time on the weekends when ordering because it might take 30 minutes +."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here based on the good reviews, but having moved back home to Aurora after living in Toronto for several years, I'm finding the reviews of sushi places here are generally ridiculously high for very poor quality sushi. I'm not expecting Miku levels of quality from every takeout place, but I ended up throwing out most of my dinner here.  Got take-out here for dinner a few nights ago. Firstly, all of the rolls were HUGE, to the point that they were way too big to have in a single bite, and difficult to have in 2 bites. This is very challenging when eating with chopsticks--maki should be bite-sized. Never had rolls even half this big at any other sushi place.  The spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls were inedible. They were of the style where the salmon/tuna, mayo, and tempura \"crunch\" are all mixed up into a completely homogenous mixture and rolled up. The mix was extremely dry, even copious amounts of soy sauce didn't make it taste moist. Very unpleasant to eat. The rice was also dry and the seaweed was very tough and hard to chew. There didn't seem to be much fish in them, or it was ground up way too fine to notice. The tempura \"crunch\" bits were completely soggy and not at all crunchy, they added no texture to the rolls and were mixed up with everything else.  Also, the salmon in the salmon avocado roll was not fresh. I will say that the avocado was some of the best avocado I've ever had, but I had to throw the salmon in the green bin. Since the spicy rolls were all mixed up I can't speak to the quality of the fish in them, what little there was, but I don't imagine it was any better.  Finally, it's very difficult to find parking in this lot at many times, moreso in the sprint/summer/fall due to the ice cream shop, and it's extremely difficult to get out as you can only exit northbound or eastbound, if you want to head west it's very difficult to exit north and cut 3 lanes over to turn left, and if you want to head south then you have to take an extremely long detour."}
{"text":"Good portion and tasty take out sushi place in Aurora! Good customer service! We have the spring roll and seaweed salad for free, yummy and nice too! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Order the seafood salad shrimp, crab and little tiny pieces of lobster. Where are they? The dressing was zesty, just the way I like the dressing. Not bad for $8.95.  For my main entree I order a paradise roll $12.95 crab, shrimp, roe, asparagus and deep fried. What a disappointment, I thought it was going to be this 8 section fatty roll but it was a scrawny roll.  Portions were small and I was hungry. I'll keep looking for more Japanese restuarants in Montreal."}
{"text":"Sushi quality was high ,  service was friendly and staff appreciative of my business .  One of the better sushi places in Aurora!"}
{"text":"The guys are trying hard, but the sushi is below par, and in some cases worse than supermarket variety (the sushi at Longo's is way better than this). Having had 3 different rolls, I know it's not an accident.   Adding insult to injury, they are priced similarly to some of the best sushi joints in the northern part of the GTA.   Not a repeat, under any circumstances."}
{"text":"I want to say.. THANK YOU CHERRIE for taking me to this place in your hood! We came here recently and ordered a $30 sushi platter, which comes with 4 rolls of your choice and they range from 6 to 8 pieces depending on what roll you get.  So you are getting 30 pieces of sushi for $30 which is an amazing deal!  Wait there's more! If you order $30, they give you a free appetizer, your choice of either salads or gyoza!   Sushi rolls are large and the ingredients taste fresh, staff are super friendly and I was very surprised they gave us 6 gyoza when it's free! I will definitely be back again when I'm in the area and I'll make sure I drag Cherrie out with me as well!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for affordable priced sushi for a quick bite. The rolls are abundantly stuffed and their sashimi is pretty fresh. They have a pretty good selection of lunch specials as well. However for the past 2/3 times of ordering, there was always some problem. For the first one, they got my order wrong and insisted that I did in fact say the wrong order detail, which I found rude because I know I didn't and my partner heard me as well. The second is when I opened the box and there was a fin/plastic-like tiny black thing on top of my sushi and I have no idea what it was (its in my picture). Regardless both experiences were not pleasant and hopefully if I do order from them the next time, there won't be any problems."}
{"text":"Great new sushi spot! Fresh, tasty and a lot of options to choose from. Very clean (they are brand new), customer service is excellent. We will definitely be visiting again, prices are good (fair, greater value than other sushi spots in the area) and the location is convenient.  All rolls that we ordered were delicious (salmon, unagi, rainbow dragon roll)   As a special for the first week from opening, customers get 1 roll for free with their order. We received spicy salmon roll, delicious!"}
{"text":"Good sushi.  Ok so we've been back a few times now.  Tried a few rolls.  These guys make good sushi. Would definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"I've ordered the sushi platter for $30.00.  It was subpar at best, and I can only compare them with Supermarket type quality.  I go to my two favorite Japanese restaurants within the area at least twice a month, and it looks like I'll continue that trend..."}
{"text":"Parking: 1/5 Dining Area: 3/5 Kitchen Speed: 4/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Convenience: 5/5 Service: 3/5 Value: 3/5  For quick downtown lunch sushi, Yamato is a good choice if you're on the west side of downtown.  This is clearly the target client as there is no parking (its on the C-Train line) and the dining area is a half hearted attempt to have you stay.  The sushi is above average for lunch time take out, but far below average compared to real sushi restaurants across the city.  The kitchen is pretty quick which is a must for the downtown lunch crowd, but service is really hit and miss.  Sometimes you get a cheerful person that makes you feel like going here was a good choice and they're happy you came.  Sometimes you get the crabby lady from the take out window in \"Dumb and Dumber\" and you feel like she's annoyed you walked in.  For the price they're asking they should do MUCH BETTER.  Move her to the back office role (I suspect she's the manager or owner) and this place would immediately be a 4/5 at least.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"New spot in just opened .. tried it for lunch after a workout. Great spot .. quick and very good sushi. Everything tasted great, I don't need an fancy setting to get good food. They are going after the take out crowd .. so I will try that next week."}
{"text":"All they do is rolls, so if you're expecting anything really authentic, you'll be disappointed.  Also, they're big on sauces and filler to make their rolls look more substantial and impressive.  Good sushi doesn't need this kind of treatment.  I'm always concerned when I see sushi covered in sauce.  There are better choices in the area and the prices here aren't cheap either.  Not likely we'll be back."}
{"text":"Opened just a few months ago, Yamato Sushi is already popular AF in the Aurora neighbourhood! In a short period of time, Yamato has captured a loyal local customer base :) My husband is obsessed with this place, and we frequent at least once a week.  For a take-out sushi joint, the menu prices are very reasonable, lunch special prices are even better, service is friendly and the food order comes out SUPER FAST - a 27 piece small sushi party tray with 3 different kinds of sushi rolls can be done in 10 minutes - who does it in that speed!   Yamato mainly specializes in sushi rolls. You can also have the chef torch your rolls upon request! My favourite sushi roll would probably be the Scallop Roll ^^  You will also receive a stamp for every $10 purchase. Once you filled 10 stamps on your card, you can redeem a free Dynamite Roll. And when you spend $30 or over, you will receive free appetizer(s) on the house as well!  The only con I have at this time is that the sushi rice goes really hard overnight in the fridge! So make sure you eat them fresh and not leave any leftovers!  Side notes: It is located in the same plaza as Levetto Aurora, Chocolats Favoris, and Sunny Morning Breakfast & Lunch (opening soon!). This small plaza has limited parking spots. Be sure to call in to order in advance, and have someone drop you off to pick up your order! Delivery is also availabile if you live in the area. If you do dine in, there is one table for 4, and a sushi bar area for 2-3 people."}
{"text":"The sushi here is really good and so is the customer service! The size of their rolls are also big. I work next door and I love coming here for my break especially since my order is usually ready in 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Very close by to my house, a perfect, fast and yummy sushi take out for impulsive cravings. Portions are generous, and the food tastes fresh. Service was fast, prompt and very patient."}
{"text":"This is mainly a takeout restaurant with only 1 table for 4 and a few barstools. I ordered the medium combination platter $83 which came with 3 appetizers. I chose miso soup, Wakame salad and spring rolls. The sushi was really fresh! The only downside is the fish on the sushi was very thin but the sashimi slices were a good thickness. Taxes included in the price. Get a stamp for every $10 you spend. After 9 stamps, you get a free dynamite roll. I will come back."}
{"text":"Super awesome takeout spot!! Great sushi ; and very good prices :)) our new takeout spot ; they also give stamps for regulars!!! Hope they stay fresh we're weekly sushi fans."}
{"text":"Quick in and out joint for sushi, had the edmame and baby octopus for lunch starter, and then onto the sake fresh salmon sushi (good) and the unagi (excellent), and then some spicy tuna rolls (good). Very fresh and definitely a potential repeat visit is required. Saw some of the udon."}
{"text":"It's the perfect little Japanese place for a quick bite of sushi or salmon don at lunchtime.  It's a reastaurant with no frills.  In and out, all it matters is good food.   The salmon sashimi are huge pieces!  I love the salmon sashimi here.    They also have other food items like udon, ramen, soba, bento boxes, yakisoba, takeout sushi, miso soup, gyoza, and lots of other mainstream Japanese dishes.    The menu is like a sushi list.  You check off what you want on the list.  Don't forget there is a Sushi/Sashimi Special ONLY on MONDAYS - buy 2 sushi/sashimi and get one free.  Great Deal!  Also, Tuesdays are Oyster Days!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow yelpers for this recommendation.  I went here just before closing to try some of the rolls. The torched dynamite roll is out of this world!!  Must try as was my favourite one and so unique.  My husbands favourite was the green dragon roll as they do it different from other places and in his words he thought he was eating popcorn lol.  I think what's different about theirs is that there is a sauce drizzled on top with some seeds, so good!  We tried their spicy tuna and it was very fresh and good big portions.  Although it may be a little pricier than other sushi places, it is fresh, delicious and great service.  I will definitely try it again as now I want to also order more rolls from their symbol menu and experiment with the torched rolls.  Again be sure to order a torched roll!! You will not regret it."}
