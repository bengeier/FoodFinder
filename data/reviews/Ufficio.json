{"text":"Wow! Amazing food and staff. Perfect night.  Went for work party and we were all very impressed. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this restaurant for a long time and finally decided to give its $38 three course Summerlicious menu a try.  Unfortunately I had a disappointing experience where the delicious food was overshadowed by less-than-stellar service.

We had an early reservation so were immediately seated when we arrived.  The restaurant is small but is smartly decorated.  I especially liked the big fishing net hung on the wall.

The food was consistently excellent.  Highlights include the Swordfish Crudo app and the Grilled Octopus main.  Both were fresh, flavorful, beautifully plated, and came in a good sized portion.  The Panna Cotta and Polenta Cake were also delicious and more filling than they first appeared.  

We also sampled a couple of their cocktails.  Both were good and at around $15 each they were consistent with cocktails I've ordered from other restaurants of this caliber.

The service, on the other hand, was a big let-down and does not reflect many of the positive reviews that I have read here.  One of our mains arrived a good 7-10 minutes before the other, which resulted in a lot of awkward staring between my dining companion and I.  It turns out the same thing happened to the next table as well.  After the second dish finally arrived, our waiter explained that the orders of our two tables were somehow mixed up on the same ticket.  While mistakes do happen, it would've been nice if this was communicated to us earlier.

Later, one of the two-top tables next to us was removed and we were told they wanted to spread the tables out so that everyone could have more room.  As I stood up thinking that this was very thoughtful, the staff walked away and it turned out we were expected to move the table ourselves.  Not a huge deal, but I can see myself knocking glasses over and dropping cutlery on the floor had I had a couple more drinks in me.

While the servers were sometimes attentive, I had trouble trying to get their attention because they were too focused on their conversation at the bar.  My water glass was consistently filled but my companion found it weird that her's was not.  I will second Jennifer K's observation of the staff's \"Bohemian vibe\".  It felt like they are doing and saying everything on the checklist but they weren't 100% mentally present.

To cap off the evening, we were charged for wine that we did not order.  This was quickly corrected when I pointed it out.

According to Yelp, 2 stars is \"meh, I've experienced better\" and this perfectly describes my experience at Ufficio.   I have had better service at hole-in-the-wall joints in Scarborough and I certainly expected more from a much hyped restaurant in a trendy neighbourhood. 

Some may say underwhelming service a symptom of the Summerlicious program and things will go back to normal after it is over.  I won't be coming back to find out."}
{"text":"My 4th visit in 2 months! Beautiful room, fabulous food, great service! Start with the tuna and grilled bread, go for the octopus and finish with the amazing olive oil cake or panna cotta! Though I don't drink myself, they also offer a stellar list of handcrafted cocktails and non-alcoholic beverages. 
Excellent from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Went to diner on a Wednesday night. Amazing vibe! We were lucky to find out its oyster night at 1 dollar a shuck. They PEI oysters were so fresh. 

We had a very warm server who walked through the whole menu with us and we decided  to just let her order for the two of us and shared each dish. I highly recommend doing it this way!!  Every dish was insane!!

We had the zucchini flower appetizer followed with a stuffed mushroom home made ravioli with truffle butter (a must have!!) oh ya and a sword fish and pine nut dish, like a thin sliced ceviche that i could eat every night! 

For the main we split the grilled octopus. It was nicely charred and so so tender.

ohhh wait i almost forgot, we ALSO had the burrata that sat on a pistachio puree and had some small beets around it... honestly it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.

Ill be back a lot, even just to eat at the bar. The decor is beautiful, stylish but warm and welcoming the service was so friendly and they really seem excited about the food they serve."}
{"text":"We got 4 petite girls. Ordered a salad, a crudo, 3 pasta and 1 octopus main and 2 desserts and a bottle of wine. Flavors are good, well cooked but the portion is tiny (like appetizer size). We were still hungry after our meal that we were discussing where to go next for our second meal or snack.  Will we come back? Probably not...."}
{"text":"Ate dinner at Ufficio last night with my daughter. I highly recommend Ufficio. The servers really know their food which highlights the coastal regions in Italy. 
And the food! We had swordfish appetizer with chilies and pine nuts. It melts in your mouth. I had a dark pasta with seafood and chunky bits of tomato and onions. Lovely combination of flavours. My daughter had sea bass which was cooked to perfection.
We both tried a terrific white wine from the Piedmont area which the manager told us was from grapes grown at the foot of the Alps.
Officio is a warmly welcoming and visually stunning addition to Ossington and Dundas restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Their AGNOLOTTI DI MAIS and CONSERVA DI TONNO were to die for.. I went there with my future Sister In Law. We ordered the above mentioned along with GNOCCHI POMODORO and INSALATA DI CARCIOFI. Let's just say we ordered another plate of AGNOLOTTI DI MAIS and CONSERVA DI TONNO. The servers there are super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"So good, next level seafood. Mine was perfectly cooked, tender and flavourful, a new experience. The herb puree was so refreshing and it lifted the dish to something special. Girlfriend had a house made truffle stuffed pasta. It had the perfect degree of earthy truffle flavour. The inside was creamy and rich, the sauce light and balanced. Staff were friendly, cute, and knowledgeable. The owner even came buy for a chat. Totally friendly, totally delicious.

Welcome to the office!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, atmosphere and most of all delicious and imaginative dishes. We were there for brunch and I have to say I cannot remember a better brunch ever in Toronto!!! We will be back again and again to experience dinner!"}
{"text":"We started with oyster and cocktails.Both were very good.
The octopus dish and the pasta were also so tasty. I will defiantly try the octopus dish again.
And finally for dessert the chocolate budino was delicious.
I absolutely liked the decoration and design of the restaurant. Defiantly recommended."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight with a couple friends. The place is busy and I don't know why. The food is seriously overpriced and way under portioned. They charge for bread, the oysters were tiny, the portions were ridiculously small, the pasta dish was barely a small handful. I was actually angry looking at what they have the nerve to serve for what they charge. On top of it the owner is constantly over at your table asking if you're ok...leave that to your waitress. It gets to a point where the constant interruptions become a bother.  Not sure what else to say about this place, but I would certainly not refer anyone here, in fact quite the contrary...I would dissuade them from going. Money not well spent."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  Every dish was perfectly cooked and executed, very thoughtfully designed. Must try; house made fresh agnolotti, albacore tuna crudo, fig and grilled radicchio salad and their house made focaccia!!! Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner last night and I wanted to write my review right away.  We started with a dozen oysters on the half shell, expertly shucked by a knowledgeable staff member who personally delivered and explained the origins and qualities of the oysters.

To pair the the oysters, I had a glass of the Stephen Parr Cremant ($14), and my boyfriend had the cucumber water gin caesar ($15).  The caesar was incredible and the bartender, Adam, told me how to make cucumber water and was very attentive and informative throughout the night.

We were planning on a full meal but were so taken by the first five items on the menu that we didn't get to the larger dishes (though we will be back.)   We had a single zucchini blossom stuffed with lemon ricotta, lightly breaded and fried.  It sat on top of lightly fried zucchini slices and some small pieces of a smelt served with arugula chili ($15).

We also ordered the squid ink arancini with pomodoro sauce and fried basil ($12) - I usually find arancini one dimensional, but this was superb and the pomodoro was perfect and fresh.  We also ordered to thick slices of focaccia ($3) to mop up the rest of the pomodoro sauce.  

At this point my boyfriend had the tequila caesar ($15) and I had a glass of pinot nero ($16).  We finished our meal with Shishito Peppers with lemon aioli ($10) and were quite full.

We plan to return to try the Swordfish Crudo ($14),  the porchini agnoletti ($21), the whole seabream ($32), and more oysters! 

The evening was perfect and we hardly EVER dine out so this was a true treat for us!"}
{"text":"Located in Little Portugal, I passed by this restaurant as they were preparing/training for their opening night (Jan 5th). I could smell the food prep from outside and it seemed fantastic; I like the focus on Vegetarian and seafood options. 

On opening night it was fairly busy, a good sign given the post-holidays lull. We tried an item from each area on the opening night menu: the Ontario burrata, trota scotato, Saltspring mussels on a chickpea fritter, the scallops, broccolini with parmesan, cauliflower with mint and goat cheese, and for dessert: the milk pudding with caramel popcorn.

The food was fantastic with a good wine pairing. The ambience great (not too loud/not too quiet), and the people friendly. Overall: a great opening night. I would definitely return for the burrata."}
{"text":"I won a gift certificate from a radio station and I came here with my family and relatives.  My family only eats Chinese food, so the gift certificate was a chance for them to try something other than Chinese food. The service was very good. The waitresses were so nice. The food was delicious! My family enjoyed their dishes. Though I guess the only thing would be about the ravioli was that the portion was too small. A family member mentioned they wouldn't have minded if the dish had more pieces and if it jumped in price just to account for that. I ordered the octopus and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and environment, it's a lovely date night spot. The service was also great which added to the ambiance. Food wise I preferred the seafood dishes over the pasta ones (normally I love pasta) because they had more flavour. The octopus entree is recommended as well as scallops if they are on the menu, it was the daily special that night. Usually the main ingredient makes the dish but for these2, I think the many other ingredients incorporated to elevate the taste made the difference!"}
{"text":"I dunno man. They serve beemster. I can get beemster at loblaws. That ain't right. That just ain't right. (Unless, like, Lawblaws is a way more awesomer place than I have ever realized. Geez, I oughta dress up more next time I go I guess.) 

Competent cooking, but playing it real safe. Beet salad, roasted cauliflower, shishito with aioli, octopus with romesco. 

I think these guys could probably take some more risks and we'd have something real great. That said: If you do not think a beet salad is at all boring then this may be right up your alley. I'm not the great arbiter of what boring is. I do--however--know that beemster is no kind of fancy special cheese."}
{"text":"As a self-declared meatatarian, I was a little skeptical of coming to a place that would not have a big juicy steak on the menu. However, I've been to Ufficio a few times now and I absolutely LOVE their brunch menu. Not only is the food well presented but it is a very appropriate atmosphere for brunch - my girlfriends and I literally spent 3 hours brunching and didn't even notice! Highlights of the brunch menu would be the Polpo Benny (Octopus Eggs Benny) and the smoked salmon scrambled eggs (not sure what it's called). We also tried the fish sandwich which was more like a fish burger and it was surprisingly good as well.  

Pescatarian or not, I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"My family of 5 and I traveled to Toronto for a weekend getaway. Very last minute, we decided to go out to dinner and stumbled upon Ufficio. So glad we did. Food was AMAZING, and extremely reasonably priced. My son (who is the pickiest eater around) loved every bite...as did the rest of us! Definitely a must when visiting the city. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Ufficio is goals. Period. 
The décor, the booths, the menu, the vibe, there is nothing it can't do. Giving me all the nautical chic vibes. 
One of my most favorite meals in Toronto to date, so happy I went there for my birthday. The staff is so accommodating and went above and beyond. Suggesting us a table for good photos, recommendations and hey- sending over a shot doesn't hurt either. It was the first time I didn't have to scan a menu for the \"pescatarian\"/vegetarian options, as that's exactly what Ufficio's menu is.  If you do it you gotta do it right: Oysters, Trout Crudo, Focaccia, Shishito Peppers, Burrata, Insalata D'ivana, and the Risotto should do.  Don't forget to check out their cocktail list, I would hate for you to miss out on the Picante Pasini."}
{"text":"I tend to do my research before choosing a restaurant, and Ufficio seemed to be a fav for many, so off we went. Well, it was an amazing meal, with amazing service, and amazing staff. Not one thing fell down here. Not one. The design of the space itself is beautiful. Everything works together to provide a sense of welcome, trendy, functional and fun. The cocktail menu was so creative, and watching the bartender do his thing? He was SO focused, and tested until the taste was just so. Our drinks were unique, and perfection, including the glassware used. The food? Don't get me started :) Everything was farm-fresh, perfectly prepared, stunningly plated. From the focaccia and burrata, to the tuna crudo, to the corn ravioli, to the octupus, and on through the desserts. I could find not one thing to criticize here. Not one. The wine list, by the way, is varied and thoughtful as well. And....loved the varied sound tracks in the background music. High energy, current, spot on. Love you, Ufficio!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favourite restaurants in Toronto.  Not only is the place super cute, but the service is fantastic, the presentation is beautiful, and the food is so good! I came for brunch and I can't wait to come back and try dinner here.  

-eggs benny: This was my first time having an octopus eggs benedict (house made english muffin, poached eggs, grilled octopus, hollandaise, romesco, anaheim chilis) and it was simply FAN-TASTIC.  I am not a fan of hollandaise sauce but because every single element of this dish worked together so well that I was clearing the plate of every last drop at the end. The octopus was fresh and perfectly cooked.  I must come and eat this again!
-ontario burrata: I've had some pretty fantastic burrata in France and Italy so I have to say that this was really bad compared to what I'm used to.  Wouldn't get again.
-avocado toast : served with house made focaccia, avocado with ricotta & mascarpone, poached eggs.  Looks as good as it tastes :)
-chocolate caramel cake/tart:  This was nothing too spectacular, so I don't think I would try any of their other desserts."}
{"text":"Sadly, Ufficio did not live up to the hype. A friend recommended this place and I made a reservation (knowing it was new and all the rage).

They seated us 30 minutes after arriving (on time for our reservation) and then it took 10 to 15 minutes for someone to take a drink order. This of course happened after I flagged down anyone remotely connected with the resto. 

My dinner date could see my frustration growing with every minute. I'm always willing to give a new place a chance if the food is worth it and I told him just that whilst waiting for our drinks to arrive. It took 15 minutes or so to get our drinks. I had forgotten if we had even ordered appetizers or asked about their menu. Nope. Keep in mind this is an hour after we arrived.

Along with the delayed seating and being ignored by the staff, we were juggled from our seats not once, but twice. Again, willing to let all these newbie hiccups slide... if the food was sensational. Nope again. We tried the ahi tuna, which barely tasted like tuna. The flavours within the dish seemed odd and not a good mix. We're both tuna freaks, so I feel we were let down some. We had to ask about our marinated olives (app) as they were forgotten, but arrived just in time as our mains. 

My partner had the trout whilst I had the octopus (sans dairy). Btw, I had mentioned the dairy intolerance at the time of booking and was told to let our server know, which I did. She mentioned the dishes could be made without dairy, but I had to settle with my third choice (octopus) for that possibility. The trout was average as was the octopus. I was hoping for a Hail Mary, but was disappointed. 

OH WAIT!! My cocktail was amazing!! I had the Cosmonaut (huge fan of shrubs). It was delish. Too bad alcohol isn't filling... satisfying, but not filling.

A tip for the owner(s). Please teach your staff 'awareness'. Restaurant goers shouldn't have to wait as we did. Also, it may be in your best interest to hire someone who knows how to seat patrons. Timing is everything and it really is an art. Servers should be familiar with items on the menu, too. Trust me, I was not far off from a case of the hangries.

There are far too many places to eat in this city and therefore we won't be returning."}
{"text":"A rather unprepossessing sort of place, with a very long bar near the front and shallow width for the tables. The ambience is very laid-back, with brick walls and not much in the way of sound absorption. So when it gets full, the noise level is unacceptably high.

The service is swift, informed and elegant. The kitchen is open at the back of the restaurant, and is obviously full of very enthusiastic young chefs.

The wine list is appalling. Apparently they are about to change it significantly. We were able to find a decent Sancerre, a tad expensive at $95 but as for the Reds, forget it.

The food, on the other hand is excellent. 

We started with small shrimp in garlic and salsa verde. Wonderful, beautifully cooked, and slightly crisp, much better than the squid and large shrimp which it replaced on the menu.

We had an oyster mushroom, shaved asparagus type salad which was plenty to share, and although the dressing was a bit indifferent the textures were very interesting and enjoyable.

We then had an outstanding fettuccine of lobster, shrimp, crab, with Parmesan on top. crème fraîche, tomato base. Extraordinarily tasty, and beautifully executed.

We ended with the halibut which was a small portion, as always; hot, crispy, well cooked, and lovely.

The cocktail of the day at $17 was good but exploitative in price. They tried to charge us $40 for corkage which is outrageous, and reduced it to $30 which is still high. They need to learn that they cannot overtly fleece their customers and still survive.
Hence, the missing top star."}
{"text":"BEST customer service I have ever experienced in my LIFE. Thank you Ufficio, for the excellent food, service, and cocktails. Once we got to the restaurant, we were sat down at the bar while we waited for our table to clear up. Make a reservation, as this place gets pretty full. I made mine on open table. Anyways, as we ordered our cocktails and got sat down in our table, we asked for the octopus bolognese. The waiter said that they had sold out for the night of that dish, and we were disappointed. I asked to speak with the manager, and told her we were visiting from the USA. Somehow she got the chef to make us the dish and it was honestly the best tasting pasta octopus dish I have ever had. The funghi pasta I had ordered was also out of this world, as well as the tuna crudo. Everything here was delicious, and the fact that they were able to make a dish for us that had been sold out, is just WOW. The price was also pretty good for such a nice restaurant. I definitely recommend coming here and again, thank you for making our experience in Toronto that much better!!"}
{"text":"We ate like kings. Stunning design (by Commute), friendly staff who already seemed well-versed in descriptions of ingredients and wine pairings despite our visit being the first Friday service, and utterly mind-blowing dishes. Try the grilled octopus and the dessert with the popcorn (don't ask what else was in it, because wine)."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the hype about the seafood here and to be honest I was a bit of disappointed. I ordered the octopus. Although it was tasty and the squid ink rice at the base was really good, it's not stella. If you have never had the octopus from Bar Isabel you would know what I mean. My friend had the ravioli and I believe it was a fish stuffing and dyed with squid ink to. Quite unique and tasty. All in all it's good experience but not sure if I would purposely come back."}
{"text":"First and last time here. Service was slow, pretentious, and obnoxious. Found a piece of tin foil in my pasta and not even an apology from the manager. They did comp the plate at the end, however I would have been fine paying for it had it was handled in a sincere way. The food was mediocre.

There are lots of better options for Italian food in this neighbourhood. I wouldn't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This was a bit hard to find from the outside. It says Ufficio in small letters on a vertical angle. Parking is great on the street. Walking in, this was a cozy spot for breakfast. Loved the open-concept layout where you can see the chef(s) making food in the back. The servers were friendly. This place opens at 11am on Sundays. We walked in right at 11 and it was pretty busy when we walked out. They take reservations, unlike a lot of the popular breakfast places in downtown. They take your coat when you walk in, which is a nice way to welcome someone.

Polpo Benny - Probably the best Benny I've had - one of the best. Definitely have never had a Benny with octopus with Hollandaise sauce that is creamy yet not overpowering (something someone else said to me before I tried this dish). The spices on top were the perfect ones to choose and didn't clash at all with the taste which was amazing since it was a savoy dish. 

SALMONE AFFUMICATO  - This was a recommended dish by the server. Not crazy about it. Was smoked salmon surrounded by scrambled eggs. Eggs were done to perfection but didn't see anything unique about this dish. Loved the capers as they added this amazing touch. The lack of uniqueness (in comparison to the Polpo) is why I gave a 4/5."}
{"text":"Hands down my fave new Italian spot in the city. Service was lovely and the ambience was very nice. If you're a designer, you'll appreciate the space. Lovely design choices. 

They have a wonderful drink selection with some interesting wines. The food is out of this world. The corn pasta was easily the best pasta I've ever had. Perfect flavor and texture combination. I'm already thinking about next time when I get to have it. 

Happy to see such a wonderful new space in our neighborhood. Looking forward to many meals there."}
{"text":"This place has been on the infamous list of restaurants to try for so long. Unfortunately I'm not overly familiar with this part of the city however, after a couple of glasses glasses of rosé at Mayfield, we walked over to Ufficio for our [late] reservation. 

The interior is very sweet. Darker (but not too dark), the tunes make you want to go dancing after and the gentleman that was helping us was super helpful and informative. 

Due to my wine consumption at the previous place, I decided to hydrate myself in the 30+ degree weather so I cannot comment on the list but my friends seemed to adore their choices. 

Portion sizes are fantastic, food was delish, service was phenomenal and overall I really enjoyed the vibe of this place.  

100% worth checking out! :)"}
{"text":"Ufficio caught my attention when I asker two chefs from another restaurant this question. Which restaurant would you dine and recommend. So since Winterlicious was on, I decided to give it a try. 

I like it how they use text to remind your reservations and when you respond they reply promptly too. This aspect is very good. 

From the Winterlicious menu,  I've selected the insalata di cavoletti di Bruxelles as the appetizer. Basically, it was shredded Brussels sprout with smoked mackerel. I did enjoy the smoked mackerel and can eat that as snack alone, but feel that the dish does not have enough dressing and I can't really taste the anchovy. 

Main course: Lasagne di Pesce- I can taste a few pieces of lobster and fresh crab meat. Having said that in between the layers, I find it bland. The top layer was too dry. This is a creative dish as you don't find seafood lasagna often. For my final course, the formaggio. There were four different types of cheese. I wish the waitress would tell me what each ones were. The guest beside me had the same problem, she flagged a waitress down to ask what one of the cheeses were. The response was like \"the soft one? I will go find out\" then she had to go back to ask. Anyways, I don't know if I set my expectations too high or again there is a difference  with Winterlicious standards."}
{"text":"Ufficio is very good ! Nice little spot definitely would recommend .

I had the rose ( dry ) for those who likes it ! I had the burrata - must try very good ! Amazing flavours def the best ive had .  Followed by shishito peppers and another must try because it is paired with garlic aioli which makes it different than other restaurants . 

The Brussel sprouts was highly recommended by our server and it was not good . We thought it would come crispy but it came drenched in oil and the flavour was a Miss ! Avoid avoid avoid ! 

I would definitely come back and try the octopus as i heard great things and the portions are quite generous even for sides ! Overall 4/5 dining experience !"}
{"text":"On first impression this is a cute little place. It is not very big inside and we were a large group so we got the area by the entrance. I have to say the seating was rather cozy - a bit too cozy for my liking to be honest. Our server was attentive in my opinion, not overly attentive, just the right amount - but she wasn't very personable at least that was my impression. 

We came here for dinner. We ordered some appetizers to share and then between D and I we ordered two entrees to share. For drinks I ordered a Sicilian Highball, which I really liked. Enjoyed my drink!! D ordered the Whiskey Sour, which I took a sip and wasn't crazy about because the whiskey flavor was just too strong. I only tasted whiskey. I liked my drink way better. As for the food, good selection on the menu and I was excited to try the things we ordered. However, the dishes were all just too salty for my taste. I found the cod to bee over cooked too because the fish was dry. The Octopus on the other hand was cooked just right, but again, way too salty. 

Service overall was average and the food was too salty so I am saying this place is average overall (I would say not quite a 2 nor a solid 3). There are some good things and some things that needs improvements. The one thing that I think they really need to pay attention to is how much sodium they put in their food. To me, if the food tasted good, I would consider a higher rating."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is quite nice, the servers are very attentive, and the food comes relatively quickly. Some of our dishes were great, but not all of them. Our overall dinning experience was good but not spectacular, and given the slightly higher than average price, I was expecting a bit more. Good to try once, but I can't see myself coming back here again given so many other restaurants of similar quality at cheaper price points. 

For the food, recommend getting the buratta and octopus. The buratta was a very nice soft cheese that was very flavorful and not salty. The octopus was super soft and tender and the portion was decent. 

The porchini agnolotti was delicious, with a very delicate mushroom stuffing and nice brown butter sauce. But at $24 for 8 tiny pieces, I wouldn't even consider it to be an appetizer portion let alone the main course it was supposed to be. So if you order this dish, you better chew slowly and savour every morcel since each bite is at least $3!

The bread we ordered with the buratta was soaked with butter to the point it was soggy, super salty, and completely charred on the grill. Always nice to eat the buratta with some bread, but that bread was so bad it ruined the delicate flavor of the cheese. Recommend asking them to go easy on the butter, salt, and skip the grill if you order the bread. 

The gnocchi was actually the worst dish of the night. Way too much flour mixed in with the potato, and the sauce had way too much cream that over-powered the rest of the dish. 

Overall, had a decent night with some great dishes, some so-so dishes, and a couple duds. Servers were great, open concept kitchen is nice, and atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"This review is for Winterlicious 2018 - 
First thing to note is that usually Ufficio is not open on Mondays or Tuesdays, but for -licious days it is open. Our table of 4 came for dinner with a reservation made weeks in advance and I would recommend a reservation because the restaurant is quite small and it does fill up. 

3.5/5 atmosphere - Very romantic, very... hip? The lighting is kept dim and the kitchen is open concept such that if you sat at tables near the kitchen end you can see everything. However, as the place is quite small, it gets pretty loud with everyone's conversations. The background music is not that overwhelmingly loud though, which is important because isn't it sooo annoying to have to yell at one another over loud music when trying to enjoy a lovely meal? My main criticism is that the tables are situated way too close together. Ufficio, you gotta get rid of some of those tables to make breathing space for existing customers.

4/5 food - Impeccable flavors and quality, but lost 1 star for serving such teeny, tiny portions! I ordered the vegan ribollita soup, which came with the best salty artisan bread ever, to start, followed by the lentils and cod as the main and polenta cake as dessert. The cod is to die for, so tender, so flavorful - especially the skin! Do yourself a huge favor and eat the fish skin. It's crispy and oozes with flavor. The pasta dishes were a bit disappointing however. AVOID ordering the vegetarian porcini pasta! It comes with like, 7 pieces. 

For dessert, the polenta cake was more moist than I would have liked and tasted kind of generic, like a cupcake. But the roasted pistachios scattered around the cake and fig compote were nice embellishments. I might opt for the hazelnut affogato next time.

Wonderful service. Dunno why so many previous reviews called out the service - we had a wonderful server who was both fast and respectful of our need for family time.

In conclusion, I won't be back again for -licious because the portions are too damn small, but I might be back to treat myself/date nights with the a la carte menu."}
{"text":"I went to Ufficio last night to try their winterlicous menu. I was really excited because I'd heard such great things but it turned out to be just meh. Nothing bad, but nothing that made me want to return either.

Food (3/5):
I started off with the Crudo, which was an interesting dish. The tuna was good but it was overwhelmed by the flavour of the salsa verde and pickled mushrooms. I was lucky because I got a fairly good portion of tuna but as the night wore on, I noticed the tables around me getting less and less, probably because they were starting to run out. My main was the Cavatelli, and while I did love the texture of the pasta shells, the smoked mackerel was a bit too salty. For dessert I had the Tiramisu Panna Cotta which was yummy. It had a great coffee flavour and the texture was super smooth. 
My boyfriend got the Zuppa del giorno, a vegetable puree soup, which was quite good. It was a bit on the sweet site like a butternut squash soup. For the main he had Cannelloni Di Zucca which tasted great but was a very small portion. He literally only got two pieces and I know he was still hungry afterwards. For dessert he had the pistachio gelato which was the highlight of the meal! Pistachio is his favourite flavour so we've tried it at a few places and Ufficio has one of the best. He also got a cappuccino which was small but reasonably priced at $3.50.

Atmosphere (2/5):
I would not recommend this place for a first date or any sort of intimate outing. While the lighting is romantic and the decorations are nice, the music is way to loud. Additionally, the tables are so close together that I was getting distracted by the conversations of the people next to me but I couldn't hear the person across from me. The tables were so closed together that in order for the person sitting on the inside to get out, you had to pull the table out. 

Service (3/5):
The service was okay. Someone was always walking by with a water pitcher so our glasses were always full but not once did someone ask us how any part of our meal was tasting or how we were doing."}
{"text":"Took a chance based on exceptional reviews. All three of us are foodies and were looking forward to a wonderful meal.  Made reservation on-line but wasn't on list when arrived. Eventually found our reservation. We were not welcomed, and shown to our table without any fanfare. First thing we noticed was that the staff all looked unhappy with some looking downright miserable. Order taken without any recommendations or pleasantries, generally service was indifferent. Food arrived without much of a wait but was overall underwhelming. Foccacia left a weird aftertaste. Summer squash blossoms a bit greasy. The tortelli di piselli was good and flavourful. The gnocchi in the gnocchi di mare was perfect - tender and melt in your mouth - but the accompanying sauce bland. Both main portions were very small (appetizer size) for $25 and $29 respectively. Disappointed, we decided to skip ordering additional food or dessert and left a bit hungry. We will not return."}
{"text":"Tried this place for sunmerlicious and it was amazing. I had the bread salad, spaghetti puttanesca and I forget which dessert but it all of them were amazing. Also had a drink called summer shrub and wow! Very strong and delicious. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Cute little cozy restaurant in the west end had a window seat quite comfortable and not noisy.  Service was prompt and server was good to explain her recommendations and deal with food allergy after it was brought up.  Now for the food it was good and portions were small to medium.   Part of the menu seems change so can try new dishes such as the swordfish  crudo which was quite good and refreshing d'ivava salad was also good very thin sliced salad, mushroom ravioli was a bit salty and small portion, the best dish was octopus very tender. 
Overall not a bad place for nice Italian seafood dishes"}
{"text":"I came to this place for winterlicious and I was pleasantly surprised that it's not your typical Italian type of restaurant. It looks fairly new and the decor is very modern with unique ideas thrown in. I absolutely loved the environment! Upon being seated the servers were all very friendly and offered to take our coats and bring us drinks. Most of the workers look younger but gave amazing service! The music was very 'millennial', lots of rap, hip hop and R&B which was awesome, all of it was new stuff too. The food offered was vegetarian, vegan or seafood options. All the menu items had a unique appeal and everything seemed fresh and homemade. The presentation and food that came out (not only to our table) all looked like a 5 star restaurant as if you were at a famous chef's place. I would never have expected the mix of 5 star food at a place that plays brand new drake tracks but if you're into that this is the place you want to be! It's a good mix of everything for young adults (but I would recommend it to every age group). The food was delicious! And you can make most of the vegetarian meals a vegan one which is super helpful. We met the owner?/general manager and she was very pleasant as well, everyone here seems very interested in making sure you enjoy your meal and time here. Also, water refills are constant which is great! They have a good wine selection (although pricey). Only reason for four stars was that we did wait quite a bit between each course, the kitchen seems pretty small so I'm not sure if they needed more chefs or if there was just limited output due to its size. Also the portions were quite small, especially for the cost even though it seemed 100% fresh ingredients it seems like there could have been more. After three courses I wasn't exactly 'stuffed' like I would've been at other places. Overall, I would still highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is very sleek, sexy seafood spot for sure.

The standout was the fish of the day, a massive trout served butterfly style accompanied by a generous helping of white bean cassoulet. The portion, as we were warned when we ordered it, was big enough for two to share.

The octopus entree was also excellent...beautifully prepared and very tender.

And the final highlight was the burrata, which we ordered with their amazing focaccia bread.

What wasn't so amazing was the pasta special...last night it was ricotta ravioli with chunks of lobster. The ravioli was dry (almost weirdly crispy) and the lobster was also overcooked. I didn't enjoy this dish at all. And the crudo of the day, which was tuna, was very tasty but a laughably small portion.

But overall, worth a try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience for our Valentines dinner! Very thoughtfully chosen wines that somehow paired well with our variety of dishes. The rapini and cauliflower dishes were outstanding, and the octopus dish perfectly cooked. Ended with the chocolate ganache which exceeded expectations! Staff were attentive and genuine. This is the real thing people!"}
{"text":"It took me a while to get round to write this review, so I cannot recall the exact dishes we ordered and some of the details.  One thing I remember is the food was delicious from the first bite to the last.  This is by far the best tasting and best value Winterlicious dinner I have had.  Ever.

My BF and I patronized Ufficio during Winterlicious 2017.  Our table was available at the reserved time, which was a delight considering sometimes the high business volume during Winterlicious could make table planning tricky.  We picked different first, main and dessert courses.  I chose a pasta as main course.  The pasta sauce blew my mind.  It was a white sauce that seemed to use butter as part of the base. The sauce was very light in texture, yet it was saturated with flavours.  The flavour combination was unexpected and unconventional.   The chef definitely took risks when designing the sauce.  My BF ordered a white sea bass as main course.  It was covered in a cheese sauce that somehow was also light in texture (I had no clue how the chefs pulled this off).  I don't know how it tasted, but my BF devoured the fish.  He said he liked his sea bass more than my pasta.  Personally, I would reorder my pasta dish in a heart beat.  My tiramisu dessert tasted rich, and it was delicious.  I don't remember what my BF ordered as dessert, but I recalled that he preferred my dessert over his.  

On our way out, I told my BF that I would order every dinner from Ufficio if I lived downtown and if I could afford it.  What is the point of me cooking, when they could cook food this heavenly delicious and innovative.  Let's leave the work to the true professionals."}
{"text":"Summerlicious means trying new restaurants, and Ufficio had been on my list of places to sample, so it was really a no-brainer.

Though all three starters sounded delicious, I elected to kick the meal off with the Insalata di Panzanella (Ontario tomatoes & bread salad with onions, basil). This was a very tasty and very simple little salad. The ingredients were all top-notch and it was a pretty delicious way to start the meal.

For my main, I went with the  Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe ( house-made spaghetti chitarra with black pepper, pecorino romano, butter, olive oil). Though this is a fairly well-known pasta dish, I'm fairly certain that this was my first time trying it and I couldn't have been more impressed. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the creamy sauce was peppery, cheesy, and completely addictive.

Now, here's my issue. I'm a pasta twirler, so I can easily quantify exactly how much I was able to eat. The portion I received added up to four full forkfuls of pasta and a few dregs left over. Four forkfuls! Now, Summerlicious is indeed an affordable option for trying new restaurants, but it's not meant to offer just a sample of an establishment's wares. This piddling amount of food would barely have qualified as a tapas plate let alone a main course. Unacceptable, to be sure.

My dessert course was the Torta Della Nonna (crisp short crust, lemon crema pasticcera, pine nuts, dusted with espresso). No complaints whatsoever for this delicious, filling dessert.

It's a shame when restaurants deliver a half-assed performance during Summerlicious (or Winterlicious), as it's unlikely I'll ever return to Ufficio (despite the fact that everything I ate was delicious)."}
{"text":"I have to say I was a tad skeptical when I booked this reservation for my husband and I on our anniversary. Italian mixed with seafood sounded too good to be true. BUT since I was pregnant so not able to enjoy the usual steak tartare or other raw delicacies, I picked this place mainly because it had the most number of dishes on the menu I could actually eat. 

When you look at who designed the menu for this restaurant, your expectations go up a notch. And my expectations were blown out of the water. The ambiance was divine; quiet, intimate and simple, without being overly 'hipster'. The staff were extraordinary and attentive and honest. 

The food was impeccable. From the focaccia (which was ridiculous, a must get) to the mains we ordered, I wish every bite lasted longer than the one before. I know the menu changes periodically, but if you can get the leek tortelli with lobster, that is probably the best lobster dish in the city (just putting it out there). And it's not just 3 measly tortellis; it was such a decent portion I was thoroughly impressed.

A definite go-to spot for special occasions."}
{"text":"Simply amazing... what a great find, a little, trendy gem in the city. I had the crudo, followed by the sea bass and the panna cota. Everything was melt in your mouth delicious, and that's coming from someone who isn't really into seafood. Delightfully presented, wonderful service and trendy atmosphere. It's like I went to seafood heaven!"}
{"text":"food was amazing. nothing was mailed in; every bite was exciting. service was great. cocktails were very good. my only complaint was like why did they have to ding me for $6.50 for a bottle of pellegrino? we spent $100+/person and paid super inflated prices for pellegrino. might bring my own next time."}
{"text":"You definitely want to come here if you are a seafood lover and you love Italian food. Even their lasagna is made with seafood and not meat, which allows you to have normally very heavy items with a lighter twist. Prices are a little high for the portion you get for some dishes.

Appetizers
We got the Fritto Misto which is lightly battered and fried shrimp, octopus and white fish, and the Capesante, which is pan seared scallops with a creamy corn purée to start. I would recommend the scallops over Fritto Misto as the scallops were cooked to perfection, while the Fritto Misto was nothing special...kind of reminds me of Japanese tempura except Japanese tempura is better, in my opinion.

Mains
I had the Icelandic Cod and really enjoyed it - decent size, cooked to the right level but nothing special. I tried my friend's Porcini Agnolotti with added truffles and this is probably my favourite! Big pieces of truffle but probably because you are paying $9 more to add it on, pasta portion was really small. My other friend had the seafood lasagna and the portion was huge. The sauce on the lasagna was sort of like lobster bisque. We noticed the food didn't come as hot as we would like but this is probably because they don't want to over cook the seafood.

Overall great restaurant if you enjoy seafood but a bit pricey for the amount you are getting."}
{"text":"We had a great time at ufficio, the food and service was great. We tried the special pastas and octopus and they were awesome. The must have is the gamberi fritti! The food was a 5, the desert not so much. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing.  We always go to Uffucio when we have out of town guests.  It's delicious, the restaurant is beautiful, and the service is exceptional.  They had a squash salad that I keep hoping they will bring back.  Any of their seafood pastas are amazing.  There is a celery root purée on one of their dishes that would be worth the trip alone.

Lovely cocktail menu as well"}
{"text":"We went to this spot for our anniversary dinner and it was definitely cozy and romantic although a bit dark due to the lighting and ambiance. 

We got the sea bass and the gnocchi as the main courses and they were just the right amount of filling while feeling not overly stuffed. 

The affogato is refreshing as a dessert and definitely recommended. 

Overall if you are looking for good Italian seafood or vegetarian options you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the food and vibe here. 

A bunch of us went to ufficio for dinner and the first thing we all noticed was how tall all of the waitress were. They can be models. 

Of course we didn't go to ufficio to check out the waitress so on to my review about the food. We order a bunch of appies to share. They were all very tasty but the star of the show was the king oyster mushroom salad. It was so full in flavour and texture that I can eat the whole thing myself.  The second Favourite was the arancini balls, super crunchy on the outside, super moist on in the inside. As for main, all the pastas were very tasty but also very rich in butter. I can only eat a few bites before moving on to the super moist and tender cod.

Overall, great location great food, you should come try it."}
{"text":"After I posted my first review, Ufficio reached out and apologized for the experience I had. They were very gracious and asked if I would be willing to return, and considering that I enjoyed the food, I was interested in returning. 

Several weeks ago I returned with a friend, and I was excited to see how the kinks had been ironed out. My friend and I are not big on cocktails, but we do enjoy beer, so immediately we looked for the beer options on the menu. The beer menu is pretty limited, but there was one beer that interested us, so we ordered it. And I kid you not, I thought they were pulling my leg when they said they were out of the beer we chose (deja vu!) So my friend and I settled for a beer they had in stock. 

In terms of the food, we decided to get the gnocchi and their special - a whole baked fish with cherry tomatoes, peppers and herbs. It also came with a side of potatoes. 

I actually preferred the food during my first visit - the gnocchi was served in a cream sauce, not tomato, and though the fish was tasty, the bones became tedious to remove. 

Close to the end of our meal my friend asked for another beer - and guess what? They were out of it too. Apparently we got the last two. However, minutes later we were told that they actually weren't out, but they were warm. We said we were ok with that. But rather than drink warm beer, the bartender came over with two pints of cold beer to make up for the trouble - great touch! 

In sum, some of the issues continue to persist (I.e. running out of items on the menu), but rather than feel completely disappointed, I appreciate how hard they are trying to make it up to to their patrons. 

I am confident that the next time I return, they will have every item on their menu. :)"}
{"text":"Review 700!! I'm undecided to do a 4 or 4.5 star rating but either way, it solidly deserves love and another visit perhaps.

I wouldn't necessary think a dinner of this calibre would sit this far out on Dundas West but this place does exist!  I wouldnt say it's necessarily fine dining but it reminds me a lot of type of atmosphere I experienced at Grey Gardens.  Very good food, flavours are amazing, and service subtle & attentive with a really fun (and possibly) loud vibe.  We arrived a bit early because our day ran faster than anticipated... it's nice and chill when it first opens.  Around 7 pm, the music is great & loud and the room is even louder.  It's not quite your romantic spot... think of it more like a great spot for a fun date or time with friends.

Service here is always observant even if you're in the front little space... There's mainly two spaces and depending on the season, one is better than the other.  The front space is right in the bay window and lets in a lot of light... perfect for brunch and summer but chilly for winter.  In the back, it has the larger dining space and the sound just banks off the exposed walls.  

The menu here changes often and I think that's great.  That night it was more towards a winter menu with a new soup (zuppe).  We took a lot of the recommendations of the staff which had a really great understanding of the various tastes.  I think they recs were on point and I can eat that salad over and over again.

Insalata D'ivana King Mushroom & asparagus salad - I've had a lot of phenomenal salads and this one ranks up there.  Unconventional because it doesnt have traditional dressed leafy greens.  This is mostly composed of vinegared delicious savoury mushrooms with thinly sliced asparagus.  Then it has ribbons of creamy smooth cheesy that nicely balance the acidity and dashes of roasted hazelnut for crunch.  I can order this again easily.  5/5

Seafood Zuppe with mussels, shrimp, and fish - Our experience at Chabrol made us try this dish.  We were hoping for a really nice rich tomato flavoured soup that had a lot of seafood.  I have to admit everything was really well cooked. Crispy skin on the fish that had delicately cooked meat.  With tender shrimp & mussels sitting in the lightly spiced broth, it was a nice to sop up all the flavours with the thick cut foccoccia.  I would give Chabrol the better rating because I found this Zuppe to be less seafood for the price point.  4/5

Polpo alla Griglia Grilled Octopus - This was really delicious and so well executed.  Nicely charred and crispy exterior that easily gave way to tender meat. Love the seasoning on this too... it didn't overpower the octopus.  The addition of the beans below wasn't bad... nice soft texture but it was heavily salted.  4.5/5

Roasted Cauliflower - We just had one of the best cauliflowers in San Diego and this one is reminiscent of it.  Nicely crisped cauliflower florets that had a nice balance of tangy creamy goat cheese, sweet cooked grapes, and abundance of toasted nuttiness.  A really great side dish that can easily be elevated to part of a main.  5/5

Chocolate Budino - I was torn between this and the vanilla pavlova and the staff recommended this one.  For chocolate lovers, this is perfect for you... rich, indulgent, and creamy dark chocolate that includes pieces of nuts and vibrant cherry.  I found this to be very close to a chilled ganache.  I like chocolate but I found this one to be a bit overwhelming.  4/5

Overall, I really did like Ufficio and loved how it's a pescatarian menu that constantly changes.  With attentive service and delicious food, its one of the better ones in Toronto that I can see myself returning again to try more."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and LOVED it! My starter was the vegetable soup and that was pretty standard. It was good but nothing out of the world. However, the gnocchi was something else...so nice and soft. The dessert was also quite good. I got the polenta cake and was pleasantly surprised by the texture and it came all NICE AND WARM! I'm definitely going back to try their seafood lasagna."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the most awesome meals I've had.  Love this pescatarian restaurant that opened on Toronto's west end.  Five star because it is simply delicious, courteous and friendly staff and plating is on point.  

Tradition is that if we did a Winterlicious menu we would also order something off the regular menu and this time we decided on the GAMBERI FRITTI, squid ink battered lightly fried, B.C. striped prawns with spicy aioli.  I'm still thinking about this!  It was so fluffy and had that sweet freshness of a juicy shrimp!  In all honesty if you haven't tried their Rosemary and garlic focaccia just start there!

Appetizers were:
INSALATA di CAVOLETTI DI BRUXELLES
Shaved Brussels sprouts, russet apple, lightly fried smoked mackerel, roman anchovy dressing.  I quite enjoyed this as it was refreshing and I never thought I would enjoy mackerel but wowza!
...and
TROUT CRUDO
Ontario trout conserva with horseradish yogurt, fennel, dill and pickled chilli.  Nicely done, another light fare that boasted radical flavours.

The Main:
PESCE
Pan seared Arctic char, celeriac puree, lentil ragu, crème fraiche.  The plate for this was 100% on point--it looked like is was presented right on the ocean.  So pretty!
...and
SPAGHETTI PUTTANESCA CON GAMBERI AND CALAMARI
with anchovies, garlic, tomatoes, calamari & shrimp.  So much flavour and so much love!  I wished they had the seafood lasagna (that was posted on the original Winterlicious menu thought).

And finally dessert:
Polenta cake (vegetarian)
Polenta cake with a fig, pistachio compote.  I enjoyed this.  Light and fluffy and not too sweet.
...and
SORBET blood orange flavour.  Very refreshing and yummy but nothing that stood out.


All and all easily one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and deliciously fulfilling for the tummy!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice, it felt like everyone knew the owners except for our table.  We went on a Wednesday thinking there were oyster specials but we were told it ended however our reservation email said the opposite.  After having to explain to the owner or manager we got the $1 oyster.  

Every dish was so salty and the portion size was extremely small for the price you pay.  I can understand if the quality was good but the salt over powered everything.  If the kitchen tasted the food, they would not of served it.

Bill came oyster was not $1, having to explain again got the deal.

There's a lot of choices in the area, definitely don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"while ufficio is still working out little kinks here and there, operating in a tight space, its downs are really a reflection how big its ups really are. 

firstly, bar service here is fantastic, with the guys tending the bar displaying a warm personality, eager to concoct drinks for me on a whim and while my tastes are simple, those vying for inventive and boozy cocktails need look no further. 

the food is on par with any of my other fave places, burrata and bread are stunning, the octopus, so tender and well done that a friend who remains anti-seafood revels in its texture, crudo's and raw plates have all been stand-out's. its a smaller space offering an intimate setting, with fantastic decore and truly exceeded my very high expectations for great food. ive been twice and look forward to returning. 

great place for a date or to start off a big west-side night."}
{"text":"A new year brings a new menu and chef to Toronto's Italian pescatarian restaurant, Ufficio. Chef, Francesco Venditti, formerly head chef of Jamie's Italian Kitchen and Bar Buca, brings his vast experience to Ufficio by creating new and flavourful dishes that cross the line between traditional and non-traditional. Venditti says \"Adding cheese to fish brings the dish to a new level. For example having mackerel with stracciatella is not something you'll see on other Italian menus but it will be a taste you will want to have over and over again.\" His permissive approach allows for a vibrant and unique menu full of dishes that will have you coming back for more.

The most notable dishes on the new menu are the sustainably-sourced fish and seafood crudo as well as the grilled octopus with risotto nero and crispy calvo nero. There is also an interesting Sicilian style arancini filled with octopus bolognese and buffalo boccincini served on top of warm bagna càuda.

Johnathan at Ufficio was extremely knowledgeable in every dish on the menu. His expertise and recommendations guided us on our dining journey making it quite the memorable experience! Here's what we had: 

Crudo Del Giorno - P/A

Rosemary & Garlic Focaccia - $3 

Gamberi Fritti - Squid Ink Battered BC Striped Prawns with Spicy Aioli - $16 

Arugula Fettucine - King Crab & BC Striped Prawns - $33 

Zuppa Di Pesce All'Abruzzese - BC Clams, Mussels, Prawns, Trout, Tomato Brodo - $29 

Brussels Sprouts (Market Vegetables) 

Panna Cotta 

I don't think any one dish stood out from the rest. All were equally very light and tasty. I think the main allure of the dishes at Ufficio is that they are Italian-inspired yet LIGHT. There are no heavy sauces and cheese as one would experience at a typical Italian restaurant. Instead, sauces are kept light and simple, garnishes are fresh, batter is light, ingredients are local and none of the flavours are overpowering. Creating food so simply delicious is the real task at hand and I applaud Venditti for doing such an impeccable job."}

I do like the menu choices ($38) with 4 different to choice from for Appetizer/Main/Dessert and it would be great to come and enjoy with a vegetarian. 

Gorgeous colours and wonderful plating! The ingredients all fresh and in season. I love all the dish I choose and they were delicious!

What impressed me the most is how good their vegetable sides! Usually the afterthought in most restaurant, but here they are as good as the protein! I kind of thinking maybe, just maybe I should have pick the other Mains which are vegetarian!

Overall it is a 4 star experience for food!

Sadly though the service was lacking. Our Bohemian vibe waitress was not presence both physically and mentally. The wait between dish was long and painful, but I kind of expect during Licious time."}
{"text":"Table wasn't ready when we arrived but we went next door for a drink. Some people might be put off by an extra 30 min wait for a table but for me - if the food is worth it - the wait is no problem at all!

Great wines - we had two bottles of red. Focaccia and burrata were delicious. I liked the pistachio in the burrata. The plate of peppers with sauce to start is highly recommended!

The oysters as a starter were pretty good but on the smaller side. The mains were where they really upped their game. The grilled octopus dish is unbelievable. I want to know how they get it so tender! The rapini was superb as well. 

I would def like to go back here. The menu is interesting and creative. Flavours and ingredients were top notch.  I like the focus on seafood. This place is on my list for favourites in the Dundas and ossington area. Comparing it to Omaw (where we went last week) puts it head and shoulders above."}
{"text":"I visited Ufficio last night for Summerlicious with a friend and I must say they went above and beyond service wise. Note: I called and left a message saying I am Celiac (gluten free) and a staff member Stacy called me back and said they would be picking up some gluten free pasta to have on hand when I visit. I tried the Pesce Spada, the vegetarian style pasta with the gluten free noodle (which I bet was just as amazing as the gnocchi except mine wasn't fritti style), and the Affogato minus the ladyfingers. My friend tried the Arancini, Branzino and Torta Della Nonna. We both loved our meals, and no cross-contamination on my end either! Thank you very much to the incredible and friendly team at Ufficio. They greeted us warmly on the way in and thanked us on the way out. It might be a small venue but I highly recommend this restaurant for a date night with a friend or significant other."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious lunch and really enjoyed it. Only complaint was that the food came out just a bit slow. 

I got the arancini for my appetizer - it was a good portion.. two good sized fried balls of ricey goodness. Perfectly crunchy on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside. For my main, I got agnolotti which was super tasty!! Dessert was affogato.. also really good. My friend got the polenta cake which came warm and was crispy on the outside.. super yums!! All this was def worth the $28!"}
{"text":"Meals here are amazing! Everything I had was very well done, especially, I loved the Brutta cheese with an airly toast, Brussels Sprouts grilled with juicy (balsamic, I think) sauce and served with walnuts, and a Whole Fish that was great for sharing with a group.

Drinks, on the other hand, were all okay. I ordered a $48 sauvignon blanc from Chile, which turned out to be what I buy from LCBO for $12. We also ordered multiple cocktails, but nothing notable.

Service was overall okay as well. The server's suggestion on portion was helpful. Otherwise, one of the glasses had a chip; our server didn't come check in with our table much. As the evening got darker, they dimmed the lights a lot, to the point the old couple next to us both had to use cellphone lights to read the menu. It was pretty noticeable, but no staff changed the lighting.

It's worth going back for food though. I will probably have drinks somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very nice decor ( love the couch in the front of the restaurant). 
We had the Summerlicious menu. The food was ok, but nothing spectacular. The server at bar was really nice as well."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious last night and ordered the Swordfish crudo, Octopus and Polenta cake. It was delicious, albeit portions were tiny. 

The main problem here is the service. I'm giving this place three stars despite the delicious food because our server had her heads in the clouds the entire time. She was not even the slightest bit friendly, quite forgetful to fill our water glasses, and only cared about flirting with the bartender (not gonna lie, he was cute). She never offered anything more than what was asked of her. 

Sadly, unless the servers learn some people skills I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Ufficio is located near Dundas St. W and Ossington. The small restaurant sits around 30-40 and  is beautifully decorated. I came by for brunch with a friend on Sunday around 11:30am and the place was not full. We were able to sit near the entrance which was great. Throughout our time there, the place was rarely busy which made for a comfortable and relaxing environment.

For brunch, my friend and I shared the toast all'avocado and the salmone affumicato. Both were delicious and served with salad. We finished the dishes and wanted more. Highlights were the avocado toast as the bread was homemade focaccia which added a nice flavour to the overall dish. 

Service was attentive and friendly, we did not feel rushed to leave at any point. Would love to try their dinner menu sometime!"}
