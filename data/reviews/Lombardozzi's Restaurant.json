{"text":"I was shocked by how poor the food quality and service was in this restaurant. It looks like a bar with tables and my server had on black biking spandex and a sweatshirt. Not exactly 'Fine Dining' like the sign on the window claims and certainly not by the overpriced menu. The drinks took forever, I had something floating in my wine. The soup tasted spoiled, the tomatoes in my salad were frozen and mushy. We ordered bruschetta and got three pieces of arranged white loaf bread with a couple tomatoes and olive oil drizzled down the center.  The restroom sink had black hair all through it, the toilet wasn't anchored down!  This place is TRASHY. Complete nightmare. Total dive bar with awful food and service. The server had to be reminded numerous times to bring our check to us, kept roaming away. Neither of us touched our dinner, we were afraid to eat it. Diners beware, spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Dreamy zucchini, Clams Maison fabulous taste but too damp and need more minced clams, standard salad delightful, fresh, crisp, and big, house-made blue cheese dressing fresh and good, sheet pasta for ravioli and lasagna to die for- thin and tasty- kept pasta from being heavy, marinara and vodka sauces tangy and fresh tasting. A winner. We'll be back! And server Deb was a treat."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.  Family owned homemade itAlian food. They way it's suppose to be. Will go again when I'm in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I recently had a semi-large event at Lombardozzi's. They were very accommodating and easy to work with. Staff was super friendly and helpful. You may need to give them some reminder regarding your event, when you want to eat, and keep track of your payment. Food was pretty good--the baked chicken melted right off the bone--that good. I would definitely recommend them to host your affordable banquet dinner--you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for two glasses of wine. When they came they were filthy to the point where they were covered in lipstick. I'll never try the food here."}
{"text":"This review is for their banquet room and not for their regular menu. I came here for a communion party and what a place to hold such an occasion. There is definitely a family feel here.   Food was served buffet style, but there were servers to place the food on our plates, which I thought was very nice. Taste-wise, the food was delicious. On the menu was baked chicken, penne pasta, meatballs, fried zucchini, potato balls, salad and bread. Chicken was moist and well-seasoned. Meatballs were also moist and flavorful. My favorites were the fried zucchini and potato balls. The potato balls were pieces of potato, breaded and fried. They were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I'm definitely curious as to how the regular menu is and definitely plan on coming back!  Service was also great. The servers served our food from the buffet trays and they also cleared our empty plates out of our way quickly. The reason for my docking of one star is that it was so dark in there! The restaurant's outdated brown decor didn't brighten anything up either. I suppose it makes the place feel like you're over nana's house or something, but the darkness made it feel a little depressing."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dead.  Couldn't serve their breaded clams cause they didn't make the stuffing that day.  Service was very slow.  Food was ok.  Pasta was mushy.  Bread was not fresh.  Used to have a crispy Italian bread from Sancholis.  Not the same Italian restaurant we used to love."}
{"text":"Attended a party for my celebrating my cousin's college graduation. The private room is a wonderful place to celebrate and have fun with family and friends. The food, I always enjoy. Very tasty and filling, great service as well."}
{"text":"Best Italian comfort food buffet in Pittsburgh. The real deal. Looks like a location for a Martin Scorsese movie.  They have regular menu-order items but I only go for lunch to have the buffet with its somewhat revolving dishes . The meat-balls are amazing. Chicken parm/marsala pure oral delight .   Try it, if you haven't .  *note - they raised the lunch buffet price to $11 as of January, 2016 .*"}
{"text":"i don't really remember the food but i definitely remember the mice (yes 2) i saw in the dining room! it was very awkward considering it was a first date. service was polite and nice but i never went back because of the above issue. this was about a year ago today, so i guess i should have rated then but just saw it on my yelp list."}
{"text":"I came here awhile back, wanting to sample some of the Italian restaurants in Bloomfield.  I came on a weeknight around 7pm, and it wasn't crowded at all.  I ordered the gnocchi.  It was okay, and not a bad meal, but it didn't wow me--it wasn't really anything out of the ordinary.  On the plus side, my waitress was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was nice for a date.  Overall, an okay option for Italian, but I doubt I'll be back anytime soon, since there's better to be had elsewhere in PGH."}
{"text":"I pulled into this unassuming restaurant for lunch.    The place is old school.   I feel as if I am in a Good Fella's movie.     There aer 2 standup gambling syle video game machines (think space invaders but they are are called \"Magical Odds and the other one is not named but has is a memory game.  The place is very friendly.      I ordered the wedding soup and the Spinach Gnocchi with a Crown and Diet Coke- I needed a drink after driving the hot wheels track known as Downtown Pittsburgh - I think my GPS needed a drink too ;-)...  My wedding soup arrived and I felt it was a littel under seasoned but that is something I can definitely add - no dings here.  The Gnocchi arrived and it was quite tasty.     The pasta was done right - I had felt like I was eating spinach dumplings.    I orignally was going to request a meat but this meal needed none of that nonsense.  They have a lunchtime buffet that looked good but I wanted to try something made fresh for my first stop.  Overall - I like this place  Service - Great - super friendly Food - Very good - The Gnocch and their other homade pastas deserve a try Price - My meal (dinner menu) was $17.  Check this place out - it will definitely take you back to the 70's :-)"}
{"text":"No idea how this place is still in business.  Dad and I came in on a Thursday night.  Our waiter was the cook, bartender, and host.  For two hours, this place was deserted except for us.  A touch suspicious.  I ordered a gnocchi dinner with lobster and crab in Alfredo sauce ($22.95).  There was a plethora of seafood in this dish, although it was not the best gnocchi I have ever eaten.  The Alfredo sauce was also a bit too garlicy because it lacked any other flavoring.  The entree was not bad, but it wasn't the greatest Italian food either.  The fresh bread was good.  However, I was really unimpressed with the salad.  The dressing was overly strong, and there was far too much of it.  Just an ok meal.  In the future, I will definitely go to the Pleasure Bar over Lombardozzi's.  The food is cheaper and the quality of the Italian food is better."}
{"text":"We ate here after my dad was released from West Penn Hospital for heart issues. So we celebrated with heart healthy olive oil based food haha.  Lombardozzi's is not only fun to say but a good place to eat. Friendly good service. Little antipasto appetizers set out while you decide from the menu. Top notch place."}
{"text":"Lombardozzi's is an average Italian restaurant. The food is OK and the service isn't great. This restaurant is not one that I will frequently revisit."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! Oh, where should I start..? My family and friends came here for a Sunday lunch. The prices are crazy high (for -cheap- pasta). The menu outside the building and website doesn't match what they show you at the table. One of our guest was the last one to receive his perfectly square cheese ravioli and the filling was still frozen! (You'd think that for a $16 ravioli plate you'd get home made). After they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat. Some had flavorless Chicken Piccata, Fish and Eggplant Parmigiana. The atmosphere didn't help. The only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce.  I don't understand the big fuzz some make about this restaurant. What a joke!"}
{"text":"I agree with Darren's review. We came here with one of his friends from high school who is from Bloomfield not long ago. My Ginger Salmon was ok and not a whole lot more. They grill it and serve it on top of a shrimp risotto. It sounds better than it was. They also overdress their salads, and the service is choppy but friendly. I liked the decor myself. Overall, it is a very average restaurant from my POV."}
{"text":"Family friendly! While some reviewers may lament the outdated interiors, a feature that was not missed by me, I will merely say that Lombardozzi proved to be the best venue for our toddler that we have come upon in months. Our server did not know the difference between bolognese and meat sauce, but she brought soup and milk for our toddler faster than you can say pronto! She fawned over our daughter and made us feel comfortable.   Additionally, the owner and chef both came to our table to talk to us. My husband and I felt like we were eating at a friend's house, and that warmth is a hell of a lot sexier than any atmosphere we've gotten in a swanky Shadyside lounge.   We ordered simple pasta dishes: linguine and meat sauce, and spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was fresh and al dente; the garnishes were tasteful and classic; the sauces were remarkable.   I recommend this place for the food and congenial service. It would easily get 5 stars if we hadn't sat in the outdated bar."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for almost 3 decades (my entire being). This restaurant has a place in my heart and many members of my family. Being that I was raised in an Italian culture, I have much appreciation for the taste and quality of their food.    Today we had a small banquet, of about 30 people, for lunch to celebrate a mile stone. We arrived early, but were very much welcomed and the back room was all set up for us already. The server was very friendly, welcoming and ready for our group.     The room set up was put together very nicely. The tables were set up in a long/3 sided way so that we were all together at \"one\" table. I liked that very much.     We picked a buffet style lunch. The chicken was a fried chicken that was not dry and had a good amount of meat. The penne with marinara was so good. I love their sauce! The meatballs are home made and seasoned very well, smothered in their marinara sauce. We also had their fried zucchini and these amazing fried potato balls! I'm telling you, these potato things are awesome! I didn't know they were going to be served, but I'm so happy they were!     The cost of the banquet, service, and setting were very much affordable! I am very happy with everything and am looking forward to another visit.      P.S. This is a perfect place for a nice Italian dinner for two. They are family owned and have been around since the 70's. They know what they are doing here."}
{"text":"I have been here only for the lunch buffet, thus can speak only about it. I wish I had more opportunity to dine here and regret that it is offered only Mondays through Fridays. I love it!  For the low price of $8.95, one has a choice of several delicious dishes, soup, and cake.  There is a small salad bar which includes cole slaw, salad mix, a salad with small pieces of fresh broccoli and cauliflower, and sometimes potato salad.  There is always fried zucchini (one of the best I have had), a pasta dish (most recently, it was thin pasta noodles in a garlic sauce with small pieces of fresh broccoli), meatballs, chicken picaata with fresh mushrooms, chicken drumsticks, and fish.  I suppose the decor is dated, but it suits me just fine.  The restaurant is attractive and comfortable.  The service is generally excellent although there appears is a high staff turnover.  I do not often have the same waitress twice.  The owner is often present during lunch, which is the mark of a fine restaurant.  The place is never crowded, and it is a shame because the lunch buffet is something wonderful!"}
{"text":"Kay and I took a friend and Bloomfield native to Lombardozzi for dinner Friday evening. I specifically came to Lombardozzi since it was one of those restaurants that had been nagging me; I hadn't been to Lombardozzi since I joined Yelp 3.5 years ago, my last visit occurring sometime in 2002, I believe.   Now, I found nothing \"unappealing\" about the interiors as another reviewer put it. It is classy and old-fashioned like many a neighborhood restaurant, which puts it in the same realm as nearby Del's. Traditional, modest, and eternal are words that come to mind regarding Lombardozzi. A jolly family banquet was afoot in the room next to us, and we didn't mind in the least as we caught up with one another, carrying on with our lively conversation as the clan behind us did. Thus, we found that the atmosphere was highly welcoming.   Overall, Lombardozzi swayed wildly between a 3 and a 4 and stopped somewhere in between for me.   For starters, service was somewhat spotty. We had 3 different servers ask us for our orders. Even the third and final server admitted that he was mildly annoyed with the lack of communication.   Why I ordered Crabmeat Imperial, I can't tell you. I really didn't know what else I wanted and figured its high price ($25!) would lead me towards seafood euphoria, and it mostly did. Crabmeat and stuffing filled a trio of oyster shells with thick, sweet, meaty succulence, but damn it if the portion was stingy! It was so miserly, I was jealous of what my dining companions ordered for their entrees were not only cheaper, their rations were far more generous!  The opening salad suffered from being overdressed with a vinaigrette that I would have liked had my greens not been swimming in it.   My last course, on the other hand, was a winning chalice of Bananas Foster, which I only ordered since the restaurant was out of most of their other desserts for the evening. A rite of cinnamon, caramel, vanilla ice cream, whipped topping, and of course, bananas, I was reminded of why BF is the most ornate of all sundaes. Warmth dandled with cold. Salt and spice embraced sugar and cream. Chunks of hot, pappy starch mingled with everything. Elegance, simple, elegance.   Did I merely order poorly? You tell me. I REALLY wanted to like Lombardozzi more than I did. Something's telling me that a return visit and a plate of meatball-studded gnocchi will yield better results."}
{"text":"Well, as stated in the previous review of their lunch buffet, we finally went for dinner, and were horribly disappointed to discover a night-and-day comparison between the lunch and dinner. I had gnocchi, she had Veal Imperial, and we ordered 'traditional style' which meant for an addition $4 it came with marinated mushrooms, Clams Casino, soup and salad. My friend left 1/3 of her veal dish on her plate and didn't want to take it home. I took a bite, and my tongue experienced absolutely no flavor, to the extent that I had to take a sip of my iced tea to see if I was getting a cold and losing my sense of taste. I could taste the tea. I could taste absolutely NOTHING from her veal.  With the gnocchi, I ordered the sausage, which was again $3 extra, and when it arrived it was a flat sausage patty cut in half, that tasted like a dry sausage McMuffin patty. The salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies. The wedding soup had two tiny meatballs and about 1/3 cup of celery. The meal in general was a total disaster, but we ordered dessert anyway, and the tiramisu was still partially frozen. Then the bill came to over $82.    We could not believe that we'd enjoyed the lunch buffet so completely, which was only $7.95, and that this dinner, as overpriced as it already was, was so completely void of flavor and character.   It's baffling to comprehend that an Italian restaurant that's been around as long as they have would still survive with these prices and total lack of quality for dinner. We had gone in with such high hopes.  But honestly, for dinner, it was such a huge let-down, we'll never go back. We'll go to the lunch buffet, but never to dinner. It was truly, truly just plain sad."}
{"text":"I moved to Bloomfield in April and being Italian and loving Italian food I thought that Little Italy would be a good fit, I was wrong... Until tonight.  I have found that every Italian restaurant I've tried has left much to be desired; from Del's atrocious food to the over hyped Pleasure Bar, I had not found an Italian joint I liked.  Lombardozzi, I have not clue why I had not tried you until tonight.  I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them, but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal.  We started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection, and no rubbery feel, which is a positive, because 99% of places outside the east coast can't to calamari to save their lives.  I had the gnocchi with red sauce (only sauce option which kind of irks me, because gnocchi is great with a pesto) with meatballs.  The gnocchi is homemade and to die for, and the sauce is pretty good too (I'm a sauce snob, nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers) and the meatballs were as good as I remembered.  Great food experience, but the service was at best bad.  The waitress took over five minutes to get our drink order, and just kind of seemed annoyed at the whole working thing.  I will be back, because there is no Italian food in Bloomfield that even comes close to Lombardozzi."}
{"text":"Although there are tons of dining options in the area I find myself going to this place time and time again. This is old school italian in the best way possible. From the decor to the pasta, eating here reminds me of visiting my italian grandparents.They do seafood really well and I like the soup and salad that comes dish. Other pros are- reasonable prices for wine, you can actually have a conversation here. Service is always great."}
{"text":"Meh, if I'm feeling generous I'd give it another 1/2 star for the Italian wedding soup but my gnocchi and veal marsala were only worthy of a review to keep the exuberant reviews from getting out of hand.  I suppose I was expecting more out of Bloomfield, I would expect this service and quality outside of Little Italy.  I'd eat there again but it doesn't make me want to go back without trying other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I live just about a five minute walk from here and had never been. I wanted to go because it always reminded me of the places I'd go with my Nana when she wasn't busy cooking up her own homemade Italian delights. The food here was really good though the marinara sauce was a tad watery. Wedding soup was full of flavor. Unlimited bread that always is a winner with me. The service is really good too. Clearly their business is now parties, banquets, etc but you still get the feeling of how it once was there: Crowded, white glove, high end Italian dining in the days of old. I liked it and I will return."}
{"text":"Lombardozzi's is a wonderful Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh's Little Italy, Bloomfield.  It is conveniently located right across the street from West Penn Hospital.  I eat here every time I come to Pittsburgh, and I am never disappointed with the service or the food.  The menu is extensive and authentic Italian \"just like Grandma used to make\".  Raviolis?  Fresh.  Sauce?  Homemade.  Meatballs?  Melt in your mouth.    The one problem that I have with Lombardozzi's is the parking situation in the neighborhood.  It is impossible to get a parking space around here, even if they have their own parking lot.  The best luck that I've had with parking is a block away in the lot next to Immaculate Conception Church.    Other than the parking problem, I would highly recommend Lombardozzi's for an authentic, reasonably price Italian meal in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"There has been a pile of vomit on there sidewalk for 10 days, For the life of me I cannot believe they havent taken care of this, such a turn off.  Today is 10/3"}
