{"text":"I work downtown and was in the mood for breakfast and found Portion. The name is deceiving because when I think of \"portions\" I think of healthy eating in tiny portions. I was pleasantly surprised to pay a little bit of money for A TON of food. I couldn't even finish! I grabbed it to go and they cooked it so fast. I had the CLE breakfast. Every bite was different and so good.  The potatoes were awesome, the flagel (fried bagel) was amazing. This is my new favorite spot and I can't wait to try their lunch"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place one star is because it is not an option to give a zero. We walked into Portion to get a breakfast to go. We ordered the \"big breakfast\" which is 3 eggs, toast, sausage and hash-browns. There was only 2 other customers inside at this time. We sat for about 40 minutes waiting for our food. When an order came out we realized that there was still another customer ahead of us waiting for his food and the chef had not even started preparing it yet.   The \"restaurant\" is open so you can see the \"chef\" behind the counter preparing your food. While he was moving around the kitchen his eyes were closing and he was swaying side to side. The guy at the counter could tell I was visibly frustrated waiting now 50 minutes for a \"to-go\" breakfast. I honestly contemplated asking him if I could go behind the counter and lend a hand. I am really baffled at what could take this long to prepare scrambled eggs and sausage considering that none of these ingredients take even close to 50 minutes to prepare.  After an hour the guy at the counter came over and gave us a complimentary cup of coffee for our wait and finally brought the person before us his food. He assured us it would be out shortly. It took about another 10 minutes for the chef to finish our meal. The guy at the counter even had the nerve to offer us a 10% discount the next time we came in. I was insulted by this to be honest. I felt the entire meal should have been completely refunded. Let me be clear- there will never be a next time and I would not offer that coupon to my worst enemy.   When we finally got our food it was a below average meal. The sausage was not even edible. The eggs and toast was fine but I truly could have eaten anywhere else in a quarter of the time for the same price. I am baffled at how awful this entire experience was. I have truly never had a worse experience at an eating establishment in my entire life."}
{"text":"Not much to the inside but wow what a breakfast, and they serve it all day.  I had the CLE breakfast for $8.00 and it's had to take half of it to go.   Comes with a deep fried bagel which is killer.  Real clean including the bathrooms"}
{"text":"Guy had our delicious party melt. Was very happy with the texture and the build. Said he will be back to try out the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"New casual breakfast/sandwich spot that opened up downtown in the old Mirch Masala location. The makeshift \"Portion\" signage, carelessly draped so the \"M\" from \"Mirch\" was still visible, did not inspire much confidence as I walked through the door.  The menu is divided into \"hot\" and \"cold\" options. I ordered the chicken club from the \"cold\" side. Advertising themselves as a fast casual option, I was disappointed to wait 20 minutes for what amounted to cold pieces of chicken, tomato, lettuce and bacon in-between two pieces of bread. Given they are newly opened, mentally I gave them a pass and kept an open mind.  The sandwich did not look particularly appetizing once I was finally served. I have made better at home. It was small, unexciting and boring. At $8, this was definitely overpriced. I left hungry, dissatisfied and angry at myself for not stopping at Chipotle instead.   The only redeeming quality of Portion was that it replaced Mirch Masala, a terrible Indian restaurant that was a disgrace to my south asian heritage."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, a nice variety of options at good prices, and friendly staff. Nice to have a good new local option by Public Square."}
{"text":"Stopped by Portion for lunch with my co-worker. The place has been updated since it was Mirch Masala just a few months ago. We perused the menu and we both independently selected the chicken salad wrap, cuz how could you go wrong with that?  You order ahead of time at a register, pay, and then seat yourself and wait for your food. If you pay with debit/credit card, you have to tip in advance. If you have cash, you can tip after. They have free refills on drinks.  The cashier delivered our food to our table and offered refills. The wraps looked good and so did the french fries that my co-worker ordered. I opted for jalapeno potato chips, which were very tasty. The wraps were served with a slice of tasty dill pickle.  Both of us found the chicken salad wraps to be bland. They had a good portion of chicken in them and they had the right amount of dressing, but they could have used some pecans, walnuts, grapes, onions, celery...ya know, flavor!  The lettuce gave it a good crunch. The quality was very good. I wouldn't order it again unless they kicked it up a notch.  I might stop back, but I might not."}
