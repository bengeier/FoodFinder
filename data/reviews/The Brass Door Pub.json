{"text":"The servers are so nice but most of all the bathrooms are literally LUXURIOUS. 5 stars fantastic music(~:"}
{"text":"This place is great. The bar tenders are friendly, the new menu is awesome and delicious, and the entertainment and music is just perfect. They have a nice terrasse and the best part is: it's affordable!"}
{"text":"first visit to this bar / pub on upper Crescent ~ here's the skinny  Atmosphere: extremely cozy, warm, and welcoming.  This is where you want to be when you meeting your friends for a drink - it's casual and not assuming.  This is not a pretentious place by any stretch of the imagination.  The place even offers a live band on certain days, surefire way to pass an eventful evening  Food: was not able to try the food given that we arrive too late in the evening but based on the menu it looks like it's regular pub fare & the prices are quite reasonable  Service:  Being not so busy, there is one waitress and one bartender.  Service is good, but not spectacular it's almost nonchalant."}
{"text":"Great place to go have a quiet beer with friends, not as loud or crowded as many bars downtown. Great service. AND 25 cent wings on Wednesdays which are great, love the honey garlic! They do really great fish and chips. Also has screens to watch Hockey games."}
{"text":"Staying at Le Meridien Versailles. .came across this pub after just a few minutes walking around the hotel.  As it was about 7p and didn't see anyone in the pub from the street, wasn't sure if they were opened..took a gamble with the door and to our liking, they were!  Prices were extremely good (Ontario and BC could take some advise here) and had Guinness on tap and my folks glasses of chardonnay.   Food: lots of starters which we shared..12 salt and pepper wings, beer battered mushrooms with very tasty ginger sweet and sour, 2 orders of Poutine, and pizza rolls..all very tasty and all reasonably priced.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love Sahara. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck the bartenders though. I found glass in my drink and I showed them and they didn't even give me a new one.... normal"}
{"text":"Stopped in before we had to head to the airport. Didn't know anything about it but dropped in when one of the wait staff recommended the food. He even said to try the roast beef sandwich, which we did. The menu even proclaimed \"you'll never ask Where's the beef?\". We ordered 4 with fries. When they came they were the saddest looking sandwiches ever. They each had one small slice of roast beef, with one having a hair in it (pretty gross - which was sent back). When the waitress asked how we liked the sandwiches I mentioned that they were pretty sad - even quoting the menu. She stammered some excuses and never tried to fix the issue. I suppose if you've had enough to drink then you might not care about the sorry state of this food. stay away - you've been warned. Unfortunately I can't give a review less than 1. I'll be looking forward to whatever replaces them next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Good vibes! Thursday night (around 10/10:15p) they have live music. I don't remember the band or lead singer's name but they weren't so diverse with the songs they covered. But I loved it! Waitresses are friendly (didn't expect anything less). They're drink options aren't too vast but I'm sure they have something for you. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since last fall 2016, and immediately fell in love with Soulvation Thursdays. The brass door is a fairly traditional pub- their food menu is $$ Nachos, burgers aren't bad with a decent bar selection of drinks.   I go on and off go catch a performance by Shaharah and Soulvation - it's hard to find live band performances that will do old school R&B covers to Lauryn Hill, Montell Jordan, Next, etc. The vibe gets nuts! I love the energy in this place during their performances - everyone is dancing, smiling, singing and just jiving to old tracks - don't be surprised if you need to bring along a towel with the amount of sweat you need to wipe off from dancing!  The  bad performs 2 sets - the show ends around 12:30 am - full house, come early if you want seats ~8:30 pm!  Be warned the lady's toilet doesn't work too well and will require like flushing a million times - no sarcasm here - best so do your business anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"Just happened to waltz in here as a non-Montréal native on a Thursday, and was not disappointed by any means. We were pleasantly surprised by some incredible live music and had a ton of fun. Extremely affordable, the crispy fries are to die for, and the staff is incredibly friendly (Kalena - I believe was our waitress's name - was absolutely wonderful). Would highly recommend as my late-night Thursday bar of choice."}
{"text":"we took a lunch break from Beaux Arts museum headed for a restaurant a person there had recommended, but it was closed. So, shot in the dark from several places on Crescent we went here...empty at just after 12:30,,,,my first thought was , uh-oh. However, it turned out very well...the bartender/server Cody was efficient, helpful and full of fun. Companion had fish/chips which she thought was vey good, I had smoked turkey sandwich on a very good bun and sweet potato fries. Classic rock from 70's was enjoyable. Looks like lots of beer selections, outside patio, and yeh, several people wandered in while we were there. Would definitely go back! happy trails"}
{"text":"I was a meetup gathering. We were supposed to go to the maison cloakroom but unfortunately they could not accommodate our number (we were 12). Instead we shifted to the brass door pub. I did not know this place before. The moment you step into the place you smell the draft beer, which confirms you are in an Irish pub, which is one of my favourites.  I went there and ordered some kind of cocktail, it was really nice, I had the hot sauce chicken wings (typical) and the cheese sticks. Both were really good. Service is good too. The place is nice and the group I was with was nice. I had really a good time with this simplistic yet adorable pub. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Great place to stop after the museum and grab a drink and some food. Bar tender was super friendly! Very happy we stopped here!"}
{"text":"Landed at Brass Door with some of my favorite Yelpers after a local shindig. We sat at the bar and we're graciously served by Dan himself. He was approachable but didn't crowd, informative without being pushy, and introduced us to a \"Jameson break\" in the form of Forty Creek. If ever I were to send someone here, I would hope they would be served by him. Menu wasn't anything great, the jalapeño caps weren't what I was expecting despite them being good for what they were. A few sub par wing sauces but that depends on your palette. Poutine sauce was sub par however. All in all, between pricing specials, vibe and great staff I would definitely suggest this hidden gem if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Just found this jewel on a trip to Montreal. The bar is very cozy, and I lucked out to be there during an open-mike night! Very decent local talent."}
{"text":"This bar is alright. I like the fact this bar has Sapporo pitchers. I never see Sapporo pitchers in montreal that much."}
{"text":"Interesting beers, letter than average pouting and surprisingly good salads."}
