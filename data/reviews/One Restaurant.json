{"text":"Very nice restaurant and excellent service.  We started with the lobster spoons (awesome) and then had the miso black cod and the short ribs for dinner.  The black cod was outstanding but the short ribs were just average.  For a lighter dessert, try the buttermilk pan a cotta.  Nice presentation and very good without making you feel stuffed."}

{"text":"I have had occasion to eat here a few times, various meals, as well as many meals through room service at the hotel (I love the hotel,  by the way). I have to say,  is this all spme kind of joke?  This restaurant is unabashedly terrible,  easily one of the poorest I have experienced - and such hype! Run away as quickly as you can. Bad flavour, laxy preparation and a sense of self-importance.  I've eaten at the finest restaurants in the world,  and this one is not in the conversion. Not remotely."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant with my friend last week, was impressed by the beautiful patio section. Lots of people were dinning there, and it was absolutely a very nice view of the yorkville. Enjoyed the atmosphere very much!   The food and drink were also very good, very nice presentation and very delightful, very good experience overall.   Will try again for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had ordered the lobster pasta and lobster spoons and will be coming back! The only thing that turned me off was how shitty the server was treating the new kid who was working there."}
{"text":"We went for brunch - sat on the patio and people-watched.  It was definitely relaxing and the food was really good, although probably a little bit overpriced.  We had eggs-benedict, lemon ricotta pancakes, a beer and a bellini - $65. The service was good but I expected a little bit more."}
{"text":"Food 4.5/5 Atmosphere 5/5 Service 3/5  I most recently came for the summerlicious menu ($45 excluding tips and tax) with a group of 18 people.   Food:  App - tuna tacos. The flavor was great, however, I couldn't tell if the flour shell was supposed to be soft or hard. It came in twos, and one was foldable and the other wasn't. Entree - European sea bass. The fish was done with crispy skin and flaky meat, which was perfect. Dessert - flourless chocolate cake. I'm not a fan of sweets, so all I can say is that it was very sweet.  Atmosphere: Located inside the Hazelton hotel. Looked upscale. We had a private room, so we had a lot of space to walk around and socialize within the group, without distracting other patrons.  Decor was nothing fancy in our room, but the lobby was nice.  Service: We made reservations but still had to wait a little more than half an hour because they were going to seat us at two different tables. The waiter didn't come around as much as I would have preferred to refill waters. These were the two main reasons that I only gave them a 3/5.  It's a nice restaurant in general with good food. I never think summerlicious menus are really worth it, but this one was okay. The portions were a little small, but perfect for me so that I wasn't stuffed."}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant at all costs. The service was deplorable. It took 20 minutes just to get water which was never refilled. We had to ask for the dessert menu which we never received. I would expect much more from an establishment that charges $50 for an entree."}
{"text":"Terrible drinks (doubt there was any alcohol in them) and food mediocre. Lunch bill $84. Try something else - this place stinks and the staff is cold (too bad the drinks weren't)."}
{"text":"One restaurant is Mark McEwans \"be seen\" Yorkville restaurant connected to the Hazelton hotel. When it first opened the food didn't match the hype or the expensive. This reputation, along with it's sometimes seedy clientele (think ladies of the night and the type of men who accompany them) displaced One as being in a top teir restaurant category. All though the scene can still be seedy, the people watching is fantatsic and food is incredible. Additonally, their real estate can't be matched in the summer, their patio wraps around the Yorkville / Hazelton corner and is the perfect place to enjoy a $2o omelette. Other than being extremely hard to decide what to get, I think their menu is a masterpiece. There is something for everyone.   I am always impressed by the level of quality seafood. For a restaurant that doesn't specialize in seafood, it is the star of the show. My favourite dishes include, lobster carbonara, lobster rose, tuna tartare, tuna tacos, truffles fries and the side dish of beets.  When they are busy, the service can be atrocious, especially in the summertime when they are busy. The restaurant serves Boulart bread which is fresh and usually warm. I highly recommend taking a piece if it is busy because it might be awhile until they come back and take your order."}
{"text":"A big hell no to this place.  This place reminds me of The Ivy in LA - and if that's your scene then great - but upon noting this comparison, I immediately wanted to run/hide/cry but I couldn't because my overpriced ricotta pasta-less pasta was still on it's way.   Lesson learnt - if you're into eating burnt eraser or hob nobbing with the vapid whilst paying ginormous amounts of money that would probably buy a few hundred med kits for kids in some developing nation - then yeah go at it!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Went to One on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. It was a beautiful day and I made a reservation for me and a friend. The menu was alright, nothing fancy except for the price. The food was okay, a little underwhelming if anything.   The hostess was nice but the server was a total weirdo. She barely responded to our questions/requests that she came off as rude.   For instance, I got there before my friend. While waiting, she comes and pours me and my friend (who's not there) water.   Me: Hi, do you have any cider? Server: No. (curtly)  And walks away!  Doesn't bother checking on me for the next 10 minutes. Finally my friend calls and tells me she'll be there in 5 minutes. 2 minutes later the server comes back - \"Hun, are you okay. Would you like anything?\"   I'm thinking where were you the last 10-12 minutes when I wanted to order a drink. I say \"Nevermind, my friend will be here in 2-3 minutes, I'll wait.\" She responds \"I figured\".   Another instance. I asked for a glass of water, and she just walked away. I was shocked and told my friend that there was no way I would tip her for being so rude.  I'm mad, but my friend and I find this hilarious. She comes back few minutes later with water to confuse me even more. It's the basic response to a request - \"Yes\" or \"Sure\" or \"In a second\" etc. This happened all afternoon and you just expect better service at a place like this.  Couldn't care about going back. Food was meh."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. The only good part is the heated patio, where you can stare at douch-y men with their escorts. .   The lunch was so non-exciting: Hamburger was so overpriced, my steak salad came with 2 strips of mini-tenderloin, the order came back wrong a few times as thought it was our fault, the eggs were undercooked and it's just a bunch of nonsense. I'm all for cool, hip places...as long as they have something to deliver."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch/ lunch only on a sunny day to enjoy the patio with my mom. Staff was very attentive, food was brought promptly (though we didn't order anything too complicated).  Food itself was good but nothing out of this world. The patio is great if you are looking to be amused by the yorkville crowd. Fellow diners are a mix between obnoxious, extremely tacky wannabes, first dates and people watchers amusing themselves by watching the latter."}
{"text":"we anticipated an amazing meal, but the bread was hard, the chicken soup salty and felt like it was out of a can and the chicken schnitzel way over breaded and not tasty. my wife enjoyed the tomato salad."}
{"text":"Very nice food and great desert but the service was just average."}
{"text":"My family of 5 , two adults two 13 years old and a seven year old arrived for brunch without reservations and the hostess asked us to see if there was room and after about 5 minutes she lead us to the dining room to a round table in the middle of the entrance despite the fact of the dining had only two full tables and remained so till we left plus another family had to tables against the wall put together . The waitress came after 10 minutes and took our drink order and disappeared till the manager served our drinks ,then we ordered eggs benedict which arrived without any sauce hollandaise , the rest of the food was below what get at sazzfraz for example even sunset grill beat their food and the waitress kept disappearing and the manager doing her job till the bill then she was al smiles and asking if everything is ok ! didn't want to list everything wrong we just paid our bill and left . save your nerves and head elsewhere when in Yorkville like moroco at least they have lovely deserts ."}
{"text":"I just got back from France and Italy..I had better food at the smaller cafe's and mom and pop restaurants.I couldn't believe how slow the service was on a Monday afternoon on the patio.  Our server took the order of the 2 males FIRST at my table. (not impressed)  It's ladies first... Anyone knows that in the restaurant business. Right?  Our table noticed that tables that got seated after us received their meals ahead of time while we were still waiting on our apps..(oysters and lobster tail)  REALLY?????  A gust of wind lifted up a menu that knocked over a glass of water which spilled all over the table on my side into my lap which left me soaking wet. My cell phone got wet as well ....(Look I understand Mother Nature it happens) It was the events after that disturbed me.  When I got up to use the napkin to clean myself up, the server, clearly seeing this, she just proceeded to talk to my 2 males friends about the Louis Roederer Champagne that she wanted to open up and serve..  I WAS SOAKING WET.IT WAS OBVIOUS!!... OMG!!..I needed another napkin, SOMETHING to dry myself off and to dry up the spillage on the table in front of me.  I said to the server, \" Can you please get me a napkin to help me DRY OFF and to clean the table\"  The response was \"SURE AFTER I OPEN THE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE\"  REALLY??? I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE RESPONSE..REALLY?? I HAD TO WAIT FOR HER TO PRESENT THE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE FIRST AND STAND THERE SOAKING WET AND MY PHONE WAS WET AND MY SEATING WAS WET..REALLY??  I RESPONDED \"NO I NEED THE NAPKINS NOW IT CAN'T WAIT\"  WOW!!!   APPALLED......SHOCKED  I would never expect this service in what is perceived as one of Toronto's top Patio's. Upscale? Not even close.  The poor service  The dress code of the hostesses needs an overhaul,my server needs etiquette classes.(micro mini tight skirts with worn out tops and tattered shoes?  Long waits, lacking etiquette,no attention to details and the MERE CONCERN OF A PATRON is appalling in an establishment of this nature. On an overpriced bill of $700 for brunch.  Not the first visit but DEFINITELY the last!!  An INSULTED patron."}
{"text":"I haven't stayed at the hotel, but I live in the neighborhood and watched them cut down all the trees on the street and tear down the turn of century walk ups that used to line the streets when they built it. I was there during the construction to build the eye sore that is the Hazelton Hotel, and I now get the pleasure of being judged by cheap LA wannabe cast-offs every time I walk by. The bellhop uniforms are as cheap as the patrons and the patio is set up to basically look at everyone else on it as well as the street. The service is middle of the road and so is the food. Overall, the restaurant is a perfect reflection of the hotel itself, a vast pool of vacuity. Hey, at least it's true to its clientele."}
{"text":"This place reeks of botox, fake tan, viagra packing grandaddies, LA wannabes and old ladies with one too many face lifts! The drinks aren't nearly as stiff as they should be to have the clientele get over themselves. Haven't eaten there, true, but wouldn't want to either. They ruined some beautiful old Toronto character with yet another ugly building. Yorkville is so  wannabe something it's not. Instead of embracing its hippie heritage and trend setting potential, it is where you find poor little rich girls and unfortunate joan rivers lookalikes!"}
{"text":"Do you watch Entourage?  If so, they could use this place as a backdrop for Vince and the gang.  While I did not take in any food --- I, along with some friends checked out the bar last night.  The place was rammed with some serious trolling action.  If you're one of the \"look at me, look at me\" crowd --- you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place!  I must admit, I was impressed with the amount of eye candy even though its not my scene.  That said, it's well worth checking out at least once.  +ives: can have a heart to heart chat with your local Raptor -ives: stay away if you have an aversion to silicone and latex."}
{"text":"I went to One restaurant on July 23 for dinner.My two friends and I were so excited to visit there. It was the one of  the fine dine restaurantes in Toronto we really wanted to try. It is a really a beautiful looking restaurant, especially, the Patio, and the nice interior and the amazing food we have experienced.  However, we were so disappointed with the service!!!. The Waiter treated me so bad. It was so obvious that he humiliated us.  We were waiting for him to order food for 30 mins.  Eventually, We should have called him to order food.. Moreover, when he served our wine the wine were spilt around the glass and never say sorry.. He was so rush at serving all of our food and took out the dishes so quickly.  But not to the other tables. He took pictures for the next to our table for customers . And smailed them but not for us. Finally, we asked for the separated bills. But he said no. I never saw this  Behavior ever in any restaurants in Toronto.  I realized that he is totally ignoring and humiliated us.  We didnt want to pay tips because of him and a big humiliation.  However, we did tips. We thought tips for food. He does not deserve it.   We are Korean our English aren't good. That is why he treated us like that. That is our conclusion for the situatuon last night in One!! I was going to ask his name that I could complain.  But I did not. I just assumed that he is a racist. We were telling ourselves that never never here again!!!!   Good food. But immature person works there. I don't want to hurt my mind and waste my money on it. The restaurant needs to spend more time when it comes to hire waiters with good mindset. If the One wishes to keep their good reputation."}
{"text":"On 8/20/16 we reserved at The One on opentable because of the location, then read some reviews (newest first) and canceled.  But we inadvertently ended up there anyway, and really really liked the food.  Staff was good and and gave good service.  One server was more the curt-efficient CA[nadian] style than the style in the other CA[lifornia, where we're live), you know: \"Hi, I'm your server, how are you folks doing today.\"  She warmed up when we complimented her on her gorgeous nails. Everyone else was cheerful and competent from the get-go, without being smarmy/vapid. {OUR ACCIDENTAL VISIT: Since we were going for an early dinner, we decided after canceling that rez to walk around Yorkville and see what looked good.  We came across a patio with many happy diners - didn't notice the place's name - and  asked if they had a table for us even though we had no reservation.  The hostess - in a smashing dress which we said was designed for the restaurant when we noticed it on another hostess, too - said most of the patio was filled but they had 2 tables at the end on Hazelton that we could see, or we could sit inside.  We checked out the outside tables, both at the very end of the patio on the side street.  We LOVED the farthest - bigger than usual, with no nearby tables, and less car or foot traffic than in the front. She said it was where she sat movie stars.  (Joke?  Didn't matter.) True, it was (a) next to a bussing station so there was the occasional sound of crockery, and (b) the piped-to-the-outside - and unnecessary - music was a louder than we liked, but basically it was a fine table.  Then I looked at the menu and laughed, \"This is the place we just canceled because of the terrible reviews, bad service, cheating on the bill ...\"  My husband said, \"Well, it seems very popular.  Let's give it a try.\"}  FOOD:  We each had a glass of wine (good, but not particularly memorable, and then salads.  H had the kale ceasar.  Delicious.  Bits of bacon, a mild horseradish flavor, beautiful kale.  I had the heirloom carrot.  The carrots, although very pretty to look at with a nice grilled texture, were alas without flavor. The rest of the salad - the greens, avocado, pistachios, pickled golden raisins - were, however, fabulous.   We next shared a hamburger, cooked to our order, with good pickles and fries, and a side of sweet potato. The sweet potatoes were excellent, cooked perfectly, with sunflower seeds and a bit of creamy dressing which tasted lovely and was nicely decorative but was unnecessary to us.  We were going just to have coffee after that but read the dessert menu and when we saw that we could get a scoop of Ontario Strawberry sorbet for $3, we ordered it. Utterly delicious.  I don't usually bother to write reviews - and always am suspicious of good reviews following bad ones, esp. on yelp - but just had to speak up on this one.  (Also, we checked the addition on our bill:  no mistakes.)  We'd go back.  And would specially reserve that movie star table."}
{"text":"Again, enjoyed a wonderful brunch here after mass at St. Thomas anglican church, and before leaving town.   Enjoyed the smoked salmon rosti/scrambled egg dish which they have changed a little -- still good, but I prefer the old way of cooking the potatoes. The bread choice is still wonderful, even love the butter balls and jam. They also make a great bloody mary (and I am very critical of a bloody).  Chic ambience outdoors, though they could use some more umbrellas on the patio on a 90 degree day. (It would be nice to have those wonderful outdoor air conditioners, but  I realize this is Toronto).  Very nice brunch, the only mar being the loud, obnoxious and very nouveau family closely seated at the next table."}
{"text":"I found the food very overpriced for what it is.The atmosphere is pretty (prime Toronto location - Yorkville) but my food was a bit bland. I went there for lunch and had poached eggs with lobster. The Chicken Tacos are actually delicious but the portions are small so come half full. No complaints about the service but I don't think it is worth the money for lunch. Dinner may be a completely different experience but I can't speak to that."}
{"text":"Summerlicious website shows separate lunch and dinner menus, has separate lunch and dinner prices, has a website link to reserve lunch, so imagine my surprise when we I asked for the summerlicious menu I was told rather rudely and abruptly that no I can't.    I thought it might be just a time of day thing, so I asked what time I would be able to order from that menu and was told it wasn't available on weekends.  I can see from another yelper review that apparently I'm not the only one that has been caught by this misdirection.   Canoe doesn't usually open on weekends but has been able to run summerlicious for years on weekends without a hitch, One needs to get their act together.  Walked out and had a fantastic lunch at Wish."}
{"text":"I am proud to be among those who rate this restaurant a one and lonely star! In search of a nice place to have brunch, we found \"One\". It looked great and classy. Nice patio. I recalled that I heard from a couple of friends about this restaurant. So why not give it a shot.  The atmosphere was nice. We couldn't get a seat in patio, so we sat inside. Nice high ceiling, great wallpapers, nice entrance. We sat by the window. So far so good.  We waited for the server to come, like 5 minutes, to get the order. There were some dishes on the menu that we were not sure what they are. no help from the server to explain, as our server was in such a rush, So we ordered something, and asked for the coffee. Nice. We were excited although a bit surprised by how much we were rushed to order.  10 minutes later, there is still no coffee (which actually cost you $4.50). Asked for it and it took another 2 more minutes. Ok, good, but wait a sec. there was no milk. Hmmm, strange as i think a lot of the people! drink their coffee with milk. Now we asked for milk, which took another 5 minutes.  The food came about 15 more minutes later.... ooof. We were really hungry by now.  The food was OK, not something that you expect from a restaurant like this. Definitely (DEFINITELY!) not worth half of what it is charged for. The presentation was pretentious, but not practical nor memorable.  The little food didn't make us full enough. still being hungry we asked for the desert menu. Then we had to wait another 15 minutes to order. By now we have given up.  Something that really annoyed us was when one of the servers, in rush, squeezed her way though a group of lovely people who were helping an older lady to sit. I have to say, we found it quite franckly disgusting!   Atmosphere: 8/10 Food: 7/10 Service: 2/10 (for the type of restaurant it is) Price: 2/10  Will never even cross from the same pavement, let alone to eat here."}
{"text":"PLACE IS GROSS - Sure I'm a business guy who wears a suit, takes clients out, has a large expense account utilizing a colored American Express, loves great dinners and atmosphere...but...this place is nauseating.  Im sorry, can the \"people\" in the bar try any harder for attention.  Oh man - Yorkville is too much at the best of times, but the bar at One takes that to a whole new level of yuck.  If I want to spend money to see hungry Cougars, Ill go to the recently out of business Elmvale Jungle Zoo.  Seriously, people, give your head a shake; your not impressing anyone.  And to the nice \"lady\" I met at the bar who started to talk to me, no my name is not Rex and no Im not from Azerbaijan...ya weirdo..."}
{"text":"I was excited to try One, and my girlfriends and I chose to go for our monthly brunch. I was so disappointed in the quality of food, and the service wasn't what I expected.  Out of 4 of our meals, 2 had to go back. One was incorrect, and the other wasn't hot - luke warm at best. I will say both meals were corrected very quickly thought which was nice.  I ordered the Beef Brisket Hash, and there was no flavour. The potatoes tasted boiled with no spice/seasoning, no crunch and the brisket also lacked flavour. The eggs were cooked to medium, which was ok, but I would have preferred slightly more runny as I've experienced at other restaurants. The meal was also on the small size.  The server was polite, but I could have found her more attentive. I had to flag her down so we could order more drinks, and to report my meal wasn't hot.  Overall, for the price they charge (granted, nothing extreme but more than average for brunch), the food and service didn't deliver. Sadly I won't return for brunch, and discouraged to try for lunch or dinner. I suggest people check out Morocco Chocolat across the street - much better food, services with a slightly smaller bill at the end.  I give 2 stars for the atmosphere, and food presentation (I wish it tasted as good as it looked!)."}
{"text":"This is, visually, a nice restaurant, both inside and out.  We had a business dinner on the patio on a perfect early summer evening.  I had the iceberg lettuce salad, grass fed PEI strip, and berry crumble. We also had a Napa Cab and some cocktails and sides.  The food was hit and miss.  The iceberg lettuce salad was unique and nicely presented - it was literally half of a lettuce, topped with coloured grape tomatoes, avocado, and what tasted like an avacado cream dressing. I'd give this dish 3.5 to 4 stars - unique and good.  The strip was a significant disappointment. It was served with tomato salsa (you could also choose bernaise). I ordered mine medium rare, they brought it out and said it was medium, and was cooked essentially well done. There was significant fat on the meat, the taste was bland with little marbling, the salsa did not complement the meat at all, and this was not a good dish. 1 star.  The dessert was delicious. I devoured it. It was served with a little scoop of ice cream. 4 stars.  The Napa cab was good and juicy. Sides included beets with goat cheese and green and white asparagus. Decent. 3 stars.  Portions were fine and sizable.  This is Yorkville, so prices, while I did not pay, are not a bargain by any stretch.  Service was mediocre and periodically inattentive - we had to ask for wine glasses and flag the server down to get more drinks.  Was it a very nice evening on the patio? Absolutely. Would I return? Absolutely not, unless it's on someone else's tab!"}
{"text":"How many staff can have dumb vacant stares and emit unintelligible grunts in this over-priced tourist trap? Service awful, food very average, prices ridiculously high."}
{"text":"Very sophisticated and modern restaurant. You kind of feel like a celebrity eating here. I dined here in the summer and chose to eat indoors to keep cool under the shade.The salad was fresh and the spaghetti dish was quite nice."}
{"text":"Great patio, great service. I had the lobster spoons and sweet potato fries....both were delicious."}
{"text":"Came by for a late afternoon lunch. Poor service constantly had to wave for a server, had the spaghettini which was quite bland I had to top it off with plenty of extra cheese. It was very quiet for a Friday evening which was quite surprising especially when we couldn't find a server for more then 10 miniatures. There were plenty of support staff but no one around to replenish a simple drink order. Definitely will not be recommending to friends or coming back."}
{"text":"Four star ambiance, 3 star food, drinks and service.  There really isn't much more to say about this place. After two meals and three drink visits, I was underwhelmed. However, the location is great and the space is pretty and vibrant. There are worse ways to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"Didn't honour lunchtime summerlicious reservation made through website. Manager blamed the city's website and said we weren't the first to have this issue. I have no idea why we weren't told this when they called in the morning to confirm the reservation. Horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Location: In Yorkville, with underground parking right across the street.  Facility: Modern and clean, but exactly what you would expect from an upscale restaurant. Ambiance was generally nice, but it was very loud. So loud to the point where the server couldn't hear our orders and we had to repeat ourselves multiple times.  Food Quality & Price: The Eggs Benedict for brunch was fairly priced and very delicious. I was very happy with my choice.  Service: Slow and not very attentive. It took a fair amount of time to receive our orders, and the server rarely checked in.  Overall: Likely one of the shortest reviews I've ever written. ONE was decent, but nothing spectacular. I don't think I would return unless I was invited by a friend."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. We dined inside right at 9 pm and were the only ones inside on a Saturday night. Food was excellent service was excellent price was high but not over the top. Just a 30 minute walk from down town so very convenient."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner outside at One. The food was delicious and the servers personable and attentive. One does, however, pay for the quality and location. To start, we had truffled frites with Reggiano. The frites themselves were delicious as was the truffle aioli for dipping.  Our other starter was fresh, flavorful heirloom tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella. The entrees were also delicious. The ravioli with sweet pea and mascarpone, brown butter, summer truffle and Pecorino Romano was rich and luscious. The black cod with miso glaze and ginger butter sauce was perfectly cooked -- flaky, delicate with a savory miso crust. For dessert, the panna cotta with Ontario strawberry sorbet, etc. was beautiful to look at and an the palate.  The selection of Quebec cheeses was diverse and tasty, served with bread, apple and pear slices, honey, and pear compote. There is a good selection of wines by the glass and a better than average selection in half bottles.  Tip: if you are eating outside, try to sit on Hazleton Avenue, which has less traffic than Yorkville Avenue.  (Note that we had started eating the entrees before I remembered to take pictures.)"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a girls night out. Amazing tuna tartare and short, but \"sweet\" cocktail list. Their patio in the summer leaves ONE, \"the one place\" to be for a Sunday brunch/get-together with friends. Service is super slow at times, hence the 3 stars, and  seating is always limited as the place is small, and if you do not book in advance Fri-Sun you are most likely to get disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there for My Birthday Celebration Dinner. What a Fancy Restaurant !  Very helpful staff. There was even a tiny stool near my chair for me to keep my handbag. I loved the cocktail \"lipstick\". The food was okay. The chef came out and greeted me at our table and wished me a very happy birthday. He gave us two complimentary dishes. I was also given a small complimentary birthday dessert. The washrooms are beautiful and clean. We really enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"came here for drinks. it was an older crowd. we always walk by and the patio is solidly packed every time."}
{"text":"Came here knowing very little about what the restaurant is supposed to be. It has a nice interior, the dining room is quite beautiful. It has some distinctive features, which makes it interesting. There is a decent by the glass wine list, and a pretty large menu (was there for lunch). There are appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta, seafood, meat, vegetables and other sides. The prices are not bashful, but mostly what you would expect for this type of restaurant. I ordered a beef soup which came with a bone marrow crostini, and a tagliatelle with tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella and basil. The soup was good, and the bone marrow bread was great. The pasta was well done as well, very good. There was solid service throughout the meal, but there was no \"wow\" factor anywhere. It was by no means disappointing, but I also left feeling no gravitation to go back, at least if it were going to be on my bill."}
{"text":"ARE.  YOU.  SERIOUS?!  $20 for a martini?!   I have never paid that for a drink even at a 5 star resort EVER - and it was CRAP: sugar - sent it back.  What a bunch of snobs!  I KacKed through my glass of white wine hoping everyone with me would agree to get the hell out and cut our losses with with drink each and LEAVE - we did - to hemmingways across the street.  (did i mention that 1 of their glasses of wine was SIXTY BUCKS?!?!)  We got a BOTTLE of awesome white wine from new zealand for $28 (avg price here for like a bloody GLASS) & fabby food across the street on a hipper, funner place where the action was - so glad we saved the nite - AND the credit card - by doing so!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived with our twins stroller for a late lunch and the staff treated us very kindly. The service was great and the food was of great quality. The best we've had in a long time! I had the chicken salad which was fresh and savoury. My husband had the eggs Benedict and was raving about the chefs skill. The chicken soup was like a homemade one..... The staff were very accommodating even tried to bring us toys for the babies. The wine by glass was a 2012 Chardonnay, exquisite!"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful; great big outdoor patio, loungey bar area and upscale dining room with great comfortable armchairs and an even an ottoman for the table!  We were late arriving from Montreal and the staff was great about pushing back our reservations...although the dining room was quite empty at 9:30 on a Friday night.   Everything on the drinks and food menu sounded delicious and after ordering an extravagant cocktail we decided to share a few appetizers.   Everything was fantastic and well-presented.   The BBQ duck rolls were melt-in-your-mouth good and arrived on a wood plank as did the chicken wing tacos which had a great zesty sauce. The truffle aioli fries were well-seasoned and the beet salad with buffala was great (in true Top Chef fashion). The eggplant dish was equally delicious.   Our only complaint was the very slow and scarce service. We literally had to hunt down a hostess on the patio as there was no one inside and had to flag down a bus-boy to get a waitress to bring our bill.   The place definitely gets top marks on food but for what we paid, I expected better service."}
{"text":"I think this place is better than what people give them credit for.  Sure, it is more on the expensive end, the people that goes there are the snobby yorkville crowd with way too much botox, and the service strictly depends on how much money you look like you have, but the food is always delicious. I've been there few times. In the summer I recommend sitting on the patio, a great place for people watching. The winter, their decor inside is warm and cozy.   First of all, their bread is great! I love the red pepper focaccia. I've had their calamari, fois gras, and chicken taco for apps, all good dishes. One dish I always get here is their tomato sauce tangliatelle. It's so simple and it's my favourite pasta dish in town. The tomato sauce is fresh, sweet, and spicy. Pasta cooked just right. Makes me hungry just thinking about it.   Default place to eat in Yorkville for sure, around the same price point but better food than Sassafras."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on the patio, which is wonderfully designed and spacious, with large umbrellas for shade. The eggs and french toast were fine, service was attentive and prompt, if a bit distant. A nice place to get dressed up and enjoy a nice patio, we found the food just average and overpriced."}
{"text":"Winterlicious. Good portions and excellent service. Desserts could have been better. Location was excellent as well. Main was very well done."}
{"text":"I fondly recall a dinner here a few years ago, and more recently recall a lot of drinks had here in the last few months.  Heart of Yorkville; great service; great drinks. Beautiful decor - this is a place to be seen, certainly. This is also a place to have a terrific set of after-work-Xmas-party-drinks... :-)"}
{"text":"After vowing to myself I wouldn't be back because of snotty server, I ended up at One again and it was a win. Service was great and friendly, truffle frites and taleggio ravioli to die for. Blueberry pie was great too. Best fries in the city, which forced me to go back yet again for a quick lunch - chicken noodle soup is boring, so skip it."}
{"text":"I sat on the patio with my husband to enjoy an appetizer and a cocktail as a snack while we strolled through Yorkville. There were small yellow/green bugs/spiders EVERYWHERE! I killed probably 6 as we sat out there...i think they drop from the hanging trees. It was so gross. The drinks were very subpar and lacked something special - at $19 a cocktail, I expect a great cocktail. I was disappointed overall with this place."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service. I chose the restaurant for my birthday dinner. The food and restaurant itself were lovely, but I really can't stress enough how rude our waiter was. Lots of blank stares and disinterested looks, taking our order seemed to be a waste of his time. We also waited with our empty plates in front of us for 20 minutes while he gave the tables around us what we overheard to be very friendly service. I'm assuming this is because my boyfriend and I are in our mid 20's and the nearby tables were older couples. I realize Yorkville is known to be a snobby part of town, but I have frequented other restaurants in the area and have never had a service issue. Apparently if you are under 30 you aren't allowed to eat at this restaurant and receive good service. I would recommend going in with your Chanel bag and Gucci loafers or you'll be waiting quite a while to be checked up on by your waiter."}
{"text":"This is my second time at One - I Went to this restaurant for lunch on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Although there are 'snooty' people about, the food is definitely decent. If you focus on the price then it may not be as enjoyable, but depedning on what you order the experience can be pleasant. The waiters both times I went were a bit standofish at first, however by the time the meal is served for the most part the snobish airs wear off."}
{"text":"This is a sexy place. To my fellow reviewers grumbling about the high number of douches: pipe down. This restaurant is attached to the Hazelton hotel- who exactly were you expecting to see, besides the expense account crowd? The food was generally quite good, with the exception of my chicken soup (see below).  As for atmosphere, I sat on the patio on a nice day, and was very pleased with the ambience and service. I came here for lunch, and ordered the chicken noodle soup, sea scallops, and sea-buckthorn sorbet for dessert. First, the bad: the chicken noodle soup was salty enough to be nearly inedible. I left the broth and picked out the chicken and noodles- the former was decent, the latter was floppy and overcooked. I've had better chicken soup at Swiss Chalet.   The scallops were beautiful, and finished with a delicious parsnip puree. My only complaint was the portion size: though I am aware of (and perfectly okay with) the fact that top-notch food often comes in small portions, this one was tiny (2 scallops), and would fit this menu much better as a starter, in my opinion. No complaints, taste-wise.  The star of my meal was the vibrant, tangy sea-buckthorn sorbet, which arrived in an unassuming indented bowl, with no garnish... which was fine, because it didn't need any. The sorbet was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy, with a really delicious, memorable flavour, thanks to the unusual key ingredient. I would go back just for the sorbet.  My mother had a striploin salad, which I tried and enjoyed very much, though I thought it was a little heavy on the blue cheese- a strong ingredient, which in my opinion, should be used sparingly so as not to overwhelm the other flavours.  Overall, not quite worth the price tag, though I would have given it four stars if it weren't for the downright unpleasant chicken soup."}
{"text":"For a restaurant charging 22$ for a green salad, I would expect much better. We were appealed by the patio on Yorkville that seemed comfortable, so we have it a chance, for the last time.  First off, we had to wait over 20 minutes to have a waitress coming over and ask is if we wanted something to drink. We had time to even select our food since his waiting was so long!  Even if we asked to the waitress if the foie gras and the Brie were sweet and she answered by the negative, we could not imagine anything sweeter than those 2 appetizers. Watch out if you are diabetic!   On top of that, she got one of our 2 simple appetizer wrong and they brought us a wrong one.  After we complained about the extremely sweet dishes we had, we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. Both of my husband and I have felt sick to our stomach the entire evening following our visit at One! Imagine paying a 200$ bill and be sick? Hats unacceptable!  The manager of the restaurant -- who has actually been very kind and the one star I'm giving is only dedicated to her -- came see us and apologized for the terrible dining experience we just had. It was nice of her to do it and we appreciated her apology. Unfortunately, it didn't take away our stomachache!"}
{"text":"The first time I went I was blown away by the flavour of the dishes, the second time I went I was less impressed with flavour. The cocktails are great, the service is great though I could hardly understand what choices of bread I could choose from. The menu changes so I expect that they will have amazing food over and over, and I will always come back."}
{"text":"There's something slightly shady here.  I don't know if it's the clientele or the staff. Walked in for a patio table and was told they just had to clean a table up and to wait in the bar.  Overheard her telling another customer that only the north patio was available at the late hour, so I ignored the fact that 2 tables were ready right in front. Waited for 10 minutes and went back out to check.  Still waiting for table to be cleaned. Waited for 10 minutes and went back out - STILL waiting for table to be cleaned (mind you, the 2 tables by hostess stand were clean, but I'd overheard they're no longer seating out front). Finally, she came to get us and seated us at the table NEXT TO THE HOSTESS STAND that had been ready since we walked in. I think this is a ploy to get you to buy drinks in the empty bar first.  Shady. Seated 2 completely drunk girls next to us.  Obnoxious.  She told the waiter how drunk she way, yet when they ordered another drink, they brought it out. Tacky clientele.  Shady service. On a positive note - the food wasn't bad and it's a sexy restaurant with great people watching.  Very expensive."}
{"text":"Gather around, friends, and let me tell you a story...  My first experience with One Restaurant happened by accident. A few years back, after trying (unsuccessfully) to bluff my way into an Alliance Atlantis TIFF party with a pair of producer friends, someone suggested that we make our way up to Yorkville and see what was happening. Yorkville (despite being the trendy part of the city) has a strange small-town feel to it - lots of cobbled walkways and small businesses that make it a haven for tourists, celebrities and hipsters alike.  Our group soon found ourselves at the front entrance of a CBC bash being held inside the restaurant. With a little bit of exploration (and the help of a pair of programmers from the station), we walked right past security and got inside without a hassle.  We were immediately handed legs of lamb as we stepped inside. It was probably the best lamb I've ever had at a restaurant - succulent and full of flavour. We proceeded to spend the next eight hours at that party, in a whirlwind of celebrity encounters and amusement. Standing on the patio and watching Chantel Kreviazuk have a drink with her friend while \"Dreamweaver\" blasted in my head. Seeing Kiefer Sutherland shotgunning mineral water with a girl on each arm. Having a waitress give us half a bottle of vodka for no reason. Watching my friend get into a shouting match with John Lyman (The Sex Pistols) in the middle of the dance floor. Hors d'oeurves for days.  It's a party that, five years later, my friends still use as the metric for amazing parties. I've been to the restaurant twice since then (most recently a month ago, as of this writing) and the quality and consistency was still very high. The calamari was a particular highlight, and the server was very prompt and polite.  One Restaurant is definitely a place you should check out if you're in the neighborhood. If not for the \"see and be seen\" atmosphere, do it for the amazing food."}
{"text":"I was considering giving ONE a rating of 1 but that wouldn't be fair. Two is what it deserved so that is what I gave it. The chicken taco was the highlight of the meal, but given it was an appetizer, that isn't the best thing to feel at the end of eating an expensive dinner. The lobster spoons were just ok. I expected more. My sister had the octopus and she didn't like it. On to the main entrees. Two of us had steak and it was good but for that hefty price it should be. We didn't buy it being 20 oz bone-in rib eye. It didn't look anywhere near that size. The side dishes were mixed. Bok Choy wasn't great, chived potatoes were fine as were the mushrooms. Desserts were again fine but not great. You get a thin slice of cheese cake. The bill for the 4 of us came out to approximately $500 and that is with no alcohol.   Now I am going to get to the part of the evening that totally ruined anything good we felt from the evening. We looked closely at the bill since it was the highest we ever spent and we saw an error. The items didn't add up to the total. I checked and later 2 other members of my party checked. It didn't add up. We were upset that they are having bills that don't add up. We told the waitress and eventually the manager came over. He said some lame excuse about one of our items not being on the bill but yet was in the total. Made no sense why it didn't show up listed in the items. He offered us NOTHING. We felt that was wrong so he gave us a whole $6 off the bill. Yes, I mean SIX dollars. He wouldn't budge on the amount. Finally he said he would throw in some cookies and cheese cake. He ended up putting in cookies that don't look great and none of us ordered cookies for dessert, as he knew. He threw in one slice of the cheese cake for ruining it for 4 people. We let him know we weren't happy with his resolution and he didn't care. Go to ONE if you want one helluva lousy experience."}
{"text":"We celebrated my 60th birthday at One Restaurant at the Hazelton Hotel last night and I had to write a review because it was without a doubt the most incredible dinner of my lifetime.   The Chef and his very talented wife (pastry chef) provided a feast for 11 people that would have drawn accolades from the good people at Michelin.   We started with a series of appetizers,highlights including Fogo Island cod, buttery lobster spoons, light as air crispy calamari and two different lettuce wrapped offerings (wonderfully flavourful chicken & beef). My favourite was a wild mushroom gnocchi with truffle dust.  Our main courses included the 40 oz Tomahawk rib steaks with four sauces, broiled lobsters with grilled corn, and grilled Branzino, Mediterranean style. Every dish was prepared with the greatest care and each was executed flawlessly. The flavours were all outstanding and all dishes were cooked to perfection.  Our desserts were no less incredible than the dinner. We were served an amazing spiced pumpkin pie with Chantilly cream, several different donuts (some filled with preserves, some with house made ice creams), three different funnel cakes, with toppings including sliced caramelized apples and stewed strawberries and delicious white Oreo milkshakes served in miniature milk bottles with candy-stripped straws. I think these were created specifically for my two grandchildren, who were over the moon with delight.  The service was exceptional. The evening was unforgettable.  For a memorable occasion you could not pick a better venue. We were given the back room, which added to the magic of the evening."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Attentive but not overbearing. Apps and entre were excellent. Had Halibut cooked perfectly. Partner had pasta with lobster that was delicious. Only complaint was they could be a little more discerning re: dress code. Is it to much to ask for a $200plus meal for two, not to allow jeans, or heaven forbid require a jacket. Elegance is not a bad thing, just a disappearing experience."}
{"text":"I would normally give One Restaurant a 4 start rating for good food and decent service however, my most recent visit was not peasant at all.  When I came to One restaurant for brunch our server seemed new, timid and nervous. Though I wouldn't normally care about this, she was not very attentive either missing the mark on checking our food, bringing us bread and asking how we are doing in a timely manner.   There is probably no way I would ever return because the restaurant clearly had a fly problem! At any given moment there are 2-3 flies landing on my arm and hovering over my food! Keep in mind this is indoors (not patio) and not summer time either (visited in October). There were flies everywhere! Hovering around other patrons etc. and all the staff didn't seem to care one bit, it was disgusting, especially from a restaurant in a 5 star hotel.  Not going to be returning if I am paying in excess of $70 for brunch for 2 I at least want to eat without an insane amount of flies hovering and landing over my food, buzzing over my head and landing on my head and arms."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I've learned, it is that the opinion agreed upon by the collective usually always end up being stupid, and completely fallible.  Some people may feel angry about not being able to afford this place, as it is rather expensive. But that is simply no ones problem than you poor blokes. Step aside beatniks, while I execute a real review of this place!  A dinner here with with your friend will cost you on average your week's worth of groceries. And I'm not talking about your local Chinese supermarket. It's at the Hazelton Lanes Hotel for blood sakes, so anyone who venture here and is surprised by the astronomical prices, they're the actual pretentious fools. And yeah, in the summertime, ONE sections off their respective property for what is perhaps, the most 'happening' patio of the city. All of Toronto's up-and-coming socialites can be found here during all four seasons. The place starts buzzing as early as nine..the lounge at front at least.  There are two place for your mingling, the bar/lounge, and the restaurant itself. The full serviced bar gives seating to about ten people, and the rest of the place are lightly occupied by leather sofas, chairs, and wall mounted seating. Nothing is overdone. It is a perfect place for cigar smoking. But that luxury is long gone, thanks to Toronto's cry babies. A cocktail will start from fifteen dollars, and their definition of cocktail is anything with more than one form of liquid in it. So drink up quick before your ice melts....just kidding.  The second portion, and the focus is the restaurant. The space is simply Posh. The chair's arm rest are too low to allow any resting of your arms, but aside from that, the decorations are perfection. Everything fits! I was sat towards the kitchen, with a commanding view of the atmosphere. Every minute here was pleasant. The large table slightly behind me sat eight smartly dressed restaurant staff sampling a potential new menu. One of them looked like Bas Rutten, so I had to resist the urge to stare. Their wine menu is more extensive than I imagined, and one can manage to acquire a bottle of dessert wine from South America for as low as sixty bucks!  It was difficult choosing from a menu where almost everything seemed appealing. But in the spirit of the venue, I ordered the seared foie gras appetizer, and medium venison with fries (I overheard from the next table that the fries here were \"amazing\"). My company got the special, 'vinegar grilled chicken'. I was very skeptical.  Redbull & Vodka......fifteen bucks. Our service was VERY attentive, and extremely polite. Almost to an uncomfortable degree. I think there wasn't once they didn't apologize to us for..whatever they did.  I'm sorry, would you like another drink? I'm sorry, are you still working on it? I'm sorry, would you like more water? I'm sorry, here's your food... But, that's hardly anything to complain about.  The venison came medium rare, as the chef originally have suggested, as opposed to my demand of medium. However, I think his choice was more applicable to my dish. Vinegar chicken...my friend loved it. Me? Well, you know when you order the 4 piece combo from Popeyes', or KFC? And you get that big, but super tough piece that nobody really likes? That's the part she cut off for me to taste.....and it was tender. That's all I have to say about that. The foie gras was another story. First, before you start freaking out, it was a normal sized liver. Not the force fed kind that is yellow. Although, I have no objections to such delicacy. It was DELICOUSSSSSSSSSSS..!!!!!! Served on some kind of pastry, with..fruit..and honeycomb? Oh Em GEE...the flavours hit my taste buds one after the other. My friend whom was kind of a animal activist was reduced to a sympathizer at best. I really should just have ordered 5 servings of the foie gras instead. Really, I'm thinking about it. The restaurant also offered sturgeon caviar, the beluga kind I think, judging from the price. But it's okay, the place has Ketel One Vodka!  I wanted to see what would happen if I gave a tip that was less than average, despite being treated with great hospitality. Sure enough, the over friendly service quickly lowered to just civilized. I had another drink, secretly eavesdropping on the white guy beside my table cuddling his Asian prostitute.    I tried very hard to find something wrong with ONE, and having experienced five star establishments, I debated with myself whether to award this place the first five star I've given to any Toronto restaurant. My conclusion, obviously is because even though after the sheer fulfillment I was basking in, there still feels like something was missing. I don't know what, but no five star establishment should leave me debating. I wish to give it four and a half stars.   The next time I come here, I'm booking a room upstairs. Foie gras this good needs to conclude with sex."}
{"text":"One is the bar and restaurant located in the ever so nice Hazelton Hotel in Yorkville.  But don't let the fact that it's a \"hotel restaurant\" sway you to thinking this place is not grand . . .for it is just that.  Given I was a guest in the hotel- One was sort of my \"go to\" restaurant over the days that I was there.  It is open for breakfast/brunch, lunch and dinner and they are extremely accommodating if you want something from one menu at a different time.  The bar is dimly lit and seems to be the \"place to see and be seen\" in Yorkville as the seats at the bar were usually filled with locals who knew each other well and used the bar to catch up on that day's activities or to read the local paper.  I liked that the locals were friendly and immediately \"adopted me\" as one of their own, buying me drinks and suggesting things to do while I was in town.  The bartenders pour a good drink be it a simple Bloody Mary or a perfectly shaken martini.  They also were quick to welcome me to eat that their bar- something I availed myself of several times during my stay.  And it didn't matter what I ordered, the food at the Mark McEwen restaurant was very good albeit simply prepared without a lot of the \"frou frou\" that so many chefs think they need today.  I sampled the fresh oysters of the day and the tuna tartar as starters- both were quick to come up and served with a smile.  My favorite thing was probably the chicken salad \"Cobb style\" as the bacon was pancetta and the dressing was a vinaigrette versus the usual overbearing blue cheese dressing.  I also had some salmon for dinner one night that was also quite tasty.  And if you really want to indulge- have one of their excellent desserts.  I opted for the 6 freshly baked cookies and some vanilla ice cream, but the chocolate bread pudding was a close second choice.  The only thing I had that I wasn't crazy about was an omelet for breakfast as I thought the onions overwhelmed the dish and the eggs surrounding it were a bit on the gummy side.  Service is good although know if you are at the bar that the regulars may have your bartender's attention.  Too bad I was here in the Winter and couldn't sit out on the patio.  It would have been great for people watching and breakfast outside is one of my favorite things in life.  Oh well . . .there is always the next time . .and you can bet there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"So I am torn as I give this review. My experience at one was reserved to room service, so I can't say anything about the restaurant its self. My first experience was markedly lack luster. I had their oats (they use rolled, not steel cut. Any self-respecting lux hotel should do steel cut and any decent chef knows that) and a yogurt parfait. They used fat free yogurt. You can give people an option but gosh darnet, this is Canada and you folks have AMAZING cows. This is the home of Liberté among other excellent yogurt brands. At least offer a 2% or full fat yogurt. Fat free yogurt is a crime against dairy. Also, if you don't want to make the parfait sweeter, offer it with honey on the side. So two strikes.   Then late last night, we were extremely hungry. We ordered the burger, frite, the kale caesar and the perogis. Everything was very decent. The burger was a little too salty and a bit tough, but it was good. The fries were hot, crisp outside, soft inside and well salted, the perogis were fine, but the maple bacon compote was excellent. The salad was very pleasant. Again this morning, we were running out and wanted food. We got the pancakes and french toast. Both were definitely above average.The pancakes themselves were delicious -- crisp on the outside, pillowy centers and a buttery flavor. The toppings were nice too. Apples, sour creama nd maple for pancakes and vanilla mascapone, not-too-sweet blueberry preserves and maple syrup made for a nice balance of flavor on both counts.  Had this been a normal menu with normal prices at a normal place, I would have happily given 4 stars. But since many items cost 3 to 4 times what they would at a normal place, I think people deserve uniformly exceptional food. At other luxury hotels. I often receive it. So if it's a late night, you're on an expense account and you're hungry, go for it. Other than our breakfast the first day, our food was totally decent and occasionally very good. Just order carefully and ask questions to find your best options. But if you have time, head down to Scarborough and tell me how the haka chinese joints are..."}
{"text":"Satisfied with food. Problem is you have to wait at least two hours to be seated. Then when you do, you get a servant who forgets to bring the bread and butter unless you remind him of it. Then there is at least another half hour waiting to get your food. Remember not to go here with you are crazy hungay?!?!?? Like I was."}
{"text":"It's expensive alright, but the food is amazing, the decor is gorgeous and the service is excellent, so what the hell is everyone getting all uppity for? I don't think it's fair to rate a restaurant based on the pretentiousness of its clientele. Yes, expensive restaurants in trendy areas tend to attract d-bags, but that's not the fault of the restauranteur. Shaddup & enjoy your lobster."}
{"text":"Amazing food :) Loved it so much will be back soon for sure. Very friendly staff and polite."}
{"text":"I know five stars really need to be earned but based on my brunch and the quality of food that came out of that kitchen, I have to give this a 5.   I ordered the Bianca's Benedict, that includes Crab and Eggs Benedict. It was around $22 dollars but I've paid for much worse eggs benny at approx $16 dollar price point.  It was absolutely delicious. The patio was still a great spot and I'll recommend that particular brunch experience any time."}
{"text":"Stayed down the street at a friends place and went here for some apps and glass of wine before our dinner elsewhere. This place has great ambiance and atmosphere. We sat in the bar/lounge area. Cool, hip place and has an intimate vibe setting.   Sushi was amazing and also had the fried calamari and lobster spoons app. WOW ! They were soo good and a MUST try ! We didn't have too much food, since we were just stopping in but I would definitely like to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"The only advantage was that one restaurant for me is that it is very close to my home. The food is good but expensive. So you are paying for location... I remember the servers used to be a lot friendlier before... They are still good but something has changed... For the price you pay in this restaurant, you can have a better food and get the same service in a few other restaurants around. Try oyster as it is very fresh..."}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for amazing customer service, even though we didn't eat there! I was wandering around Toronto late on a Sunday night with my partner looking for a late night dessert spot. We went to One and noticed it was open but empty and everyone was cleaning up. One of the staff (probably a manager ?) told us they were closed so we asked if he could suggest another place for dessert. He said most places were closed but he'd check the back and see what he could come up with. He returns with a little box of house made cookies! Free of charge! And he was so nice about it, and the cookies were great. We happily enjoyed them while walking back to our hotel and vowed to return the next time we visit Toronto - thanks One for being awesome!!"}
{"text":"Love the food love the experience hate the prices LOL but over all always fun place to meet people and enjoy the atmosphere"}
{"text":"It's a Mark McEwan restaurant so the food is solid. I've dined here several times and have enjoyed each visit; the menu is varied but mostly offers tried-and-true new American fare that is executed well.   Service is friendly, if slightly inattentive at times. For example, on my most recent visit, the bread boy did not come around to offer us bread until we were well into our entrées, and an empty cappuccino mug was left on the table for the entirety of the meal. However, the staff are mostly well-intentioned and do a decent job for the most part.  Dinner can be slightly pricey, but weekend brunch is an absolute bargain, with a variety of reasonably-priced classic breakfast and brunch dishes. The dining room features sleek and elegant decor, although tables are a bit cramped; the outdoor patio is great during the summer months. Though other restaurants definitely offer more creative fare, this place serves as a dependable option for upscale dining in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Its a Mark McEwan restaurant so it has to be good. I came here for summerlicious (3 courses for $48) and the food and service here was exceptional. Modern Canadian fine dining at its best! The meal started with bread, there was whole wheat, white and olive loaf. I had the spicy tuna tartare, braised beef cheek, and tiramisu. The spicy tuna tartare had crispy sushi rice cakes on the bottom with a avocado cream, kabayaki sauce, nori and pickled ginger. Salmon was very fresh, it reminded me of poke. A umami and salty mix of soft, and crunchy textures. Braised beef cheek comes with a horseradish puree, pickled garlic, shallots, sautéed spinach, baby greens, a potato chip on top and a sauce of its natural jus. This dish is rich in beef flavour, and the pickled garlic and shallots contrasts the richness very well. The Tiramisu was in a deconstructed form. It comes in a cup with ladyfinger pieces, espresso powder, and caramel brittle on a layer of custard. Sweet and smooth finish to a fantastic meal. All the dishes had a multitude of flavours and textures that really complimented each other.  Everything here was a journey in itself. Will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Excellent food ! Always consistent. Waiters friendly and knowledgable :) I highly recommend it :)) grilled octopus salad is my favourite dish;)"}
{"text":"Apparently Justin Bieber stays in the hotel part of this trendy Yorkville building, and the bar part serves $19 cocktails and you sit next to an inebriated yet entertaining accountant in a pastel suit and beige fedora and he says his clients are gangsters but he wouldn't tell you if he was a gangster he'd probably just say he was an accountant, and there's a portly old man in orange pants sitting against the wall all alone moping into his brown drink on the rocks."}
{"text":"A spectacular bar from both section and service. A well trained and managed staff with a comprehensive knowledge of the wine, drink and food list. Friendly and professional. The restaurant was nothing shy of perfection. A broad menu with no glitches in service or taste. A destination rather than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Very upscale environment. Came here with work and it was quite the experience. The place is very decorative and is a spot that I would recommend for special occasions. We had a prix fixed menu. Pretty pricey for the quantity of foos"}
{"text":"We had lunch here during our stay at the Hazelton. Normally we avoid hotel restaurants but this one we did not.  First class service, excellent specials for lunch, loved the ambience.  It's not cheap but worth all they charge."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Review  Delicious Vegetarian options and very accommodating.   I'm surprised One does not have higher reviews. It is on the expensive side and the clientele is generally high brow, pretentious types.   I've been to the restaurant for personal and work related dinners. The staff is polite and nice and help neutralize the general douche baggery in the lounge.   The food is always great both in the restaurant and catering for larger groups. We just did an event at the Hazelton. I think they are connected with ONE. The Food was incredible."}
{"text":"This morning had the BLT for breakfast and I must say was blown away by it. Bacon strips in it was plentiful and delicious! I especially enjoyed the garlic aioli that came with it on the side. The staff also were courteous and fast. I'd definitely go back to tryout other dishes."}
{"text":"Quick warning: there's currently some construction on Yorkville ave that's blocking access to this restaurant however, if you go around the block, you can arrive on the other side.   Now, back to the review: with the reservations that we booked we were able to be seated on the patio which is so adorable and they sat us towards the back which was on a quiet street.   It started with ordering The Six which was the perfect amount of Tromba to warm up any part of me that would start to get cold with the sun going down and being offered individual servings of warm bread which was delish (despite not believing in taking more than one piece of bread, they return throughout the night to offer you as much as you'd like).   Summerlicious was going on while we were there so we utilized the menu. The tuna tacos were so nice and I got the sea bass as my entree. Typically I preferred the skin to be removed from my fish however, I did my best to remove it myself and it was very light and flavourful. The flourless chocolate cake and champagne was the perfect way to end the dinner.   I obviously couldn't resist looking at the regular menu - I loved the drink menu. Tons of options from wine, to cocktails to various liqueurs. The food menu was pretty substantial - especially for a higher end restaurant. There's something for everyone here!"}
{"text":"Coming here, I knew getting a vegan meal would be difficult. Especially judging by the very meat heavy menu. However, the food I had was awesome! I asked for the king oyster mushrooms, as well as the spiced eggplant and informed my server I'm a vegan. She was very accommodating, and remembered thing so even forgot to mention! I had a martini and she actually got me regular olives instead of the blue cheese olives they usually come with! I was very impressed by the overall experience. My mushrooms were so delicious and the presentation of everything was really beautiful. For a non-vegan friendly looking meal, I highly enjoyed my food! Of course it is very over priced-but that is to be expected in yorkville."}
{"text":"I'm not in a habit of handing out 5-stars. This ONE place will have a special place in  my tummy as I'm sure to return to try their many different menu offerings.   I would have to say, everything is excellent and you can't go wrong with anything.   The service we received was excellent! There is absolutely no reason to not try if you haven't been and every reason to return. I hope you will have the same experience as my family and I."}
{"text":"Came here with colleagues for a Monday evening dinner on the patio with the expectation of sharing a decent meal after a long day at work, but that was not how it all worked out. We arrived a bit early for our reservation but they had our table ready so a few of us sat and ordered drinks and appetizers while we waited for the rest of the group. Drinks came out incredibly slow, when our server remembered that we ordered drinks - as there was at least one that was completely forgotten (though, it did show up on the bill). They also ran out of bitters at one point, which we found out 15 minutes after my friend ordered an Old Fashioned, and it was another while before the new drink was delivered. The food was good, but the order was messed up - an entree was ordered but an appetizer was delivered instead. At this point we did not want to wait for more food to be made given the slow pace of the service so we ate what was delivered to us.   The worst part was that after all this, the server didn't even really seem to care - no apology, nothing removed from the bill (until we asked to have the drink that wasn't delivered removed), and when it came time to pay, the credit card machine froze at the table. I was charged, and gave them my information to send me the receipt (as it was a work dinner that I needed the receipt to expense) and I never heard back from them with said receipt. I did however, receive a second charge for the same amount, which I've disputed and had removed by Amex thankfully. Luckily, the group had a good sense of humor about the whole thing, but I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for any sort of decent service."}
{"text":"My fiance took me here to propose to me the day before Valentine's Day so I will forever love One Restaurant for this very reason.   In terms of the restaurant itself, I thought the atmosphere was beautiful, cozy and warm.   The service was great. To be honest, the bread boys were the most pleasant- so polite and just had such a kind demeanour. The waiter we had was polite and to the point. He gave us our privacy, which is what my fiance prefers when we go out and eat; less talk, more food. For me, I like a little conversation from the waiter. For some reason it bummed me out that he didn't ask if we were here for a special occasion or not. I go to the Keg often and they ALWAYS ask if I'm celebrating or just having a nice dinner out. That's just my personal preference though and I'm not docking any points.   The food was DELICIOUS. The steak was moist and succulent. Perfectly cooked- just the way we asked. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and tasty.   Lobster spoons were so so good. Creamy, buttery and flavourful.   The mango sorbet was yummy and the fruit toppings were fresh.   We had other delicious things too that I can't remember exactly what we had but all I know is I left very full and very happy.    The only reason I docked one star is because the manager came out to talk to a couple that obviously frequents the restaurant. She talked to them for a very long time, quite loudly. It didn't really bother me because I think loyal customers should be treated well! Plus, their conversation was kind of funny and cute. What bothered me is that she ignored everyone sitting around the couple's table and didn't even bother to say 'Good evening. How is your meal?'. Considering One Restaurant is a fine dining restaurant, I have a higher expectation of management. It just made my fiance and I feel unwelcome at a place we were visiting for the first time.   If the manager is coming out to say hello to regular, he/she should also come around to tables to say 'Hello' to new patrons as well.   I will definitely be coming again to try the lunch menu though."}
{"text":"I had a totally different experience that the other Yelpers.   I had an excellent meal and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I started with a tasty glass of temperanillo and looked over the menu.  I ordered the black cod, which was cooked to perfection and a side of the broccoli.  It was absolutely excellent.  The service was a bit over the top for my liking but it was a bit distant.    I had a delightful evening and would come back for a good healthy meal."}
{"text":"I came here because I read in Food & Wine about how Marc McEwan is considered by them to be one of the top rising chefs anywhere. So my latest trip to Toronto had to include a stop here. Went here for breakfast and was not disappointed. For starters, they had various copies of the daily newspapers at the bar for your reading pleasure. So I grabbed one of each (media whore that I am) and started sampling the menu. I thought about having one of the Isobolic Protein Shakes but instead opted for some fine coffee and the exquisite chocolate brioche french toast. Would've liked a little more chocolate impact but that's me. I'm a chocoholic, no doubt. Hours are very good here and they're open very late with a late night menu. Would've enjoyed coming here for dinner or the late night menu but it wasn't in the cards for this trip. Still, I can't wait to come back and try the burgers and frites."}
{"text":"Came here to eat brunch with coworkers without realizing it was such a nice place. I had their egg white omelette (they let you choose the ingredients). Their fresh juice was amazing! However, it was quite pricey for the food that we had. Also, we were seated outside and it started raining on us! They didn't hurry to put up the umbrellas for us; they kind of just let us sit in the rain until we said something, which I thought was odd."}
{"text":"Great looking bar and restaurant.  The bar is worth the visit if for no other reason than to watch the scenes going on.  Prices are not for the weak."}
{"text":"This scenester bar/restaurant is attached to the ritzy Hazelton Hotel in Yorkville (the equivalent of Beverly Hills). We always end up wandering over here because some of our friends frequent the place and the cocktails are actually quite good. It's very dark inside. There's a lovely patio outside in the summertime (when it's actually a good deal more pleasant). Service is good and there's always rumblings of the rich and chamous. Shaq had a party here during the NBA All Star weekend and apparently U2 has rented out and closed down the place before. I've heard it's all the buzz during TIFF. A place to see and be seen. Dress appropriately."}
{"text":"We went on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The patio was nice and service was alright, the jerk chicken was dry and nothing special. The eggs benny was apparently pretty good according to my boyfriend. Might come back...but then there are other options so why wouldn't I try somewhere new and surprise myself."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not what it used to be. It used to be the place to offer the best service at decent prices (for Yorkville). There is no service at all. The waiters think they are more important than the customers filling your time with stories about themselves. When we asked the premium vodkas on the menu, the waiter replied, \"well we have everything\". Really? and you're in the service business? He couldn't be bothered to give us a hint on what \"everything\" meant. Drinks took forever, food took forever. We moved our seat 3 times and finally ended on the patio where the service got worse desptie being empty. The waitress cared nothing about us, made no eye contact, only came to clear the plates and rush us off. Mark, you need to train your staff properly and take some tips from Scaramouche, where we spent 3 hours on Friday with the most low key, subtle, service oriented team of waiters. You could learn a lot!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a couple of cocktails and a dozen oysters with my mom on the patio following Toronto Fashion Week in Yorkville. How boujee!  When we initially sat down, we saw two fab ladies drinking a pink beverage out of champagne flutes. We asked our waiter what the drinks were and he stated they weren't on the menu - so of course we ordered two! Tip : ask for a flute of champagne with a shot of vodka and muddled raspberries - just delightful!  We enjoyed sitting on the patio people watching and sipping our off menu cocktails.  A gentleman came around as we were sipping our drinks and offered us some amazing house made bread with butter - so good! Everything was lovely however one of our oysters had a bit of sandy grit in it. My mom mentioned it to a server who was walking by - she was very apologetic and lovely then brought out two other ones to replace it.  Definitely would return again!"}
{"text":"I work in the neighbourhood but I've never had lunch/dinner here.  A coworker and I went to One for Winterlicious b/c the menu looked very good (and a bargain at $28!).    First - a bread guy came around with some different option.  We opted for a bread that I think had onion and other veg baked in and it was incredible.  I mean, bread?  But it was so good.  We flagged that guy down a couple of times.    App - I had the roasted tomato soup and my companion had the pork belly.  Both were lovely.  The soup was basic, but excellent.  Drizzled with (I think) basil oil and served with a grilled cheese crouton.  Pork belly was saucy and served on a bed of delicious.    Main - I had the brown butter squash ravioli (with pine nut brittle, cream, crispy sage).  I was taken aback that it was simply 3 ravioli.  However, one bite clued me in to why.  This dish is heavy, but not in a bad way.  It's sweet and interesting and I was satisfied after three pieces.  My companion had the trout, which she raved about.  I don't eat fish, but I watch a lot of food network (lol) and the trout was cooked to perfection.  Dessert - I had the apple tart and it was incredible.  The cinnamon ice cream really put it over the top.  My companion had the chocolate cake which was just so-so for me.  The coffee 'sauce' on the side was the best part.  Anyway - overall a great experience and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food -- it was delicious! I mean, compared to other restaurants I've visited in Toronto, this one's got the 5*  Ambiance -- absolutely gorgeous and quiet. Professional. There weren't a lot of people when we were there, so that might have been the reason why it was quiet. However, there was a full bar right next to us and I was surprised that I couldn't hear the noises.  Service -- the servers were so accommodating! A bit slow though, I wish they kept one so we could easily call them when we need them. But they were here and there once in a while so that was okay."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving dinner ... my daughter and I were really looking forward to a special meal together. The special menu was very appealing. Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing. The meal was tasty enough and the service was fine but nothing stood out or made it memorable. I found the atmosphere a bit stuffy and the pony skin on the walls was a curious choice.  There were no candles or flowers on the tables that would suggest a special occasion. My daughter enjoyed her $20 cocktail but my Prosecco was slightly warm and somewhat flat. The restaurant was nowhere near full, yet the wait staff wasn't attentive. The bill was steep and that makes up my mind... I would not go back."}
{"text":"In terms of consistency of both food and service, One really is at the top of my list.  (Morton's is perhaps similar, but I have a personal preference for modern cuisine over steakhouse fare).  On my most recent visit I was impressed by the rhubarb and goat cheese dessert.  I was a little skeptical given the odd description, but was pleasantly surprised once it arrived.  Flavors, textures, and quantities were successfully balanced, and the presentation involved a creative geometric arrangement.   Most unfortunately, they tend to change their desserts every season, so if you go now it may be unavailable!  Henceforth, I will update this review each time I visit!"}
{"text":"It is my go to place every time I have a visitor (at least during summer) in Toronto. Been here couple of times for lunch and drinks in the evening. They have a huge selection for food and drinks and did not have anything here that I was not satisfied. Waiters and hostess are friendly and attentive. The patio is such a great place to spend an afternoon or evening. It gets crowded during summer evenings so try to make reservation especially for big groups. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely outstanding, and the service was better than any place I've been before. The perfect wine pairings were suggested for our courses, and everything tasted delicious. It's a pricey spot, so if you are on a budget, save it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Relaxing and inviting indoor space with inventive cocktails, gastropub munchies and a variety of beers on tap served by beautiful women in black cocktail dresses with style and attitude. Sure the prices are astronomic, but you get the experience that you pay for."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious, $28 for a 3 courses meal which is exceptional value! I would recommend anyone to go there during winterlicious. Food was decent, for the price of this place, I expect more from them tho.   If you are not going during winterlicious, it's very expensive, unless you are making tons of money. Well its fine dining in a really nice high class restaurant.  However at the end of the day, for that kind of price range there's a lot of better places out there for better food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. Dined here a long time ago....like Summerlicious 2014 and for a media dinner. It has a great atmosphere for people watching. Lots of professional people come here to lunch, so you are likely to spot someone you recognize if business/politics are your interest. During summer and TIFF, the patio is the favoured spot too.   It's quite pricy though, so only come if you are comfortable dropping some $$$ or maybe check them out for Winterlicous since that's coming up soon. More affordable.   I won't recommend specific dishes, since their menu changes and as previously mentioned..I haven't been back in a while. I do remember liking their fish and salad dishes though. But check out some pics I have posted if curious.   Overall, if you want to go fancy and splurge. One wouldn't be a bad pick. Nice resto."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner here New Year's eve. Very expensive but worth it. A very fine steak, all by itself on the plate with mushrooms and frites as expensive extras. Fine chicken tacos, eggplant arrabiata, and Gravlax apps, and a beautiful warm chocolate cake for dessert. Service was good--if anything a bit too efficient.   We stayed overnight at Hazelton Hotel which was superb."}
{"text":"Dined here on Feb. 21, 2015 for my Wedding Anniversary with my wife and we had more than a great dinner; a rich and memorable experience. We opted for cocktails in the lounge upon arrival and enjoyed very delicious concoctions ( mine made with cognac.. Yum!) and we were also treated very well be the front door host team.  Dinner was a cut above. Exceptional. We were even given the opportunity to meet the new Chef de Cuisine, who came out to check on us and see if we were having a good Anniversary! What a special treat! Highlights from our three course meal included:  -Oysters: simple, clean, effective with great sauces to employ.  -Lobster Spoons!!!! Great buttery taste, super soft (not chewy) texture.  -CDN Prime Ribeye!! Succulent, perfectly grilled to MR, even the fat was delicious because we ate the whole thing. Cheers to the cook who executed this delicious steak.  The server and Maitre 'd were very pleasant and the Maitre 'd helped us select a killer bottle of Sonoma Cabernet to compliment our meal. Prices are on the higher side, but for a special occasion, this place was definitely worth every penny. Highly recommended for romantic dinners, business/client evenings, or family suppers.   BRAVO!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT spot if you want someone to feel special.  After walking by this fancy-ish spot many times, I was treated to a birthday brunch here. Staff was fantastic - friendly but formal, same with the entire experience. We were seated on the patio, and the entire service was flawless - I had the ricotta pancakes & my sidekick had the chicken & waffles. Both were delicious, I was not disappointed!  This place has a somewhat lavish reputation, and the staff and ambiance of even the patio definitely make you feel like a star. The patio is filled with champagne bottles and oversized sunglasses, but staff is superb at making even the most novice Yorkville-ite feel welcome and important.  Great experience if you want to spoil someone and are feeling fancy. Prices are decent for the experience ($65 for a Saturday brunch - that included drinks)."}
{"text":"Enjoy the food and the place was very nice but a bit overpriced. Overall it was a good experience. I loved their bread!!"}
{"text":"The sun was shining, the birds were chirping and the best dressed people in Toronto were eating delicious looking food so we decided to sit down as well. What attracted us here was the beautifully manicured outside patio area. They have space heaters in case it is too chilly but in the sun there were no problems.   We weren't hungry for dinner so we ordered snacks. I had the foie gras 2 ways on toast and I was incredibly impressed. It came out as 3 bite size pieces of bread with ice cream scoop dollops of creamy melt in your mouth foie gras on top. It almost had a sweet taste as if honey and balsamic had been snuck in some how. The bread had a slight crunch without being too thick. Overall the best foie gras I have ever had.   We then had a bottle of wine which we were delighted to find out was actually a liter and thus a little bigger than a normal Bottle.   My wife had the white chocolate ice cream and she loved it. Perfect snack on a hot day. The service was fantastic and the only downside is that we weren't hungry enough to order more.  Absolutely everything on the menu looked fantastic, and even though the prices are steep, based on the creativity of the menu, the restaurants location, and the taste of the food we had, i wouldn't hesitate to spend good money on a full dinner."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday just past midnight. Very dead and very very rude, full of attitude.. it's a hotel bar but supposedly they can do their last call at 12.30 and then they call their clients lucky to be served! I have never been anywhere with so much attitude.. Absolutely terrible service!"}
{"text":"2 pints,1 martini, 1 glass of wine, 3 sliders. $100 plus tax and tip.  None of it was anything special."}
{"text":"Fantastic patio and lovely service. Although quite pricey it wasn't pretentious. Had a cold beer and a good book. The dressing on my garden salad was amazing. Great place for an anniversary dinner or special occasion."}
{"text":"Been here twice for brunch recently....sat on the patio both times. And both times I was somewhat underwhelmed by the food (eggs benedict, omelette, etc).  If the weather is nice, the best part about One is the location. Sit outside and watch all the smartly dressed Yorkville beauties pass by.  But if you're looking for a mind-blowing, lip-smacking brunch, this just isn't it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was impeccable, and the restaurant itself was spacious and classy. However, pricing needs some work, still too much buck for your bang, so to speak."}
{"text":"Omg, the best ravioli I have ever had in my life. Landed up here with work colleagues. I was highly impressed with the service and food. Presentation was great and very tasty. Everyone in the party loved their food. Cream corn and prawns also excellent!"}
{"text":"The family and I dined here last night for New Years Eve and we got the private dining room. The ambiance was amazing and the staff was really friendly and helpful. The private dining was a wonderful choice as it fit all nine of our family members and it was comfortable. The food was simply to die for. For appetizers, we had fried calamari and the lobster For the main course, I went for the tenderloin, medium well, and I never dined here before, so I thought the sides came WITH the main dish. But, apparently not. The mashed potatoes, mushrooms, baked potato came in big servings for everyone to share. For dessert, we had the creme brulee and oh my Lord, it was too good.  I would definitely suggest this restaurant to my friends and family and I would definitely come back once again!"}
{"text":"For that price range, you're really paying for the ambience and location instead of the food.  Service was impeccable as well. Came without reservations, but arrived in a Ferrari and valet parked. They seated us right away in a nice table facing the street. Excellent choices for wine and cocktails, attentive service but as for food?  I ordered fresh oysters, foie gras-classic dishes for nice restaurant but I don't remember them being really good at all. It's a beautiful restaurant I must say. I went back for drinks another night and ambience was nice as well. But in terms of food-it's really so so."}
{"text":"One. Singular sensation... every little bite she takes...  I travel across the country and over the border to find myself in one of Toronto's \"see and be seen\" power lunch hot spots that took me back to the glam of Los Angeles. While not my scene in tinsletown, I loved every minute of this Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) leisurely lunch hot spot. ONE Restaurant in the Hazelton Hotel is every bit as swanky as LA, with Toronto charm, Canadawood glamour and fab.u.lous fare.  I could have left completely satisfied and impressed with just the bread they served. The bread man, who I secretly wished would be my bff, glided around the restaurant with freshly baked sourdough, whole wheat and olive bread. The bread was so light, so fluffy, so warm. Heavenly. You can always tell a restaurant by the quality of their bread and I knew I was in for a real treat at ONE after devouring four pieces (blush).  A favorite of Torontonians, it seems, is block cod. The fish was so tender, so buttery, it melted in my mouth. It was complemented with enoki mushrooms and yuzu sauce, which were a perfectly refreshing pairing.  The fries with truffle oil and parmesan? Addicting. The best part was that the parmesan wasn't just sprinkled on top of the tall vase the fries were nestled in. It was drizzled throughout the layers of luscious fries so you got a little in every bite.  Our waitress was overly pleasant, had an incredible sense of humor and swooped in and out at the perfect times.  One of my favorite things? They have tiny stools at each table for women's purses so they can perch on there, not on the floor. Love it!  Once was not enough at ONE. Can't wait for trip number two!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! I ate Perogis (potatoes ravioli with cheese and salmon) and broccoli, everything was good (I suggest to try them). The location was really quite! A little bit expensive but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating space - probably one of the better locations in Yorkville.  Interesting cocktails - the avocado margarita was great, a bit on the heavier side for a cocktail but still refreshing. Tuna tartar wasn't anything special, the lobster spoons looked amazing though.   Was there on a Wednesday around 6 no problem getting a seat or racking up a $50 bill on one app and a drink. high price tag for this place - typical for the area."}
{"text":"My linguine entree was soggy and buttery in taste. Very disappointed to pay so much for this entree."}
{"text":"We booked reservation online for Sat summerlicious lunch.  They called us asking if we are doing summerlicious because they do not offer summerlicious on the weekend.  We were surprise because I thought they were suppose to offer summerlicious menu for the time the summerlicious is running.  No apologies at all.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to \"One\" restaurant because Mark McEwan is the owner. We had Dover Sole, Truffle Chicken Supreme. Bacon Pork Chop, 5oz Terderloin with bone marrow & Beef Short Ribs as well as the Lobster spoons, Crispy chicken tacos. For dessert we had the outstanding Boston creme donuts. The service & ambience are excellent. Go & enjoy."}
{"text":"Located in what is now the very heart of the upscale neighborhood of Yorkville right on the corner of Yorkville and Hazelton with an outside patio, you couldn't ask for better seating in a better or more pleasant area.  At the recommendation of my server, a delight person and top properly attired professional, I ordered their special grilled chicken breast sandwich of the day along with a side salad with creamy Caesar dressing. When served, it came upon a round cutting board. The chicken was totally moist, had been hand hammered to a tenderness and folded in with a delightful tasting cheese. The bread likewise was fresh, full of flavor, having been nicely grilled. Indeed one best, most tasty grilled chicken sandwiches I've ever had.   While there I also availed myself to take a look at their immaculate interior dining area and the use of their restroom facilities. Everything about them were perfect in setting, rather elegant in appearance and above all spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"I went to this place the first time with my friend for dinner tonight and the experience was not the best. First, the plates were not clean. There were dry residues stick to it. Secondly, we ordered jerk chicken (half chicken) and it was undone when first served. So they took the chicken to cook more. And when they brought back the chicken, the chicken was divided into three pieces and the thigh was gone, only the drumstick left. Maybe they ate it I don't know. Lastly, when the waiter took the plates when we finished, he spilt water from the plate on my friends. The food was just ok. And it's definitely overpriced. And it's obviously overrated on opentable. Will not return."}
{"text":"Summer time is amazing. The seafood dishes are good, especially the cod."}
{"text":"Just had the worst restaurant experience at One. Came here for lunch expecting a nice meal and great service judging by all the good reviews. It started out fine, we were seated and were offered drinks etc. I ordered the steak salad and my partner ordered the chicken tacos. What a disappointment. Both were very uninspiring and average, my salad was basically a guacamole salad with a couple tortilla chips sitting on top of half of an iceberg lettuce. The steak had a really sweet sauce on it which didn't match the dish and of course ruined the steak. There was nothing special about the tacos my partner ordered. All of this could have been solved by a simple quality check from our server. He stopped by a couple times to fill up our waters but never bothered to do his job and ask if everything was good. A couple minutes later we asked for the bill from another server who asked if we were finished eating, to which we responded yes, and he took the plates away.  Why did no one think to ask if the food was okay if I didn't even eat half of it?  So then our waiter strolls by shortly after and tosses the bill on our table. Didn't say thank you, still no quality check, and didn't even look at us. Service like this is inexcusable. Even if you're having a bad day you can still fake it and at least smile and say thank you. Good luck to you guys if this is the kind of staff you hire."}
{"text":"Took my old lady here for her birthday which happened to fall on the first fridya of TIFF.  I called a week ahead to make reservations for 2 and the hostess said that the book was wide open and it wasn't a problem but because it was TIFF the events planned would have to get back to me to confirm.  After days of calling I fianlyl had my reservation confirmed 4 hours before I was supposed to have dinner.  Not the best start to this dinner.  Got there - nice place but not as nice as bymark, not even close.  and i would say the same for the food.  the truflle fries were amazing.  the dill creamed corn was fantastic.  the scallops were gritty and forgettable and the short rib was pretty good, not great.  The sundae for dessert was pretty bad - would have rather gone to Dairy Queen for a banana split.  And the food ain't cheap.   Service was top notch however.  As it was TIFF it was pretty cool to be seated 3 tables down from Anthony Hopkins and I could see Minnie Driver on the patio, but really that wasn't what I was there for.    If you want a great gastronomic experience I would avoid One.  If you want to hang out in Yorkville and have money to burn I guess it is a pretty good option."}
{"text":"We came for dinner as a group of four during Summerlicious (3 courses, $48). The meal started with a bread server coming around with a big board from which you can choose 1 of 3 different types of bread. Was definitely a nice way to start the meal and something you don't see very often. I had the salad to start - tomato, burrata, and watermelon which was a great combination but a small portion and the tomatoes were not super fresh. As a main I had trout with falafel and mint sauce. It was a decent portion and really good - perfectly cooked fish and a great combination of flavours. For dessert I tried the matcha-strawberry shortcake which was good but a little dry. Service was decent, although I remember asking for more bread and it took awhile to come.    For the price we paid I was happy enough but definitely not worth coming here and paying full price. I've heard this patio is 'the place to be seen' in Yorkville so maybe the restaurant is popular based on its location, rather than the food. I'm glad I tried it but probably won't bother going back."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend after the symphony as it was close by.  It was a Wednesday night. Lovely patio with heaters and so great for people watching. I had a Sapporo ($10).  My friend had a white wine which she said was delicioius ($14)  I had some fries and onion rings as I just wanted a snack cos it was quite late. The staff were very friendly and the service was quick.  The only downside to this place is it is expensive.  It is over priced even by Yorkville standards.  It's hard to judge the food based on fries and onion rings.  I would return here however and give it another go. Nice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this restaurant has only two stars - I was in raptures over the food at One. I came here for a late dinner during a recent business trip to Toronto - it was one of the few restaurants near my hotel that was still open and serving from their full dinner menu at 10pm. I ordered the spaghetti with Sicilian meatball and it turned out to be one of the best spaghetti dishes I've ever had - flavorful and a little spicy. The presentation was excellent as well. For dessert, I couldn't resist trying the peanut butter and dark chocolate tart which came with a small scoop of grape mousse on top of a hazelnut croquant. Every bite of that tart disappeared within minutes, it was so rich and smooth.  This place definitely isn't cheap, but I was so satisfied with everything  that I consider what I paid worth the price. In addition, the restaurant itself is beautiful, with a lovely outdoor patio that's perfect for warm summer nights. If I lived in Toronto, I'd definitely be visiting One much more often!"}
{"text":"3.5 I came here for my anniversary dinner during Winterlicious. I can't say it was the best food I've had but ONE was great for a special occasion. One restaurant's dining experience screams luxury (duh...it's Yorkville), they take care of details you don't expect that makes the dining experience special: complimentary coat check, a personal chair for your purse and a \"Happy Anniversary\" script on our desserts because I tapped that extra button on OpenTable. Service was generally quite attentive, but I do find it hard to locate our server when it got busy.  Maybe because of Winterlicious, dishes run small and I was not super filled at the end of 3 courses. I felt the mains plating could have been better, since they lacked the finesse you'd see in a restaurant of that caliber. Only the \"bacon and eggs\" app blew us away with a wonderful marriage of mellowness from the egg component and bold flavours from the \"bacon\" and onions (dish not on regular menu). Everything else was a bit of a blur after a couple of days so I felt the food left so much more to be desired. I also felt slightly uncomfortable dining here, since the restaurant seemed filled with business executives and the wealthy. I wouldn't say there was anything from the service that actively contributed to this. We received equally as good service but even when we dressed well, ordered alcohol/items outside of the licious menu, tipped well, overall atmosphere felt unwelcoming and pretentious even compared to restaurants in the Financial district."}
{"text":"They have a horrible waiter there who acts and looks like he should be working at a pub on Queen Street. He has a blond or red beard and is such a loser. I go to One almost 4 times a month and will request someone else if he comes to my table to serve us. I ordered a new burger that was on the menu and it was falling apart like no tomorrow. I never had such bad service in my life. I am uncertain why they don't train there servers better."}
{"text":"Boy for the location and price, the services here SUCKED.  Food is overpriced for the service you get.  Food itself is not bad.  We were meeting friends here.  6 of us for dinner followed by about 25 people for drinks.  Our server during dinner was really not attentive at all.  The server for drinks later had some real attitude.  Instead of asking everyone for their credit card to keep the tab open and everything organized, she decided to put everything on one bill and have everyone pay for their portion.  When requested, she had some attitude.  Lady, working in an establishment like this, you gotta be professional; you turned out to be a food and probably lost a lot in tips."}
{"text":"I have visited One Restaurant many times and it has never disappointed. The food is fabulous and the service is equally as amazing as the five-star hotel that it is connected too (the Hazelton). The patio is definitely one of the best in the city when the weather is nice, but the decor of the interior of the restaurant is both classy and trendy. Sooooooofabooooosh! The best restaurant in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Contrary to some of the reviews here, I thought the food was absolutely excellent. Went there during the week and it was not overly crowded and service was prompt. I have been there for cocktails in the summer on the weekend and it gets a bit crowded with overly pretentious people."}
{"text":"Traveling for business, I eat out everyday. Sometimes I have an amazing dinner at an upscale restaurant and sometimes my amazing dinner is at a small non-assuming, beautiful little hidden gem. I have frequented this restaurant in Yorkville, Toronto MANY times and know now that I would NEVER return to this restaurant unless was obligated to with a work group of people. The meatballs were disgusting, the foie gras crostini too sweet and the Lobster spoons cold. Please see my photo of chewy fat in the meatball. The people sitting in the bar next to me were the most unpleasant people SO FULL OF THEMSELVES. All they did was talk about and ridicule people. The man next to me was named Paul and his Gf was obviously 50 years younger. I thought that only happened in Vegas or LA....  My bartender apparently forgot about me because these douche bags arrived. I guess he doesn't need a 40% gratuity. My bar neighbors were so ugly, so entitled. I am from LA and could not even stand listening to their conversation. They were so disrespectful of ALL people and only loved themselves. They are obviously racist and had comments about every race, Asian, Mexican, Anerican and Blacks alike. What a disappointment. The food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"A friend chose this place for a Summerlicious dinner catchup date, and I remember saying to her at least twice, \"Good choice!\"  They had an outdoor patio option which I opted out of, since the clouds were threatening to break open.  Walking into the Hazelton Hotel (where ONE was located) lobby, I was a little blinded by the darkness but impressed nonetheless by the spaciousness and cool decor.  It was a bit of an early dinner so the tables were mostly empty; we were seated at a nice table by the window, where we could somewhat see the patio diners through mesh curtains.  Onto the food -- I decided to go with a Corn & Crab Chowder, Boneless Pork Rack, and Chocolate Cheesecake for my three courses.  My friend chose Pork Belly, Eggplant Parmesan, and Ontario Fruit Crumble.    I wish I got the pork belly too -- but didn't, since I was already having a pork entree -- because it was AMAZING!  She shared a bite with me and it was literally melt-in-your-mouth marinated.  The first impression I had was how flavourful everything was - the avocado puree, yuzu, etc. all had really strong flavours (bordering on overwhelming, but managed to stay delicious).  My chowder came in a white bowl as a clump of corn and assorted bits on the bottom; both of us were staring confusedly at this tiny portion, until the server conjured up a kettle of warm soup that he poured into the bowl.  Too bad I didn't get to record this transformation happening - it was so unexpected.  My pork entree was a little disappointing; I don't remember much about it, maybe because I was so blown away by how great my friend's eggplant tasted.  Personally, I dislike eggplant, and am a little allergic.  I could not believe they could make eggplant taste so good!  The crispy coating added just the right amount of texture, and again everything was high in flavour.  Returning to my own dish, I barely managed to finish the pork and the asparagus since we were both already full.  Finishing up the meal were our desserts, which were less than spectacular.  She said the fruit crumble was not very good, and my chocolate cheesecake was just average.  It had a couple chunks of 'honey comb' (same hard candy as Crunchie bars) which I wasn't a fan of, and caramel sauce.  Overall a great dining experience though; still can't get over that pork belly even a week later.  I will most likely be returning sometime in the future! :)"}
{"text":"At first I was disappointed at a mediocre meal but I realized what kind of clientele this restaurant caters too. It Caters to people who have money but don't have developed palates. Similar to the Yorkville retail, money but no style. Peice of meat with Steak sauce on the side. Crème Brule the same way it was served 20 yrs ago, Really Now!. Sorry Marc I like your other restaurants."}
{"text":"Over the course of our 5-year friendship, bets/deals/gambles have been made and let me tell you, Denny is in the hole big time. These IOUs have been accumulating for some time and since I'm not in town all that often, they truly have become \"friendly\" bets. Do I ever see my ROI? Rarely. Maybe once.. 2-something years ago, mind you. For this trip, all these friendlies were forgotten. In fact, all I wanted to do was catch-up with an old friend.   Walking through Yorkville, the patio of One Restaurant looked so inviting on a warm sunny day, I was sold. Denny, however, was skeptical. He humoured me and agreed to what he now calls, a mediocre-at-best-I-told-you-so brunch. Le sigh.   One the menu:  Hers -- Strawberry Champagne His -- Fresh Orange Juice  Hers -- Eggs Benedict with artisan ham on brioche with Hollandaise on the side. His -- Pastrami Hash with poached eggs and herb Hollandaise.  The Eggs Benedict were okay. I asked for my eggs to be medium and they came overcooked. The Hollandaise was too thick for my liking and the ham wasn't anything all that special -- artisan or not. I enjoyed my miniature roast herb potatoes best. Denny's dish looked a little more appetizing and tasted great. Although, after bite #10, I can see why he was getting bored with his meal.  Shared -- Trio of Blueberry Sweets: Panna Cotta, Biscotti Crumble, Blueberry Honey Ice Cream, Frappe.   Loved the crumble and ice cream.. together, it was the perfect pairing. A solid panna cotta but I've had better. Total pass on the cough-syrup tasting frappe. Denny refused to try after my initial reaction of squeamishness.   Solo -- Cappucino. Good enough, though it was lukewarm. I like it hot.  Looking to split the bill, Denny decided to cover our fairly pricey brunch and my many menu items entirely. We're not yet even, but I would say close to, especially after my failed brunch suggestion.  The wait staff was very accommodating, friendly, and allowed us to stay for as long as we wished. It's a total shame the food wasn't better tasting.   Worth the $80+ tab? Not at all.  Will I return? Probably not.  Do I like the patio? Why yes, yes I do. Unfortunately, that might just be the only thing going for this place."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch and brunch cocktails. Very nice ambiance. Definitely a great place to go if you're tired of having brunch at greasy hole-in-the-wall type spots. I'm surprised to see such a low average for this place. It's delicious! Some of the grossest breakfast places I've been to have higher ratings than this place for some reason... I guess many Torontonians value crappy mediocre food over hoity toity atmospheres? This place rocks. Quit hating! This place is great for a quality brunch. Pricey but it's in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Location: You would be very hard pressed to find a location that can match and come close to the corner of Hazelton and Yorkville. It's a corner known by many in and out of the country as the place to park your Ferrari, Lamborghini, or Rolls. Attached the Hazelton Hotel, which bathrooms are submerged in natural stone and it doesn't take much to realize your in a very special place. Locale business magnates and worldwide celebrities eat here when they come to Toronto.  Location: Had to reiterate this point...thats how good the location is lol  Atmosphere: I haven't spent much time inside, i'm a patio person so i'm usually outside when i've gone to ONE but either or creates a nice setting for any occasion. There's money in the air, everyone is dressed to the nines (although here and there you'll come across the odd CEO with questionable company..which is fine and there business..but when she's wearing daisy dukes and hooker boots i have to wonder..is she not charging enough? lol)..The patio is a great place to be anytime during the summer, it's very lively at times, but can get filled up quickly.   Service: Depends on the day and time...For the most part i haven't had much to complain about however when it gets busy you could be waiting for a while..Do yourself a favour...order your main when you order your apps, and if your getting wine just get a bottle or two..it's better than having to wait..nothing is worse than trying to hail a waitress/waitor like a cab on a busy street.   Food: Everything i've had was really really good..prices are a bit high, but look where you are..It comes with the experience. I've had the 8oz tenderloin which i really liked, 8 oz is a bit small for me, i have a big appetite especially when i'm drinking wine. Some other dishes I've enjoyed are the butter chicken tacos, linguine, and i'm a huge smore fan so love their doughnuts :)))  Price: As mentioned before, you'll spend..for two people you'll be looking at around $200-250 in food...expect the same higher prices with wine as well.   Overall: If your thinking of going, just go! You'll have a good time..you'll spend more than usual most likely...but have a great time anyways. The experience is something you won't regret, don't look at the menu, keep your eyes on your date and enjoy his/her company with amazing food, a great atmosphere and the best patio in the city of Toronto."}
{"text":"The food was unexpectedly bad for a restaurant that should compete with the best restaurants in Toronto. The fish was mushy, mussels were soft and smelled fishy, spaghettini was overcooked. The octopus appetizer was tiny and soggy for $24. The service was good, which was the only plus and the room was beautiful which is why I give it two stars.Overall the food was a huge disappointment and worse than the last time that we had been here. I expect more from Mark McEwan."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, once on the patio during TIFF, the other inside during fall.  The service was good and the food very solid.  I will say the best thing I've ever had there was the Gluhwine...it was heaven in a glass!"}
{"text":"Are you so fucking cool? Do you like showing off? You have money to flaunt? You like trying unexceptionably hard? Like being a douche bag? Want a cougar girlfriend?   This is the place where you and your amazing awesome friends come for a night out on the town to watch people watch you while you're on the patio.  Overall, this place is full of pretentious pricks. Food is good and decently portioned but is slightly pricey for the quality. Drinks are good but you can usually buy 3 drinks elsewhere for the price of one here. Come here if you've got a ton of money to burn and less class than aunt suzie's ass. We should try to remember this people. Money does not buy class. It only buys expensive friends. Decor is nice, too bad a lot of plastic and pricks ruin it. Service is good though it is awfully hard to get the smell of douche bag out of my clothes after coming here. Save your money and go elsewhere. Anywhere."}
{"text":"One is pretty slick and sexy for a restaurant, afterall it is Yabu Pushelburg-ed to the hilt (is it just me or are those guys obssessed with squares & rectangles?) and no I'm not here at the Hazelton for some afternoon delight like them high rollin' executive types trolling for escorts, nah, I'm just here for an innocent b-day brunch.  The drink menu for brunch is outstanding with a good representation of champagne-y and sweet libations.  Considering that I'm a teetotaler, I was jonesing to sample every delectable cocktail. My DC's Susanne and Heather ordered the \"Marky Mark\" and the Lavender Mojito.  I settled for the Strawberry Elegance, the Hazelton Spritzer and the Honey Ginger Julep...triple fisting represent!!  What?? you're only 40 once right?  Yessir it's only 1pm and I'm already sauced!!  Good thing I wasn't sloshed enough to start dancing on tables, besides we'll leave that for the \"professional girlfriends\" who we're working it near the bar.   When the food arrived my companions breathed a chorus of oohs and ahhs.  I was just happy to start sobering up while stuffing my face with carbs.  My DC's ordered the Smoked Salmon Rosti and the Polenta with Smoked Duck respectively which both looked divine!  I got the Buttermilk pancakes with Rhubarb and Maple syrup with a side order of Frites and aioli.  While it wasn't the best tasting brunch I've ever had, it was the best SUGAR & ALCOHOL HIGH brunch everrrr.  Random tip: try to dine inside for lunch during patio season as there'll be less of the poseur riff-raff.  I know the patio is the place \"to see and be seen\" blah,blah, blah...but frankly watching plumped-up, duck lipped patrons trying to digest a salad along with seeing Euro-trash dudes wearing the trademark unbuttoned shirts with aggressively protruding chest hairs while the smell of stogies wafts in the air might put you off your food.    Overall I was ecstatically pleased (or maybe I was just pissed drunk) with the indulgent service and food and drink that One has to offer.  Yes indeedy, One is very pricey (drinks alone cost us over $100 yikes!!!) but given the posh surroundings, the dotting service and the designer food, and the amaaazing bevvies, I guess this is how the Yorkville rent is paid.  My friends got a good laugh out of my juiced alter-ego anyway :D"}
{"text":"It's hard not to feel that many of the previous reviewers were less reviewing the restaurant than reviewing expensive restaurants as a class  or expressing their own class antagonisms.  There's a perfectly good argument that says that ANY restaurant that costs more than $XX per person is a waste for you, and that's fine. That's usually my position as well.  Every so often it's fun to visit a restaurant proclaimed as \"great\" by the Foodie Class to see if there's something special going on.  All expensive restaurants are bound to attract wealthy jerks, but they're going in part because the place reflects their wealthy lifestyle.  There are few Yelp reviewers in this category and that's even more important to me.  Now, the food was excellent.  The lobster appetizer in butter and vermouth was delicious and the scallops with squash puree was wonderful.  The wine list DOES include modest-priced selections and I came away introduced to a new (to me) sauvignon blanc from Ontario that at $15.95 retail is better than some $25 wines from New Zealand (Mike Weir Vineyards).  I don't remember the specific dessert but it was delicious and they have a sophisticated understanding of tea.  The wait staff were genuinely friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was very comfortable.   Is it \"my kind of place\"? No offense to Mark McEwen, the food was great (I wasn't paying the bill) but for me visiting a restaurant that costs more than $40 per person - and you probably won't eat a full meal here with wine for less than $70 per person and it could easily be $100 - is an occasional luxury and not an everyday occurrence.  Would i go again when I'm in Toronto? Yes.  Would I go once a month if I lived in Toronto. No.  Maybe once a year. But it wouldn't be because the food was bad, the food was great."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!    We were fortunate enough to have a really nice server that made our fifth anniversary feel special!  Our evening started off with two complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate the occasion.  We're by no means drinkers but this was such a nice surprise and definitely appreciated.    We started our meal with the chicken tacos.  They were INCREDIBLE. By far the best chicken tacos I've ever had. Take note Taco Bell! lol   We also had the chicken noodle soup. Our server mentioned that it was a classic at the restaurant so we decided to give it a try. Growing up, eating our moms chicken soup was something we did often so this is probably not a fair comparison.  It was OK. Not great but by no means bad.   Our mains consisted of the BBQ short ribs and steak frites.  Both incredible tasty and tender. If you're getting the ribs, you probably don't need an additional side dish.  The portion was good and it was served with beans, coleslaw and cornbread.   The steak frites was nice as well. Portion was on the smaller side but you can't complain about a delicious steak!  Now on to the star of the evening...  truffle frites!  Holy cheap they were OUT OF THIS WORLD. I'd go back and just order these (and the chicken tacos). So tasty. So yum.  Yuuummmmmm!  No matter what you order, get the truffle frites!    We ordered the white chocolate cheesecake to end the meal. It was also nice.  The lemon was a bit overpowering but was also sexy delicious. They decorated the plate with a \"Happy Anniversary\".   Thanks for an amazing (and slightly expensive evening)!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant, the absolute best Cod fish in Toronto!!! Prices are high but it is worth every buck to go there, i have been going to this place for many years. I love the service. Location is great, downtown Yorkville."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. $$$$.  The art ladies who lunch.....we had a great time.  Attentive friendly staff.  My burger fell apart but was scrumptious.  We loved it!  Read the reviews  of people encountering obnoxious patrons.  These high end restos seem to attract these types.  Ignorant with money is the worst kind. Have eaten at the bar previously.  My friend and I were treated wonderfully."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful sunny afternoon on a Saturday and my friend had initially wanted Italian food in Yorkville but I was going there with my girlfriend later that night so we decided to walk around until we spotted another substitute. Lo' and behold when a plate of eggs benedict caught the corner of my eye at the lovely patio area and the decision was made.    Service: Not the greatest. Had we not asked for a shady seat, they would have seated us in a sunny spot. Also, the waiter took a very long time and no bread was served immediately. We had to wave him down to get our order taken. Get your shizz together please.  Food: I ordered the C r a b  B e n e d i c t which is what I came for anyway and I was not disappointed. There were chunks of crab meat under the perfectly poached egg, however the hollandaise sauce was a smidge too tangy for my taste. Still, for the price, I wouldn't be rushing back anytime soon.   My friend had the L o b s t e r  C a r b o n a r a which was definitely not worth the price. Although they had a good of lobster chunks, it wasn't anything to rave about.  Overall: You'll have to do better if you're competing for brunch."}
{"text":"I think One should take the title for \"best people watching\" restaurant in the city.   I was invited to dinner here on Friday night with some higher ups from work.   I have to put it out there immediately that the food really was 4.5-5 star rating. The service was very friendly - but as others mentioned, extremely extremely slow to bring out the food. I'm not sure if it's intentional or that there are issues in the kitchen, but either way - we sat down at 8:30pm, ordered the food by 9pm (first and second courses) and it took us until midnight to get out of there.   About 30 minutes after ordering, our table of ten was brought out some \"complimentary\" chartuterie plates. Now - these were lovely, but I feel positive that this was really just a decoy from the fact that our first courses were taking obscenely long to arrive.   We sampled some oysters (a big tray with 3 types - BC, PEI and Nova Scotian) all very delicious. And some lobster spoons (amazing) and some other bits and pieces.  I had the tuna sashimi appetizer which was absolutely the best. Each slice was served with a tiny ring of jalepeno cut across, which gave it a nice kick.  The black cod main courses was very, very small (4-5oz on a plate served with virtually nothing else except a bit of avocado sauce garnish). The other mains looked better (lobster carbonara, yum!) and a few people had steak and the red snapper. We had some shared sides at the table which were also all very lovely, fries, onion rings, brussel sprouts with bacon and some grilled beets.   Anyway, back to the people watching. There are some seriously weird and creepy people dining here. Ranging from 80 year old white haired men creeping at the bar, a table of 8 Italian mobsters with two ridiculously hot Asian call girls, and more fat titties than you can shake a stick at. The people in the bar on the way out looked quite cracked out to be honest. It's definitely not the posh upper class Yorkville-ites that you would imagine here, but some rare breeds of new money Euro types.  The weird people and the insanely long serving times definitely detracted from the experience.   The prices are exorbitant, but what do you expect? There are bottles of wine here priced at $500 that would cost $300 at any other fancy restaurant, according to the in-the-know colleagues I was dining with.  Overall. Very interesting."}
{"text":"Went to One with my boyfriend Friday night after a Jays game. The food was good- but a little bland. One thing that my bf and I couldn't get over was how rude the server that serves the bread was. He was so angry and seemed as though he hated life! It actually made us really uncomfortable at times. Service was so-so. Would come back for drinks/snacks, prob not dinner."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in Toronto. Have held some special occasion events here and every one has been amazing. If you want 5 star, look no further."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to come here for no particular occasion because he was tempted by the pictures on Instagram from this restaurant. I emailed the restaurant to make a reservation and since my friend wanted to have the food all on a wooden platter, I emailed the restaurant if they could make that arrangement. I had the pleasure to talk to Reilly for two weeks before the reservation upon our accommodation. I don't normally go to these places but it is a great place to try at least once. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful, lots of decoration.  We ordered: lobster spoons spicy tuna tartare steak frites classic sauce 5ox tenderloin mac & cheese sweet pea risotto  Everything was enjoyable but we felt that the mac & cheese and the risotto were our least favorites while the steak frites and lobster spoons were a hit! The complementary bread they give before the food were warm and delicious. Kim, our server, gave exceptional service as she kept coming back to ask if everything was ok."}
{"text":"The patio provided an excellent place to people watch while enjoying food and drink. The Cobb style salad was full of flavour and variety. The grilled chicken sandwich was tasty however the fries were soggy. Overall a nice place to sit and eat in Yorkville."}
{"text":"While the food was good here, the service left some to be desired.  Considering the price, I would have expected excellent food and service.  I tried the lobster spoons, which were outstanding.  The tenderloin steak was also quite nice, although it took them some time and a reminder to bring out the sauce.  The sides of frites, onion frites and mushrooms were quite nice - particularly the onion frites (like onion rings except much more tasty).    Overall, the food was quite good, but perhaps significantly overpriced.  The service was fairly slow.  Our main waiter was friendly and helpful, but the serving staff that was sent out to provide the food didn't quite know what to do.  Unfortunately, I feel this place is more about the show than the good restaurant."}
{"text":"What a depressing meal. It was really snowy out and the restaurant was *maybe* 1/4 full. Even still, the waiters just stood in a corner staring at empty plates and glassware.  Food was pretty poor compared to the other Mark McEwan restaurants to which I've been -- Bymark and North 44. I had a strip steak and a starter I can't remember. I do remember the meat was great but the steak had absolutely zero char on it. Not sure how that happens unless they did it sous-vide, but why would you cook a blue steak sous-vide instead of searing it in a pan for 3 minutes? I make better steak at home.  Fries are great, though.   I'll stick to Bymark, Splendido and Canoe for my high-end \"Canadian\" fix."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious 2015 and remember being the most excited for this place based on the menu and pictures I had seen, and in the end I was pleased with my choice. To start off with, the staff here were super super nice. I was horrifically late for my dinner and left my friend sitting by himself for about half an hour, but apparently the waitress was super nice to him and came around to check up on him a lot lol, and throughout our meal she was quite attentive and friendly and chatty with us.  For my meal, I had the scallop and pork belly to start. I LOVED the scallop and wished there was more than one, although it was a big one. The pork belly was good but a bit basic, it had Korean BBQ sauce on it and some avocado puree on the side, some napa, etc. kind of Asian-inspired. Good, but didn't really blow me away. That scallop though...  For my main, I ordered the short rib and thought the dish was well done, I liked the crispy onions on the top and thought they went well with the rib. The rib was wonderfully soft and tender, and I remember thinking this one was better than the one I had tried at La Societe the previous evening - perhaps the ingredients were just more interesting and the plating was more attractive.  I tried the citrus pavlova for dessert, having never had pavlova before. When it came out I thought it looked really nice, but unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan in the end - something about the texture of the pavlova didn't work for me. It was like crunchy on the outside but had a slightly chewy texture on the inside, it was sweet but in kind of an artificial, almost marshmallow-y way... perhaps just not my kind of dessert. It came with passionfruit sorbet and berries, and I remember thinking the passionfruit sorbet just didn't mix well with the pavlova - it added this extra bit of tartness and slight bitterness almost that just didn't work.   Everything was plated super nicely, with artistic little garnishes. I quite enjoyed my experience at this restaurant and might consider coming back if I happen to be in the area!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was because I was there for brunch...I fail to see the excitement about this restaurant based on our experience.  Now, for people watching in a ritzy section of Toronto, there is probably not a better address, but if you are interested in a well prepared flavorful meal with excellent service, I am pressed to go beyond a somewhat mediocre rating.  The setting is elegant.  But, during one of the hottest days that Toronto has witnessed in recent history, all the windows were wide open causing a patron behind us to complain, not infrequently about the air conditioning.  I did not find it unbearable, but thought that those who wanted fresh air were likely to have chosen the beautiful patio which was open.  I started breakfast with a grapefruit half.  Pretty standard fare here...no garnish, just a grapefruit  set within an indented plate.  This was followed by yogurt with granola.  The granola was very good...perhaps made in-house.  The French Toast  was lack luster although the menu indicated it was brioche bread.  The entire meal took almost two hours!  The servers did not come by very much.  In fact, our water glasses were never refilled.  Fortunately, we had ordered juice as well.  As we exited the restaurant, we passed  the server station where at least five waiters were engaging in some conversation.  That explained why they were unavailable for paying clients...  Perhaps things turn around at lunch & dinner...breakfast, unfortunately was somewhat of a bust."}
{"text":"\"It's hard not to feel that many of the previous reviewers were less reviewing the restaurant than reviewing expensive restaurants as a class  or expressing their own class antagonisms.\" Warren L.   This is the first time I've started a review with an epigraph but it was so well put and completely warranted. Sheesh. From the sound of these reviews, it seems like a revolt to the backdrop of Do You Hear The People Sing is just around the corner. Yeah, it's an expensive Mark McEwen helmed resto in the glitz district of Toronto. Yeah, drinks are expensive. And yeah, it's frequented by douchebags. But most comments here bespeak an irritance not with their food or drinks but with opulence and pretention; and while One sells the former pair, it didn't invent the latter. This is the same as shitting on the dollar store because it's \"cheap.\" You know?  ANYWAY, I sat at the bar for lunch and it was pretty good. The bartender was friendly, the douche-count low, and my noon-hour cocktail was pretty solid: a Maker's Bourbon Sour. For lunch I grabbed a pulled chicken sandwich with avocado. It was good, but a bit mushy like other experiences I have with avocado this month. The food certainly was expensive, so it's more for the expense-account crowd but the ambiance and service were pretty solid. I'd give it a try for dinner, or maybe stage my next proletarian meetup in their lounge.  Obligatory Title Pun: One more dawn/One more day/One day more!  Menu Readability: Lover-ly.  Need to mention: They have a great big patio.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'll take any excuse to talk about Jean Valjean."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious. The menu was okay but the desert was amazing. Picture perfect actually! I don't think I'd come back for summerlicious though. The portions were so small for a lot of $$$. Cool environment though. Thought maybe we'd run into \"The Real Housewives of Toronto\"!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during winterlicious.  Food was amazing.  Service was great but they were a bit cheap with the bread- but I didn't need the carbs.  Had the smoked trout, coq au vin and sticky toffee pudding.  All great dishes.   The restaurant filled up quickly and was quite noisy.  Very chic decor. Wait staff quite pleasant.  Will come back for summerlicious!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to my lunch at One today. Arrived and was seated at a lovely table on the patio. Then all went downhill from there. The bus boy while cleaning the table behind us spilled coffee all over my new dress and purse.  My chicken Tacos came out torched black.  And to top it off we asked for water which never came and our server was non existent. Thank goodness for the wonderful company and glorious day. Not even the bad experience could spoil that for us. What is all the fuss about Mark McEwan restaurants anyway. Total disappointment for me."}
{"text":"Nice upscale place, good vibe. Food takes way too long tho, we were starving so we had to keep asking for bread refill, it's annoying, they should've refilled when they saw it was empty for a place like this. Not many menu choices, and serving sizes were TINY. Won't be back tbh but it was good-ish in the moment. The waitress was so sweet! Actually amazing service so we left her a great tip to show our appreciation!"}
{"text":"The steak was overcooked. Sent it back, came back overcooked. This is a disappointing experience for a restaurant that perceives itself as one of the best in the city. Sad day for the City of Toronto. Don't order the steak."}
{"text":"Service was good (because we were spending a ton of money). They even brought a little stool out for the ladies' purses. Food is so-so and extremely overpriced, hence the two stars.    It's a good place to people watch (I've been told that it's a good place for celebrity sightings) - but particularly if you enjoy watching old dudes with their barely-legal companions.  There was Red, who wore a tiny, red tartan bustier and skintight jeans that were so low-riding they started at her pubic bone.  Then there was Baby, who looked about 16 and wore a paper-thin wife beater with no bra, a pair of sloppy jeans, and a pair of fake, fuzzy mukluks.  I can see why they'd choose One - there's a hotel located conveniently upstairs!  What I don't understand is, if I were in that line of work and I were meeting a patron in such a swanky locale, I'd opt for a barely-there cocktail dress.  Why wear jeans???  Anyway, the food.  My French onion soup was really sweet, for some odd reason.  It tasted like I was drinking onion syrup, basically.  And the sad thing was, there was only a little sprinkle of cheese on top of a small slice of crunchy garlic bread - and I think that French onion soup should be covered in a respectable layer of delicious, bubbly cheese.  The garlic bread was nice, but the soup was pretty atrocious.  My striploin was cold, which was a crime.  If you're going to charge $70 for a steak, it better be really good!  But it was cold probably because they cooked it first (and it needed very little time on the grill since I wanted it rare), so they had it waiting for all the other dishes to be ready so that they could serve it at the same time.  I think they should have grilled the steaks last.  It tasted alright, and it was decent beef, but for it to be cold, and $70 to boot?  No.  The marrow was ok.  There wasn't much of it, though, and It could've used some salt.  The best part was probably the truffle fries.  Truffle, parmiggiano-reggiano, and fried potatoes just go together perfectly, like chicken and rice.  It was way overpriced, but it was tasty.  Overall, the service was very, very courteous and attentive (even though it was kind of funny how our server answered everything - comments, non yes/no questions - with \"Cheers.\"), but the food was just no good.  The service and people watching deserve one star each.  But to charge such a high price for subpar food?  No.  Skip it."}
{"text":"I was wandering around Yorkville and came across this restaurant when the Starbucks across the street was too packed to get a coffee.  I walked in around 11:30 am and the hostess asked if I had reservations, I don't and she was very nice and said if I don't mine sitting inside, she can seat me. The patio was open and jammed pack but the restaurant inside was not too full. I prefer the inside anyway so Bonus for me.  The server was very attentive and provided answers to questions I had regarding the preparations of the dishes.  I ordered:  Steak Tartare - perfectly made, infused with spices, capers and topped with a quail egg, plated with fricasse and artichoke hearts, rice crisp wafers and banquette slices.  Duck Confit Salad - this was a large lunch portion, Perfectly plump crispy skinned duck leg sitting on top of a beautifully put together beets, walnuts salad. The duck leg was perfectly seasoned and the meat was so tender while the skin was not fatty but crispy.  Peach Semifreddo - served with peaches poached in liquor over beautifully made Peach Semifreddo surprisingly light and not too sweet!   After I ordered, I sat back and enjoy the scenery. Lots of very smartly dressed business people, Chanel wearing ladies doing lunch and movie stars. (Now I get why there were so many photogs outside) Mr Wonderful aka Kevin O'Leary was sitting at the table next to me.  The server brought out a nicely display dish and put it down on the table.  It was Tuna Sashimi served bite size. I did asked questions about the preparation but I did not ordered it. When I brought it to the server's attention. He asked if I will take it at his compliment since it was his mistake.  The Tuna Sashimi was served on 4 Chinese Soup Spoons, pan seared along the edge and raw inside with Soy, wasabi sauce drizzle on top. It was ok, slightly salty and not very special. I am glad I did not order it.  All in all, a great meal, service was impeccable.. and as I was leaving, ran into Kate Hudson."}
{"text":"Love the burgers here. Very juicy and flavorful. It is pretty big so sharing would actually make more sense. The fries are good too.  I had the grilled chicken \"cobb style\" salad the other time and it was pretty good too. The chicken was not too dry which is a common complaint I have about chicken. The dressing was light and not overly used. I had to request an egg, but not sure if it already comes with one since the menu did not list egg as an ingredient but did say cobb style which may or may not include an egg. Can't eat a salad with no egg. Also a big portion, so could be shared.  Service was good and prompt."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. For the price I would say this places met expectations but did not exceed them. I don't know if I would go back because there are plenty of good places by this location."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the McEwan line of restaurants and have been to them all except for One. :) As soon as winterlicious rolled around I made it a must to try this restaurant out.  We came in on a Friday night for our 8pm reservations. There was no one at the hostess desk when we arrived, I believe she was seating someone, she arrived back within a few minutes and kindly greeted us and checked our coats. We were lead pass the bar into the main dining room.  The dining room was dimly lit and the walls were upholstered with funky blue-grey fur tiles framed with silver. We were seated at a large two person table against a long banquet by a window that ran through the length of the dining room. I liked that the table was big but I felt like I had to yell across to my hubby in order for him to hear me which I didn't like.  To drink I already knew what I wanted as in all the McEwan restaurants they carry the same cocktail list Lipstick Martini - Raspberry infused Ketel One Vodka, fresh raspberry, champagne  Absolutely love the boozy macerated bits of raspberries, I took my time drinking this because as innocent as it looks it does pack an alcoholic punch  After placing our order we were greeted by the \"bread boy\" who gave us a choice of bread to pick from. I choose multigrain and hubby chose red pepper. The small slice of bread was served warm with a crusty exterior and chewy interior. However I think the red pepper bread overpowered everything as my multigrain tasted like red pepper.  Onto the winterlicious line up, this is what I ordered:  Parsnip Soup - Pumpernickel gremolata, spiced apple, nutmeg Chantilly, sage  The presentation of this soup was quite a production, the soup bowl nicely warmed was placed infront of me with the cream and gremolata sitting in the bottom, the waiter then poured the soup from a little kettle into my bowl The soup was luxuriously creamy with the distinct parsnip flavour served at the perfect temperature with contrasting cool chantilly and crunchy pumpernickel gremolata. I thoroughly enjoyed it  Scallops - Butternut squash puree, blood orange, pain d'epice, brown butter and bacon foam Another beautifully plated dish, the scallops were perfectly cooked and the smear of creamy butternut squash added a sweetness to the dish balanced by the tangy oranges My only complaint about the dish was that it was an incredibly tiny portion and I felt that it was lacking the components to deem it a main course, it was a dish better suited to be a first course   Thankfully I ordered a side from the regular menu, as I can never pass them by when I see them on a menu  Brussels Sprouts - double smoked bacon and maple syrup Like candy! I absolutely loved these sweet morsels with the chunks of salty crispy bacon scattered through out. Dare I say I loved these more than my main?    Valrhona Chocolate Pot De Creme - Peanut brittle, Chantilly cream, cocoa crumble, fleur de sel  Again beautifully presented, very light and airy and not overwhelmingly sweet nor chocolatey, loved the cocoa crumble on top Again the same complaint as in my main - I wanted more as the pot de creme barely filled a quarter of the glass.  Overall I don't think I would return for a winterlicious sampling at this restaurant as the portions were too tiny and left me wanting more. However the single dish we ordered from the regular menu was the clear winner of the night so maybe it's worth checking out there regular menu. However I am still of the McEwan line up but One unfortunately isn't at the top of my list."}
