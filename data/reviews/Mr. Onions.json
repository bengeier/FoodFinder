{"text":"My companion and I were pleased with the service and food.    I got the liver and onions with mashed potatoes, with a side order of sauted mushrooms,  and it was comfort food at its best.   My partner's plate was piled sky high and being a big eater he did not finish.      One place to try if you want something better than and unique in comparison to the  Harveys, Swiss Chalet and McDonalds situated right across the street..     As long as you do not mind the interior not being updated to the standards of those franchise places because this place takes you back in time.  Home cooked meal time."}
{"text":"Hidden beside a car wash at Keele and St Clair one can be excused for not immediately noticing the scrolling banner board advertising the best Steak and Fish in the city. While that is definitely a gross overstatement, Mr Onions has it merits as a cheap but tasty diner.   The menu claims that the food is prepared by a World Master Chef, but you wouldn't know it from the presentation or décor of the restaurant. It's a room in desperate need of an overhaul; from the old peeling wallpaper, to plastic tablecloths all the way to a bookshelf filled with old economics textbooks.   Once you get past the look of the place, you will find that the taste really hits the mark. The all day breakfast is the winner, with eggs cooked to order perfectly.  Their breakfast menu consists of the regulars (eggs benedict, steak and eggs) but at very reasonable prices compared to other joints in the city. We've returned several times and I've never had a bad breakfast at Mr Onions.   The dinner menu is fairly standard as well, with 8-10 entrées including the advertised Steak and Fish options. There is also a board at the entrance with 3 or 4 daily specials. For the most part you'll find a filling and decent meal here for under $10.   If you are in the area looking for a quick and cheap dinner, Mr Onions will definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Old school diners are fading out fast, and ones that deliver on every meal are few and far between.  Mr.Onions has a shady exterior but once inside this antique ma & pop shop is welcoming and delicious.  BREAKFAST: served all day, and why not. If you're  like me and reckon a family member makes the best pancakes, please give these a try. They are perfect, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. And these  cakes are huge. No need to order a short stack, I'm a 6'3\" giant and 2 of these with a side of thick cut bacon satisfies me.  My girlfriend loves the liver and onions, the VEAL liver and onions. We also checked out the chicken souvlaki, which may have been brined for 48hrs, as we've never enjoyed juicer cubes of skewered meat.  QUALITY CONTROL: from the steak and eggs to the french toast(8 slices strong), real care is put into each meal. Made to order and served hot.  PORTIONS TO PRICE: the only thing close would be a dennys buffet, but i prefer food from the pan not a hot tray  check this place out and support our small diners"}
{"text":"Going to Mr. Onion is the closest I've been to being a regular anywhere. Is is a 10 minute walk from my house and the food is good and super cheap. Bonus - they are open on most holidays for breakfast and lunch.  The best thing Mr. Onion has going for it is it's breakfast. It is served all day and no matter what time you go someone is ordering it. They use surprisingly thick bacon and I've never not had my eggs cooked correctly. The eggs Benedict is the cheapest in town at $7.90. It is decent, but sometimes the hollandaise is a bit thin.   As far as dinners go, most of the meals I've had are good home style cooking. The main is usually good, but the fries, onion rings and salads are blah. Their \"famous\" pioneer bread is garlicky and smothered in butter - worth ordering.  The service is quick and friendly. I believe it is a family business and there are only a couple different servers. They are all very attentive, keeping up with coffee and water refills and quietly checking in on tables without being annoying.   So, if you ever find yourself in this pseudo industrial area at breakfast time, I highly suggest you check out Mr. Onion!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go and eat here for like 30 years way back when it was the Purple Onion who moved around the corner onto Dundas St.  I tried going last summer and tried for about 2 weeks and it was closed every day.  I thought they had closed because the place looks like it should be.  I finally tried again today and found it open.  It wasn't until I notice all the good reviews I saw on Yelp that I thought I should try again.  Its just like all the reviews say.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  I had the steak and eggs.  DELISH !  I would have given it a 5 star but the eggs were a bit small but they were runny.  The water in my tea could have been a little hotter to.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"I hear the name \"Mr. Onions\", and I picture a fat, hairy guy that smells like fried onions and BO. I look at the outside of Mr. Onions, and I sort of picture that same fat guy to be eating in there. That being said- I was skeptical, and avoided Mr. Onions for almost a year, after moving to the neighborhood.  WHAT A MISTAKE!  Mr. Onions actually smells like delicious breakfast, and the cure to some wicked hangovers! The menu is fairly diverse, with lots of options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Portions are large, tea and coffee are bottomless, and the service is friendly. Don't expect extravagance...just hearty, tasty meals.   A breakfast joint, just isn't a breakfast joint in my books without a vegetarian eggs benny option- and theirs is delicious! Yummy looking waffles, and great fresh fruit as well!  Meat lovers will appreciate that they aren't skimpy on the bacon like many breakfast joints.  I'm SO glad that I opened my mind and was willing to give Mr. Onions a shot. It totally satisfies my need for a neighborhood breakfast locale, and doesn't break the bank either.   I'm not saying that the fat, smelly guy DOESN'T hang out there - but I have yet to see him!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food was delicious and in abundance. Bathrooms need a fixin"}
{"text":"Don'T judge a book by its cover.  It looks Kitshy, like greasy spoon but The food is tasty and hearty, Much more than I could say for the a lot of other diners.  Even the Kids meals are tasty."}
{"text":"Great breakfast for a reasonable price. Free parking available at Mark's across the street"}
{"text":"OUT OF BUSINESS   I stopped by for breakfast this morning, for the first time in about six weeks, and saw a for rent sign in the front window."}
{"text":"A really cozy small breakfast place. The food is pretty good and not really overpriced. A good place to go after a night out, when you don't have the energy to cook in the morning.  Perfect if you live in the area, but as much as I like it, it's not really worth traveling more than 20 minutes for.  Parking can be a bit of a problem, but there is a plaza across the street if you are willing to be a little sneaky. We never had a problem."}
{"text":"Deeeeeeelish! Highly recommend place for great eating!  Don't let the decor fool you. The food is really really good!  I think they are closed on Mondays but overall a great restaurant experience.  Much better than the purple onion restaurant which is  right down the street."}
{"text":"We stumbled into mr onions hung over from the night before. The shady exterior was a little bit frightening however once inside we were pleased to see a small comfortable lookint diner. We started off with soup of the day which happened to be cream of mushroom which was fantastic and quite filling. I theb got the number 2 combo with bacon which is your typical 3 eggs with bacon and home fries, great meal with great value. Overall a great dining experience! Only lost 1 star for the cleanliness of the washroom."}
{"text":"Mr. Onions (formerly called Mr. Purple Onion and not to be confused with The Purple Onion, which is also a steakhouse/grill and coincidentally located 1.1 km away on Dundas Street West - confused yet!?) looks incredibly suspect from the outside - the signage is terribly tacky and the interior decor isn't much better, what with its gingham tablecloths and kitschy truck stop diner feel. It'd be a shame not to mention the 1970s Reader's Digest issues and random books on the shelves. Titles include: \"Intro To Accounting\", \"Calculus Fundamentals\" and \"Raising Adopted Children\". There's also a floor to ceiling display of photos of past diners with Comic Sans name captions.   On to the menu, which proved to be much more intriguing. There was a full selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner items and the breakfast is served all day, which obviously bodes well for a positive rating in my books.   For a brief moment I considered ordering the mega breakast - \"Pancakes, Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Homefries, Chicken Brochette, Tzatziki, Mixed Fruit, Cheese, Toast and Coffee/Juice or Tea\" for only $19.95, but then I remembered that I don't actually eat meat, so I opted for the Veg Eggs Benny instead.  The presentation was outstanding and not at all what I was expecting (never judge a book by its cover, right?): Perfectly poached eggs (ask for them soft, medium or hard - these folks know how to poach an egg!) with fresh baby spinach smothered in hollandaise with sliced tomatoes on the side. I'm not a fan of onions (SHUT UP) so I asked for fruit salad instead of homefries and it was not a mistake. The fruit salad was bursting with A+ quality fruits like kiwis, strawberries, mango, pineapple, oranges and blueberries. No honeydew melon or grapes here, only top grade fruit.   A very enjoyable meal and of amazing value for under $10 total per person. I removed one star because the server wasn't very humourous and didn't like my jokes, and the service was a bit slow/inattentive."}
