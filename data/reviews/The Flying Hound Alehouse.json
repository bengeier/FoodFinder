{"text":"Great beer selection! Got an Oktoberfest in the springtime, totally made my day! Mussels and poutine were great-granted made with cheese as opposed to cheese curds. Worth the moula, was a little disappointed in the sausage platter as it was not a lot for $9, but they had a good kick to them! Nice area, good place to chill and the staff were excellent! Definitely gonna have to hang out here more often."}
{"text":"The bar staff is fantastic. Always engaging and friendly and often recommend beers to try. The food is also delicious. One of my favorite places to have a beer on this side of town."}
{"text":"The service could use some improvement.  This restaurant is understaffed and unable or properly handle peak times.  We were told there is no wait, but  ended up waiting for 20 minutes for a table.  Proper service at the bar is also lacking.

On the bright side, the beer selection is good and the food is pretty tasty.  If you're willing to wait and don't mind poor service, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Terrible over priced food. If you enjoy paying 9 dollars for a brat then by all means go wash it down with a 14 dollar beer. 

Their menu is not very good and their specials are cheap. (meaning they add a lot of cheap carbs instead of actual good food.) 

The bar staff is by far the rudest staff I have ever visited. The only one worth a damn is John. 

Bar manager is rude and got into argument about a 1.50 chicken tender when I had a 70.00 bill and I've spent probably close to 1000.00 in a few months at this place. 

Don't go you will likely be disappointed and upset you spent all that money. Go somewhere that actually likes their clientele and wants to please a customer."}
{"text":"Bar area was great,  nice beer selection.  as long as you didn't want to get seated... After being told we were \"next \" watched 3 couples get seated before the 2 of us. No acknowledgement that we waited much longer than our hour wait time.  When we final got seated it seemed an inconvenience.  We then left without dinner."}
{"text":"Upscale bar ambience, fabulous selection of European beers on tap and some fine single malt scotch whiskeys. They can whip up some really good cocktails as well. 

I've tried their food only a couple of times (we usually go there on the weekends late night for drinks) and we've liked it on each occasion - especially their Tandoori Chicken Skewers."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, especially for a new restaurant. I order the Schnitzel Platter, which came out a bit under-done but this was due to the thickness of the pork. I pointed it out and they quickly brought me a new one which was excellent. The server and management went above and beyond my expectation with rectifying the issue. We had started with the sausage sampler which was delicious. Their sauerkraut was some of the best I have ever had. My wife ordered the fish and chips, and the fish was done wonderfully, not greasy with the perfect amount of batter.  Great beer list as well as whiskeys at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"So happy we decided to try here.

My bf and I came here during HH. I had the steakhouse burger cooked medium rare and the bf had a bacon cheeseburger cooked rare. They were PHENOMENAL. We both had an average expectation for the fare here, it being a tap house joint n all, but we were *genuinely* happily surprised. Awesome sauce on the steakhouse burger. Oh and the sweet potato fries were perfection as well. We both had a few beers and the bf, quite an ex-Californian beer snob, was impressed by their large beer selection and he gave them a thumbs up. There are stouts, sours, Belgians and IPA's here :) As far as the service, they've probably stepped it up after the few people below me complained because our waitress was pleasant, punctual, not overly annoying, and came by after our food was served to make sure everything was ok. Yeah and this place IS loud, but it's also dark, and pretty classy. Good job."}
{"text":"Staff has always been friendly and nice. Even on a busy night, we are always surprised by how fast our drinks and food comes out!  Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, average food, poor service. There's about 40 beer selections on tap, ranging from local microbrews to imports. The drinks are reasonable priced $5-8 depending on beer or cocktail.  The food was average, nothing really stood out. We had fish and chips, burgers, and a portabella mushroom sandwich. All the food was very appealing. Everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered. The only suggestion would be choosing the sweet potato fries over the regular fries. The service is what really gives flying hound only 3 stars. Our waitress was very inattentive, we ordered an appetizer but never got it. The good part was it wasn't on the check, we asked her about it and she remembered us ordering it but seemed to forget putting the order in. Willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"I had the poutine for lunch and it was very good. I wish I could have had a half order but that's what I get for ordering an app for my lunch. An ale would have been perfect with how rich is was but sadly it was my work lunch. Looking forward to the next trip. My co-worker had the Spicy chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Also very good. Especially if you ask them for a side of spicy aioli!  Great staff too."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. Chili was all chili powder. The grilled cheese wasn't grilled it was toasted,bread dried out and hard. It was absolutely inedible. The staff not very polite at all. This is a restaurant that is a waste of MONEY and Time. Do not go here. It was our first time and will be our last"}
{"text":"I went in alone after work for a beer. The place is lovely with a nice pub feel and it's in a part of town where very nearby tavern options are limited. The beer selection was great and the servers were sweet. But, I ordered the poutine for dinner and it was gross. Gravy came on the side and was overpoweringly oniony. Worse, the fries were covered with provolone and OREGANO. Just pounds of oregano. Blech. I'd go again for just a beer, but will likely avoid the food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the beer list was awesome. That's where the good stops. We had poor service and the food was just ok. (Mixed greens tasted like dirt) Mostly, it was the server that made it not a pleasant experience. She was pretty rude in the way she talked, and to top it off, my beer glass sat empty for 10 minutes at the edge of the table. She walked by half a dozen times without saying a word, going to her other couple of tables several times. It wasn't very busy... I'll give the place another try, hopefully a different server will change my opinion of the place."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have good service every time I go-which is at least once per month. I enjoy the rotating selection of beer. 
I am obsessed with the onion gravy they serve with the poutine! I have a hard time ordering poutine anywhere else now. I feel the brand or supplier of the fries has changed a few times since they've been open... but as long as they keep them thin and crispy I'll be happy!"}
{"text":"Outstanding NE clam chowdah!!!  Great beers and great menu.  The service is excellent and fast.  This is a place I would highly recommend for lunch or dinner.  Atmosphere is friendly and clean.  Overall you have to check them out.  Even if it's for a beer and soup."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Perfect atmosphere for outdoor or indoor dining.  Great selection of beers on tap, both local and around-the-globe.  The food was delicious and Pam, our waitress, shined!"}
{"text":"I had the salmon sandwich with greens. It was done to perfection and tasted amazing. I will definitely order this again."}
{"text":"Awesome tap list and very affordable wine menu. The food was pretty delicious and came out in a timely fashion. My only worry is the staff. I know it's new but 4 out of 5 empty glasses for more than 10 minutes is a little concerning. I hope it's just a bump on the training road because this place could be great for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sat outside expecting ambiance of hwy pd noise but not really detectable,  highly recommend a scotch ale with scotch egg appetizers.  Excellent with mildly spicy mustard sauce.  Also ordered three sausage appetizer plate with kraut, garlic toast and two very complimentary sauces.  All mixed together...........=nice Wisconsin summer evening.  Big thumbs up for Flying Hound!"}
{"text":"Great times at the hound!  China was terrific behind the bar, drinks were great.  Very engaging and a great overall experience!"}
{"text":"Second time here and the fries the best part of our experience.  Waitress seemed annoyed at us being there, only came by the minimum to ask our order, bring our food and check. First time had a similar experience with the bartender, who was rude and had to be flagged down, not that he was busy helping customers. How can one place have so many unfriendly staff?"}
{"text":"Overall, I do recommend the Flying Hound. In particular they have great outdoor seating, I think the little fire ring area with chairs would be a great place to visit with friends on a nice evening over drinks. The service is ok. Once I ordered a sandwich and specifically asked for no tomatoes and when they brought it to me with them on the sandwich I let the server know I had ordered the sandwich without and he took it back to the kitchen. He then came back two minutes later with essentially the same sandwich, they had simply taken the tomatoes off of it, not made me a new one. Thankfully I'm not allergic to tomatoes, however, anyone who doesn't like tomatoes knows that the flavor of the seeds and drippings are very noticeable, hence,I would have appreciated a new sandwich. I have had the mussels there, they were good, although not as good as the mussels at Sardines. The patio salad is excellent,I highly recommend it. I also recommend the beer cheese soup. The French onion soup is meh. It came with one slice of muenster cheese laid over the bowl and likely simply microwaved until it melted. A good French onion soup is topped with broiled cheese, typically Swiss or Gruyere. One more recommendation I have for this restaurant is to move the ashtray for employees out of sight of the guests dining outside. Every single time I've been to this restaurant and dined outside I had a direct view of the kitchen staff smoking, not particularly appetizing. Overall a decent restaurant which I would still recommend."}
{"text":"I like this place, their burgers are tasty since they use fresh, local meat.  On my most recent visit,  I was disappointed to discover that the iced tea comes from a soda gun.  Their Greek salad was tasty, the dressing tasted homemade, but the baguette served with it fell short.  (Even though I was told it came from Clasen's). It tasted no better than the average grocery store baguette, actually it tasted worse.  The onion soup was delicious, the croutons they used still had a crunch which reaffirmed the made to order idea.  Their beer selection is expansive which is nice.  Overall, I enjoy The Flying Hound, they do most things well, they just have to work on carrying good quality through the whole meal/entree."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and have been pleasantly surprised.  My wife has had the macaroni both times and loves it.  The spicy citrus chicken is definitely spicy but the spice doesn't mask the flavor.  The pulled pork sandwich was just o.k.  It was greasy and didn't have much flavor.  The sweet potato fries are the best I've had at any restaurant.  I would eat here just for the fries a cold tap beer."}
{"text":"Cool new place in Fitchburg.  They have a large amount of beers on tap and the atmosphere is great.  The food is sub-par compared to other places in Madison.  Go for beers but eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good fish fry on Fridays.  Good assortment of beers on tap, and always a reasonably priced local craft brew option.  Can't beat the nachos and a beer out in the beer garden on a nice day."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for different reasons - business lunches, family dinner, business networking events and out for the evening. It's always been a great experience.  Servers, bartenders, managers and kitchen staff are all friendly, knowledgable and very accommodating.  I'm not much of a beer drinker but I know enough to know that they have a great selection.  It rotates and the staff seems to be well educated on all of the varieties. They also have a very solid selection of liquors including some excellent craft spirits.  Some great specialty cocktails as well. 

The food has been very good as well, I've tried a variety of appetizers and entrees and have never been disappointed.  Their burgers are great and have always been cooked exactly how I requested, love their apps as well. The nachos are a meal and a good one at that.

The Flying Hound is an excellent addition to the southwest side of Madison.  Glad to have you in the neighborhood and thanks for all the great service and experiences"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in on a Saturday night for some drinks and food. We opted to go the appetizer only route as am big on sharing. We ordered the Tandoori Chicken Skewers, Surf and Turf Crostini and the bowl of French Onion Soup. I appreciated the fact that so many of their appetizer options were not fried. I am trying to stay away from fried food.  My boyfriend really liked the chicken skewers while I really liked the crostini, especially the chimichurri sauce! YUM! The soup was also fantastic - I love French Onion Soup when done correctly. This definitely was! Like most places popping up these days they had plenty of beer options to choose from. I opted for a cocktail and tried the Tully Smash. Double YUM. I would order that over and over again. My only two issues with the joint was the service left a little more to be desired and the place was too dark for my liking. All in all if I am on that side of town and looking for a bite to eat I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was great but they charge for chasers for Bloody Mary's. I mentioned my surprise at this and a gentleman that works there said it was only a dollar....Fair enough but not normal for a Wisconsin bar."}
{"text":"Just stopped in with family. Beer selection and service were excellent as was the food. Really enjoyed the special sandwich and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Two great visits to the Hound, including some fantastic walleye from their Friday menu. Always good to steer away from the fried fish on these occasions. Poutine was great, as were the salmon sandwich and chicken sandwich. Definitely heading back. The only negative is how loud the restaurant was, making chatting difficult even at our tiny table."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, lots of beer choices and good atmosphere! Go there quite a bit and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"We went there a few months back and weren't impressed.  The service was OK at best, the décor OK and the place seemed clean.  The food was kinda boring.  My son had a burger that wasn't anything to write home about, my wife a blackened chicken sandwich that was salty and I had a Rueben that was also salty.  We also tried their French onion soup that was a complete disappointment.  It was a bunch of stale croutons with cheese on top with a very salty onion broth.  With all the restaurant choices  in the area I don't see a compelling reason to go back."}
{"text":"This was was a craft beer stop on a rip through Wi so didn't have any food so this review is only for the craft beer selection.

The place is deceiving because it's in a strip mall and until you walk in, you can't get a good idea of what this place is. This is another one of those cool places with high ceilings and exposed stone walls behind the bar. It has rich red walls and dark woods balanced by the lighter wood floors. There is some big flat screens for all the games but not tons of them like some places. The back does have some out door seating for the nice days.

The craft beer menu was very diverse with beers from all over the country and the world. I had some sheeps brewery dark beer that I can't remember the name but it was cold and good.

Overall I found this place to be a nice place for some craft beer and just chill with friends."}
{"text":"We have visited The Flying Hound twice now since moving to the area and have had different experiences each time. The first time our server was very friendly and helpful when it came to the menu. We had the jalapeño poppers as an appetizer and they were delicious, and then had burgers as our entree which were both great. The second time we stopped in our waitress was nice, but not nearly as helpful. The place wasn't busy at all and she hardly stopped by our table throughout the duration of our meal. We once again ordered the jalapeño poppers and this time they were so spicy that we couldn't finish them. I'm not sure what would have changed from our previous visit to make them that much spicier, but it was unbearable. As I mentioned our server didn't visit our table very often, and we were dying for more drinks, which made the problem seem probably worse than it was.

Aside from the spicy poppers issue, we do enjoy this place. They have a spectacular beer selection and the burgers are super good. We will more than likely return, but from now on no more jalapeño poppers!"}
{"text":"It was good.  Lots of wonderful beers.  The food was just ok.  I was really hoping for better food.  I would go again and give it another try.  The service was fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time around 4:45 on 04/09/16. We got seated right away as there was maybe 10 people there. It took 10 minutes for somebody to finally ask if we had been helped/tke our drink order after several staff walked by us and were standing around the bar. To the server's credit it was almost quitting time for her and this was not her table but she still helped out 
I ordered an Elmer T Lee on the rocks for $8 off of their bourbon list which was bigger than I expected.  When it showed up I thought it was a 7&7 with how much fluid there was. Then I tasted it and realized that it was SO WATERED DOWN!  I mean this was basically water.  I know my bourbon having 53 bottles at home ranging from makers mark, 1792, van winkle lot B, Lost Prophet, 4 Roses Single Barrel...  When I told my wife I demonstrated how watered down it was by \"rinsing my mouth\" with it because there was no burn/finish whatsoever.  She mentioned that explains the comment she heard the bartender say,\"that's the last of the Elmer T. Lee\". 
Look at the pictures and judge for yourself. 
The burger I had wasn't any better than 5 Guys and the wife said her fish was \"ok\". 
Got missed for 10 minutes after being seated, got a 3/4 water to 1/4 bourbon $8 drink and so so food. That about sums it up"}
{"text":"Disappointing, first time tonight. We went in a whim. We were greeted and seated. That was all well and good however it then took what felt like an eternity for our waitress. Long enough that we had decided what we wanted for an app and dinner. Cheese curds which I heard were great. I decided on the flying hound burger and fries my wife went with the spicy blue burger and fries and a glass of wine. We waited for a while but no curds.. After a while our food showed up. Still no curds.... Kind of the reason we went. They asked if we still wanted them but what was the point. We were starving so time to eat. I dug into the fries and I will say they were delicious. I the bit into my burger. Ummm how can I say this so you get true feel for it. It was like trying the bite through rubber (that should do) Trying to bite through the bun was a chore. Once I did I can say the actual meat was good. I should have asked for no arugula on it or taken it off but that's on me. My wife had a similar problem with the bun. She was also a little turned off as far as the flavor. She likes spice and there was none in her mind. She can handle some pretty spicy foods so it may have been spicy to someone but not up to her standards. Prices weren't bad but I expected better quality. At least we didn't get charged for the curds we didn't get. I think I will pass on ever needing to go back."}
{"text":"Great tap menu! If you are looking for a good beer or three and some appetizers, this is a great place. The patio was surprisingly quiet with regard to traffic noise and perfectly amenable to two parents who wanted a beer and had their kids along.  This is a Saturday night around 6:30. Loved my lagunitas glass that my beer came in!! 
We ordered cheese curds and poutine to start - I'm not a poutine fan but the hubs is.  The gravy was served on the side which I appreciated as my vegetarian daughter wanted a few of those cheesy fries! I'll comment on one entree that my daughter had and the short rib sliders, which I chose for dinner. The grilled cheese had a garlic spread along with arugula and tomato; highly adventurous for my kiddo and well received. She loved the melted cheese on top and didn't think the cheese was too stringy which she hates. She didn't get a lot of garlic flavor which was missed, but thought the arugula and tomato added to the sandwich nicely. I noted that the tomato was good and firm and didn't contribute to any bread sogginess.
My sliders were a bit lacking.  Description is outstanding but the onions I had weren't caramelized, they were softened, and there's a big difference which drives me nuts when restaurants don't deliver on. The dill pickle on two of the three sliders was essentially a small chip which is kind of lame. Nice work on the decent buns but it ended up to be a lot of bread for what it was. All in all I felt like the beef, cheese, and onions all congregated to make a slightly congealed pile set inside a bun with a bit of pickle to add crunch. 
The service was super friendly and absolutely prompt. The menu has plenty of options. The cheese curds come with a pepper dipping sauce which is certainly unique around here and was pretty good. As is usual with my 3's - decent but probably not very high on your list to rush back to for dinner."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. My husband ordered the Fish Fry and I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy. My husband said the Fish Fry was over salted and when I tasted it, I agreed. The coleslaw and side salad were standard and unremarkable.

I ordered French Onion Soup to start. I think this was a huge miss as the broth was over peppered and over salted. Also, it didn't have the layered complexity an onion soup should by adding some wine and finishing with cognac. 

The Shrimp Po Boy was served on a 'baguette' with a rémoulade sauce. The seasoning on the shrimp didn't complement the rémoulade well but that can be overlooked. The real issue with this sandwich was the bread. It definitely wasn't crusty or flavorful as one would expect with a baguette. Instead the bread was like a slightly under baked white roll that could have done with some toasting. Adding the crunch to the sandwich would have been an interesting textural component. Also, the addition of bacon was unnecessary as it increased the saltiness through the roof.

I would say this place is a miss on food but they definitely have a decent drink selection."}
{"text":"Happened to have duck soup for the soup of the day, was totally great and not over salted which is hard to do with duck, it was amazingly good, a bit slow on the service but don't let that you discourage you from having some of the best food around! Perfectly cooked to order burger (medium rare of course) and crispy fries, those that complain got a bad cook and need to go back today! Huge range of only good beer, friendly service and free samples how can you go wrong?! You can't! Also that great cooked over charcoal flavor, very yum!"}
{"text":"Great tap beers. Good food. Simple decor. Friendly staff. Good lunch spot for shopping day trip."}
{"text":"Tried new place. Inside nice has a pub feel to it. Large selection of beer both tap and bottle. Food not great. Ok but not great.  Had spicy citrus chicken. Really a piece of grilled chicken with very spicy wing sauce on it.  Too hot overpowered the taste of the chicken.  No free wi-fi.  Tampa Bay/Detroit game on. Asked for Brewer game to be turned on-which was weird Brewers in 1st and we are in Wisconsin. Leaning more toward not making this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Experiencing The Flying Hound on three very different occasions provides a certainly accurate review. Dontcha think?

First was on an early Saturday afternoon for lunch. I was helping a friend move into the area from Madison and we stopped for lunch. I had poutine. For lunch. Don't judge me. Well...at least don't judge me poorly...or just look away! 

The poutine onion gravy makes this dish worthwhile. The french fries are thin and basic, the squeaky yellow curds are standard. Actually, I wonder if the curds are local at all. I always forget to ask! Anyway...pair it with a local brew and you have an indulgent, sloppy meal that will remind me to run an extra few miles in the upcoming week!

A second visit occurred for a highly exciting UW Football home game. I was expecting standing room as my squad arrived about 20 minutes before kickoff. There were plenty of high tops and dining tables to choose from - yay (albeit slightly confusing)! The Southwestern salad was massive - tasty light greens, lots of avocado (+++++), crunchy chip strips, and an indulgent dill ranch dressing that wasn't soakingly soppy. This was a decent salad! Proportions made it worth the $10 price tag.

Let's wrap this review up with my most recent visit - brunch. There isn't any. SERIOUSLY???? Fitchburg lacks any brunch game. I was so disappointed, but still too hungry to drive the beltline to Madison, Monona, or Middleton. FHA doesn't open until 11AM on Sundays - perhaps this is some sort of European tradition (since the venue is themed around a slight Euro-football feel), which was the initial trigger of disappointment. Great - so I overindulged and had breakfast poutine (no need for perked ears, this was just poutine for breakfast) and coffee. Granted, the coffee was decent - better than Starbucks and brewed fresh (I asked) but nothing that tasted like a local cup of pick-me-up. While my company and conversation were lovely, the food was just 'meh'.

For what it's worth, the wait staff were fantastic every single time! Although the attempted brunch morning was easily overstaffed. 4-6 employees standing around the bar area, talking and watching TV, not really doing anything...seems like a waste of resources.

Overall, I would stop again for bar food, brews, and good company as this is one of the only venues I can think of in Fitchburg that isn't fast food or a chain restaurant. A-OK (3 stars) is very accurate."}
{"text":"Food service ends at 10 p.m., so don't dawdle getting here. Just be sure to arrive before that and the food is good. European leaning menu for both food and beer but plenty of domestic brews. Really liking the double chocolate stout they're serving now. Options change regularly, so if you find one you like, get here often 'cause it won't be here for long!"}
{"text":"Family-friendly bar-like atmosphere with a chill beer garden in the back. Not sure what it takes to get seating at the fire pit table, but that is a cool addition whether you're seated there or not. 

Few but solid menu options, like you'd expect to find at a place with \"Alehouse\" in its name. The steakhouse burger I ordered medium well, because I'm afraid of being judged, actually came well done. This was a huge relief to me, haha. It was delicious, the perfect burger with all the toppings and no compromise. I especially loved the dressed fresh greens as a side option -- surprisingly you don't see that a lot in Madison, and this is the one thing that would bring me back. The portion sizes and pricing are also reasonable -- just enough that one person should be eating. 

If I had to pick a second thing that would bring me back, it's the beer, cider, and mixed drinks selection. There's something for everyone, without being overwhelming. Its location next to the AMC Fitchburg theater means I'll be back next time I'm in for a nice dinner and movie."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch the game, knock back some quality beers and have a decent sandwich. I will admit, I like the name and the logo, as both remind me of a late Gorden Setter I used to know. The dog theme of the restaurant/pub is continued with the tin signs on the wall. A good mix of high bar tables and low tables, with a bench with a back running the entire length of the table area.  is I've noticed during the week the clientele changes over from sports fans cheering on the Badgers to ladies who lunch with mixed cocktails (and the odd child in tow). Being across the parking lot from the giant Target, it didn't take long for the Mommies to find this place. The schnitzel in the schnitzel sandwich started out bigger than the bun it was on, and then as time moved on, got progressively smaller.  The last time I visited, I tried the ham and cheese sandwich with the coleslaw while watching Badger's get unfortunately trounced by Iowa. It was as advertised on the menu. I would definitely look into trying a sampling of the beers here."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this new pub in Fitchburg on our date night. The place was hopping at 5pm on a Saturday! We ordered chicken fingers for an appetizer with some sweet potato fries. The chicken fingers weren't impressive and neither were the fries. FYI, the side of fries with the chicken fingers are prepared differently than the sweet potato fries appetizer which comes some sort of spicy seasoning. I wish I would have gotten that instead.

I also tried the French onion soup. It was very good and not too salty. My wife had the fish fry and I had the spicy blue burger. Both were tasty. A huge party foul though...I ordered my burger medium and it came well done. I was hungry so I went ahead and ate it, but obviously, not a good first impression. On a side note, the offer Sriracha at the tables as a condiment. I ordered a ramekin of mayo and made my own spicy mayo to dip my sweet potato fries in. Very delicious, but too bad they don't do this already.

Overall, the visit was good and the pub has a great fresh look and ambiance. There's nothing unique enough for me though (no brewery, small space, food was so-so). I might give it another try after they work out the new place jitters."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Food is normally good. Have had issues with the salmon being raw but last few times it has been cooked correctly. Service still leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone here a couple of times now. Each time we are pleased with the food and they have a great selection of beer. It is always changing so you can always try something new. 

The dinner room has a pretty cool vibe, but is smaller. We have gone on off hours or had a reservation, but it is on the smaller side so I could see that on busy weekends there might be a wait."}
{"text":"It's hard to accurately review a restaurant after eating a whole Shephard's Pie; mostly because initially you are so excited for dinner, but afterwards you're so full that you rethink every decision leading up to it. Yes, I had the Shephard's Pie and it was everything and more that I could have hoped for. Yes, I'm still very full an hour later.

We had a late dinner (close to 8pm), so seating was very easy to get. The waiter was very accommodating (almost overly - but he knew the line) and recommended great beers from their very extensive list. He even scored me the last Shephard's Pie, which could have been a lie - but he sold me!

The atmosphere wasn't too loud, great to carry on a conversation and the lighting was dim, but I could still read the menu. As it got closer to 10, the lights dimmed even more.

I definitely need to come back again, the hype was accurate. Yay, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I went to The Flying Hound Alehouse last night for a drink with a friend and ended up trying their food too. Right off the bat I loved the English pub feel. The staff were all very friendly through our entire time there. Even as the last remaining employee was trying to close up shop and we were obliviously still talking away he was very polite and patient. 

I got the Blood Moon cocktail which was delicious. As for eating, if you are a vegan you will have some options of veggie-patty burgers, sides, and salads. The creativity of the burgers looks pretty cheese and meet dependent, so heads up that the burgers might be boring...but I didn't try one. None of the entrees are veggie or can be made with veggie substitutions as far as I could tell. I got the harvest salad without bacon or cheese and added avocado for a price. I also got a side of french fries of course. The salad was filling (I had to use a doggie bag for about a third of it) and I loved the generous amount of nuts and cherries in it. The vinaigrette was yummy too. The fries were fries...hard to do wrong and I gladly ate the whole dish! 

Lastly, if you're a vegan who gets turned off by a wide array of meat dishes on a menu (like bacon on a stick, pulled pork quesadilla, mussels, and sausage platter) this alehouse might not be the place for you. I'm a bit like that but I know some of you vegans are moreso!

I'm giving three stars (A-OK) because though The Flying Hound is unapologetically what it is supposed to be--an English Alehouse with a lot of meat and cheese on the menu--it would be a hard place for me to come on a regular basis as a vegan. It makes an effort to offer some veggie options but none that really look veganteresting. Alas, not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Great food, lousy service pretty much sums up our visit.  My wife and I both had the walleye on a Friday evening and it was outstanding.  The fries were excellent as was the cole slaw and even the house made tartar sauce.  If only the service was as good as the food....  Brittany, our server, was friendly.  We just didn't see much of her!   After we were seated, it took a long (!) time to order our drinks.  Then it took quite awhile to get the drinks and after that, Brittany vanished.  Our food was brought by someone else and we never saw Brittany again.  We finished our meal and I went hunting for her just so we could pay our bill.  And the restaurant was not busy at all.  
  Bottom line:  The food is great, but it's not worth enduring the nonexistent service to get that food.  There are many restaurants in Madison that offer great food AND great service!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went Monday evening for dinner.  The decor is nice and the seating is comfortable.  A hostess seated us immediately.  The server, however, seemed scatterbrained.  Although menus were delivered, she did not pour us water or offer to take our drink orders before coming by to take our food order.  Her question to us:  \"Oh, did I not get your drinks?  Did you want any?\"

No.  Thanks.

We shared an order of Poutine which was serviceable but nothing stellar.  The Poutine is covered with onion gravy which presumably is used with the bangers & mash.  Poutine traditionally uses a rich brown gravy, which this was not.

I ordered the kale salad with cranberries, walnuts, parmesan, etc.  BF ordered the fish with slaw.  The fish was in shapes that were too perfect to be fresh.  I immediately thought that the fish must come off the back of a food truck.  We agreed the slaw was nasty.  Neither of us could identify what the seasoning was, but it was pretty awful.

The kale salad, although large and the kale a beautiful green, was undressed.  Thankfully the ingredients were tasty enough that it really did not need dressing, and without having been coated in dressing the leftovers were fresh the next day.

We didn't try any beer but the beer list was impressive.  I cannot comment on the serving temperature, glassware, etc., to tell you if they serve it well.

With so many new restaurants opening all the time in the Madison area, I doubt we will return to the Flying Hound for another meal."}
{"text":"Standard pub fare! The do offer a great special where specially markers beers are paired with burgers the combo is $12. 

Personally, I had the chicken piccata. It was fresh and tasty. My friend had the grilled cheese -- she enjoyed it but it was bit dry too me and we both commented there was too much lettuce on it.

Our other friend had the hound burger and it was only ok. The signature hounds tooth drink was good but I had to request a shot of simple syrup because it was bit too bitter but adding it definitely improved the overall flavor palette!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING is fabulous here, from the beer menu to the apps, to the desserts. Try the kale salad with salmon, and you'll never talk down on raw kale again! They make killer Moscow Mules, too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the imported beer selection. The pretzels and cheese curds were delicious. I had the salmon sandwich as my entree abd it was very good. I can also say that I tried the duck/pear salad and Citrus chicken sandwich were very good. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn on this place - love parts, not so sure about others. Have visited twice in the last month. Atmosphere is nice - definitely fits its name \"ale house\". Big bar with decent amount of indoor and outdoor seating. Beer selection is outstanding- some favorites and some rare finds. Lots to choose from. Service was ok, a bit odd the first time around, but good. 

Where I've struggled is the food. Both times I had a scotch egg. First time I shared one and it was amazing. Already knew I loved Scotch Eggs, but this one was really good. Second time around - it was really spicy - and I like spicy food. A bit inconsistent. For my meals I tried the Flying Hound Burger and the Spicy Citrus Chicken. Both were just ok, but wouldn't order again. The burger was a bit bland. Maybe it just didn't work together, but it was kind of forgettable. The Chicken sandwich totally needs fixing. All I could taste was the spice. Again, I like spicy foods a lot - but this was bad. It had arugula on it too which had a strong taste, but was lost among the spice on the chicken. 

I will go back- really love parts of this place, but hope they are working out the kinks in the menu."}
{"text":"The Flying Hound is a friendly pub in a strip mall in Fitchburg. Inside, it feels as if you're in a place downtown. It's a little loud due to the wood floor and stony walls; there's not much in the way of soft surfaces to damp down the noise. There's a large, well-fortified bar with good seating and a surprising number of tables inside as well.

The beer was good and there's a wide variety; pretty much par for the course in Madsion and nothing truly special for a place like this. However, the whisky list was quite good and decently priced, with a wide selection of single malts. That was the highlight.

Unfortunately, the food did not impress. I had a patty melt and it was cooked properly. However, the meat had a sour edge on a couple of bites and I'm pretty sure it wasn't fresh. Seeing as how I visited on a Saturday after the July 4th holiday, this doesn't surprise me. Fries were a mixed bag of fine and overcooked. Food was pouring out of the kitchen though, so who knows why that was.

The staff was very professional and for only having been open a few months, they're quite polished. It's obvious they're industry people who have worked elsewhere. The bartenders aren't you're average Wisconsin type bartenders; they want to fix drinks and be done. It's not a chatty kind of place, so if you're that kind of drinker, look elsewhere.

Service was good but the food underwhelmed. The Flying Hound has a big-city feel and would be a good place to have a couple after work, but it's not the sort of place that people become regulars at. Food was underwhelming and I'd stick to beer and cocktails -- if they want to be seen as gastropub, they're going to need to do better on that front. 

The Hound is a fine option for drinks if you're in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"This is a great spot! Their Friday fish fry is really, really good - I always go with the fried walleye and haven't been disappointed. I've also had a bite of the bangers and mash entree which is awesome as well. It's typically pretty loud in here, but that's typical of most bars in Madison."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the Flying Hound. It's close to my home (always a plus when writing reviews) and such a fun little bar, but with great food. You can't go wrong with any of the beer choices (there are so many!) and the food options are great for such a small space. The bar is dimly lit but that gives it a cozy feel, so of course I opted for the french onion soup. It was the perfect choice for a fall day! It was loaded with croutons and provolone cheese, and didn't disappoint on the amount of onion. Paired with a delicious beer, it was the perfect treat for a chilly day!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!  I've had there salmon and bangers with mash. Both were fresh and tasety! Huge beer selection and some nice wines. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent staff and service 
This is one of a very few places in Madison where you can find a Triple Karmelait beer on tap and Key Lime pie"}
{"text":"Crowded, loud and highly over-rated.  Food was way too salty on 2 different entrees causing us to awake in the middle of the night and consume a large glass of water.
Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"The menu looked decent but the food itself was below average.  Service was below average,  with long waits and forgotten items.  Beer selection was decent.  Overall,  there are much better places to dine & drink.  I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"The Flying Hound has a great atmosphere, but the food has left something to be desired each occasion I have been there. 

My recommendation is to head to the Flying Hound for a round and some appetizers."}
{"text":"We were excited to have a new restaurant open in our neighborhood. Outstanding selection of craft beers, great bar, awesome selection of Scotches and Whiskeys. The food is amazing. I had the Atomic Sausage sandwich made with Pelicaric family sausage and house hot pepper mustard. Loved it! My wife had the patty melt, made special by their roasted garlic spread. My son had the spicy citrus chicken sandwich, another great surprise. All three dishes had welcome twists on otherwise traditional sandwiches.  I had a triple Belgian and my wife had a sour ale, both were wonderful. The service was outstanding, thanks to Jameson who was tending bar. We will definitely be back and encourage neighbors and visitors to try them out!"}
{"text":"We popped in for a Friday night Fish Fry.  6 of us arrived at 8 and were promptly seated.  They have a tremendous tap selection and the servers know their beers. Our waitress was well versed in the selection and was passionate about making sure we ordered the exact beer we were looking for.  I hate it when a server doesn't know the selection or seems annoyed when you ask questions about specific brews. Extra stars for service!

All in all, the place is solid.  There really isn't much close competition so they kinda have a monopoly on the craft beer and decent food scene.  During happy hour it gets SUPER packed. Show up a little later and you should find a spot for a pint."}
{"text":"Yes, they have a large tap list, but that list gives no indication as to what size of beer you are ordering, just a type and a price. If everything came in pints, this would be fine, but when I was expecting a pint and got a half instead, suddenly the $5.5 price tag didn't seem so great.

Furthermore the food is overpriced. I ordered the $15 bangers and mash, and received two tough, dry sausages and about 1.5 cups of potatoes with a thick gravy that barely did anything to moisten my food. 

The decor is nice, but I'm not coming back here of my own choice"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service! 
I travel most weeks so I eat out often. This was one of the most unique and tasty I've had in quite a while. I started with the Kilimanjaro Chicken appetizer. You would categorize it as \"hot wings\" or \"Buffalo chicken\" but it is not typical. So crispy because of the flash frying at the end after low-temp, long-time oven roasting. Flavor of the meat really comes through since its oven roasted. Crispy skin so crunchy and good!  The heat of the sauce was spot-on; hot enough for heat-freaks, but enough flavor for those who like a balance of spicy piquancy and taste. 3 small thighs and small legs. Just the right sizes for appetizers. Highly recommended. 
Schnitzel sandwich really good.  Good bread and pork cooked just right without being overdone and overly dry. Good bread. Try the thin slice sweet potato fries. :-)
Nice selection of microbrews and local, regional beers and ales.
Kate and Nicole were really hustling and provided great service.
Come try and enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"I just ate here with my family and oh my goodness was I impressed! Our server, Liz L., was outstanding. She was personable, friendly, helpful, and incredibly knowledgeable not only about the food but about beer selections and styles. 

My fiancé and I shared the mussels special and the salmon special. Both were expertly prepared. The broth for the mussels had incredible depth of flavor and you could tell the mussels were quite fresh (as was confirmed by Liz). The salmon was cooked to a perfect medium temperature and served over a bed of braised kale. I was drinking Spotted Cow but Liz helped my fiancé find a really delicious Belgian beer he'd never tried before.

I could see eating here very regularly if we lived in town. As it stands we live in Chicago so we'll have to make it our watering hole for our visits back home.

A+++"}
{"text":"Great selection of on tap beers.  Good European pub atmosphere and variety of pub food from different countries, but overall I felt the food was just okay.  I'd go back for  a beer if I'm in the area, but I'd pick another spot if I'm hungry.  

When it's busy the parking is a mess and you can expect to end up in the lot by target and crossing traffic to get to the door."}
{"text":"I like the vibe here!  Nice to have them in the Fitchburg neighborhood.  They seem to have good drink  selections.  I had a delicious ham and cheese sandwich! Looking forward to going back when they're not crazy busy."}
{"text":"Upon arrival we were immediately greeted and seated. For a Monday evening, it was fairly full. We ordered desert curds for an appetizer  French onion soup, the mussels entree,  and a schnitzel sandwich. 

I (we) would not recommend the cheese curds. When the order arrived, it was full of very small pieces approximately the size off a marble. Definitely not a good value for the price. The French onion soup, in the other hand, was absolutely delicious and worth trying. The schnitzel sandwich was excellent and a generous portion. The mussels were served in a flavorful sauce, and again as a generous portion. However they were a bit 'dirty' tasting.

Overall we were satisfied with the dining experience and will definitely be returning. We're looking forward to sampling some of the many brews offered."}
{"text":"We had been driving all day and were craving a drink and a bite to eat. I first ordered a Maker's Mark and a ginger ale, the guy said okay......but will ginger beer do as a substitute for the ginger ale. No it won't I said. I told him you could substitute sprite with a splash of coke. Okay he said.......but will a Sierra mist and Pepsi do? No I said, nevermind I will find a beer I like. I  cannot believe a bar has no ginger ale, coke, or sprite. What a crock.
So I ordered a wheat beer, my wife the watermelon gose and she had the salad and I had the fish and chips. We also had the poutine as an appetizer. The food was pretty good, the place was really loud. You couldn't really talk to one another it was so loud. I don't think we would have any reason to go back, not a great experience."}
{"text":"The good: A strong, albeit limited, semi-German menu. Great pretzels and poutine and good beer on tap. 

The bad: Service was inconsistent after we were served the wrong beers and the bartender couldn't figure out what was on tap. The French onion soup and grilled cheese were average and the sweet potato fries were soggy.

The verdict: Stick to the small bites and beers."}
{"text":"This bar/ restaurant is......o.k.   We stopped on a Thursday
 evening, early.  The flying hound burger looked great but was a disappointment.  Dry, and while piled high with stuff, when the fried egg is the star there's something wrong.  Also ordered the mussels.  These were good, broth on them was light but with great flavor.  I appreciated that they toasted the bread but didn't feel the need to slather it up with butter before doing so.  this allowed it to be used to soak up the flavor at the bottom of the mussel bowl.  Both entrees came with fries....big disappointment also.  While the chance at really great fires was there.........please don't serve something that is wrinkled and hard from being under the heat lamp for to long.  Pre cooking seems to be the problem with his place.  Food service was so fast we really didn't have a chance to enjoy our drinks (which were good).  Please make my food fresh as it is ordered.  I would rather wait a few minutes more than be served sub par food.  Will not go back again."}
{"text":"When The Flying Hound first opened, I was excited to try it. Granted, it seems like Madison is teeming with similar restaurants (Great Dane, The Vintage, etc.), but this one is closer to home and in an area that could really use some great restaurants.

Unfortunately, The Flying Hound has not been what I hoped for.

The food was... meh. I had the Friday Fish Fry and found the fish overdone and the fries were very bland. My husband had some sort of brat/sausage that was presented very strangely and was also overdone.

We also had terrible, terrible service. Sure, it's a busy place, but I expect an offer for a refill on my soda, or at least no attitude when I have to flag down a server to ask for it. It was also loud enough to make conversation difficult. 

Between the food and the service, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food, beer selection and great atmosphere! Service was alright, she was a nice woman but seemed a little out of it. I had the schnitzel, one friend had a burger and another had the fish fry, we all enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"Stopped here with the wife for a quick bite to eat and a beer (or two.)

Prices: Reasonable.
Food: Good.
Beer Selection: Excellent.

I found absolutely nothing unreasonably priced and the food was excellent. I will be back in the future. Also, some of the beer (or cider) selections come in a different glass than a pint (depending on alcohol content, I'm sure) so if you're concerned you won't be getting a full pint of whatever brew you order, simply ask the server who will tell you what size glass it comes in.

Very easy.

The hound is becoming my choice for a hangout spot after work or just whenever I feel like having a beer. With good food and an ever-changing beer selection the wife and I will be frequenting."}
{"text":"This place is really exactly as many people have said, solid.  The menu is sparse but seriously they had me at Bacon on a Stick.    I had to refrain from ordering a second one to go.  Three amazing thick bacon slices in a bourbon sauce that was like heaven on a stick.  The slaw that it arrived on was just meh, too dry.... not bad tasting,  but omg the bacon!  We had a jalapeño blue cheese burger that the kitchen sent out to an exact medium rare, which sounds much easier to do than it apparently is in this town.  And the pulled pork sandwich was phenomenal. Apple and jalapeño in the perfect proportion with cheddar cheese.  The side salad greens were also high quality and we were pleasantly surprised given that the place appears to be geared more toward their beer selection.

The service was fast and friendly as was the manager or whomever he was that stopped by twice to make sure we were happy with everything.  My only complaint is that it was a bit too loud, but it was during the Sunday March Madness Badgers game so I gave them a pass on that.  It does echo a lot though in there.

We stopped in on a whim because a place we wanted to try was closed.  Certainly glad we did!"}
{"text":"We have been to the Flying Hound four times -twice for meals and twice for drinks. It's one of those places that you always leave saying, \"why don't we come here more often!?\"

The atmosphere is great. Very clean inside and a spacious patio with a fire pit for chilly evenings. Big bar to sit at and both bar tables and booths for different dining experiences. Every time my husband and I have gone there has been different beers on tap, and we always find something we like!

The food is awesome. We have eaten off the Regular menu (good burgers) and have had the fish fry. It was one of the few fish fries in town that didn't leave me in a grease coma afterward, which was much appreciated. The French fries are delicious. It's not even like they have special seasoning, they are just really really good. 

The service has always been quick and friendly, and as we found on our last trip, extremely flexible. We ran into friends and the staff was great about us drinking together, eating apart, and then rejoining as a group for after dinner drinks. It is a bit pricey compared to similar spots on the West side,but the experience and quality makes it worth it."}
{"text":"This place just opened up and I can tell you it's going to become a regular place for me and my friends.  

For a just starting little gastropub, the food is really good.  Definitely need to try the pretzels with the three mustards and the cheese curds would rival most places in Madison.

For my main sandwich I've only gotten their signature Flying Hound Burger.  There's something about a runny fried egg on a burger that's so amazing.  They also have a really incredible spicy jalapeno remoulade of some sort on it that I can't get enough of it.  Next time I'm going to ask for a side of it to dip my fries in!

You really need to check this place out.  The wait staff are really attentive and you get this 'Cheers' vibe that if you go enough the people are going to know you and be your friends."}
{"text":"Considering it's in a strip mall in the parking lot of a Super Target, I entered The Flying Hound with low expectations. But hunger and a crunch for time will make any place worthy of a try. Quite honestly, a stop at the Target food counter would've been more satisfying (albeit more shameful). The interior is decorated with some World Market prints and beer signs to make it feel like a faux pub. A thin veneer without anything to show underneath it. This carries forward to the food. The \"signature\" (their words) pork schnitzel sandwich was completely underwhelming. Evidently they lost the \"pounded thin\" aspect of schnitzel in translation. What I received was basically a breaded boneless pork chop accompanied with a slice of halfway melted muenster cheese and wilted arugula. The house onion gravy that accompanied it was separated by the time it came tableside. The sandwich was completely devoid of any flavor.  My daughter went with the grilled cheese. On paper, a combo of muenster and cheddar with a roasted garlic spread sounds solid, but sadly this isn't paper and the sandwich was nothing to write home about. The accompanying fries were undersalted and bland. 
Yes, I know that the under represented southwest side of Madison is in need of a regular \"go-to\" place for good drink and food. There isn't much around nearby and they are desperately in need. But sadly, The Flying Hound comes nowhere close to delivering  They are counting on convenience of proximity to bring in the crowds. This might work for awhile but it's not a recipe for long term success."}
{"text":"We went last Sunday around 12:30, the food was okay. I had the chicken tenders and my wife had the patty melt. We both had fries. The fries were really greasy and the patty melt was flavorless with the meat lacking moisture. The chicken tenders were moist and crunchy, we liked them the best. I think we will give it a few months and then try again. Service was slow for it not being busy at all. I was a little annoyed because one server dropped a fork on my wife's head, yes it was an accident but something more than a quick apology would have been nice."}
{"text":"Good convo with the bartender...knows his sports.  The blue cheese-jalapeno  burger was tasty, yet was missing the heat that I was expecting with the jalapenos.  Loved the view of the tvs.  Should be a nice game-day viewing venue."}
{"text":"Always have a pleasant experience here. Service is great and consistent. I recommend the Houndstooth drink!"}
{"text":"I love the location (off the beaten path, but still near civilization), the decor and ambiance is very nice, and the food is adequate.

The space is pretty large, but is broken up nicely so you don't feel like you are in a big open room. I've had great service both times I've visited. The menu may be short, but its also pretty diverse. 

What I tried:
Giant pretzel with mustard- served with like 4 different mustards and the pretzel is soft and very dark, like twice as dark as a normal pretzel. It's very good for sharing, which is what I did.

Steakhouse burger (with a veggie burger)- Couple of pointers. Ask for the sauce on the side. They liberally applied the steak sauce which really overwhelmed everything. Also, hard pass on the veggie burger. It was very mushy and generally lacked flavor. Although, it may have just been bland up against the lake of steak sauce. Aside from all that, this one has promise."}
{"text":"My wife and son took me to Flying hound for Father's Day dinner. I had been before so I had some experience there. First of all, it's a neat little establishment tucked in the corner of a strip mall near the Target shopping center in Fitchburg.  But, don't let that discourage you. This is a great place to hang with family and friends, they have a great beer menu and the food is good as well. 

I had the chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was good without being too filling or messy. The chicken was done well so there was no rubberiness to it. But, the highlight was the sweet potato fries. I fell in love with sweet potato fries while living in SC for 4 years. I have ordered them in other places but they just haven't been the same until Flying Hound. The fries were fantastic with great taste. 

The only negative I would say, and it's not a big one, is that the prices tend to be on the higher side than you might expect. I chalk that up to being in Madison and the trend for Madison establishments to start creeping up prices. 

Overall it was a great, relaxed place to have a casual dinner with my family and wind down the weekend."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great beer selection, great food, and great atmosphere. Glad to have this place in Fitchburg, just what this area needed."}
{"text":"The Flying Hound is a pretty good spot. We stopped in on a Saturday night after calling ahead to see if there was much of a wait since we'd be arriving about 7:30 and they let us know there was none at all. 

The interior is dim and has a warmth about it - it's definitely a place you could sit and chat over drinks for a couple hours. They have a large beer list and are happy to let you taste before buying - in this case I opted to sample both of the nitro chocolate stouts on tap to see which I liked better. Ironically, the double chocolate was the less chocolatey of the two, so I'm glad I tried both. 

For dinner I was between the Spicy Citrus Chicken Sandwich and the Pulled Pork Sandwich. I asked the server for her preference and she strongly in the chicken sandwich camp so I went with it. I opted to upgrade to the sweet potato fries for an extra $1.50 - not something I usually do as a cheapskate, but the whole plate came out to $10.50, which is still on the lower side for a sandwich and fries. 

The upgrade was worth it - my sandwich came out with a huge mound of shoestring sweet potato fries that were quite delicious. As someone who would happily eat fries multiple times a day every day (and, on this occasion, someone who hadn't eaten since breakfast that morning), I appreciated the generous serving. 

The sandwich was okay. The bun was good, the arugula and tomatoes fresh, and the parmesan peppercorn dressing was fantastic. The chicken itself didn't really do it for me, though. I liked that it had some heat, but the sourness of the citrus (still not sure what particular fruit was providing the flavoring) didn't quite mesh with spice blend for me. It also didn't help that my first bite of the chicken was crunchy gristle/tendon/whatever - it seems super common to get that weird bite in chicken breast sandwiches, I don't understand why chefs don't just lob that chunk off as part of normal prep. Do people actually like that part? Am I in the minority? 

Even though the sandwich didn't hit the spot for my taste buds, I'll be back to try the pulled pork and see if that's more up my alley."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, it looked so promising. The service is decent. The décor was cool. The food is of terrible quality.

I got the portobello burger. The portobello cap was cooked well enough, but the bun was dry as hell. I gave up on the bun after two bites and just ate the portobello and toppings. Speaking of which, they don't give you much for toppings. So when that menu says that something is \"topped with\", they mean that they give you a sample for half your order. The fries they gave me were obviously the last of the basket short stubby bits and as such were poorly cooked. I couldn't believe that they would actually serve that to someone. 

Thankfully they have at least one thing that can help to cover up their awful food. Their beer selection is very good (if you can manage to find a beer that they haven't run out of), so get enough beer to dull your taste buds."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw that they were building what looked to be a nicer restaurant in this area because the selections around here are so sparse.  This place is in the same plaza as Target and a few other small shops so for me it's not out of the way as I find myself in that plaza pretty often.  It also has ample parking which is great!

I have now been here three times.  On my second visit, about a week or so after they opened, it was so busy that we pretty much couldn't get in.  The wait was about 1.5 hours which was a bit more than I could bear that night.

My first and third visits however were great so I will definitely be adding this place to the rotation. The place has a great beer selection; not a beer person too much but I saw the list and it was LONG!! The service so far has also been pretty outstanding.  On one visit my fries were burned. After mentioning this to the server, he said that he would take 50% off.  I thought that was pretty cool!

In regard to the food it is not best ever but there are several things I have yet to try so I'm optimistic. I do however LOVE the pretzels here.  You get three medium sized pretzels and three dipping sauces. The pretzels are super soft and the dipping sauces have great flavor!  I also enjoyed the gravy that is served with the poutine.  It was a bit odd that the gravy was served on the side but I still enjoyed them!  I had the mussels also but probably won't be ordering those again as they tasted a bit dirty but the sauce it came in was pretty decent.

All in all, I really dig this place and with so few options in the area I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Great location.  Terrible service...    

Bartender was so rude when asked for food after 'serving' hours.  

I would not recommend after 10pm."}
{"text":"The salads here are delicious! Also, there is a patio with a fire pit and, inside, there are cute bartenders. Need I say more? They also have a great selection of locally brewed beers. I will return!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it's definitely a favorite of mine in the neighborhood. If you're in the very west side of Madison, Fitchburg or Verona I would definitely recommend coming here for food and drinks. They have an extensive list of craft beers (from local favorites to California brews) at really good prices. They also have happy hour. Additionally, they've got some delicious chicken strips, burgers and other apps and full meals. It's a great place to grab a drink and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood hangout. The service is always good, great outside seating. One of the best rotating beer lists in town. We always order the French onion soup which is made with a rich beef stock and topped with melted cheesy rye toast. Highly recommended. On Fridays the soup du jour is a creamy clam chowder with big chunks of clam, potatoes in a luxurious cream soup. It's a steal at less than $3.00 a cup.

The appetizers present a meal in itself. The 3 beef sliders are extremely good and make a meal for two with the addition of a side of fries. The fries are the best in town and are only $2.50 as a side.

The pork quesadilla appetizer is excellent. Actually I've never been disappointed with any of the food. Portions are generous and the burgers are big enough for sharing.


For a consistently reliable, albeit, limited menu, you can't go wrong visiting the Flying Hound."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would! I've always had great experiences here and have been here multiple times but tonight was the last night I'll be coming for food or drinks! A new bartender who I have never seen approached our table after my friend had two drinks that were made with tonic water instead of soda water, two very different flavors. She told us she has been in the service industry for 20 years and knows the difference! Is she has really been in the service industry we would not have been attacked and insulted by her. When we told her she was being offensive her response was \"I'm from the Bronx, we alway sound angry!\" Well her rude behavior and insults will keep me from being back, there are too many other great places to grab an after work drink!"}
{"text":"Okay food. Very weak drinks. I've had to ask for an extra shot of booze just so I can taste it. If I order a brandy old fashioned, it should be red in color. 
At least that's what all the other kids are doing."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once, but the bar keeps me coming back. Aesthetically, it is nice to look at and pretty comfortable to sit around and watch a basketball game. Similarly important is the amount of tap beer on hand (which changes frequently) and the very good cocktails in their menu."}
{"text":"Sure, you come for the beer but you'll keep coming back for the friendly service and the tasty food!  The staff must enjoy working there, because everyone is genuine and friendly - they listen.  They are ready with great suggestions.  And they'll let you taste their beers before you decide - I know that any decent bar will do that, but they seem to be happy about it.

You won't get your typical bar food here (although they probably have best burger around), but the creative menu is accessible for any palate.

If you are in for bar food, their chicken nachos are wildly decadent with both a shredded cheese blend and a queso sauce layered into the chips - with tasty chicken and crisp jalapenos.  It's definitely enough to share for 2-4 people.  They do cheese curds right, as well.

My favorite app is the Kilimanjaro Chicken - which are roasted legs and thighs tossed in a sauce that has it's roots in medium buffalo sauce but take a definite Indian Curry left turn.  A great combination, served with avocado ranch.

For meals, their specials never disappoint and often fit the theme of the day or season (and yes, they have a popular Friday Fish Fry).  We are particular to their salmon entree, which is a perfectly prepared filet served on braised kale, painted with a tangy cream sauce and roasted potatoes.  Fresh, healthy, tasty, and a treat to order in a tavern.

Highly recommended, and has become a family favorite."}
{"text":"I have been to The Flying Hound twice. Both times we were seated right away. The food is very good. The first time I had a burger and the second time I had fish and chips. The decor is pleasant and I imagine the patio will be a great spot to have a beer once it warms up some. 

The only downside that I can see is the service. The food was slow to come out both times I was there. The first visit we had a very nice waitress the second time our server was not very friendly. 

I have really high hopes for this place. Maybe over time the service kinks will be worked through. It is a nice addition to the Fitchburg restaurant scene."}
{"text":"The owners of the Free House in Middleton took the same concept and put an English flavor on it and nailed it on the west side of Madison.   Great beers, and food.  This will be my new West side hang out@"}
{"text":"Very friendly gastropub.  Great assortment of food (some quite unique). Extensive local and world-wide tap beer selection.  Outdoor seating available for those nice days."}
{"text":"We wanted to check out this happy hour. It's $1 off drinks at the bar. Unfortunately, no food deals during happy hour. You should think about some food offerings for your happy hour and the drink specials are not that great either. We got nachos and wanted a second side of salsa (they charge an extra $1 for more salsa). One plate of nachos and 4 drinks and it was $50 for happy hour. The drinks and nachos were ok, not exceptional.

FYI, the only thing listed on the website is:
Happy Hour 4-6pm Monday-Friday
**There is no indication of Happy Hour pricing and/or what is included during the Happy Hour (cocktails, beer, food, etc)
Most customers would like to know what is being offered before they get to an establishment. And a lot of customers look at a website before making their selection of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Having dined at the Flying Hound quite a few times I would say it is definitely a solid choice. The atmosphere does have a very hip vibe to it. At any time they have 20 plus taps that rotate. This creates a nice selection and something new every time you stop in. 

Most recently I went with some friends on a Friday night. It was nice outside so we sat on the patio. Our server was not the most friendliest, but every other time we have been here the service has been good. She may have just been having a bad night.

For drinks I got a cider that was on tap, and my fiance got an old fashioned. The cider was a good patio sipper, nice and refreshing on a hot day. The old fashion was well made as well. 

For food I was feeling ambitious and got the barbecue chicken. I soon realized this was way to much food for me. It was a half chicken with coleslaw and choice of side. For the side I opted for a cup of there home made clam chowder. 

The soup was delicious and rich with big pieces of clam in it. The chicken was also very good it was just a huge portion for me. Usually I opt for a sandwich, wrap or salad. The sauce had a good spice to it and the meat itself was cooked but still juicy. 

Overall the flying hound has some very good pub food that has been up scaled. Its a nice local restaurant that you can count on for a good meal."}
{"text":"GREAT food and a pretty good beer selection. The place was clean and most of the staff were pretty good; I'm not a huge fan of staff eating while serving me. I was in Verona on business and ate here a couple of times and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Always good beer and really good chx nachos!! Love that the beer menu has the % listed! They'll let u have samples of anything before u actually commit to a big glass. Classy place but not too classy to go in a pair of jeans with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish fry - and I've tried 5-6 in the Madison/Middleton vicinity. They don't take reservations so either plan to get there early or be prepared to wait a little bit - food came out relatively quickly - but maybe because we were early. Poutine seemed good (very large dish for one person, and this is coming from me where \"large\" is usually way too much for others) - but I don't have a reference since it was my first. The fish fry was tasty and juicy (cod and perch). I would plan to go again."}
{"text":"I've been to the flying hound three times now and I've never been all that impressed. There is nothing on the menu that really wows me; its a pretty small menu. Went for brunch this past weekend and was even less impressed with the brunch menu. Most places have some lunch items on their brunch menu but they didn't. I ended up ordering french toast (even though I really wanted a lunch dish) which was pretty blah and basic. I could've made better at home."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and wonderful food, great place for that Friday night dinner. Ordered a burger for myself and it was amazing and my significant other ordered the fish and loved it. This place was priced quite reasonable as well."}
{"text":"My friends went to an event in Fitchburg (Verona/PD area) and we wanted a bite to eat.  All I could think about was chain restaurants.  My friend who lives in this general area said let's go to the Flying Hound.  I was down because I like to try new places.  I don't remember if I didn't know about this place or if I didn't know where it was.  Anyway, it is a refreshing choice from the very familiar other choices near the Fitchburg Target.  A place to get a hand crafted meal and good drinks.

From the outside it looks like a small store front in a strip mall.  But it was very spacious inside and there was outside patio sitting, as well.  Service was good.  I enjoyed my quesadilla but it was a bit hot.  I think I would ask for the jalapeño peppers to be kept off or add more sour cream.  My friends dinners looked good too.  I will try it again in the near future."}
{"text":"The service here is consistently great.  We usually sit at the bar.  Their drink selection is bomb all around.  Their food was a bit meh at first but their clam chowder and nachos are SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and environment!  The German theme and art is enjoyable! 
Fish fry is good,  could have used a little more fish and a little less frys...
Lots of beer on tap and scotch to choose from :)
Didn't sit outside tonight,  but know it's a great patio from past experience.

P.s. dint drink the Irish cider"}
{"text":"I believe (my opinion) is they have the best fish fry in town.   I normally hit a different place each Friday...I came upon this location to meet family.  I ended up choosing the fish fry and since then, I only come here now then anywhere else on Friday's."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu of food but most importantly an impressive and diverse beer menu. They had taps from around the world as well as local microbrews. Lots of parking nearby and TV's inside so you can watch whichever sporting event is on. While it is a bar, I wouldn't hesitate to bring a date or even an older family here. There is something for everyone except maybe kids."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed. Just ate there with my family and due to how small the place is along with the high, open ceilings and the fact that the dining area is not separated from the bar, it was a real struggle to hear each other. Drunk people were screaming in the bar which carried right through the entire place. Definitely not a place to go for decent conversation.

The food was mediocre, too. I ordered the salmon entree topped with a dill cream sauce that came with diced potatoes and kale mixed with sweet onions. It tasted great but the dill sauce was way, WAY too salty, to the point that I could barely finish the salmon (I had to scrape it off), and couldn't finish the kale. My mother had a veggie burger and the patty tasted like it was molded together from turkey stuffing, which did not taste good on a cheeseburger. My father had the prime rib and said it was just \"ok\" even though the server raved about it more than once. 

I would not go back to the Flying Hound for a meal, but would only consider it for a couple drinks to watch a game. Even then it probably wouldn't be one of my first choices, as the place is extremely small so it fills up quickly. I think I'll stick with the Dane or Vintage west."}
{"text":"Giving it 3 stars because we've only been here once and we sat at the bar. My husband really enjoys beer so he wanted to try this place out. I'm not very keen on this area as its really built up now and crowded.

It wasn't very busy and I wasn't thrilled with how the dining area was set up, it was a little to open for my preference. The bartenders were ok but they seemed more interested to talk to each other. I tried the poutine mostly because because I love poutine. I don't mind different versions or takes on poutine: beef gravy, mushroom gravy, fried or non fried cheese curds, bacon, etc. This version just lacked flavor and not enough gravy. I had to ask for more and it was too think and lumpy and very bland. Either not made properly or possibility from a can or jar. I'm sure this place will do fine, lots of growth going on in this part of Madison. But we probably won't be coming back here. There are other solid dining spots in Madison with good beer and food without having to head into this over commercialized area of Fitchburg/Madison."}
{"text":"A quality establishment along the lines of the Great Dane. A nice selection of beers, appetizers, burgers, bar food, and several other entree options. Plus they have a nice variety of salads! The patty melt was delicious."}
{"text":"Update:  After coming back here several times, Flying Hound feels more like a 3.5 star kind of place. 

This place has a cool pub atmosphere and nice artwork.  It's a nice restaurant and bar scene.  The burgers and sweet potato fries are very good. 

Downside:
- It's very loud and can be pretty crowded.  Sometimes it is hard to carry on a conversation due to loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday night about 5:30. The place was already packed, but our party of 5 was seated immediately. Our waitress and waiter in training were great, there seemed to be a lot of staff for the size of the place. There is also a patio that you could sit on, but no service on this night. The interior is small but nice, notice the beautiful stain glass flying hound above the door. We ordered beers that came out promptly (there is quite a list!) and then 2 perch dinners, a cod dinner, a patty melt, and an atomic sausage all with fries. Our food was also delivered promptly and was above average. Impressed on all the local ingredients used on their menu. Just a few negatives - hard to have a conversation because of the acoustics. It was also very cold, not sure if this was an A/C vent or the door opening and closing to the patio. Cole slaw served with fish pretty blah, none of us ate it. Other than that an enjoyable experience and we will definitely return. Previous reviewers that had poor service should give it another try. Oh, and they kept my water glass full, always a good thing for me."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) seriously awesome service
2) gluten free friendly drinks and food
3) nice ambience

I seriously do not have enough good things to say about this place! Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch around 2pm and there were a decent amount of people there. I really liked the atmosphere, wood floors and big windows all over. We were seated right away and our server, Alora, came over immediately with menus. She walked me through all of the gluten free drink and food options on the menu and brought waters right away. Gluten free bread and buns are available as well as a few salads. In addition to the gluten free food options there are several gluten free beers, a cider on tap, and a pear cider in a bottle. I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich with french onion soup (no croutons!) and a pear cider. My boyfriend got a beer (they have over 30 on tap!) and the ham and cheese sandwich. Our server was great about refilling our waters and giving us updates on when our food would be out. My sandwich was awesome, all of the veggies tasted really fresh and my soup was piping hot. My boyfriend said his ham and cheese and fries were great as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The four stars is simply because the beer here is excellent, but the food some what lacks in some aspects (both portions and taste). I've been here twice and the service is really quick. I definitely recommend to at least try some of the beers they have on tap (it's not made in house)."}
