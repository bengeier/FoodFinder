{"text":"Very friendly place to stop by the food is great seems to be a place for the locals to stop in. That tells a lot."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a burger once. We were told by someone to come here for \"the best burger in town.\" 

I felt like I had some kind of practical joke played on me. Not only was it one of the worst burgers I ever had, but we waited an hour or so for our food.

Then people laughed at us when I tried to pay with a debit card. You have to use their ATM to get cash to pay for your food.

If you know the owner and just want a bar to get drunk in, come here. If you actually care about eating food, go to the caf√© in town."}
{"text":"This is a bar that serves breakfast.  Real hash browns perfectly cooked. Eggs were also great and they had great rye toast. This place is gem. Best breakfast we had in two weeks of travel."}
{"text":"OMG, best burgers! 
This is a quaint little small town bar with limited seating in front and lots of extra seating in back.
Burger was truly amazing"}
{"text":"\"This is THE best burger ever!\"

That is a quote from my 10 year old niece Annika, burger connoisseur. She has been eating full size hamburgers since she was 5 - it's her go to whenever we are out to eat. The question is always, \"It is as good as J & M?\" and up until now, no burger has surpassed."}
{"text":"Great place to stop. One of the best burgers i have had in a long time. Also on mondays the have monday night breakfast."}
{"text":"Get the burger. I'll come back for breakfast, but the burger is fantastic. My girlfriend would say the bun fails to hold up the juicy beef, but I think these are the food problems to have. The steak seasoning makes it. You don't have to order a temperature - it will come out perfectly soft-but-not-scary. Decent taps too. The broccoli poppers are missing something though. Who cares. Burgers."}
