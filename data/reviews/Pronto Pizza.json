{"text":"Solid. I recommend delivery as I have actually never set foot inside the place. However, I have had delivery now several times and been satisfied every time. I order the Super Pack for 25 bucks and feed 7+ people. A baked Ziti (really good) 2 large pizzas (really good) 2L of Soda and 20 Wings (not as good). Thats a lot of food for 25 dollars."}
{"text":"Make sure that they are Open first! Stopped by the day before Thanksgiving, the day after, and the day after that. Had to buy the Chicken Parm sandwich as my third choice, since my first two options they were out of! Not sure how long in this world this place will be here, I wish them the best"}
{"text":"Avoid if at all possible. Not worth your time, $, or caloric intake."}
{"text":"The only thing I have tried from this restaurant is the pizza and ziti. Pizza was very bland, but not inedible. The baked ziti was absolutely terrible, dry and had no flavor whatsoever. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away."}
{"text":"Let's start with the bad. REALLY slow. I dined in once and it took over an hour before we could leave. The waitress told us the cooks were being lazy because of a previous rush of deliveries. She also told us that the owners put far more weight into the deleveries than they do those who are dinning in and waiting. This seems backwards. If I have to wait on something I would rather be in the comfort of my own home.  We had gotten up and put our coats on when the food finally arrived. Our waitress was far too forthcoming with the issues with the restaurant and the owners. We know that the owners are great with Italian food because they're from Egypt... Wait... What? I don't think that waitress works there anymore.  Now the conundrum of the food: The lazagne was interesting. It had way too much liquid in it and I was ready for a horrible meal. I was surprised at the outstanding flavor though. I was ready for the very tasting looking garlic knots. Again, looks are deceiving. They were obviously bought in a can or the freezer section and they were over cooked. I couldn't even eat one. The waitress said that the good bread sells out early so they then bake this other stuff. Personally, I think they just go next door to food lion and grab it out of the freezer.  My wife got the philly cheese steak, which was awesome. It came with fries, which were horrible. I am sure they are frozen.   They have a large selction (although quite a few typos on the menu) They need to reduce the amount on the menu, fix the side items, and pay a little more attention to the people seated in the restaurant.  Our solution: What we do now is call ahead to get philly cheese steaks (it takes about 20 minutes for them to be ready) and go pick it up. After several attempts with the fries, we just don't bother anymore."}
{"text":"The problem with the Charlotte area as a whole is that there is not a lot of variety when it comes to eating out. Sure, if you just moved here, you will have some options. But if you've lived here for any length of time, you will inevitably start recalling what the place used to be previously, maybe even a time or two before then.  On the good side, I have no idea what this used to be, because I believe that the center is relatively new, and thus has had no prior tenants. That is a good thing. On the bad, it's a bit out of our normal area of travel, but we were there, so decided to stop. Also, as has been previously mentioned, the service was on the slow side.  When it comes to the food, however, it was a solid meal for a perfectly reasonable price and the staff was friendly in the process. But since they are out of the way, we may not make our way there in the future."}
