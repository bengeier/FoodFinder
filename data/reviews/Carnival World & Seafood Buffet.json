{"text":"This used to be the best buffet in Las Vegas, by far. I've visited this buffet at 11:30 on a Saturday, expecting to have an awesome sushi selection for lunch. It was $34.95 for this buffet, and the only sushi on the buffet were California rolls and vegetable rolls. There used to be Nigiri sushi, and raw salmon and tuna.  The buffet was OK. I would've been satisfied if it had been $9.95, but for $34.95, this buffet was very disappointing. If you are expecting decent sushi, don't come here."}
{"text":"I found the yelp ratings in vegas very unexpected. On one hand, mediocre restraint like Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining can get a 4.5 here with thousands of reviews , while carnival seafood buffet is only getting 3 .  Anyhow, I was a regular to the old seafood buffet, and the new one i thought was as good as the old one if not better. The regular buffet included some seafood (some crab legs as well), but the ones inside the seafood section that requires a $15 buy up is definitely worth it.  No regarding the line..it's always like that on weekends /holidays. So if you want to avoid the wait, either come during weekday, or somehow have vip line access that let you by pass the wait.  I had the vip access card from SPG platinum membership, so we got seated right the way (btw, that vip access is great for the buffet of buffet since all the participating buffets have vip lines, including Cesar - thus you can maximize the buffet pass).  There are two entrances to the buffet, the one closed to the hotel/casino entrance is intended for the regular buffer, and the one further way was intended for the seafood buffet. But in reality, you can use either entrance for the seafood buffet, so pick the one with shorter lines.  The drawback of using the \"regular buffet\" entrance is that you will be seated a bit far away from the seafood section."}
{"text":"This buffet is the epitome of terrible buffets. The \"Asian food\" was far below sub-par, and the seafood section is not open until 3PM. Combined with the ridiculous price per person, this buffet has a lot to be desired. I advise future customers to save their money and visit another buffet."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet. The quality and the service is amazing! 
We bought the 24 hr buffet pass fot 75$ and you can go to 5 different buffets. The food here is really amazing! We will come again for dinner. Free mimosas for the whole table yes please. Ruwaida our server is very sweet and pleasant. She is very attentive and came to our table very often to make sure we are ok! Really large variety of food. We are stuffed"}
{"text":"Went for the seafood buffet. Lobster was extremely small, very disappointing. The grilled prawns were better. I can't say I got my moneys worth.. But I know I will not be going back, at least for the seafood buffet price. The regular buffet was okay. We went at 8:45 and it was just a 15 minute wait."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and a good value.  Chef Terry helped my husband find numerous dishes that met his considerable dietary restrictions. 
Thank you Chef Terry for keeping us safe! we'll be back soon:)"}
{"text":"I saw a roach near the vietnamese noodle section, and let the cook know but she just killed it in front of me without an apology. So gross never going back."}
{"text":"excellent server Roberto Sanchez. anticipated our needs & very helpful ....food good. great shrimp and cracked crab during dinner. dessert selection also great. price is decent for the food selection offered"}
{"text":"Good food with Rude waiters.

The food is really good but the waiter is unprofessional and rude. Be ware of a waiter who claimed to be from San Francisco. This Asian looking old lady kept interrupting my meal with my wife with rude jokes. She surrounded us all the time and kept filling my drink even if I explicitly told her that I dont need more. When we left, she started to ask for more tips even if i have tipped for more than 15%. This person ruined my trip to this hotel and I definitely wont go there any more."}
{"text":"Asked our cab driver for the best seafood buffet and the Rio Carnival Buffet was recommended as the best.  Our party of 6 was extremely disappointed as soon as we saw the seafood spread.  Variety was actually pretty good, but nothing screamed quality.  I would not pay the extra for the seafood if I were to do it again.  The regular buffet was an ok value but there are much better buffets for a few bucks more such as the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood lovers,the service was exceptional.
There were plenty desert options to choose from.Overall a worthy place to stop by !!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money at all. It's more like crappy cafeteria food that you get in high school. Unless you can eat $35 worth of ice cream--which was ok--stay away from it."}
{"text":"Use your time wisely and head elsewhere. Spent 2 hours waiting in line for dinner. The food was horrible!! Things were bland, mushy and just gross!! Disappointed from the very first plate of food. And, the dessert selection wasn't impressive either. Although the gelato was ok. Yes, they offer a wide range of food, but the quality sucks.  Spend your money and time somewhere else more worthwhile."}
{"text":"The Seafood claimed they have lobsters, but the lobsters were so small, smell and tasted rotten.  Their oysters didn't taste fresh either, they tasted stale and old.  The big shrimps in the shell were dried, their textures were like rubbers.  When I asked for a bowl of Pho, the Vietnamese chef asked me if I wanted the yellow noodle for Pho.  Only the tempura, crab legs, fruits and deserts were ok to eat, and they charged us for $48 per person for dinner.
We will never come back to this place again!!!"}
{"text":"***FOR SEAFOOD*** If all you want is crab legs, just get the normal dinner. The extra $20 will get you oysters and lobster. The rest of the buffet was so good! The food is fresh and delicious. Everything was good. My only gripe was that there was only nigiri for sushi, no sashimi. The gelato was the best frozen dessert I've ever had, and I don't even like gelato. I'm most definitely coming back for breakfast."}
{"text":"**Disclaimer, it's been over a year since I've visited this buffet with my mother. However, the service still sticks in my mind clearly to this day. It was outstanding! 

       The Stars of this review are only dedicated to our server Chaiwat. He gave the absolute best service my mother and I have ever experienced.
 
    When in town for a business trip with my family, I decided to treat my mother to dinner here because my mom loves seafood and buffets and I heard such amazing reviews by word of mouth. After not much of a wait, we were sat in Chaiwat's section and were greeted by a friendly man. He took our orders and before we settled on which end of the buffet we should start, he came back with our drinks like the Flash! 

       Unfortunately, the food left us wanting. The Asian food was rather sweet. The crab legs were ok, not bad, but nothing to write home about. (Sidenote: Chaiwat saw that we needed the utensils for the legs and brought those to us before we even had a chance to ask). I, unfortunately, had to stick with the picky-eaters section (chicken nuggets, baked potatoes, and soup section) and the dessert section to get anything worth my money spent there. 

       Chaiwat saved our experience by being the best and the most kind server I've ever had, even to this day, a year and some odd months later. Our drinks were always full, he gave fantastic suggestions and had a great nature.

       Thank you, Chaiwat, for such a memorable experience. :)"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and previous buffets do not have that large of a selection for me. Some friends are in town from Ohio and wanted to try Carnival World. I was hesitant but I went anyway. Chef Terry heard me talking with my friends about limited options and gave me a tour of the buffet and even made me the best vegan meatballs, falafal and deep fried cheese pizza. Incredible service from a buffet chef. I would come back multiple times for his deep fried cheese pizza!"}
{"text":"You buy above a pass for 24 hours and then they tell you that it's extra for the seafood buffet which they widely advertise all the time and I'll till Caesars Palace charges an up charge in addition to the three and it's listed is 49.95 in the elevators but they open on the weekends and holidays to 7995and up though they explain it it still is misleading. The 1 ton soup was mediocre in the egg drop soup was in edible. I definitely won't be going back to do the up charge for seafood buffet after three."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of good tasting food for the price! The Crab legs Hot & cold are so good! Definitely a good choice if your hungry : )
Gelato is excellent!"}
{"text":"\"Seafood Buffet\" Don't waste your money. $34.00 for the buffet PLUS $20.00 if you want an Upgrade to be allowed to eat very small crab legs and knuckles. Trust me NOT WORTH IT!!!!"}
{"text":"Plenty of options. $25 is a bit much for a no-service buffet. And they will want tip, but honestly that's par for the course. Lots of options, and they have gelato. It's probably the best buffet in town, worth the Lyft ride from the Golden Nugget--that buffet has nothing over Rio. 

Be careful, if you have more than 2 plates, and you'll want to, you might end up looking like everyone that's at the buffet. Watch yourself!"}
{"text":"During the holiday season there were 4-hour wait times for the buffets along the strip. So I diverted and had everyone try the one at Rio instead since this was a place my family would typically go to in the past when our agenda was mainly to go skiing outside Vegas and not the fancy buffets. Looks like it's still just as good, with a huge selection, but just without the fancy frills of specialty foods that some people may want at Caesars or the Cosmopolitan. But the price is decent, little wait, and good food."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night. It was just me and I was seated quickly. The waiter Brian came over quickly and was absolutely great. 
I had gotten some crab legs (they were split already) but couldn't find the \"tools\" for them.  I sat down and started to use my fork to get the yummy goodness out, and before I could dispatch the first leg Brain was there, tools in hand, and said \"these should help\".  Talk about paying attention to detail.  
My drink was never empty and my empty plates cleaned up quickly. 
The food was above average (very good) for all you can eat buffets.  The prime rib was so juicy and tender, the crab legs perfect (not water logged), and the sides yummy.  
This was a great experience."}
{"text":"Always have had a pleasant experience at the seafood buffet we look forward to coming but this year the manager Sal went over and above the job. Thank you sir you're the man!!"}
{"text":"This place is really run down  nothing like how I remembered.  Thanks to other reviews we skipped seafood option for $20 more. The \"upgraded\" section looked sorry. The rest of the buffet was horrible as horrible can be.
It was a big mistake to stand in line for this. Do yourself a favor, save your money.
This will be the last time we come anywhere close."}
{"text":"I always ate at Rio buffet as my last meal before leaving vegas. I went with my fiance and they merged the regular and seafood buffet into one location. Went in for dinner and opted for the seafood buffet which was $50/person. The host raved about the options, one of which was KING crab legs... I was sold on the KING crab legs and opted for the seafood upgrade. The seafood options were above average but they had salmon and tuna sashimi. A huge bonus for those of you who don't like filling yourselves with sushi rice at a buffet. When I got to the crab section, I initially wondered where the heck is the KING crab??? I was assured by one of the workers behind the counter that what I was eating was indeed KING crab... After stuffing myself about 80-85%, I went to the other side of the buffet only to find that they had the same \"KING\" crab in the regular buffet. Upset about this, I went back to the seafood buffet and demanded KING crab. The person behind the buffet said, \"oh, I'm sorry... the KING crab legs are all mixed in together with the other crab legs.\" I stare down at the crab only to see the cheaper, show crab... At that point, the person behind the buffet started to dig underneath the cheaper crab and started to bring out the much larger and more expensive \"King\" crab! I was really pissed at this point because the restaurant was intentionally hiding the much more expensive \"KING\" crab underneath all the cheap snow crab legs. Extremely shady and unethical business practice. I ripped the manager a new one and demanded a refund. We were finished eating so received $50 out of the $100 we spent there. If you go for the seafood option, be sure to eat KING crab, and not the other kind."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place only has two and a half stars!! Totally underrated. My family and I bought the 24 hour buffet bracelet and we went to both Paris and Planet Hollywood buffet and it was complete garbage! Service was horrible, there wasn't that big of a selection, and the overall display of the food was sloppy to say the least!

There are so many options at Rio and most importantly the service was on point! Special shout out to Janice and Ofelia for constantly checking up on us and cleaning up all our dirty plates! They were friendly and personable and the food was amazing!
5 stars hands down!!!! Wish you guys were open for breakfast and lunch again!!"}
{"text":"My family really wanted to try the buffet. It pretty expensive to include the seafood option. Total per person was $57. OUCH! The so called highlight would be the lobster. Wrong!  The tails were sliced in random sizes. Some had okay meat and some had slivers. The lobster was a let down. However, the shrimp choices were solid. The prime rib was awful. Extremely tough. The salad bar was like buying a salad bag at Costco. The shrimp choices saved this review from being a one star."}
{"text":"great food and even more on service!   a.k. our waiter, he gaved us a superb service.he needs a promotion or atleast a pay raised!!"}
{"text":"Fresh selection of foods from all around.  Tepenyaki was a hit.  They also serve Pho, duck, tamales and some very flavorful roast beef. Can't forget the fluffy eggwhite omeletes to order. Food is delicious."}
{"text":"I had the buffet of buffet and so far this is the best among the list ( except Bacchanal of course). They have a lot of selection from different regions.
Prime rib is so tender and melts in your mouth. 
Not a lot of desserts but who cares about sugar when you have an overload of Protein and Carbs.
The most important on this review is our server Michelle. Excellent service. She is vey attentive to the needs of the guests. No wonder why she in on the VIP area. Thanks Michelle for the great lunch experience."}
{"text":"For $50 you don't expect the Lobster to be 2 to 3 inches BIG, Don't expect anything from the King Crab legs and the whole place is disgusting, it is so old they need to tear down the whole casino and built a new one."}
{"text":"The Seafood buffet when it was separate was great. They hav combined it with the World buffet.  Its not the same. It was pretty good. But its lost its Great rating. Small section for the seafood. For the price, there should be a lot more options."}
{"text":"Food quality was poor. The food doesn't worth $50. Oster tasted disgusting and not fresh at all. Snow crab was very salty. Save your money and eat else where."}
{"text":"Went to this buffet for Christmas Day lunch, $38.99, was ok. Food was good, but when I grabbed the Korean BBQ short rib, totally under cook, couldn't eat. Waiters were not nice, didn't ask if I wanna get another drink when I finished it. I can understand those ppl who were still working during the Christmas Day, anyway, I was enjoy the food. Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"The worst. Two people for $87! We paid for the seafood upgrade, and regretted it almost immediately. Crab legs that seemed dried out (best way I can put it) and nothing had any flavor to it. Got a second plate, blew off the seafood, decided to go with a tasty looking end cut of prime rib instead. It only looked tasty. Bland, and the quality of that beef.....YUCK! If they raised cattle in Detroit back alleys after getting them hooked on smack and meth while feeding them a diet of lard and feces, then this is what you'd end up with. Stay out of this place, it's NASTY!"}
{"text":"Not at all worth the price.  Paid $43 for 2 people at lunch and that was with a coupon and didn't include the seafood section because it wasn't open for lunch.  There was not a wide variety to choose from and some selections were cold.  Locals get a 25% discount which I just learned from reading other reviews because they don't ask if you're local or advertise there is a discount."}
{"text":"Amazing food even for a Wednesday. On top of that Robert P. was a great waiter. 5 star food and service thanks to Robert. P"}
{"text":"Stood in line on Thanksgiving Day for over an hour, got to the front, paid and started to make our plates! Food looked presentably nice but when we got to our tables...

Dinner sucked big time! I am sorry, my family of 4 was super disappointed! Seafood had absolutely no taste except for freezer burn. Totally not acceptable flavor for the price we paid...Family of 4 bill came out to $255 which is a lot!

In my opinion, they couldn't handle the amount of customers for the special day and possibly had to take out additional food from freezer last minute. Food horrible, service pretty decent for such a busy day!"}
{"text":"I MUST say......I travel a lot & customer service almost EVERY place is terrible for the most part. However I don't have to say that the food at the Rio buffet is excellent that's quite obvious, but today is probably like my 15h time being at the Rio buffet & I ran into a problem for the first time. I had to ask to talk to a manager whose name was Sal Cavalcante today. The problem I was having was to do with the third party company. It was not Rios fault in any way. Sal took it upon himself knowing it was not his company's fault to fix my problem ASAP without me even having to continue finishing my story. He saved us about $40. He gave me no hassle and fix the problem to make us, the customers happy not even content but HAPPY. He was a friendly guy that came to check on us as he did everybody else in the restaurant numerous of times throughout our meal to make sure we were okay. We've been in Vegas for almost 2 weeks now and every single day or night somehow someplace customer service fails us very badly. Sal from the Rio buffet hands down gave us the best customer service through our whole trip. It's our last night here and what a way to end it with 110% PERFECT customer service. Any company should be thrilled to have an employee likes Sal representing their company. I am honestly giving you a tip that if you have any problems at that restaurant .......\"you better call Sal\"
He will be there to help quick and make everything easy. Thank you so much for representing customer service like it should be represented

{"text":"Paid extra for the seafood buffet. Let me tell you something i've been in the food business for a while and you can taste and tell the way the oysters and crabs smelled and tasted like just terrible."}
{"text":"Things have definitely changed.  This place is not like it was before. Stay away. The supposed seafood section is just outright overpriced and horrible. You have to pay extra to get access to the seafood area where a staff ensures you paid for the privilege by checking a fluorescent stamp on your arm. Trust me you don't want that privilege. You get a ticket for ONE teeny, itty bitty, very chewy, over cooked lobster IF YOU CALL IT THAT. ONE!  But you probably won't want a second and spend all that energy getting it opened and find the same rubbery lobster. It's just not worth it. And I wasn't the only one complaining about the quality of food. It has gotten so bad I won't go back even if they halved the price. If this helps any - this is my very first YELP review. Their quality has dropped so precipitously, I felt compelled to write one. I'm retired military and not in my nature to complain because I've eaten worse food but I feel the price of the meal is just not fair. Find out for yourself if you want, it's a free country, in the end it's your hard earned money."}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying at The Rio so we decided to eat here. Took our pic as we came in that was a little strange we thought but later we loved it. Our server Kimberly was very helpful and friendly. We asked about shows and she went and got prices for us and the time it started.  We bought our pic (great pic by the way and good price $20) they did not give us a bag to put it in so she went and got us one and put our pictures in it. We didn't even ask for a bag she just got it on her own. She went above and beyond!! She told us about a 24 hour all you can eat buffet pass to 5 place so we signed up for that.  That saved us some money Sal the manager came over and took care of us on that....they refunded our money and applied our dinner charge to the 24 hour pass. So for ONLY $50 more we got another FULL DAY of meals!!!  I HIGHLY recommend them and ask for Kimberly personally to be your server...she's the best!!! Sal was awesome too!!"}
{"text":"We eat here every time we go to Vegas..my tip is to go to the discounted coupon kiosk kinda by New York New York and we got a great discount on this buffet..definitely go hungry to get ur money worth..never disappointed.."}
{"text":"Paid $103.80 for 2 seafood buffets. Have to say that I'm really disappointed. Food was bland, overcooked and seemed to be sitting out for a while. Crab legs are served in both areas so don't pay the extra $15. Wife and I spit out the sushi rolls. Weird taste. Overall won't be dining here again. Far from the strip and over priced."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit or two while you're here. Seafood add-on is totally worth it. Be sure to check tix4tonight for discounts. And check the free shuttle schedule from Bally's or harrahs."}
{"text":"Not worth the cost of the seafood buffet. Very similar seafood selections, including crab legs and shrimp on their regular buffet and half the price. Disappointed in how they are combined & the cost."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving it an two star is the waitress.    She was kind, sweet, and willing to work.  
     The food...........  ehhhhhhhh.    I think that Burger King has better food.     I went today around Noon.  If I remember right that is lunch time.  The place was dead.      The food was bland... no flavor to the meat.    And the Asian part if you want to call it sushi was a disappointment.     And an 1/2 hot dog on a stick? ???    Ahhhhhh.     I'm a redneck.  but that's in a buffet?  That's trashy.        The fried chicken that they had up there?     KFC has better.              I spent over $60 for 3 people.    I expected better.               

           Rio  if you are reading this.  I am not looking for a free meal.    I just hope you give your cooks a talking to.  Think of this.  Would you treat your family the food that's there.   Especially if they were from out of town that's never been to vegas?"}
{"text":"Robert,was excellent very respectful and very funny.food was very good ,great variety to choose from excellent in my book."}
{"text":"We purchased the seafood buffet.  They did offer some things not offered at the regular buffet.  My husband and I pretty much only ate from the seafood side.  I believe they intentionally do not label the lobster as \"lobster tails\", but as \"lobster medley\".  I have never seen what appeared to be lobster tails as small as these.  They did have 2-3 supersized lobster claws inside the medley, and that is what I got (with a few of the \"tails\").  Overall, the buffet was average, nothing to write home about.  I don't think I would make a point to go out of my way for this buffet.  The lobster and other steamed seafood could have had a bit more flavor and could have been more tender."}
{"text":"Scam......  Eater beware!!!!   Advertised snow crabs but only served small tiny stone crabs.  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OUT THE BUFFET BEFORE YOU PAID.  We were there eating 2 days of the buffets of buffets, two out of two days, no snow crabs.  Only tiny stone crabs!"}
{"text":"AMAZING...  CHIWAT and his sister VIRGIE deserve a gold medal...  Beyond amazing costumer service...  I work in CORPORATE AND COSTUMER SERVICE IS EVERYTHING. I am shocked the way they treated us.  And the food was delicious.  Everyone who has bad reviews is a freaken idiot.  Excuse my French.  I'm speechless to the way they treated us..  We will be back tomorrow...."}
{"text":"I loved it!
Their Asian cuisine tastes real Asian; similarly Mexican & other cuisines.
I will never miss having here in my every next trip to Vegas :-)"}
{"text":"The seafood buffet is a scam!! Do not pay for it! The crab legs and shrimp and most of the seafood can be found in other section of buffet. The cold seafood offered in the overpriced area is meally- the prime rib saved the day and melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"Sucks. 
If you want cafeteria food, save your money and go to Furr's or your local hospital. 

AND DEFINITELY don't spend the extra 20 bucks on the \"unlimited seafood\". Only difference between the two buffets is that you get a dry ass lobster (5 lobster tails)."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to say this but I sadly have to give this place a, \"One Star\" rating. My family and I were so excited to go eat there. We had purchased a Groupon for my mother's birthday and were planning on driving all the way to the RIO Casino to have a family meal. I decided to call the buffet that morning and verify if we were going to be able to use the Groupon and how much it would be for a 3rd person. The individual I spoke with told me,\"Yes, you'll be able to use the Groupon with no extra fee's and it will be 32.99 for the 3rd person after 3pm.\" I was set! I told my family we were good to go and started heading there a couple hours after the call. Once we arrived, it was a nightmare. They told us that if we wanted to use the groupon, we would still have to pay a ridiculous fee for the first 2 people and it would be $40 for the 3rd person. They called the manager, who I don't think even responded, and rudely continued to tell us that if we wanted to come inside we would have to pay up! We instantly walked away and took our business elsewhere with better customer service."}
{"text":"Used to be the best seafood buffet in Vegas. I would say better than Bachanal.... But NOW that they combined the 2 buffet in Rio and charge $49.99, the quality and ambience went way downhill. To the management of Rio corporation, better act fast before every heads turns their interest away from your buffet restaurant. So many competitions out there that I wouldn't be surprise your business will not last long in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went there for my husbands bday with 6 friends... Sal the manager was extremely nice! Our server was a sweetheart & took great care of us! They made our entire experience amazing!! Thank you seafood Buffett staff! Food was amazing & I think we hit a food coma later! Haha"}
{"text":"This buffet has a little of everything. If you're not sure what you want,  this is the perfect buffet for you. 70 for 2 people. They offer unlimited drinks for a few bucks more. Full bar."}
{"text":"Wide selection to choose from, with crab legs to Chinese food and sushi. Love that this place clearly marks Gluten Free on different dishes! Spoke with the manager Sal who was very helpful and nice. My wife and I will return during our stay here Vegas."}
{"text":"Haven't been to the Rio buffet in a couple of years.  Went there last night and boy was I disappointed.  The buffet has really gone downhill. They increased the price and it's not worth the money.  I won't be going back there. Service is terrible and so is the food. Not like it used to be. What happened?"}
{"text":"Talk about a Shit hole ! This Buffet is very disappointing and very very pricey . $ 56.00
for Buffet with seafood . Better Buffet with seafood across town $ 21.99 . Ya its Carnival food all right . All never come back and i wouldn't let my Dog eat this crap . And don't let me get started the Service from the table cleaner checking out my wife to know one getting my baby girl a hi chair . They need to clean House big time at this shit hole . Bye Bye Rio never again 
Las Vegas Local 30 + Years Run away from this place"}
{"text":"Terrible simply terrible Seafood Buffet. The king crab was the size of regular crab and many arms were uncooked. Most of the food was cold. Every other item seemed to have grease galore. The lobster claws were overcooked.  The only good items were the shrimp scampi, California rolls, and a yellowish pasta dish. No fruits other than for squeezing. No desserts. The cigarette smoke coming into the area from the casino irritated my eyes. Should have just bought 4 lbs of King Crab legs at the supermarket and I would have been happier than going to this buffet for $50+ ."}
{"text":"Food was generally of above average quality. Notable standouts were their raspberry tarts, prime rib, and mashed sweet potatoes. Underwhelming fare included their BBQ pork ribs and their \"build your own taco bar\".

This rating and review is not all about food quality, however. The high cost of the buffet accounts for most of the reason for this 3 of 5 star review.

Back in the day you were first seated and drink orders were taken by attendants - who then released you to gather your mountain of *whateverfood*(tm).

Now, they crudely point at the drink machines (a la movie theatre monstro-automated-polysucrose dispensing beasts) and vocalize for you to 'serve yourself your own beverages.'

Higher costs.... lower service (when it is already scraping by at barely minimal). This pretty much sums it up. The wave of the future!

3/5."}
{"text":"I was at this buffet last month on December 29, and also the year before, and from my personal experience this Buffet has not improved their food and service quality. Their food taste pretty old, it taste like the food is being sitting there for a long time or they don't defrost the food before cooking it because sometimes it taste with too much water and therefore loose flavor.  The employees looks like they are tire of working there because they all careless about providing good services.  And it's too pricy for that type of quality. I would not recommend this buffet.  There are better choices in Vegas than this."}
{"text":"I called  in advance about if they could make anything for my son with all his food allergies even though they are a buffet. We brought a big party to eat and didn't want to not be able to take him. They said sure come on over. Once there we were greeted by the mananger who then introduced us to the cook who then took my son over to show him what he wanted. Wow what amazing and unexpected service. We weren't expecting any special treatment. We had just hoped they could make him a steak without cross contamination of other foods. They went above and beyond and even visited our table multiple times to check on everything. Thank you Rio staff!!!!! We will be back again when in Vegas!!
Oh and the rest of us really enjoyed the buffet! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"This buffet has a lot of varieties.  Food tasted good.  Our multi generation- multi ethnic family enjoyed it!  It is a little off the strip, but not that that far.  It is just behind ti.  Recommend it!"}
{"text":"Staff is great! Lots to choose from and wasn't busy on Friday night. We had a party of 8 and got right in. My kids loved that they had made to order kids friendly foods like burgers and hotdogs. But I enjoy the pho, primed rib, and teppanyaki."}
{"text":"First time at this buffet, it's definitely worth the price! Our party was one of the first at time of opening, all the food was fresh and hot. The variety of food seems endless. They offer many dishes for any customer craving a certain taste. The service was also good .  They have more variety than Bacchanal and it's almost as good (quality is key difference).  I strongly recommend."}
{"text":"If you like overcooked, bland Seafood you'll love this place! Try the calamari they are extra rubbery!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the people who work there are even better. Erika at the front was so helpful with our questions and letting us know as locals what discounts we get. She was so friendly always smiling just turned around our night."}
{"text":"Loved this buffet! We came on the buffet of buffet pass and didn't upgrade to the seafood buffet and it was worth every second. We had it for the dinner buffet and everything we had was amazing. There was a wide range of food and everything was hot and tasted pretty fresh. They even had soup made how you want in front of you and this was the highlight of the meal. I had udon noodles in the most fantastic broth and my girlfriend went for the pho which she fell in love with. They also had a make your own Asian station which was delicious.
I'm not sure what comes with the seafood buffet mark-up but they had sole, crabs legs and shrimp in the non seafood buffet so I was still happy as hell. The only thing that was a bit crap was the desserts but I feel that's the same with ever vegas buffet. They are all frozen package desserts.
Lastly the service was great and a lot more organised than most of the buffets in Vegas and we left our server a nice big tip due to this. Will deffo be coming back here when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Better try Aria or Wynn Buffet before Rio, it's not worth it. The selection is there but not enough quality dishes to choose from. Maybe you could shell out 50+ and try their seafood buffet, but you are only allowed 1 lobster tail. Very disappointed after trying this today, had high hopes from Rio."}
{"text":"Robert the VIP server was great. Made my wife and I feel extra special. We'll definitely be back and we'll bring a few friends next time. The desserts rocked."}
{"text":"When we first moved to vegas, this was one of our favorite buffets. We decided to to revisit it, but we were terribly disappointed at how far they've slipped. There was not a single dish that could even be considered average. The desserts were mostly inedible. Our 8 year that  old couldn't even find a dessert that he liked. On top of all this, they had a really long wait and the price was $93 for 2 adults and a child. If you're staying at rio, use the time you would have spent waiting in line and walk next door to gold coast."}
{"text":"Good selection of food. Surprisingly they had Papaya salad, and it was pretty good. Shout out to Sal who was amazingly friendly and sat us in a matter of time. Nice meeting you Sal, MANY THANKS for taking care of us! Take care! Xoxo"}
{"text":"What a selection! Too bad that all of it tastes almost like nothing. We go here each year, and my boss pays for it! So being free, I rater enjoy it actually. But honestly, if I were paying out of pocket myself, the quality to price ratio is just way way off.

I've had better $14 buffets near home, that while they had less of an overall selection, still offered more seafood, and their smaller selections just have more flavor. This place, as I mentioned before, is really bland."}
{"text":"The most incredibly awful buffet....EVER! We did the seafood upgrade...Stupid! It was horrible, dried out, inedible! My husband literally had 2 bites of food and he was so turned off he pushed the plate away. What a total rip off of $100. I waited 45 minutes just to get the shell breakers and a drink. The waiter just kept walking by us, even when we called for him. Come on Rio....What an absolutely horrible way to treat people!"}
{"text":"This buffet is about half of what it used to be.  Certainly not worth $24.99 for lunch.  Selections have been cut back.  The place was empty when we visited.  Taste was ok, but nothing to warrant the steep price"}
{"text":"$38 per person. Good price. Lots of variety. Seafood included but lobster tails and oysters are part of seafood upgrade for $15 extra. Crab legs inclided are good, on the thin side, but sliced in half for easy eating. Very sweet crab. Mmm... Great dessert bar. Tons of options including gelato and sorbet. Meat selections are great although a little under cooked."}
{"text":"There were a lot of choices to choose from but wasn't all that good. Food was over cooked and most was cold and didn't taste fresh. The desserts didn't even have much flavor. The gelato was good. The whole buffet was overpriced and really not worth it."}
{"text":"Don't come here. Spent $42 brunch buffet for 4th of July weekend. Biggest mistake ever. Crab legs were thinner than my own finger! (Literally) no good BBQ not even prime rib or at least steak only roast beef and ham. Quality of food tasted bland and mediocre aka cafeteria food!! 

I'm sticking with bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace!"}
{"text":"25% off locals, military and police NOT on weekends.  $50+ for seafood buffet IMHO was not worth it.  Both buffets are together but u get a stamp on your hand if you paid extra for the seafood.  Buffet is large and lots of other food to choose from but for a much lesser price u can eat much better quality food at the Wynn or Bellagio.  Won't be back for this buffet for a loooong time."}
{"text":"Oh have times changed! Rio used to have two buffets, but they are now combined to create the Carnival buffet.

PRICING: Locals get discounts, so be sure to show your ID! Regular buffet is around $25-$30 per person. You have the option to upgrade to the seafood buffet on weekends which cost and additional $15.

REGULAR BUFFET: Buffet is broken down into sections like salad, Mexican, Asian, pizza, American, meats, and more. Everything was high quality and delicious.

SEAFOOD BUFFET: The seafood buffet offers everything the regular buffet offers plus a seafood section that you need a stamp to enter. The seafood section offers lobster, crab legs, shrimp, clam chowder, honey walnut shrimp, and so much more!

DRINKS: Drinks are now self-serve, which is becoming a common thing at buffets. You can purchase alcoholic drinks at the bar located conveniently at the buffet. If you're a Rio card member, you can sit in a private dining section that has waiters who will serve you your drinks."}
{"text":"Ok ate dinner before going to the show at the Rio. It had been a few years since I had visited. The old buffet was just seafood. They have now merged the two into a mega buffet. Note the seafood is an added cost. But I was mainly here for the seafood. Also Tip want to save a bunch buy the dining discount card for 5 dollars it will net you a discount here and a bunch of other places. They sell them at the ticket places on the strip. The total cost was 45 with the card.

Ok onto the food. Again if your paying more for seafood then pick your battles up front and head to the right that is where you will find the oceans bounty aplenty. As noted you only get one lobster or several rock lobster tails. I got the tails and they were quite good. I got heaping helpings of both cold and warm legs. These were definitely a very good quality and size. The taste was very good. I don't use any butter so the pure crab meat taste was great with whatever seasoning in the boil pot. Good selection of shrimp cold and fried as well as in garlic butter. All good. Oddly they describe butterflied and fried shrimp as tempura which is an error as the batter is breaded aka southern style. Good selection of sushi, only ate one piece to try, didn't want to fill up. Had a piece of fish it wad ok but got to cooked on the heater, but by no means was it bad. You know going into a buffet if they didn't just put out the item your luck will vary as to how just cooked the item will be. They had scallops in the shell also good. But lucked out fried oysters were just put out fresh. They were awesome, and I was in New Orleans during the oyster festival. Load up on those if you like oysters. They had fresh oysters too, but I didn't want to try them. Also had Rockefeller style. I probably went through five trips to seafood when I realized there was other whole buffet to check out.

At this point I had to be pretty choosey as I was starting to get full. Mainly sampled a small amount of great macaroni and cheese, wish I had more room it was great. One meatball hey didn't want too fill up on the pasta but I can't pass up a good meatball. Was good maybe could use a bit more spice. And had to get some meat from the carving station. It tasted pretty good, but carving stations can be hit or miss again depending on how long said cut has rested. Mine had plenty of rest, but seasoning was good. They had turkey too, but no room. Next I was very impressed by the pan Asian selection. Stuck to the plan and was very selective no noodles or rice, they looked good, but too filling. The beef item was great good spice here. Chicken, bland didn't personally like it. Steamed buns also available as well as customized soup which I had no idea what to do with but it looked impressive. 

Ok now time for dessert. Sampled some chocolate based items and got some coconut gelato. Also had to get the Rice Krispie treat at the small chocolate fountain. They really covered a lot of territory with desserts, but I had already eaten so much that was all I could put away.

On the drinks they have a Pepsi self serve freestyle type machine. It was great. Not sure how Pepsi beat coke at all Cesar's properties, Marriotts as I prefer coke, but this at least let's you add cherry flavoring. You will probably be spending some time with this new friend.

Coffee is also freely available as well. They have alcohol too, but why waste the space with such an array of good food.

I encountered great service, all plates cleared promptly as was the shells. Waitress was nice and pointed me to the bathroom-and brought out wet wipes to clean my hands. 

If you are planning time allocate a minimum of one hour to visit. I arrived at 6 and left around 7:15. Also, know your limits as you don't want to eat too much and feel horrible. 

As for value I see a lot of people complain re price, but when you see lobster at 36.00 or 8 ounces of crab at 24. Shrimp cocktail 14. Lobster bisque soup 12. Dessert 6. Well you should have no problem getting a good value here. That was 92 worth of food but I had more than that. Also strip food gas gotten so much more expensive so the buffet is still a good deal. I paid 36 for lunch at Giadas.

Overall would recommend particularly if you like seafood."}
{"text":"Will not come back because of the low quality food. $59.99 for seafood buffet on holidays but not worth it cause the regular buffet offers crabs n shrimps as well."}
{"text":"Robert was nice! Best waiter ever. He made the Carnival experience much better. Recommend the mimosas don't forget to ask for Robert."}
{"text":"I came out to Las Vegas to have some fun and eat some good food....everyone was talking about the Rio Buffett. Finally got a chance to eat there and it was not what we expected. It was a typical Buffett and the only good dish was the mashed sweet potato. The sprinkles were stale. The clams were not that great. The dessert was cafeteria-ish. My elementary school cafeteria could have been better. Lunch and dinner have the same food for different prices.
No exaggeration."}
{"text":"This buffet was at the bottom of my list after trying 2 other places in Las Vegas. They did have a lot of variety but The quality wasn't  that great. The desserts were good. I did not get the upgraded buffet with the seafood so I am not able to review that portion of the buffet. Overall I would not go back."}
{"text":"What a waste of $$$. Crab was still frozen or extremely cold. Most of the seafood was not thawed. Shrimp was good. Prime rib was Fair. Large variety, just piss poor quality. WAY OVERPRICED! 
Makes you miss Vegas when the mob ran it. Food sucks, service was good. Bartender was exceptional."}
{"text":"An absolute waste of money!  Lobster was mushy if you could even get one. Every serving plate was always empty. Worst buffet experience ever!"}
{"text":"Food was great! They cut the King crab legs in half for you so the work isn't that hard! Before you enter you take a photo and they bring it to you when you're done eating!! They won't bother you during your meal."}
{"text":"I miss the old seafood buffet... my husband and I were really looking forward to the buffet.  We were disappointed from the start which led the rest of the buffet to be disappointing. The old seafood buffet had so many choices it would get overwhelming. But now you feel like you gotta have 1 of everything to make it worth the price even though we did get a discount for showing the players card for locals. Service was great. Kathi took care of us. A better seafood buffet and a bunch of Kathi's would have made it worth it all."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet! Many options to chose from, went there for breakfast & dinner and will go again!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to eat. The food quality is now worse and the selection is horrible. 

The biggest problem are the cashiers and management .  They do not understand customer service and are rude.  

I guess I am not going to return again and simply go elsewhere .  Plenty of other properties in Vegas that treat their customers well."}
{"text":"Went to this buffet last night, let's just say highly overrated. For years ive heard all about how great the lobster and sea food buffets were the best in Vegas and thought when I go I'm gonna have to try. Well last night was the night when I paid my 51.60 to experience the\"best buffet\" in Vegas. The food was mediocre I can't say it was horrible but for the $51 dollar price it should be much better quality. The lobster tails were the baby lobsters (about 3\" in length) and were cut in half, no flavor and some were undercooked. They never had enough crab, by the time I reached the crab after waiting in line there was maybe 6 over boiled single pieces left. I did have other dishes like the shrimp and blackened tuna which was delicious. After eating my \"lobster\" dinner I went for the sweet bar. It's a large selection and I went for a hard chocolate cookie and a blah flan. I'm really not trying to bash this place but it doesn't deserve the $51 price tag for sure. The rivers casino in Rosemont I'll shits on this place and it's only $35, no wanna be \"lobster\" but the quality of food is much better. The service at carnival was excellent but as I said before not worth the bill."}
{"text":"I have a few issues with the Rio buffet, one of which is the fact that they decided to stop serving breakfast (without updating that on the website) and don't open until 4:00 PM - so if you're staying at the Rio, you might start to feel like you're in a food desert. The buffet is kind of pricey, and if we hadn't paid for the Buffet of Buffet passes, we may not have been very happy to pay $60+ for the experience. The hostess was having some sort of tiff with the server, and seated us at the ONLY table that didn't have cutlery, etc., so we were forced to wait until the busy (and super friendly) waitress came and set up the table for us -- and THEN we could start our buffet experience. The chow mein was good, but not high end, expensive entry price good. Everyone working the stations were SO friendly; they really made the experience. The udon noodles were good, but the broth was on the salty side. The pastries were just okay. Nothing to write home about (except maybe the gelato? But we didn't try that). The food (in my opinion) really isn't worth the price. You might as well just shell out the extra dollar and go to the Bacchanal."}
{"text":"My favorite buffet in town!
The food is amazing BUT the only thing that i do not like its that you have to ay extra to get to eat sea food."}
{"text":"this used to be one of the best buffets in vegas. what happened? its terrible now!! poor service and food is WAY below average"}
{"text":"This buffet was a very disappointment for our family and guesses.  For the price we paid, we received very low quality food, it was an embarrassment for us to have our family reunion meal here. The food was not fresh, was salty and just below average, even the fruit was NOT fresh (how can you screw up fruits for God's sake, but, yes they did). I do not recommend to spend your money or precious time here."}
{"text":"Meh. Not worth the money unless you are totally in love with big hunks of meat (a whole 3 to pick from). I did like some of the Chinese food they had. The chicken broccoli was good. The vegetable spring rolls were ok. No egg rolls. No crab ragoon.  (BOOOO...me LOVES crab ragoon)

There was very little to pick from other than the Chinese food and the big hunks of meat that I am totally NOT into. I did try some skewered meat...Yuk!! Nor good flavor at all.

I will say their cheesecake was super delicious but not enough to earn them more than 2 stars. The service was good as well. Never even had to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"The seafood is just fine but I really don't care for this new Buffett due to long line wait INSIDE the buffet once you get in.
Rio combined the world buffet and seafood buffet into one. The result is a downgrade to the seafood buffet in term of ambience and food quality. I don't think that I would consider this place as a must go for seafood in Las Vegas anymore."}
{"text":"I only give it 2 stars because it is so  over priced for me personally. If you are a big eater that is fine but the upwards of 70.00 for a. Pulled people is not that thrilling to me. The food is very average and the people serving you are grouchy to say the least."}
{"text":"We used to enjoy going here 1-2 times per week for our annual Vegas trip. The food, service and just the atmosphere was really good. Not any more! They changed the seafood buffet and it is lacking in quality and service. They no longer bring your beverages and the whole experience was blah. We definitely will not be the returning. Too many excellent choices in Vegas to settle for this!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Good food selection.  Seafood upgrade was worth the $20.  Why is it some people are compelled to eat at a buffet like it's their last meal?  Did I mention overpriced?"}
{"text":"I love seafood and this place will satisfy your seafood cravings just fine! Go with an appetite!"}
{"text":"AVOID!

For those of you that are die-hard seafood and lobster lovers, I would rather pay the premium for Bally's Sterling Brunch for much much higher quality seafood and unlimited quantity of New England Lobsters. For those of you that are ok without lobsters, just stick with bacchanal buffet at Caesars.

As a frequent visitor to Las Vegas and Carnival World & Seafood Buffet(Formerly the Village Seafood Buffet) over the last 15 years. I was SO SO SO shocked and saddened by such a decline in both the Quality and the Quantity of the Seafood selection.

Let me give you a bit of the history I have with this restaurant. The first time I came to Rio Village Seafood buffet was back in 2006(Back when they had two separate restaurants one strictly for seafood and one for regular buffet). I have such a deep affection with this restaurant that I would describe the rise and down of this restaurant in 4 periods I have experienced:

1. The Star of Las Vegas Buffet(2006-2008):At that time, this used to be one of the very best buffets in Las Vegas, if not the best. You get an amazing selection fresh seafood and fresh New England Lobsters. You could see and taste how each food was really prepared with dedication, quality and care with very very high standards.

2. The Stagnant Period(After reconstruction to 2012): price went up a bit after reconstruction while the quality of the Lobster went down a bit(Before reconstruction, the lobster was purely New England Lobsters and was always fresh. After 2012, the lobster was a bit hit and miss, you get a majority of fresh lobsters but you can also get some rotten ones and you also get to see other types of lobsters get mixed in with New England Lobsters. But overall the food selection, the friendliness of the staff and the freshness of the seafood still made this buffet a valuable buffet in Las Vegas.

3. The Decline Period(After changing location and combing to the new Carnival Seafood restaurant-Early 2017): You could clearly see the lobster quality and the quality, selection and freshness of other foods declined by a huge margin, some foods became so rotten that they were almost uneatable. But at least, they offer unlimited lobster, still ok other seafood and meat selection.

4. The Disastrous Period(Will Never Go Back Again, Late 2017 to Present): What? $54.99 for only 5 Lobster Tails? What? Where are the Jumbo Shrimps? Where are all these kinds of selection of good seafood? Where are the Roasted Duck? Where are the fresh fish? Where are the Watermelons? All Gone. I'm now completely wordless with this restaurant."}
{"text":"We got the seafood package. It's not worth $52. My lobster was dry and tasted bad.  I had he rice noodle chicken soup. The broth was SUPER salty.  I would not come back ever."}
{"text":"The WORST \"seafood\" buffet that I have every been to. Not only was it ridiculously expensive, but the food was low quality and subpar. First off, we were lied to in the front in order to add on the extra seafood buffet price. Then everything from the potatoes to the \"seafood\" was disappointing and disgusting. One of the food options was hot dogs on a stick! If your in the mood for low quality expensive food this is the place for you. It was so bad we even had our money refunded. Word of advice save your money and go to any other buffet in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Save your money and go elsewhere!!

This place used to be amazing, but not anymore. We come to Vegas for fashion week twice a year for 25 years and we would always go to the seafood buffet. This is a sad attempt at what was a staple for buffets in Las Vegas. The crab was disgusting and looked like moldy cheese. 

When the manager brought the \"chef\" over he said he tasted it and it was good. We are from the coast of Peru and I've never seen crab like that."}
{"text":"This was an awful experience. My mother and I came from out of town to visit my brother and his family who live locally in Las Vegas full time. The gentleman directing guests told my brother and his wife that if they registered for a players card, they would get 25% off of their meal. So, they walked a half mile to get registered for their players cards and redeem their 25% off tonight. When we got to the counter to purchase our buffet passes, we were waited on by Corina. We were asking her the cost and what it included and she was very rude and annoyed by our questions. She asked how many people and gave us our total and asked for our payment. My brother and his wife provided their players cards. She looked at them and tossed them back. We had her run my debit card. We asked what the discount was and she did not respond. After we paid, she said there is no discount and that they do not offer the players card discount anymore. She said we were told wrong and she will get the manager and to step aside and wait. Corina was rude and condescending the entire time. The manager whose name I think was Price or Bryce?? He was aware of the players club discount and was about to give us the promised amount off. Corina was assisting another customer, but turned around and cut him off saying they do not offer the discount on the weekend. Two minutes ago, she said it didn't even exist??!!! I do not know what her problem was, but it seems like she did not want to allow us to have the promised promotion. Once she said that, the manager said she was right and would not provide the discount. We asked why he would not help us out and he shrugged and said sorry. I asked for a refund and it was credited back to my debit account. We will see if it gets there within two days as promised. Apparently, promotions and promises do not matter at this establishment if the staff doesn't like you for whatever reason?? We will never be back here and do not reccomend eating at this restaurant. Unless you are a masochist who wants to be belittled, humiliated, and treated like poop."}
{"text":"Christmas Dinner At A Buffet??? AMAZING! Kimberly Was Our Waitress and She Kept Our Table Clean and Made Us Laugh. The Food Was Great Too! Being That We're Local, I Think Our Review Counts The Most! Thank You Kimberly!"}
{"text":"We came here at 11:30 for the champagne brunch on Valentine's Day and it took us 15 minutes to get through the line. By 11:45, the line had grown. And by 12:30 there was a line out to the casino. So getting here early is probably a good idea.

They had plenty of options and everything tasted really good. Our waitress was super friendly (maybe too friendly haha), but she kept us loaded up on mimosas the whole morning.

I was fairly unimpressed by the dessert section. They have a gelato case, then some little cakes and tarts. I guess I pictured a wide spread of various dessert options, but it didn't seem like they had a whole lot.

Overall, just fine for the price we paid. We got a discount by going to the Tix4tonight booth ($23 per person)!"}
{"text":"The best buffet I had during my recent trip to Vegas! This place had eggs benedict, champagne / mimosas, succulent short ribs, and all around good food! 

There is also a noodle bar! Which you can try different things like ramen, pho, and udon!

The only thing that was not up to my standards was the sushi. They only had standard rolls, nothing too special. 

Overall great experience. Would definitely go to this one again!

(if you're on the strip - there is a free shuttle that takes you back and forth to the Rio)."}
{"text":"I give this place a 1. The buffet is pretty expensive and I don't think the food is that great. The lady took our drink order and when taking our order, she was rushing us. I ordered a lemonade and I'm not sure why she even had to mention this but was saying the one with full of sugar? Like wtf?! Why would you say that lol....Anyways, the food sucks. Service sucks. The only good part was there was no line. The price is ridiculously expensive for a mediocre buffet. We paid extra $15 for seafood and I thought we were going to eat some legit lobsters but it was tiny ass meat. I rather have gone to Bucchanal buffet at Cesar's instead and spend my money there. I would avoid going here at all costs."}
{"text":"This place is misleading. In front of the restaurant, they advertised a price of $38 for dinner. There are signs everywhere that says, \"two restaurants in one\" or something like that. Once you get to the cashier, you have to pay extra for the seafood. Very misleading. The food was not bad, but it's not as good as people claim it is. In my opinion, Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace is the best buffet on the strip. Don't bother going out of the strip to this overrated buffet."}
{"text":"Wow, they've ruined the best seafood buffet in Vegas.  Food was no where near as good as I was before the change.  Everything was over cooked.  Selection was the pits.  No reason to come to Rio at all now.  Fix this Rio!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had in my life. I looked at all the food and it's old and disgusting. The snow crab legs were salty. The oysters looked like they were shucked a week ago. I tried normal food and everything was disgusting. Our bill was $200 and I don't even think it was worth $20. I feel like I got ripped off. People go somewhere else like the Buchannal Buffet at the Caesars, same price and better food... (Not the best but WAYYYYY better than this)"}
{"text":"This buffet used to be great. Now it's terrible. They raved about the seafood (costs $30 extra), but I didn't see any value in it at all as the regular buffet had shrimp and crab as well. 

Didn't care for any of the food. Very very low grade stuff. There was hardly anyone in the place on a Friday night and I should have known better.

The hotel used to be so much fun too. They had a Mardi Gras float and entertainment, but that's gone now. Only thing left is a smoky casino.  I don't know what happened, but I'll never go back to the Rio again. It's awful.

I recommend you avoid this place and try the Wynn buffet or the Bellagio, or even the Paris one."}
{"text":"We tried the seafood buffet for the first time in many years, and the quality of food has taken a nose dive.  The snocrab was the traditional semi-warm, over cooked meat you expect at a buffet.  The lobster bisque was seasoned well, but had the density of a thick Thanksgiving gravy.  I was temped to pour some on the watered down mashed potatoes.  The fried shrimp was good, as was the prime rib.  The waiter was void of personality and service, and seemed bothered when we asked for a missing set of silverware.  Overall, not worth the $50 we spent per person.  Go to Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack for a better meal and competent service."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to the Carnival World Buffet...for a while it was my favorite.  However on my last visit it definitely wasn't anything special.  Service was good though, as my server kept my drink filled and removed the empty plates while I was gone.  The Carnival World Buffet and the Rio Seafood Buffet now share the same space (temporarily?) and for an additional $15 you may be granted passage to the 1 extra buffet station reserved exclusively for the seafood buffet.  Sine there was plenty of seafood on the regular buffet i skipped this option.  The crab legs were served in bunches of 4 which was nice but they were smaller than i would've expected here.  Gone were the fried scallops and clams which used to be on the CWB.  In fact a whole section was empty of any food save for dinner rolls thrown in the serving tray.  There were several dessert options...the bananas foster was the best.  Gone were the mini fruit tarts that used to be a favorite of mine.  Sorry Rio, but as a Total Rewards member I think I'll spend my comps elsewhere."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst buffets I have ever eaten at.  Maybe because it was lunch time but the price of $34.99 per person for such a meagre selection and poor quality of food was astounding to me.  I was expecting for that price the same quality as somewhere like Ceasar's or Bellagio.  There was hardly any seafood, a few measly tiny shrimp and the smallest crab I have seen at a buffet.  The only saving grace was the dessert station wasn't bad.  The quality of the savory food was appalling, tasted and looked like it has been sat there for 2 weeks.

I am not having a go at RIO as some of their other restaurants the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"Like some others have stated, the buffet has gone downhill. Dry, tasteless food. Not that much of a selection. Only food was was decent was the fried shrimp. The fish was dry and had a weird odor. Needless to say, I spit it out and didn't eat it. It's not worth spending $30 for the buffet. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: got tickets to seafood buffet by attending timeshare. Did not pay anything.

The buffet is impressive in size. Variety of items, but quality is lacking. Every second Lobster tail was spoiled. Crab legs were stale. There really is not much difference between seafood side and regular buffet - oysters, rotten Lobster tails, mussels. 

Prime rib was unappetizing to me. Duck was edible. Ice creams (gelatos) underwhelming. Certainly not worth paying $50 price tag for this.

We went midday at dinner. Buffet had plenty of room empty all night. It looks pretty in pictures and variety is impressive, by quality is either unacceptable or just so-so."}
{"text":"This place was such a great find! I remember when the Carnival World Buffet and the Seafood Buffet were two separate buffets at opposite ends of the hotel. They were both good then and they are still good today. During my most recent visit I mainly focused on the seafood portion of the buffet. I devoured the snow crab legs and mini lobster tails. I definitely got my money's worth on just those two items! If you're in town and really hungry for some seafood with a side of salad and such, the  Carnival World Buffet just may be for you."}
{"text":"I write this review with sadness in my heart. This was the very first buffet I've been to in Vegas when I visited my friend in 2011. I was blown away by the quality and selection. I've moved to Vegas in 2013 and been going every once in a while. The quality declined so much while the price was hiked. Too bad.... Was a favorite of mine. 

Bottom line: not only it's not worth $32,  it's not even worth $20."}
{"text":"This buffet use to be great. We gave them 2 stars for the food. The lobsters were soaked in an oily fluid and mealy. The chicken was good Chinese food was fair. The service and staff in general were outstanding. They get 5 stars from us. Would we ever go back? No."}
{"text":"I always go to the Rio for their Buffet (Carnival) when my friend comes to visit me,  because it's so amazing!! I have even recommended it to other people. This time however, I was very very disappointed and I will never go back. My girlfriend and I love the crab legs so that's what we really look forward to when we go. Not only did they jack up their prices but they took away the crab legs and replaced it with blue crab! FIRST off blue crab does not compare to the crab legs that we used to get! Not only that but they have California rolls there that have the fish eggs on them and \"it's made that way now\" is what I was told. I personally don't like fish eggs on my California rolls. So bottom line, jacked up prices, no more crab legs replaced with crappy blue crab and California rolls that were not even good!!! We would like to try the seafood buffet but we were so disgusted with the Rio that we don't even want to go back.

After this review, the owner messaged me directly to try and make up for my disappointing experience. I appreciate that..so I'm revising my original review. Thank you for that, it means a lot!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently you have to give this establishment one star!!! That is already over praise. I am active duty military from Honolulu,HI and I know a thing or two about \"Fresh\" seafood and this buffet is far from fresh!!! I visited this place on my vacation/birthday and was poisoned by this so called \"fresh\" seafood. Heed my warning people do not eat here!!! I have never experienced food poisoning until I ate at this restaurant. Never again. Oh and when I brought it to the managements attention they did an \"investigation\" were it was \"inconclusive\" (how convenient) that this restaurant was the factor of my food  illness. (The only place I ate that day). Please please don't support this place!!!"}
{"text":"Seafood buffet review:
We wanted plenty of options plus crab legs. We thought we needed to pay for the seafood buffet to get crab apparently,  the regular buffet offers some seafood options. There was no need for the upgrade unless you want strictly gourmet seafood which we rate that a 2/5 stars the frozen crab legs, frozen crab claws, frozen shrimp and two inch lobster tails were flavorless. 

Service:
We complained to Courtney management and they refunded us the difference between the regular buffet to seafood buffet with no hassle. Management 5/5 stars. Customer service we rate 5/5 stars. Angel was an awesome waiter recovered our table in a quickly manner and made sure the dishes didn't pile up on in our faces. He was very friendly and attentive.

Carnival buffet review:
Many food options to choose from great variety. Quality is good. Desserts are limited but great cheesecake and bread pudding."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here today and we thought it was great.  They had both blue and snow crab.  Yes, some stuff is hit or miss buts it a moderately priced buffet.  They had tofu options and the desert bar was amazing.  If you want to love everything go to the Wicked Spoon."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here 6 years ago (2011) and it was THE BEST buffett in Vegas!
We ate there again on 7/18/17 and it was WAY below \"Vegas Buffett Standard\". Even though they had separate sections (Italian food, Asian food, American Standard, etc) - there was hardly any selection in each section. The food wasn't that tasty (like it was 6 years ago), and the food handling was a bit odd. Fresh fruit sitting right next to heat-lamp selections (giving you very warm fresh fruit), other food items not under food lamps or on steam tables (cool fettucini). We tried items from every section of the buffet. Underwhelmed. Lack of flavor, dried out. Even the pizza wasn't good (too much salt in the sauce). Probably won't be eating here again. Not worth $30 per person."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst buffet in Las Vegas. If I could leave minus stars I would. Here on a FOOD convention and brought my guests here since it was voted \"Best Buffet in Vegas\". Far from it. The food was cold, unappetizing, chips stale and overall poor selections. Even after complaints to the night manager, we found no relief or justification. The samples from the convention where even better then their best offerings. Avoid at all costs. Try \"Cravings\" at The Mirage, it was far better."}
{"text":"My family and I wanted to try it again after many years of not coming here. It was so disappointing because the food was not very good and their old food are no longer there. The meat was really dry and hard to chew and the dessert was just terrible. I have always been very fond of their dessert but today was just not my day. I don't think I'll be coming here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a few weeks ago. It was about 15 of us. They got a seating area for us very quickly. It was in a corner so it was kind of private which was nice. 

We all paid the extra to get the exclusive seafood side of the buffet. They have so much to choose from, it's almost overwhelming. Lol. But I found myself on the seafood side the most. Which they stamp your hand & they check your hand with a light before letting you in that section of the buffet. Everything looked so good & every item I got was fresh & full of flavor. They had so many desserts to pick from. There was something for everyone in our group. Our waitress was very good at making sure to pick up plates & over refills when needed. We all thought it was reasonably priced for everything we got. 

It was a good time. We all got our fill. Great service & food. We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Paid extra for the seafood only to end up with a stomach ache from the oysters. Way overpriced."}
{"text":"This buffet was good back in the day. It has gone downhill and is now by far one of the worst buffets ever. The food is cold, stuck to the serving plates and tastes like frozen food quality. What a shame. Don't eat here! It is unacceptable!!! Be not fooled by the Seafood Buffet. It is a 25.00 up charge and not worth it. Go to Caesar's Bachannal Buffet. You won't be disappointed there."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here was in the early 90's. The food was great back then and today it's still tasty. I loved the Chinese station with the roast duck and crispy pork. Also, the assorted dumplings were great. I thought the seafood upgrade was not worth the price. If they added  king crab, then it would be. On the desert side, the gelato was great! I would eat here again minus the seafood add on."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money, find a good buffet, this one apparently is no longer tasty. I wish I would have listened to the countless horrible reviews and not gone by the way the seafood looked the last time I was there. This was my second time back and it was horrible, the first time the beef on the carving station and the sushi were not bad, but noting else had any flavor. I didn't get the seafood part of the buffet last time and visually it looked wonderful from a far, however, it was far from wonderful! 
I could have eaten a lot more than I did but was so turned off by the mostly old and spoiled seafood that I almost threw up at the table. The lobster was a joke, you have to either pick one whole lobster that weighs about 1 lb or 5 half tails that are not even the size of any lobster tail, they are in fact the smallest lobster tails I've ever seen not to mention they were way past their prime. The oyster were old and tasted spoiled and so did everything else."}
{"text":"This is a decent buffet. I remember 20 years ago when it was number one. I don't really think the quality had gone down, but the competition came along and raised the bar significantly. Still a great buffet, just not the best. The food is quality and the the place is kept very clean."}
{"text":"Sub par. Everything I ate tasted pretty dry, and tasted like it was just microwaved. Big selection, but I say spend your money elsewhere. Better off going to hometown buffet."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, in a Vegas far far away ... this venue held the title of Best Buffet in Vegas. 

Now it is dark for breakfast & lunch on weekdays, apparently unable to draw enough customers to merit opening until 4pm. 

Oh, by the way, The Rio just went public on Friday admitting an outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease. I walked the property, for the first time in many years, on Thursday. Happy, happy, joy, joy.

The legacy of former-CEO Gary Loveman lives on.

UPDATE: Wandered by this space again on a Saturday, round 4pm. Totally empty. Oh, and I noted the price. $35. Want seafood? It's a $20 up-charge. No wonder it's not busy. There are many better Vegas buffets for less; shop around."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the Rio buffet in several years. I went again today because of fond memories of how delicious the food was. I paid the excessively high entry gladly for the food I remember, and I have never been so disppointed with a restaurant in my life. Either no seasoning or over seasoned, all overcooked and dry, and some major cross contamination. It's as if no one on the staff cares anymore. My prime rib was a dried out brick, the rice was dried out, the bbq sauce on the ribs tasted like salt, the gravy tasted like salt, the vegetable roll sushi had an old fishy flavor, the bread pudding was old and had begun to gelatinize, and even the ice cream had freezer burn. NOT ONE REDEEMING DISH! I'm not so much angry as I am disappointed. I've made day trips to Vegas and back from San Diego, just to eat at the Rio. By the looks of it, this buffet is dead. What a shame."}
{"text":"Meat at every station was bland and chewy. Everything had a plastic taste to it. Desserts were not good at all. Most condiments tasted watered down to make it last. 

Food was actually insultingly bad for how much I had to pay. I have had food 1000x better at Sizzler.

The order of the food made no sense. Seafood then breakfast then tacos then breakfast again then pasta. 2 separate stations for noodles and fried rice and neither were good. Seriously misguided buffet."}
{"text":"Muito bom para quem gosta das típicas comidas americanas, bem gordurosas, cheias de pimenta e empanadas, sempre. Mas muito gostoso!! E come-se à vontade por apenas 25 dólares por pessoa no almoço, incluindo o buffet de sobremesas."}
{"text":"DON'T GET THE SEAFOOD UPGRADE!! The carnival part would get a 4 for buffets. It's the seafood part that drags it down. I used to come here twice a year from Colorado and eat at the seafood buffet when it was located on the east side where the Kiss shop and mini golf is. It was wonderful. Everything cooked well, fresh, plentiful. Now it is a small section. The hot crab was way over cooked, the lobster tasted like it was from yesterday, the calamari was rubber and really hard to chew, and the cocktail shrimp was a little soft and mushy. The carnival buffet had clam chowder, fried fish, fried shrimp, and cold crab cut in half. That's all you need. I'm a huge seafood fan and was very upset that my friend paid the extra $15 for the seafood. Save the extra $15 for the craps table, not the crab table (see what I did there. It was a pun. Nailed it)."}
{"text":"I love it here.. Robert took very good care of us he was amazing!!  They have a wide variety of food.  You can't go wrong coming here... money well spent"}
{"text":"Pretty over the top buffet with some good food.  There is a long wait to get in.  I don't eat a lot at once, so I'm not sure I got my money's worth...but that's just me.

Things could be labelled better...other than that, it's about what I think you'd expect from a buffet."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a few years to come back to this buffet. When I ate here there was one price  $50 for the whole buffet and the food was delicious. Now you guys have 1 price for regular and an additional  $20 if you want seafood and these reviews aren't very good. I had planned on bringing some friends here who would be visiting Vegas for the first time. Now I'm not so sure. Bummer!"}
{"text":"This buffet definitely has the variety of food from different cuisines, however the quality and taste of the food are compromised. My favourite item would be the roasted beef sirloin! Without any complimentary sauce it's still moist and succulent. It's $32.99 per person but the seafood section requires an additional $20, which I give a thumbs down. Without the seafood, everything else is just mediocre and doesn't deserve that price. Overall, I wouldn't return; nevertheless it wouldn't hurt trying it once."}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price! Love the champagne or mimosa with the seafood purchase"}
{"text":"Sadly,  this buffet has gone downhill, fast. We had a great coupon,  and even half price, it was not worth it. It used to be our favorite,  but even the desserts have changed, the gelato is still great, but not much else. Very basic,  nothing was delicious,  out of 4 plates, only one was worth eating. Dry, tasteless. My hubby  loves shrimp, after peeling 7, and then taking one bite, he said they were tasteless. Even the pizza tasted bad, greasy, couldn't finish it. I hope it improves."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for 6 years and have always had a good experience. The food selections are good and the quality is always excellent. No complaints there. We always ask for our favorite server, Ofelia, who is just the sweetest and most wonderful person you'll ever meet. 

This past visit (7/1/17) was somewhat disappointing. We asked for Ofelia and was informed she was no longer a server. She was a \"busser\". How do you take the best server in the world and make her bus (sp?) tables? We later found out they did away with ALL servers and now all they had was \"attendants\" and \"bussers\". Tragic."}
{"text":"We went here on Christmas day after seeing the 4 hour wait for the Caesars buffet.  I knew about this buffet because i've eaten there years ago.  The wait was much more reasonable at a half hour and the price was about 30-40% less than the strip.  The food selection was outrageous and the food quality was above average for a buffet.  If you have that urge to go to a Vegas buffet but don't want to mortgage your house to do so, this is a good bet."}
{"text":"Went to this buffet paid $20 for premium seafood, and $15 for unlimited wine. Overall experience was quite disappointing, and I had diarrhea for past couple hours. 

Wine: they are serving boxed wine if you purchase the unlimited wine. The Chardonnay was ok, not a fan of the house cab. 

Food: When I go to premium buffet, two things I like is shellfish and steak. I paid $20 and got a ticket for lobster, I got the entire steamer lobster, it's about 0.75 lb. The lobster had freezer  burn, I had it swap out for half lobster tail, much better. The prime rib selection was either well done or medium. Medium was more like medium well done. Other food selection was very limited, chinese food was dried up, they only had few kinds of sushi, cheese options. The dessert is the best part of this dinner, flan and creme brûlée was one of the best I had. 

Service: it's regular buffet service. I don't have high expectation here. 

My neighborhood buffet costs $13 on the weekend serves better food and has more selection than this, minus the lobster and they have limited crab legs. The the worst part of this place is food safety. At this price, they should really train their employees to handle the food properly. I don't remember having food poisoning for past year. I will not recommend this place, if you really want buffet, and do not want to go to other better rated buffet on the strip, skip the seafood add on, it's totally not worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to Carnival World Buffet before the merge and while the selection is large, isn't really worth the price on it's own- splurge for the Seafood Buffet: Mon-Fri it's $48/pp, which is steep, but locals get 25% off with ID. 

Regular buffet selection is huge and does include seafood items, larger selection than most other buffets but average quality (avoid the dim sum and choose your desserts carefully) - the upcharge gets you to a sectioned-off area you can only access after  showing your blacklight-activated lobster stamp.  That's where you want to go to get your money's worth.

Cooked fish dishes, large fried shrimp tempura, cajun crawfish, shrimp & grits, and other  similar choices  greet you before you get to the chowders, bisques (not the same as  the one upstairs at VooDoo), and raw bar-  featuring  oysters,  several types of crab claws, and gigantic, peeled cocktail shrimp. The poke was pretty lackluster but the sashimi  section made up for it- snag the salmon, it goes quick.

If I were to come back, I'd stick to the raw items and the meats and desserts from the  regular area. Despite the bigger price tag, service was less attentive than other off-Strip buffets and dishes weren't cleared and refills oddly weren't offered."}
{"text":"Read review on lots of different Vegas buffets and saw that all of them had bad reviews mixed with good.  Was almost swayed away from here because of a few reviews, but glad I followed my gut (pun intended).  

Went for dinner at about 8:00. Crab legs were my draw, and I wasn't disappointed at all. They had 3 types (cold, split cold, and warm).  All were good. Not a ton of meat in each, but you can eat as many of those suckers as you want, so I was VERY pleased.  Pizza was good, surprisingly.  I also had the sushi, and that was good. The buffet is very spread out and you can get full before you even get to the other end.

Now here are some tips that I wish I would have read before I went that I will share with you:

1) Buy your \"tickets\" at one of those 1/2 price ticket places along the strip.  It costs $2 per person for each voucher which will discount your meal drastically. We paid ONLY $49ish for TWO of us for dinner. That's less than $25 per person, or 1 bet on blackjack.  GREAT deal!

2) If you are staying anywhere near Harrah's, you can take the free shuttle to Rio. It boards every half hour from the valet section (back of building) of Harrah's. It picks you up and returns you too.

3) They have 2 buffets on 1 place. One is seafood and one is not.  The seafood one costs more.  If you just want crab legs DO NOT pay for the seafood upgrade because the non-seafood side had crab legs too!  Nice bonus. The non-seafood side also had sushi, trout, crawfish, and such. Not sure how much more the other side had.

Finally, I want to give a shoutout to Orlando. He was awesome.  The drinks (soft drinks were included) kept coming, and he was clearing plates swiftly and with a smile.

Thanks, Orlando, and Rio for a great surprise!"}
{"text":"The seafood, is completely cut off from the rest of the buffet. At $35, this food is not even worth that price , you will find hamburger stew , Fried chicken and various soups. This buffet in its current state reminds me of food from a mall food court. If you want seafood it's another $20-$30 and you can get some very small crab legs and tiny pieces of lobster. Don't go here ,The food court at the fashion show mall actually has better food, go there if you want choices."}
{"text":"WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY !!!!! I had this buffet a few years ago and it was good ... not great .... but good. I went for the seafood and the crab legs in particular. By the time you get back to your table the crab legs are cold. They need to figure out another way of keeping them hot. The cold shrimp were like rubber and i was afraid to eat any of the shell fish after tasting the shrimp. 
Tried the prime rib and it was tough, like It had been left over from the lunch buffet.  Last time i am doing a buffet in vegas. 
I tried all the top rated buffets and now feel i am better off going to a regular restaurant. For the money it would have been a better deal."}
{"text":"Im giving this once really good buffet 1 star because of the the desert. I am not reviewing the seafood buffet section, only the carnival buffet section. $32.99 weekday price, not worth more than $15.00. I dont know what else to say besides this....food selection bad. Food quality, bad. There is literally nothing worth your admission. The shrimp is nearly raw and NOT peeled. The crab legs are \"cluster\" which basically means you get a lot of tiny legs attached to little cut in half bodies. I am sorry but this used to be a really good buffet and now i swear i will never eat here again. Pay more go to Bellagio or caesars"}
{"text":"Overall food was not as good as it used to be the seafood section was good we have to pay extra 20 bucks a person to get it. the atmosphere definitely has gotten worse probably because of the all you can drink alcohol beverages and that cost extra too"}
{"text":"I wish i could give it 0 stars. The buffet is a joke. Mediocre food. The mexican selection is worse than taco bell. Chinese food is ok, a bit better than panda express. The regular seafood selection is questionable. And then here comes Dessert....they can't even get the chocolate mousse right. Mineral water was great tasting though"}
{"text":"Go early! We went for dinner, arrived at 8 pm and got seated by 10 pm. the line was super long. recommend  you upgrade or pay the extra $20 for the seafood  buffet if you  want the king crab legs. the prime rib was delicious."}
{"text":"We had the seafood buffet as oppose to the regular buffet. I'm really glad we got this as freebies. It's really regular food and nothing really shines. The lobster we got was extremely dry. Trust me, the seafood upgrade is really not worth it. And there is plenty of shrimp and other seafood in the regular buffet. I gave it a three because it really does have a huge selection of food. I would be really be surprise if you couldn't find something you like. The dessert selection is everything you'd want in a desserts. If I had no self-control and wanted to be sick or diabetic, I could spend the whole time eating from all the treats they had out."}
{"text":"Food quality has gone down. Unbelievable as we use to love this place and is one of the reasons we would come to Vegas! Now we have to find a new spot to love. 

Disappointed.... :-("}
{"text":"We ate here at about 430-5pm on a Saturday we didn't have to wait long in line or to be seated. There were 5 of us, 3 got seafood buffet, 2 regular. Everyone liked their food. The mashed sweet potatoes were AMAZING!!! The craved meats were good and also the bread pudding. Our waiter was attentive refilling our drinks and clearing plates. This buffet almost got 4 stars from me so I hope they read this review and make some changes! 2 people in our party that had the seafood buffet had the runs about 10 mins after they finished eating. They each had to run to the restroom about 3-4 times in the hour after we ate before we left the casino! Rio don't charge so much and skimp on food quality and safety. Always make sure the food is fresh and handled properly. Even though I was in LOVE with the mashed sweet potatoes we will not be returning to this buffet."}
{"text":"This buffet used to be one of my favorites in Vegas, but the quality has declined so much & I don't think you get what you pay for. The eggs are watery, bacon is half-cooked, and even things like the crab legs do not seem of the same quality as before. Avoid Rio's buffet if you care about your health. Hopefully, they can turn it around and restore the quality like back in the early 2000's."}
{"text":"My friends and I was visiting Las Vegas last month and we stayed at the Rio so we decided to tried the buffet since the line was very long.  It took about 10 minutes to get in and the price was not cheap.  It advertised itself as a Seafood Buffett with lobsters.  The tiny half sized lobster tail was way over cooked and it was SOOO SMALL.  The shrimp was also over cooked.

They have many food selections but the quality of the food (most of them) was not good.  Not for the price that they are charging."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about. Food was below average. If you like seafood then maybe it's a good value. Considering I'm allergic, I stuck to the main food. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Its not terrible but I wouldnt go back, especially when there are many other buffets for just slightly more $ that beat it hands down.  The seafood was not good quality, and lot of the stuff on the non-seafood side looked gross (almost everything from the italian, asian and mexican stations) .  Worst crab legs ive ever had they were soft, salty and fishy.  That was a shame because I look forward to crab legs most.  The lobster tails and shrimp  were mediocre and raw oysters were bad.  The carved meats were ok.  The salads, ribs, chicken wings, pizza and desserts were pretty good."}
{"text":"We bought the $20 for extra seafood.  It gets you a lobster and a selection of shellfish which is not available on the regular buffet. (can get crab on reg buffett)
Arrived around 5 and the line filled up very quickly. 
Two people $115
Nice desert selection and regular buffett options all appeared to be same quality you find at any standard buffett."}
{"text":"Was one of the best buffets back in the day. Used to be incredible. Now its a former shadow of what it used to be - they obviously cut back budgets and it really really shows. They need to update the decor and rethink the entire menu. I feel sorry for people who go here based on past old 5 star reviews. Avoid unless you are in the casino already and really hungry."}
{"text":"Very expensive, but they provide a wide selection of food varieties. You have to pay extra for the seafood side which is not worth it! The cashier made a comment about lobster tails, which was untrue.very disappointed!! 

They have Japanese, Mexican, bbq, etc. that was nice, but they didn't have a wide selection within the varieties. The salad bar was virtually non existent. They don't even have sunflower seeds!! 

The food itself isn't that great. The crab legs were the worst crab legs I have ever had, the prime rib was for sure not prime. 

The dessert selection was nice and tasty though. Find a different spot, not worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"This place has great food but there cashier's suk and are slow and only have 1 person at the register when they have over 100 people in line"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of seafood. Clams, mussels, lobster, octopus, you name it. We went because we had a comp. Two people will be a 100$ so it's pricey. The buffet is probably a quarter mile long so they have something for everyone. I recommend it"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service loved everything they had that I got. Crab was on point and ice cream, Good coffee and great atmosphere. Will definitely recommend to everyone if your in the mood for a sea food buffet."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday, hoping for the seafood buffet at lunch. Unfortunately, it is only served at dinner on week nights. Should've checked - our bad. To make it worse, we went ahead with just the regular buffet. What a mistake! The food was not fresh, poor quality, and most items had obviously been through a flavor extractor. We'd eaten lunch at the Paris buffet the day before and considering they are the same price, we expected so much more from this one (Paris has snow crab all the time, no crab at this one) . One star for the great service, - stars for the food."}
{"text":"This seafood buffet was amazing 10 years ago. Now they have you pay $25 extra to get the seafood part of this buffet. We pay the extra and then see that the regular buffet has all but one or two of the Seafood options that you pay extra for. On top of this there are no really good options, just mediocre. There are a lot of mediocre options on the strip for a lot less money."}
{"text":"The rio world buffet .
The good: huge selection there's Asian, Mexican, Indian, and European stations . the crab legs here don't seem as good as buccanal buffet in Caesars palace. The food is ok at best . They have pho, ramen, and udon . A drink station . 

Don't go for the sea food and pay the extra 20$ for it . The seafood rio is in the same buffet but closed off . There isn't much more of a selection for 20$ . The deserts have no flavor and the food seems like it's been left out for a long time under a heat lamp . This place used to be crowded but not anymore, that's probably why the food isn't that fresh . The prime rib is always a hit or miss but it was a miss this time at rio . The best part of the deserts is the ice cream gelato . The flan had no flavor or creaminess, just plain flan . The drinks here's resell serve now , it kinda makes it feel like a cheap buffet that cost 35$ . 
Would come back only if I did the 24hour buffet pass"}
{"text":"the worst buffet I have been to, I m from LA, I paid $120 for 2 seafood buffet in here. I felt like It is such a ripped off. Seafood is bad. I can have this kind of buffet in around $20/person in LA. seriously."}
{"text":"My ticket to see Penn and Teller included a reduced price for this buffet so I figured when in Rome? Or so I naively thought...as this was the most disgusting buffet I've ever experienced. Despite advertising having some 300 dishes to try from, the majority were absolutely inedible and some of the stuff I tried literally made me gag. Looking around many people seemed to be having the same experience - so much food got thrown away :( The staff were actually very sweet and helpful but the quality of food was appalling and it was only a fraction cheaper than the Wynn's buffet (the best one I've ever had!) so was shocked and disappointed in just how grim and quite frankly gross the offerings were. Don't go, you will regret your decision."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of buffets and there are many to choose from. For me it comes down to the experience and the people. They have a guy at the Carnival by the name of John Roberson, that is great at both being a people person, and giving you that exceptional experience. 
When I want a Seafood Buffet, I go to the Rio to see John"}
{"text":"So not worth the price. The seafood is mediocre at best. Crab legs are rubbery and hard to open.  The lobster was mushy. The fish overcooked. We used to love going to the Seafood Buffet at the Rio. We would save our money so we could go and it was always a yummy treat. Now, it is overpriced and underwhelming. Save your $48 and go to a nice restaurant instead. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends for the first time and initially it was rather confusing. Overall I had an expectation before paying for the seafood buffet to be added to my bill but what the heck, I went for it. The restaurant is located inside the Rio hotel with a free parking garage near the entrance but the confusion was the marque outside the restaurant with the price advertisements. The weekend and weekday prices are different and the prices are different on those days for both buffets. That sentence even read confusing. Bottom line, there are two different buffets one with basic variety of food and desserts and the second one for all seafood items. Both are served daily but are different prices on weekend and weekdays. The food was \"okay.\"  Honestly,  the extra $10 bucks or so for the seafood buffet is worth it for seafood lovers who enjoy all types of seafood. If you want a variety of boiled crabs this is not worth it. I ate my money's worth on \"lobster medley\" the sauce is not seasoned well and I have no idea what it is but dipped in garlic butter made it better. There are crab legs and chilled crab legs also almost any type of seafood you'd want even some exotic choices. The grilled salmon was the best seasoned selection i tasted. I did not eat much from main side but my friends liked the prime rib and other steak selections. The bread pudding was really good. Our server was AWESOME, (5 stars for him) friendly and attentive. It's worth a try but I would recommend serious consideration before paying extra for the seafood side (hand stamped and viewed with blue light for entry)."}
{"text":"The food was cold, and bland. We were very disappointed. The seafood section had small crab legs and strange fish dishes. The non seafood section had the same crab legs and breaded shrimp!! Wth is the point of paying more for the seafood? The management and customer service was amazing! We voiced our concern and they refunded our whole meal and the sever was very professional and nice."}
{"text":"I used to be frequent customer of this seafood buffet. Now i doubt ill come back. Dont be fool by there ayce lobster buffet because its not a ayce eat lobster buffet. You pay 50 plus dallor for the seafood buffet but have the choice of 5 lobster tails or 1 whole lobster. They should tell you that before paying not once your inside and paid already."}
{"text":"We chose the seafood buffet, which was over priced, seafood was mediocre, most of the crab was cold and over cooked. Staff was rude, pushy, and slow."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the quality of food here for the price. I found a lot of it bland and dry, though there were a couple of things (the Hawaiian pork and mashed potatoes) that were decent. I came in for dinner, and it cost $35 for a meal I don't think I would have paid $10 for anywhere else. They did have a lot of selections, and in terms of size, this was one of the bigger buffets I've visited. Unfortunately, the quality just doesn't measure up. I was especially unimpressed with the creme brulee for dessert, which was overcooked and incredibly bland."}
{"text":"I have been here for many time.they keep changing the price and hours, but the food taste and quality does not go up. It cost us $172 for 4 adult after local discount. 

They do not serve crab on the regular dinner any more, unless you choose the seafood upgrade which will cost $20 more.  The reason why I keep going there is because of prime rib, crab and dessert. Those are the only things I liked there. But now it cost me 50 dollar something for one dinner which is too expensive for me. Won't go there any more."}
{"text":"Had the seafood buffet on Saturday. Mediocre at best. Had to wait 10 minutes for a server to come over so I could request a crab claw cracker, seafood was definitely not inspired, mushy crab, no real reason to spend that much ($100 for two) on that level of food."}
{"text":"Way, way over priced. If you are expecting seafood be prepared for $20 up charge. Good mediocre. Desserts pretty good.  Baked salmon dry, very little unbreaded items. Crab legs on regular buffet tiny.  Lots of Asian dishes."}
{"text":"This place was decent 3 and a half years ago and would have gotten 4 stars. Maybe even 5. The price went up from 41.99 to 49.99 for the seafood which was terrible. The lobster tails were awful along with their oysters and king crab which were burried in ice diluting the flavor. You are better off skipping the seafood and doing the regular buffet. The Gelato was horrible compared the last time I was there. You could taste the ice in the Gelato.

Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This place is worth every penny so make sure you come with an appetite. Also don't forget to upgrade to get your hands on the seafood buffet as well! Pricy but worth it! It was confusing walking through the hotel to find the place but there are signs that help you...we haven't eaten at any buffets since we landed in Vegas and this was our first & last buffet during our weeks stay. 

The seafood buffet was just amazing! I've never seen such a wide selection of seafood and there was just so many things to choose from! Not too sure if there was even a time limit for eating there but it seemed like we were there forever just trying out things to eat. They even have a pho station and desserts!? Like omg it was so overwhelming but everything was great! 

We're from Oahu and we still talk about how great that place was, 6 months later. We'll be back next year ;-)!"}
{"text":"Food is decent and good selection but we waited over 40 minutes to get in. Very long line and one person was working register."}
{"text":"I have been going there since they opened.  When I lived in Vegas, I was hitting the Seafood buffer once a week.  Last December I went and discovered it had moved and things had changed.  My last visit being on Sunday September 10th, will be my last visit.  The price is now an outrageous $55 per person, and you get your choice of one 4 ounce tail, or five tails the size of my thumb!  Service is horrible, the staff is very rude, and now as an extra bonus you have to get your own drinks!  couldn't find the water, and they would not get me any, the quality of the food has dropped so low that I feel that they rob each and every person that eats there.  Never ever ever again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Rio for years. The buffet in the early 90's was a slam dunk good deal. It had gone downhill in the last 10 years. But I'm happy to see they reinvented itself and came back up to a good buffet. You really can't beat it for the selection and the price."}
{"text":"The food was average at best. No crab legs at the weekend brunch. Really went downhill. They do not even wait on you any more. You have to get up and go and get your own drinks. 40 bucks a person and they cannot even bring you an ice tea. When I am on vacation I want to be served and relax. Nope you have to go and get your own beverages now. I want be back to this buffet. Try the Ceasar's Palace buffet. World class food and service."}
{"text":"Decor 4 stars
Service 4.5 stars
Food 4.2 stars

Vegas has so many buffets and sometimes it is confusing to choose which one is good for you.

Compare to other buffet that most has salty food ( don't confuse seasoned food to salty food), 

Carnival 's food seasoned good , WITHOUT salty taste that makes your hypertension goes skyrocket.
I really enjoyed the food, with many selections to choose from.

For vegetarians and gluten free eaters, quite few selections that really appetizing.
For meat lover, you will see so many options as well.
For seafood lover, you are lucky!!
By adding $20 on dinner, you can enjoy lobster, crab legs and oysters. 
( little bird told me, the seafood offer might be taken out starting May 12)
Better hurry up to enjoy them while it last.

For beer and wine drinker, you can add $13 on buffet and you will get unlimited draft beer or house wine.

As for me, the highlight of my dinner was desserts.
Kudos to pastry chefs for the creative presentation, taste quality are superb."}
{"text":"I think I gained 10 pounds at this buffet! There are so many options of food: American, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Italian, Vietnamese, Mexican etc. the seafood section is an extra $15 I think, but the regular buffet also includes some seafood like crab legs, shrimp cocktail & sushi. 

I thought all the food was tasty and pretty good quality for a buffet; there was nothing that I thought was subpar.. And I almost tried a bite of everything lol. 

My favorite parts of this buffet was the make your own pho/ramen station and the gelato station. 

Overall, this is one of my favorite buffets I've been to. If you're staying at Harrahs or the Rio, you get a coupon book which has $10 off which makes the buffet a pretty good deal! I will definitely come back to this buffet when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"The buffet was decorated more modern than what I remember from years ago. It also seemed like the square footage was smaller. However, the food was top notch quality at every station. The teppanyaki was delicious. Also, we didn't pay for the seafood upgrade but there was plenty of seafood at the regular buffet! They even have a private bathroom for the buffet guest. A great experience!"}
{"text":"Prices are very high for the food quality.  I chose the seafood buffet for $50/person and most all of the items were over cooked."}
{"text":"First off, told the hostess I was allergic to seafood and asked to be seated far from the seafood areas. She seats us at a dirty sticky table. I see the same hostess and state this table is filthy get someone to clean it, I take Benadryl as I was starting to have an Allergic reaction from sitting at the dirty sticky table.

Get prime rib, server gives me a large end cut. I get mashed potatoes and gravy and some veggies. When I turn the end cut over it is the tail of the roast and nothing, I mean nothing but fat. DISGUSTING! The potatoes are not mashed, but huge chunks of potatoes that take three bites to eat and the fake smoke was so strong I couldn't stomach them. The veggies came straight out of a frozen bag and had no taste, but the texture was definitely that of frozen veggies can only have. Next trip tried the beef again and the server was cutting it with the grain. He carved a perfectly good peice of meat the wrong way and ruined it. I ate very little, not worth the cost at all.

My friend ate seafood, heard overcooked, okay, nothing special, we both left. I left a small tip for the server, but wouldn't go back on a dare.... Awful experience at a Harrah's property."}
{"text":"I will give them 1 star for providing substance. However the buffet is over-priced, the food tastes like freezer food, and is extremely dried out and needs to be switched out! Wow to the yuckness!!!!"}
{"text":"I did not purchase the seafood add on, just the regular buffet. I ate dinner here, as well as brunch the following day. 

A lot of the brunch food was the same as dinner the night before. That was a little disappointing, but overall we had a good experience. There is an enormous selection at this buffet, from traditional meats and potatoes to a build your own Asian soup counter. 

The staff was great. I have food allergies and buffets are kind of a nightmare for me but the folks working at each station were very knowledgeable about ingredients and very accommodating. 

My favorites from our visit were the prime rib, honey baked ham, roasted veggies, and their sweet potatoes. For brunch, they have a couple of cooked to order counters and one of the cooks made my son an adorable Mickey Mouse pancake that he devoured, so that was a huge win. 

All in all, I would eat here again, despite the sort of steep price tag."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Came for Sunday brunch not much open.  Very limited selection of food .  Mediocre at best. I have had better at other casinos for half the price."}
{"text":"This review covers two things:  The brunch and their \"promos,\" both of which are 1 star.

Who is in charge of your marketing/print marketing for your Buffet? Whoever it is, I strongly recommend having them attend a writing course on the proper use of the ampersand symbol (&) which means \"AND\"

Your Memorial Day Weekend Buffet promo said \"Brunch & Dinner $38.99\".  After paying for 6 people, and after making all of the 6 people suffer by eating a horrible, tasteless, dry, bland brunch, I was told by the rude cashier staff that I would have to pay ANOTHER 6x $38.99 for dinner. Even though the sign said \"BRUNCH AND DINNER\" NOT brunch OR dinner.

If the ampersand symbol (&) means OR then using that logic: Does that mean burger & fries for $5.99 means the burger is $5.99 and another $5.99 for fries? Does that mean steak & mashed potatoes for $59 means the steak is $59 and another $59 for mashed potatoes? 

While I believe it was unintentional, this was a false advertisement. You do not use the ampersand symbol in place of the word \"OR\".  I'll try adding the photo of your advertisement to your page.  

So in conclusion:  The brunch here sucks and I wouldn't know how the dinner taste because I was not going to pay another $200+ for a false promo."}
{"text":"Sea food is 50 plus tax . They seated us in a private  section. The wait was only 10 minutes  . Last time it was over an hour . The food was fresh . The crab legs and shrimp was good . The shrimp  tempura  was very good . Tried theirs  roast duck . Hugh selection . Good Gelato"}
{"text":"Best seafood buffet in Vegas hands down!!! My husband and I love our buffets and we will back for sure!! Best choices and varieties by far. Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is, this is worth your money! Honestly! Seafood all you want, all types of food and desserts. Fancy, I thought. Great service. I loved this place. It's definitely a must on the agenda on our next trip to Vegas! Oh just a quick note, if your on a diet, I'd recommend you dropping it before entering this place lol"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years but never again. Must have changed hands. Came to the buffet to get the crab legs.I know they have two sides to the buffet as they combined the seafood buffet together with the regular buffet.But they offered crab legs on both sides before.  Now you can only get crab legs if you pay an extra 20.00 on top of the 32.99. One other comment is that servers use to give you your drinks now they have soda machines and you get your own. When you go to Vegas and pay 32.99 for a buffet you don't expect to get your own soda, that cheapens your experience  You can go to your local 9.99  buffet and get your own soda. So right now I'm sitting watching my son eat his food and I got a refund. They only offer dinner now no breakfast or lunch. I hope the new owners take a look at these reviews and change things back to how they use to be. Satisfied customers keep you in business."}
{"text":"It's been two years since we tried the buffet. It was a little chaotic  checking in. There is plenty of choices. Seafood is an extra twenty dollars . Seafood was ok lobster was small but very tough. Crab cake was good . Service was good and attentive . Some of the noodles were sitting for a while . Plenty of deserts. . Bring an appetite"}
{"text":"It's okay for a buffet. We had to bring in our own homemade sauce and that made it bombasfk. Lol. Other than that just stick to the seafood."}
{"text":"Not worth the money... Paid extra for the seafood only to find out the seafood I enjoy(cold) is available without paying the extra $20. What did I get for that extra $20 you may ask.?. Some lukewarm crab legs and over cooked finger tip size morsels of lobster tail. Don't even get me started on the dessert... if I could give no stars, I would. 

Ps... the mashed potatoes where the consistency of potato soup."}
{"text":"We had dinner there today, very disappointing. Food was NOT GOOD at all. Desserts were ok. Too expensive, not worth it. Used to be one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. Not anymore."}
{"text":"Great selection of food offerings! All the food was fresh and high quality in my view. We had an amazing waiter who promptly cleared our plates and checked on us frequently to ensure we were have a great experience. One of the better buffets in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The only reason I came to this buffet was because everyone said it was good and it was also featured on the travel channel as one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. Well it was the complete opposite. I paid $40 and it was a complete regret. The food was absolutely disgusting. I am an enthusiast of prime rib and this was the most disgusting prime rib I have ever tasted. The meat tasted old and everything there was extremely salty. Not to mention the booths and tables were so nasty I don't know how people can sit in them. Please save your money and eat somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Huge selection, food tasted great!   2nd time here and it does not disappoint.  You can take free shuttle from Harrahs to rio. Also if  you there about 230 you just pay $25 and you won't be hungry for the rest of the day.  Dessert was my favorite and first time trying Gelato,  never  knew what I was missing but they have a great selection!"}
{"text":"I dont understand the low rated reviews.  This buffet was the best I've ever had.  Went for dinner on a Friday evening.  We opted for the seafood add on which we were glad we added!  So good!  You get the option to choose from one whole lobster of 5 lobster tails.  The fried shrimp, shrimp scampi was so delish.  Apart from this section, all the food selections were awesome!  So much to choose from.  And make sure you save room for dessert!  So many options to choose from.  My favorite was the tiramisu.  Definitely my new go-to buffet in Vegas."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am not too sure why this place has such a low rating.  I enjoyed myself here very much and for the price I payed, I would say even more so.

Multiple locals we asked recommended this buffet, so it must be good right!?  And it was!  The day before this, we went to the Bacchanal because it was crowned the best buffet. But I feel like this one had more variety for a similar price. 

We got the seafood buffet pass around 4ish and I feel I ate my money's worth. There were lobster tails, crawfish, oysters, various types of fishes, clams, crab, and basically all the seafood you normally see but don't want to buy them all at the same time. 

The regular buffet was also pretty good. Although some feel like they were less fresh, the variety of food makes this place worth it."}
{"text":"The menu has changed so much. We came for dinner & it appears as though they have less variety of food...the macaroni & cheese was bland, they only had chicken wings & they would deplete fast...the past Alfredo sauce was mediocre....& the cheese for nachos was horrible.."}
{"text":"I would have given this 0 stars if possible.  This was the most disgusting buffet I have ever been to.  At $50 for the seafood buffet, it may be the biggest ripoff in Vegas.  Tasteless and cold food, not to mention seeing multiple people putting their hands in the food instead of using the tongs.  I witnessed one woman putting her finger in the salad dressing to taste it before she put it on her salad and unsupervised kids reaching into the food, despite multiple signs asking people not to touch the food.  Have to search through multiple plates to find a clean one.  Fork with tines going in multiple directions.  No need to \"upgrade\" to the seafood since crab legs, shrimp, and sushi are at the regular buffet also - just have to run for it because people dome their plates up when new food is put out.  I would never eat here again, even if it was free."}
{"text":"Food selection is not as great. The roast beef was tough. Price is exorbitant. I don't think I need to add more."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and my last. Came a couple of years ago and it was pretty good. We revisited 2 weeks ago and it has gone way down hill. Most of the food did not seem fresh, looked and some tasted like it was reheated from the day before. Not great options in my opinion, even the salad area had very minimal options. Just your run of the mill buffet and the price is still very high for what you actually get."}
{"text":"This buffet is huge! Endless options to choose from. Save big by buying the Groupon for a discount on the seafood buffet, which gets you the choice between one whole lobster or 2 lobster tails and 2 alcoholic beverages (wine, beer, or well mixed drink). The servers there are more so there to just collect your finished plates and, depending on where you're seated, you have to walk all the way across the room to get non-alcoholic beverages. There is a full bar as well. By far the best dessert selection I've seen and I've been to many a buffet in Vegas. Take me back!"}
{"text":"By far away the worst experience ever!!! Paid for 9 people to eat and added the extra seafood area stamp for an extra $30 each. I waited 15 minutes from the time I paid until we got seated and watched 5 parties that paid after us get seated before us. There is no service... they occasionally take your used plates but they make you get your own drinks. The food was on par with cafeteria food and the extra seafood area was horrible and inedible, the general buffet had better seafood without the extra cost. The buffet itself just looks rundown. The temperature of the room was so hot that we were all sweating and it made my grandmother physically ill. When I tried to voice my concerns to the staff I was brushed off, sent to 4 different people, laughed at, and shown no actual concern. It's one thing to have a one off night but the lack of service and interest I received tells me this is just the standard for this place. We went the next to Red Rock station buffet and for about 300 dollars less had a better experience in every way. DO NOT GO TO RIO FOR THE BUFFET!"}
{"text":"So disappointed, that things have changed so drastically. We were here last night for the regular buffet,  again stilllnonky a star or two. Tonight here Fer the seafood and sorry we made that choice. They limit yiu to one lobster,  I wasn't given a claw so when I went to ask them for a claw they responded with do you have your ticket,  I said no I already got on e but can I have one of those claws,  o was told no that they all came with claws and if it doesn't they guve you one. I said twice I never got one and they again responded with sorry. Basically said I was lying. Pictures showed sushi, no sushi to be found with exception of poki. Yelp pictures show sushi. We won't be back, will spread the word since we are part time locals"}
{"text":"I went for the snow crab legs. They were the worst of my life, no salt not sweet, strange looking, tasted just awful, so plain, so weird. I told the waiter he said he's got a lot of complaints and will talk to the manager tomorrow at the meeting.   100 bucks down the drain. It was our 14th year wedding anniversary.  We took the kids as they have been wanting to go to buffet for a long time, we're locals to Vegas almost 20 years. A few hours after we got home my 10 year old was vomiting all over his room. Thanks Rio for the lasting memory. You should be shut down!"}
{"text":"Great service from Robert and bottomless mimosas made brunch on Father's Day weekend perfect!"}
{"text":"Honestly, only come here if you're stranded at Rio and it would be difficult for you to get to essentially any other food place. 

Seafood upgrade: protip: have only one person in your group get the upgrade. When you pay the extra $20, all you really get is either 1 big lobster or 6 puny lobster tails - neither which is worth because they're awfully dry. Then you can go in and out as many times as you please to get the rest of the food from the seafood bar, which all kind of suck, aside from the hot crab legs. So just have the one person in the group walk in and get all the crab legs! 

The rest: this buffet truly is a jack of all trades, master of none, if by jack of a trade you mean that you completely suck at the trade. There are food options from every region but each one is lackluster and unappealing. Honestly the only redeeming quality is the gelato dessert station, and that's about it.  Save your money, save your time, basically what every review you've read about this place."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing buffet I have been to. I am a local and I admittedly haven't been to the buffet since they combined the seafood buffet too. I cannot believe people pay $15 extra dollars for the seafood. The whole price was outrageous for what poor food quality you get. And for the price I have to get my own drink ? Forget it. I will never be back. I feel bad for tourists who don't know there are way better choices for the price."}
{"text":"You'd probably like this place if you don't know anything about food.
Extremely over priced and the food quality is terrible. 

You can go see for yourself but I'm just trying to avoid you the anger of a massive bill and disappointing dining experience. $45 a person for a shitty meal."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite Las Vegas Buffets. However on my last trip things changed. They deluxe seafood buffet is now right next to this buffet for a big additional charge you get items that used to be included in this buffet. No more shrimp and the crab legs are tiny and have very little meat inside. I ate here as part of the buffet of buffets pass. Next time I will stay om the strip."}
{"text":"My better half and I could not mutually agree on what we want to eat for dinner.  My thoughts say, \"Wanna save money, order regular buffet.\"  His tummy says, \"Wanna splurge, go for seafood buffet.\"  Here we come with our clean plates. There's so many options to choose from depending on type of ethnic foods available.  I crave for some tacos while my husband takes great pleasure in crabs and lobsters.  Majority of dishes taste mediocre.  

Indecisive which pho, ramen or soup to eat, there's a set up complete with your choice of noodles, broth, toppings, and condiments available.  So far, this is my preferred station. 

Green tea and coconut gelato looks very appealing from afar; however, I am appalled by tasting super soft, slightly melted treat. 

When quantity versus quality sounds appealing at the present moment, dine here.  Need a restroom in close proximity, you've found your destination."}
{"text":"Wow, how the mighty have fallen.

A few years ago this was the best buffet I'd ever tried in Vegas.  It was consistently good, fresh, hot, and amazing.... but now it's simply trash.  Overpriced, underwhelming, bland, and simply disgusting.

I'd select zero stars if it were possible.  We went here 2 days ago with a group of 12.  We paid about $120 per couple and left after 20 minutes.  Even with the all you can drink beer and wine option and seafood option...No one enjoyed it.

Needless to say we will never return..."}
{"text":"Robert was super nice and super attentive! Cheers to Robert! Made our carnival experience better than expected!"}
{"text":"The reviews are all correct. The food is hideous.
Walk across the street and get a slightly better buffet for $13."}
{"text":"What's to expect really, it's a buffet, so no world class food here. Just a large amount of meh food. Pizza was meh, general tso chicken was meh, baked potatoe was meh, and the mashed potatoe tasted like fish. The buffet was also expensive  (35 bucks per person), the food wasn't good enough for that price. The servers were nice, but slow to get stuff (took 30 minutes to pick up some plates) and the chef staff was rood, yelling at me for no reason. The buffet was also split up with a seafood side (don't get it, there's seafood in the normal buffet). Overall, it just wasn't great, I heard the win has a good buffet, go there."}
{"text":"Large selection of seafood, oysters,mussels, crab, lobster and lobster bisque be sure to add extra lobster! Sushi all very fresh!  The servers are very attentive, very friendly.  Loved the chicken satay, meat on a stick,super tender and tasty. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not 5 stars was the Mexican foods were cold soggy and just not worth eating, but again there was so much other really great stuff, like prime rib, roast beef, turkey the BBQ short ribs so it's is well worth the price.  Desserts again were just plain, the items with crusts were soggy, nothing in the chocolate selections, but had a few with chocolate in them, but then I'm not a big sweets fan, however I love a cream burlee  or chocolate molten cake they don't offer this.  All in all I will continue to eat here because the seafood is very good quality!"}
{"text":"Giving Robert a 5 Star. Such a great server. He kept our glasses full & even brought strawberry pancakes to our table. Food was good & service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"I seem to recall this being better 4 years ago.

The GOOD:

- Selection is decent

- Gelato bar for dessert

- Cupcakes, cheesecakes, mousse desserts, pie, etc around the gelato bar

- Soft drinks included in price

- Waiting staff was friendly and helpful. We were checked on frequently enough, but never annoyed.

The BAD:

- No direction when you walk in. You're supposed to be escorted to a table, but we paid at the register, then were told to enjoy the meal, and no one was around to take us to our table. Were we supposed to wait somewhere else? Perhaps they handle this better when there is more of a crowd.

- The food quality and selection seem to not be what I remember.

Pork belly had some strange layer of (I assume) fat that was so seared it was like biting into the dental paper they put in your mouth when you get a filling. It hurt to try to bite through it. Almost like it was never meant to be eaten.

The (Mongolian?) grill station was disappointing. They keep the grill low (at least at non-peak times) so that you have to wait something like 5 minutes for your food to be done. So...what, you wait there? Go back to your seat? Do they get annoyed if your food is waiting? The low heat I think also affects the texture of the finished meal, including the sauce being too watery because the water doesn't evaporate. Speaking of which, you don't really get a choice about your sauce. The ingredients are very limited, nothing really got seared for me (again, maybe due to keeping the grill low for non-peak hours?), the lady working the grill wasn't terribly friendly...just not good.

The Asian beef and such wasn't very well done. Almost flavorless and overdone, making it a chore to eat. The fried rice was better, but still not great. And when you don't have good meat and sauce to go with it, it's a real letdown.

They do have crab legs and shrimp for you even if you don't pay for the seafood buffet.

The other standard buffet fare -- pizza, meatballs, rolls -- none of it was terribly special. Some of it was good, solid buffet food, but nothing I'd rave about.

There are some minor annoyances. One server at the gelato bar gave overflowing cups out. Which is great, but then it leaves no room for the (only two or three options of) toppings. The next server gave out only single scoops which meant you had to return to the bar more frequently.

NOTES:

- To take the shuttle from Harrah's, you'll probably want to drive (depending on where you're coming from) and park in Harrah's free parking garage. The shuttle is then near the garage exit. The buses aren't clearly marked as they come through, and the shuttle to the Rio comes by about every 30 minutes, without any real schedule or any way of knowing how soon it will arrive. The same thing with returning from the Rio -- you might want to leave the buffet in time to catch the shuttle, but you have no idea when the shuttle will arrive, in which case you might wish you'd stayed a bit longer to eat more gelato.

OVERALL:

I'm pretty disappointed. Some of the food was good, but selection and quality were lacking. Again, my expectations were set about 4 years ago when I was at this buffet. It's possible my memory is off, but I recall being much happier the first time around. Compared to a normal buffet, like your typical Chinese buffet, or Hometown Buffet, or even Golden Corral, I think you'll be pretty disappointed.

Or maybe we just came on a bad day with lousy selection and bad cooks working.

We came here recommending it to friends, but left feeling a bit embarrassed with how unsatisfying it was.

Years ago, I would have recommended this place. Now? I'd recommend checking out the Wynn buffet...or, really, any other place than this. *sigh*"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this ZERO stars.

WOW - the quality here has gone WAY DOWN.

Not just bad - terrible. The staff here really has gone out of their way to find low quality food - and the price is HIGH!

EXAMPLES:

The carved meat looks & tastes like a roasted shoe.

The coffee is room temp, and comes with Coffee Mate - not real cream.

The shrimp cocktail are TINY and slimy and dirty looking - you can't find shrimp this low quality in a store, but the RIO has found it.

If ANY of this food was in a restaurant - you would never go there.

AND the service was non existent.

We did not splurge for the seafood upgrade - and I'm glad we didn't - as THREE separate parties around us (!) complained about the low quality & got refunds.

Do your self a favor - skip this dump."}
{"text":"I have visited this Buffet every year for the past four years and have enjoyed them all. We make it a point to go twice while vacationing in Las Vegas. We love the seafood variety, fresh fruits, and deserts. The new self-serve beverage station offers a plethora of thirst quenching flavors. The Manager,  Mr. D.J., was extremely kind and his warmth enhanced the calm ambiance during our dining experience. He made my Aunt's Birthday celebration a memorable one. We may have to extend our vacation next year in order to fit in a total of 3 visits."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 stars, I would. Long lines, extremely overpriced, rude and incompetent staff, and everyone in my party had the worst food poisoning ever! I pretty much paid $140 for the 3 of us to spend the night fighting like the hunger games for the bathroom. Never again. And if you value your insides, I'd keep walking too"}
{"text":"Price under the word seafood was 31.99, I go to pay 64.50 wtf?  Oh that's the price if you want seafood. No thanks I walked out."}
{"text":"Omggggg the best buffet we went to while in vegas!!! Yes there was a little wait  about 20-25mins but I promise you it was so worth it!!! Our total for 2 without the seafood section was $71.00 if we wanted the seafood part it would be $30 more....the normal buffet has the crab legs, shrimp and crawfish so I was just fine without the seafood extra."}

It used to be a real nice buffet.
We both got sick after eating here.
U have to pay $20pp extra if u want oysters n lobter (that makes $52pp and id rather go to caesars)
Really sad how this place became bad.  The buffer quality is now $15pp although they charge $32pp"}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinning out especially to great seafood restaurant. Rio is one of the casino in Vegas that offers lobsters however, it's limited to only those who paid additional for the seafood and it's limited 1 per guest, which I find not a great deal since you paid $20 more per person and the only real difference is the 1 extra lobster. Other than that, the regular buffet is decent with the pricing."}
{"text":"Good variety and great service

Robert was awesome - he made sure my glass was never empty even though I was sitting at the end of the seating area

Desert selection is pretty amazing too!"}
{"text":"If you were expecting the king of buffets by coming to this place, you were way off. The quality of each food choice they have here does not justify the price by any means. Do yourself a favor, you have been to a buffet before right? This is exactly like that but way more expensive. I do notbmind one bit spending good money on good food, but i feel like this place got over on me-big time. I will only be going to cook to order restaurants from here on out for my stay in vegas-i suggest you do the same. The sushi bar is a joke- only generic rolls that you could buy pre-packaged from the grocery store. The seafood area (which costs more to have access to) is far from worthy for the additional charge. Heed my warnings friends, save your money or blow itbon gambling and eat taco bell or something, youll feel the same afterwards."}
{"text":"Our waiter Wally was great the Lobster is very overrated but the service made up for it"}
{"text":"We had ad the worst customer service experience at the Carnival buffet at Rio. It started off with a line that started out the door. We kept waiting because we thought it wouldn't be longer than 15-20 minutes. Once we made it inside, we realized that they had set up Disneyland-style lines that wound round and round, but we were already committed and not knowing how much longer it would be, we stayed in the line. We ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes just to get in. 

When we complained to the manager at the front, Courtney, about the long wait, she became immediately hostile, threatened to kick us out and said she had enough to deal with that night and didn't have to deal with us. She then said that the buffet wait was even longer at the Bellagio - like that justified the long wait we just dealt with. (Courtney, if you're reading this- it doesn't. We weren't at the Bellagio for a reason and it's pathetic that your standards are to be just above the worst. A good manager aims higher.)

We ended up having to down our meal in less than 45 minutes because we had a Penn and Teller show to go to (which, we were late to), so we didn't really get to enjoy the food. That being said, what we ate was good and they had a pretty decent selection. I was glad we didn't do the seafood option. It seemed like there was plenty on our side of the buffet and we still got crab legs and shrimp."}
{"text":"Wanted to go to bacchanal buffet but decided to come here due to time constraints. 

I figured most buffets are decent, but the quality of food reminds me of hometown buffet (or what I imagine it to be since I never go there). Nothing really looked or tasted appetizing. 

All I can say is I regret not going to bacchanal... The employees are nice though."}
{"text":"We went there today for my Dad's birthday celebration and it was surprisingly disappointing from the front desk customer service to the quality and taste of food. The receptionist was not friendly at all and the food is not fresh. There was 7 of us and we all upgraded to the $50 fee for the seafood all you can eat, however most of the food at the seafood buffet are inclusive if you pay for the $35 regular price only, of which could have been explained at the front if the lady could have been a little accommodating. Also, there was a whole area of empty tables when we came, and we were seated all the way back near the restroom! Anyway, definitely the last visit!"}
{"text":"I was shocked with the 2.5 star rating of the seafood buffet, I said to my self this can't be right, I experienced so many delightful experiences throughout the years at the seafood buffet, when I went with my brother in law, I was shocked with the selections they have and the quality of the seafood that was less than adequate, the lobster was overcooked and the crab legs were also overcooked and very small, the variety of the seafood was limited, I would never go back till they change the executive chef or the food and beverage manager, they also need to change the way you get your own drinks, plastic glasses and cups are not acceptable!!!"}
{"text":"Really one of the worst meals I've ever had. Where to start. Lobster very dry. King crab legs small and so soggy the shells didn't crack you had to kinda tear them apart. Most everything else had absolutely no taste including prime rib, mac & cheese and cheese cake!
One star because I had to. All the staff was very friendly and they included a glass of champagne. Ended up eating a little sushi and spicy and sweet soup with scallions. Last time we came to the Rio the seafood buffet was at the other side of the casino and was superb. We don't often do seafood buffets since my husband doesn't eat seafood. But he happily pays for seafood buffets because of my love for it. What a shame! We were asked at the end of the meal how it was and we kinda shrugged and we both said \"eh...ok.\" The young lady didn't know how to reply so she just walked away. We will never go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here on Friday early evening. We had the dinner for $34.99 each (didn't not pop for the extra $20 seafood upgrade). Wow, have times changed! I went here probably 20 years ago and remember it had many international foods to choose from. Not anymore! Our choices were Chinese, a meager salad bar, and a carving station with some American sides. The upside was the food was decently prepared and the desserts were very good. The people that paid for the seafood upgrade all seemed happy as they came back to their tables with plates loaded down with crab legs and lobster tails. However, if you are not into seafood, I would skip this buffet entirely."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Paid $57 for both the seafood and the standard Carnival buffet. The seafood buffet left a lot to be desired. Years ago the seafood buffet was fantastic. It looks the the entire Rio resort has gone downhill. I would have rated it 1 star but the standard Carnival buffet was ok which resulted in my 2 star rating."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the breakfast buffet. Came here for breakfast, since I had passes for my stay, and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Remember to never to go to hotel buffets without coupons or passes, there's always something!

Anyways, the breakfast buffet was great. Lots of food selection, an omelet station, a pancake station, and many breakfast pastries! Funny enough, eating at this breakfast buffet was one of my fav places to eat in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The buffet is good compared to the chain buffets out there but the price is a little on the high side. The service was pretty OKish. If I was really hungry, I would go but you have to be a good eater to get the best out of this place"}
{"text":"I've been waiting in line for 2 hours. My feet are sore, my stomach is eating itself, and this is an overall horrible experience. 
I can see tons of uncleared tables. They haven't been cleared in 30 minutes. Also, it's been another 20 minutes and the line hasn't moved AT ALL. (Not to mention a family of 20 cut in line)
I am NEVER coming back to this buffet no matter what. 

Oh look. What's this? MORE UNCLEARED TABLES. Now that I'm close enough to look at the majority of the tables, 1/4 of the customers already left and their tables AREN'T CLEARED. WHY IS YOUR SERVICE SO BAD. WHY DIDN'T I KNOW THIS BEFORE I CHOOSE TO EAT HERE.

UPDATE
As I was seated, I remember I had eaten here once before (WHY DIDN'T I REMEMBER). Anyway, I've just finished eating and I have to say, it was exactly as I remembered it: disappointing. The mac n cheese tasted bland; the pizza was unappetizing; a classmate from my Food Service and Hospitality class can make enchiladas much better than the one served. The only thing worth 'praising' is their mash potatoes with gravy, though it hardened before I even take a bite. The only thing that was satisfying was the ice cream. 

CONCLUSION
PROS
   1. Good mashed potatoes with gravy even though it hardened before I could eat it
   2. Great ice cream
   3. Variety of foods & desserts
   4. They have a bar

CONS
   1. You tip at the register
   2. Some food tastes bland
   3. Bad service (Slow clean up time, no attention)
   4. They turned off the music halfway through our meal
   5. 2.5hr waiting time standing"}
{"text":"We came to this place with high expectations, having eaten here in the past.  The food quality was decent, but...

There is kind of a \"shell game\" going on with the buffet here--pardon the pun.  The prices can vary a bit, but the \"regular\" buffet is about $35 and the \"seafood\" buffet is considerably more--around $50.  

We were told the seafood buffet had crab legs and lobster.  Well, sort of.  The \"lobster\" is not lobster tail, but a medley of some sort with chunked up pieces of lobster tail (still in the shell too).  If you were hoping for just lobster and drawn butter--no.  There were a lot of cold crab legs, but then we realized--the crab legs are on the regular buffet too!

When we inquired with a manager, we were told that the snow crab legs on the seafood buffet were larger and off a higher quality than those on the regular buffet.  I didn't see that, and I'm not buying it!  After we complained, we got a refund of the \"seafood\" buffet upcharge.

So...be warned -- the regular buffets is likely what you want.  If you are not sure, take a good look first!"}
{"text":"Long lines and food was average. It was not good. Expensive. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I went crazy over the fact that they had crispy pork, satay skewers & roast duck! I loved it. Went on a Sunday afternoon so the seafood section wasn't open yet til dinner. But $33 bucks wasn't too bad. They had crab legs too. They had pho & other noodle soup option there as well. Pho wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Since moving in with the Carnival World Buffet, the Seafood Buffet has really gone down hill. Went there last night and was very disappointed. The selection was very small and the food was luke warm at best. The only saving grace was that you got both buffets included in the price, hence the two star rating. My suggestion is to not waste $50 per.person on the Seafood Buffet at the Rio."}
{"text":"This had to be the worse buffet in Vegas.  DO NOT GO. For 2 people, I did get the upgrade for the lobster (supposed to be one whole lobster or 5 tails----well 5 extremely small halves)  and it cost $91.00.   Ues that's right $91.00.  The wait staff were not friendly or very helpful.  You had to get your own drinks and just not really interested.  The dessert was dry.  DO NOT GO!!!"}
{"text":"Came to this buffet after numerous recommendations from concierge and uber drivers and was not disappointed. I can see why it was recommended. The line looked long upon getting here but it moved really fast.  After a couple selfies and group picture (rio staff takes picture and presents printed copy for purchase) It was time time to pay and be seated. We did decide to go with the seafood package because it wouldn't be the Vegas package without it. We were promptly seated and our food ventures began. Everything was amazing. There is not one thing I grabbed that I didn't love. The best part were the bottomless mimosas and the crab legs. Their seafood section is divine! To die for! 3rd day of our stay not we have been to numerous buffets, Rios buffet was our favorite! DJ was awesome. He attended us numerous times! From walking to our table to make sure we were being well taken care of to stepping in and seating us promptly when he heard there was a party of 8 to stepping into the bar line to help it run faster when he saw it was getting long. I would return to Rio everyday just to get the great service he provided all over again. I will be recommending to all friend and family because DJ made our buffet experience amazing! Hands down best buffet in Vegas! Thanks DJ!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite. I will hesitate to say that I've found a replacement, because I haven't... it just isn't what it used to be. The variety and the quality of the food has gone down drastically. I appreciate the pho station. That is nice. I like that the teppanyaki station is still there, but the portions are smaller snd the chef would not let me pick my sauce as in the past. The roast turkey was dry. I would have liked to see more vegetable dishes. Maybe a curry... oh and the dessert station. Oh dear. Horrendous. I got a plate full of these beautiful little morsels... couldn't eat a thing. All dry. If they had tasted half as good as they looked it would have been nice. I settled on a scoop of gelato. Overall, the price is hefty for stir fry and ice cream but once a year isn't bad."}
{"text":"The food gone downhill. The prime rib is overly salty. So was there menudo soup. The servers are rude. I sat there for a hour and the server only came once to our table. There open bar has a wide select of red and white wines."}
{"text":"Definitely worth checking out. You get your money's worth. Seafood is available without the upgrades, but with the upgrade you get more crab, lobster, crawfish, oysters, mussels, clams, and more! Line is long, but moved quickly. Save room for dessert. Their selection is outta control! Bread pudding and gelato!!! Come prepared to eat!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could leave a no star rating because there was not one thing that this place did to deserve the one star. First let me say that I would not eat the fish/seafood part of there buffet. I did not but my wife did and she ended up in the emergency room the next day with food poisoning     This was confirmed by the ER Doctor at the desert springs hospital!! We paid $82 for two dinners and the food was horrible, all the meat was dry, and everything had that steam table taste!  We went at 9 pm so there was no reason that thinks we're not fresh!  I just don't understand why it was this bad. My wife said the same thing about the seafood, it just didn't taste right!  The prime rib was a very poor cut and the ham was dry!  The wait staff was slow and it was still $7 for a beer after paying $82 for dinner!  Guys keep your money in your pocket on this one it is not worth it!
Let me say this, this is the first one star that I'm giving and I'm not a hard person to make happy!"}
{"text":"First time here at this buffet and it was AMAZING!!!
The food was fresh, great tasting and a great variety, but definitely the highlight of our experience was Robert our waiter!!!! He was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"what the hell? purchase buffet of buffet and they close for lunch??? RIP OFF..., I am going to get a refund. How the hell they sell all day buffet and they close half of the day."}
{"text":"This buffet is no good for now, needed to add $25 more on top 32.99 to eat seafood? Suck"}
{"text":"What a disgrace. Its bad enough to lose in the casino but to get robbed in the buffet. Its no wonder why they stoped both breakfast and lunch. This was once a locals favorite buffet in 1997 with the seafood buffet being where the kiss golf is today with unlimited slippery lobster tails and lines that were an hour to two long. They moved it to their regular buffet with an upcharge of twenty dollars making it more than the old buffet and giving less. The quality of the food has gone from some of the best to a terrible herbs buffet . The onlything worst than the food is the attitudes of the employees in the buffet(cashiers, staff checking for stamp for seafood upgrade, waiters) No one wants to do there job anymore, no one takes pride in there work. At this point as a local and a diamond card holder do everyone a favor stop robbing us and just close the worst total rewards buffet in the country down. By the way teach your staff the difference between slippery lobster tail and half lobster tails and all you can eat buffet means all you can eat not your chose of a two ounce lobster with no claws or five small pieces of a half of a lobster tail. Like i said disgrace, ive been getting 6 ounce lobster tails for 3.99 to 5.99 each at albertsons, vons,and glasiers that were top quality since april, why should i give you 20.00 on top of the 32.99 buffet that used to come with crab legs. Orleans friday night seafood is only 25.00 and has huge split down the center crab legs. You have competing casinos all around you. Your not a strip casino you count on locals just like the gold coast and palms, try remembering that before you end up like the sahara, desert inn, landmark, etc."}
{"text":"Last night we went to the Rio Carnival buffet in Las Vegas for the first time since they changed to Rio Buffet and Seafood combined. I noticed on Yelp they have a two and a half star overall. I give it a four star because they made improvements to their selections. On the Carnival side of the restaurant the improvements are made-to-order order food. You can have a made-to-order burrito, tacos, stir fry, burgers,  grilled cheese, and sandwiches. Having made-to-order items is a plus in my book. The food was tasty and was not bland. I did enjoy the carnival side. On the other hand the seafood side of the buffet was not so hot. I expected a bigger selection on the seafood side because when they were separated the Rio seafood buffet had a lot more options. Now, on the seafood side they had hot and cold crab legs and they had very big crab leg claws that had a lot of meat in them. They also had a medley of lobster tails but they weren't big lobster tails they were small and they were in a buttery type sauce. On the seafood side of the buffet they also had asparagus, oysters, crawfish, shrimp cocktail, warm shrimps, and rolls. I do not think I would pay the extra $15 for the seafood side of the buffet again. I think I would rather stick to the carnival side of the buffet. What I did notice was that on the Carnival side of the buffet the crab legs were very skinny; they looked like they had no meat in them. However on the seafood side of the buffet the crab legs were a lot more meatier. The price for the Rio Carnival buffet was $34.99 for dinner and if you wanted to add the seafood side of the buffet  it was an extra $15 per person. We would definitely go back but we would purchase the Carnival buffet without the seafood side.  If they expand their seafood selection I would consider paying for it."}
{"text":"Okay buffet.  It does have a nice selection but found nothing to stand out as giving this buffet a high recommendation.  Also found the cost a bit higher but quality average.   They did have a nice selection of Chinese food."}
{"text":"One word....overpriced. The people who work here are really friendly though. The desserts were delicious and they do have a variety of food here. The best part was the Japanese tepanyaki where you fill up a bowl with items you want and someone cooks it with your choice of meat (chicken, shrimp, beef). The regular buffet was about $33 and if you wanted seafood included it would be an additional $20. Almost $60 per person. A little too much for me. You're better off going to any other buffet since most buffets already include seafood with the price. 
Save yourself some money and hit up another buffet for $30+ that already includes seafood.  You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Robert P. was our wait staff at the Carnival Rio Buffet. Two days in row. Amazing service. 5-star."}
{"text":"Was at the rio carnival buffet 11/25 as always when in Vegas..... Disappointed that they didn't honor local discount, however got a $5.00 discount & a $1.00 player discount..... also they did not honor lunch prices but charged the holiday $38.00 brunch price.... Was very disappointed with the quality of food this time at some section.... The prime ribs always a favorite was so red 
i heard a moo .... it was as tough as shoe leather.... only side dish was mash potato no other sides no veggi's    leftover stuffing in section....   ribeye  steaks was overcooked & tough.... going on to the skewer section it looked like it was leftovers from the previous day.... the noodle section was great no complaints    try the wonton soup   add chicken, green onions crispy noodles  go to the chinese & add the barbecue pork to the soup... the chinese section is the best    they should expand it more especially the dim sum only su mai pork w/blk bean sauce , buns.... the roast duck you just can't find the meat... the dessert section has vastly improved since my last visit... before they had cookies, pies & gelato now they have a wider selection of sweets  but still features gelatto  no real ice cream"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Showed up on Friday night with a coupon from the buffet. Waited in line for 20 minutes, when I got to the front I was told that they weren't accepting coupons tonight (no signs or anything). I asked \"Why?\" the cashier said it was because it was a holiday weekend. I said \"What holiday?\" She said that Sunday was Easter so they weren't taking coupons on Friday. 
WHAT???
1. A sign or something would've been nice, it would've saved me standing in line for 20 minutes.
2. The coupon didn't say anything about not being valid on holiday weekends.
I left and went to a different restaurant in the Rio. I will never go back to the Rio buffet, nor will I recommend it to anyone. There are a plethora of places to eat in Vegas, I have no idea why they would want to turn away customers in such a rude fashion. If you are going to print a coupon, honor it. If you're going to have stipulations about the FRIDAY BEFORE EASTER, then mention it before I waste my time in line.
I hope you're happy, Buffett manager. You saved $15 from not honoring my coupon, but you lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. They had two old ladies per cash register and it took us forever to get seated, even though the restaurant is half empty. Food quality has went way, way down since the last time I came here (2 years ago). The food doesn't seem fresh and I don't think it's worth the price."}
{"text":"visiting out of town. Didn't stay at the rio hotel ..but the buffet use to be great! but now has gone DOWNHILL. the variety of food sucked ass if i didn't get the seafood buffet i would have still been hungry. nothing looked appetizing..like i don't know what kind of food that was. my boyfriend didnt enjoy any food either and he didn't get the seafood buffet smh only thing good was the dessert bar and thats what gave this place one star. it's overpriced for the quality and you'll get way better food at the wicked spoon buffet by far. LIKE THE OTHRS SAID don't waste your time or money here WARNING! hope this helps someone. Big DISAPPOINTMENT. i will never be back."}

{"text":"Don't waste your money! Tried the seafood buffet (inflated holiday special price of $60+)  on July 4th and was terribly disappointed. Their \"lobster\" option was an unappealing bowl of chopped shells and no meat. Not even sure they were really lobster shells. They were a mix of mostly gray and translucent pink, not the bright red I'm used to seeing in New England. They looked more like oversized deformed toenails than half lobster tails. 

All the shrimp dishes, though colored differently, tasted exactly the same. It was like someone boiled a young garlic plant and added food coloring and bits of grass and dirt. I managed to down one of their raw oysters but it was so odd in texture that I'm still not sure I didn't mistakenly eat a display. 

Wish I could tell you about the July 4th Special made to order burritos, tacos and quesadillas but I can't. They didn't exist. Technically, the station was there with the special menu to drool over, and plenty of Latin side dishes that you wouldn't eat if you liked Latin food, but no cook. 

Honestly, I didn't try hard to hunt one down after previous \"help\" from the fabulous rio managers who I think are all praying they have some excuse to not come to work, but when they do, take it out on the customers. However, I did wait, more than once, even drawing temporary crowds of less patient poker players. Still, maybe that one's on me for not asking. 

Also my fault, thinking I could save time and money and treat the family to just the carnival side on checkout day. First, the hostess looked at me like I had 3 heads when I asked her about the $10 off offer on my Total Rewards App. I learned after we ate that I needed to ask for a coupon from the Rewards desk, but you think she would've known that. Anyway, it would've been cheaper and probably better if we just ate at Mandalay Bay on our way to the airport. 

Knowing we weren't missing anything on the seafood side didn't make up for the gray beef at the carving station. The teppanyaki was as bland as the previous night's shrimp. Really can't recall any good options from any of the other stations. 

Also got overcharged for my souvenir cup refills. Note: don't pay $12 for the same cup from the pool, they're cheaper inside, like everything else there. Asked my waitress for bottled water and was told it wasn't free. I said I was okay paying and was then told, \"the bar is closed.\" Seriously, I think that's the first time I've ever been told that in Vegas. She did drop off a tiny casino water at the end of dinner which was nice, but tasted like it someone else's bottle refilled with tap water.

If only dessert could've saved the day. Sadly, it didn't. 

Don't waste your money. Seriously, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, Coming to Las Vegas you would hope for a great buffet, The first thing is the staff was rude except for the bartender.  When you pay $50, you expect some class, this buffet reminded me of the Golden Coral. I would like to have someone making fresh sushi, cracking open your oysters, sautéing you seafood, the food was cold. I will say the Prime Rib was great, shrimp were okay, no seasoning on any cold steam food.  Finally the deserts were not good.  It a shame because we only went to one buffet hoping this was the best."}
{"text":"While researching for our trip to Vegas, I read that this seafood buffet was the best you'd ever have.  I'm not fond of buffets, but they're everywhere here so I figured why not try it.  There is a huge selection of food.  Everything I had was ok.  Nothing was more memorable than anything else.  The plus is that everything was fresh.  The servers cleared the table in a reasonable amount of time, and we didn't have to wait for our drink refills.  I'm glad I gave it a try after hearing so much about it.  Also, it's the only buffet I tried while here."}
{"text":"This buffet is extremely large and they have everything you could ever imagine a buffet to have.

It's a little pricey in my opinion... but I had to try it because my family told me it was amazing (they come to Vegas for vacation often, before I even moved here)! 

I didn't pay the extra $15 for entrance into the small seafood section. The food that I had access to included seafood, too... enough for me anyways. 

Some stuff was good, some stuff wasn't. It wasn't that busy when we were there so a lot of the food sat out too long because it wasn't being touched. They didn't have any special dishes or anything that stood out to me except for the noodle bowl section. I wish I could have tried it but I was so stuffed by the time I saw it. 

It was a fun experience and exciting to see the huge buffet but I would take my $$ and go to The M Resort and eat at the Studio B buffet instead next time."}
{"text":"This buffet is a good buffet. Not super expensive for a Vegas buffet. It is off the strip though, so if you're on the strip, you'll have to drive about .5 miles behind Caesar's palace. I went during the last 30min of lunch time (around 2:30) to pay for the lunch cost, but stay for the dinner items as well. I can tell dinner had more food options but not by much. Just some extra seafood options and the seafood buffet (which cost more and is part of dinner and you need a special wrist band). 

I enjoyed how they had foods from different cultures. They had an American, Hispanic, Asian, and other stations. Some of the food was not that great. Quality was ok. My favorite station was probably the Asian station. 

The ambiance was nothing special. Kinda just your typical buffet setting, even though it has the word \"Carnival\" in the name. 

The desserts were good. Decent selection of baked goods like cakes, pies, and cookies. The thing that stood out was that gelato bar. It wasn't amazing gelato, but it was still good especially being unlimited. 

Excited to try other buffets in Vegas next time!"}
{"text":"Pricey but I think, if you're going to go for buffet, then this is the one. Huge selection, you can't try it all."}
{"text":"Carnival World has stuffed me and my friends numerous times over the years. The buffet is hit or miss and has provided a mix of both with the majority hits. This visit unfortunately was a miss. The service was great but the food this time around was a big let down. Not all but the majority.

I'm not sure what was going on but most of the food was either bland or dry. I've come across dry food here and there within specific sections during previous visits but not across the board in all sections. That's not to say there wasn't some good items. Thankfully the verde pork I like here was ok and the chow mein. All else was a let down. Either that or I went for all the wrong items. 

On the upside, the dessert bar didn't fail. Good range of cakes and gelato. The lunch/brunch is very unpredictable. I've now come to realize all of my better experiences have been for dinner so I'll keep that in mind whenever another visit happens. Visiting tends to happen at random when a decision for dining hasn't been made between me and my friends. 

Lunch 3/18/2017"}
{"text":"No stars are deserved here. The food was bland, cold and lacking variety. Half of the signs telling you what something was, were wrong or missing. The seafood upgrade at an additional $20 per person was a waste! 80% of the seafood in this \"special\" area was available in the regular buffet. Dessert variety was lacking as well. Seating was disorganized and no one seemed to know what they were doing. Both the Men's and Women's restrooms had no paper towels to dry your hands and no blowers to dry your hands either. Definitely a disappointment and waste of $118 for my wife and I."}

I ended up getting a full refund"}
{"text":"Host was rude but our server was great. You have to pay a separate fee for the sea food buffet lame. The food was ok I wouldn't do rio buffet again."}
{"text":"Updated 6/16. Crystal, the manager, personally reached out for further details and an apology to share with staff and the executive chef. Very nice of her and great that she was genuinely concerned. Thank you Crystal. 

Ate there tonight 6/16 and it was one of the worst experiences. Food tasted bad, over cooked, over fried, and the best stuff from before that led me back here were no longer served - crispy roast pork and roast duck. Yes it was that good and amazingly served at this buffet. 

The worst part was having a rude and inattentive server. Lack of service through the hour we ate since he never came to check on us. He only carried away our used plates when we looked over at him or waived. But the worse part was the large black tray he left behind my head on top of a counter. I hit my head on it when leaning back. The tray had a dirty rag that was used to clean tables or silverware. There was also a stack of forks and knives left on the counter. This can't be hygienic. Given the recent news re legionnaires at this hotel, they should be more careful with keeping things clean. Another server was pushing a cart filled with dirty plates decided to stop next to my table to have a conversation with a female server. Pretty gross to see and smell dirty plates and food as you're eating. Never again."}
{"text":"We loved it! My girlfriends and I bought the bottomless drink package for $13.. It's the best deal in the Rio. The Buffet was great, and John the bartender made our night even better before we went to Chippendales. The crab legs were great, the desserts were delicious and the wine was perfect for the night. Thanks again John for the smile and the laughs."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent service. Brian was one of the best waiters I've had in all of Vegas! Most definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Mediocre buffet, 3.5 stars!
Tons of choices but the quality of the food isn't as delicate as caesar's buffet. If you do an upgrade, u get to go to the seafood area and eat oysters, etc. Since I don't eat seafood, I didn't do the upgrade. I like the \"live asian soup\" station of pho noodles. Very flavorful and way better than the pho outside in the Vietnamese restaurant in Rio!  The desserts were good but not wow. I wish they offered creme brûlée! They do have a gelato station but once again, it isn't wow. So I do feel the quality of the food can be better.. It isn't cheap! $47 for adults and $25 for kids dinner price. Kids under 3 are free. If you do the 24 hr buffet, then it cost $65 ($75 during the holidays) for adults and kids 4 and up!! Kids are the same price as adults- ridiculous! Upgrade for seafood is a separate cost. Also, they currently do offer breakfast 8-11 but when we inquired with a phone call to front desk, they were clueless and told us buffet opened at 11 so we missed breakfast!"}
{"text":"This buffet has really gone down, it's a shame. It use to be the best buffet in Vegas bar none. Had been coming here since 1993! But the last time I was there in March 2018, it was a shell of its former self. The staff and service is still top notch, but the food quality and selection has greatly diminished from its hay-day. Combined with the fact that there's no longer a free shuttle (or any shuttle) to and from the strip,  there's no need to go out of your way to eat at this buffet unless you're staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"For being rated as one of the top 10 buffets in Vegas, I was a little disappointed.  The carving station features prime rib and other meats, but for the $35 cost, this is basically a glorified Chinese buffet with a great dessert selection.  For an additional $20, you get the seafood buffet, which gets you 5 small lobster tails and all you care to eat crab legs.  Forget the $13 alcohol add-on (beer & wine), it's not worth it.  After eating, I only managed 2 glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 10+ years...This place has become a complete disappointment. Total Rewards chain of Buffets has completely downgraded their quality of food and service. Bought our 24hr buffet as usual, 1st surprise was at Carnival World Buffet at The RIO, they no longer have a stir fry station, the quality of food is a total downgrade, stations are reduced and food really sucks! Next day we headed out to Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood... Surprise again! No omelette station!!! REALLY???? That's the bare minimum standard for a brunch place!!! Mimosas are 1 per person! Oh boy, would have been nice if they told me this before I paid $75!!! YOU GUYS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES !!!
Stop trying to make an extra buck on your clients and at least be honest and upfront about your less than acceptable service. 
I for sure will NEVER COME BACK! People, please don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I remember back in the day when Rio had the best, most unique buffet around. The seafood buffet used to be in a separate restaurant back then. That was a while ago. 

We just went to the buffet and was surprised to find that it is all in one place now. Plus, when we got there at 12:30pm on a Saturday, there was hardly any line. That was kind of a sign there.

When we paid, my wife opted for the seafood buffet add-on for $20. Our bill was just short of $180 for four people (we had two kids). I would say that their concept of \"World\" buffet is still there: salad section, asian section, mexican section, prime meet slicing section, American section, etc. then the exclusive seafood section and finally the dessert island. But just about everyone does this now. So others have caught up and this one stayed the same. It was just very ordinary. Nothing I can really say was good about the food. My wife brought back some stuff in the seafood section but it was not much different than the World buffet section. We had some cold shrimp, crab legs, deep friend shrimp too. She had a few more things but it was definitely not worth the extra charge. My son and I got a nice slice of beef and pork chops. We asked the waiter for a steak knife and he said that they don't have any. We had to use the butter knives in our silverware set. What?

So I would say that this is a disappointing buffet and the others have simply past them. I would head out to the other new ones that are on the strip which are the same price. This one is considered overpriced to me. I would pass unless you just want something quick, but pricey."}
{"text":"The food here used to be very good when I last time came to Carnival World Buffet inside the Rio Casino in 2011.

Back then, there was more different types of food and taste good also. After they added the seafood, there were many different changes...

I visited the Carnibal World and Seafood Buffet on May 29, 2016 for dinner. Now when they added the seafood portion ($15 extra, around $50 for regular and seafood dinner together), there are less foods for regular price items and the food taste ok, not very flavorful. Since I am a local in Las Vegas, they only give you 25% off with ID for locals which is ok. Back then I always came here because of the 50% off offer. Even after the change, they cut back the salad and the toppings.

The only food that taste very GOOD is the DESSERT. They have many different types of cakes, ice cream (Gelato), desserts, and more. It seems that they put more effort in the dessert than the other food cuisines.

The service here is ALRIGHT. For the servers around the table, they are good because they respond very quick. As for the staff around the buffet station, they seem grumpy and not happy to work. 

I recommend if you want to try a new buffet and very HUNGRY, eat here. If you have gone here before try to avoid this buffet and eat something else because it's not worth the price."}
{"text":"What happened to this buffet???  It saddens me terribly to write this today.  Most of my childhood memories and excitement of Vegas involve trips here.  Even today all trips to Vegas include at least one stop at the Rio Carnival buffet.  But after this weekend I highly doubt I will continue that tradition.

We got here around 5:30pm this past Saturday to beat the crowds.  As expected there was no line and it was not crowded with many empty tables.  However it started off on the wrong foot when the hostess tried to seat our party of 8 by the restroom, away from the food.  After repeating my request two times to be seated closer, she agreed, albeit with unpleasant attitudes.

I haven't been here in five months and was surprised of the drastic changes that occurred since.  Beverages are now self-served but I can live with that.  However, what I can't tolerate are the fact that they no longer offer the different varieties of chicken skewers (mine and my daughter's favorites) and snow crab legs are now replaced with blue crab legs for the standard price of $34.99, unless you're willing to shell out an additional $20 (I don't think so!).  For that amount I'd rather eat at Caesar's Bachannal where the food and quality are way better.  

Today this place is overpriced.  The tastes and quality have gone downhill.  Everything tastes old.  We left at 7:30pm and the line wasn't as long as it was the same time a year ago.  They probably lost a lot of customers.

Goodbye Rio.  I am mourning this 20-year relationship.  But unless you can return to your glorious days, I am moving on."}
{"text":"This place use to be one of the best now it's just really expensive.  Now you have to pay for crab and the alcohol bracelet sucks.  The drink bracelet is all you can drink on one selection of beer, cheap wine and champagne in a tiny plastic cup.  Still ended up buying custom ordered drinks.  The deserts are great.  Our buffet with crab and alcohol and tip for 2 was about $250.
Bellagio or Cesar's is much much better."}
{"text":"All good things come to an end!  This buffet use to be the reason we built up our trips to Vegas.   We won't be back!   They decide to charge another $20 for seafood buffet creating a seafood deficit for the regular buffet.   The shrimp is extremely tasteless the crab legs are the smaller leftover parts from the seafood buffet expending more energy to dig for a speck of meat then it's worth!   Buffet soon to be slots!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Simply horrible. Paid $60 for seafood upgrade. Lobster was disgusting. Wish I could get those 60 minutes back. Forget the money, keep my money, horrible experience."}
{"text":"I liked the peking duck. I got a nice 'walker' quarter. The bbq ribs were like Mom used to make. Those were my personal highlights.

It is certainly one the largest buffets I have seen. I am not sure that size is a virtue however. Everything was good....well almost everything. I was intrigued by the noodle bar (pho, ramen, udon etc.) but they just didn't seem to be turning anything out....so I stopped waiting after about five minutes. The gelato selection was odd. Green tea was what I ended up with. Meh.

I had read in a previous review that the lobster bisque was inedible. I thought this was just some wannabe foodie trying to flame the place. I simply had to try it since lobster bisque is one of my favorite soups. It truly was inedible. I am laughing as I type this. It was 'the emperor is wearing no clothes' dreadful. You should go to the buffet just to see how bad it is!

The service was good. Everything was good. Nothing was spectacular. I ate at the Indian place the next night....much better."}
{"text":"we had the 24 hour buffet and added $25 each for the seafood buffet. you get 1 ticket for the lobster but there were so many selections for seafood that we didn't mind paying the added charge. the guy working the gelato section was so nice he always had a smile on his face and seemed genuinely happy serving everyone. my family only really ate seafood so I cant review the rest of the food...."}
{"text":"I love this buffet now that they fixed it. Seafood buffet used to be a different location but they combined them. You can choose to do the seafood upgrade which is great because I never want the upgrade. You get crab, sushi, fish, shrimp, and more without the upgrade anyway. The salad has fresh grilled steak and chicken available. Soup is great. Meats are good. This buffet was top 10 in the world but quality went down several years ago but thankfully they fixed it. They raised prices for awhile but locals and diamond get 50% off again (note there is no discount for Sunday brunch though). I'll be back often and will update if needed. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before going to see Penn and Teller at Rio. Nothing too impressive in our opinion. The seafood portion of the buffet is more expensive than the regular buffet, and they verified that you paid the upcharge for the seafood with a black light stamp on your wrist. If you go over to the regular buffet side though, they were serving crab legs which looked the same as the ones in the seafood section, and some shrimp. We paid a discounted cost for the buffet, due to going through \"Tix 4 Tonight,\" but I would have been pretty bummed if we paid full price for what they were offering. Pros: kid taking pictures of you when you walk in, with option to purchase later which was kind of nice. Service was great, server was friendly and quick to refill drinks."}
{"text":"I love how there were so many options to choose from, I mean it was a world buffet and we ate about half of what was available, mostly the seafood section. However, I came for the seafood and I thought the seafood was better at the Village Seafood Buffet when it was separate from the Carnival World Buffet. There were also more desserts and gelatos to choose from at the Village Seafood Buffet. Anyways, food was still good. I gave it a 4 star this time just because there weren't as many seafood and dessert options when it was just Village Seafood Buffet."}
{"text":"Robert P is an amazing waiter, the food was the best and the hosts were very welcoming. Thank you for an amazing lunch with the fam."}
{"text":"Disappointed in food and price seemed high  and didn't even include the seafood which is what I wanted ( but didn't want to pay extra for!). I had a better meal at Hometown Buffet the other night. I went there a few years ago and remember it so much better. 
The only plus was desserts were pretty delicious. 
I'll try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Am amazing buffet with over 1200 food items. The food is fresh with a international buffet yet it has all the Erica favorites. Our waitress Michelle was a true pleasure.  T house we is something foe everybody here."}
{"text":"I keep reading this was a good buffet, so I checked it out before the Penn and Teller show. It was not worth the money at all. The food was tasteless. I spent the extra for the seafood area of the buffet and noticed most of the seafood in the seafood area was also in the regular buffet. Do not pay extra for the seafood buffet if you go here. This is the first time I have ever left a dinner, let alone a buffet, not full. It was not good enough to eat much of. To top it off, my friend got sick into the bucket at the table. Don't waste your money. Spend it on a better dinner."}
{"text":"A good dinner with a tad disappointing thrown in is how I would describe the dinner we had here. We were here back in 2010 and we were blown away, so we were expecting it to be the same. We all found food that we liked and some of it was AMAZING but then some of it was just....eh. The service was great, and they did keep the buffet pretty full of hot food. The buffet has definitely shrunk since 2010, but there are still a lot of choices.  The desserts looked amazing and were gorgeous but they were seriously lacking taste and flavor....like they forgot that desserts are supposed to have sugar. My oldest son loves gelato and was very happy with it.  If the price had been even $20 each, I think I would have been much happier,  but at nearly $35 each....it just didn't measure up. We definitely won't be back to this buffet."}
{"text":"I was just here only to Eddie Griffin on Monday December 18th. I purchased the Groupon for for non seafood with unlimited wine and beer. The best part about the buffet was the wine, didn't have any beer that night. Oh and they had tamales. Otherwise this was like an old country/hometown buffet smh. Being my fist time and perusing the food, there was what felt like a cop that jumped right in front of me with a flashlight. Unbeknownst to me that was the seafood side which she didn't hesitate to tell me rudely smh. Never Again will I waste my money. The Groupon was 136.00."}
{"text":"First time here and last time here. Went out of my way to get a rewards card as well, and I'm glad I did because I would of been pissed off to pay full price here. I don't recommend it to anyone..old sitting out food, great staff but the food is shit."}
{"text":"This buffet was the best in Las Vegas definitely work the money in my opinion it's a Lil pricey but it's well worth it. Only complaint was the chick bartender with the bad attitude working the brunch hours on a Sunday. She had attitude with me and 2 other people waiting for drinks. Other then that everything was good food is good, they have a lot to choose from, clean"}
{"text":"This buffet has a wide range of foods that are presented well, however if you have ever gone on a Royal Caribbean cruise and eaten at the Windjammer, you will be disappointed here.  The carved meats were excellent.  Don't bother having the seafood unless you do the upgrade bc the crab legs are tiny and not worth the work and you can tell everything is thawed out of a box.  The salads are good and so are the Asian choices, but the pasta is mushy, bland, and over cooked.  The desserts look amazing but they all really taste the same.  They aren't very sweet so don't expect that.  The bread pudding was the best tasting thing going. The pies look like they're from a grocery store and don't taste as good.  You pay for quantity here-  not quality.  It's clean, well laid out, not crowded though the line to get in took a while.  We ate at the Indian, Chinese, Hash A Go Go, and American grill restaurants in the Rio and the food, while just as expensive as the buffet, was OUTSTANDING.  You really can't go wrong with any of the other restaurants in the hotel.  But steer clear of the buffet.  It's not worth it unless you're a power eater."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place two years ago and I have a huge change. For the past few years I've been trying out places for crab legs (my fav). Two years ago this buffet was at the top. Offers a nice variety, quality was great, price was reasonable. It's about $35 per person for buffet unless you want the \"extra seafood\" the it's an additional $15-$20. You get about 30 more options of seafood ex: sushi, seafood dishes in sauces or fried, oysters (cold). They had the good snow crab leg back in 2015 I've been back twice and they switched it out for the really thin plastic crab legs. Less meat not appetizing. I've tried other places. Rhythm Kitchen on Decatur has AYCE snow crab legs on Tuesday nights for $42/person. That's my new favorite. This buffet has gone down on quality and is just another \"meh\" place as far as buffets go. For $50 I'd rather go somewhere else"}
{"text":"At one time this buffet was one of the best in Vegas.  I have eaten here countless times.  This is no longer the case.

We had dinner here last night as part of the Buffet of Buffets pass.  The tepanyaki station is no longer there.  The crab legs were nothing to talk about.  The roast beef was overcooked and dry.  It is basically overpriced cafeteria food.  The desserts were ok - gelato was good, creme brulee was good and thr bananas foster was good.

So disappointing that this has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Typical buffet in Vegas. Quality sucks and nothing is ever fresh. Also for the seafood selections, you have to pay extra. You can either choose to get 5 tiny lobster tails or one whole lobster. 

Nothing really much to say. Wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Came here with my family. We paid $190 for 5 of us. Yikes! The food was pretty good though. Big variety. The Asian food was great. The fried rice and spring rolls were good. The highlight for our family was the American food. The made to order hamburgers and hot dogs were actually pretty delicious. My kids ate a ton of pizza, shrimp and chicken wings. The only negatives are; although they look delicious, the desserts were pretty bland. Even the gelato was subpar. There were no toppings for the hotdogs; relish, onions, mustard...etc. 
In general we all left with full bellies and enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Departed with a slight dissatisfaction for a once great establishment.

Visited here during a week night and the seafood selection is no longer on par with other buffets in Vegas. Vats and trays of dishes sitting around for far too long and flavors becoming bland after cooking under heat lamps and under boilers.

The Rio really needs to re-evaluate and see what others are doing in Vegas to stay relevant."}
{"text":"From the outside this may appear to be the Rolls Royce of buffets, but from the inside this place is pitiful. Maybe they get their week old food / leftovers from all the other hotels.
 In fact, it was so bad that the next day i took our group to the Paris Buffet and charged it. I'm not going to make the same mistake twice of eating at this overpriced Rio buffet. And maybe they are all probably from the same Caesar Corporation, but Paris was more enjoyable and food was way better.

Back to the Rio Buffet...
There's not a lot of people here at the Rio Buffet, yet it took awhile to put three tables together for our group. In fact they brought several people waiting in line ahead of our group. 
So what's so special about their buffet.  Well their is nothing that stands out except for the price...around $30.00.   Then if you are crazy enough to spend an additional  $20.00 on seafood which didn't look good.  Same fish food items on the other side.  The ice cream cone was the highlight of the buffet. 

But while I was going to check out the seafood side of the buffet, I stepped on something on the floor and went flying on the floor and injured my legs.  I bumped into the counter and there was a bump on my head. 
So, I went back to my table and was dizzy a little. So the girl asked for security and then the buffet manager came over and had me sit down in a chair next to a railing out of view from other patrons.  My group eventually found where I was at.

But it was what this buffet manager said and did afterwards that has me puzzled and upset.
He was really weird.
As I was waiting for security, this buffet manager with his arms folded and less than six feet away kept intensely staring at me, smiling and almost laughing for almost several minutes. 
 I  then asked him why are you staring at me and smiling.   He said that he was waiting for security. 
As security and a Rio hotel EMT arrived and were checking me, they asked me questions about what happened and to fill out the report. 
When I started to respond, this manager began interrupting and began saying that he didn't see anything on the floor.  
I then asked that manager if he would like to fill out my report with his version since he wasn't there.   I then asked them to check out the cameras. The security] person told me not to pay attention to him.  
Thank goodness that the employees told me asparagus was on the floor.  And thank goodness some people from my group heard his comments. 
This manager is incompetent and very uncompassionate and should not be in the position he holds.
As for the report, it did not look genuine.   Just a piece of paper with no heading.   It probably ended up in the trash can, because I didn't hear anything mentioned about this from management. 

Watch where you step in this place and don't expect any compassion from that Buffet manager or management.   At least the employees were asking how I was."}
{"text":"To sum it up in short.... mehhh. Their is a large section for boiled seafood you can add on to your buffet experience but that was probably the only upside to the buffet. All of the dishes are very mediocre and are about the same quality as what you will find in the station casinos scattered throughout the LV valley. In my humble opinion, save your scratch and just hit up a decent resturant instead of over paying for overeating marginal plates of food."}
{"text":"Booth that we were seated in was coming apart and my daughter cut her leg on the staples that were protruding from it. 
And the food wasn't good either. 
Overall a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Love the buffet here! Lots of choices and a great bar but the best bartender there is john!"}
{"text":"I dinner buffet a lot in Las Vegas. I think here is a good 1 for us too. They're have everything for foods and also very nice and fresh seafood too. But special for me is dessert. 

When you check-in here you gonna got nice special dessert to go 1Free that cool."}
{"text":"Wow! This truly how I felt after eating here. I had a deal as I have the players card and wanted to try the seafood buffet. This is more expensive than just the carnival world side and not really necessary as they have some seafood on the other side. 

This is the largest buffet I have ever seen and the food is incredible. There are choices from all over the world and the dessert section is amazing. The chef's here really know what foodies are looking for.

The service is also impressive and our waiter 
 Was personable and really funny.

I would say to check it out mid week as it is cheaper and so worth it."}
{"text":"I have always heard how great this buffet was and finally decided to try it out and found out how unbelievably unimpressive it was.  I took my family to dinner, which there was nine of us and expected a little longer wait time to be seated, but 20 minutes from the time we paid is a little bit much.  We all got the Seafood upgrade, which most of the seafood we took tasted or smell bad. It also gave half of us food poisoning that night!  I feel that it was not a good meal for the price.  Also the restaurant temperature was quite hot.  At first I thought it was just me, but most of my family felt the same way.  It has to say something when you leave the casino and go outside and you feel comfortable, it might be a little too warm.  I decided to write a comment card and was pretty much laughed at and said we will look into it to pacify me.  I then decided to then complain to customer service and was told by several different people talk to someone else, and I was finally passed to a hotel manager. She told me that she would take my name and number down and someone would call me to hear my complaint.  That was three days ago and I still have yet to receive that phone call.  I would say if they way the casino staff dealt with complaints is any indication of how they run their business, I would definitely steer clear of the Rio!"}
{"text":"Eek - this is worst buffet I've been to in Las Vegas. And it's expensive!! 

I came here on two separate nights while I was staying at the Rio for business. I was seeking a quick meal both evenings. I usually like buffets: you don't have to wait for food, you don't have to deal much with servers, and there's plenty of variety.  

All those things hold true here. There was never a wait in the queue for a table. I was seated immediately and even without the seafood add-on, there was plenty of variety. (And by the way - there was plenty of seafood dishes in the non-seafood areas). There was nothing unique or special offered; it was basically a compilation of everything I've ever seen at a buffet at a wedding. 

Unfortunately, the food was just so bad. All of the food was laid out on huge serving trays, and many of the dishes did not look freshly prepared. In fact, on many trays the food was either crusting over, or cheese that clearly had not been re-melted from the warming lamps yet, or vegetables that looked limp and lifeless. I found food to fill me up, but it was mostly simple items that are fine re-heated (like pizza, rice, etc) or items that were deep-fried. Even the dessert area, which is usually the glimmer of light even in a terrible buffet, wasn't that great. The gelato flavors I tried just weren't that good. 

The second evening, I tried to go to some of the other restaurants in Rio, but they all had lines of people waiting for tables, so I reluctantly headed back to the buffet. It was slightly better the second night, with some of the food looking a little fresher, but overall the same as the previous night. 

The best part of both meals was the service. They cleared my plates quickly, and provided refills on drinks without asking. 

I'd recommend going here if you need a quick bite, you don't care about the quality of the food, and you're not paying. Otherwise, there are so many better places to eat, and specifically better buffets to try, than this one."}
{"text":"For what once a trendsetter among Vegas buffets, this is now the most disappointing and overpriced AYCE dining experience in town! Meat carving station had NY strip cooked to well done and completely dried out/inedible, roast beef tough and chewy; couldn't even provide fresh turkey on the day before Thanksgiving! Most dishes lukewarm temps at best even if freshly placed out for consumption (Mama's lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo, pork ribs). Desserts were nicely done and presented but not a single choice of cake of any kind or flavor other than cheesecake. STAY AWAY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"$42 on a Saturday night for food farther (or is it further?! I don't know!) than the eye could see, including crab legs? Not bad for Vegas.

You can't beat the size and variety of this buffet. Everything I tried was tasty, but I'd ruined my stomach the night before by turning 25 and combining it with my best friend's bachelorette party. Anyway, I liked what I saw. This buffet was my favorite as a kid, and I was glad to see it was still wow-ing me!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing selections. Everything was very good hats off to the cooks. High priced but you get what u pay for"}
{"text":"I have been to carnival multiple times in the past because the variety was great and the quality was awesome.  But this last time I went you could tell it has went downhill quite a bit.  Definitely overpriced for the quality you get.  I could get better quality and better variety at a smaller buffet for half the price.  Avoid at all cost.  The only way to get your value is if you drink something like 20 mimosas.  Mimosas come with the price of the buffet"}
{"text":"WOW!  Divided up by region of the world is such a good idea.  Very well organized, clean, appealing, and worth the price.  Great place for seafood lovers.  Desserts were decent also."}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE. GO TO PARIS LE BUFFET OR THE WYNN BUFFET INSTEAD. I used to love this place. Now they raised the prices, and limit you to 5 measly halves of little rock lobster. Really? For $57+ weekday, that's all you get? The Jonah crab claws were bland, and the cheap snow crab legs were also tasteless with a few ones that were really salty. No service from the waiter. Now you serve yourself the drinks, and the guy did not even come to get dishes piled up. Useless fellow. SO it is the end of a Vegas era for me. Until the reviews change for the better, I will not go back to the Rio buffet."}
{"text":"The line snakes round and round the guide-rails and reminds me of people waiting to get on a popular rollercoaster or cattle moving through a pen. The large dessert station is located front and center.  Why are the desserts on display for hungry people waiting to get in?  The kid behind me is eyeing my forearm like its a fresh baked drumstick.  Hurry this process up because I lose a limb. 

Expensive for a buffet and while it's still one of the better midrange buffets, its not really worth the high price of admission. It has all the typical food stations and a nice selection of meats.  The setting is comfortable and you don't feel like you're in a room with hundreds of other diners even though you are.  

The staff is courteous and attentive but nowadays they don't have to do much for you except remove plates as you clear them off.  The drinks you get and refill yourself. 

Located at the far left side of the casino when facing from the front."}
{"text":"This is a tough review. The food and the staff were good, but the price and selection was not quite there. I opted for the seafood part of the buffet which is an extra $15 on top of the already $35 price. While having the seafood option was nice, they kind of scrimped on the products they had out. The crab legs were your standard, small, snow crab legs. There were bigger ones, but they were on the cold section and unsteamed. Also, they had bits of lobster cut up into smaller pieces (not whole tails) but usually people were in a makeshift line for that and most good pieces were snatched up quickly. They seemed to be only re-filing that every so often.
If i ever went back, it would probably only be if i had some kind of coupon or reassurance that the seafood selection would be slightly better. For $50, off strip, i expected a little more. All in all though, i did enjoy the buffet. The prime rib was very good and most of the other things i had were pretty good as well."}
{"text":"The Food Was very Delicious. The staff here was friendly. I would definitely come back here to visit. Erika Roman was a great host"}
{"text":"5 stars for our server Robert! Very friendly & attentive. The omelet & pancake stations were great. Request Robert for the best service!!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop at the rio seafood buffet before checking in nearby this weekend

After passing by the Chippendales on my way down the escalator my heart (stomach) sank when I noticed that they were...
Remodeling the seafood section again?

Paid the $50 instead of $30 for the inconspicuous seafood line stamp (small section to the right that was zoned off for those that could only enter with this stamp that would only be visible under the special lamp)

Huge downgrade on the \"usual\" seafood that I have been accustomed to seeing.

Will return only when the remodel is done for the higher quality seafood IMO

Also, had a chance to use the WAZE navigation application to and from Vegas that was fascinating to this old geezer"}
{"text":"Wow this has gone down hill since they moved the location to colocate.  I should have known something was up when there was no line...the seafood part looked like everything had been left out since yesterday...i am afraid the oysters are going to make me sick tonight.  The sashimi looked old.  The poki wasnt that great.. the boiled shrimp was ok.  Walked over the world buffet and it wasnt any better over at that part either.  I cant believe  this buffet is only $5 cheaper than bacchanal at ceasar's.  Skip this and go to Ceasars"}
{"text":"We visit Las Vegas often and frequent the Buffets. We always loved the Carnival World Buffet, but on a visit in February we had some issues. We got in touch with The Food and Beverage Manager, talked out my problem and even got to meet him on our last visit. They made lots of changes and the food and choices are better than ever. I highly recommend. this Buffet"}
{"text":"$40 per person. Pretty high if you ask me, especially for the quality of the food..it's nothing special, but hey, that's vegas!... I was starving so I didn't care at the time. It's good if you're starving but I wouldn't really go here again"}
{"text":"We came here for 4th of July weekend. No no no.. Never again. This buffet is way too expensive for the shitty food served :/ (price was even more expensive because it was a holiday weekend) 

Our group was a total of 4 people and only 3 of us paid extra for the seafood section, I don't know why we did that, it was not worth it. 
It is a small section in where they have one staff standing outside making sure you have your hand stamped before allowing you in that section. Well, let me give you a tip, only pay 1-2 upgrade and have them go to that seafood section and get food. They don't come to your table to check those who have not paid cannot eat that. 

Too expensive but I will give them 1 star because staffs are nice."}
{"text":"So I've been here before in the past and recall this buffet being somewhat OK, but my recent visit was very disappointing.  After my recent trip to Vegas, I would actually recommend avoiding the Rio all together, but I'll stay on topic though and talk about the buffet.

The food in general was all very mediocre-bad and nothing stood out (other than how dry the fish fillets were).  The price is a bit expensive ($30-$35 + $20 for seafood area upgrade), which is expected for Vegas, but the quality you expect was definitely not there.  I went in right as the dinner began at 4pm, so everything should be fresh and hot...  several of the items I tried were just straight out cold and flavorless, while others I had wanted to try had never been put out or refilled (shrimp dumplings).  The tiny offering of sushi looked and tasted like expired super market sushi.  The special $20 upgrade sea food section has a guard on duty to protect all the B grade sea food, which I'm glad I didn't pay for.  I actually felt bad about all the uneaten food I kept leaving on my plates as I tried to find something edible, but I digress... The one good thing about this buffet would be the dessert section right in front.  Desserts are probably the easiest things to get right in the culinary world, but even this dessert bar pales in comparison to other buffets on the strip.


All in all, this buffet is a waste of your time and money.  You can easily get a very high quality meal at many restaurants in Vegas for the $30-$60 you'll spend here.  They don't even have drink service at this buffet anymore, so you have to constantly go get your own refills as well.  Anyway, I could on for days about how bad the seating is and the the commemorative picture trap they have set, but If you want a truly excellent buffet experience though, then head over to Caesars Palace, Aria, or Cosmopolitan.  You'll spend around the same money and have a truly gourmet buffet at your disposal."}
{"text":"This place used to be the PREMIER buffet of Las Vegas but fast forward to now and I don't know how it's still open.

I was Vegas for a mid week trip and was told by the front desk that my stay included two free lunch passes for their buffet. Well I never complain about FREE FOOD however it turns out that the buffet wasn't even open for lunch service. Turns out that they switch up their hours recently and were no longer doing lunch weekday service. After calling the front desk, they said that they would still let me use my free passes at dinner time!

I came here for dinner and the seafood buffet (which used to be a separate buffet on it's own) is an additional upgrade. Even though the buffet was free, I wasn't very impressed and quite let down. My old favorite station used to be the one with fried fish and chips, shrimp, calamari, hush puppies...those deep fried goodies were basically reduced to nothing. The carving station wasn't that great and overall quality of the food is just very low and poor.

Unless you are a Diamond/7 Stars rated player, drinks are also self serve. I only note that because most Vegas buffets still serve you beverages. 

Random note but while waiting in line, they had a photographer ask to take my photo in front of a Rio backdrop. I declined but it's like BRO I'M NOT AT A NIGHTCLUB, I'M ABOUT TO STUFF MY FACE lol

I wouldn't come back, even if I had free passes. Just so many more eats available on and off the Strip. 

Final Piece of Dirty Donovan Advice? Thanks for the childhood memories! I remember one time eating so many cheeseburgers and fries here, my mom yelled at me :)"}
{"text":"Incredible service, amazing selection, fresh and delicious food! The servers were attentive and helpful but not constantly bugging you. Definitely worth the price! Family friendly atmosphere, dinner for two,or dinner for 10 its got a very nice atmosphere to fit any occasion! Everything is very clean and staff members are very attentive to keep the highest standards of cleanliness, guests needs, and providing only fresh entrees. My absolute favorite entree is the vietnamese pho! The best dessert for me Was the cookies and cream gelato with butterfinger and caramelized bananas, absolutely perfect together!! Would have 5 stars if they did a military discount. Definitely have to return every time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Amazing buffet! My favorite one to eat at!!! They have so much food VARIETY ASK AROUND! I've been too many viewers and this one is the best! They have everything! Mexican, seafood, sushi, salads YOU NAME IT! 

Only thing that isn't great is the wait time to pay they do take LONG but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This review is for the seafood buffet. I have been coming to this buffet for years, however tonight was the last time I will be dining here. The quality has gone down tremendously. Firstly, last year they combined the location of the seafood buffet with the regular Carnival World buffet. That was the first indicator that quality was likely to suffer. The seafood selection became fewer when that happened but the price remained the same. I went again this evening with my wife only to find out that the price has increased and they now give you a voucher for one serving of lobster (where it used to be all you can eat). Diners must choose between five small lobster tails or one small-sized whole lobster...and that is your limit. The only reason you would dine at this buffet is for the unlimited lobster. Given that this feature is now taken away, the price has been significantly increased, and the overall quality of the food has drastically diminished, I would strongly recommend that prospective diners Do Not choose this restaurant. There are plenty of better alternatives."}
{"text":"We have been huge fans of the Rio Seafood Buffet for many years. We would go there twice each Vegas stay. This year was our first trying it now that they moved to the Carnival World location and made it an up charge. We were totally disappointed. We arrived right after opening at 3:00 pm on Sunday. The Seafood was cold (those items that were supposed to be hot). The selection was extremely limited. It was a far cry from what they used to have. We will no longer be going back. It was just not worth it. They took a great place and ruined it."}
{"text":"Wait time was was decent, not too long. Not as big as I imagined but a decent selection of food. Seafood was good and worth the price. As far as the other food I would give it 1 star."}
{"text":"My family and I came to eat at the seafood buffet yesterday. My mom had came to this place a few years ago but when we arrived yesterday, she was surprised that they had split the buffet into two. One was the Carnival World Buffet and the other was the Seafood Buffet. It's about a $15 difference and with the Seafood Buffet, you are allowed to eat at both buffets. You will receive a stamp after paying to let you into the seafood buffet. 

So, we had came here because my mom RAVED about how good the food was and how much she loved the lobsters. Sadly, the lobster was not as fresh (and not to mention as big) as she had it before. Things have definitely changed in three years. The food was alright too. Nothing too special. Of course, the variety was there but the taste and quality wise, it was alright. There wasn't a lot of dessert variety either. Just some pies, cookies, and cheesecake. The gelato was definitely the cherry on top to my whole meal. 

I would give this a 1 star but the waiters who served us were very kind and for that, I give this buffet an extra star. 

Overall, don't spend your $48 on the seafood buffet. Just stick with eating at the Carnival World Buffet or somewhere else."}
{"text":"Expensive garbage! Should of eaten out of the dumpster at Denny's!! This use to be a good place to eat, one star is one too many!"}
{"text":"The fall of a once fabulous buffet, have not been here in years the rio and the buffet seem like they have fallen on hard times hotel it self fell a little but the once grand rio buffet has to be the laughing stock of all the other buffets or genius for what they charge for a scaled down Denny's of the buffet world.
33 bucks for really old dry lousy food or a 20 upgrade gets too a hand stamp and entrance to  a poorly stocked seafood section it's crazy your better off at hash house and that place sucks 
Your best bet is to avoid this place food bad service worse and everyone's unhappy
The place including hotel looks likes its fallen on hard times. What's going on Vegas your grand old lady's are fading away to late for the rio buffet it died and no one cares"}
{"text":"Omg....the WORST buffet I have ever eaten.
And NO lobster or crab..which is what they advertise at front. Will NEVER eat here again!"}
{"text":"I like this buffet and enjoy coming here on my visits. It's pricey, but I like it. People complain about the person who wants to take your picture when you walk in, and it is annoying. BUT, you don't have to do it, just say \"No thanks\" when you walk in. One reviewer says that they take a picture of you and charge you for it.... not true. If you let them take your picture, then they will find you a later and ask you if you want to buy a print. It's annoying, but you don't have to do it. This is Vegas, it's what they do. 

The food has always been pretty solid here and I think it's still the biggest buffet in town. A new feature is the self serve fountain drink machines. They are super fancy with a video touch screen that lets you select your drink. I enjoy the prime rib / ham / turkey station, very tasty. The have a good seafood section (not the seafood buffet that is extra) with crab and shrimp. They have a wide selection, including pizza, salads and Asian food. There is a large dessert section in the middle of the buffet that is great.

Sometimes you run across some things that aren't the best, but that's the way it is at any buffet. I haven't tired the seafood buffet that costs extra so I can't comment on that part."}
{"text":"There is so much on the menu, but you'll find pretty much anything else that walks, swims or flies, cooked up in more ways than one. I am usually not a fan of buffets but I was talked into trying out the buffet by one of the staff members named John Roberson.

The possibilities are endless. Including delectable and innovative matrimonies such as chicken and lobster.
The menu is relatively large, so choosing can be tough, and be prepared to spend as if you're on vacation. 

I highly recommend trying out this buffet."}
{"text":"SO MUCH BETTER when the two buffets were separate!!! It was A-OK in the food selections, however, we did not do the upgrade for the seafood side. Though they had an attendant standing at the entrance of the VIP seafood area with a blacklight and all, I peeped over the partition to see the offerings. There were a few that sounded interesting, but it did not appear to be enough to charge an extra $20. On the \"regular\" side, the selections were decent. Nothing particularly jumped out, but the make your own pho was pretty good, and the chilled crab legs, though I prefer mine warm. The service was sub par. The hostess was rude, and our server/busgirl was nice, but you could tell she was exhausted from the day. Oh, and they strangely turned ON the music as they were closing. LOL. All in all, mediocre."}
{"text":"Generic food and overpriced. Only went there because we had food credit through the Rio. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype...we ate at the buffets at harrahs, paris, and rio on our last stay and I gotta say rios was the worst.  I think we were expecting Brazilian food...rio...not the case.  I filled my plate once and that was tough...finished that and then left.  Luckily we bought the all day pass so we took the bus to harrahs and finished eating there.

Do not Do not Do not pay 30 dollars to eat here.  You will be pissed off."}
{"text":"This buffet has seriously declined in quality. You have to pay $20 extra for things such as shrimp cocktail, crabs legs and other seafood items you get at any other buffet for the regular price. The upcharge also includes ONE lobster or FIVE small tails, which were all you can eat previously. The layout is terrible, you have to long walks back and forth from your seat in you are not in the middle. Other food is only so-so. Dessert may be the best of all the items."}
{"text":"So the Rio use to really bring it. Then about 4 months ago every time we went they weren't making the muscles they were out of crab. All of a sudden you get your own drinks and theres only 4 servers, witch is fine but I that case why should I tip a server that just only seats me.  We haven't been back since so if your going g here make sure that they have what you want first, cuz apparently just cuz they advertise it they don't have to put it out"}
{"text":"For a 35$ buffet, this place is incredibly \"meh.\" True to its name, the buffet offers a wide variety of ethnic cuisines... that you could probably find at a carnival. The Chinese food section was incredibly mediocre. The dim sum felt cheap and they literally serve orange chicken that I can honestly say is far worse than Panda Express. The made-to-order noodles literally reminds me of instant noodles and the soups are very cheaply made... .( seriously egg drop soup???) 

The Japanese cuisine was also a let down. They offer different sushi such as California roll.... and variations of California rolls. 

The pasta and pizzas were good. Nothing more, nothing less. They taste as if you went to the store and bought some sauce, then poured it over pasta. Throw in some veggies, some meats and boom you have the World buffet pasta. 

The carving station and the fresh crab meat/ shrimp were honestly the only selling point. (In terms of the main meal as I did think the deserts were decent and interesting) Honestly, I felt as if they just threw in a bunch of fresh crab meat and used that to jack up the prices. Besides that, I felt everything else was just filler food that is not only cheap, but also.... noticeably cheap. 

I didn't try the seafood section as that would've added 20 dollars on each person. Maybe its amazing, but for the 35 dollars, I felt sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Robert was our server this morning in our Diamond section. He was great- very tentative and even replaced my daughters soda when it didn't taste right. He also recommended the strawberry pancakes and they were delicious!!"}
{"text":"I mean... There is a lot of food. I mean, probably the largest buffet I've been to. But the food was average. Probably wouldn't go back. $49.95"}
{"text":"**This review is NOT for the seafood buffet**

This is actually one of my favorite buffets compared to some high end/fancy buffets in Vegas. They have endless options from Seafood, BBQ, Asian, Mexican, Italian, American, Dessert Station, Salad Bar, etc. It's seriously a far walk to get from 1 end to another, which is perfect to burn off some calories while you're there! Haha

For dinner, they have crab legs & prime rib, and they're both pretty legit!

I'm bummed that they don't have the 50% off for locals anymore as that was a steal. It was also perfect for when my family would have guests visiting Vegas & they'd want to experience a \"Vegas Buffet\".

Nonetheless, I still dine here occasionally during my cheat days =P"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for 10+ years and this was our favorite buffet to come to. We came to this buffet today and this will be the last time we ever come back. We are so angry and disappointed at what this buffet has become. It is not worth paying for anymore... I would not recommend this buffet at all"}
{"text":"Great food and great options to choose from. Last day for crab legs was 5/10/18!!!!! Not sure if they will bring them back and this tome they are not sure! Nice staff, clean plates and silverware.
Looking forward to returning when back in LV!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! $34 but Nothing good to eat and not much selection available. The food were so salty especially the crab legs. Don't waste your $! Zero star!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would give 0 stars to the bar tender John.  The buffet includes mimosas.  When I was at the bar, my boyfriend approached me and asked for a pineapple mimosa and walked away.  The bartender heard him and said \"TELL HIM TO GET HIS ASS OVER HERE AND BRING SOME MONEY\" while spinning his Tip jar when my boyfriend walked away.  John then started helping the next person behind me completely ignoring my boyfriends order.  He was serious about not helping me until he brought money.  The buffet price includes mimosas and I don't have a problem tipping waiters, waitresses, or bar tenders, but I was definitely shocked by that comment.  We were recommended by many people to the Rio buffet and were enjoying the food until that happened.  After that we didn't even eat or enjoy anything.  John ruined our whole experience at Rio.  If the mimosas had an extra charge we would have gladly payed it.  John later said he was playing with me, but that comment even playing around is completely rude.  He made it seem as if we were some broke,  freeloading people when in reality the price of the buffet includes mimosas. The food was good, but after that we weren't able to enjoy anything.  No complaints about our waiter, manager, or food. It was unfortunate that he ruined our whole experience at the carnival buffet in Rio."}
{"text":"Not that great. The seafood part is one little section off to the side. The rest of the buffet has many stations and a variety of food ranging from Chinese to Mexican to Italian. The food was average. The desserts were tasty though and service was good but overall the buffet is overpriced and not worth it."}
{"text":"I was here many years ago. It was excellent then. I talked it up to my husband so we went. It went downhill. Quality of seafood was sub par for the extra $20. Having the lobster with all the poop veins was nauseous.   They did have some cut in half but not clear when you go up and order. And you only get one but used to be all you can eat lobster. Used to have 5 times the seafood meals. I would not pay the $55 for this."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"pretty good, but doesn't warrant the cost\".  There were some tasty dishes, but for the cost they fell short.  The lobster was good but TE crab was overcooked.  The sashimi was tasty and fresh but the shrimp polenta was too spicy.  The rest of the buffet was, again, pretty good but not excellent.  If you want to spend big dollars on a high-end buffet you'd be better served at other Vegas properties."}
{"text":"Maybe I just came at a bad time, but it taste like Golden Corral food. It's a big variety, but lacks in quality. $70 for two is too much for this, find another buffet if you want a great experience."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome. Primarily the seafood buffet. Now that they've combined the seafood buffet with the regular buffet (for $20 extra you get a glowing crab stamp), it's really gone downhill. A quarter of the seafood choices. The full Lobster was very over cooked, dry and just not good at all. The Lobster tails were good. The shrimp scampi was good. Not worth $20 extra. Save your money and just do the normal buffet."}
{"text":"Carnival World was a Buffet on the west side of the Rio hotel that always  had a 2 hours wait for a table.  The food was spectacular in variety and quality from opening to closing. The Casino floor you watched inline was a mass of people. You were in a location full of energy and the robusk atmosphere of this Hotel & Casino was infectious.  

On the East side of the Hotel a Seafood Buffet that also had many anxious dinners.  These seafood buffet dinners were always playing the slots or consuming reasonable priced beverages @ an amazing round bar in front of the Rio's Seafood Buffet.   The din from the multitude of slot machines music jingles was exciting. The delight of the exciting Mardi Gras Parade that circled in that section of the hotel added to your forthcoming culinary delights.     

How times have changed, Carnival World is a shadow of its former Buffett, and the seafood buffet closed and unfortunately became an $20 upgrade scam to the horrid downgraded Carnival World Buffet.

If you live in a section of the world that does not offer an average buffet, then you might enjoy what the Rio still offers under the guise of the  Carnival World & Seafood Buffet.  During Holidays, popular trade Conventions, or weekend that are over booked in Vegas, maybe this buffet is acceptable fare, because everywhere else has longer wait times."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because the last time I was here was 10 years ago. Off the back as I enter and pay my fees for me, my father,son and friend the cashier ask if I wanted to leave a tip? I'm thinking to myself\"wtf, tips are base on services that you received while eating\". Anyhow, I paid for the extra seafood for all hoping it'll be worth it. So the cashier gave me coupons for the lobster and said \"take this to the seafood section and give the coupons to the chef in back to receive your choice of 5 lobster tails, or a whole lobster\"so I go and hand them the coupon for my choice. I was planning on choosing the lobster tail but to my surprise is that they were giving 5 pieces of HALF a lobster tail... wtf!?!?!? I wasn't told HALF, and the size of the \"whole\"lobster they were talking a out are basically a little but bigger than my palm.talk about being deceived. On top of the service!?!?!? I asked for a utensil  to break the crab leg shell and the busperson or waiter gave 1 utensil and said that it was 1 per table(really, for all 4 people eating and we have to share it?). That was the 1st that I saw the bus person that was suppose to service my table, the next time I saw him was when I had a lot of plates on my tables to the point that I had to stack them up on the empty table next to us(which means that he never bother to look or come by our table). So in the end, my experience at the carnival seafood buffet was pleasing at all. I would NOT recommend this place to any of my friends( but i would recommend going to the Bellagio seafood buffet, it's 2x better and the service is FANTASTIC and it's price is a lot cheaper)."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a walk to get to Rio from the main strip, we ended up ubering back to the strip after dinner because we didn't want to make the long trek back, but it was well worth the trip. 

This was one of the best buffet's I've ever been to. The number of choices was very overwhelming at first, they have a lot of different stations (italian, sushi, chinese, seafood, comfort food, meat carving station, etc). My favorite thing was the orange chicken, their entire Asian section was amazing. The desserts were all delicious and in small portions, which was nice because my friend and I wanted to try so many and we could easily split a lot without eating so much that we felt overstuffed. 

The only thing I didn't like were how large portions were if you got meat from the carving station. Both my friend and I asked for small pieces of meat so we wouldn't waste and they gave us huge cuts."}
{"text":"The worst buffer I ever had ...we paid $50 for seafood buffet!!!oyster not fresh....crab leg still frozen...bad quality !!!plz not spend your money here!!go eat McDonald's !!!!!"}
{"text":"If you don't want to give your money away do not come here, me and my spouse came here thinking it was going to be great by all the hype they put out there.... Some of the food is very dry and there is nothing great about the sea food I've had better at way much cheaper buffets in California, the food was very bland!!! It was $108 for two people!!!! On a Saturday night. 
The lasagna look extremely good but ended up tasting like it was a can of beef raviolis... Yuck! And I was excited for the sushi and all they do is bring a already prepared dish from the fridge and STACK THE OLD SUSHI ON TOP OF THE \"FRESH ONES\" no thanks! 

For the price paid I would expect to see them preparing it fresh on the spot! And only 5 types to choose from?? The only good dishes we had that were great was the fruit and salad... NEVER EVER AGAIN! We are going to try the buffet at Cesar's place next and I heard it's always fresh! So we will see in the next review.."}
{"text":"We had a really nice lunch/dinner today. We paid for the seafood buffet, as we've been wanting to try it ever since they combined the two buffets. The seafood selections were good-- lots to choose from and most were pretty tasty (like the ono). We still ventured over into the regular buffet, as I love some of their Asian dishes, along with fruit and salads. The desserts were what I wasn't crazy about-- the gelato was rather grainy and the other things I tried just weren't that great. Overall, we will come back-- but will probably just do the regular buffet, since crab legs and other seafood dishes are still included in that. And our second waiter was great (first guy not so much, but he left soon)!

3/23/17: We went back for dinner last night, and I was so disappointed. Dinner was a lot more than the lunch price, yet there didn't seem to be anything different except some crab legs that were so small, it was impossible to get anything out of them. Their salad selection is terrible-- there is nothing but fruit or a green salad that's worth eating there...... several weird little salads that no one was taking. For such a big buffet, you'd think that they'd have a huge salad section. I still like their Asian section, but other than that, there just isn't enough to warrant the higher price. The food is pretty ordinary. And their dessert section seemed to be half \"NSA-- No Sugar Added\", which seemed a bit excessive to me. The gelato is still grainy and not very flavorful. We were seated in the Platinum card section (which is supposed to get a little more attentive service, cloth napkins, etc.), and our waiter hardly even acknowledged us the whole time-- dirty plates on the table, no refills, etc. This buffet used to be a big deal. I would not recommend it to anyone these days. They need to visit some of the other buffets around town and see what they're doing, and make some changes."}
{"text":"Seafood was old and stale crab legs were rubber (over cooked) and king crab claws tasted like trout that had been left in the sun. We were seated at a booth when we returned with our food someone else had our seat. They seated another couple there so I took my receipt off the table and wandered around looking for a new spot to eat servers don't help with that there to busy cleaning 15 tables left full of garbage.So to continue with poor food quality we ended up paying 100.00 for shrimp and mash potatoes with fried mini corn dogs yes the prime rib was tough too. The part that made us laugh the most was after our dinner we see cans with paper being placed on the tables Lmao you see we had to use napkins and stack our used crab legs and shrimp shells on it because our server I guess didn't think we were good enough for that she picked up the mess but did she bring a bucket for our next plate ....nope I mean it is a Buffett and she didn't know we weren't getting a second plate of rubber smelly crab but again the shrimp was good and I enjoyed my 75.00 mini corn dogs but hence will NEVER return."}
{"text":"This was supposed to be an all you can eat lobster buffet. But when we went in for $57 a person they gave you a little ticket the crew had to give them to get a lobster only one lobster was allowed and it was teeny. The food was very good there but not for $57 a person not with one little lobster that was about three bites. And this buffets not worth it"}
{"text":"This buffet is worse than the Buffet at Mandalay Bay!  $32.99 a person and the food wasn't even fresh.

This used to be the premier buffet in Vegas... Sadly, the quality,  service, atmosphere has all changed for the worse.

If you don't mind paying over $30 for a truly pedestrian buffet, this is your place. Otherwise,  spend $9 more and go to the Bellagio!

Sorry guys... this was a big fail.  Unfortunately,  THIS is where we went to celebrate Dad's 75th Birthday.... we owe you one Dad!"}
{"text":"We ate at both buffets last night and the food was awful. The best thing I had to eat was the salad. All of the seafood was over cooked, rubbery, dried out, and tasteless. At one point, the Rio use to have the best seafood buffet in Las Vegas, but not anymore. To me it seems like it was a bad ideal for them to combine both buffets. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back, the food was great and Robert was Nice Mimosas didn't stop coming."}
{"text":"Been to many Total Rewards buffet but this is the winner hands down. Robert was so attentive and informative on where to go and what to do!!  We will be staying at Rio and when we come to Carnival World and Seafood Buffet - we will ask for Robert's section!!  Way to go Rio!  Robert is an amazing example of pride in his position with your company!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those \"3 star is a bit low but 4 star is a bit high\" debates for me. This was the most expensive buffet on our trip and not the best, but not the worst either. Since we stayed at the Rio for 2 nights, we received two $10.00 off coupons per person for the buffet so our total price for the both of us came to $82.17 (including tax) without the coupons our bill reflected a $109 price tag.

Decent waiting time in line, (we hit this buffet on a Monday at 5pm) and the service was pretty typical. They were neurotic about checking our seafood pass stamps, I was actually checked 3 times while trying to get my food AFTER already being checked going into the seafood area so this was a tad annoying. When we go back (which we will) I will not pay the extra for the seafood portion because aside from the cold shrimp that was amazingly large and tasty, the rest of it was quite disappointing (on the seafood end). When they advertise all you can eat lobster, its a lie. there is lobster, but IN the dishes. not actual lobsters to choose. The fish could have been prepared a bit better in my opinion and the meat in the crab, shrimp, and crawfish was a joke. The rest of the buffet however was quite pleasing and offered a great selection of pretty much anything you might be craving. The desert selection wasn't very big considering, but still very good. You will definitely find a great selection, and decent food, but for the price I would expect a little better \"chef\" quality. Our waitress was wonderful and the restaurant was clean but I really didn't feel I ate my money's worth here."}
{"text":"So sad to give this place such a bad rating but wow did that buffet suck. What happened to this place!? This used to be one of my favorite buffets in Vegas years ago but the quality has just gone way down. When we got there I was even wondering \"Wow there's no line on a Sunday night\" and now I know why.

You have an option to upgrade to the seafood buffet, which the cashier did not initially tell or ask us. We actually found out through our hostess, then my aunt who paid for all of us was upset that we had to go all the way back in line when she should of told us in the first place. But then again it didn't really matter cuz there wasn't even that many people lol. So we ended up upgrading which gave us access to an extra seafood buffet which was NOT worth it. Please save yourself some money because everything was either flavorless or overcooked. The regular priced buffet still comes with snow crabs and jumbo shrimp cocktail which was really the only items that tasted ok. Everything else sucked. 

So the actual buffet does have many options to choose from, however, everything I picked was so bland or just tasted like crap. The only thing that was good was the prime rib. Even the desserts weren't good anymore. I still cannot believe that years ago this was one of the best buffets and now I don't see myself returning again unless it's free lol. 

I really hope they can make a come back in the future."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the worst Buffet we have ever been too!  I tried a bit of everything trying to  find something to like but there was nothing worth your time to eat.  Really, really bad.  Everything was overcooked and/or bland.  Wow."}
{"text":"It not expecting that I want it. No lobsters, no crabs legs, no oysters. I thought it was the best in Las Vegas but it not."}
{"text":"The quality of food has DETERIORATED GREATLY since I've been here many years ago!  TIP for crab leg lovers: DO NOT UPGRADE for seafood if that's what you plan to pile your plate with.  In the regular section they have steamed and cold snow crab legs!  The only difference in the seafood section is that they have a few more items.  There are plenty of seafood items, including sushi, in the regular section.  

I won't return only because the crab legs weren't even that good.  Actually, nothing stood out as far as taste.  Our server, Carol, was great, though."}
{"text":"Sorry.  but what a horrific disaster! Food was dry and tasteless. payed $69.19 for 2 Sunday morning.  
We loved our server ofelia she kept our mimosas coming cause she knew we didn't like our food.  She's the diamond in the ruft of this horrendous so called restaurant. Thank you OFELIA for the great service!!!"}
{"text":"We always make the buffet our last meal before heading home since it's a long day of travel. Each experience has been great! Food selection & service is above par. Our server Robert in the Platinum section made it extra special today. He has such a warm & friendly demeanor. He found out it was my birthday & that I loved pancakes & surprised me with this! I have to mention the entire staff is wonderful but Robert made this trip extra special! Thank you Robert!"}
{"text":"This is the reason why we book our stay at The Rio. We love to eat at this buffet it's been the best buffet we've visited in Las Vegas until now. Not sure what happened but the food is not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming unless you have time to wait in a short line for an empty restaurant..   Came here Sunday morning before the drive home.  We were pleased to see there were only five people waiting in line.  The restaurant wasn't even half full.  We stood in line.  And we stood and stood and stood.  There's was no reason for it.  While waiting in line,  I yelped the reviews and saw that most people are saying the food quality and service has gone down.  I still have no reason why those ladies up front were making us wait.  When a few people began to complain,  they simply walked away.  Needles to say we took off...  Glad we did..  We probably saved $40 and got better service."}
{"text":"Use to always love coming here to grub when I would be in Las Vegas but the food options and quality have greatly dropped to what they use to offer years back. Mediocre buffet compared to many you can choose from in Vegas so choose wisely if you insist on coming here. Besides the food our table server Arden provided really good customer service which made things a bit easier due to being around polite staff who attended our drink orders, refills and table cleaning frequently."}
{"text":"I've been to Rio buffet a couple of times in my life. Today my experience was amazing...especially from our server Robert..he was attentive and funny! He even brought me over a cute mouse pancake. He has a fun personality that I would love to see again next time I visit Rio."}
{"text":"This by far and hands down is the best and most delicious buffet I have ever been to. The atmosphere is pleasant and the choices of food leave you excited for more. I absolutely love dining here, had no regrets and plan to go back. Five stars all the way!!:)"}
{"text":"Smelled funny inside, like sewage. The food was not good...pay all that money for sub quality food! ($69.20 for two people @ brunch buffet)....then wouldn't give us a table for 10 without everyone being there....but they had PLENTY of empty tables!"}
{"text":"This buffet is alright. It's not the best in town but wasn't the worst either (flamingo is the worst lol) they did have some pretty cool options like the burger station where they make you a legit burger and I liked that each station is actually separated by ethnicity and not all mixed up (Mexican station, Asian station, etc.) And the food did taste great and fresh but there was nothing here to make them unique or stand out.

The seafood station was alright. It wasn't the best seafood buffet I've ever had but again, not the worst. It's an extra $15 per person for the seafood. I honestly say don't do it. They were all like finger foods, lobster Mac and cheese (I didn't taste the lobster) and cold seafood (shrimp, crab legs, etc) it just wasn't as big as I thought it would be.

We only came here bc we had comp entry and upgrade to seafood but I don't think I would pay for to come to this one. Cesar's buffet was amazing but expensive af! Lol if you're staying near the Rio and are looking for food, then yes come here but don't get the seafood upgrade. I promise you it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Less than mediocre food. I came here for the seafood buffet, which as I came to find out, would not open for another 3 hours. I was starving so I decided to stay for the regular buffet. The food is absolutely terrible. Tasteless, and stale. I pretty much tried everything they had and the only thing I found edible was the garlic break. Definitely skip this place while you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came back to the carnival buffet after a couple yrs and boy has it changed!!  It cost $80-$90 for 2 of us for dinner now!!  It is now combined with the seafood buffet which makes it actually smaller.  Because if you want the seafood part it cost about $20 more for dinner.  It takes up at least 3 sections that used to be part of the normal buffet.   

Overall the food has gone down hill.  The prime rib was cooked well looked good but was chewy as hell!!  Fried rice greasy!!  The only part that was good was the desserts!!  Won't be coming back anymore!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of different foods. Paid extra for the seafood section . There were lots of different choices like crawfish, stone crab, snow crab, oysters muscles etc but I was only interested in crab legs. Unfortunately they had no flavor. They tasted like they were boiled in plain water with no salt or any seasoning . If they had some salt in the water they would get 4 stars but not sure even if they taste good it it's worth an extra $27"}
{"text":"This is my family restaurant my wife and I have been coming since 2012 and it is always been great food and awesome customer service... Love you guys!!!"}
{"text":"The seafood here is disappointing and flavorless. If you are looking for a good place for crab legs specifically this is not one of them. I could tell the crab legs were not fresh due to the flavor and how the meat came out when I cracked them open. The different sides available was nice however most people come to have a good time with some crab legs and therefore it wasn't worth the money. I had better crab legs at red lobster 2 weeks ago."}
{"text":"There's a good selection of food, but the taste of the food is not that great. There are a few exceptional choice like the bbq skewers,  rotisserie chicken, and desserts. The food just does not make you feel like your money is worth going. The desserts are pretty good. However the selection of desserts is very few. You can tell the selections are low because the place is not crowded every time I pass by. It's just not worth paying for."}
{"text":"Wife and I went because we got vouchers from a time share presentation.  The variety was amazing, staff was great and the desserts tasty (loved that they had ice scream/gelato).  However, that's where the good ends (and why I gave it 3 rather than 1 or 2 stars).  The quality of the food was \"bottom of the barrel.\"  Many of the salads were ok, but the seafood was clearly not top quality.  IMHO, if there's one food type that must be top quality or not offered at all , it is seafood.  If you are looking for quantity over quality, this is your place.   if you are looking for less variety but higher quality, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bad:

I'm so disappointed where this seafood buffet has gone. It's been years since I've been here, since they used to be in their own location. 

The quality has dropped. The lobster was dry as were other fish offerings.  The shrimp in the shell were not fresh.  

Good:
The Dungeness crab was good as were the King Crab legs.  My wife said the Poke was good too. 

Definitely not worth the extra price, around $60. 

For that price I'd much rather eat at the Wynn Buffet for $50. Their quality is much, much better.



To Rio's Crystal C.,
I'm pleasantly surprised that you respond to these posts on Yelp.  It's nice to see that you folks take an interest in our opinions.

However, your invitation to return is quite empty as you don't give me any incentive to return to try a $60 meal in the hopes that it will be better.  Unlike some others, $60 is not a \"drop in the bucket\" for me or my four guests.  Not even a gift certificate for a meal or drink.  And since you didn't mention any action, I'm assuming that you didn't even check with your cooks to see what may have happened the night of our visit.

I take part of the blame (for having a bad meal) as I didn't do any research on Yelp before my visit this time.  If I had I wouldn't have suggested to my friends to eat there.  I discovered on Yelp that there are many others who also reported to have had less than stellar meals at Carnival Buffet.  I simply relied on past visits at a time when your seafood buffet was the talk of the town.  Sadly, like many things in life, those days seem to have passed.

My visit was on a Friday night, a time when most hotels/casinos/restaurants are full of people.  We did not find that the case with the Rio.  We found that even the casino was empty.  Maybe Rio's time overall has passed on too.  

Maybe Penn & Teller should work some of their magic to bring back some of Rio's greatness.

For sure I will do my homework before I visit a buffet in Las Vegas the next time I'm in town.

Until then I wish you and the hotel the best of luck.

{"text":"So we were told that this was the BEST buffet in Vegas. They lied. A lot. It's VERY expensive ($41 with tax & drink), and the food was super sub-par. They boast in their seafood but it wasn't prepared properly. The crab legs were luke warm, and not seasoned well. The Asian Cuisine was actually very good, but the Mexican food was awful. I felt like I wasted money here. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"OMG, I always come here when I visit  Vegas three times a year, buying the 24 hour buffet. I usually come here for two dinners each time I visit. 

To tell you the truth, one of my joys visiting the buffet is sitting in the VIP section and getting such excellent service from Robert. 

To my dismay, the buffet is open for BLD only on weekends. Weekdays are only open for dinners at 4:00p.  We were only able to see Robert for 20 mins. due shift changes. 

Food:  Prime rib melted in 
my mouth. Sushi was good. Egg noodles were good, but there was no roasted duck to add to my soup. I have to say that the desserts were very good, but my son says bring back the raspberry sorbet and strawberry ice cream."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience thanks to Robert, was probably the best waiter all Memorial weekend and made my first experience at Carnival Buffet in Rio memorable enough to come back to dine here on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Big selection of food, price is more reasonable than other Vegas buffets. Food is mediocre, what do you expect? It's a buffet with buffet quality food."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Food was barely warm. Lobster no flavor. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Came here 2 weeks ago on a Sunday and upgraded to the Seafood Buffet for access to the \"secret seafood section\".  Not sure why other ratings are so low.  I had a lot of fun here granted that I've never gone before so I had no expectations.  I came with a buffet mindset and didn't expect super quality.  It didn't let me down.  

I opted for the 1 lobster instead of the 5 tails.  I was praying to the lobster gods that it wouldn't let me down and it didn't.  It was okay.  Wasn't the best but I wasn't upset.  I do admit that little cut up slip of paper with \"LOBSTER\" on there was a bit ghetto for a buffet that cost quite a bit...

They had large mussels in the secret section and I was very surprised by the quality.  Not typically a mussel girl but that was very good.  I also typically hate snow crab legs at buffets as they are generally way overcooked with no flavor.  The legs here though, were very delicious.  I did notice that the secret section had better legs than out there in the regular section.

Dessert and carving station were fantastic as well.  I will definitely go back.

TIP: stop by the tix4tonight booth and get a dining card before you go.  $5/person but it will save you money for the buffet.  I think it's too overpriced without it."}
{"text":"Essentially the torture of food (hot trays,  hot plates, crabby servers,  leathery meat,  wilted vegetables,  etc... aside from being pricey (Sunday dinner was about $40), the buffet had so many rules and limitations that even if you purchased the seafood add-on,  you couldn't actually enjoy AYCE. 

Very emblematic of the Rio - a very good savings but somewhat run down, uninterested in improvement and more like a booze cruise. 

Also the obligatory photo in front was really really annoying."}
{"text":"I have been to this buffet enough times, I would have thought I had reviewed it by now.  I have no photos but when I go back I'll get some.

I met friends from New York for dinner.  The big change since the last time I was here is the combination of the Seafood Buffet with the regular buffet.  I had never tried the Seafood one when it was in the Masquerade Tower.  Now they are in the same large room.  The east most part of the buffet where they had salads is now the area designated as the seafood buffet.  You pay the $20 up charge and they stamp your hand and it's checked as you enter the area.  The woman on duty let me enter to just take a look and see if it was worth the extra.  Except for small lobster tails and peeled shrimp, I didn't see the value of doing this.

As most buffets, this is divided into stations with Asian, meats, salads, desserts, in separate areas.  The buffet is just about the same as it always has been.  Perhaps it's gone down a bit but they still have an Indian dish which is something not on many buffets.  The prime rib was overcooked for me but I come to expect that at buffets.

The desserts are good but the choices available are not as ample as before.  

Not a bad buffet but not up to the standards of some of the pricier ones at some Strip properties."}
{"text":"Everything was going great UNTIL my god daughter found a cockroach in her shrimp. While they refunded our money they refused any other compensation after talking with several managers. Not very impressed with customer service."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant/buffet because we were staying at the Rio Hotel and were looking for somewhere to eat before going to the Penn & Teller Comedy Show. It was 7:00 when we got in line and by the time we got to the front it was 7:40pm our show was going to start at 9:00 pm and we didn't want to be late. We decided to tell the lady who was seating guests about this and she was kind enough to let us go in early. The food was good and fresh. There was a large selection. If you want specialty seafood you have to pay $20 extra on top of the $34.99 for the regular buffet. Overall I would recommend this buffet but I suggest going early and being prepared to wait."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I am still standing in line an hour later, looking at empty tables. Get your s**t together Rio."}
{"text":"SO incredibly not worth it. $35 per person with optional $20 add-on for the seafood. Unlimited beer and house wine for $13 (aka, box wine). We decided to go without the seafood after reading numerous reviews saying that it wasn't worth it. But honestly, this whole place ain't worth it. The best food was maybe the bowl of noodle soup I got (which is like your hospital cafeteria quality). There were some dry cuts of meat, some pizza, some pasta, some sushi, Chinese food... none of it stood out at all. Deserts were very pretty, and may be the highlight. Honestly, this is the first buffet I've been too where I didn't walk out feeling overstuffed - maybe that's a good things? Ha!

I know it's Vegas so you expect everything to be overpriced, but there are other overpriced options that at least, look and taste a bit better."}
{"text":"The bad: Pricey Buffett, you got to pay $20 extra for seafood. 
as if that wasn't enough, you still have to serve yourself fountain drinks. (not even cheap Buffetts do this) smh. 


The good: inspite of all the negative things about this Buffett, something good about it was hostess Alexandra from Guatemala!! She was so nice and sweet with lots of charisma and great attitude!! She literally makes you feel like home!! I hope all hostess in other restaurants were like her.... We really hope to see her there when we return to this buffet!! Overall the food was good and dessert was good too specially the creme brulee!"}
{"text":"I remember it was one of the best in Vegas but now its just kinda gone down hill. It was ok this time, but it could of been so much better. 

The food was very disorganized and all over. There were breakfast items next to lunch items. The Desert part of the buffet was lacking and almost out of everything. Our server barely cleared our table.

The positives were the chef behind the omelet bar listened and actually made what I asked for. The chef making pancakes made some awesome oreo pancaked that were delicious. Lastly we did enjoy the choose your own adventure Pepsi machine."}
{"text":"Love Love Love and AMAZING service.

My husband and I came to Vegas for a much needed getaway.  We did not stay at the Rio, but we heard the buffet was amazing and it did not disappoint!  Crab legs, prime rib, sushi, benedicts, dim sum, and on and on and on...  not to mention unlimited champagne and mimosas.

The food was delicious and the service was even better!  Our Server's name was Pat and I have never seen someone work harder.  He seriously did not stop moving the entire time.  Our tasty mimosas were delivered without ever having to ask!  He was basically a mind-reader.  He was friendly, quick and always had a smile on his face.  Please reward him for his exceptional service.

Thank you!  We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's ok, the primerib and duck were the stars. The rest of the food was average or below average. We did not do the seafood section, not really worth it and really you get some seafood with the rest of the buffet any how.

Overall, it's an ok buffet by other places standards but for begas, I expected more, especially for the price."}
{"text":"This buffet was the best we've been to during our Vegas trip. If you like seafood you need to come here and get the seafood buffet add on. Crab legs, clams, mussels, shrimp, lobster, crawfish several different ways everything your seafood loving heart desires. The service was amazing! Totally coming back here next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my late mother's birthday and I'm sad to say that the quality has really gone downhill. I added the seafood option (used a coupon from a local ticket booth dropping price from $50 to $30) and for $30 it was ok at best. There is a better seafood spot here in Texas (See my Tokyo One review). The service was outstanding as well as the Prime Rib. For $50 I would've expected better quality (not quantity) of items. The lobster tails were a joke as well as the cold crab legs. It is time to celebrate a new tradition elsewhere."}
{"text":"Basically, the Rio Buffet has two entrances. One is specifically for just their main buffet, the Carnival Buffet, and the other is their Seafood Buffet. 

We went to try the Seafood Buffet after hearing so many people rave about their selections! You enter a separate entrance and once you enter, your arm is stamped with an invisible ink. Every time you try to enter the seafood line, an attendant will be checking your arm to see if you've been stamped. You're also seated in a separate section of the dining area, which is closer to all the seafood. They also place a bucket for your table for convenient shell disposal. 

With the seafood buffet, you also have access to the rest of the buffet lines. But if you're splurging for the seafood buffet, you're probably just going to spend most of your time focusing on the seafood. 

At first glance, it's pretty great. I almost thought this place was better than Bacchanal over at the Caesars when basing it solely on seafood options. They had baby lobsters, snow crab, king crab, variety of shrimp and fish, scallops, and many more. They even had sashimi! (O m g blocks of salmon aka heaven)

But it wasn't that great after all?? The raw seafood tasted fine but all their hot food was pretty low in quality. It had a weird taste and some of them have obviously just been left sitting under the hot lamp for too long. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and enjoyed our meal JUST for our whole party to be faced with hella stomach issues later that evening. Maybe it was the seafood? Maybe it was the hot food? But nope. Never again. For that price, I'm going back to Bacchanal."}
{"text":"Price would be fine, if the food was quality food. The seafood is very overcooked. Crab legs have no flavor and the tea is instant. Your better off not paying for seafood side as the crab legs are included in the lower price Buffett."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge 2016 27/116

Located at the Rio, serving up a very extensive buffet featuring the foods of the world and seafood for about $35.00. This is one of the cheaper Vegas buffets, off the main strip. We arrived Sunday morning around noon and there was zero wait. This is totally against the norm so don't hate me if you end up waiting. So, you pay up front, then wait to be seated. If you have a players card, you can save a bit.

Tons of choices from Mongolian BBQ, Ramen/Udon bar, salad, lots of seafood, yakitori, dim sum, terrible sushi, fresh pancakes, waffles, omlettes, bacon, sausage, bagels. Almost everything you can think of. Most of the food is sitting out. So it is not made to order.  Its buffet food. Its not suppose to be amazing.  Stick to the custom stuff that is made in front of you, and all will be good.
The line of food is huge. Make sure you walk all the way down to both ends, so you won't miss anything.

The real beauty was in the desert bar. My eyes almost popped out of my head.  Lots and lots of enticing treats that guarantee you to leave 2 pounds heavier. I am taking crepes, cookies, cupcakes, pies, moose, chocolate,  Gelato. Thats right, about 10 flavors of Gelato. 

Server was super attentive. Made Sure plates were cleared and drinks were Refilled.  Even though he gave us a hard time about saving seats for our friends who were in route, because 4 of us were hogging up 2 tables. Sorry but we were starving and wanted to start eating. But, If your entire party is not there, they will not let you sit down. Even if if the place is completely empty, they frown upon seat saving. Lame. 

As we were lingering near the exit he personally thanked us for the generous tip we left and said he truely appreciated what we left.

The buffet is decent, inexpensive and filling.

{"text":"Go to the Red Rock casino and spend your cash there this place is way overpriced for what you get. Or just pay for the regular buffet instead of the seafood. I went through the seafood line and got crab legs they were a bit on the small size. My hubby told me they had a whole other side past the dessert this is their regular buffet side.  When I went over to that side omgoodness they had huge crab legs, we would never have had to pay for the seafood buffet if I had know this. Such a waste of 54.00 dollars not even worth it. Really disappointed after all we heard about this place. On the up side the Rio hotel was fun we got to see an 80s cover band for free and it really brought back memories with the hubby."}

You have to pay an extra $20 for the \"upgrade\" which gives you access to the seafood area, with this they give you a piece of paper to gets you ONE tiny lobster!  This was a total joke!! I'm paying $20 for this tough overcooked nasty lobster?!?  I am absolutely disappointed with the direction caesars  entertainment is heading and it's likely that I will be taking my business elsewhere!!

Wonderful staff

Food was delicious

Crab legs were fresh

Loved the dessert

My favorite buffet so far!"}
{"text":"Paid extra for the \"seafood buffet\". Totally not worth it. The crab leg section was always empty when I got to it which left me with less than a cluster to choose from. There was no meat carving station and the additional food items didn't look incising enough to try.  All in all I would say don't waste your money. Had it not been for the additional people in my party wanting to go here I would have gotten up and left."}
{"text":"We decided to try this Bridget in Rio. They had seafood night. It was really delicious. The lobster tails were cooked perfectly. The crabs legs were amazing. The raw oysters were fresh. The clams the mussels the shrimps. It's just all endless. They have a great selection. Prime rib burnt ends were so good. I didn't Cafe for their broth in the miso soup ramen Dept. Too salty. The dessert area had so many to chose from. It was good. But I've had better coffee gelato. But def good buffet in comparison to others.  
It was clean and the staff were attentive."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for quite awhile , I Remember when this place used to be the buffet to beat , unfortunately it has went a bit down hill , please don't get me wrong it's still good , just not great hence the average rating , a couple of things that would improve it , would be to stay on top of the food presentation and not let items get dry or look like they have been sitting for awhile , those would be my biggest fixes as many people eat with their eyes first and many items that I'm sure probably tasted ok didn't look appetizing and I just didn't want to risk getting a food Bourne illness with something that looks like it's been sitting out for a bit too long ! Second fix would be to maybe up the flavor profiles a bit as much of what my partner and I tasted were bland , good but missing just a touch of flavor that would have made an ok dish something great ! Some standout dishes were the sesame balls , a sweet flavorful dough with a sweet bean curd inside with toasted sesame seeds outside , the coconut macaroons which were little balls of goodness , ( most desserts were great ) , and a wonderful and flavorful salad that really was the star , I think it was called the mini rainbow potato salad , it had mini colorful potatoes, assorted kalamata olives , crisp green beans , diced mini bell peppers all tossed with some sort of ( tarragon?) vinegarette so good I had two servings and my partner tried mine and had a serving himself ! As for service, everything was self serve including beverages and we had about three different people come clear our plates , ( I hope they tip share , because we didn't know who to tip but left a good one on table ) as our table was well maintained throughout the visit , as for price I do think until they fix their issues I do think it's a bit overpriced at 24.99 for lunch , but this is Vegas and who knows what was old can be new again and I hope they reclaim a fraction of their previous glory !"}
{"text":"The Carnival World and Seafood buffet is a simple attempt to grab a piece of the buffet game that is infamous in Las Vegas. After one walk through the food you will realize that the main objective of the buffet is to get you to spend the extra $20-$25 upgrade for the Seafood Option.  Don't worry, if you are already here and reading - see pro tip below. 

Basically it's a more expensive version of Hometown Buffet - tons of carb and starch filled foods to get you full. So I hope you love rice, noodles, and potatoes. Aim to find a dish they just brought out because if not - it will most likely be warm (def not hot). At least they have ice cream! 

If you aren't willing to pay $20-$25 (depending day of week) extra for the \"Seafood Buffet\" portion, you can count out any Seafood options besides a small offering of battered fried shrimp. 

If you do decide on the Seafood Buffet upgrade - the main dishes to go for is going to be the crab legs and potentially the oysters. The lobster and other seafood options are mostly hit or miss.

Pro Tip: If you do get the Seafood Option - have one person at the table purchase the upgrade and have them be your runner. They only check the Stamp to validate if you have the upgrade right before you enter the Seafood Section. 

Recommendation: Spend a little extra and go to Cosmo's Wicked Spoon or Caesar Palace's Bacchanal Buffet. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"The food quality has gone way, WAY downhill since I last visited this buffet 5+ years ago. I can't believe how bad it is now. Had it not been for our amazing waiter (wish I remember his name, but he was very tall and completely bald) I wouldn't hesitate giving this buffet 1 star. He deserves to work at a much better place. He was cheerful, cleared our plates in record time and kept our drinks filled - really all I ask for at a buffet, on which he did a tremendous job. 

But the food was the crappiest of crap. We went there Saturday around 7:30 pm - prime dinner time - and EVERYTHING looks like it's been sitting there for quite some time. Hardly anything looks fresh, not even the trays I see them just take out of the kitchen. The oysters weren't fresh, the fish (except for the salmon sashimi) had a smell, the meats were tough. I couldn't bring myself to try more items since they all look so sad and dried out. 

The only things I remember being good were the salmon sashimi, mashed potatoes, and coconut gelato. That's a little sad considering they charge $35 for regular buffet and $50 for seafood. Get it together, Rio."}
{"text":"The buffet is well decorated, well attended and has a pleasant atmosphere, which surprised me because it was difficult for me to behave normally due to the quality of the food. I had to spit out most of the foods I ate. I can't believe my neighboring tables were able to hold back loud cursing and gagging noises.

The variety of food was some of the broadest I've ever had at a buffet, but most of the items were close to inedible. 

We paid an extra $20 to get the seafood option. We found out that most of the seafood is available in the regular option, except the lobster. You pay $20 more for lobster. The lobster was terrible...

The dessert selection was easily some of the best I've seen. It's beautifully laid out, the pastries and treats are artfully prepared and cute, many actually tasted as good as they looked. Surprisingly, the cheesecake was bad and almost inedible. 

This buffet cost 2 people $120 not including tip. We were prepared to pay that for what we hoped would be average quality food at a Vegas establishment but where impressed by how bad the food managed to be. Normally I'm concerned about overeating when I go to a buffet, but that didn't become a problem here. Simultaneously the worst and most expensive buffet I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Was excited to finally try this buffet, bought discount on Groupon for Two people with seafood and beer and wine for $105.00
I always read exclusions small print and there are No restrictions!!We arrive in Las Vegas on Saturday 22,Dec and decided to use on one of the 5 nights we were staying in the Rio.
Well we got to register and the woman there said they won't honor the Groupon(I saw 2 other customers with the same Groupon who where turned away)there was a sign which another rude cashier keep putting it in my face!I asked for the manger who never once spoke to me just the rude cashier and We were charged an extra $75.00 because of the holidays!

Now for the food,  not worth the price , lobster tails you get 5 very tiny or one small whole limit by a ticket,not all you can eat!
Crab legs small, no king crab! Shrimp is over cooked.
Very cafeteria tastes!
Not worth the price!!!
Go to Bellagio buffet same price much better food, beautiful dinning room lots of prime seafood choices!
Again the Rio hotel really is going down hill!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the Rio Carnival World & Seafood at 10am on a Saturday morning for their famous weekend brunch and from the start was greeted by friendly staff. Their omelette station was better than some of the best buffets on the strip along with better selection than many other buffets! Best of all our service was crafted to our needs all thanks to our server Robert! Would be coming here on all our Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Not worth the price. Went here years ago (and it was good) and came back on a friend's recommendation but terribly disappointed. It is overpriced, quality sucks, the food does not taste good, and feels like you are at a buffet in some Midwestern city. Actually, I have had better buffets in my hometown, Minnesota. Can't say enough about how bad the experience was. Do not go. Wish I could have my money back!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely. Amazing. Robert P was my waiter and I couldnt be more happy with the service I was given. Will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Holiday pricing for the whole week??  Are you for real?!?!  NO wonder there wasn't a line.   

Haven't been here in years, but it is very noticeable there is a change in food quality.  They also charge an extra $20 for seafood and removed certain baked items in the Asian section.

Kinda sad how they have deteriorated."}
{"text":"Overly priced for the quality of food. For a $55 buffet.....complimentary glass of wine would have been nice, but nope another $12......"}
{"text":"I've tried the buffet from Paris and Planet Hollywood and I gotta say, this buffet tops those two. They have SO MUCH variety of food from Asian, mid-western, American, etc.. They have top quality food, especially the meat. The dessert was okay for me but I'm not much of a sweet tooth. Would I be coming back? Heck yes. This buffet is my first choice!!"}
{"text":"10 yrs in a row at new years. Can I just rent a room here or should I hide in the Bathroom inside the restaurant! I could eat here all meals in my day. I like to eat the gold desserts so when I poop i can actually say it's worth something! So bomb i am getting hungry writing this!"}
{"text":"Been here twice last march and this year January, love this buffet and everyone you ask in Vegas which buffet is best ( because we asked again just to see locals opinions) they've told us here . So much variety . The desserts are flavorful and you can tell the cooks put love into their work."}
{"text":"Best buffet in Vegas. The seafood side is worth the extra cost. Great service and selection. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"I ate a lot of food here, and I was satisfied.  My whole party of three purchased the seafood buffet for the extra add on price.  Fresh selection in the regular buffet and seafood portion.  The attendees were constantly refilling it making sure there were abundant full dishes.  This buffet is massive and has s great selection in the regular portion of the buffet alone with crab so you don't have to buy the seafood add on like we did.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Wow what a terrible place. It should not even call itself a buffet. Should called itself a row of bunch of shit we call food. If you get the seafood addition it comes out to $54. Which is comparable price wise to Bellagio, Cesar's, M, you know... The good places. This place is not worth remotely close to what they charge. Selections are terrible. Carving station only had well done meats. When asked if he had less cooked meats he said \"this is all I got.\" That's some top notch customer service right there.  Don't get scammed into coming here. So many better options in this town.  AVOID AT ALL COST."}
{"text":"Probably the worst meal I've ever had in Las Vegas in 20 years.  This used to be two separate decent buffets, with the seafood buffet actually being good, and the carnival buffet being a solid value.  Now, they are combined, overpriced ($37 for dinner, $57 with seafood), and actually bad.  The seafood part is worse.  Flavorless, \"off\" tasting, and bad texture, plus a generally mediocre selection (snow crab legs, but small, and the worst lobster I've ever seen; not even worth eating.)

Inattentive and slow service (might have just been my server), and the cheap ingredients sections were bad too (desserts, Mexican, Italian should all be decent, but were very limited in selection and very weak.)

Fortunately as a Diamond I didn't have to wait in line, but I still regret dining here."}
{"text":"We had a great server at brunch.  ROBERT is attentive and super courteous.   He checked on us enough but not hovering.  He did a fabulous job and you can tell he's in the right career as a great people person.  I hope he's gotten rewarded for his great customer service."}
{"text":"Wow talk about no service at this buffet...you even have to get your own water from the self service machine and bus your own tables too!"}
{"text":"To say I'm disappointed on what this Buffet has turned into is an understatement.   This used to be the best buffet in Vegas but now the food quality is horrible and service is poor.  We added on the seafood and the lobster was gross and i didn't finish it as I was afraid i would get sick.  This is not a 35 buffet this is more like a 9.99 buffet don't waste your time or money.  There is far better buffets out there at similar prices."}
{"text":"Robert was very exceptional at his service I really loved the service through diamond. I would recommend this buffet to anyone"}
{"text":"I never give bad reviews unless they are completely legit. $20 for a 5 yr old is robbery he ate like $5 worth. The quality of this Buffett has went completely downhill over the past few years. The choices suck the quality is like the stratosphere now but very expensive $85 for 2 adults and 1 kid is robbery. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Every time my family and I would visit Vegas,  Carnival buffet was a must go. I use to come here back in the days when $17.99 was the price for all-inclusive, then went up to $24.99 and so forth. I understand that all prices eventually go up, it's cool with me; it's Vegas and it's only once in while! WELL, after excitingly waiting all day to eat tasty food, pffff not only did we all came out feeling like our traditional visit to Carnival's Buffet ended right then and there, the food in general was either too salty, too dry, too old, too cold and not enough good choices for the prices they now have. Oh and now if you want sea food is $20.00 dlls more? If I knew this was gonna happened,  I would have rather not wait all day and go enjoy a good show with that money instead...the day before coming to Carnival's buffet, we went to eat at the Le Village Buffet in the Paris Hotel, their food options were less, but EVERYTHING, even their fruit was a-ma-zing!!! Not to add that you can go to Groupon and get dinner for two and pay only $59 dlls, PLUS it also includes ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK from beer, champagne and wine! Moreover, I should have listened to my instinct and read the reviews for Carnivals buffet this time...come on Rio, all other buffets are bringing up their game with delicious food, the only thing your bringing up is the prices!!!"}
{"text":"Many years ago I remember my first time ever paying for a buffet using a machine in the wall. After standing in line for hours at places like Bellagio or Paris I welcomed the technological advancement. This place is huge - you obviously don't get that personal touch that maybe some thirst for so much... but for the record I am a self check out kind of person and don't mind.

If you are a Platinum or higher rewards member you get that extra attention and better treatment. You get to skip ahead the line and go into a special room to pay. Its nice, trust me. Make friends with a whale if you can.

Food is very good. Enough people go here and it is popular enough so that food is fresh. Amazing dessert selection. Fancy ice creams -- be sure and leave some room.

A solid choice especially if you are staying at this resort. Really, there is no reason to ever leave the Rio during your entire stay. Pool is great, buffet is fine, Voodoo lounge has unbeatable views and is a good value."}
{"text":"So this is my second time eating at this buffet but (the first time was delicious), this time the food was discussing. I don't know if they have different cooks but for the what they are charging the food should taste better. Especially the seafood. I would recommend you to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My friend and I were doing a girls weekend in Las Vegas for something very special to her. After our business was conducted we wanted to celebrate, because it turned out to be a happy experience.  We decided to eat at  Carnival World & Seafood Buffet after my recommendation to her because I have eaten there on many visits to Las Vegas and felt it was one of the better value buffets in Las Vegas. In the past, I have never experienced having to pay extra for the \"special seafood section\" We had the option when paying for our meals to pay an $15.00 a piece for the upgrade. We should have walked the \"extra\" section before decided to pay the extra as the regular part of the buffet was costly enough at $34.99. Our total bill came to $108.13 including tax. In the past, we have never had to pay \"extra\" for crab legs, or shrimp. The \"extra\" section included what was supposedly lobster, crab both sliced opened sections, clam chowder, shrimp and crab legs you had to crack yourself. Let me start by addressing the \"extra\" seafood section. Awful! The clam chowder was tasty but the potatoes in the chowder were under cooked and hard. The supposed lobster was like a rubber band hard to get out of the shell and tasteless. The crab tasted extremely salted and still frozen and lacked flavor. I am one that adds salt to virtually everything I eat and when I acknowledge that a dish is overly salted it definitely is an issue. I love crab and so does my friend and we can sit for hours eating nothing on a buffet other than crab and salad while our husband patiently waits for us.   And talking about salad. It was not even offered on the buffet. I thought it something I missed, so, I had my friend walk the buffet looking for it. She could not spot it either. When we realized that there was something wrong with the lobster, crab, and the clam chowder we asked to speak with the Buffet floor manager. He came over and saw that we had put all the still not eaten of the lobster, crab in the discard plate. When we explained our issues with the food the young man was very condescending and in essence told us we did not know what we were talking about. He took our discard plate with all the items we had not eaten (whole sections of crab, lobster) and said he would talk to the chef. I told him because it was so salty I thought that perhaps they added extra preservatives to the food. He came back a few minutes later and said the chef said that they do not add preservatives. He offered to have the cook make us fresh but by then we were turned off and did not want any more seafood. The buffet manager walked away and never offered any other options to us. The only positive experience was our waiter. He was very attentive and brought us our drinks and refills.  This food experience tainted our whole evening. We filed a complaint with the front desk, and the gal that took our written report (review) told us someone would get to us that evening or the latest the next morning. That did not happen, and it was not until I got home and made many calls to different management at the hotel including risk management did I get any satisfying result.  One other issue, when my friend made the reservation for the hotel she specifically asked if we could check in early. The clerk told her if there were rooms available that would be no problem. When we went to check in we were told that check-in was at 4:00 pm and if we wanted to check in earlier there would be an additional $20.00 charge in additional to the resort fee. Since we had an appointment we wanted to get into a room so we could freshen up after our long drive. Amazing! Since we paid the extra $20.00 they had a room available immediately. Since rooms were available after we paid the extra $20.00 why did we have to pay that extra charge? Is that a scam? Probably. Oh by the time I made at least 6 follow-up calls, I finally got a call back that they were going to reimburse us for the buffet. Why wasn't this addressed initially, rather than make me jump through hoops and waste my valuable time and angst?  It was not a matter of the refund it was a matter of the way it was handled and not following through."}
{"text":"We knew this dump was a dump from the jump, but decided to give It a shot anyways. To start, it's expensive. If you enjoy flushing your money down the toilet, approx. $70 (no seafood for us) worth of money, then this might be that place for you! Everything sucks here. I found myself with a plate containing only mashed potatoes and with an empty heart."}
{"text":"Our waiter  Orlando is Terrific,  Amazing  and all around  a very nice person. Every time we come to Vegas we come here because of  Orlando. He really makes you feel like family.  The food is good and the price is not that bad. Thanks Orlando for always  making  us feel like family.  Hope to see you again soon. God bless."}
{"text":"IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEALTH STAY AWAY.

Sad to say this has become one of the worst buffets in Vegas.

When I first went in the early 2000s, it wasn't amazing or anything, but I ate my weight in tempura shrimp and fried scallops (no small feat considering it cost $80 in early 2000s dollars) and felt satisfied I got my money's worth. Took home one of those Carnivale-themed foot-long souvenir booze cups to boot.

When I came back again last year the price went down a little but the value hit rock bottom. The seafood was all completely unfresh, fishy, and slimy (like bacterial death slimy).

The DH and I both have cast iron stomachs and have eaten everything from brains and guts and feet and testicles, to RAW meat including CHICKEN and PORK, with nary a tummy rumble.

But even just SMELLING the raw oysters here made me gag. I can eat dozens of raw oysters in one sitting, plain with nothing on them, but I coudn't even eat a single ONE of the ones here. It smelled like sewage, my body wouldn't let me swallow, and I could feel my stomach heave - I had to discreetly spit it into a napkin or be sick all over the floor.

The \"safe\" cooked seafood was all cold and dry and overcooked to death and sad.

No shrimp tempura. No fried scallops (at least not the big kind; I didn't notice if they had those stupid little bay scallops which are hardly worth eating).

I ended up eating nothing but the plainest sushi rolls and even that made me queasy. The DH hardly ate anything and his nickname is The Finisher."}
{"text":"They should seriously consider going back to the way it was before.  Now you have to pay an extra $20 for seafood and the selection is mediocre, overall the quality falls way below the price you pay."}
{"text":"Where do I start - The lack of customer service or guest experience recovery & tact?  Last night 4 of us went to the buffet (2 moms & 2 babies) and spent $75.75 all for a good time and snow crab legs! Before arriving I called the listed number 702-777-7757 to confirm details: the recording quoted $32.99 for dinner which included snow crab - years past we have always received a discount w/local ID - however we were charged $34.99 and rudely told we would not be given a 25% discount by the dry cashier. Ok moving on.  We continue to enjoy our night and the upbeat environment.  We searched high & low with no success for the snow crab, so I finally asked a waiter who directed me to a seemingly-too-busy-to-deal \"manager.\"  I politely tell him about the cashier, the discount and crab legs and he says \"we quit doing that months ago (referring to the snow crab) and if you wanted a discount you should have asked when you paid *shrugs shoulders*\" I told him that's the only reason we came and that's false advertisement.  When I then called the recording for him, he acted astonished as if it was a fake hotline I created myself!!! -seriously?!? Then rolling his eyes he tells me he will have to \"investigate this number\" because he does \"not know this number\" and give will give me a seafood buffet stamp \"this one time - because we will never do this\" when I ask about my friend, who was getting a dessert for her daughter, I got another eye roll and a \"tell her to find me at the front.\" When my friend returned I told her what had transpired & when we looked towards the cashier station the ladies and manager were all rudely looking at us and clearly gossiping about the situation, as if they were all personally affected.  When she went for her stamp the lady at the register gave her a nasty attitude as well.  To me, this is not about the money spent, or even the changes made to the options currently offered at the buffet ((and I even left a voicemail for the F & B managers)). It is solely the way the situation was handled and more importantly the way the employees acted, reacted and treated us for the duration of our visit.  We were guests of the Rio and deserved respect and fair treatment.  As a company there is a standard of due diligence to follow through with guest experience and this was miserably failed on many levels.  -But YES, I most definitely enjoyed my crab legs either way! - like I said, it's what we came for."}
{"text":"Was very upset with food selection for $60. This place was good years ago. Seats were dirty and whole place looked like and smelled bad"}
{"text":"$20 extra for the seafood buffet is a bit much. To me, this was just your typical casino buffet. Nothing too awesome, but it wasn't too bad. They do offer 25% off with a local I.D. so that definitely makes it worth it."}
{"text":"CWSB has changed dramatically since I came here about 5 years ago. We came on a Wednesday night and it was slow as expected, but the buffet was overpriced and bland. 

First they offer a regular buffet which is $32 or you can add the Seafood which is $25 more. We were wanting seafood so we went ahead and paid $57 for our meal. With the purchase it includes a whole lobster or 6 mini lobster tails. BUT you can only have that ONCE. That's it. One or the other. Kind of sucks. You still get to eat the rest though. The snow crab legs looked like it been there for a week. Some looked dark and over cooked. The meat inside of it was dry too. I had the 6 tails of lobster which wasn't that bad. I'd recommend it over the whole though. Rest of the seafood items were okay at best. The Halibut was sorta bland. 

Carving station was decent. Meat was somewhat tender and moist. They have a few other stations. Mexican, Chinese, Italian. Our favorite part was the desserts. They have ice cream which was the best part. I think it was actually gelato. Other then that probably won't be back again the next time we're in LV."}
{"text":"Well, despite of this place having 2 1/2 stars, we finally went to judge for ourselves. I LOVED IT. If you love seafood as much as I do, go!! Although it was sad that I could only get lobster once(they give you a little voucher if you pay the $20 extra for seafood) it was still one of the best buffets I've been to. It was busy so the food was able to rotate to be fresh every time. I'm so going back, I wish I went sooner!!!"}
{"text":"My sister in law enjoys this buffet, so we always take her here when we visit Las Vegas. She was VERY disappointed when we were at the cash register & the hostess told us that the special seafood buffet was no longer available. There was nothing on any of the websites I checked about this change, even on their own website. We were told that it was discontinued 5 days before our visit. The food was very good but without the seafood buffet, it's just another buffet. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointment with the place. The line is ridiculous and once you pay, it takes another hour to get seat it. The only reason I decide it to try, is to take advantage of the local discount. 

Not worth it. The staff are so disorganized. Better off going to another buffet."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate it lower this business just stole money from me ... Don't pay the extra money for the Seafood buffet it's a waste and it's horrible the regular buffet has many of the same terrible items and the service is also horrible GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK YOU THIEVES I can't stress it enough go to bellagio buffet 
, ceasars or better yet just throw 100$ on the ground and walk away because you will waste your money here"}
{"text":"Seafood is not great quality. Unlimited alcohol is nice but limited. Dessert bar is really phenomenal- if you like desserts I'd recommend this joint. Food is not great though."}
{"text":"I visited here on tuesday.
As advertised it should have been $32.99 
But what they didn't say is that you have to pay $20 more to have access to sea food session.
The food is horrible.. especially Chinese food. 
I would make so much better with so much less money
Please do not even think of coming here please!!!!
$32.99 for this crappy food?? Please save your money...
Please go to bacchanal or Bellagio whatever or don't go to buffet ever here in Vegas...please."}
{"text":"This Buffet is absolutely garbage. There food quality is is 3 of 10. There seafood section is completely closed of unless you pay the extra fee of $18.99 and there sushi o my, it literally is lower quality than that of a grocery store. Absolutely A MUST AVOID."}
{"text":"Great selection of food. Had one of the best server in house (Robert P.). Respect his attitude and willingness to keep the service up par."}
{"text":"If I could give it less than a zero I would. The meatballs were clearly frozen, the hot and sour soup was sub par at best, and everything else I tried was not even worth mentioning. In addition the groupon was not honored completely due to the holiday so it was an extra $15 dollar charge making it $100 for my girlfriend and I. I would have rather eaten at subway."}
{"text":"Noticed an old like odor smell upon entering inside of buffet. Has quite a large selection of food items. Mostly rather low grade food.  High, and very overpriced. Food was not tasty and less than desirable. Hours later after eating at this buffet, I developed stomach pain and loose bowl movements like I've never seen before. Sad to say that was my very first visit and last. I was recommend by shuttle bus driver who told me that the Rio had the best seafood."}
{"text":"This place is actually a 4/5, but I'm giving it a 5/5 because I don't understand why it's rated just as a 2.5/5. That's not an accurate rating at all. Hubby and I visited for breakfast yesterday and we were quite impressed!

The variety was fantastic and everything was the right temperature and was prepared well. 

I particularly enjoyed the tater tots because I loaded them up with cheese sauce, shredded cheese, sour cream and thick slices of bacon. 

They also offer such sweet goodies as churros, waffles and French toast - of which French toast was my favorite due to its great texture. 

There was a cereal station. This can either be for those with simple tastes, or it can be for crazy people like me who enjoy taking French toast to the next level (French toast covered with the vanilla sauce meant for the bread pudding, fruit loops and mini M&M's from the ice cream station). 

There are also some options that aren't necessarily considered breakfast food, like their ribs. They were definitely not the most tender ribs I've ever had, but the BBQ sauce was sweet and delicious!

Dessert wise there was a nice little chocolate mousse I found. But I have to say that my favorite was the Elvis ice cream - a peanut butter banana ice cream with peanuts and swirls of (strawberry?) jelly. 

Since we also stayed at Rio that night they gave us a booklet of coupons, including $10 off this buffet. I can't wait to go back and try lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Quality of the buffet is slightly better than home town buffet.

Meat is bland, salad is unwashed, only good thing here is the seafood that you need to cop out an extra 20 for.

If you want to eat here just eat seafood, otherwise you'll be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Brunch buffet was delicious and our waiter Robert was the best! He was nice and funny and even gave me some pancakes! Thank you Robert they were delicious!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this buffet is absolutely terrible. Much of the food tasted spoiled. The \"lobster\" you get for buying the seafood option are tiny dried things that look more like crawfish. I paid over $50 for this buffet and the best thing was a marinated hot dog. When you are trying to fill yourself with bread at a $50 buffet you know something went very, very wrong. This buffet was a leader in the early 2000's but the quality has steadily declined as the price went up. Steer very clear."}
{"text":"Good value for Money. Came for Brunch, there's enough for every one, nice touch on the asian section (pho, udon, pot stickers, oxtail soup, egg rolls...sushi could be better, though)
Only disappointment= seafood, the crab is cluster (nothing to eat) the shrimp are tiny and unpeeled."}
{"text":"Part of Vegas's intrigue (for me, at least) is the Buffet of Buffets tour, an all-access pass to some of the best buffets the city of sin has to offer!  For 24 hours after time of purchase, your buffet credentials allow you to literally pack it in, to be the glutton you've never before dared yourself to let loose and become.  This--and more!  Much, much more!--for only $59.99.  My review, then, reflects our complete and utter indulgence--our loosened belts and the imminent guilt--touring the Buffet of Buffets.

Rio's \"Carnival World\":
(Dinner, $34.99 without the pass.)
This buffet, sometimes referred to as the \"best buffet in Vegas\" and our first stop on the first night, was easily my favorite.  Although a bit out of the way (we had to be taxied over), Carnival--with its many, many choices (300 selections, to be exact)--shined!  To be sure, that turkey and pork roast carving station was hit hard!  Ironic, I realize, that with so much available, flavors from around the globe, that I should return--and return again and again!--to the turkey, mashed potatoes, and green beans.  (The neighboring Seafood Buffet required a costly upgrade, which we declined, as there was more than enough--including crab legs and oysters!--in the buffet regular.)

Paris' \"Le Village Buffet\": https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas

{"text":"Family trip to Vegas, heard great things about this buffet and their seafood all weekend long, so we gave it a try! Huge variety, great food and even better customer service! Huge thanks to the manager D.J. Kantarevic for the EXCELLENT hospitality. He was the exact definition of what great customer service is all about. From the moment we were standing in line waiting to be seated until the very end of our meal; highly attentive, great personality and kindness! All around, pleased with this visit! We have had nothing but crappy service all weekend, until today. We may have lost at the slots but received such great service at the buffet...made the trip so much better! Thank you Mr. K...Places like this need more people like you!"}
{"text":"Good selections, best was the Mongolian grill. 
Wish they had the combo of sushi and regular when I purchased it but will next time.

Good food, good service"}
{"text":"Brought my parents here for their anniversary dinner after coming here back in November... was very displease that they only serve small blue crab on weekdays. And snow crab on weekends... although a few of the food items had improved from November, several things like the deserts weren't that great. To add to the deserts they had several employees standing around staring but not helping any guest, and then walked away ignoring a my sister and our three kids.. for a fellow employee to then walk by and tell her to \"calm down\" when the she told the kids quietly to hold on, were being ignored. To think I could of gone to a stations casino, got better service and paid half the price.."}
{"text":"We had a group of 7 and went at 5:30 pm so you would think that dinner items would be fresh at that time.  We appreciated the variety of food but nothing tasted good or fresh.  We were very disappointed and some of us were sick afterwards.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Compared to the price of other buffets in Vegas on a regular weeknight, Rio's seafood buffet that gives you one whole lobster or 5 lobster tails and unlimited crab legs and claws is ok for the price.  The quality kept on going down though.

The entire buffet including the seafood area and dessert is humongous. I felt like I could have stayed for hours if I wanted to sample everything. 

I would have given it a 3.5 but what made it a 2 is the customer service. I had a convention bag that had lectures from the classes I attended and I left it on the booth. There was no money or valuable in there except for my convention badge so I reported it missing. The hostess and security guard talked to me like it was my fault that it was stolen. The family next to me told me that it might have been the server because she went to our table while we were getting food. After 5 minutes of the security guard almost interrogating me and making me feel like they won't do anything since it only had a bunch of papers, the table on the other side found my bag under their seats. So either the thief wanna be put my bag back when s/he realized there's no money in it or the family next to us was right, server sat another family in our booth or moved my bag. :( Either way, I prolly won't want to come back here."}
{"text":"The regular buffet is ok, usual faire, but the extra price for the seafood section is so not worth it. Unless you are just going to sit and eat Dungeness crab all day then it's not worth the extra price. Some of the items in the special section that the extra price gets you are also offered on the standard buffet area. It was a waste. My advice is spend the money on a better buffet at cesars or a comparable place."}
{"text":"Stayed at the RIO this past weekend and after years (5-7) of hearing how great this buffet was/is, I finally had the chance to try it. I went on a Sunday, around 4 for an early dinner. The price was 34.99 and the cashier wasn't welcoming. Thankfully the other staff that I met throughout my time at this buffet were great.

The food itself sucked! The selections sucked. I tried some sushi, big mistake, I think the store bought sushi is better. I had some mashed potatoes, chicken, beef tenderloin, clam chowder, and a few other things. The only thing I kinda liked was the Asian soup station. I ordered a Vietnamese beef PHO (First time having PHO), which was pretty good. 

Besides the PHO, the dessert bar was great. A lot of different pastries and gelato. 

I definitely do not recommend this buffet, especially for the price. You're better off going to the buffet at the Palace Station for 10 bucks!!"}
{"text":"Had a decent selection for $34.99. Opted out in paying the additional $20 for the seafood option.
Enjoyed a few of the food they had there, and was very satisfied with the dessert buffet. Wide variety. 

Pro: good dessert

{"text":"A little traveling out of the country for the long weekend, we're in Las Vegas! It's super hot and sunny here, already have a mildly sunburnt nose :( today we had time to hit up the Carnival World and Seafood buffet at the Rio Casino and Hotels! We bought a coupon for around $3/person for 25-30% off the buffer price, which is a pretty good deal! We got one regular and one seafood, which cost us arrive $70 combined. I feel the regular side was underwhelming besides the dessert table. I like how they make the bowl noodle soups to order! The seafood side is sectioned off with someone checking for stamps (which were given when paying at the front in the beginning) with a black light. There was a lot of selection, 4 types of crab legs and tons of other seafood choices such as fish, oysters, shrimps and prawns, scallops, clams, poke, mussels, lobster and some sushi (which looked a like sad). I didn't know the difference between the hot snow crab legs and cold, so I just got the hot ones. Raw oysters on the half shell were fresh but sandy. Best were the lobster and snow crab legs, other crab was average. Nothing much spectacular about the regular menu. There was a huge desert selection, intricate and visually appealing. Lots of raspberry themed items. Most of them are mousses and chocolatey. They also had a gelato bar! I clearly went overboard and got too many desserts after being stuffed with seafood xD overall service was great, attentive and quick! #lasvegas #riobuffet #carnivalworld #seafoodbuffet #riocasinoandhotels #snowcrablegs #lobster #rawoysters #clams #mussels #fish #shrimps #poke #mahimahi #halibut #bittersweetlifefood #foodtra els #adventuresofnotmoostachio #food #dinner #yummy #foodblogger #gastropost"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night around 7:30pm. Being a buffet I had saved an appetite, but I totally regretted not having a snack ready for the almost two hour wait time. Two hours of standing provided a negative first impression on the buffet. My friends and I saw a women faint in front of us. She was given water and was told that she and her party could be seated immediately. My friends and I started thinking we should do the same. 

The price for what was offered was insane. We had coupons, and paid $30 per person; that was way to much. 

By the time we sat down it was 9:30pm. We asked since the buffet closes at 10pm would we only have a half hour to eat. Waiter said we're allowed to stay til 10:30. I thought it unfair to wait two hours in line to only be able to be there for an hour. Plus the food did not taste fresh. I think they stop cooking at 10pm too, and we're eating what's left. 

I liked the ribs the best, but I felt there were no really good options. I was tired after the two hour wait, and getting up to serve myself felt like a bigger hassle than it was. My four friends and myself agreed that this buffet was not worth it. We won't be coming back, and there's plenty of other options available closer to the strip."}
{"text":"I came here one night to the rio buffet the last meal before a surgery. 
Omg this place is crazy enormous. 
I think it ran like $35 pp
But my friend paid for me. 
It was okay, I wasn't that hungry.
But they had a lot, and it's packed all the time 
The line is long but if you are into buffets you will like it
I'm not into buffets at all. 
Only went once. 
The hotel has gone down hill since though."}
{"text":"Cheap price, large selection of buffet items. Only downside is that the beverage is self serve as well with no much service available"}
{"text":"Update 5/28/17
What's up with the bad reviews?  We didn't want to eat here because of it but decided to check it out since we were staying at the hotel.   This was memorial Sunday and it was crowded!  The food is just as good as before and I still LOVE the char siu pork.  Lean with no fat but not dry.  Paid the extra for seafood but really it wasn't necessary cuz they served snow crab as a regular buffet.  The dessert station still great and the server in the VIP room was awesome bringing new drinks and keeping a clean table!  And BTW,  Bachannal still leaves all the dirty dishes on the table!!"}
{"text":"By far the best of all of the Caesars hotels.  Jeanie was an excellent table attendant and made our meal so much more enjoyable with her prompt service, light hearted humor and great attitude."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. It used to be our go to every time we visit Vegas. The last time we went, they took out the Chinese BBQ area and the overall selection has decreased. My son only eats pizzas and fried chicken from buffets but their pizza wasn't all that and their fried chicken totally sucked. I mean, how can you screw up fried chicken??? Now we have to find another go to."}
{"text":"My parents took me to this buffet over the weekend because they wanted to try a buffet that featured seafood. I was a bit skeptical because of the rating on Yelp, but I gave it a chance because my parents were treating. Shortly after we sat down, we all agreed that this was a mistake.

The upgrade to include seafood for our dinner on a Friday night was $20 per person. Okay, fine. Seafood is expensive. But when my parents and I beelined to the seafood area, we discovered that the additional $20 bought us only five lobster tails. We were incredibly disappointed when we ate them too, because they weren't flavorful or fresh. The rest of the buffet foods were pretty forgettable too. I had some sushi, which looked suspicious, and a plate of Chinese food, among some other dishes. My parents tried the prime rib, and for the first time that I can remember, my dad didn't finish his plate. He said that the prime rib was awful. The only foods that I really enjoyed were the desserts. My mom and I liked the crème brulee.

At the end of the meal, my parents and I concluded that we won't be back. With the $20 upgrade, we paid nearly $60 each. Save your money, or spend it at Bacchanal."}
{"text":"Lousy seafood buffet! I've seen a wider range and better selection at Golden Corral and it's not all separate from the other types of food. Also, if your gonna charge someone $60, then you need to hire a staff that actually knows how to shuck oysters. These things were FULL OF DIRT AND CRACKED SHELLS like they took a hammer to them to open them up. No wonder the place was ABSOLUTELY DEAD on a Friday night, but at least the wait staff was nice."}
{"text":"This place was very good! With lots of choices! I would definitely recommend it to all but especially seafood lovers! Price wasn't bad, a little pricey. But really worth every dollar"}
{"text":"The worst buffet I've ever been to. Food was horrible, No taste and not much to choose from. The server kept taking our food that we didn't touch yet but was going to eat. My husband got a prime rib and even had it cooked more and he got up to use the restroom and I went to get food and by the time we both came back he cleared our whole table! Who does that?! The crab tasted old, don't pay for the seafood buffet unless you really want to try it yourself... was an extra $20. Not worth it. Eat at the M buffet."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since 1994.  At one time, this was the best valued buffet in Las Vegas.  Over the years, the price have gone up, but the food has remained the same.  With all the buffet choices in Las Vegas now, I'd have to say that this buffet is good if you are in the area.

My wife and I decided to give it another try for brunch on Saturday only because we had relatives at the Rio.  The buffet was very empty...actually thought it was closed.  We checked it out and said that we'd give it a try again.

Hostess greeted us quickly.  $31 and some change each...then seated promptly.  Our server, Robert, greeted us quickly and took our drink order.  He was very attentive, and quick with our requests.  At one point, he even got my wife a pancake.  For over 20 years, that has NEVER happened.  Now that was service.

Of course, pretty big selections...Chinese, Mexican, Made To Order Soup, MTO Pancakes, Breakfast Items, Japanese, Italian, Carving Station, BBQ, Desserts, and Bar.  They also have a self service drink station now.

This visit we had the prime rib, ham, pizza, sushi, Pho, BBQ, Chinese, and desserts.  Also a little from the breakfast area.  To our surprise, very tasty, good temperature food.  Our last few visits for dinner have been meh.  So much so, that we have not been back for a long time.  Value vs food, for me, is a little pricey.  However, if you compare to the prices on the Strip then it's middle of the road.  If you go on the locals discount or find one available, I'd say good value for what you get.

Price kept me for giving it the 5th star, but service from Robert made it a solid 4."}
{"text":"Paid for the seafood side of this buffet (formerly Village Seafood I think) and found myself impressed. Seafood was fabulous - I barely even tried the rest of the buffet - in fact hubby pointed out I had not gone to the other half of the buffet past the desserts...not sure how I missed it! Anyway, ate my way through the fresh shrimp, king crab legs, and oysters rockfeller - delicious. Tried a few hot dishes and other stuff which was all very good. Really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"DONT BOTHER.  
Feel sorry for tourists thinking this is a wonderful place to eat.
Absolutely nothing good to say.
A waste of our time and money 
We paid the additional $15 per person so it was $100 for two.
Ate here June 2016"}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood buffet when choosing the best off the strip. This buffet beats the Buccanal at Caesar's. Caesars looks fancy but the Rio seafood buffet has a lot more seafood selection than any other buffets in town. I lived in Las Vegas for 12 years and I've had almost all the buffets on the strip. I personally have eaten at the Rio seafood buffet at least 5 times. You can select from lobster tail, large shrimp, oysters, scallops, crawfish, shrimp tempura, tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, scallops salad and much  much more. Locals with local ID receives 25% discount. If you can go with a friend from Vegas. Seafood buffet is open from 3pm but its regular buffet is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years since my family moved to Vegas. I have always had amazing servers and service period. The place is always clean, and the price is always great (especially for locals), but over the years, the buffet has gotten less and less exciting. It's a great place to sit, talk, and eat, but the quality of the food has gone down a bit. There are so many things to eat though that for the price, it is a steal! I love that they have the Asian soup section (I get the pho) and the seafood section with crab legs and shrimp. I like that they now give you a choice between hot and cold crab legs. What I do not like and will never understand is why they merged the Seafood Buffet with it. It's a little sad that it is no longer the same, but I guess it works.

I will still always recommend for people to give it a try!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment :( the only testy item was the peach pudding. Worst sushi ever, bad food overall. This was our las visit. Not worth the line and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Best Overall Service Value Plentiful Buffet in Las Vegas

There are cheaper buffets and there are more expensive places, The Carnival World and Seafood Buffet is the one \"All-You-Can-Eat\" restaurants that is both upper-scale offering at a middle class price.

As a Yelp user that has frequented his fair share of buffets, both high end ($50+) and lower end (~$10), I found that The Carnival World Buffet at The Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino, offers a middle of the road price (~$30+), in turn gives it their all!  

Everyone can pick on a particular dish that they like or dislike, in my case, I'm writing this review because of what I observed and because Yelp users deserve to give The Carnival World Buffet a try! 

As I walked up and down the buffet line I noticed that a patron had picked at the Chinese \"Peking\" roast duck leaving parts scattered all over the serving plate.  What I observed next caught my attention, a cook from the kitchen utilized his tongs to pickup the random parts of the duck and began putting the duck back together as if it had just been put out to serve!  Why was that awesome to see in a mid to higher-end buffet?  Because in a city that relies a lot on showmanship, sometimes presentation is everything, and in this case it was something worth sharing.  I did end up trying everything the Rio buffet had to offer and was more than pleasantly surprised by the superb value and diverse, abundant variety presented!

The last but certainly not least of my experience was the awesome service provided by Debbie from Michigan and Sal, the Carnival World & Seafood Buffet general manager.  When seated Debbie cordially asked my buddy and me what we'd like to drink, I asked her to surprise me with a concoction of her design.  She played along and granted me a mixed juice drink that she refilled at least a handful of times without me even asking!  It was the combination of my buffet line observation, the end-to-end food offerings, and the superb customer service that I asked if the manager was available for comment.  Luckily, Sal was able to greet us with a generous handshake and warm smile, he embraced us with his time, enthusiasm and sincerity.  So not only were we well fed but we were entertained by the stories that only a Vegas professional could share with a couple of out-of-towners.

Not only was this particular experience great, but we went back to the World Carnival and Seafood Buffet at The Rio back-to-back-to-back days, never leaving feeling less than full and without a smile provided by the excellent food and even better service!"}
{"text":"we were looking for a good seafood buffet while in Vegas and asked several locals (ride share drivers, hotel staff, casino staff) and one buffet name keep coming up, Rio.
Rio seafood buffet is a small step above the golden corral or any other buffet.
you pay $20 extra for the seafood buffet portion, not worth it. $120.00 for two people.
you get one lobster (that you have to hack apart) & scrap out the meat.
(some people said you either get one big lobster or 5 little lobster tails, we didnt get a choice, if you do get a choice opt for the 5 little tails, cracking the big lobster open and dealing with all the gross guts inside is disgusting.
the other items on the seafood buffet are okay.  
dessert selection is alright.
i would look at other places to eat.
i wouldnt recommend eating here."}
{"text":"We used to love the Seafood Buffet at the Rio. Even the regular Carnival buffet was very good. Now they've combined them. Spectacularly disappointing. The surcharge you pay to have access to the additional seafood items is not worth it. The basic buffet has better crab legs. The food was over cooked, cold, dried out. Shall I continue? The only wine they serve is Naked (aka disgusting) brand.  Don't waste your money. There are many better options in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best buffet to eat Asian food. You heard me...ASIAN food. Hidden secret,  their roasted pork is to die for. The pork skin is crispy and the meat is tender and moist. That's my weakness..CRISPY pork skin...sooo yummy. You know how ppl go crazy over crispy bacon? I go crazy over roasted crispy pork skin hehe. Their roasted duck is delicious as well.  The duck skin has a slight crisp and the marinade for the duck is authentic, sweet and savory. I also like their selection of meat skewers. The teriyaki chicken and thai chicken skewers are delicious. Especially with the peanut dipping sauce. I didn't pay extra to eat in the seafood section,  but I gotta say their king crab legs are pretty decent, sweet and very large in size. Wasnt expecting that at all, based on the reviews about how their quality have gone down.  Their cocktail shrimp aren't peeled, but they're pretty decent size. At least they de-veined them. They also have a decent spread for salads which I really like and enjoy."}
{"text":"By far my favorite buffet in the \"buffet of buffet\" pass. We went here for dinner and the food area looked nice. The selection was huge. The Asian section was good. They can personalize ramen and have a Mongolian stir fry section. The sushi was a bit disappointing. The desserts had a huge selection, but not many were more than just average. 

My favorites included: fried and baked fish, arugula and best salad, orange chicken, 

Dislikes: prime rib had a few bites of great flavor, but the rest was blah. I wanted a tiny piece and he still cut me a huge slab. 

I tried small single bites of everything to see what was good and I still left this buffet stuffed. There is a big selection with all decent tasting food, nothing that will blow your mind, but something for the entire family."}
{"text":"Robert P. Was amazing! He's extremely friendly and helpful! Oh and the food is good too!"}
{"text":"A lot of food but the quality is lacking. The papaya salad is actually mango salad. Overall if you're looking for quality this is not the place. The dessert however is very very good love the creme brûlée"}
{"text":"This was the worst buffet i have ever been to. .   I really want to give them 0 stars"}
{"text":"This place got me sooo sick bad gas that I couldn't fart out  seriously the worst place ever."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't go here. If you're looking to eat lobster and snow crabs forget it. They stopped doing it. The lady who I talked to gave me an attitude when I asked and said \" they stopped doing that, it got too expensive the hotel couldn't afford it.\" And she left. For two people it was 65 bucks! We each ate 2 plates each and ate sorbet and left. Not worth it. I'm so disappointed in this experience. Never again.
Oh and not to mention, the food isn't all that great. Some chewy some over cooked some under cooked!!"}
{"text":"Honestly should have listened to the reviews.  Sunday brunch cost us about 70 dollars for two and although their selection is much larger than expected, the food lacks quality.   In short, this is the priciest \"Golden Corral\" I've ever been to.  
Our waiter Orlando was very friendly and took care of us.  He made this place better.  All in all we don't plan to return.  But thank you Orlando!!"}
{"text":"not too horrible, everything was fresh, if youre a picky eater id reccomend a different buffet. no deserts i could eat(i cant have chocolate) nothing was really remarkable except the prime rib which is good at any buffet and the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I use to be a 3-4 time a year Vegas visitor and this was always on my stop list.  It had been about 6 years and boy how this place has fallen so hard.  The 20$ upcharge to add on the Seafood is bad enough but to have every single item (about 12 total) be overcooked is disappointing at best.  The lobster seems to be the must have item and they are cooked beyond reason.  The rest of the world fair is mediocre at best.  This use to be a must recommend now it is a must avoid.  Buyer beware you do NOT get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill fast.

They recently bumped the price up (for seafood) from $48 to $55 (weekend). I was a little disappointed, but I figured if the food was better it would be worth it.

I was wrong. Not only did the quality not improve, but several of the best items were removed.

Lobster is no longer unlimited, instead you get a ticket for 1 lobster with the tiniest claws you will ever see.

King crab is gone, replaced with dungeness.

Blue crab is gone.

Sashimi is gone.

Fresh scallops are gone (although this happened a while ago).

The quality of this place was always noticeably lower than the top tier buffets around town, but there were a few standout seafood items that kept me coming back. 

Now that they're gone, I have zero reason to choose this place over the others. The price tag is absolutely not justified and the fact that a sizable price bump is tied to a much less impressive menu is insulting.

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not the best for seafood(if you're paying for the general buffet), but they have a very large selection of Asian food"}
{"text":"What on earth happened to the food quality? We've been coming here a two decades, food had always been good.   We recommended the buffet to people.  Came today on Saturday night and paid for the seafood upgrade, which was $34.99 plus $20 for the seafood upgrade.  You get unlimited seafood and one time lobster choice (whole lobster or tails).  There were crawfish, fish, crab and shrimp.  Everything tasted dry like it got reheated too many times.  Nothing was fresh, which is terrible for seafood.  Food on the main buffet area was lack luster.  Everything tasted so old and cold.  I will never come back or recommended this place especially for the price."}
{"text":"Disappointment is the first word that comes to mind when talking about this buffet. I'm only giving it a star because I have to or else I wouldn't even give it that. For $103 for 2 people for this buffet is a rip off. The quality of the food was horrible. Nothing had flavor everything was over cooked. To pay $15 extra for the seafood isn't even worth it. They didn't have anything amazing. I've heard so many great things about this buffet and it was a total let down. I was hoping the dessert would be the thing that saved this buffet but everything was either way to sweet (and I have a huge sweet tooth) or completely bland. The banana tart didn't even taste like banana, the flan tasted like cardboard, I was hoping the gelato wasn't too bad but they even messed up that. It tasted like perfume or like plain water. I will never be coming back here again. A complete waste of money, I would recommend going to a locals casino buffet before this one."}
{"text":"Similar to other reviews, the quality of this buffet has gone way way down. Food sitting for long periods of time, few customers as people have caught on, and the selections have been sliced in half. They should close this place down."}
{"text":"This is my parents absolute favorite buffet. They love everything about it for lunch and dinner. Today we tried it for breakfast. It was basically the same stuff as dinner with a few extra breakfast items. There was a small omelet station, with a long line, with only one person cooking. Then there was a tray of waffles, French toast, plain mushy hash browns, tator tots, and a big roll of eggs. I guess it was scrambled eggs, but they weren't really scrambled, just kinda rolled up in a log. Weird. There was some melon and some Danish rolls. There were no pancakes, or much variety in fruit, or crepes, or oatmeal, or breakfast muffins. For such a large buffet, I expected more options for breakfast."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre food if you ask me-there was nothing glamorous here.  Some of the food was reminiscent of something you would find at a golden corral or something.  This was my first buffet experience in Vegas, so I am hesitant to try others."}
{"text":"The crab legs gave me and my best friend food poisoning and ruined our last night in Vegas. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"PATHETIC!  I will include a copy of my bill at end of review. First of all at least a 30 minute wait on a Monday night. Then the buffet choices sucked! For the price of $32.99 a person for the regular buffet they are price gouging and should be ASHAMED of themselves! I've never been so disapointed with a large scale buffet in my life! Not one carving station nothing but frozen junk and carbs! The only lean meat option you get is a rubber chicken breast! Folks I could not even find butter for my dinner roll not even a green salad like WTH! Y'all are to cheap for lettuce? I have a bad taste in my mouth and have lost my appetite entirely for Rio I will NEVER COME BACK!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food is honestly so horrible, there's nothing to eat and the food doesn't seem fresh at all. Do not go here, there are so many better places than here."}
{"text":"This buffet is terrible. Don't fall for paying extra money for the seafood...most of the seafood is on the regular buffet. Quite honestly, you would be better off going to Golden Corral Buffet because the food here is the same quality but you pay 3 times the price. Gross."}
{"text":"Isn't the Rio hotel embarrassed by so many horrible reviews? This buffet is worth MAYBE 10.00 per person and that's being generous. We were there for Penn & Teller (They were terrific!), but this food could suck the magic out of Hogwarts. We spent 150 dollars for food that was worse than Denny's. Some of the food looked good, but lacked taste. As my father aptly put it, this is a glorified airport cafeteria with an insulting price. I had the worst seafood ever, followed by some Chinese food that was below take-out grade and then a slice of apple pie that would shame any supermarket into closing forever. We were unhappy enough with the food that we spent a LOT less on the gambling fun went elsewhere in the morning. That's how the Rio loses on this. You MUST get the food right or it's lost revenue. Serving poor food at high prices is a bad recipe for business and everyone in our party agreed. My wife and I won't bother with the Rio again on this issue alone. Do check out Penn & Teller, but eat somewhere else. The hotel itself is reasonable, but they need real help with the food."}
{"text":"Love this buffet. One of the best buffets I've ever been to. I really don't know why it doesn't have more stars. The seafood was amazing and the prime rib was the best buffet prime rib I've ever had. The sushi wasn't great but I still ate a ton of it. When you pay extra for the seafood portion they stamp your arm which you have to show to get into the seafood section of the buffet. The chilled shrimp were HUGE!!! And they had tuna and salmon sashimi. There was even lobster tails and claws (didn't look very good) but still had the biggest line out of all the food. Will definitely come back every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here for so many times previously and just love the seafood buffet here at Rio. Also stayed here pretty often when coming to Vegas each every years. buffet price was around $40- $50 per person. lots of selections and tons of varieties. foods are amazingly good. can't wait to be back here once again soon."}
{"text":"This buffet restaurant is inside of the Rio Hotel & Casino. I had not been here in years and thought I'd take my parents and my nieces this past Sunday since were in town. WOW! The prices have skyrocketed from my last time here. Don't even think of asking for the seafood buffet because they add an additional  $20 I believe per person and their selection is very limited and not the best. I paid over $30 per kid and per adult and it was a total of 5 of us. 

We just ordered the regular buffet and not the added seafood buffet area. Glad I didn't pay that extra because it was not worth it. The buffet has honestly gone down. Our buffet options were certainly not worth the over $30 per person and certainly not for kids. The service from the waiters doing the cleaning and picking up the tables was good. My only complaint about that is that some of the staff would stand around and complaint to each other about other staff members or customers. That's not good customer service and nor was it the time or place to make those complaints or comments in front of customers. 

Other than that the buffet was simply okay. I may go back but it will certainly be a long time before that happens. The quality of the food was not great."}
{"text":"Went Sunday night buffet $35 per person. $15 for child 5 years older pay. 4 younger free. Didn't try sea food but they have option to up charge if u like that and bottom less drink up charge for $15 more. So it can get pricey. Loved the prime rib!! Lots of selection. Pasta, pizza, & French fries kid friendly food. Apple juice available. Lots of desert options! Staff was very nice. Only thing did not like was the wait time. Got in line at 7:30 did not get seated till 8:20 (on a Sunday night!). By the time we had our food together they announced over the intercom 40 min left before closing. Gee!! Ever eat fast at a buffet!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with new buffet combined.  We have been coming here for years and will not come back.  used to be my go to every time we visit."}
{"text":"This is probably the only buffet I could ever eat at. I am a clean freak and every time I've been at a buffet, I usually am grossed out and have no appetite to eat what's so ever. But when I walk in this buffet, it is so clean and the food is amazing !!! I usually love the desserts there along with all their other food ! I cannot wait to go back to Vegas just to eat at that buffet. It is my favorite place to eat at."}
{"text":"This and the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood, are my two favorite buffets in Vegas, not because they are the highest end, but because they provide consistently good food and a fabulous variety.

As the name implies, this buffet presents a great variety of dishes from all over the world (over 300, Italian, American, Mexican, Asian, Chinese, Sushi, Vegetarian Friendly, Gluten Free Options), with a great selection of seafood as well ($20. upgrade to get all of the seafood - you can get away with just having one person in your group get this, and then supply your table).

Dinners are $32.99 (M - Th, 3 - 10pm), $34.99 (F - Su, same hours), not including the seafood upgrade.  M - F lunch, 11am - 3pm, $24.99  (Locals get a discount - show your ID.)

Some reviews state that the buffet has gone down hill, but each time I've been there it has been fine."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with our visit. The line to get in was so long for no reason. The system needs improvement. For the price we paid, we expected more in terms of busing the tables. We had a pile of cups stacked & the finished table next to us sat dirty for too long. The quality of food was that of a very cheap buffet. We expected more quality items, more variety and better cuts of meat. The lettuce was witty, the pizza Chuck E. Cheese quality & the seafood mediocre."}
{"text":"Once it was my favorite place to have dinner. After today, I don't think I'll never visit this place NEVER. No wonder there is no line to get in. Serving 4 small half lobster tails per person. Seriously? No many fresh crab legs!!!!No sushi or sashimi!!!!!!!!!! Is Rio going out of business soon? Totally radiculus........"}
{"text":"This is the must eat buffet in Vegas...the food was great but the service was even better! Despite it being Thanksgiving weekend and tourist and locals choosing to not eat any left overs this place had the best service thanks to TOM! He welcomed us as soon as we were seated and promptly took our drink order (coffee & mimosas). But instead of just bringing one round of mimosas, he brought us the second round earlier. Our glasses were never empty, if we left to get more food or the restroom (to make room for more food), when we came back those glasses were full. 

Our table never got crowded with finished plates or trash. Tom was very prompt and courtesy with all of us and he could tell we were hungover. He over heard my friend talk about crab legs the entire time we were eating, but they were not available when we were currently grabbing plates of food. When my friend stepped out to make a call, without even asking Tom came and brought 3 plates of crab legs and placed them on our table. 

I work in the tourism industry in employee & guest services and this was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever experienced. If only there were more people like Tom in this world. 

Thank you Tom for this wonderful experience. I hope the next time I visit, you are there again."}
{"text":"Best experience. Manager in grey suit was so nice and helpful. Definitely coming back next time. Excellent service !!"}
{"text":"This place is ok if it was priced $9.99. Food was too salty, odd flavor, and was overall gross. It was very expensive for below average food. Soft drink tower is touch screen, same spot as everyone else has touched their hands and fingers to. (Gross) Felt ehhh after leaving this place. Save your money and try something else."}
{"text":"Oh have times changed! Rio used to have two buffets, but they are now combined to create the Carnival buffet.  This used to be my families favorite buffet in Vegas, but it has sadly moved out of the top 5.  Overall, good food and generally a good presentation, excellent variety and the food tasted good .  The main reason for the lower than 4 star rating is the price of the buffet: paying $35 including tax for a buffet is rather costly.  It really has to exceed standards to make it worth that much money."}
{"text":"I have been there twice in the last few months while in Vegas and both times it was wonderful.  I always go with the seafood add-on and it's worth it. I like the fact now that it is one huge buffet instead of two smaller and weaker ones. I remember the glory days in the late 90's when this buffet was incredible. And I also remember the times just a few years ago where this buffet was over priced and over rated. Right now I consider it one of the top three buffets in Vegas and a \"must stop\" on any major trip there. The food is excellent and the choices now are extreme. Other than some of the fish being a bit over cooked, it was stunning. But what sets it apart is the service. (For a buffet!) The dining location  is comfortable and elegant. But the personal service I got was wonderful. I saw the same male server there each time. (a tall thin white gentleman in his 40's I would guess) and he made my party feel welcome and very well cared for. I am planning to go back there this summer and I am also planning to go there during my company's thank you vacation this coming December. All in all a great place to spend some time and one of the few reasons to visit the Rio."}
{"text":"After reading some of the negative reviews I was pretty worried about eating here. We went for brunch on Sunday and was lucky enough to be seated in Roberts section. Service was amazing and he makes the best mimosa's! I called them the Robert. It's a mix of delicious pineapple juice with orange juice and of course Champagne. The food was pretty fresh and a variety of choices. But it was really Robert who made the experience as our drinks were always full and plates cleared immediately. You don't typically get service like this at a buffet."}
{"text":"The seafood buffet is absolutely amazing... make sure you go at 3pm to enjoy the all you can eat lobster, crab, and shrimp... besides the food the manager DJ is so entertaining, very nice and takes good care of his customers... John the bartender made my mimosa just the way I like it and who is also very nice.. Londy the seafood host was also so sweet..  I will come back for the food and to visit DJ... Excellent Staff... see you next time"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Vegas. Rio has been my number 1 spot for great customer service and food for many years. Roberto in the VIP area was absolutely amazing. Roberto is attentive and made sure we were taken care of. I have recommended the carnival buffet to all my out of state and locals friends and family. Many were able to request Roberto and have had great experiences. Roberto delivers above and beyond customer service. Thank you Roberto! See you next time."}
{"text":"This was the most overpriced and underwhelming dining experience of my entire life. The food choices are wide but nothing is really very appetizing. If you want to spend $40 on a meal you should spend it on something that is actually enjoyable to eat. We were able to get a refund on one of our meals since I barely ate anything and what I did eat made me feel sick. 

Overall, this is essentially what you could expect for an Old Country Buffet on a bad day for twice the price."}
{"text":"I was rather disappointed in the limited selection of seafood. :( initially they sat me way opposite, very far from the the seafood section and then I had to request to sit close to the seafood section. I don't know why they did that as it was a weekday and just 4:30pm for dinner there was barely anyone there. Seafood I felt that nothing was fresh.  The raw oysters looked scary, like a really bad stomach ache with diarrhea waiting to happen. I was very much looking forward to seafood and in particularly choose Rio because it's seafood buffet. Sadly, I don't think I would return again."}
{"text":"Please do not go to this buffet thinking that it is the old seafood buffet with station after station of seafood. The seafood section is tiny and the quality is questionable. The crab was either over cooked or sat out all day under the heat lamps. The shrimp scampi and Chinese station were my favorites, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"The seafood buffet was really disappointing! Not as good as it used to be AND they charged us an extra $20 on our credit card for a \"tip\" even though our receipt did not have gratuity on it and we left a cash tip instead. Total BS considering all the servers do is clean the table they don't serve you anything, beverages and the bar are self serve. WE WILL BE CALLING IN THE MORNING!! My mom used to go here for the seafood buffet years ago and raved about it, it was literally the #1 thing she was looking forward to on this trip so she took me here as a treat. She even went a year and a half ago and according to her they have raised the price since then and lowered the food quality. Used to have king crab but now they serve low quality crab which had no flavor and hardly had any meat. Lobster tails were cut up, dried out, and tough. No longer serve giant prawns. Bland cocktail shrimp. Sushi was good though. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is a Great Buffet has a huge selection and the food is very good. If you like chile verde chile verde is out of this world. Although it's not my favorite Caesars Buffet it is very very good I like the Paris Buffet a bit better and of course the Caesars Palace buffet is incredible but Caesars is quite a bit more."}
{"text":"Selection of food was pretty good, they even boil the noodle soups in front of you. I'd suggest the Phõ. The cook will serve it plain, but they have chicken, beef and greens to add flavor to it."}
{"text":"The first 2 times my family and I ate here from the seafood side to the regular buffet all food was actually FRESH, the waitress actually cleared our tables & the customer service was decent! 

The desert section is about the only section worth going to. A lot of options and very tasty! That is all tho! The rest... Don't know what happened but it's definitely NOT worth the $ to eat here!! 

Took our waitress forever to clean our tables! The food tasted like it's just been sitting there for the last day or so. Just not worth it!!"}
{"text":"Not the best buffet in Vegas. It's decent. The buffet is huge and offers a variety of food. 
They don't offer military discount like the Cosmopolitan. It's $35 for the regular buffet and $50 for the seafood buffet. I didn't think the seafood selection was worth $50. I wouldn't spend the extra money on it. Especially because the regular buffet offers a nice seafood selection. 
The dessert section wasn't big but it was delicious. 
Overall, it was just ok."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst buffet I've ever been to. I was here a year ago and decided to come back.

They charge an extra $20-25 for seafood on top of the $30+ you have to pay for regular brunch/dinner. The seafood isn't worth it and the food selection is close to garbage. 

They have a ton of carbs and starches to get you full and out of here in no time (potatoes, crappy noodles, four different types of rice). The soup options were drenched in oil and noodles were  swimming in a pool of soy sauce.

Dessert is the same from last year as well...you're better off choosing a different buffet to get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"This place is a great buffet for reasonable price on the strip. Their desserts are fantastic and they have a great mix of food. Even if you do not have the seafood add-on then you can still get some seafood, though the salmon looked dry. The alcohol add on is super cheap and unlimited which is fantastic."}
{"text":"The primary buffet was decent, nice selection of food and what we tried was flavorful and hot. But we went there, and paid extra for, the seafood side of the buffet. HUGE mistake. It was without a doubt the worst seafood I have ever had. With the exception of the steamed crab legs (which were very good) nothing was particularly hot, all of it was way overcooked and most didn't taste especialy fresh."}
{"text":"My first time here at this amazing buffet in Vegas!! The seafood side is worth the extra cost and our waiter (Rob) was great  all you can eat n drink  !!!"}
{"text":"CRAB WARNING.  If you're planning on snow or king crab for $30.99 think again.  It's no longer offered for the standard price, you'll have to do the $20 upgrade.   In it's place is the disappointly small \"rock crab\", which is so tiny it's not worth your time.  It was like I was being punished for not spending the extra $20.  

So to get snow crab, and other seafood offerings (including a lobster tail, to be fair) you'll pay the weekday price of $55.07 and a whopping $60.47 on the weekends. 

Aside from the seafood, their other options were subpar and overall not recommended.  I did like their soup station which included various Asian soups including Pho, Udon, and Wonton.

For the money, go to Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon, or Wynn."}
{"text":"This place gave us food poisoning!!!! Thanks for ruining our anniversary!!!! The food was bland and half the lobster was not even lobster, it was not fully cooked and the oysters where bad!!! (We did not eat them you could smell that they where rotten). The food choices where bad I can get a hard shell taco anywhere and that's not even from another country that's American I thought this buffet was food from around the world?? The seafood buffet was not worth it at all it all look bad like the rejected food from Golden corral!!! And the dessert bar was just cream put in fancy plastic cups with different toppings, and the gelato was not even gelato it was the worst I have ever had. I watched as they would take what was left that had been sitting for awhile dump into another bowl and put back out again, I think this practice is what gave us food poisoning by mixing old food that has been sitting out past it's time and bacteria grew and passed to a new food and keep going. Do your body a favor and don't go, what a waste of a trip! food poison on the first night."}
{"text":"Carnival World inside the Rio used to be one of the best buffet in the City of Las Vegas. After visiting this buffet last Monday night for dinner, it wasn't as great as it used to.

It was an dinner for 2, $32.99 each, with seafood option, it was $51. We didn't bother with the seafood option since it was too expensive.

Here's what food I've tried for dinner.

Let start with the pork loin, it was dry. In fact, I didn't actually like any of the pork items in this buffet. I tried the prime rib, which I had twice actually, it was very delicious. I've tried some other stuff. Most of the other stuff was very good. However, I didn't like Mac and Cheese (lack of flavor). Then I had gelato for dessert. it wasn't too bad. Not much else to say about it.

They do have seafood option like I mentioned. Even though I didn't get the seafood buffet, I'll say it's not worth getting. 

Overall.... there were some hit and miss at this place. This place is going downhill. Not very please. Very likely I will not be eating here again anytime soon. There's other buffets in Vegas what's worth trying.  2.5 stars at this one sounds about right to me which is 3 stars to me.

{"text":"I remember coming to the Rio World Buffet as a little kid and back then I thought it was the best thing a food loving kid could ever dream of. Fast forward some years and things have definitely changed. Not only have my taste buds matured but my love and appreciation for good food has blossomed and I am some what of a food snob and will turn up my nose to stank food. Unfortunately, the Rio World Buffet got the stank face. The food here, although abundant and they have a great variety of choices, is subpar and some of it looked downright dangerous. I upgraded to have access to the seafood buffet but 90% of the seafood dishes I wouldn't touch out of fear of  food poisoning. The only saving grace at this establishment was the gelato bar where I had the green tea gelato and mango sorbet. It was so refreshing after eyeball rolling all the heavy food. Besides this sweet treat, the salad I made and the crawfish were the only things I enjoyed during my dining experience. Thanks for the childhood memories but I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's not worth the money.. I paid around $55 per person with seafood option... they give you one lobster per person.  Lobster was so dried, I had one bite...  not much of option for extra $20.. save that $20 please!  Now for $35 buffet, it's really not that bad..  they have meat section, oriental section, bit of seafood section, and dessert section..  every single sections lacks quality..  it's not total waste of $35 for only regular buffet but I will not visit here again."}
{"text":"Save your money. Don't let the lobster buffet fool you. It's not worth it.  Yes they do serve lobsters, but it's not worth it.  The lobster tail are so small. Knowing that it's small, they still cut it in half.  You pretty much you get nothing out of it when trying to eat it.  They barely have any Maine lobster. I'd say 70 percent were these weird unknown lobster tail mix with 30 percent Maine lobster. So many people in line getting the lobster.  By the time it's your turn to dig in,  the Maine lobster are already gone.  You get the weird looking lobster tail. I spend over 100 for 2 people. Not worth it at all.  I rather go eat somewhere fancy for that price."}
{"text":"Such an underwhelming experience, food was bland and the Chinese food was some of the worst I've ever had. At 32.99 for the regular buffet I had high hopes but they just fell completely short. Also the soda machine just made me want to wash my hands after every refill. This is a $12 buffet at best."}
{"text":"There is no longer the seafood portion of the buffet. No crablegs and no lobster. It was removed before May 22nd 2018."}
{"text":"When the Rio combined its separate buffets, my wife and I stopped going to the old seafood buffet which we both loved. Months later during a stay at the Rio we decided to try the combined buffet -- didn't want to leave the hotel for dinner elsewhere. The seafood is far superior and more bountiful than the old seafood buffet. I was really shocked. If you like seafood, try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here before, but the food is not how I remember at all. My brother-in-law and his friend opted for the more expensive option so they could visit the seafood area. However, the other side also had some seafood options. 

They food itself was kind of cold. I had 2 rounds, but my plate was not very full each time. My husband's family did like the prime rib though which I didin't get.  All in all, very disappointing. I moved onto dessert, and tried a cookie, creme brulee, flan, cheesecake, and gelato. Again, kind of disappointing. The gelato wasn't thick and creamy, but rather a bit icy. The creme brulee was decent, but they should have torched the top some more for that sugar crust.

I don't think I'll be back here again. We had a party of 6 and all of us felt the same way. We only came here out of tradition, but if we were to come back...no more buffets for me.

The reason I'm giving 2 stars is because our server was very good. She was on top of things - clearing plates and making sure our cups were never empty.

{"text":"The buffet is split in two sections. The first is your general buffet. The second includes the general buffet as well as the seafood buffet. Don't bother with the seafood buffet. It costs $52 and there isn't really anything special about it. The fish was overcooked and the lobster was like a rubber band in your mouth. The general buffet section was $39 and had the typical selections you'd expect. It was edible, to say the least. There were a few things that were decent here and there, so it wasn't totally bad. I did enjoy the coconut gelato. Overall, though, you're better off going somewhere else that's cheaper."}
{"text":"Went at 8pm thinking I had plenty of time, but the line was huge! It took around 2 hours to get seated and at that point we had one hour to eat before they closed all the food. The food was horrible the food was not fresh and was very bad. Not worth the wait. Fried foods were not very good. If you like ribs though, they were good. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Up until 10 years ago I came to Las Vegas every year for a conference and the Rio buffet was always a regular stop. However this year's visit revealed that those were the Rio's Glory Days long past. My meal there today was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had at a restaurant in Las Vegas. I suppose the sewer smell as I drove up to the building should have been a clue that they haven't quite maintained the Rio. A second warning should have been the fact that there was no wait to get in. In years past there's always been a line. Not today. As I was paying the cashier asked if I wanted Seafood. I found that an odd question since it's a seafood buffet but I said yes. That's when I got my worst shock of day. The price has shot up  to almost $60/person. As they were seating me they mentioned that they were closing in 45 minutes - hint hint. Needless to say very few items on the buffet were hot or fresh. They initially mentioned that the seafood buffet now has Lobster which it didn't used to have. That briefly removed the sting of the cost until they clarified that you only get one. They actually give you a ticket for your single lonely Lobster. It was medium warm but tough. In fact only thing on the entire buffet that was up to their former gold standard was the crab legs. But that certainly didn't make up for the $60 price tag. I wish I knew what happened to the Rio. Every year that I went long ago, the place was packed and the food was delicious. Now the place smells, there are no lines and the food is galactically disappointing. I definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Let me just say the first time coming to this buffet really had me impressed and the service was good. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for my second go round here. First of all, we are there celebrating my friend's brother birthday. We get there and they let us know what the price is per person so we get the amount and for 8 people it is $308 roughly. Not a problem because we were well aware of the price prior to entrance. So as we are waiting to get seated we are standing there for a good 5 minutes before the cashier radio's someone and let's them know that we are waiting to be seated. At the time they did not have a table available for 8 allegedly but they sat a family of 7 people who entered after us and paid after us at a table. Still no complaints from myself or anyone in my party. We then tell the associate that we can separate and do 4 at each table because we were tired of waiting but we would like the tables together right next to each other. I'm not sure what part of that was unclear but when another associate flagged us down there was only ONE table for 4 people and when we asked her if she had another table she looked at us with a look of disgust and said \"no.\" Okay? Still no problem we go back up to the front and the lady asked us to wait yet again because there is no table. Finally after about 15 minutes they find a table for us and we are seated. The entire time we are sitting at the table we have multiple workers watching our table like they are security and we are some prisoners in their establishment. What was odd was they did not do this to anyone else in the buffet only myself and the people I was with. As a group of Black males and females you can understand why this may be disturbing because we literally felt like we were being racially profiled especially since the service we received wasn't the greatest. Everyone else outside of us were being accommodated with no issues. I actually liked this buffet because the large selection of food but after being racially profiled and being treated the way we were you can bet your bottom dollar that I won't give them one red cent of my money again which is sad but I'm sure there are plenty other buffets we can enjoy with much better service and appreciation for customers no matter their skin color."}
{"text":"Of all the buffets we have been to in Las Vegas this is one of the worst. The atmosphere is drab and the food is mediocre. This hotel is far out of the way of the strip- unless you're staying here I wouldn't make the special trip."}
{"text":"The food here was a bit underwhelming for me considering I paid ~$40 for it. The line just to get in was pretty long, around a 20 minute wait on a Saturday night. My group and I finally got a table after what seemed like forever and 2 groups, since we didn't want to be split and therefore they had other groups go in front of us. I recommend coming a little earlier just to make sure you aren't hangry like I was. 

Anyways, it was hard to even get a server since the place was kinda busy so we didn't get our drinks till later. As well, they didn't have an open bar!!! Meh, Studio B did. Also, I love seafood and was not thrilled to find out you had to pay more in order to get some. The only thing I kinda liked was popcorn shrimp which was good, but other than that everything was pretty normal. I got some sushi just to see how it would be like but it seemed like it was on the plate for the whole day. They also have a soup section which I liked, but it could only go so far. I got vietnamese pho and it was aight.

I ended up not eating my weight for the amount I paid for which was a little disappointing. My friends felt the same way and so we weren't that impressed with the buffet as we would for Studio B. Honestly, for the same amount I paid, I would've rather'd make the drive over to Studio B than go here."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I came in at 4pm. All hot food except thick soup and made-to-order items GET COLD REALLY FAST when I'm ready to eat on the table. The A/C isn't even that strong. Their food heating is definitely a problem."}
{"text":"We were staying at Rio with $25dining and $30(waived the cleaning), we ended up eating here for dinner... we did not do the upgrade since we are disappointed the seafood quality at other hotel... but it was a bad choice. We definitely gonna upgrade it if we are coming back again."}
{"text":"I was told that the next time I was in Vegas, I should try the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio.  They said that it was the biggest, and one of the best buffets in Vegas.  Now, I'm a sucker for a good buffet, so I trekked off the strip on my first night to give it a try.

The first issue I had was that once I got there I found out that there are two entrances and two prices!  One entry is for the main buffet and the other is for the \"seafood\" buffet.  If you pay the higher price for the seafood buffet, you get a stamp on your hand that gives you access to a separate section in which extra seafood items are available.  That is fine, but I don't think it was at all clear from the entrances.  When I arrived, the first entrance I encountered was for the seafood buffet, and there was a long line.  Since I hadn't even heard that there was a seafood buffet, I was very confused.  Fortunately, I walked further on and found the entrance to the main buffet.  No line.  So I paid there.  Now I knew that they wouldn't want to miss an opportunity to sell more, so I bought the \"upgrade\" to the seafood buffet from the main buffet entry point.

Don't get me wrong.  There were lots of choices for food - maybe too many.  And the staff were nice enough.  The problem I had was how wildly the quality of the food varied.   Shrimp, good.  Lobster, dry and over-cooked and tiny.  Salad, good. Some of the Asian options had been out way too long and seemed to have a film on top.

In the end I certainly had enough to eat, but there were enough items I tried that were sub-par in my opinion that the overall experience was not stellar.  I'd go to the Bellagio buffet instead any day."}
{"text":"Not only has the food quality gone downhill but the service is even worse. Came to the Rio because of its reputation as having one of the best buffets. Aside from the poor quality, we received the worse service before we even sat down. We asked for a Mimosa from the front desk and our server just to get snapped at. Then our server ignored us pretty much the whole time. After asking for the manager to complain she had the nerve to tell the manager that we cussed her out. In the end, they called security on us as we were leaving haha. We got to say our peace to the manager but I believe it was the servers plan to get us thrown out after she knew she provided some horrible service and place the blame on us. Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"Meh, not worth $49.99. Came here around 8:30PM on a Sunday. No line, plenty of tables, and not too busy. Besides the crab legs, there's really nothing that was even above average to my taste buds. The salmon and halibut were overcooked, pastas were bland and everything has a strange plastic layer that you must disturb to get to.  

Everything just looks like it's been sitting out for hours, even when they just bring it out. The soups were just... scary. 

The gelato was good. Service was good. The food was just disappointing. I've had tv dinners that tasted better.

So sad. I wouldn't recommend this buffet at all."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since I've been here years ago. We stayed here for a quick overnighter on the way to San Diego. Went on booking.com to reserve our room. It was $29/night + $32/night resort fee. I thought it was still a good deal. Our check in was pretty quick. Our room was on the 14th floor. We arrived on our floor and as we are walking down the hallway, every sconce lampshade in the hallway was either busted, torn or completely off of the sconces. It felt low budget and trashy. We always stay at the Marriott. I'll never do this again. It gave the feel that the Rio took no pride on customer's \"first impressions\"  of their hotel. We ate at the Pho restaurant downstairs casino last night, the online ads stated the pho dishes were around $13/dish, we learned the prices were between $15-&18. The food was 5/10 at best! So disappointing. I was here years ago, and this place felt magical! Current management totally missed the mark today! Probably won't stay here again, so sad."}
{"text":"I've been here twice , first time was really good second time it was alright. The buffet is on the pricey side , which was a disappointment considering the food was not worth it."}
{"text":"It was once my favorite place to eat in Vegas...now it's an overpriced cafeteria with average food and horrible service."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Payed the extra $20 for seafood.. Not worth it!! Stood in line for 30 minutes for the seafood section and the lobster was fishy and soggy! Everything else was cold and tasteless.. Do not go to this buffet!"}
{"text":"We went here because we were going to see Penn & Teller, and were told this was the best buffet in Vegas. We were surprised to find very poor quality for the high price.  Seafood not worth the extra $$$.  Everything was pretty low quality.  Trays were not maintained well and food was poorly presented - shells in everything, pieces of food piled up on one another, which was unappetizing. Sushi was poorly rolled, tasted awful. More than once had to spit the food into our napkins. Very confused as to why this was so highly rated.  After great meals the entire trip, this was a disappointing end to our Vegas experience. Your money is better spent at a nice sit down experience."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a big buffet, beats all the others for sure, just have to make sure your hungry because what you pay you should eat your full for sure. I dont think I have ever been to a buffet that requires a stamped hand to get into a section of the buffet (seafood part) I do think it was very good and worth the money, not a place to go all the time but sometimes and with friends also. They have a good section of food and hot ready to eat, the workers seem to make sure the food is well kept and clean areas. I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"After years of this buffet falling short on their previos greatness, we went this weekend.  All the food was very good.  The Chinese food was some of the best buffet Chinese food I have had.  The prime rib was very good.  The desserts were awesome.  Very good experience."}
{"text":"Ok, We broke down and tried the seafood buffet.  To say that it was good would be a lie,  it was mediocre and that is pushing it.  I was told they had lobster tails, well they did but the were all chopped up in some nasty sauce and they were so salty I could not eat them.   As far as the Carnival World Buffet it was alright, we have experienced way better.  The prime rib was good that is the only reason for the 2 stars. On the Carnival World buffet there was plenty of seafood, crab legs, shrimp, sushi, and fish.   As far as over 70 homemade pies and desserts, someone can not count.  might have been 30 max.  And there was no chocolate cake.  Should bump it down to 1 star.  $103 for 2 people with out cocktails."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Most of the food was warm, not hot. Tasted really prepared for the mass's. Meat selection were over cooked. Save your money and Uber somewhere else."}
{"text":"I suppose this place might be worth while if you eat meat. I however do not and the meatless selections were sparse and generally subpar. You know it's not a good selection when you can't even get a meatless pasta dish (and I'm not counting the Mac and cheese as a pasta dish). The only things that were good were the veggie pad Thai and the Nachos. Even the desserts weren't that good. The Gelato tasted very artificial. The creme brulee was the only good thing on the dessert bar. My friends all opted for the seafood add on which they all raved about. One day maybe I'll learn my lesson and stop going to buffets with my friends. I definitely did not eat $35 worth of food, but it's slightly better than the $50 you pay at many of the other buffets on the strip."}
{"text":"After a cold swim at Treasure Island, my family and I were starving, looking for a place to fill us up for the rest of the night. My aunt decided that we go eat dinner at Rio's Carnival World & Seafood Buffet. Now let me get started why this was a 1/5 stars rating. 

As we were driving from Treasure Island to Rio, self parking was just so difficult to find. We found ourselves in the employees only parking twice, however after about five minutes, we found it. It was a sketchy looking building and it didn't look like a parking lot at all. 

While we were waiting in line, we were greeted with smiles by the cashiers. For adult admission is around $33 and if you want to eat seafood, it's an additional $20 which is not worth at all considering that the regular buffet didn't satisfy my taste buds at all. And it doesn't make sense to separate the seafood section from the regular buffet. There is a large selection of food from asian, mexican, italian, and your traditional american cuisine. Although there were many dishes to choose from, they were all horribly made. Don't get me started on the sushi section, everything they served all tasted sour which obviously isn't suppose to taste like that. At first I thought it was the mayo inside the rice but it couldn't have been, it was the tempura! My other cousin got a whole array of sushi and she said they all tasted sour. In addition, there is a build your own noodle bar with different types of noodles such as udon, ramen, pho, etc... Let me tell you, do NOT get the pork miso ramen because it is nothing close to the actual pork miso ramen you can get. I despite leaving food on my plate yet I can't make myself eat food that had no flavor or taste at all. 

Now let me tell you that there is a dessert bar smack dab right in the middle of the buffet. Since I have a major sweet tooth, I was extremely excited to try everything and I was highly disappointed in everything I ate. From the flan to the crume brûlée to the fruit tart, and everything else was horrible. It was displeasing to the tongue. If anything, the only good dessert they served was the gelato, but don't get the mango. It was nothing close to a mango flavor, it had a more bitter taste to it. 

If anything, the only cool thing about this buffet was the self serve beverage station. However, the screen was dirty. In the end, it did make me full but I was discontented the entire time. Think hard and deep before deciding to come here.

{"text":"Let me just start off by saying Wally was so attentive and very personable. Mac and cheese was so good seafood was to die for dungeness crab was super fresh too. Only thing is you have to pay an extea $25 for seafood pass. But it's worth it if you like seafood like that."}
{"text":"This probably was one of my favorite buffet of all time. This time, however has been very disappointing for our family. We came excited to feast as it's been years since we all came to Vegas all together. Prime Rib is now replaced with what seem to be london broil, nasty and tough. There wasn't even a name sign. Snow Crab is all gone and moved to the higher seafood section and need to pay addition of $20 and in exhange is replaced baby rock crab. Kabobs, were no where to be found.  The price went up ($32.99) M to T Dinner and buffet downgraded to low quality food. Which is not right that no one tells you up front before you pay. I was here at the end of February and they still had Snow Crab and Prime Rib! So for the management to straight lie to my Dad's face and said the changes has been a year. This is dishonestly. We're so upset that we will never step food in Rio Carnival Buffet ever again!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of food paired with the rate of pricing makes this destination an extreme disappointment. The lack of care for the various stations was evident in our visit. The carving meats were all extremely salty, sushi options were quite limited, and the pho (Vietnamese soup) station - my favorite meal, normally - soured my mood. The various meats/balls and soup additions appeared to not be taken care of... at minimum, one would expect a staff member to periodically mix the food. The food on the surface was dried out entirely and did not look appetizing. I was bummed, but wrote off the experience with having had the \"all-you-can-eat las vegas experience.\" Would not recommend or revisit."}
{"text":"We would always look forward to coming to the Rio for their hospitality and buffet, but i guess its been awhile since we been to Vegas. The buffet at the Rio was at one time the \"go to buffet\" in Vegas. No more for sure! The Rio was our goto spot! Unfortunately I don't think we will ever go back. The buffet price was $35 per person with a $20 up-charge for seafood?!? Come on! And to boot, if you pay the up-charge you can only get one lobster?!? For $55 dollars per person, we definitely could find a better seafood buffet. 
This trip we opted for just the regular buffet which at best was mediocre. And to pour salt on us, they seated us next to the seafood buffet portion, really?!? 
I don't know... we really loved the Rio and the old buffet but the quality and value has gone downhill so i guess it's time to move on... We will keep the fond memories of this hotel but doubt we will ever \"make it a point\" to go back to, for either the hotel or the food. I'll keep reading reviews of this place hoping it gets better so we can one day come back."}
{"text":"This was once a very good buffet. Decided to try it again tonight. All I can say is WOW! It has really gone down hill. The food was just horrible, and we tried a variety of different things. If you want seafood, you have to pay an extra 20 dollars on top of the regular price. The seafood was not fresh and some was not fully cooked. Yikes! I hope none of us gets sick. There are too many other buffets to choose in Las Vegas. Do yourself a huge favor and pick a different one."}
{"text":"Caesars Entertainment Corporation are running this place into the ground, likely before selling it, such a disgrace.  Anyone who remembers this place in the glory days would recall the best buffet in Vegas.  It's a complete disaster now, don't eat here.

What a shame.  The signature carnival show doesn't run anymore because \"they would have to spend money to make it work\" said an employee.

The biggest joke is the RESORT FEE!  What the hell are they spending it on? not the \"resort\" that's for sure, lining Caesars pockets.  

We knew saying here was a long shot, but I still wasn't ready for the crapmosphere here.

RUN!"}
{"text":"Not what used to be---- nor presentations or taste to rave about.  The extra charge for the seafood is total no needed extra expense save your money as half of the dishes are already present at the \"lesser\" expensive side of the restaurant ( btw not so cheap )...
It's the version of a strip mall Chinese buffet for more money and tasteless. You serve yourself the drinks too so you and the other guests are in constant move and the food gets cold."}
{"text":"Many, many years ago before they remolded this place, it was good and not so many buffets around, but now, the line was almost 2 hours long and the food was so bad, I was very sick the next day.
 However, one time I went there right when they opened and I was the first one in before the crowd. That was a good experience.
The seafood buffet was well worth the money and people actually dressed up to go in there. My friends would rant and rave about the seafood buffet."}
{"text":"Use a Groupon!!! that is the very first thing I can tell you each because  that the only way I can say its somewhat worth it... The food was ok but nothing amazing, and the extra cost for the seafood buffet isnt worth it."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. Very glad I took the tip. Got there Friday at 6:30 maybe 10 in line ahead of our party of 5. 15 minutes and we were seated. Great server got our empty plates removed and filled our requests for drinks, napkins etc.

Found plenty of fresh delicious sea food.  Best clam chowder with a hint of hot spice. Loved the Asian section also."}
{"text":"I opted for the Seafood, BAD MOVE  DUDE!!!  vERY mEDIOCRe. the crab was small and had little meat, the oysters were so frozen they had ice in them, lobster was very bland and small. The prime rib was super dry. The ambience was like a place that was on it's last leg. The staff was nothing special. This used to be one of my favorite buffets in Vegas years ago but the quality has just gone way down. This place has \"Jumped the Shark\""}
{"text":"BEST BUFFET in Vegas, hands down! A bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The Carnival world buffet was pretty good. We paid extra for the extra seafood buffet only to find out that it really didn't have much more to offer. the \"lobster pieces\" were ridiculous. They offered crab legs and other seafood at the standard buffet. also being from Maryland, I wasn't impressed by the NO SEASONING on the seafood. if I went again I'd pay $20 less for the regular buffet. Seafood aside, the rest of the buffet was awesome. Lots to choose from. Tacos delicious!"}
