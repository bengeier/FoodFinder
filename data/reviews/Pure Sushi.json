{"text":"hip place, great food.  nice decor."}
{"text":"Amazing food, cocktails and service. Brian at the bar made our service one of a kind and was very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The place is nice, good atmosphere and such. Now the food... Well, I've had better sushi, especially for the prices they were charging. The drinks were all right, but once again, they were a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good sushi place since we moved from California in September...and we finally found it! We live in Glendale so it's not too close to our house but when we are craving sushi, we will be making the drive for this place.. The atmosphere and food is great and the service is even better! The owner greeted us when we sat down and the server was amazing! You can tell they focus on keeping their customers happy. We went crazy on the happy hour and enjoyed everything we ordered! Well done!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and was impressed with the quality if the sushi which was during happy hour. My husband has baked sea bass and he enjoyed the meal. The service was friendly and quick and we had a pleasant evening. I would recommend this place and hope to return before I leave Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really good happy hour specials and hours considering they offer the menu on the weekends from 11-6. The calamari was crispy and fresh with an Asian style pesto sauce which was different but delicious. We got three rolls: Philly, Pure Crunch and Pure Fire Dragon. Each was dirt cheap on happy hour but tasted far from cheap. The Philly was pretty standard except it had some nice sized chunks of fresh tuna. The Crunch had a tasty eel sauce and of course a crunchy exterior that was really yummy too. For me, the Fire Dragon stole the show. First, it was a huge portion for the price and had a great balance between sweet, salty and spicy. It was one of the best rolls I have ever had in Scottsdale. Needless to say the three $8 saki bombers I enjoyed made everything taste better not that the food needed the help. I got five bombs out of each order which is more than I expect but much appreciated. My gf got the Cool Cucumber cocktail with gin and loved it. It was strong enough to enable me to convince her to go across the parking lot to check out another bar and more cocktails. The service and atmosphere were both pretty decent. Not memorable for being amazing or terrible which is a plus compared to most places. Overall, we will be back. Based on the food, prices and saki volume I would recommend Pure for happy hour over Ra, Stingray and Sapporo. It is a close call between this place and Sushi Brokers. Round #2 will be necessary to make such a call."}
{"text":"Two words: crunchy rice.   I'm sorry, but for $15 a roll the rice shouldn't be crunchy, and it should stick together enough to get the piece to your mouth.   Nigiri wasn't helped by the rice either.   Fish quality seemed fine, but the art is in the rice and this was a failure on the level of grocery store sushi.   I would suggest spending your $60-$75 on some quality ingredients and cooking for yourself."}
{"text":"My husband and I have always wanted to try Pure, but with so many sushi options (and favorites) in our area, it took us much longer than usual to get there. Happy to report it is now on the top of our list! Contrary to other posts, our service was excellent, the quality was great and pricing fair as well. We had 20 minutes left on happy hour,which was great to save a bit on numerous items. Great feel inside...we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are lucky to have Pure as our closest option for Sushi.  We have been several times and i'm sure we will go many more.    We have tried many different items and have never been disappointed.  We can recommend any of the specialty rolls, but love the Vegas, Dragon and Lobster rolls.  They also have a number of cooked dinner options for those who don't like raw and we have tried a few of them with good results.  The decor has a modern theme and pretty cool.  They also have a misted or heated patio (depending on the time of year) that is a nice option as well.  Staff has always been friendly and helpful.  My one complaint is that it is priced on the high side, which when it is your local place makes it more difficult to go as often as we would like."}
{"text":"Pure Sushi is simply the best place in AZ for sushi... In reality I can't say I've had a better sushi roll even at places like Nobu or the high end sushi in Hawaii. We love the Happy Hour as the regular menu can be on the pricy side. We come here once a week. Do not pass on the Creamy Baked Lobster roll or my personal fave the Poke."}
{"text":"Yum!  You have to come here for happy hour.  Great food, excellent happy hour menu and beautiful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Solid three stars, but really can't be more than that. Place was quite packed on a Saturday night, and I really don't get it. The Fish was pretty fresh, but overall the sushi was just OK. Really, good sushi is a lot about the rice, and the rice really just was not well prepared. I got the ama ebi and the fried heads did not come out hot and were somehow not cooked enough... I was picking pieces of shrimp shell out of my teeth! our waitress was very nice, but it took a while for what little we ordered to come out and unfortunately, they put us next to the loudest people possible!   Also quite pricey for what you've got. Overall, disappointed"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for happy hour. We almost ordered everything from the happy hour menu, and everything was excellent! We sat on the patio, and was very relaxing. The service was great. We suggest ordering the Goyza, California Roll, Crunchy Roll, and anything with the fries. We will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"Nice contemporary atmosphere, good service, and good sushi rolls ... and very good price for Happy Hours   Went there for sunday lunch, they have happy hours (yes, even on sunday)  Selected sushi rolls and appetizers were half price ... some drinks special as well  Ordered couple of HH sushi rolls, most are ok but I like the fire dragon rolls the best ... it really gets a good kick to it .... if you like spicy, it's a great choice ... ended up ordering a second one ... it was that good  Will be coming back some other time to try other things they have offer"}
{"text":"Pure Sushi typifies what a high-end sushi place should be...a mix of a simple, casually-upscale atmosphere (including a terrific patio area), lounge music that sets the mood without drowning out conversation, good service and, of course, excellent sushi (and other menu items). It's definitely on the high-end of the price spectrum, and sure you could get sushi as good for half the price elsewhere, but it's not your weekly sushi place...you come here for the vibe. Pure is a great choice for a date or nice night out with friends or family. I'm thrilled to have this place in my neighborhood and hope it sees continued success (they must be doing something right, if they opened a second location in Old Town)."}
{"text":"This place has an EXCELLENT happy hour (3 to 6)!  Everything I had was delicious and the sushi was fresh and prepared with care.  The staff was very kind and seemed to work well together which made for a great environment to enjoy a wonderful meal.  The place looks surprisingly normal from the outside but is a true gem inside.  Great experience all around."}
{"text":"Despite the name, Pure Sushi isn't for Sushi purists...but if you're a fan of rolls, then good times may be found here.    Pure Sushi is all about monster rolls...with fillings that ranges from crabs to shrimp tempura to deep fried soft shell crabs...and over the top are things like salmon, halibut & scallops...and to top it all of, you get wide range of sauces from sweet onion salsa to sweet chili to  kiwi yuzu.   Also good selection of bento box lunches though the loungy atmosphere and thumping music can feel slightly off in the bright Phoenix noon day.    Really just 3 stars for the food, but we added an extra star for the spacious patio and cool decor."}
{"text":"This place used to be good.  We were regulars   Now, the food just doesn't seem fresh.  This includes the fish and vegetables.  Just today the asparagus and cucumbers were brown and the tuna tasted old.   Hope the owners are able to right this ship."}
{"text":"Pure is in the Grayhawk Plaza in Scottsdale so understandeably is located in a very hip location. I went there on Sunday with my friend for lunch and was plesantly surprised to find they have happy hour on the weekends too!! The HH are from noon to 6 pm so we could eat to our hearts content at very cheap prices. The food was very good, we ordered all different kinds of rolls- california, salmon, rainbow, crunchy . The helpings are also very good, 8 in one plate so quite filling. The staff was attentive and the ambience was also pleasing. It may be more expensive otherise but given they have happy hours everyday of the week, Id certainly go back during those times."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and fabulous!  The proportions were big and tasty! Our server (Kristen) was excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place. Not your typical looking Sushi Bar, no Jap theme here - very modern. Yes, the $$$ is high, but most Sushi places are. Just a way cool place. The only thing that would make it better for me, is free wi-fi.. Sorry always working.. LOL."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sushi is so fresh and the service is so friendly. I love that my favorite waitress, Kristen, always knows what we want. We go there quite often and so we don't even have to order. She knows that we are trying to do less carbs so she will alter each dish a little for us. For example, instead of taro chips with our ahi poke we will get lettuce wraps instead. It's the little things like that that makes dining there so great after a long day at the office!   They have Zipang, a delicious sparkling sake. A must try if you love bubblies! They have a great wine selection as well.   We love to sit out in there patio when the weather is nice. The bar seating is great and so is sushi bar seating. Not a bad seat in the house! Great ambiance! I can tell this is a very well managed place! The parking is never an issue so this is one of our favorite sushi places!"}
{"text":"I am very thankful for Pure in North Scottsdale.  There aren't many good sushi places in the Phoenix Metro area, Pure helps fill the void.  I've been 5 times and have always been happy.  The fish is extremely fresh and cut very well by the sushi chefs.  I always get the Hamachi sashimi, salmon, and tuna sushi, and the Fire Dragon roll.  These items are always outstanding.  The other rolls such as the Albacore Ceviche Roll and the spicy tuna roll are also good.    I usually love rainbow rolls, however, I am not a big of it at Pure.  They use crab mix, instead of straight crab, which grosses me out a little bit.  Too creamy!  The salmon, tuna, shrimp, and avocado that they put on top of the rainbow roll is sliced so thin, you can't even taste it.  This is my only complaint thus far with Pure.  The drink menu is great.  I love the Lychee and Pear Martinis and the cold unfiltered sake.  The drinks can get a little pricey, so be careful.    They also have some Japanese appetizers, salads, and dinner entrees, which I have never had.  I've just stuck with sushi.  But if you don't eat sushi, there are other items that you can get.  The atmosphere is contemporary and beautiful.  Service is always solid.  They have a large table in the 2nd dining room for larger parties.  Great for Birthdays or groups that are celebrating.    Overall, I highly recommend Pure for fresh and tasty sushi and rolls."}
{"text":"I'm brand new to Yelp and it's about time I've let people know about Pure Sushi! I've been here dozens of times. It's extremely consistent and clean. The menu is imaginative and the service is impeccable. They are knowledgable about the menu and very friendly.  You can't miss with the crisp curried lobster spring rolls, the papaya slaw compliments the dish well. The fish is so fresh that you can still taste the sea water on the tuna! Bright red - FRESH! Come here soon, you'll probably see me."}
{"text":"Ate here on a quiet Sunday evening. The sushi & sashimi is quite good, but the service is terrible. We were greeted by a yawning hostess, had 3 different servers over the course of an hour, had to ask for parts of our meal, and were made to feel that it was an imposition to serve us. In this economy, restaurants are fighting to keep a customer base. Pure is not."}
{"text":"Hostess - next time I should take note of the warning sign; when a restaurant hires a 16 year old in a crop top who flaunts attitude as a hostess...turn and walk out. I didn't. Shame on me.   Decor - great, actually. Too bad it wasn't edible. Food certainly wasn't.  Waitress - service was friendly, albeit a little confused. Request for hot, green tea resulted in ice tea. Upon return, was offered some green concoction that was hot, green and tasted like seaweed. Sorry - this notcha macha!  Gyoza - yowza! Strike one.   Miso - the star of the night. It's virtually impossible to screw up miso soup.  Sushi nigiri - I had tuna, salmon, yellowtail and shrimp. These are the most popular items sold in any sushi restaurant...Not a single one was fresh. Rice was very undercooked. Ginger stank.   Sashimi bowl - my wife is in agony now after eating only 4 bites.   Pure Sushi - shame on you.   Scottsdale residents - I'm an out of towner, I have an excuse. Why you all have been giving this place good reviews and are returning is beyond me.   Bad. Really bad."}
{"text":"We went there for sushi. Ordered a few of the standard items found on all menus. Also ordered what the call \"lollipops\" (cucumber is used instead of rice). Cleaver idea - sorta awkward to eat, but tastes very good. Overall presentation of the other sushi items was thoughtfully created. I like! Drinks are a generous pour. Decor is modern, clean, hip. Clientele is 20-40s something. We went Friday night and it was jam packed from like 530 to almost 8! We had a 730 reservations - do make a reservation.  Would I go again? In a heart beat. Outstanding place. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent, and prices aren't horrible. The downside is the service, which isn't a matter of slow servers, but a lazy manager. Both times we've gone for lunch, there's been one server and one bartender, both working full speed. And then a manager playing on his phone sitting on his thumb. Even watched him being asked for help, and he made a joke out of it and seemingly shrugged it off. So, the place is worth checking out, but unless you see your server standing around, don't blame them for the slow service, chances are they're overburdened by trying to make up for an empty suit."}
{"text":"Great service. Great vibes. Great drinks. Great music. Hands down best sushi in Scottsdale. Plus, they had the World Cup of Hockey on, gotta love it."}
{"text":"Enjoying an amazing birthday dinner with family and friends... With a sushi feast to make the gods green with jealousy!"}
{"text":"Just realized my last review for Pure was two years ago! Time for a update! And yes, I have been back a few times in the past years, and my experience has just gotten better and better! Thanks for your improvement, Pure! Now that you are offering happy hours, it definitely made it better :) Especially the weekend noon - 6 times!"}
{"text":"I have been anxious to try this spot as it is a half block from my house. I am a huge fan of sushi and Japanese food.   Unfortunately Pure Sushi was mediocre in food then less desirable in service. In sitting at the bar, one would assume the approach would be one on one. Friendly. Even possible or hopefully personable. The bar here is a far cry from such notions.  Be it the food is not expertly prepared. I kinda expected that. The lack of service and care at the bar would have still brought me back for a second go. The female brunette bar keep would walk aimless from one task to the next without care that she had a guest at the bar. Nose in air and seemingly no thought of guest services or what she was actually getting paid to do.  Way to disappoint..."}
{"text":"I recently moved to area and was having trouble finding great sushi. Pure is kind of hidden in a shopping center, but I'm so glad I found it! The decor is nice and you definitely get the first impression that this is a clean, quality restaurant. The sushi is top notch. I particularly love the Dragon Roll and the Pure Vegas Roll. The fish is fresh and the sushi chefs are friendly. I feel totally at ease as a solo diner at the sushi bar. My only complaint is that the waitstaff is less than attentive, but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place is super mediocre. We ordered sushi rolls that were not made with sushi rice so the rolls had a funny tasting texture to what we're normally accustomed to when eating sushi rolls. The only redeeming factor to the meal with the bowls. We had the chirashi bowl and also the eel bowl. Eel bowl was not bad but not great. The chriashi bowl was actually pretty decent. Overall, not great food ."}
{"text":"Great service, extremely friendly staff and the Manager \"Julius \" is terrific. Nice contemporary atmosphere and the food is mouth watering."}
{"text":"Get the Box Sushi... Excellent flavor variety and best of all it is unique! The service is friendly too"}
{"text":"By far, the best sushi place I have been to yet. Kind of a drive for me in Tempe, but worth it.  The interior is just stunning with draping white curtain sperating certain tables and new-age square lanterns on the ceilings and walls. A sushi bar and drink on opposite sides with a small, private room opposite the hostess stand.   My sorority sister and I sat outside on the wrap around patio which was lined with tables. We went during thier Sunday happy hour (love sunday hapy hours) and got the best service. We order adamane, the crunchy roll, fire dragon roll, Philly roll, California roll. Rolls came in 5 pieces but for half the prices as non-happy hour rolls. They were delish.   Between us we split the bill in half and with tip, each paid about $20 which for 6 rolls, an app and drinks... I thought was really awesome.  The place is located in an upscale shopping center."}
{"text":"we visited the scottsdale location on a sunday afternoon and were the only customers at that time. The service was slow and the food portions were small and overpriced the taste was just average... i'd much rather go to RA"}
{"text":"Pure Sushi has great food, although a little pricey.  Normally I order sushi, but this last time I opted to order the filet. It was surprisingly good, with a Japanese/Asian twist.  The atmosphere is modern with a boutique feel and has a really cool bar.  The service was great, very friendly, and knowledgable staff."}
{"text":"The food is more generic each time I go. You can definitely tell there's been a change of ownership! Quality is lacking as is the service. My salad must have been shaken out of a bag - seriously? Their version of sushi is like Pei Wei is to Asian Food (think WalMart with Nieman Marcus pricing!)"}
{"text":"Pullled in here for the first time after work, it's nearby and decided to finally try.  I waited MUCH too long.  This bistro tops the Stingray locations anyday.  I was actually pretty much sold right when I walked in, since the atmosphere and decor completely clear the nervous system of any stress.  I took my place at the Sushi bar, and was thoroughly charmed by DJ, who seemed to be the head Chef that evening.  Not only was what I ordered delicious, perfectly fresh, and gorgeous to look at -- DJ kept plying me with all sorts of ingenious and remarkable creations of his (Monkfish Liver with Blackberry Emulsion?  Weird?  Hardly.  A must try).  Perfect in every way, and DJ needs to have his own Food Network Show.   Run here, and let the place take you to a truly Higher Plane of Happiness!"}
{"text":"I have come here on many occasions and am always happy when I leave. The lunches are huge and delicious, I have tried the Salmon Avocado Bowl and a few of the bento boxes, all of which were delicious. The staff is always very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I just love this place! Been here three times now. Had their latest creation, the WHite Monster Roll, and my favorite is the Lobster Roll. Very busy last ime because of Phoenix Open. Everyone was working hard, yet still had impatient customers. For us, our service was perfect. Folks! Good food takes time! If you want instant fast food, go where they preoare food from a can or a bag and microwave! This is beautiful, and excellent prepared sushi! Great service."}
{"text":"We ended up here because of attending the Phoenix Film Festival.  Wanting something light before sitting through a movie sushi seemed to be the logical choice.  We chose Pure for the proximity to the festival and the Yelp reviews.  All I can say is \"what in the world are people thinking\".  I know we are spoiled by having Hana and Nobu in our backyard.  This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.  I recognize how \"lucky\" we were to be seated at 6:15 on a Friday night.  We were ok with the hustle of the food since we were on our way someplace.  I take exception to the quality of the fish.  First we ordered a dragon roll which was served on a very warm plate.  Cold sushi, warm plate = not good.  My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.  Frozen too long, thawed or stored incorrectly?  Not sure, tasted like sponge.  We did have a misorder which we will take full responsibility for ordering some faux, convoluted lobster roll.   Then our table was cleared and our final plate came out to which my husband and I forgot we ordered and apparently the waitress did also.  We took it to go.  Because my stomach is not feeling well today I doubt it will get eaten.  Note to host, hostesses, since we were seated next to the host/hostess stand we do not wish to here about your sex life and how you took advantage and humiliated some woman you were dating.  I expect that from a 18 year old at Fridays not a 40 something anywhere.   Tonight we are going to Hana or Nobu and repent for even thinking we could obtain the quality and ambience at Pure B.S."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Happy hour is amazing... We order 7 different app plates and share them and leave full! The prices you can't beat. You won't be disappointed coming here!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fish so my review is not based on the quality of the sushi, although I do like their California Rolls. I've had their teriyaki, noodle dishes and soups.  I've eaten here several times and the food (remember, not talking about the sushi) is always good, not spectacular, but good. It's everything you would expect from a nicer sushi place just on fancier, interestingly shaped plates. Though the staff is friendly, service is extremely slow. I just ate lunch there; I ordered the chicken yakisoba and my friend ordered the sushi lunch special. When we arrived there were 2 other tables of 2. Because of this I was expecting our food to come out pretty quickly but instead we waited nearly 45 minutes for our food to arrive. That's just way too long of a wait in my opinion. Of course our server was attentive, refilling our drinks and what not but we were hungry and did not want to spend all afternoon on lunch.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed in the quality of the sushi, just don't expect timely service."}
{"text":"Pure has an incredible happy hour on Saturdays and Sundays. The prices are amazing, sushi was fresh, and the atmosphere was great during the college bowl games. We had two small children with us, and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. Our server's name was Jess and she was great! We will be checking this place out again in the near future. If you have a group of 8 or more call ahead and reserve the front room, it has its own private television and allows for a more private experience."}
{"text":"AHHH MAZING!  Kelly, our server, made the trip there 4 stars alone.  She was so friendly and kind and looked like she really enjoyed her job!   Since we were there during AZ restaurant week, we ordered from that menu.  For appetizers, I had the tempura, mom had the tuna and avocado poke, and dad had the bbq ribs w/sweet potato fries.  The appetizers had so much food that they could've been their own meal!  The tempura was fried crispy and included 3 big shrimp plus several vegetables.  Mom's tuna poke was melt in your mouth yummy, and dad's ribs were fall of the bone good!  After that deliciousness, the main entrees came out.  My mom and i ordered sushi...with the restaurant week menu, we had our choice of two rolls - one regular and one specialty.  I had the CA roll and the lobster roll (to die for!).  Mom had the spicy shrimp and the dynamite roll (also to die for!)..the only thing i didn't like was the eel sauce on the lobster roll, but that is just me.  Dad had the sea bass and it was delish.  Since we were celebrating my birthday, the server brought out my dessert (included in restaurant week menu) with ice cream and a candle!  I was relieved they didn't sing :).    Overall a great place, good vibe, and nice atmosphere.  I just wish they weren't so far away!"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour before the Sun's game for a quick bite to eat.  As soon as we walked through the door, the delightful owner greeted us and sat us down right away! Kellie was our server and she was amazing! We ordered just off the happy hour menu and everything we had was SO DELICIOUS. We're from Vancouver, BC so we've had our fair share of sushi and this place, well...let's just say I wish it was in Vancouver too! Order the dragon roll, tuna poke and lobster roll. You will not regret it. We're actually thinking of going back before we head home! A MUST VISIT!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, I was in the middle of moving into a new apartment. My husband and I were not very dressed up, but this was the only place still serving dinner, and we were starving. Despite our casual attire, the staff was super friendly and attentive. The interior may be modern, but the service is old fashioned nice.   I have since been back and enjoyed each visit. While they are not breaking any new ground here, the sushi is fresh and tasty and the cocktails are excellent. There is also a nice wine selection and lots of other Japanese food.   Do not be scared off by the all white, super-chic scottsdale look - this is a good place for a date or an evening with friends."}
{"text":"5 years ago this place was awesome. We don't know what happend. The service was really bad. We saw one of the cooks eating gum. We think that is not professional. So sorry we don't like to give 1 star but this is how we feel. I know is very hard to please everybody."}
{"text":"We love this place. I'll let everyone else brag about the sushi because it's amazing. But I want to shout out to the best margarita I've ever had! They call it a margarita martini, and it's amazing. I know, I know, a margarita at a sushi place? Trust me! Try it."}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  Sat outside and watched the first half of the Thursday Night Football game here!  It was cold out, but the heaters they have hanging from the ceiling made it very comfortable.  Very cool layout, very nice sitting area inside, nice seating area outside, and an awesome bar!  Plenty of options, whether you want to be there to enjoy time with family, or to go enjoy a football game with some buddies... It is a perfect place for both.   Very friendly staff, after the hostess sat us, I asked her what sushi roll she recommended, she said the \"White Monster Roll\".... I got it.... It was bomb.  It was a bit more expensive than other sushi places I have been to, but the food and experience makes it worth every dime.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good sushi and a great time!  Thanks Pure."}
{"text":"In a word . . . Disappointed!   We arrived in time for Happy Hour and ordered a number of items from the discounted HH menu -- gyoza, sliders, shrimp tempura, fire dragon rolls and calamari. They brought everything at once -- it hardly fit on the table. Since everything was cooked, by the time we got around to eating it, after trying to organize the platters and dishes on the table, everything was cold. Most of the dishes were tasty, but the soggy calamari with asian pesto dipping sauce was abominable! We also had the sashimi platter and tuna tataki. As always, the fish was fresh and melt in your mouth.  I have always been a huge fan of Pure Sushi . . . but the service we received on an early Tuesday evening was mediocre at best. At three minutes after 6 pm (the end of HH), our server asked if we wanted another drink. Three minutes after 6!!!  A conscientious server would have come by three minutes to 6 and said, HH is over in a few minutes, would you like to order another drink, or last call for HH . . . and then, as I wrote above, all the items coming out at one time . . . should never have happened that way.  I hope this is just an anomaly because I have really loved this place since it first opened. I hope it is not just riding on its reputation."}
{"text":"Service was good, Sushi is priced high for the portion size served. I can say that we were served the smallest rolls in my entire life of eating Sushi."}
{"text":"Reasonable fishes for the sashimi platter, a little warmer than it should be. Vegetable Udon was below my expectation, vegetables were over cooked and sauce was not right one.  This restaurant is three star level from the California standard."}
{"text":"My date introduced me to the Lobster Roll, his favorite and now I know why. We will definitely be ordering that again. We also shared the Caterpillar Roll though I've had better. The Molten Lava dessert with vanilla ice cream was well worth it. For drinks, the Buddha Beer with bottle shaped like a buddha was great fodder for conversation (the server suggested taking it home to use as a flower vase)."}
{"text":"Some girlfriends and I were spending a weekend in Tempe and really wanted to enjoy a nice sushi dinner. We found great reviews about Pure here on Yelp. We had a reservation during happy hour and planned to head to some bars in old town Scottsdale after dinner. Unfortunately we failed to map the place out and didn't realize that North Scottsdale is quite a distance from downtown Scottsdale where we had been spending a lot of our time. After a $50+ cab ride from Tempe we were in a funk and just hoping it would be worth it. It definitely was! All the staff was so friendly and helpful. Our waitress, Kellie, was great about answering questions and making recommendations. The food was incredible, probably some of the best tasting and freshest fish all three of us have ever had. We tried just about every roll on the happy hour menu and they were all delicious, especially the dragon roll. The happy hour prices were an insanely good deal and we ended up spending just barely more than our cab ride over for an amazing dinner with several glasses of wine, as well. On top of all of this, despite our table being reserved for a party coming in after us, we were not rushed through our meal and Kellie even brought over a complimentary dessert and told us they appreciated us coming so far out of our way to visit their restaurant. After speaking to another super friendly waitress and bartender to get recommendations for bars to head to we left the restaurant feeling completely taken care of and more than satisfied with our choice. I would absolutely come back here for the amazing service and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour: 3-6pm= great rolls + great prices!!!  Service: very attentive and friendly   Ambiance: nicely decorated and clean"}
{"text":"I first tried out Pure Sushi at the South location, which I loved. Just last week, we ventured north to this location, and it is equally amazing. Nobody does it better (not RA, not stingray, not Kabuki, not Sushi Roku). The fish is exquisitely fresh, and the artistry is amazing. My favorites are the salmon sashimi, the white monster, the dragon, the philadelphia (with raw salmon), and the rainbow. Maybe especially the rainbow. The mango ice cream for desert is also fabulous.  I just love this place."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Made it just in time for Happy Hour.  Our server Kristen was super helpful and made it a great experience.  Our new sushi place."}
{"text":"Overpriced sushi with underwhelming service and just OK fish. First, our nigiri order was mixed up. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but, it took 40 minutes to be corrected.  The part of the night that ensured I will not be returning to Pure was watching the man who was checking the orders smell our lollipop roll, ask a waitress \"Should we remake this?\", then proceed to give it to us with the explanation, \"Your roll has truffle oil on it. If it doesn't taste good we'll remake it for you.\" AKA someone spilled truffle oil on our sushi and they tried to just give it to us. Obviously, Pure does not know what quality control is and the restaurant is too cheap to remake one lollipop roll for a customer with a 100$+ tab. Tonight was unacceptable. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Been to Pure about 5 times over the course of the past year and it is consistently impressive every time. We've sat at the bar, the sushi bar, and at tables in the dining room and all options are enjoyable. Great drinks too. I would've shied away due to it being in a shopping center, albeit a nice one, but I'm very glad I didn't."}
{"text":"I was here previously and it was great so  chalking this visit up to me not ordering their best options. The food was mediocre at best. Service from the server was good. I rarely post reviews, but after having sat at the sushi bar and hearing the manager bark his comments at the chefs, I feel like I need to report him.  My sympathies to the chefs that are working so hard and have to follow the direction of someone who wishes he had real power. I'll be back, just to do another sample of food and see if the chefs are still alive."}
{"text":"You must go for the happy hour deal. Great prices for sushi and drinks with a very good but smaller menu. Service great, food great, ambience good, what more do you need."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with hubby and had a reservation for 7:45.   We got there a bit early and had a drink at the bar.  I had the caipirinha which was good and hubby had the Asian Pear martini - which was very refreshing.  We were called to our table and, even though my husband had asked to sit next to me, they sat us at a small table where they then turned it on the longer side so we could sit next to one another.  Thankfully we like each other because we were definitely in each others space all night during dinner.  It really got to us when a couple came in 1/2 hour after us, no reservation and they get the 4-top right next to us and they sat next to each other.  Nice way to treat a reservation!  We had the Tuna Carpaccio (very good), the calamari tempura (eh, fried very crisp but the sauce wasn't great), Tuna and avocado Poke (very yummy).  We had ordered 2 rolls for dinner and a Sashimi plate with a side of rice.  They brought out the rice right away - and I had to send it back otherwise it would have gotten cold waiting on the entrees.  We got the Sashimi and it really was very fresh and tasty.  We had the black cod, yellowtail, ahi tuna and salmon.  Dude -- very fresh and really great cuts of fish.  We scarfed down the plate in no time.  We ordered hot sake as well and it comes in little baby bottles.  You would think it was made out of gold.  Then the waiter came by and asked if there was anything else we wanted -- he had forgotten our rolls.  Ok, just make us another sashimi plate -- yum.  Yes, it was that good to order it again.    The food was good, the place is very pretty but there really is no one managing the place thats a \"grown up\".  The girls at the hostess stand were way too young to call the shots and the waitstaff is very young as well -- they need a manager.  I think there are alot of places out there where you can get really good fresh Sushi. The service here really lacked -- and this place is not cheap.  Oh, and hey guys?  The people you sat at the 4-top ate one appetizer, one round of drinks and they split one entree.  They spent about half what we did -- and I'm sure they'll be back.  Not sure we will though..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Pure Sushi a couple weeks ago after we had been craving sushi. We went pretty late on a Saturday so the dinner crowd was gone. The sushi was fresh and delicious. We ordered 3 roles and that was plenty. We liked each one!"}
{"text":"SO DISAPPOINTED!  Have been a regular on weekends for their fantastic happy hour that began at 12noon. Went to go today and in their infinite wisdom decided to cut that out a changed the times,now 3-6. We will not be back."}
{"text":"After bed experience in 2012 and avoiding this place for about 2 years, decided to give another shit, was pleasantly surprised with changes, very nice menu with good choices in sushi tools as well as main dishes, after several visits looks like they now take service mostly better than before, waiters has no ledge about dishes and special and more available than in my first experience overload good dinning choice for average bill 50-60  dollars per person"}
{"text":"Easily forgettable.  Nothing really stands out.  Ok in a pinch but so many better places with knockout sushi.  We asked for their hottest roll the fire dragon.  Decent taste but heat level is laughable.  Tuna tataki was way over cooked and resembled chicken in taste.  The biggest disappointment the Toro.  Poor poor quality.  Save your hard earned money and sanity."}
{"text":"12 year anniversary. My wife and I Love great sushi and this place is definitely it. Beautiful atmosphere, great service our server was Arianna she was very accommodating and pleasant. I have a GLUTEN intolerance. They even have several sauces that are gluten free as well. We ordered the Fire dragon roll, Salmon lollipop, Salmon sashimi, spy tuna, spy shimp we added cucumber and cilantro and a philly roll. All I have to say SUPER FRESH. We do sushi take out every Thursday and this will definitely be my new spot!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Sushi is always fresh, which is important to me. The staff are always friendly and eager to please. Happy hour specials are a must! Can't beat the prices for such great sushi!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Pure was last night. Loved it. We met two other couples and really had a great time. The place was hoppin' when we got there -- good sign -- but it was easy to get a quick drink at the bar and the wait was only a few minutes. Our server, Jaymie, was fantastic. The Dragon roll was phenomenal, as were the other three rolls we had. Sushi and sashimi were very good, too. We split the butterfish -- it was over the top. I will be getting that every time. If you like great food, sushi and a fun place, we think you'll dig Pure."}
{"text":"Ordered two of their Sushi and Sashmi lunch combo with 5 pieces of Nigeri and sashimi.  The variety is great.  Sushi rice was a little too sweat and dry.  I can live with that.  What I couldn't live with was the slices of Tuna Sashimi in both orders had the white tendon in them.  Completely inedible.  Imagine trying to chew on a nice piece of Tuna wrapped in floss, that's what the experience was.  Fed the pieces I tried to chew to the dogs.  Shame was looking for another place to add to my weekly sushi fix, but going back to regular place."}
{"text":"We never got to eat because we left after waiting half an hour for our simple bento box lunch order and no one came to check on us or even refill our waters or even just say sorry taking a long time. Their lunch service is the worst. Never again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we have given up on this place due to horrible costumer service. The sushi is decent. Our 4th unpleasant experience was when we called to place an order to go. We were put on hold for 6 minutes on a Monday night just like every time we call them. Last time they hung up on us. We ordered sushi and asked for extra ginger. When we got there, the waitress just handed me the bill. There was no extra ginger in the bag and when I asked for it, she responded with attitude \"it should be in the box\" and walked away. There are other places that you can get sushi and we really don't have to put up with their poor service."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for happy hour sushi! $30 gets lunch/dinner for two, with a couple cocktails leaving us relatively full. We typically order 3-4 different rolls, gyoza, and the lettuce wraps.  The lettuce wraps are not what you typically see at PF Changs. I don't want to give away the secret, just order it.   The rolls are awesome, as well as the gyoza.   In fact, I have not found a single item on this menu that I do not love."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife and son on New Years Eve.  Place was not crowded yet dinner was not nearly as good as it used to be.  Lobster and Rainbow roll were small, chicken yaki soba was horrible.  Service lacked too.  Lots of other great choices in the area."}
{"text":"Pure Sushi was OK...but there are better places to get fish..."}
{"text":"If I were to rate this place solely on the lunch bowls, I may have given 3 or 4 stars. They do put crab mix in both the Eel and Avocado bowl and Chirashi Bowl, which just honestly makes both dishes worse. Any dish or roll made of crab mix, which has absolutely no crab in it,  is worthy of only the trash can. I enjoy the Salmon and Avocado Bowl, but the Eel and Avocado and the Chirashi Bowls could both be improved by removing the crab mix and just adding an extra slice of non-mystery-meat fish.  One roll I ordered, which I would usually love from a quality sushi restaurant such as Hiro or Yasu Sushi Bistro, was a complete embarrassment. I got a softshell crab roll. One third of the ingredients were crab mix, which is low-quality fish marketed as imitation crab. It was possibly the worst 14 dollars spent in my life, and I bought several Tamagotchi, plenty of Pogs, and a lot of Pokemon cards back in my youth. I wish I knew where those cards were, but I also wish I could forget my food here. I could have gotten a better softshell crab roll at Teharu or Sushi Station for 3 or 4 dollars.  If I were a chef working here, I would be embarrassed and disappointed in the owner or creator of the menu.  Do a better job, and stop with the terrible American rolls disguised as Japanese sushi.  My name is Stirling Peters."}
{"text":"I ordered the Asian chicken salad and shrimp tempura - I'd give both a 5/10. The service was terrible - not once was I asked if I liked my food, if I needed anything else, if I needed a refill etc. none of the workers were very friendly - from the host to the server the customer service was poor."}
{"text":"Been here once. Sat at the bar for instant sushi. Very fresh and good quality. I wouldn't say that they are better than other places that I've tried. I love their sashimi salad. Not a big fan of their soup, too creamy. So I tried the udon soup, it is not that great, taste like water and not broth."}
{"text":"I have to wonder where such fresh fish comes from to Phoenix... Anyway, it was good. The food was good: not mind-blowing, just good."}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour at a friend's recommendation. Nice selection of good sushi at reasonable prices. It was a nice afternoon, so we sat outside on the patio. This made our service a little slower, but it was an enjoyable setting. It is in a corner location of a mall parking lot, so you have to put up with some cars and parking lot noise when on the patio.  Overall, good experience and plan to go back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner.  A great place for a romantic evening.  The Atlantic salmon entree is wonderful.  The sushi is also very good."}
{"text":"A great place to sit outside with friends. The lettuce wraps are phenomenal; the juicy crispness of the lettuce and the spicy, savory mayo are a perfect complement to the tuna. I highly recommend them.  Other dishes are good, but don't quite match the wraps awesomeness. The hoisin-tasting sauce on the Korean BBQ sliders doesn't really compute."}
{"text":"We ordered a ton of sushi, most from the happy hour menu and loved every sushi order! Definitely my new go to place for my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  First timers here, we were looking for somewhere that is nice and not too high on the price range but just a great sushi spot and I have to say, Pure Sushi delivers.   The staff was great and really super nice and welcoming.  We never wanted for refills on our drinks and the prices were really affordable and the sushi, it was so YUMMY!    We had a couple regular rolls but also the Oktoberfest...TO DIE! This place delivers without a lot of the pomp and circumstance that is associated with many of the other sushi joints around and I can definitely see this being our new \"go to\"."}
{"text":"Staff takes too long to get to the table especially if you are seated in the back room. Only happy hour prices are reasonable. Staff does not look happy.  Noisy. Hostesses inexperienced and not customer friendly."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices! I had the calamari, edamame, and cali roll. All of them were delicious. They also came out very fast and I was very impressed with that. 10/10 will go again."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi & great miso soup! Good deals during happy hour! Decor is urban, modern and white. Service is always friendly and good! They have outdoor and indoor seating! Always a stop when we come to town!"}
{"text":"I've never really been overwhelmed by the quality of sushi found in the Greater Phoenix area, but Pure changed all that for me this week!  I went for lunch and had the Sushi & Sashimi Platter.  It was perfect - delicious miso to start, just the right amount of food, outstanding quality and flavor of everything.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  I know I'll be back again soon.  The reason for no fifth star?  Even though the restaurant was virtually empty for our late lunch (2:00pm), we struggled several times to get our server's attention.  Disappointing, but easily overlooked considering the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"I won't lie, I wasn't impressed with Pure.  This is more like a 3.5 star review, I'm giving it a 4 because our server was great, my martini was well mixed and my wine was a generous pour.   Maybe I didn't have a great experience because we didn't order any specialty rolls?  The salad was creative but the edamame was awful.  Some were undercooked, some were overcooked and it wasn't salted enough. Honestly it may have been the worst edamame app I've ever had, the frozen stuff from TJ's that's been in my freezer for two months was better.  I didn't think the rolls were well rolled; several of mine fell apart. Its one thing when it's something huge like a specialty roll but an unagi roll or yellowtail scallion roll should be able to stay intact, especially with the seaweed on the outside.  The quality of the fish was great, but rather flavorless.    The atmosphere is fun and they have a large patio but I was shocked when our meal came to $100!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! I never get enough!!! This place is awesome!!! Their sushi is the best! Sushi is my favorite dish and have tried many places. I've never had anything better than here. I keep coming back!  And Asian pear is my favorite drink!!! I'm lucky I live 10 minutes from this location!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and fun environment. About what you expect from Scottsdale neighborhood as far as the atmosphere and decor.   Had the Pure Vegas Roll and the October Fest Roll - AH-MA-ZING!  Highly recommend both. Our server was very nice (she recommended the October Fest and was spot on!).   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let me say this before I begin: I'm not much of a sushi buff. I'll eat raw tuna until the sun comes up, but I'm not much for electric eel in zesty pepper sauces.  That being said, Pure is about as nice on the eyes as a sushi spot could be. Tucked away in a suburban shopping center in north Scottsdale, it looks unassuming enough from the outside, but the inside is über clean, modern and trendy like you'd expect for the Grayhawk area. The décor is excellent -- think a winter wonderland in the desert, with white and blue hues and a stunning bar. Most people go here to see and be seen, but the food is decent as well.  Get the toro, deliciously fattening tuna belly flesh with a zesty dipping sauce. Skip the non-sushi items on the menu. I got the salmon fillet and was very disappointed: dry, rubbery and salty, with not a hint of freshness."}
{"text":"Had not been here in 7 years and stopped in to get a carry out.  Had called ahead and Aubrey could not have been more accommodating.   She knew the menu well and was so very gracious while walking me through my smallish order. Sometimes it's the little things, yet Pure has been in this location for eons and having a front of the house special person like Aubrey makes the experience that more appealing"}
{"text":"I thought the sushi was mediocre for the price they were charging."}
{"text":"I love this place me and my friend always comes and even when I'm near I'll come alone. I can never get enogh of the egg rolls. Always 5 star for every visit."}
{"text":"Our expectations for this pretty place in a strip mall up North weren't very high. On a beautiful October evening, we sat outside and started with spicy tuna lettuce wraps. Really terrific!  My husband's sushi included a hand-roll and everything made him extremely happy!  I tried the unusual type of bass over veggies and black rice and savored every bite. We truly enjoyed it all and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour. And what's even better it HH 7 days a week! Yipeeee!"}
{"text":"Really, really good sushi.  You must try the salmon bowl! Hubby loves the tuna bowl. Best in town!"}
{"text":"In AZ for the holiday and we hit up this joint for dinner. Service was attentive  There hamasmi kama was the biggest I have ever had.and was taste the dipping sauce was lack luster.but doable Sushi was very average but fresh.  There salmon over leak was overcooked and dry. But in all it was a fine meal. I would go back if I was in the area and I ran out of Bologna at home. Biggest drawback.... Crown and water. It is ok to pour some Crown into the glass of ice and water..FYI I had a very nice water with a wave of crown. That my friends is a deal breaker for this cracker.."}
{"text":"I moved here from California and was bummed because I had the assumption I would no longer be able to get good sushi in the desert (whether my assumption was correct or not it's just how I felt :P). But then my father took me to pure tonight and my sushi doom was over! It's just as good, if not better than any fancy sushi place I've ever been too. If you know good sushi then this place is definitely worth going too. If it's a little bit of a drive for you it's still worth it. Service was great, our sushi chef was really good and made sure we were well taken care of. All these great reviews can't be wrong right!"}
{"text":"Our new Phoenix friends invited us to pure for their happy hour.  We arrived on a Friday night at 5 and the place was already busy.  We were a table of 6 and had a good server.  They have a great happy hour menu and we selected both hot and cold dishes.  Shrimp tempura, sliders and ribs were all very good.  Small selection of sushi on that menu but it was good.  Will come back and try the regular menu!"}
{"text":"Really really good good and very cheap HAPPY hour I had the California roll and the Korean BBQ sliders. No regrets:) very good food and good service although my server seemed very flustered"}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Pure Sushi is lovely..Asahi beer,pork sliders with crisp fries,taro with poke,calamari that are not greasey,and rolls,and a lot of other options.For a nice Saturday afternoon getaway this place can't be beat.fresh ingredients,professionals behind the counter and efficient service. We're here at a minimum of once a month. You won't be sorry you came.And if you are following a weekend game,multiple screens will keep you up to date re your team."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. My Pure experience was awe-inspiring, and singular to be sure. Chrissy, Dottsy, Mike and I stopped by Pure (per the recommendation of my boss) on a Saturday evening at 645PM. The restaurant was nearly empty; apparently posh scottsdalites like to eat at 9PM. We slid into a booth just across from the chef's workspace and pondered the immense menu for a while. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks ordered while we decided. Finally, delusional from hunger, Mike whispered the magic words, sending Dottsy and I into ecstasy: chef's choice.   The Chef was feeling effusive that evening and we were quickly served a 2 foot long serving plate of sashimi loaded with halibut, octopus, tuna, scallop, and salmon. Everything was so fresh I swear I could see it twitching. Just moments later a *massive* platter arrived with six rolls.  I cannot remember the details of each roll, but suffice it to say everything was unique and perfectly crafted. I didn't use a single drop of soy sauce the whole night it was so delicious.   Somehow, after all that, we wanted more, and the chef brought out three more rolls, one of which was baked and topped with gorgeous mushrooms in a tangy sweet brown sauce. Our server commented that none of these rolls were on the menu, just something the chef thought up. We were also served dessert which we attempted halfheartedly, as we were now full to the brim on aquatic delicacies.   I didn't see the bill, so I can't speak to the pricing, but the meal was everything I could have dreamt of in a sushi feast, so for special occasions (those happen weekly, right?) I will definitely make my way back to Pure."}
{"text":"A very nice experience overall. The place is comfortable and clean. Our server was helpful and friendly. The menu is a good balance of mostly traditional American-style Japanese fare with some creative twists. The service was quick but nor rushed. There was an understanding of the multi-step, multi-course, deliberative nature of proper Japanese ordering. And, lastly, everything was fresh, with a good balance of flavors and served at just the right right temperate (for example, not too warm and not too cold for the sashimi). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Pure Sushi! We sat on the outdoor patio since it wasn't too cold (plus the heaters warmed us right up). We were dressed pretty casual, which I was a little nervous about when I got closer to the ultra modern, trendy decor but the service was fabulous! The In & Out Roll, I fell in love with and can't wait to have again. We also had the Lobster Roll and a few different types of sashimi- all were great! Next time I want to try the White Monster Roll. We also enjoyed some sake and The OC martini was great!! Definitely recommend Pure Sushi."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood spot. On my last trip I had the Hokey Poke Roll and the King Crab Roll. Both had great flavor and I loved the spice of the Hoke Poke. We also had the sashimi platter which was fresh and tasty. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Scottsdale.  The sushi is second best to their great service.  Don't think that the sushi isn't fresh, creative and taste great.  The service is what keeps me coming back.  The environment you get is unlike any other and what they have created is genius.  Customers communicate with one another and the amazing staff makes it even easier to enjoy your time.   Today was another great experience from meeting great people like Edward and Brittany and them giving us great friend service. I say friend because I am not a customer at pure, I am always welcomed with a friendly hello and conversation.   They care about you and making your experience whether its just having a couple of drinks or a full on meal.   I truly appreciate great service and will always go to pure for the service alone ( but please keep making great sushi )."}
{"text":"I've been to Pure several times...but haven't been in a few months, and looking to try it out again.  Really enjoy the atmosphere...and food is really good...but I'm not so sure you can really screw sushi rolls up unless the fish is bad.  I can usually tell right away.  Friendly staff, kinda pricey!  I have a friend who used to work there and helped open the Oldtown location...during VIP night it was rockin'.  Free sushi and well drinks on them.  If you're going to open a restaurant that's the way to do it!"}
{"text":"First time here and we have had sushi all over US.  This is definitely good sushi and our waitress Kelli made excellent recommendations.  Definitely will be back to have Crunchy roll and Fire Dragon!"}
{"text":"Pure sushi is great for happy hour. Tuna and salmon rolls are only three dollars apiece and are on point. The rules are small in size but Two is really all you need. The indoor outdoor aspect of the restaurant is nice. There was a drunken man at the bar by himself when I was there, a little uncomfortable. Ate my sushi and bounced."}
{"text":"I've been a fan for at least 2 years now. Lucky I live near by too. This place is a diamond in the rough and almost as good as it get's. Love the modern, slightly contemporary atmosphere. The staff is wonderful and friendly. And since it's hard to screw up california rolls the best asset is ambience and sincere, friendly service. Therefore only a 4 out of 5 star rating: It couldn't hurt for the front lady to pull up a smile every now and then and at least pretend she cares about her customers.  The Sushi and Sashimi are awesome - the best I ever had. I love how they prepare it. Fresher than fresh. Any \"non-toxic\" or not \"cooked to death\" fish these days will be pricy. So if you're doing fish, raw or cooked - look out for wild caught not farmed and only the BEST.  The photo is nice but doesn't capture the \"juice\"."}
{"text":"Good sushi and reasonable prices. Lots to choose from on the menu. Loved Happy Hour!  Only issue was sushi plates arriving all at once which meant a very crowded table. Nice ambience. Our server Kellie was awesome. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"First and so far only time I have ever ate sushi that I liked! I did order the teriyaki chicken and it was delightful! It's a cool ambience in the restaurant, kinda small but cozy! Our service was excellent, all the staff was really nice and really put together. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The sushi options were very unique. We couldn't choose a favorite because they were all excellent. We had the Fire Dragon, Angry Caterpillar, Loch Nest, and Peppered Beef. All were very tasty and flavorful. We started with the Lobster Spring Rolls. Also an amazing dish. Best sushi in town."}
{"text":"Pure is such a Scottsdale high end sushi restaurant. All white posh decor. Small dining room inside with another room which must be private because I've never seen it being used. Bar area is very small, about 6 chairs able to fit at the bar and two small three high top tables. Patio area is nice, handful of booth seating outside to enjoy when the weather is nice.   Food is decent; nothing spectacular. Happy hour is your typical simple rolls like salmon, yellowtail, California etc for $3. Little fancier rolls for increased $6-8.   Service was okay. Had to hunt down server several times for water refill or to place an additional order."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch. Fish was very fresh, the service was friendly and attentive, and the prices were on par with what you would expect.   There was a miserable wretched lady next to us wearing sunglasses inside throughout her entire lunch and she complained about EVERYTHING! She was yelling at the sushi chef and demeaning him because he didn't understand the fish names in Japanese (I believe he was Hispanic, what do you want?!?!). We were in shock watching this.   She finally went to the manager and complained several times. The manager had to take the poor chef to the back and reprimand him and give the wench a free lunch. My friends and I felt that this wasn't the first time this lady got a free lunch. The reason I brought this up is to stress how well the place handled a horrible customer. It's tough to keep your cool, but the chef did his job well and the manager got her out of the place quickly.   I'd go back any time."}
{"text":"Nah, yet another sushi place partly fusioned and a wanna be meat market in Snobsdale. I am sick of waiters and waitresses who don't have a pot to piss in and yet have narcissistic attitude.  They should not be in a service industry.  Even the sushi chef had the attitude of Japanese superiority complex. Hey chef, if you are so great, why did you emigrate from Japan?  It's a good thing I didn't go there with any of my clients or potential clients. They would have walked out and I would have lost my opportunity.  I want to be fair. The sushi was good to excellent. Price is not the highest but in the high range. If you can turn blind-eyes to all the goings against the people factor in this restaurant, then go there.  Just like anything else, it's the people that make or break the product and services. I hope this place comes to a real quick realisation of repositioning their attitude. For their services were worse than from people at fast foods restaurant."}
{"text":"Supposedly the best sushi place in Scottsdale -- and I must say, I have to definitely agree. Not sure if it's the absolute best (I'm still partial to my local fav's... Although a few more visits here may sway my vote), but it IS in my top 3! The sushi and sashimi is so fresh (and doesn't have that icky fishy smell like some sushi places) it literally melts in your mouth - so yummy! And the drinks (especially the pear martini) are absolutely phenomenal!!! (a must-have!)   I definitely recommend Pure -- it's a great place for sushi with a wonderful atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff, and amazing happy hour prices -- I will be back for round two! :)"}
{"text":"This is my overall best place to enjoy sushi. Clean, great staff, the best happy hour ever! Wonderful outside patio, fun bar area and nice sushi bar seating. You cannot go wrong going to Pure!"}
{"text":"We had such a great private graduation party last night at Pure Sushi!! Phil was so great and easy to work with, even over the phone. Our waitress Rochelle was amazing. Wonderful evening. Pure Sushi made it a very special night in the white room!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  We are from the Boston area and come back on an annual basis.  Very happy with this visit!  The food was great and the waitress offered suggestions that we loved."}
{"text":"I love this place for a cool miami feel for sushi. The pear martini is great as well as the sashimi. I enjoy the scenery and ambiance of this place because it is very open and inviting. The lollipop rolls are also very good if you're looking for something healthy."}
{"text":"Great sushi place.  Went with some out of town friends. They were hesitant at first because they didn't relate Phoenix with good sushi. They left happy and with changed minds. We shared several rolls, the names escape me now. I love their iced green tea. It actually had flavor, the best green tea I ever had. I will return here soon with my local sushi eaters."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Amazing happy hour specials!  Service is fantastic and the food is always exceptional and the patio is great for a nice evening dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday.  From the moment we walked in, I wasn't all that impressed.  Sure the decor and ambiance  is nice, but I think this is a place where people go \"to be seen\".  The tables are so close together that people kept bumping into my husband's chair as they walked by and when I was getting into my seat, my butt was pretty much on the table next to us.  The sushi was nothing to brag about and the rolls kept falling apart.  My husband had finished his beer well before we finished our meal and the server never asked him if he wanted another beverage.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo....a good friend of mine took me here for Happy Hour to celebrate my birthday. Uhhh...after 15 years of friendship, how could she forget that I HATE Fish (Yes, all types of Fish!)  I had to scroll to the appetizer list and there it was --  Sliders: Pulled Pork with our famous Korean BBQ sauce, served with Cole Slaw and spicy mixed Frites. These were delish. I had two of this appetizer and was completely happy. I like that there are enough choices for me to consider on my next visit back. Cheers***"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our first date here a few years ago and decided to go back recently to celebrate his birthday. The sushi was very expensive, but it was good.  We had some salmon sashimi, a spicy shrimp roll and a shiromi lovers roll that had asparagus, crab and halibut. Its was all really good, especially the spicy shrimp. After all this we were still hungry for more and ordered the fire dragon roll- spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, fresh tuna on top sprinkled with cilantro and diced jalapenos- Awesome! Loved it!  It was expensive but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I want to immediately say the sushi here is 4 start quality, maybe 4.5.  It's always fresh and if you know what you like, the presentations and flavors really are above average.  Honestly, when we have visitors in town, I recommend this place because the quality is great and I know that's what a sushi lover cares about most!    So, why only a 3 start rating?  Plain and simple - quality of service.  The staff here is by far the least knowledgeable about sushi that I have every experienced.  It's clear they all want to be there because sushi is expensive and that's how tips get bigger.  Bartenders are completely uninformed about sake, which should always be an easy sell with sushi.  I had a server ask me to cash out in the middle of a meal once so she could go pick up her kid.  Just in case the managers care to read these reviews, a complaint like this should always come with some advice.  A better way to handle a server leaving in the middle of a meal is to transfer the check and let them collect all or part of the tip the next day.  Share some knowledge with the staff about the ingredients in the kitchen and why customers should love the product.  I could go on, but I'd rather focus on the food.  The chefs get it.  All of the plates look beautiful.  They have a high quality product and are proud to present it.  I wish there was a place on the bill to designate the entire tip to the back of the house.  Great sushi.  Always fresh."}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint.  Their food is always delicious - which continues to surprise coming from living by the ocean. Hooowwww dooo theyyyy do it?! They have a private patio with TV's (if you are sports fans), and the bar inside is an awesome place to wait if you called in a to-go order -- which we do more than I'd like to admit.  Attentive staff, and an incredible HH that is a must-try."}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar and I wanted a roll with salmon but didn't want any rice and wasn't in the mood for a hand roll so the sushi chef, Eddie, recommended the Loch Ness salmon roll. OMG! It was so delicious and fresh! They have this Scottish salmon that's so buttery and with the siracha and Asian pesto sauce, I have to say it was one of the best rolls I've had. No rice means I can eat it all and have room for more yumminess. Eddie took the time to make the roll to perfection and appreciated it. Well worth the wait! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went early about 6pm.  Clean and neat place, nice deco.  Service was great, server quick and friendly.  Food though was very average.  Good but nothing special.  I would go here again but it isn't my first choice."}
{"text":"Love love love Pure! Hands down my fave sushi in the area, and their happy hour rocks!"}
{"text":"A great place for lunch with a very modern  and chic interiorwhich is always pleasing - a great place for a business lunch too! I always have the bento boxes which have a little bit of everything in a good combo. The tempura is exceptional too. Nice to know that it's so close to home too!! YAY!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and waited to write a review until my second time.   To be honest, the first time we went (was during HH), we thoroughly enjoyed their food and we had their Gyoza, edamame, spicy tuna roll, Fire Dragon roll and some other special roll they had.  Sushi was very good and so were the apps.  Our problem though was the service.  We were greeted and asked if we wanted water \"or anything\", which was odd but we ordered a few cocktails and apps that were on HH.  The drinks took fairly long to get and actually our edamame came out before we got our drinks!  It was 5:30 when we ordered our other food so well within the HH window.  We got our food shortly thereafter and the waitress did not come by until we were almost finished with our last roll!  I ordered another drink on HH but she forgot it and then came back and asked if I still wanted it since it was not going to be on HH (she rung it in too late).  I did not feel like fighting with her so I refused the drink, with no apology from her about the mix up.  We were disappointed with the service but we really liked the food so we thought we would wait a few weeks and come back.  The second time, both the food and the service was bad!  We ordered virtually the same thing but got a rainbow roll instead of one of the other rolls during HH.  Again, edamame came out before our drinks.  I do not know if the avocado on the rainbow roll was bad or what, but it was brown and unappetizing.  The yellowtail also had a brown tinge to it.  When we asked the server if it is normal, she said the yellowtail can look like that at times because all fish is different... weird.  But she did say the avocado looked old but is probably still good.... weird again.  Needless to say, we tried pieces with salmon on top and low and behold, the seaweed was chewy -- almost as if it had gone bad.  We did not finish it.  Good old trustworthy spicy tuna roll may help matters.... nope.   Chewy seaweed again.  Fire Dragon roll = chewy seaweed.  The waitress said that is normal.  So, frustrated with the service here again and not in the mood to complain or waste any energy, we ate our Gyozas and edamame and requested the check. Although we ate two bites of the Rainbow Roll and we said we didn't like it, we were still charged.  If it cost anything more than $4, I would have said something.  However, the service was just as bad so not sure anything would have been done about it.    We definitely will not be going back here.  That same night, we went to Local Bistro right next door for dessert (we were going to have some at PURE and we were still hungry) and we had the best service.  Needles to say, that restaurant was packed at this time and PURE was only about a quarter full.  Does that tell you something? With the three other restaurants within walking distance of this restaurant, I would hope this place would have higher expectations for their service and food."}
{"text":"I've gone to many sushi places and we stopped here as its close to home.  The sushi was not top rated as many reviews have posted.  It didn't go over the top or offer anything unique.  Its super expensive sushi.  We can go else where in the valley and get better."}
{"text":"I dined at this amazing place on Sunday the last day of Restaurant Week - AZ. They put together an amazing menu that was really worth the cost.  Started with Miso Soup - perfect! Second had the Ahi Poke - which was prepared on these little triangles of what seemed like a soft corn tortilla. I could not figure out exactly what it was - and doesn't matter - all I know was Yummo! Next course was Sea Bass - prepared to perfection. Not too much flavor as to distract - but just enough.  Last was the roll dessert - with cream, berries and a sweet rice - I was in heaven.  All that and an amazing bottle of wine that was half off - sitting outside under the misters at a nice 90 degrees - in Beautiful AZ - who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"Nice place to enjoy happy hour and relax in a cool atmosphere.  The pear martini was well made and very good.  The bartender was friendly and made great drinks!"}
{"text":"* Update - I gave it another chance.  Service is still a bit slow near the end of your meal but overall,  it was much, much better.  Keep making sure that Tuna stays fresh and I may keep coming back.   (Previous post, now updated ) - Like one poster said,  unfortunately this restaurant has suffered in the last couple of years."}
{"text":"I must say this place has gone down hill, it used to be amazing! Walking in the door my daughter and I stood there for quite some time. The place was not busy due to the holiday weekend .The hostess looked at us  Never greeted us with a hello or a smile !! .  I was unclear if this girl even work here. I finally took it upon myself to sit myself and my daughter at the sushi bar she then walked over with menus. I have been in the hospitality industry all my life this is not someone I would have representing my restaurant. Looking around it looked very j unorganized and unclean. The fish did not look fresh which is presented in a case in front of you at the sushi bar.!!! I don't know call me crazy usually when you go to a sushi bar the chefs are very friendly and knowledgeable about different roles and specials they offer, this never occurred in this place. I don't recommend it I've eaten out many different places I will not be going back or recommending to anyone!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pure has some damn good sushi. We had a lot of standard rolls that didn't have a particular \"wow\" factor to them, but the fish was delicious.   The place itself, however, is totally -not- my style. Uberhip white everything with a wall made out of giant letters (the first thought that came into my head was \"I really want to climb into that 'R.'\") and flatscreen TVs. Oh, and poorly-designed restrooms (petty complaint, but still a pet peeve of mind). I'd like to come back... maybe during the day it will be less... uh...weird.   And... charging for edamame and miso soup? Really? Come on. Service was spotty, but our waiter did make an effort to apologize for any delays, so that was appreciated."}
{"text":"The sushi roll I got was very good. The BBQ Pork Ribs were AMAZING! Loved the sauce. The server was great too."}
{"text":"If your cheap don't eat here!  Expensive is good when it comes to putting raw fish in your mouth in the middle of the desert.  The sushi here is quality to the point that if I had no clue where I was in the US, and was served what I ate here last night, I'd have to say Hawaii or NYC.  That's a huge compliment considering how hard it must be to source fresh fish in AZ.  The tempura was great, the sashimi was awesome, and washing it all down with some sake and beer, made the blow of a big bill palatable.  Sushi is alive and well in the desert, and Pure is a great example of how to do it right."}
{"text":"Yelp gives Pure Sushi two $$ but I think it is closer to three $$$. The sushi was good, but I thought it was a little pricey, especially the alcoholic drinks. Other than that, great service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has a good happy hour and the sushi/food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"They do serve nice Lunch Bento Boxes SEVEN DAYS a week priced $11-18.  I had the salmon teriyaki lunch bento box ($13) that included an oriental sauced side mix green salad,steamed rice,one large tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables (two big pieces of sweet potato, one zucchini,one onion ring) My salmon was tasty and a perfect size for lunch,not only did I get all that food I mentioned but my salmon was on top of pan seared mixed vegetables including baby bok choy.   Service was especially good from our server and the manager."}
{"text":"Some of my friends have been bragging about this place and I was really excited when my Sushi group decided to have a meet up there.  I was not disappointed!  I ordered the famous Creamy Baked Lobster Roll, Happy Hour Philly Roll and the Pure Crunch Roll.  All were very good and the service was superb, the manager noticed an item on the table wasn't right and took the initative to correct it without being asked to.  The food was out quickly and accurately, and the waitress was on top of everything, I never saw the bottom of my water glass."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service. Honestly, the sushi even SMELLED bad. Super expensive given mediocre quality.  I live in the neighborhood, have eaten there several times. Always the same...I give up.  AVOID!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Old Town location but this one is closer to my house so I decided to give it a try. I didn't like it very much because the clientele here is older and stuffy and tall the tables were really small and close together.  We decided to get the fire dragon roll, white monster roll, and baked lobster roll.  I tried the dragon roll first and it was really spicy but tasty, the white monster roll was forgettable I wouldn't recommend it,  the baked lobster roll came last and was the best out of the three rolls we tried.  I like the Old Town location better because it's bigger and I feel more comfortable ordering sake bombers when I'm not surrounded but a whole bunch of old people."}
{"text":"We went here due to recommendations for others. The sushi was ok. Most of the specialty rolls had shrimp tempura which was a little disappointing. And the rice in the sushi was somewhat soggy. However my husband ordered the grilled salmon entree and the fish was delicious!"}
{"text":"Kristen, you really stunk up a rather lovely group lunch with a poor attitude. Perhaps you were swamped with tables and stressed out, i don't know, but it definitely wasn't our fault. And yet it felt like we were to blame for well, most everything.  We couldn't order hot tea because 'there weren't any pots (for the tea) and everybody is drinking green tea'. Yet the very next person in our group asked about coffee and that wasn't a problem. Forgive me - but couldn't the green tea be put into a coffee cup (or miso soup bowl for that matter)? I'm not a rocket scientist, nor do i play one on tv but...  And the snippy remarks just kept coming! At every visit. I've never had a waitress come to the table, get one or two typical requests for an extra sauce or another soda and then ask the rest of the table: \"Anyone else need anything? 'Cause once I'm gone, I'm not coming back...\"   Our group had 7 people. You and another waitress brought out nine plates of food, six lunches and three plates of sushi and when one of us wasn't served their lunch, because of the plate arrangement it may have looked like they were served, so they inquired.. \"Um, my lunch?\" Your full response was promptly forgotten after the words \"Well, we only have so many arms!\"  The person who signed for the lunch may have tipped you well but i would have tipped you to find another job, one definitely *not* in the service industry...   BTW: Food was good but it really sucked that we were insulted and / or mistreated every time you came to the table. {I hope you have a better day, because this clearly wasn't a good one.}"}
{"text":"Good food but a bit pricey. I have ate lunch there a dozen or so times. Alway good."}
{"text":"This gem of a restaurant is as good as many Japanese restaurants that charge double or triple the price. The sushi is as fresh as I have eaten in the best places, and the Salmon Teriyaki and vegetables are made to perfection. This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had. Ate here in September and then again last night....this place is super awesome."}
{"text":"Love your food but unfortunately as of late your service has suffered. Very slow drink service and waitress has lost orders and basically abandoned our table"}
{"text":"Our waitress Kellie made this place worth the drive to N. Scottsdale! We were in town for a girls trip and took a cab for sushi thinking it would be a quick trip but it was a $50 cab ride. After just mentioning this to her she took complete care of us and went out of her way to make sure we were happy. The sushi was really good but we kept it to simple rolls also. The happy hour menu was PERFECT for this and the price during happy hour CAN NOT be beat! Kellie gave us some reccomendations and areas to go and places to check out for our girls trip and she was right on with those as well. Every staff member we were introduced to gave us their opinions as well and were very helpful!   Love this place and would make the drive to come back the next time I visit, Just not via cab from ASU. :)"}
{"text":"My dad and I frequent this place often when we have lunch together.  The staff has been unfailingly nice, the prices are mid-range but the quality is great.  The lunch / happy hour specials rock socks."}
{"text":"3 stars mostly because I expected a sushi restaurant when I made the reservation due to the name, but it's really more a Japanese Fusion place. Food was good, drinks were good, atmosphere a little isolated and cold. If you are looking for trendy Japanese fusion this is the place, if you want good sushi go elsewhere. Sushi is basically a artistic appetizer here not a meal. I did get their sushi platter (because I came for sushi) and it was just not right. Lots of cooked items, not enough true sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi was good not great.  I have dined here before on many occasions.   The issue is the staff.  They should listen to the guest more and get the details right.  I ordered a large order of sushi to go.  I was staying at a hotel.  I checked my order receipt while I was waiting and the order was wrong.  Items were forgotten.  Once I did receive my order to go the extra items requested were missing so I had to go back and ask for additional chop sticks, soy sauce etc.  I had requested these items twice.  The staff tends to converse more with the locals that come in and not give attention to the other guests."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 3.5 if possible. The sushi was pretty good but I thought the lollipop roll was a little bland. I really liked the Pure sunshine roll, the negi hamachi, and assorted nigiri. The ahi avocado poke app was very good. We were hoping to have a few more options of specialty rolls that weren't tempura style or with cream cheese. It was nice to be able to get in easily at 8 on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Always a great spot!  We go here often.  Patio is wonderful during the spring.  Poke is amazing, their happy hour rocks."}
{"text":"Made reservation for a Friday at 5.45.  Arrived on time and our table was ready.  Good thing we had res---place was PACKED with Happy Hour people!!!!  Waitress dropped by table to say she would be \"right with us\" about four times, but we did not give our drink and appy orders until about 6.10.  Happily, waitress said she'd make sure we got the HH pricing.  It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks, another 15 for food.  We almost got irritated enough to bail, but then were convinced to stay---thank goodness we did.  As HH crowd cleared, service improved IMMENSELY. And food---quality and quantities rocked!  DS and I each started with avocado and ahi poke ($7).  HUGE portions.  Six poke laden chips on a narrow 12 inch platter...we could easily have shared, but son and I each managed to dispose of our share.  DH got the tempura fried shrimp ($4).  Five 4-5 inch shrimp perfectly encrusted in a light, crisp tempura with a yummy dipping sauce.  The four of us all had the miso soup, which was okay, but I like Yume's better.  Personal taste.  For entree, DH got the chicken teriyaki, which he said was \"f'ing-tastic\".  (Language!)  DS got the creamy baked lobster roll, spicy tuna roll, and fire dragon roll.  DSG got two vegetable rolls.  I got the sashimi platter with 5 different fish.  Huge quantities, everything so fresh and delicious and beautifully presented.  As I said, our service was much improved once HH crowd dispersed.  Ambiance was hipster and VERY loud.  Wish we had dined on the patio, which seemed quieter.  DH and I can't return.  I want to try the citrus-basil martini with the ahi poke while sitting on the patio on a quiet Sunday afternoon.  I just know that would be great!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Best sushi I have had in a while.    I went here with 4 colleagues after a round of golf at GrayHawk down the street.  We were seated promptly and the staff was super friendly.    We had close to 15 different rolls, some wine, and sake.   It was the best dinner of our trip and can't stop thinking of how good it was.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Party of seven arrived 10 minutes before happy hour ended. They were gracious and kind offering us happy hour. We ordered off both menus. All the food was first class! A few minor service flaws that I noticed but don't think my party did. All in all a great restaurant with very friendly, outgoing staff. Definitely will return! I love walking into a restaurant and seeing the staff smiling!"}
{"text":"I recently came to Pure Sushi for dinner and was very impressed with the experience! It had been a while since I had been in, and the atmosphere is sleek and sophisticated. The entire menu is extensive but not overwhelming. I ordered the Chirashi Bowl and it was AMAZING! It was perfect for someone who doesn't know what to order and wants a variety of fresh fish.  There was literally at least 20 pieces of fish on a bed of rice for $20! They had everything I wanted, octopus, salmon, tuna, and so many others I can't remember. The bartender, Cass was super friendly and provided great service. My friend ordered a Chirashi Bowl as well but did not want certain fish and they were super accommodating as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town and the sushi is fresh and tastes delicious!  One of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Okay, the food is really a 5 star experience, personally the best sushi I have ever had!  The reason I can only give this place 4 stars, the service...it's just way  too slow!  How long does it really take to go to Japan and back with your order??!!! WTF?  We had the In and Out roll, seaweed salad, Spicy tuna roll, and the Chicken Lo Mein noodles.  YUM-O, it was all absolutely delicious, beautiful presentation.  My favorite was the In and Out roll- crab, shrimp, asparagus, cucumber, avocado, tempura exterior and eel sauce-AMAZING!!!  We sat on the patio which was pretty nice, but it started to get a little cool so we attempted to turn on the gas lamp, it was not working so we asked for help and they were dumb founded!  We were told they would send someone out and it never happened.    If you are diabetic, you just may want to pack a snack if you come here, it's gonna be awhile before you get your meal and you just might pass out from low blood sugar!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I have never written a review of this place considering how many times we have been here. Great service, the food is really good. Fresh sushi. Fantastic happy hour. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Scottsdale...  We go here once, sometimes two or three times a month...  They have some of the best rolls ever, try the Vegas Roll or the Peppered Steak Roll, but don't stop there!"}
{"text":"Three of us enjoyed our rolls and sushi( no spicy sauce) we'll be back for more fresh fish."}
{"text":"Pure has a fabulous happy hour! The Yellowfin Ahi and Avocado Poke appetizer is a must get. The sweet potato fries that come with the sliders are also great. Both rolls we ordered (pure crunch roll & fire dragon roll) have been my favorite that I've had so far in Scottsdale. Prices are amazing & they have HH 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Great Sushi - Just moved here from LA and it took a few times to find a sushi place to love. My Favorites are the Lollipop rolls, which are rolled in cucumber instead of rice and the King Crab roll.   Love it!"}
{"text":"We had so many happy hour rolls and they were all so tasty. The tempura shrimp roll was my favorite with the eel sauce. The spicy tuna and the salmon rolls were tasty too. Great service and very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious! Fabulous service. Best Asian pear martini you could ever dream of having, Quite a gem of a place. Enjoy the out of this world happy hour"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about Pure Sushi. We did have a good visit, the waitress was pleasant. Service was good, but not exceptional, nor terrible either.   We came mainly for the happy hour menu, and the soft shell crab we saw on Yelp. They no longer have soft shell crab as a regular item, but were able to give us the soft shell crab with a nice baby green salad for $14. I can say $14 is a little steep for any soft shell crab and should be executed perfectly for that price. I would say at best this crab was $8 soft shell crab. The batter was a little heavy hiding the true deliciousness of it.   The happy hour items were surprisingly decent for their prices, and would probably only recommend this place if you are coming for their happy hour. The Korean BBQ Pork Ribs were delicious. I found the Sliders a little too sweet and over sauced (both came with huge piles of shoestring fries, we preferred the sweet potato ones to the regular ones).   The Pure Crunch roll was good, but not exceptional; we preferred the creamy baked lobster roll. The edamame was good. The Shrimp tempura was good, but only included three pieces with a giant bowl of sauce (I'm really not sure why they give so much sauce for so few shrimp).   We also ordered two peach iced teas, which were good, but completely unsweetened. The bill came to about $50 before tip. The softshell crab definitely brought the price up, otherwise it would be a fairly reasonable meal.   The main reason I'm giving this place three stars is that nothing really stood out as exceptional and that the regular menu is a well a little overpriced. As I said, only come for happy hour!"}
{"text":"One of our go-to happy hour spots. But they've been sliding downhill a bit. Slashed weekend happy hours. Out of several favorite wines by the glass & surprisingly. a few other things. Stopped carrying Fave Sculpin IPA on draft & servers never seem to know what is on tap. Servers spotty- several very personable, some quite the opposite. That's making it easier to get a table now."}
{"text":"Pure is a good staple in my lunch portfolio.  I don't go here for everyday lunches with the usual work crew, but it is perfect for business lunches where you are looking for good atmosphere and somewhere you won't be rushed, or catching up with old friends in an out-of-the-way area.    I really enjoy the beno boxes, highly recommend the salmon teriyaki version--the value is actually pretty good for the amount of food you get.  I definitely leave more satisfied vs. a typical sushi lunch."}
{"text":"The desire for sushi overcame us on our stay in Scottsdale so the 4 Star Yelp ratings convinced us to try it.  The restaurant is very pretty inside very modern with uncomfortable chairs.  I love eel and soft shell crab and both were on the menu.  We picked out what we wanted and almost instantly our orders began to arrive.  I grabbed the eel first and I was a bit disappointed,it was overly fishy and seemed like it was old.  The soft shell crab was ok,but nothing to write home about.  The spicy tuna roll just ok. All in all the service was good,the sushi mediocre."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in last Sunday after I finished work, about 1:30. It was pretty empty which was nice. They have happy hour, which I didn't know from 11-6. It was awesome. We had a great meal and the bill was half of what we usually spend! By the way, the lollipop roll was AMAZING! As was everything else!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant. We have eaten at other nearby restaurants and has wanted to check it out. After reading many of the Yelp reviews, we decided to go.   The restaurant has a great atmosphere and nice decor. The staff was friendly and prompt. We felt that the sushi rolls were over priced and that many of the sushi pieces were small in size.   On a positive note, I also ordered the Shrimp/Tuna Sushi Bowl. It was delicious and beautifully arranged. I've included a picture of the bowl. I'd visit again and order the same bowl."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my sushi lunch. The salmon was the right temp. I don't like my sushi very cold. I ordered a cucumber martini and it was delicious. Service was very good. I also ordered the Fire Dragon Rolls and I will order it again. Just the right amount of spiciness for me. I am looking forward to returning with my hubby for happy hour. The only issue i had was the high top bar table I was at was sticky and there was rice on one of the chairs."}
{"text":"My family LOVES Pure.  They have a good happy hour and have always have great food.  My 7 year old son asks to go all the time.  We have also had multiple birthday reservations in the back room and had great experiences."}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for a while. Food is excellent & staff friendly & helpful. On a recent visit we were given a table in a two- table private room. We were soon joined by a group of abusive, drunken near do wells - the kind only Scottsdale can produce. The management was unwilling to do much about this & an excruciating remainder of supper followed. Upon leaving we noted our experience and disappointment; the manager basically denied the event & offered only a half-hearted apology - nothing else! What kind of customer service is this?   Avoid this place. Really avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi and service is very good. Great happy hour specials! My only complaint is the seating. They really need to change the seats to something other than cloth. The seats are absolutely disgusting and have food stains all over them. A restaurant should not have cloth seating. Please change this and I would give it 5 starts!"}
{"text":"** If you are a parent that thinks it is acceptable to allow your child to run amuck, please stop reading now **  I really like sushi.  I love sitting at the sushi bar, enjoying some good food and conversation.  So, when my friend suggested that we go to Pure I was looking forward to trying this new-to-me sushi spot.  What can go wrong?  A lot.  Upon arrival we were seated at the sushi bar, and immediately noticed that a boy around the age of 10 was seated alone next to us.  I wondered where his parents were (this was at night, and I thought it was strange to leave a child alone where liquor was being served), but really didn't think it would be an issue.  Mistake.  It quickly became obvious that he could not be unsupervised.  Disruptive.  Food everywhere.  Impossible to ignore.  I am not exaggerating.  Ick.  This is not McDonalds - where are his parents!?  My friend mentions this to our waitress not once, but twice.  This is when I expect one of two things to occur:   1) we would be offered different seating, or 2) a manager would ask the parents (who I realized were dining separately at the complete other end of the sushi bar - WTF?) to bring him to sit with them so as not to disturb others.  Neither of these things happened.   In the meantime, we have a pear martini (excellent), yellowtail sashimi (OK, not great) and attempted to enjoy a crabcake (blegh).  It was not fresh at all.  It tasted metallic.  Inedible.  I know what crab should taste like, and this isn't it.    Back to our young diner - my friend, realizing that this kid is a nightmare, approaches the parents to explain the situation.  Why did he have to do this?  Because nobody on the Pure staff would step up to deal with it.  At this point I am very irritated (and hungry!).  Oh, it gets better.  My exasperation is interpreted by my friend as annoyance or maybe embarrassment that he spoke with the kid's parents.  No, no, no.  I cannot explain this for some reason and now everyone is aggravated.  Oh joy.  The waitress chooses this moment to offer to bring us something else to replace the crabcake, but I was pretty much over the whole experience at that point.  Scary kid, creepy food, my friend is annoyed with me and I really just want to leave.  I cannot get my credit card out quickly enough.  Get me out of here - that year-old hot pocket that is lingering somewhere in the back of my freezer is sounding pretty good right now.  Our waitress was extremely apologetic, and didn't charge me which I thought was nice (thus additional star).  However, some things you can't make up for.  Pure, you left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Great Sushi...best I've had in Phoenix.  The cost was fairly significant, but the taste was worth it.  The service also left something to be desired (even sitting at the bar).  I'd go back again on a special occasion."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that good. I ordered a bloody mary which was not drinkable so i left without drinking it and nobody asked if it was okay or why i didnt drink it or if i wanted something else. Same story with the food - no one asked if we enjoyed the food or if everything was okay. Overall the customer service was terrible. I would rank the sushi a 5/10. You would at least think they would be more friendly when you're spending $100 on sushi for two people."}
{"text":"Real nice place very modern not as authentic as some of the sushi. The fish is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Took the family for happy hour. They have the best prices and decent quality. Full salmon rolls for $3 HH prices. My kids ate 5 of them. Reminds us of Stingray and since their Scottsdale Quarter location closed this will replace it. Not the closest to home but well worth it. All day HH on Sunday too. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Good sushi, delicious Japanese noodles, and an interesting cocktail menu. Come here for the food and enjoy the atmosphere. It's a bit pricey if you're just looking for a sushi restaurant, but once you're inside, you'll see why you're paying a bit more than a local sushi joint."}
{"text":"Was here for NYE and my birthday celebration, bf explained it was my bday upon making reservation.  It was a little more casual than expected but that was fine.  Server Laura, with long blonde hair and big silver circle earrings took her time getting us started.  We ordered a bottle of champagne on the menu and she said I don't know if we have that.  Then she proceeded to flip through our menu on the table to see what they had, clearly unfamiliar with their offerings.  Hmm. NYE you would think you would know what bubbly you have..just sayin'.....She then brought a tiny bottle of sparkling sake and my bf politely asked, \"Um, is that champagne?\"  She looked at it then realizing her mistake, rushed off to get what we ordered and said it was my mistake and the bar's.  We started with a tuna and poke appetizer which was good, it had truffle oil and served on tortilla chips which was a nice crunchy contrast.  The sauce was really sweet and almost too much as you could barely taste the truffle oil even though you could smell it.  Next the tuna in the spicy tuna roll was brown(?) and not spicy, must have been with a mild soy sauce, and accompanied by only cucumber inside.  This was my least favorite.  The rainbow roll was good and what we expected, albacore sashimi was good but not the best I have had.  Sunshine roll had tuna with a mango sauce that was a refreshing fruit sauce to the palate since most of our rolls were sweet, salty, and or creamy/rich.  The baked scallop roll was okay, too much mayo in the overcooked scallops and was drenched in eel sauce.  The creamy baked lobster roll was the best, with lobster tempura on top of the roll with eel sauce.  Lobster was cooked just right.    I really wanted a lava cake for my bday but she said they were out which was disappointingly surprising since it was early, like 9:30 ish.  So we said we didn't need anything else (code for \"you can bring the check\")  but still waited for the bill. No luck so I put my coat on as a hint. Still nothing so we started looking around as a sign and even had bf put his bright red debit on the table for her to see...still waiting.  Finally had bf take his card to her.  Sub par service considering the restaurant was not even full and she clearly wasn't busy.  Food was good but not memorable.  Service below average and unlikely to return.  She never even wished me happy birthday."}
{"text":"First time having sushi in the desert I was a little worried! I was surprised! Great chefs super fun atmosphere and great food! I'll come back"}
{"text":"Pure is all about ambiance. Sushi \"purists\" will look elsewhere. The decor is modern, trendy and Scottsdale scene-esque. The food is decent (yet pricey) but if you're looking for authenticity and quality you'll need to go somewhere that doesn't invest all their money into the non-edible stuff."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place - the ambiance, the service and freshness of the food. All three times I've been here I've experienced consistency, which is very important for me.  You can't go wrong with their bento lunch boxes. I've had the beef and chicken, and they're both so sooo good and very well-served.  Their prices are reasonable considering you're getting the whole package - fresh food, great portions, good service and a nice location.  Definitely my favorite sushi place in the valley."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Pure Sushi several times, mostly the Happy Hour menu which is a real bargain.  However, decided to try new items and wow, how about the seaweed salad and baked yellow tail cheeks.  The shrimp tempura is excellent.  Can't go wrong eating there.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Ric's Body & Paint crew & myself would like to give a HUGE shout out to Pure Sushi!! This sushi is the best in the valley! We had two large trays of varieties of sushi and not one bite was left over! The Sushi was fresh, well made and delicious! This will definitely be our Go-To sushi place. Thank you so much Phil!  -Ric's Body & Paint"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Pure Sushi. Since I live close, thought I'd give it a shot. First, the hostess acted like I was putting her out when I asked to be seated at the sushi bar. She also did not give me a happy hour menu/order sheet. The waitress was helpful in getting me the right menu and was attentive throughout my visit. I ordered a spicy yellowtail roll and a dragon roll. The dragon roll was ok, nothing great. The yellowtail tasted very fishy. Sushi here is definitely not fresh and actually made me horribly sick for two days. If I decide to ever eat sushi again after that experience, I'll go back to Sushi Brokers or Sumo Maya."}
{"text":"Simply: amazing.  Blown away by absolutely we ordered, there was nothing we didn't enjoy. The uni here is ESPECIALLY delicious - probably the best I've had to date (I'm drooling now just thinking about it!)   Sitting at the sushi bar also provided us with some personal recommendations from the chefs, and some entertaining conversation. The chefs were incredibly personable, and well educated on their sushi.  Highly, HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"Midweek dinner.  Convenient location and nice outdoor seating area (hello, it's Scottsdale) with heaters for shoulder season.  Or off season. But, I digress.   Not very busy on a Tuesday, so we were seated immediately.  We chose outside, not that it matters to the review.  But maybe a bit.    We ordered miso soup and edamame (yes, I know, how cliche) for our first course, and then an assortment of nigiri, including unagi and an unagi roll.  The only reason for going into such detail is that the unagi is served hot/warm.    Here is the reason this is four stars -- they brought all of our food in about a one minute window.  It came out fast.  Very fast.  But in reality, too fast.    As for quality -- very interesting take on miso soup -- but good.  And all of the fish was fresh and very good.  Except for the pacing (or failure at it), the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"I love this place! The location is super close to both work/home and they have a great happy hour. My husband and I have been a few times and even brought both sets on in-laws. Everyone agreed how delicious it was and we can't wait to come back.   As for sushi, we have tried the Rainbow Roll ($5HH), Pure Crunch Roll ($5HH), and Fire Dragon Roll ($6HH). The Fire Dragon Roll has to be my favorite with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumbers, jalapenos, and spicy poke sauce. Every time I order it, I wish I had ordered more since everyone likes it so much. I would highly recommend it!  We have tried almost all of their appetizers. The edamame ($1.5HH) were so delicious we had to order three of them. The pork gyoza ($3HH) are amazing and come with a tasty dipping sauce. The shrimp tempura ($4HH) are good but you only get three - which aren't really a great HH deal. The sliders ($4) are delicious - pulled pork with Korean BBQ sauce and served with coleslaw and fries. Two sliders come to an order, but with the fries, it's really filling. Last, but not least, the Korean BBQ pork ribs ($7HH) are amazing. These babies are super tender and fall right off the bone. They also come with fries.   If that isn't enough for you, they also have some delicious miso soup. Not on the happy hour menu, but still tasty and worth it.   Overall, a great sushi place. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ambiance very nice, but the food was OK at best.  I would have given it three stars, but when you take the price (very high) into consideration, it just isnt worth it.  Nothing bad, just not worth $60 for lunch.  Very, very average taste and we ordered the signature rolls.  There are dozens of sushi places in Phoenix where you can get sushi at least as good as Pure for half the cost.  One more thing - the maguro was pretty low quality - pale pink in color as opposed to the bright red that you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber (or at least this price)."}
{"text":"Busy eatery in a retail shopping area.  The inside was packed for happy hour on a Saturday.  Our group opted to sit outside on the patio.  The service was friendly and fast.  We had an assortment from the happy hour food choices, beer & wine,  everything was delicious, including the side of shoestring sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"I was driving around the other day and noticed Pure Sushi and remember thinking I am going to have to try that place out! Thankfully, I didn't have to wait long at all! A friend and I were looking for a place to check out for dinner and we both wanted sushi so I suggested we check out Pure Sushi over our usual joints. The decor inside is appealing, and very minimal, lots of white!  Service was fantastic throughout our entire meal, our waitress was really on top of things was helpful and friendly.   The two stand out items of the entire meal was the Fire Dragon Roll which has shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and cucumber inside, fresh tuna with cilantro and jalapeno on top, served with spicy poke sauce. It's fresh and flavorful and the spicy poke sauce with the cilantro and jalapeño really brings it over the top!  They have amazing happy hour specials from 3-6pm Monday through Friday and 11-6pm on Saturday and Sundays. I have heard amazing things about their poke and sea bass so those are my next must try items!   I def can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I am blown away this place has a 4 star rating. What a total misrepresentation!  Felt like I was at an overpriced Teharu."}
{"text":"Their nigiri salmon is delicious, fresh and has no fishy taste.  I love that they add wasabi under the fish. I have eaten the Sea Bass, that is flaky warm and tasty, some of the best I've had.  I've never eaten anything I didn't love.  Their tempura udon is also awesome.  The servers here are wonderful, and love to make conversation.  The best time to go is Happy Hour, they have great sushi and appetizer deals.  I \"heart\" Pure Sushi."}
{"text":"Pure used to be our favorite place, but after our most recent experience, we will never be stoping in again. We showed up at 1:40p on a Sunday. It took about 5 minutes for someone to tell us \"sit wherever you want\" and then not even have someone pour us water until 15 minutes later. After another 10 minutes of not having anyone acknowledge that we were there we decided to leave. The man (who looked like he was in charge) didn't even say anything as we walked out the door. We told him why we were leaving, but he didn't even respond. It was truly a shame. We went to Sushi Brokers instead and had a fabulous experience."}
{"text":"so today i had my first pure sushi lunch, i was right by there on my lunch break & ordered two california rolls to go.. The place looked very modern, very nice.. the staff was super nice, and the whole place gave me a good vibe. My california rolls were delicious. this place is somewhere i will definately keep going to."}
{"text":"Great food! Our server Is amazing! Love the atmosphere and definitely recommend the chicken katsu!"}
{"text":"We came here for Father's Day and waited 40 minutes for our food. We ordered drinks along with the chicken katsu, salmon sashimi, salmon/tuna nigiri, and the king crab roll. It took them an hour to begin making the king crab roll which seemed a bit ridiculous. Although the drinks were very good, the food and prices were definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The salad and sushi was wonderful! We are visiting so some friends recommended pure sushi. The coconut shrimp is really good to start with. Very intimate and cozy setting."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this neighborhood sushi restaurant pretty much twice a week . We are treated like family!  The Happy Hour is a tremendous value. This is our home away from home !  The salmon poke bowl is a favorite. Great dragon roll ..  The best is feeling like family every time we visit !"}
{"text":"Chilean Sea Bass! Melt in your mouth delicate deliciousness........had to update! Oh and for dessert Chocolate Mochi Icecream.....a truely tasty and original dessert."}
{"text":"One of our favorite sushi restaurants and a great happy hour. Servers are knowledgeable.   The outside patio is nice."}
{"text":"I went alone to Pure Sushi being new to Scottsdale,   this place needs warmer friendlier hostesses that understand a single diner doesn't want to sit at table for 4 right by front door,  the sushi bar or cocktail lounge would always be better.  And this is what I requested.  She asked me why I was there....to eat....duh. Very unprofessional.   Then she asked me how many people.....hummmm came in alone and told her table for one.  Sushi chef was friendly and chatted a little.  I'll go back but I will mention something if I'm greeted this way again.  Happy Hour pricing is pretty good.  Pretty good wine list."}
{"text":"Have been frequenting Pure since it opened.  Food is exceptional.  Service is either great or meh.  This is a fine place for Sushi fans as well as folks like me who prefer cooked food, LOL.  Pretty presentation and cool ambiance.  It's not a very big place, (although there is an attached patio dining area) so it's crowded in Season...but so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Pure is, unfortunately, my new sushi place. This blows because it's all the way out in the boonies, for chrissakes. It's on, like, 923875987235th street and Hayden (no offense, Kristen.).  So, there's that. BUT! They are expanding to Old Town, which only puts them 4 light years away from me, as opposed to 17. Woo-hoo!  I'm complainy right now because of all the boozy bowling last night with you yelpers, FYI.  At any rate, try the Veggie Tempura... it's absolutely out of this world dreamy. It's very light, and they don't deep fry the whole veggie, they actually julienne everything, make it into little birds nest thingies, then fry it. They also add a clump of mashed daikon sprouts to the tempura so you can digest the oil better.   Our server, Jenna, was just AWESOME and gave us some great pointers on the more uncommon effects of Sea Urchin. Hooray for aphrodisiacs. We also had this lobster roll thing with a sweet cream and tempura lobster. SO GOOD.  The prices were really great, I thought. Less pricey than Stingray.  Jew mom also gave it big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We usually love pure sushi, and usually have pretty good service. We decided to order take out, on the phone they told me it would be 30 minutes, not a problem-but 30 minute later we show up and have to wait an additional 30 minutes. And the customer service was they worst we have encountered.  A normal day I'd give this place a 4/5 stars, but customer arrive is very important to me and unfortunately we may not go back"}
{"text":"I take out from here all the time. Great Bento Boxes for lunch, and awesome happy hour menu. The Fire Dragon rolls are my favorite, as well as the Sashimi Platter. The atmosphere is cool and contemporary, great for a date evening or lunch with friends. The service is good too!"}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi. California rolls and shrimp tempura rolls are excellent. Quick service."}
{"text":"Last night was a disaster at Pure, they were busy and short-staffed (only 2 sushi chefs). The man working Expo was a total jerk to the chefs constantly yelling and making rude comments loud enough for customers to hear.  This was a regular place we enjoyed going but now will think twice about visiting again.  When we asked why there were only 2 chefs we were told that our favorite chef EJ was in an auto accident which alarmed us - fortunately we had his contact information so immediately texted to make sure he was ok only to find out he quit the job and didn't get into an accident (thank goodness).  The rolls we ordered came out ugly and loosely rolled - the sushi chef even apologized as he was handing them to us.  It was not a good night at Pure - something needs to change."}
{"text":"Salmon skin hand roll was tasty.  Also ordered a sashimi dinner plate and a SeaBass on forbidden rice.  Several mistakes were made during the evening.   1. Out of the fish, offered a different fish but forgot to place the order. 2. Brought some kind of sushi roll instead of sashimi dinner plate. 3. Waited for the fish entree while watching companion eat his sashimi dinner when it finally came. The food was not bad and ambience was ok.  Just need to work on the service level."}
{"text":"First time here over the weekend. Service was decent. Our bartender was nice and welcoming. He was knowledgeable about the menu as well as the sakes available at his bar.  We found ourselves waiting around a bit while our sushi sat to be ran to our table...knew it was ours due to only one other couple being in the restaurant. I didn't like the Miso soup. It was loaded with mushrooms as opposed to being garnished. The soft shell crab appetizers was really good and a dish I will definitely get again.  The manager was there and shared some \"one ofs\" for remaining Scotch.   Overall experience was good, food was good and people were nice."}
{"text":"Loving this place! Fresh fish, creative sashimi dishes. Gotta try to Hamachi Spoons next visit. Must haves: the coconut shrimp, spring rolls, ahi and avocado poke, and definitely the baked sea bass!!"}
{"text":"I have reviewed Pure in the past. I do make a point of giving a restaurant a second chance to make a good impression, unfortunately Pure continues to strike out.  We stopped in for Happy Hour last week. After a variety of average-at-best Sushi, rolls and wine we received our bill and were surprised the prices were higher than we expected. I pulled the Pure website up and saw that the prices on the Happy Hour menu online were lower than the prices on our bill. I brought the discrepancy to the waitress who then engaged the manager. There was no explanation for the difference, no apology from the manager, just an instruction to the waitress to adjust our check.  How many other people have looked at Pure online, and then gone and paid a bill of higher prices without realizing they had been scammed? We have given Pure a couple of chances to prove they can deliver a good quality product and a good price. Unfortunately I think this price gouging is a little sleazy. We will never be back!"}
{"text":"I have never seen/had the creamy lobster roll at any other sushi place-I'm glad I tried it. The battered lobster and cream sauce on top was a unique combination. The ambiance was classy without being stuffy. The weather was great for the patio. We got there early at 4:00pm, and had great service. The crowd started showing up as we were leaving though"}
{"text":"I'd like to write a review of this place, but the thing is I have no clue how the food is. After seeing the decent ratings and the fact that my last two favorite sushi places have shut down I decided to get dressed really cute and my boyfriend and I left around 3 this afternoon to try out the happy hour. Whenever we go to a new restaurant we like to sample a lot of different things and happy hour always helps because prices are lower. So we drive the half hour south and arrive at Pure. There were two groups of people sitting inside, and the patio looked nice so we decided to sit out there. After five minutes or so a waiter brought out waters (which a fly landed on the rim of my glass not a split second after it was put on the table, I know they can't control the outside insects but it was still gross!) so when I wanted some water I drank my bf's. I asked our waiter if the happy hour was only at the bar or if we could order off it outside as well and his response went a little something like this... \"ummmmm, uhhhhh, welllllll we don't have happy hour here, that was at our south location and they ummm closed, we haven't updated our website yet to say that but yeah, we don't do happy hour.\" I was shocked. The fact that only one of their locations did happy hour should have been written on the website in the first place. They are LYING to get business, and have hungry people show up only to find they have to pay $15 for a roll. No thanks. We aren't cheap eaters by any means, but we draw the line at false advertising. Thanks for the bad water."}
{"text":"Hung out during happy hour with \"Jules\", who made us feel at home, turned us onto some new cocktails and we all had fun.  By far one of the more expensive sushi restaurants, but that might have had to do with our huge appetite and dozens of drinks.  A great spot for sushi, and beautiful all white decor.  Although I can't imagine how much the janitor's life sucks keeping it clean."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday after church at about 1130ish. I walked in and was told I could sit anywhere. I chose to sit at the bar because I was by myself. The waitress that helped me was great. They have a happy hour menu for Sunday's and the same one for certain hours during the week. On the happy hour menu select rolls, appetizers, and alcoholic beverages are cheaper. I asked my waitress what she recommended and of the 3 recommendations she gave me I chose the Fire Dragon Roll. It was delicious! If you don't like a lot of heat (spice) then I don't recommend this for you. I also ordered edamame with my roll. The only complaint I had was that there was quite a bit of salt on the edamame. Overall I had a great experience and pleased with the happy hour prices. This might become my after church ritual!"}
{"text":"Great food and service however the owners need to check the kitchen ventilation system as every time you're there, you leave smelling like the fry oil !! We really like Pure however we've had to opt to sitting outside only."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi in town.  The place is always great.  Happy Hour menu has some awesome values.  The same bar tenders have been their for years and remember you and your likes.  Every time I go somewhere else for sushi I always say, \"should have gone to Pure...\""}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  This used to be our neighborhood sushi stop.  Not anymore.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"In the world of sushi these guys are just ok. Way to expensive for the quality. Service generally sucks. There are too many other options. Stick to the rolls. For real such go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We used to be big fans of Pure with a visit approx 3x a month.  At one point a couple years ago, the food service and quality became, for lack of a better term, lazy.  Periodically we return to see if things have changed.  Last night returned for the first time in about a year and unfortunately found not much has changed.  They somehow have moved away from a more classy menu to this big plastic sheet.  Makes me think of being at chillis..... In addition there was some sticky stuff on the menu which I wasn't to pleased about avoiding.  We started with the pork dumplings.  They were loose, a little cold and a tasted as though they had been sitting around for some time.  This is curious because we received them about 2 minutes after they were ordered.  The more important part for us is the sushi itself.   We had:   Pinwheel.... Sloppily put together.  Fish was extremely thick. Tuna, yellowtail, seabass nigiri.  Everything was warm and we believed the sushi was not cut right it somehow seemed hard, lacking of the proper texture and simply did not taste fresh.  The server was very good by the way.  For our money ,we will stick with stingray and probably try pure again in another year.  I imagine they plan to be around since they committed to the great expense of plastic menus."}
{"text":"First, I have to say I don't tend to write a review unless I like the place, but this place was just bad. It is waaaaay overpriced, even for sushi! The service was not so great, the waitresses seemed way too cool to be taking care of us. The sushi I would say was good, but not great. I had one roll the was really good, the rest were middle of the road. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Good happy hour. We always sit at the bar and chat with the ever amusing Lara. I love the rice-free rolls. The Lollipop roll made with real crab (no crab mix/mayo) is THE best. Last night we were starving at 3pm after moving all day, so we stopped in for happy hour appetizers. Awesome deals. I had a HUGE plate of the Yellowfin and Ahi Tuna Poke for $6 I think. It kept me full until dinner at 8pm. BF had the Shrimp Tempura roll, BF's mom had the California roll. Pretty standard choices, but great as always. No reason to sit at a table here -- the bar has it all and we can even watch the game! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Overpriced sushi place in N Scottsdale. We went in for dinner with the family and there was a lot of issues with the food and service.  A few other guests were also complaining. The sushi was well below par for the prices and everything was slow. The kids used the chop stick trainers and liked them, so that's one good takeaway."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Had three rolls. A lobster roll, spicy ahi and tempura and a third can't remember the name but on the happy hour list. All we're great.   Good ribs and pot stickers also.   The staff helped push this to a 5star for opening a fresh bottle of wine for me when I was drinking by the glass."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi in the area... They didn't have \"Inari\" or even know what it was, but their sushi was fresh, delish, and not OTT pricey. Def has become our \"go to\" sushi restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"This place had some great sushi and sashimi selection. Ordered a vegas roll, it was great. The squid, salmon, sweet shrimp and scallop sushi was great too quite fresh but chef could do a better job in fish cutting. Sushi rice was too much and too mushy. Wine selection were limited but had variety of drinks. Lastly sweet shrimp head was fried but was inside. Biggest disappointment of the night."}
{"text":"I popped in here during happy hour, and at that time the appetizers menu is very affordable. The service was excellent. The food is very nicely prepared and if you are into the 'fusion scene', probably exactly what you are seeking. The real wasabi was excellent, and the wasabi mayo drizzle was an interesting and tasty touch.The korean BBQ ribs were great. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"YUM!  This place is great.  The In & Out roll was our favorite but the Chicken Teriyaki and fried rice were awesome as well.  Wish we were in town longer as we would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Delightful experience! I came in with my 2 little ones alone. Jay was our waiter, and a very good one. He got the chefs to prepare their sunsine roll with orange and passionfruit dressing, because I am highly allergic to mango. He was very accomodating. I also had the seared tuna tataki, which was also excellent. My kids had miso soup and their fried rice; both were very good. I was very surprised that a strip mall sushi joint would be thay delicious. Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"We came here after a football game. My son was having a craving for Japanese. So we found Pure Sushi on Yelp.   Walked in and it was pretty busy. Luckily they had one table available inside and we took it. Place is very modern looking. Little elegance to it with white curtains. Almost everything white.   My son ordered the miso soup and surprised he thought that it was really good. He then ordered the chicken teriyaki. It was basically a breast of chicken that requires a knife and fork. He didn't complain about it and ate it all up.   My wife ordered the Nabeyaki Udon which was basically a seafood Udon soup. It had shrimp, shrimp tempura, scallops. Soup was really good. Noodles nice a fresh. So she liked it and I was able try some too and have to say it was good.   This is the problem I have with this place. If you know me I really hate to complain but this is just unacceptable. Both my wife and son are really slow eaters and usually takes them a good 30 minutes to eat. Saying this I ordered the eel and avocado bowl and we ordered the baked scallop roll too.   Both my son and wife finished their meal and I didn't get my dinner or our appetizers of the baked scallops roll. Our waitress apologized a few times and then had to get the manger. I was basically eating my wife's leftovers cause I was starving.   The manager apologized but came up with some lame excuses that they had 30 sushi orders but when he told me this half the tables were already gone. So don't know how this could be a valid excuse. He also said the hot dishes and sushi kitchen was so busy but then how did they get my son and wife order out as a hot dish but miss mine. So his excuses was a joke. I was so mad that I told him I just want the bill for what my family ate and I will go to Panda Express.   He told me no but he actually took off the eel avocado bowl and baked scallop roll from my bill. The least he could do. It actually came out pretty quickly after my conversation with the manager.   Seriously, 30+ minutes for a eel and avocado bowl. It was basically rice with slices of avocado on top of a nice piece of eel. It had a scoop of crab mix on top. Nothing special and plus my mood was ruined.   The baked scallop roll was actually put in the oven. Plate was really hot. Didn't look like scallops on the sushi. Looked more like clams but what do I know. Anyways, it was okay.   So I can't really blame it on the waitress. She did a good job taking care of our table by filling up or glasses. Again the kitchen was terrible. Screwing up my order. Making me wait 30 plus minutes and giving me all these lame excuses. Unacceptable   Not a place I want to visit again. There are too many Japanese and sushi places to visit. It might have been one time but 30+ minutes. Never again  Oh yea should have given them a one or two star review but up it one star cause he took my meal and our sushi off the bill."}
{"text":"Sushi was not that great . Got two specialty rolls .. Waitress was very good until Her' end .. We just started eating .. Probably going to order more.. And she gave us the check cuz she was going on break .. Very unprofessional and rude. Will not be going back ..the people giving this place good reviews do not know good sushi !"}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite sushi spots in scottsdale. If I'm craving sushi this is my first happy hour spot. There deals and prices for the quality of fish you get is unbeatable. From the sushi to drinks, all is amazing. My favorite drink is there cucumber gin martini. Servers are the only down side as they seem a little unprofessional or disengaged with their job. They also have a ton of young staff always hanging around the bathroom/ kitchen area doing nothing. This seems slightly weird and makes for overcrowding. Overall, this is a great spot for a sushi craving. I LOVE that there happy is till 6 on Saturday's!!"}
{"text":"I came here after reading through the yelp reviews hoping to have some great sushi.... Unfortunately this was not the case. As I sit here at 9pm after eating at pure sushi I feel disappointed and dissatisfied. Rice was way too sticky. Fish was stale. Service was ok. Would not return. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to meet my girlfriend before our facials and or mani/pedi! Awesome happy hour with a variety of appetizers. Sushi is good for a quick fix. The only thing I could say is that the edamame never seems fresh and is over cooked, but otherwise, love the service and food is good! Perfect for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon delight!"}
{"text":"For this neighborhood, I had high expectations for this place!  The surrounding area has a lot of really good places.  We ordered the Ahi Tuna appetizer which had a weird flavor and the accompanying chips were stale.  ten sushi roll (I think it was the Vegas) wasn't fresh and tasted like it had been sitting out for a couple hours.  None of the dishes we ordered were high quality or fresh.  With so many great sushis place this was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in the valley.  I am glad it is near home.  Love the Poke here (not authentic - but they put a delicious spin on it)!  The sashimi is always fresh (sometimes a challenge for AZ sushi places).  I enjoy maki wrapped in cucmber and they have a few really good choices here for those.  Happy Hour is a steal and I like the Korean BBQ pork sliders a lot (which I hate to admit ordering these at a sushi restaurant with such great sushi).    My only negative is service can be hit or miss, even within a meal.  In this case, super attentive until dinner was served and then no water or drink service for quite a while.  We would have stayed a while and ordered more beers and drinks after dinner, but we decided to leave since it would have taken a while."}
{"text":"Love this place. Close to home. Service and atmosphere is always great.  Happy hour menu is limited but good choices and value. My favorites are the \"Crunch\" and \"Fire Dragon\" rolls.  I typically go around 4 o'clock to beat the crowds.  Never disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place on the weekend because they offer a great happy hour menu between 11am-6pm. The best appetizers are Yellowfin Ahi and Avocado Poke, Lettuce Wraps, and the Pork Gyoza, I order their salmon rolls (both regular and spicy) and rainbow rolls most of the time as well. Nothing particularly fancy but I think tastes great and can't beat the price ($3 and $4).  I don't go to this place unless it's happy hour because I think it is expensive and not worth the money for what you're getting...so check the time!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick bite after work, great rolls and service. Will defining be back!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I do like Pure's sushi, however, their service is really subpar despite this trying economy. Last weekend, a buddy and I went to the restaurant where we were greeted by a cute hostess who made us wait for 20 minutes with available tables in sight. We were then seated on the patio at the only table without a space heater. From there, we sat staring at each other for an additional 25 minutes without a greeting from any of Pure's staff members who glided past us with smiles on their faces and plates and plates of food. Finally fed up, we grabbed a busboy who brought a manager to our table. He played his whole shocked and embarrassed card, but in the end offered nothing for our trouble other than, \"Can I get you something now?\" What a joke! I used to like Pure, but I certainly don't have any plans on going back, at least not to the North Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"The sushi here is REALLY good. The fish is tender and the service was great. Our food came out fast and the ambiance is wonderful too. Loved my experience and will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi! I was on vacation in Phoenix, and wanted sushi... went here and was not disappointed! The sushi was really good. I thought the prices were very fair. Everyone was super friendly. Would recommend if you're looking for great sushi in this area!"}
{"text":"So happy there is a new owner. They changed a few things and made it a lot more enjoyable! New fun things on the menu great Sushi chefs (DJ is awesome). Love the changes and a happy place to be. Weekly visit if not more! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Pure Sushi is Pure Sensation!   I came here for restaurant week with a classmate, and I must say:   One of the Best sushi Places in Az.   I'm not one to give 5 stars unless its a Yelp Party that I'm going to, but this place definitely deserves it. The place truly delivers.   Favorite part of the meal:  Ahi & Avocado Poke - Fresh ahi & avocado w/truffle infused veg & taro chips   Next fave: Sashimi-Nigiri plate - three types of sashimi & two nigiri   Do not order again, ever:  Mochi Plate - Japanese ice cream balls covered in sweet rice paste   The mochi plate was not even soft -- it was hard, like freezer burn awful.  Despite the mishap on the mochi ice cream, I loved the place. I'll have to come back again for happy hour. Also notable dishes was the Fire Dragon Roll.  What to get again: Anything that is fresh fish. It is a rare find to find sushi so fresh and so delightful. Come for the fresh fish!"}
{"text":"My Favorite Sushi Spot! Their Happy Hour is AMAZING & I always feel like we get great service."}
{"text":"Pure is a beautiful restaurant with exceptional service and wonderful Japanese food and sushi. Great appetizers are ribs, edamame, miso soup, and calamari. Their rolls  are a little pricey, but they offer happy hour prices so definitely check that out. We've also had their tempura vegetable dinner and their salmon dinner as well as bento boxes at lunchtime and all are great. If you want great tasting, clean, sumptuous Japanese food/sushi in a beautiful environment, try Pure."}
{"text":"Wow, visitied last evening after reading reviews on yelp for tuna poke. Excellent, excellent sushi for fair price in Scottsdale area. Would be 5 stars except came in around 8:30 and restaurant closed at 9,  servers wanted to go home and we were rushed. Food tho, excellent. Will try again during week, but they are not late night on Sunday, lol, and they let you know."}
{"text":"Well, you all were right !! Sushi Delicioso! Went for happy hour and it was way better than I expected. The Crunch Roll is the bomb! Ill have 2 next time, and was so good I am going back Friday. Beautiful atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff . ***** starz from me Fresh n delicious"}
{"text":"Good sushi, pretty attentive wait staff, and a nice patio.  The sushi was good, but wasn't amazing. Granted, we mostly are off of the happy hour menu, so it was more reasonably priced.  We did have some challenges finding a dessert that they had in stock and they completely forgot my dessert in the confusion.  I would definitely go again, but probably only during happy hour."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of this place for a long time.  Recently though, the service has really declined and the quality has been inconsistent.  The last two times I went our order was very messed up.  When we talked with the manager he acted as if it was our fault... very strange.  I suspect if they don't get their service sorted out they will share same fate as Stingray."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delicious lunch on the recommendation from Amber at The Sheraton. We started with a seafood salad and a crunchy roll. My husband really enjoyed his salad with the ahi and salmon and octopus and the side of spicy poke sauce. I loved my crunchy roll with siracha sauce on it. The best treat was the salmon jaw. It was absolutely delicious. The skin was so crispy and we put teriyaki and siracha sauce on it. Try it you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Pure Sushi was pretty good - My wife really likes this joint a lot.  I thought it was a little overpriced, myself.  I definitely recommend the tuna sashimi and the Fire Dragon Roll."}
{"text":"Despite seating available inside we were given outside seating, the same seating was still open as we finished up.  One of the two heaters was not working and the working one stopped halfway through dinner. The sushi was very good. I liked the Box Sushi, and the Ika was great.  Service was friendly and fairly attentive. If i could, i would give 3.5 stars rather than four."}
{"text":"It just didn't knock my socks off. Maybe I was expecting too much from some of the previous reviews but it was fairly mediocre in my book.  The restaurant itself was trendy but was nothing out the ordinary.... no memorable qualities or specific ambience.  Typical swanky/ expensive sushi place.    The waitstaff was definitely subpar.  Two different servers asks for our orders and it was apparent that they were as confused as we were and that no one was terribly organized.    The sushi was good, just not fantastic.  The rolls and menu options were very standard. Overall I think there are better sushi places out there to try, especially for the price tag."}
{"text":"Had an extended family happy our at Pure Sushi last week. It was fun! We sat on the patio and the space was wonderful. Very cool decor as well.   With all those folks who have differing ideas on food, we didn't do our typical sushi thing & didn't actually order. Had a bunch of the specialty rolls. I tried the crunchy roll, sakesake roll, potato spicy tuna roll & some yakotori. Everything was tasty. Of all that I tried, I definitely liked the sakesake roll best (spicy crab mix, cucumber & asparagus inside, fresh salmon & sweet onions on top served with some sort of apple sauce - not that apple sauce). It was good. The potato spicy tuna roll was interesting as well with sweet chili sauce and fried julienne potatoes on top.  Think I missed the albacore ceviche roll which I heard was quite good. Definitely some other interesting looking items on the menu as well.  The one criticism that I'd mention was that the service, while quite nice, was very slow and they were not crazy busy or anything.  I'd definitely like to go back & try some other funky items & their more traditional sushi but it'll probably have to wait until someone else organizes a visit. Hard for us to put it ahead of the more traditional style places we love."}
{"text":"We made reservations online for 5:30 seeming it was a Friday night and most places are packed at the time we wanted to go. The place was a little hard to find since it was in a weird area and the trees were covering the sign but we found it. The place is actually quite small but I saw people walking in and out of a back area so i'm assuming there was more seating back there. We had a table and at first it was wiggling but a waiter came over to fix it by putting something underneath a leg so I appreciated that since it annoyed me it was wiggling. The seat I sat on was super squishy like I was sitting on a sofa almost, which I didn't really like. It wasn't loud at all, which was a plus. The menu is a little pricey but I assumed the food better be damn good for it to be that much. Our waitress was nice, she checked up on us to do refills and ask how we liked the good, which I appreciated instead of being ignored. Now the food. My mom and I got sushi. We ordered the avocado roll, the spicy tuna roll and the fire dragon roll. We had to wait about 15 minutes which wasn't too bad. The Fire Dragon Roll was $15. When we got the food I was very disappointed. There was about 6 rolls for the avocado roll and 8 for the spicy tuna roll which was normal, I wasn't upset about that at all. Now, the fire dragon roll, there was ONLY 5 pieces for it. Like are you kidding me?! $15 for 5 pieces! Ridiculous! Way over priced for the quantity you get. It should have came with at LEAST 8 not 5. That's really expensive for the amount. I could go to Sushi Brokers and get probably 9 pieces of sushi for $15. I suggest you either lower the prices because of the amount you get or add more rolls to the items because it is way overpriced. I would give this place 3/5 stars but the customer service was great but the amount of sushi we got knocked a star off."}
{"text":"Super nice manager Brett who was incredibly accommodating to my friend and I when we wanted to change tables. Fish was fresh and delicious, and the sushi chefs are very entertaining to watch as well. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great service!! Great bartenders! Love Josie and Danielle!  We had everything on the Happy hour menu and it was amazing and reasonably priced! Josie makes a mean Old Fashion!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi establishments I've ever been to. Quick sushi chefs, quality specials, & clean atmosphere.    Highlights during my visit was the Spanish Bluefin Tuna which was perfectly marbled & an absolute treat as sashimi.  Also, was that they offer fresh wasabi instead of that cheap paste you find everywhere else. Nothing like fresh wasabi to take your sushi dining experience to the next level.    I'm looking forward to my next visit there to try out their next special."}
{"text":"Loved the space. Huge PURE makes one wall. The service was great. Casual but helpful. Went with their suggestion on some drinks and rolls and loved them all. More action later in the night for sure."}
{"text":"Had this been our first time here we would not ever come back. We chose to sit at a high top table in the bar area.  Note to self..... Don't sit in the bar area for dinner!  The service was terrible.  We were served by the busy bartender. And she was not excited about coming out from behind the bar. The food was good, although the ginger was course, rubbery and hard to chew.   Our order was messed up twice!  We didn't get our whole sushi order ( which was corrected), and a roll order never showed up. Both times required a get up and go to bar to inform our bartender/server.  Very disappointing to say the least.   it would probably be a good idea to have the bartender stay behind the bar and not try to be a server at the same time.   It will be awhile before we go try a do over.  Not sure I am up for another chance.   But when and if we do, we will not sit in the bar area!   The owner was too busy chatting with all of the ladies at the bar and making sure they were happy, rather than checking on other customers to see how their dining experience was.  I would have been happy to share with him.  Our first visit there was totally the opposite.  Too bad we couldn't have that repeated.  Hmm, maybe third time is a charm."}
{"text":"A hungry group of girls (most from out of town) + Pure  = Yum!  We could not have picked a more beautiful day to have lunch out on the patio at Pure. For those of you who have read some of my previous reviews, you know that sushi is not necessarily at the top of my list of lunch choices, but when in Rome.......  The atmosphere was cool and chic, but not pretentious or overbearing. Our waitress was very friendly and within minutes of sitting down, we had popped open a bottle of champagne and were toasting our resident birthday girl.  The lunch menu was extensive (and not all about the raw stuff - yay for me!) and we had a hard time deciding what to order. We finally selected the Edamame for starters, then had several of the Creamy Bake Lobster rolls (sheer perfection , I tell you!), the Shrimp Tempura roll and the Sashimi platter. I ate heartily from the Lobster and Shrimp rolls, but left the Sashimi to the hardcore sushi worshipers.   Overall, the food was 5 stars, but the service became somewhat lax throughout the meal. Our waitress was nice enough, but it appeared that she might have been overbooked with tables."}
{"text":"Pure is amazing and so is Ellie the manager who helped with catering my event last week! The food was kept fresh and hot and put out in just the right amounts. None was wasted and everyone loved the variety. I will use them again for sure at my next event!"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday and it was delicious! We got so much food for so little money with the Happy Hour deals!!  We first tried the Pork Gyoza and it was amazing!! We also got the Calamari and the sauce that came with it was sooo good!! We had the Vegetable Fried Rice as well and at this point, we were so full!! BUT we couldn't stop eating because it was all so good so we ordered some sushi rolls!!  I had the Crunchy Tempura Roll and we also tried the Spicy Tuna. Definitely preferred the Spicy Tuna with crab mix over the Shrimp Tempura Roll, but they both hit the spot! We could not finish everything- but that meant delicious left-overs!  I will definitely be back, Pure Sushi!"}
{"text":"Previously had enjoyed dining at this upscale sushi restaurant.  Disappointed with the decline in service on a Monday night.  Ordered a few sushi rolls and nigiri.  Took over 45 minutes for items to come out.  Waitress rarely checked in on us.  When we complained about the speed of service, she gave us attitude.  Better places in Scottsdale/Phoenix to spend your money and have a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Good place for real sushi. Please note I do not consider California Roll to be actual sushi. Sushi is tuna or yellowtail or salmon: anything raw. Get it with rice, get it with sauce, get it however you want. But don't tell me how you ate really good sushi the other day when you ordered California Roll.   That said I loved the In & out roll here! Also try the listed cucumber cocktail. Best cocktail I have had in Scottsdale. Very cute decor here."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  It's ironic that the name of the restaurant is \"Pure Sushi\" because in my opinion, this place is good if you are into fusion rolls...they are very creative. Ambiance is nice,  decor is trendy, but prices are a little high.   We started with the Yellowfin Ahi and Avocado Poke which had white truffle in it and was served on individual taro chips (6 I think?). While it was tasty, refreshing and had a nice presentation, the truffle flavor was a little strong for me. You cannot appreciate the yellowfin at all. We also ordered the salmon and albacore sahsimi and the ikura. Fish tasted fresh and was a pretty good cut.   We also ordered the Fire Dragon Roll and Peppered Beef Roll. I know, I know, why order beef at a sushi place? Well, it is a fusion restaurant after all. And surprisingly the beef roll was my favorite of what we tried. The mushroom, asparagus, and sesame sauce all worked really well with the peppered beef. Mmm. The fire dragon roll was definitely spicy. It was tasty but it was kind of a glorified spicy tuna roll. We went for restaurant week and I would consider coming back for happy hour if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I used to love this place been coming here for years. Pricy but always worth it. today  not so much- empty dining room one bartender/waitress. Took 10 minutes to bring waters. Sushi was far from fresh- took forever to get our check let alone acknowledge us on our meal- all around horrific just praying I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"While Jem's \"It's Amazing\" is playing overhead...I'm sipping a pear martini as well as  discovering my new favorite appetizer: Yellowfin Ahi And Avocado Poke with white truffle infused asian vegetables on crispy taro chips. Like the song, \"It's Amazing!\" Some people hear \"white truffle\" and go right to heaven at the thought...but not this girl. I seldom care for it, but absolutely found it \"done right\" with the flavors here.   We've been to \"Pure\" many-a-time both for Happy Hour and regular dining and this place keeps us coming back over the years for the friendly service, the quality of the sushi (and other items) as well as the location/ambiance and pricing. While not inexpensive, it's fair for the area as well as the portion/quality and the service has always remained professional as well as fun.  I love the interior design and prefer sitting at or near the sushi bar.   The pulled pork sliders and sweet potato fries also hit the spot as did the spicy tuna lettuce wraps. If there is one roll that I wouldn't recommend, it'd be the rainbow. Consistently, a little on the small side (compared to other sushi spots) and Pure has many other rolls that will do you better. Their Happy Hour menus has a great selection across the board. Here's the lollipop from a few years back: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pure-sushi-scottsdale?select=RTZIo6QHcJa2ElQPXz4EFQ#RTZIo6QHcJa2ElQPXz4EFQ  They take reservations and you may need them! It fills up, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Pure is my new favorite spot! GREAT food and atmosphere! I have been twice and was very pleased but be sure to make a reservation or not be in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi bar in the area.   They have a delicious Hamachi kama and excellent lunch specials.   They also have a happy hour menu which includes all day on Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"Great service and very good rolls. Good price points for very tasty food. I liked the environment and had a good time."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch.  I ordered the sashimi and sushi lunch.  The fish was not as fresh as it normally is. I have eaten here several times and the fish was always fresh and very good.  Could it be we came here towards the end of the week and the fish isn't as fresh???  However, the guest that came with me ordered the bento box and that was very good.  Miso soup was very tasty, with tofu, seaweed and mushroom.  At least the service was amazing."}
{"text":"One of my local favorites.  They take sushi rolls and do fun and interesting things I haven't seen from others.  Peppered beef roll is my favorite!!  White Cosmo's go down very smooth!  Thank goodness I can walk there.    Sushi?  Sadly I always try there salads and rolls, never really made it to the traditional sashumi"}
{"text":"Just had lunch and I have to say when it comes to quality Pure is head and shoulders above most spots in AZ.  Everything we had was fresh and of high quality.  We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, fresh sushi. Natasha is a great waitress and Hudson is the great sushi chef. They have great happy hour specials and interesting sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey but if you want good sushi you got to shell out a little. Took a friend out for dinner for one of my last nights in Scottsdale before moving back to the east coast. Started off with some delicious beverages, but decided to stay away from the saki this time. Instead started with their pear martini which hit the spot. Then my order of miso soup came. I think miso soup pretty much taste the same where ever you go, but this one stood out for its exceptional taste. Me and my friend got a variety of nigiri, handrolls, and rolls. So good we order even more pieces of nigiri for dinner after stuffing out faces. The bill was certainly on the high end for two people but a good time."}
{"text":"It's a very pretty restaurant, but until you see the bathroom, it might change your mind. I have been there a few times thinking the sushi would be better on my next visit....it is NOT.  It tastes rotten, and the rice is dried out. The servers have snotty attitudes, and the service is excruciatingly slow.    One more thing: The bathroom was FILTHY and DISGUSTING. The floor and walls and sink were so dirty, and there was dried diarrhea splatter all over the toilet. It was so unbelievably gross that I immediately ran out of the bathroom.  That is a tell-tale sign of a dirty restaurant.  I should probably call the health department.  After seeing that bathroom, I would never go back."}
{"text":"Very good, moderately priced sushi. Not exceptional like Roka Akor, but very good as a regular sushi place."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a snack between lunch and dinner and luckily caught some great HH specials!    The restaurant was virtually empty on a Friday around 3pm, but I didn't mind much as we were in a hurry.  We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed the company of the chef.    The service was a little bit rock to start off as I think 3 different people tried to take our order, but once it got rolling- we were good to go.   I had some Sea Bass Nigiri ($3 for 2 pieces), Spicy Tuna Roll ($3-4), Edamame ($1.50), and a wonderful house salad topped with sliced pears and a delicious house dressing ($3).  The fish was all very fresh and clean tasting, but the salad was honestly my favorite!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST salads I've ever had - the seafood salad. A perfect mix of seafood (salmon, tuna, octopus, etc) and greens."}
