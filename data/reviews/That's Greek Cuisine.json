{"text":"I love this place!!! it's always fresh. We LOVE LOVE LOVE the Chicken Souvalki. i always crave the greek salad from this place. it's full of fresh, delicious ingredients!

The decor is a little old and the music is traditonal greek, and i don't love that part - but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and if you are in the mood for Greek food it's a much better choice than Mr Greek or another 'fast food' type Greek food.
The food is not top shelf by any means but definitely tastes good and is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I wrote a review about bad greek food... so this is a review about really good greek food. I really like this place... I've had really high end greek cuisine before (places on the Danforth, etc). The food at this place is fresh and as good as any I've had before. You'll never leave there hungry. Plus the prices are great and the staff is fantastic. I think the wait staff at this place is the friendliest of anywhere I've ever been."}
{"text":"Quite honestly I believe this place has something else going on for them as there is no other way this place can be still open. 
First step in, there's a smell, something I can't pin point but it's somewhere between old dirty mops and fish. Right there I should have left but my companion had picked the place.
Ordered souvlaki, how wrong can you really go with that? Meet was dry, fries were old with no type of seasoning. We also ordered a seafood salad, which was the worse of our selections as I spent the following day next to a bucket."}
{"text":"Inept service and moussaka with no tomato, no seasonings and eggplant almost entirely inedible due to being burnt to the bottom of the pan it was cooked in.

That's not Greek!  Need I say more."}
{"text":"Im suprised at other reviews on this place. My wife and I have been going here for 3 years. We have only ordered the same thing every time the large Souvlaki dinner 1 chicken 1 pork .. amazing. Mr Greek has nothing on this place. Everything tastes very good not spectacular by any means. Family run  The price was fair and never had any problems with the service. This is not the best Greek place I have ever been to but when ever someone asks for a greek place I always reccomend Thats Greek Cuisine. Price, quality and amount of food is a very good choice."}
{"text":"First of all, the name \"That's Greek Cuisine!\" sounds like the restaurant is resigned to the fact that they're serving Greek cuisine.  I picture someone throwing their arms up and shrugging their shoulders.  If you can picture that, it is what it seems like the chef's attitude is towards the kitchen.  

In any case, I have been here 2 or 3 times and the service has always been quite friendly.  The food is not bad, but not anything to write home about.  It's very Americanized, and doesn't taste overly fresh, and it tastes like the chef just cooked everything out of drudgery.  

I had the pork souvlaki, and it seemed moist and yummy, but a little bit salty.  The Greek salad is not too heavy on the dressing so it's not bad, but I've never been a fan of iceberg lettuce.  The hummus tastes quite homemade, which is good.  The taramosalata is AWFUL here, it tastes like eating Cool Whip.  

Overall - it's not bad here.  But again, nothing to write home about."}
