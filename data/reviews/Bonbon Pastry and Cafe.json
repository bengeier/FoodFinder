{"text":"HORRIFYING. The worst service we have encountered in a very, very long time. 10 minute wait for a menu (and we had to ask) and after another 10 minutes of being ignored we just left.  They weren't even busy.   No response from a polite email informing the owner of our experience.  Good news - no need to bother with this place when there are sO many fabulous places right around the corner!  My husband read Robert's review below, and laughed - \"It sounds exactly like our experience!\""}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I go I get the chorizo gravy and biscuits. It is sooooo good! My wife has tried many things and loved them all. Atmosphere is great, service is great, staff is friendly, definitely one of the top breakfast spots in CLE."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Interesting menu, but the food just did not measure up.  Service was horrendous. Examples. Asked if I was done to which I replied \"Yes\" and the plate was never removed. Had to ask for silverware.  I suspect a function of which sever one gets and time of day one is there. Spin the wheel. You may get lucky.  Oh the check was delivered and I did not have to ask. No surprise."}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly and prompt on a recent Sunday breakfast.had a really good biscuit and gravy and the breakfast burrito my dad had was tasty.my gf had the potato pancakes and they were given a good not great cuz they were borderline overcooked.had the crueller and was worthy of my belly.hot and cinnamony."}
{"text":"Went to Bonbon on Father's Day and was expecting a line, but not.  The place is comfortable, architecturally interesting and in a great location.  My friend had the Toquitos and I had a breakfast special with scrambled eggs, bacon, french press coffee.  The meals were great.  But we couldn't leave without trying the cupcakes.  Later that evening we both ate the cupcakes, I had Red Velvet, my friend had Lemonade.  We both compared notes the next day...verdict:  tasteless cake and tasteless frosting.  My friend said the Lemonade cupcake didn't have a bit of citrus flavor...how can that be?  The food was great....cupcakes...not so much."}
{"text":"ummh! ummh!  Breakfast was great.  Had the corned beef dish with the softboiled custed egg...delicious.  We also indulged in the cinnamon pancakes with the bourbon caramel apple topping...very decadent.   The herbed omelet was great too.  Portion size is great for me, dont expect Bob Evans sized portions, this place will help me keep you healthy!  Great space and kind of funky waiters which I loved so try it...plus its by the greatest market in the world!"}
{"text":"Just had a great breakfast here. 10 AM on a Thursday, walked in alone got sat right away. Had the all day breakfast special: two eggs, bacon, focaccia and French press coffee all for 6.50. Eggs were perfectly over easy, medium/ thick bacon. No need to add salt or pepper, tasted delicious already! Coffee is strong and my cup was never empty. Great food, great service, at the right price in an area that gets pricey sometimes."}
{"text":"The space is very pleasant, the service is usually good, and the plated food has been from good to great. (Except for those strangely sweet brussel sprouts that one time...) The pastry case has never made me happy since she moved into this space. Once the cream in the eclair tasted off and the flourless cake tasted like cheap chocolate. Still, I will go back again and again. It's just such a nice place to go in Ohio City."}
{"text":"I dragged my boyfriend in here one rainy Friday morning before going to the Market. We took a seat in the window, ordered coffee, and browsed the menu while I did my best imitation of a bored yet sophisticated Parisian.   We split the French press and I ordered the herbed omelet; I have no idea what he ordered because I was too busy watching people walk by as I sipped my coffee and adjusted my chapeau.  The omelet was good though a little too herbaceous for my palate. Great spot for a quick, easy breakfast or lunch that fills a void in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I always disregard Yelp reviews about bad service because I feel like it's unfair to judge a place based on one bad server, but having been to this place about a dozen times I can say with confidence that the service here is ALWAYS terrible.   The food is decent and the location is ideal (which is why I keep trying to like the place!) but not good enough to deal with downright rude waitstaff and cold coffee."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews, but it offends me. I was there twice in 2 weeks, and the service was absolutely terrible. The first time, after standing in line for almost 10min behind other customers and checking out the pastries, AND being greeted by a staff member behind the counter, my girlfriend and I were told that they were closed, quite suddenly, and by the same person that greeted us! The second time, a week later, we stood in \"line\" for almost the same amount of time, not really knowing what to do to get a table and food service, and yet again, totally ignored. The staff was running around and looking so crabby with people. We finally ordered coffee drinks when someone deigned to pay attention to us, deciding not to get food, and it took equally as long for a coffee and latte. NO apologies for taking forever to be greeted, to take our order, or for how long it took to make our drinks. And it was the worst latte I have ever had. My review: if you are a new business, you should be nice to people, especially because you never know if the people you are pissing off are the people that would be repeat customers that live right around the corner."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch, average waiting time 15 minutes. Good location but no thing special about the food."}
{"text":"Coffee is tasty, lemon raspberry pancakes were my favorite. A bit small, but nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Overrated. Been there three times and each time some component of my meal was burnt. My dish was dirty and water tasted like booty. Service was better than the food. The food was boring and uninspired; I heard it was better when it first opened. I ate a sandwich and my fingers disintegrated- well, no - but they were really greasy.   Only go there if you wanna give yourself the extra push to commit suicide."}
{"text":"Owner let us sit 8 minutes before closing. Nice guy. The burger I had wad pretty damn good but I was disappointed that they didn't have their barbeque anymore (which was incredible). Overall a nice place with great food."}
{"text":"Lots of eggs, brioche buns and didn't check the dessert case because I'm allergic to eggs. Had mentioned the allergy to the server who came back to the table and mentioned the brioche bun served with the burger. Thanked him. Had my undercooked medium-rare burger on yummy rosemary focaccia. Thank goodness they were out of sweet potato fries I got skinny mass produced fries. Love the Y2K French pressed coffee but agree with the other posters that it is not served hot enough. Love the smell of bleach in the rest room. Like the variety of interesting light fixtures and the style of the place. My visit included a cameo appearance from Eddie Meister \"cheese guy\" from the West Side Market talking to the kitchen folks about an upcoming order. Eddie is great."}
{"text":"This cafe has developed quite a good reputation from being associated with Cupcake Wars, and it usually packed on weekends.  I was impressed by the nicely arranged decor of the restaurant and the selection of pastries behind the counter.  The waitress was prompt to take our orders, although she was quite slow in bringing out our coffee--in fact, she served drinks (coffee as well) to 2 other tables who arrived after we did. The french-press coffee was smooth but not anything spectacular.  The cafe au lait was mediocre and tasted slightly diluted.  We ordered the breakfast special and Nutella french toast.  Both were prepared and plated excellently.  The breakfast special included 2 eggs, with large cuts of focaccia and 2 slices of Apple-smoked bacon.  The french toast included 2 slices of Texas-style toast drizzled with Nutella, powdered sugar, and dollops of fig and apricot compote.    Overall, the food was great, although service could be more prompt.  I think this bakery has helped contribute to the gentrification of the downtown area."}
{"text":"So let me start out saying that the food was not the problem, the food was delicious. It's was worth what it was paid for, and it was huge portions. I loved it.  What I didn't like about this place was the service. As soon as we walked in to the store, no one greeted us, so right away I felt very unwelcome. Then after we took our seat, it didn't get any better. The workers were not pleasant at all, I don't know if they all together had a bad day or what but they we're mean, and just terrible. It really made me want to leave. My friend and I waited for the check for I don't even know how long, and then the waitress took forever to come and pick it up. It felt like she went on a little vacation and came back. The thing that made me upset the most, is that there were only 5 other people in Bon Bon, and the servers acted like the place was packed, they showed no attention or no interest. From my experiences, even packed places had better service then that ! The only nice server was that one guy, he actually came up to people and ask how was everything, find more servers like him. As I always like to say: Good servers, good business. Just kidding, I just made that up.  I like places with good people, this was definitely not one of them."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review.  The food was AMAZING. I got the chicken or the egg.  It was delicious and wasn't totally overwhelming like some dishes like this can be.  I left comfortable instead of wishing I was in yoga pants.  However, the service was pretty awful.  I went with my mom after WSM on a Saturday so I assumed the line would be crazy and we wouldn't get in.  Surprisingly there were only a few people in line and there were empty tables so we decided to wait.  15 minutes went by and the same tables were empty and people weren't being seated.  I was having trouble convincing my mom to not go somewhere else.  Finally after 20 minutes they started clearing tables and sat us at a table that had been open since we arrived.  This put a damper on the whole experience.  I would be willing to try it again because the food was so good and I've heard rave reviews from multiple people.   This could have been an off day.  Hopefully next time I'll have a better review to give.  Until next time Bonbon..."}
{"text":"The cupcakes and macaroons are a must!! Enjoyed the creative brunch menu, the \"chicken or the egg\" is amazing and it's a very cute and hip cafe. Is not accommodating for larger parties and would have liked for the servers to be a little more welcoming.  Still recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"I went to bonbon on a Saturday morning for breakfast with my boyfriend. I ordered the special-2 eggs, bread, bacon, and coffee- for $6 it can't be beat! My bf had the vanilla French toast. It was very good just a little ridiculous to pay $2 extra for syrup. I hope they read these reviews and decide to include it or just make the price $2 more to cover it. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Visiting a friend in Ohio City, she took me to Bonbon for a late Saturday brunch. Wow! Tastiest breakfast I've had out in years. I changed my mind before ordering several times, as one delicious and hearty entree after another was carried by (and the waitress was a little slow to take our order, which afforded extra time). Figuring that I could not go wrong based on what I was seeing, I took a stab at the cheddar and chorizo omelet. I was not disappointed. Super tasty, and filling to boot. Definitely stopping back here on my next visit to C-Town... maybe next time we'll hit the \"breakfast happy hour\" when breakfast entrees in the late afternoon/evening are only $5."}
{"text":"It was one of those morning where you wake up and have no power.  The bf and I were not only starving, but bored, so why not venture out for an early morning breakfast in the OC.  I've always passed Bonbon when taking my alternate route home from work and then you add the word \"pastry\" into the name and I'm sold.  Since I had Bonbon on my list of places to try, this seemed like the perfect morning.    Quaint, cozy, and contemporary - just the vibe I was looking for on a cold, rainy day and that was only the beginning.  Fresh pressed coffee (which was DELICIOUS btw), beer, and sangria (which is made in house and flavors change daily) - it seemed like Bonbon had every remedy to help us turn our morning around.  And then there's the food - oh wow, the food.  I had the bubble & squeak, which recommended by our server  bc I'm incredibly indecisive and so glad she did - it was incredibly tasty.   The bf partook in the breakfast special - eggs, bacon, bread, and choice of beer or coffee (I'll let you guess his choice of beverage) - and for $6 it's a special you can't pass up!    Of course you can't talk about Bonbon without mentioning the pastries.  I could have taken that entire display case home, but unfortunately my butt, hips, and thighs would completely retaliate against me for it, so instead I settled for 3 macaroons and a lemon raspberry cupcake for my sweet tooth fixing (only half of the cupcake actually made it home).     Definitely a place you need to check out.  You'll love the environment, the staff, and the awesome food.  And don't say I didn't warn you about the pastries!"}
{"text":"This was my second time to the restaurant. First time was on a Saturday late in the afternoon close to closing time. Service was less than desirable, but I'm sure it was because we stopped in late. I had the bubble and squeak and it was awesome. I gave it another try a year later on a Sunday morning (this morning) and it was great in both service and food. I had the fried chicken with the homemade English muffin. It was really tasty! Hollandaise was perfect. The service was a lot better today, which made me so happy because the food is great! We like to eat food that isn't processed, fake, or diner-like...and this is a great find with fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Can it be? Brunch all day..in Cleveland? Why yes, it can be indeed. In addition to what hooked me right away (brunch!!), let me mention the reason for my venturing in...the pastries. Lemon bar is awesome (and rather large as compared to their cute little cupcakes). I ordered along with it a cappuccino, got a chai instead, which was pretty solid even though it wasn't what I ordered. The space is very cool and lofty, big windows creating a bright and inviting environment. Only negative is the server seemed to forget about us when it came time for the check. Co-worker and I were a bit late returning to training because we sat and waited, then looked for her, then she came with our checks ready to go. Worth a drop in for sure."}
{"text":"Tasty food, but service had a very blasé attitude. The restaurant was practically empty and our server acted like we were interrupting her day by walking in. The place did end up filling up a bit and we never saw our server again - we had to ask for the check from someone else.  For breakfast I got the breakfast sandwich and my friend got the omelet - both were good but not as impressive as the descriptions in the menu. I'll definitely come back for the pastries, but I was a little disappointed as I expected to find my new favorite brunch place in Bonbon."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place many times, and I finally walked in to it! I ordered the bumble and squeak. It was flavorful without being too loud. The brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked. The maple bacon was delicious and I could definitely have more of that please. I think this is probably the most worthwhile item on their menu.  The donuts were hot and fluffy and the dipping sauces are a fun touch! As for the pastries, I got a lavendar lemon macaron which was mediocre, the chocolate croissant was awesome, the cupcake was a little better than the average but not mindblowingly good, and the crueller was on the bland side. Summary: bumble&squeak + croissant = yum!   I'd definitely come back here to try their other menu items!  p.s. My friends got the omelet and the breakfast sandwich. Bumble and squeak trumps them by far."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to do so much better.  Gave it two stars because the food was good.  Thought previous negative reviews were a little pretentious, but it turns out the waitress was indeed \"passive\". Q: Do you have any gluten free bakery products I can get with my meal? A: Ask the bakery staff over there.  They handle that stuff.  I asked for a mocha...and got black coffee.  My fault for not speaking up?  Slow service.  Overall, we spent nearly an hour there for a lunch of sandwiches for three.  The restaurant was about half full.  I would love for this trendy place to be my \"second office\"...will keep looking."}
{"text":"Over-priced on certain items but lacking quality and decent portions for the price. The waitress was kind of rude, and just threw the check on the table as if she couldn't wait for the place to close. Cute atmosphere though - if the food and service was better I would come here often."}
{"text":"I popped in to Bon Bon while waiting to pick up my husband, and I'm glad I did! I got the special of two eggs, bacon, focaccia and coffee for $6.95. The eggs were well cooked, the focaccia was delicious and the bacon was divine. The french press coffee was also really great. Overall I am totally pleased with my experience.  The only reason it is 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price point of the other entrees. Most of the breakfast entrees were around $10 with things like omelets and eggs Benedict coming in around $13. So, it's just a little higher than I'd like in a favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for brunch, and now need to go back and try pretty much everything on the menu.   We split a cinnamon cruller while waiting for a table (don't judge) which was buttery, flaky and delicious.   Both mom and I got the breakfast special (2 eggs, cider bacon, focaccia and french-press coffee for like $6!) because neither one of us can pass up a good deal. Plus it sounded tasty. And oh my, it was.   If you like hot sauce, ask for it. It's house-made, sriracha-red and spicy but also lends a great flavor that balanced really well with the other breakfast goodies."}
{"text":"Went there twice to make sure it wasn't me. Nope the service sucks. The food is particular to taste- not a place that anyone can find something on the menu. Read menu before going and only go at happy hour."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here for a Saturday Lunch.  The service was excellent and the decor is great, it's very bright and airy.  It's a welcome respite from the darker and more serious bars and brewpubs in the neighborhood.    Each of the four dishes were excellent, although the portion size of 'The Kitchen Sink' is extremely small - especially for a dish whose name implies otherwise.     The prices are probably more suitable for dinner than for a breakfast or lunch, but the quality of each item easily justified the cost.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I walked in and got a smile even though i was only getting coffee.  one day i will stay and get a muffin."}
{"text":"Delicious and thoughtlful food will bring me back to this brunch/lunch spot. As noted in other reviews, the service is often slow, but always friendly. I had the all-day breakfast special on my first visit and was a very happy camper - delicious, thick maple bacon, gooey poached eggs and crunchy herbed focaccia. Yum. Today I had the slow roasted pork with pear compote and st.andre cheese with a crusty baguette which was absolutely divine. Portions are satisfying but won't leave you feeling stuffed.   The space is also very inviting with huge sunny windows and fresh flowers on every table.   I'm holding on to my fifth star for the slow (and sometimes forgetful) service - I almost didn't get my meal the first time and  our waitress wouldn't check in with us until I literally flagged her down. I'm going to attribute this to growing pains (the place has only been open a few months) and will hopefully be able to dole out the fifth star soon.   Definitely given this spot a try if you're looking for a new place to brunch. Yum."}
{"text":"Space is beautiful... concept is all there... the breakfast choices were good, but cold... coffee was lukewarm.   The main reason we went was to sample the award winning cupcakes.  Sadly, we were completely disappointed at the tasteless, stale, dry divinities we purchased.  We bought one of each in the case to take home and try, and each was equally stale.  Very disappointing for a pastry guru of this caliber.    Keep trying.... Ohio City really needs a place like this!"}
{"text":"Came for coffee one morning, service and sesting on par. Coffee was exceptionally disappointing - weak, watered down, coffee was made with burnt milk (steamed for way too long.) 3 dollars I won't be seeing again.   Didnt end up eating so I cant vouch for the food but my small experience has been underwhelming."}
{"text":"Love Bonbon...almost a weekly visit for us. Taquitos, pancakes, bubble and squeak all good. Cupcakes delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic - my favorite brunch spot in Cleveland.  The breakfast nachos are amazing and I'm glad they are now served in a bowl (the plate made a bit of a mess).  My girlfriend loves the \"Chicken or the egg\".  I have not had a bad thing off of the brunch menu."}
{"text":"I ate here this morning (10/7/12)  with my family.  The waitress and hostess were nice, but it took 45 minutes for our food to be ready.  When I went to eat my omelet, I realized the inside was completely raw.   The waitress politely offered to fix it.  The cooks threw my omelet back on the pan, then returned it to the original plate on which it was served (with the raw eggs).  I decided not to make a big deal, and just ate some of my mom's breakfast instead.  When the waitress asked why I didn't eat it, I said how it was served on the plate that had raw eggs and I didn't want to risk getting sick.  She said it's fine because it had been cooked to \"a certain temperature.\"  I didn't think you needed a degree in food science to to understand the basics of cross-contamination, but apparently by the waitress and cook's behavior, I was wrong.  The owner was nice and took it off the bill, but I left hungry as I certainly wasn't going to wait another 45 minutes for something else.  At one point, my mom politely asked if our food was going to be ready soon, and the waitress said \"it takes a long time, because it's gourmet.\"  I'll think I'll pass on the gourmet raw omelet, long wait, and seemly unclean kitchen in the future..."}
{"text":"Our group was in town from Chicago and Denver and stumbled upon this place. We were all extremely pleased with the food. We had breakfast nachos, Stacey Cakes, Chicken or the Egg, and the Chorizo Biscuits. Each was unique and flavorful. It's always nice finding a unique brunch spot when visiting other cities. The only area of improvement is the service, we felt that the servers could be a bit more friendly. They served us promptly, but they didn't seem extremely happy to be doing so."}
{"text":"Pros: Uhhh can't really think of anything. I guess the coffee wasn't bad. SOME of the servers were attentive and friendly...  Cons: We both received glasses of water when we were sat. BOTH glasses were filthy. Mine had nasty brown flecks of GOD KNOWS WHAT on the inside rim. Z's water seemed to have oil residue on the inside, as a film formed on the top of his water. We returned them and received new waters...AGAIN, the glasses were absolutely disgusting. I almost lost my appetite.   Since Z couldn't drink his nasty water, he wanted more coffee. Unfortunately, NOT ONE server came to our table for about 25 minutes (when we received our food).  Although pretty grossed out, we were still real hungry and hoping Bonbon would redeem itself with some yummy breakfast. The mediocre and low-quality food we received just reinforces the fact that this place is OVERRATED. WHO GIVES A CRAP if they were on CUPCAKE WARS? I for sure don't."}
{"text":"I like Bonbon.  What I like about it best is the space.  It's bright and clean with great big windows so you can watch the city go by as you dine. I've dined there twice for breakfast now.  I felt the food was basically good -- once having the pancakes and the second time the Irish breakfast.  The coffee was decent but was advertised as French press and it came in a cup.  Would have expected it to come, well, in a French press. Staff could probably use a little better training but they were all quite cordial and accommodating.  I would and will return to Bonbon."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and was pleased both times.  I had an herb and fontina omelet, and the breakfast nachos.  I would recommend the nachos, just because they were so filling and delicious.    Bonbon serves breakfast until 3 (I think.  At least 2) which is a big plus.  I am not the kind of person who gets up early on the weekend.  Their coffee is good, and their water comes in jars, which is cutesy.  I had a sesame macaron one time on the way out, which is the only thing here that has disappointed me.  It really didn't taste like sesame at all."}
{"text":"Cupcakes featured in Food Network's Cupcake Wars - yep, it's no surprise they won! Yum. Hubby and I loved our brunch here as well. Very pleasantly surprised at the great flavors in both our orders. Plating was pretty, and tasted as good as it looked!"}
{"text":"Great coffee...and not much more. Flew into Cleveland early on a Saturday, eagerly awaiting breakfast. Service was not so polite and our pancakes came out lukewarm which is hard to accomplish, given that we were the first customers at 7:1am."}
{"text":"Am visiting Cleveland and searched for a good breakfast spot. Bonbon was perfect. Nice ambiance and delicious food. The quality of ingredients, combination of flavors, and care taken in preparing the food were all excellent. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Bonbon Pastry and Café is welcome addition to Ohio City.  Within their first week open, I patronized the establishment 4 times and I won't be a stranger, as this beautifully designed café has undoubtedly the BEST cup of coffee in Cleveland.  The brunch-style menu is uniquely classic with the Bubble & Squeak and Pulled Pork making my top favorites.  Every baked good and pastry is sinfully rich and decadent, including their fresh, buttery croissants.  Beginning this month, they'll have a full liquor license, so you can take in the spanning views of downtown and the West Side Market while enjoying a glass of wine or scotch.  Congrats to Cupcake Wars winner, Courtney Bonning and her team for truly filling a void within Cleveland's ever expanding and widely diverse culinary scene."}
{"text":"Picked up pastry orders from Bon Bon a few times. I'll say, it'll leave you conflicted. They're guaranteed to get your order wrong every time, but your guaranteed to love whatever they give you, every time. If Bon Bon ever learns how to run a business, they'll take over the world."}
{"text":"Please Bonbon, I really really really want to give you 5 stars...  This is my alternative breakfast/brunch weekend stop. Here's the wrap-up of my last few visists: Pros: - Great coffee. Great service. Great decor and ambiance. Good pastries. Love the location, and it's usually not extremely busy like other brunch spots. We usually have the same server, who remembers us and that we need coffee asap. She's awesome and honest about items on the menu. Speaking of awesome, the french toast with berry and corn compote is delish... however needs more butter/syrup/compote--or something!  Cons: -Small portions. The sauces are usually delish, however the sauce to meat or sauce to veggie proportions are VERY off. I always have to ask for extra honey with the yogurt/granola dish, as not to have the yogurt completely dry out in my mouth. The avocado burger was extremely disappointing as the pastry bun tasted like dried cardboard and the burger was so dry I couldn't eat it. There was seriously nothing on it but greens, meat and a slice of avocado. Hmpf, this could've been a great burger with a little something to add flavor. The breakfast nachos were more of the same. Great concept, however very dry and could be awesome with more cheese/pico/salsa/etc. The french toast is definitely worth ordering, however you will need more of the compote or add syrup, as it is dry as well. The cornbeef hash was different than any other I had ever tried, however it was good, in a Bonbon type of way. I usually eat every morsel on the plate here, and wished I got more for what I pay... Again, very small servings...  I've eaten at Bonbon several times, and will probably continue to do so, but I have learned exactly \"how\" to order to get what I am looking for. I feel like the restaurant is very very close to 5 stars for food, if they could just give me more food and MORE SAUCES in the dishes! Thanks, Bonbon!"}
{"text":"I hate to be one of those people that come right back after a bad experience of a restaurant and write a yelp review, but fuck it.   So i've been here twice now, first when they were open with just a minimal menu, and then today with the full menu. The first time I went I  had the french toast, which was a giant portion, but very overwhelming with bitter sweet chocolate. Also the marmalade and blood orange is maybe a tablespoon. not nearly enough to have with every bite. So it ends up just tasting like a giant piece of chocolate soaked bread. My coffee the first time was cold. I expect this is because they kept the coffee in the french press and if you dont get one of the first pours, it's just going to keep getting colder. Now the second time I went, my coffee was much better, i expect because i got one of the first pours, but that's where the good ends.   1) I paid $12 for 3 store bought flour tortillas, 2 scrambled eggs which were split unevently into the 3 tortillas, and 12 pieces of micro lettuce.  this is called the 'breakfast tacitos\" I call it a fucking rip off. there was NO bacon, NO mushroom NO leeks. nothing.  2) our coffees came as we finished our brunch. yes after. They didn't even offer anything for it, only an explanation of  'oh something is wrong with the coffee maker' little did they realize that i could see people going in and out with coffee's from the take out section 3) my girlfriends 'herbed omelet' tasted like a christmas tree. not an appealing thing when it comes to eggs.   I need to just go here for pasteries, because the brunch so far is meh. I really really want to like this place. But i'm so fucking hesitant to pay for mediocre food from them. Maybe their $6 early bird breakfast will be better? It's 2 eggs, toast, bacon and coffee. Now that sounds like a value. But it's probably actually a sliver of toast, 1 peice of bacon and barely 2 eggs. it's bad to have a bad outlook on a place, but I have to be that way now that they are 0 for 2."}
{"text":"The food was extremely flavorful, and just the right size portion. I had the Bubble and Squeak - root vegetable patty, maple bacon, poached egg. The sauce was so good I was practically licking it off the plate at the end. My friends both got sandwiches which looked amazing, super fresh, large portions.  Since they were a Food Network Cupcake Wars winner I had to get a cupcake. I got a lemon, cream cheese, fig cupcake. It was amazing, possibly the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had. Both the cake part and the icing are more dense, not airy like a lot of cupcakes, so even though it was small, it felt like a good sized dessert.  The atmosphere reminded of a shop in downtown Portland, OR. My friend said it reminded her of the mom and pop restaurants in Australia."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, Colleen and Adam are super nice and funny servers. They seem to have a lot of regulars and its a breath of fresh air to see someone in the food industry laugh with customers."}
{"text":"Great!!! This place is very New York style. The food is awesome and creative. Love the jar water glass!"}
{"text":"SMORES CUPCAKE!!!! Get it! It's amazing!!! This place is incredible. Iced carmel latte and cupcake only $5. Also amazing service, not stuck up coffee snobs. Wish I lived here or I would go all the time!"}
{"text":"The services was EXCELLENT. I went on a weekday with a friend for brunch and the food was served really fast. Their hot chocolate is nothing to talk about so I wouldn't get that again. Their breakfast nachos were delicious!!! My friend had the silver pancakes and I thought they were too small and not much texture involved with it, however she did liked them a lot. I will definitely go back for the breakfast nachos and the CUPCAKES!  They have THE BEST cupcakes in the area. They are juicy, flavorful and the right portion to reduce the guilt. They have so many flavors, I would stop by to get them even if I don't sit to eat."}
{"text":"This is the place to be for Breakfast/Brunch!   My friends and I recently ate here and it was fantastic! The coffee is French Pressed (downfall is it's $3) but if you eat there its endless refills and lets all be honest the coffee here is fantastic! Their pastries are all made in house and the first item that seems to sell out every time I visit are the chocolate croissants.  I ordered the Bubble & Squeak this time around and I wanted another plate right after I finished the first one! This dish is full of flavor! The root vegetable patty was nice and light and the bacon, oh the bacon, makes this dish extra special. I think everyone needs to order this dish at least once! I have had multiple menu items and this by far is my favorite. Oh and for those of you with a sweet tooth the specialty french toast when I was visiting was Salted Caramel!  This is a great place to grab a quick pastry and hot cup of coffee or eating a quick, inexpensive delcicious plate of food before heading to the market."}
{"text":"I have zero complaints about the food.  Love it and it is different.  But I have gone there three times in the past three weeks and have had pretty bad service each time. I need to find our waitress/waiter to get silverware or to take our order or even to get ketchup (had to ask four times).  I am hoping things will progress because I like it there and it's a great location.  Just need a bit of work on wait staff!  I have faith:)"}
{"text":"Away from west 25 street if you don't want to be in the middle of everything. Old style building with high ceilings and beautiful wood floors. Love the atmosphere. Parking is close too. Got the traditional pancakes and bacon with cuts of slice apple and grapes. Excellent presentation. Would go again!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write this because I don't want others to find this amazing spot. We drove up from Akron today for breakfast and it was well worth the trip. It is as good as the unique breakfast places we've found in NYC and other larger cities.   The space is modern with a touch of historical charm if that makes sense at all. I had the taquitos which were fresh, unique and flavorful. The black beans, avocado and cheese blended perfectly with the eggs and bacon. And that hot sauce was a little sweet which I liked. My husband had the bacon, bacon, eggs and he loved it. The maple syrup paired nicely with the pork. He also loved the French press coffee in a large cup...important in the morning.   We will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Small place, friendly service. Breakfast on Sunday morning, quiche with salad and hubby's chorizo biscuits, very good. Bought pastry to bring home from a good looking selection of fresh baked items."}
{"text":"My sister and I went there for lunch on a Tuesday. We needed some time to talk about school loans and the birth control industrial complex. I had a perfectly lovely cobb salad with perfect bacon. My sister showed me her new day planner she had purchased from some activist collective, it had a lot of ink drawings of mushrooms, and a menstrual cycle calendar, but I thought it was odd they hadn't taken the time to mark certain holidays on the calendar, like International Workers Day or Cesar Chavez's birthday. Our waitress had beautiful enamel earrings that looked like painted buttons. She walked by us to another table with the 4 cutest miniature cupcakes on a plate, they looked like fake cupcakes you would leave on the kitchen table in a dollhouse. My sister mentioned how she needed the food to kick in and up her blood sugar. I suggested she get a hot chocolate to go, but when we ordered two, she changed her mind and got a double espresso. The to-go espresso cup was the most adorable paper vessel ever.  It was as if you sent a Dixie Cup to charm school in Paris.   We got in the car, and started driving down Lorain avenue. I asked her if she wanted me to pour some of the  chocolate in her espresso, she declined. I finally took a sip of my hot chocolate.  \"Carrie, you have to try this.\"  I handed it to her.  \"Oh My God.\"  \"I know\" \"That tastes like an Easter bunny.\" \"It tastes like Lily's hot chocolate, it's so good.\" \"It's SO good.\"  We drove in silence for a few minutes. I tried to sip the chocolate slowly, and roll it around my mouth, coat my tongue with it.   \"Bridget, I changed my mind, I do want hot chocolate in my espresso.\"  I filled her little perfect paper espresso cup almost to the brim. But I really really didn't want to.It was a beautiful post rain afternoon. I wished that I had a little silver coffeepot of this hot chocolate, and a cushioned porch swing with a very warm blanket, and the whole day to sit around and read."}
{"text":"The food here was worth a wait, just not the wait we had to endure to get a table for a Sunday brunch. It took almost an hour for us to be seated. Half an hour into our wait, a new customer walked in and was sat at an outside table. The host never asked us if we would like to sit there or offered it in any sense before giving to the new customer. We felt misled. The food didn't entirely overcome our dissatisfaction, but it was good nonetheless and would be worth a return visit."}
{"text":"The French Toast was underwhelming. The Nutella was so sparingly drizzled about it. Dry and difficult to eat. I should have gone with a burger or chicken sandwich. Those looked amazing and the people eating them looked happier."}
{"text":"I have been to Bonbon four times now, and have always had a pleasant experience. They have an amazing assortment of pastries, cookies, and macaroons at their dessert counter. Their fried chicken is also to die for! Service has been slow here and there, but definitely can be overlooked given the overall qualify of the food. Great location with cozy give and friendly staff. Definitely a go to brunch/lunch spot in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Friendly service, good food. The chili I had was amazing. When we got it, it wasn't warm enough, and the chef came out and apologized which was nice and the chili came back hot and very tasty. A friendly place to eat breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good & they  have breakfast all day but but plan on being here for at least 45min if you order food, even if no one else is here. I've been here 5 times & really slow each time."}
{"text":"4 stars for delicious and well prepared foods, but 0.5 stars for the waitstaff. Not rude but just cool and indifferent/aloof, not warm or inviting in any way. I had the chicken or the egg, bf had the breakfast special. My chicken was wonderfully seasoned and juicy, the side of fruit was a welcome alternative to breakfast potatoes.  The bf's bacon was probably the best I've ever had. I'd recommend this place for sure, but don't expect a warm welcome or doting service."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back here on the weekends for brunch. Cute spot where you can get a tasty brunch and some awesome expresso drinks too. I had the salmon bagel that had an amazing dill cream cheese with capers spread so delicious! Came with 2 eggs any style. I was also able to try the chorizo breakfast nachos which were good and a large portion. My favorite part is being able to order some legit expresso at a brunch spot instead of just coffee. On top of that I was able to get desert with my brunch which never happens! Got the crueller and it was made fresh and still warm when we got it  I will for sure be back to try some more of their bakery items!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new spot in Ohio City.  So, so disapointed.  Our coffee was cold, our food was really salty, and our service was painful.  For $40 (after tip) for two beverages and 2 breakfasts. I would MUCH rather go to flying fig for brunch and enjoy cocktails and superior food and service."}
{"text":"This place is my \"Cheers .\"  They have my order down pat every time I walk in, and they are already making my latte before I sit down.  Ashley and Robert always make my experience a personable and fun one. The Cobb Salad is my fave but now it has evolved into the Harvest Salad. It is still good but I miss the beets in the Cobb!  Love the food live the vibe."}
{"text":"Cute cafe with convenient location. Very nice & friendly staff. Had the apple chai which was spicy & delicious but very sweet. Also had the s'mores dessert which was pretty good. If I go back will definitely try something else but everything looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful place for unique breakfast food.  The pastries are amazing, can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my recent  BonBon experience. A group of 5 of us went for brunch on a Sunday around 12pm. Apparently the restaurant only has one table to accommodate parties larger than 4. We waited for over an hour as parties of 2, 3, and 4 were sat before us. There were groups who arrived after us and were sat, ate and left before us. Once we finally were sat at a table, atleast 20 mins passed until we finally asked a hostess if there was a waiter to help us. She took our order, but seemed annoyed that we asked her to be helped. Another server let us know the kitchen was backed up and offered us muffins. I wasn't feeling well and left before the food arrived and had my friends bring it home for me. Overall, I was very disappointed with my experience. I had been there for brunch before with a friend on a Saturday and was pleased. Unfortunately, I would not recommend BonBon to larger parties who don't make a reservation."}
{"text":"Been here twice during our short visit. Cool, cosy atmosphere. All the waitresses were especially sweet, laid back and friendly. The bacon black bean soup was seriously in the top 3 (if not the top) soups I have ever had (My mom's soups included). The chicken and the egg is a sure bet and so is the corn beef hash. The hollandaise sauce is made to Perfection so if u don't get a dish that has it make sure to order on the side.   Ask for Ashley (ask her about her trip to the south) her smile will brighten your day."}
{"text":"The absolute best french toast I've had in years. The vanilla bean french toast was so good that it didn't even need syrup. Service was quick and the staff was super friendly. Good to know a place like this exist in the city. Usually only come around these spots in NY or Chicago."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and so happy that we saw this place on Yelp! We are driving from NY to Chicago and this was the perfect stop for brunch. Friendly service, quaint atmosphere and delicious food. Try the breakfast tacos and the French press coffee."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast and it was good; not sure how much I have to say. I will do my best...  Small-ish  interior, but comfortable. place wasn't super crowded, so we were seated and served promptly. I ordered the breakfast special - two eggs, bacon and focaccia bread. Everything was good, if not spectacular. I did like the glazed bacon. My wife had the vanilla French toast and even though sweet breakfast us not my bag, it was good. Coffee was good, too. A tad expensive, but not bad.  So all in all, another good place to have morning grub."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes were amazing, the flavor was superb, my cousin had the corned beef hash and thats was seasoned very well and the presentation was incredible. The staff was friendly and offered good customer service and the place was clean. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I was kind of skeptical of this place because of some bad reviews, but omg it was delicious! The service was bad at first but halfway through we got a different waitress and she was so nice! We got the chicken or egg and eggs Benedict. It was super delicious!"}
{"text":"The pastries are delicious and the coffee is so rich. My server was friendly and efficient, I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Servers were rude. Service excruciatingly slow.  The ice water was good. Have been here before and things were better. What happened???"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 5.  A lot of things make up a perfect brunch in my eyes, and BonBon has almost all of them.  Large glass windows- check.  Limited tables- check.  Quick but not pushy service- check.  Comfortable neighborhood \"I live here\" feel- check.  Would love to see them get a few makeshift tables outside in the summer, not sure if they do that or not since we were there just a couple weeks ago.  Cost: 3. A tad overpriced versus portions for Cleveland, BUT I would say that Lucky's Café nearby is similar or worse price points and most choose to ignore price there also.  Give BonBon some wiggle room.  Food Quality: 4. Silver Dollar pancakes solid choice, but Breakfast Nachos were legitimate.  Almost a five, but the chorizo topping was a bit crispy and too minced.  However, would still order it again in a heartbeat.  Omelets looked great around us.  Service: 5. A few reviews were hating on the service so I want to set the record straight: all the tables were full (we were took last table when we sat down) and we had pretty much what I consider perfect, but not rushed, service.  Knew menu well, drink refills promptly, but we never felt rushed.  When to return:  Brunch.  Pre-West Side Market Saturday shopping spree.  Cold wintertime day for coffee or pastry run.  Warm summer day for some mimosa's and eggs.  Meeting up with an old friend and catching up over coffee and a snack.  Note: I really wanted to give this place a 5 since it looks like there's tons of old, limited reviews bogging them down, but can't pull the trigger until I make it there at least one more time to make sure my experience wasn't a lucky fluke.  And if you're reading this far, you already realize this is a 5 star review if you don't care about money."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Bustling during Saturday brunch but they were efficient! My daughter and I split the special: pancakes with eggs, bacon, toast. She had hot cider and I loved the coffee. Got some macarons to go, they had 8 flavors to choose from. We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I google breakfast places and this came up as one of the suggestions. To start off they have a crisp menu with not common combinations. Most of the breakfast items have one or two fruits added on top which ups the freshness quotient. I ordered chicken egg with avocado, and I have to say it looked tempting,With layer of toasted bread, medium egg, fried chicken breast piece, slice of avocado and hollandaise sauce. And of course couple of strawberries and blueberries to add the color and freshness. The first bite is like how jazz music is to ears. The different flavors blend in do salsa in your mouth. The sauce was creamy and not too heavy and chicken cooked to the optimum level. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I went to this breakfast bar place with a few friends for brunch and was so super excited! At the entrance, there is an array of delicious looking pastries. I was especially looking forward to the cupcakes since they had own cupcake wars!   We sat down and ordered, full of excitement and anticipation. The food came out and looked gorgeous! But three bites later, I was overcome by the greasiness and butteriness of it all! The hollandaise sauce on my chicken or the egg (fried chicken eggs Benedict) was so heavy! It was all over my entire plate!! I tried to rub some of it off and tried even skinning the chicken, but all to no avail. That butter was sticking to the food and was not leaving. I felt nauseous from all the grease.  I didn't even have room for the cupcakes! But it was my friends birthday and so we got an eclair to share, of which I had a few bites. This place is definitely a pastry place! That cream was so smooth and cold and delicious. The pastry was perfectly soft. I wish I was not so full that I had room for more dessert.  I'll definitely be back for some pastries, but I'll probably pass on the breakfast foods. I'm too young to die from cholesterol overdose."}
{"text":"I have been on a macaroon kick for the past 2 years and whenever I travel to NYC I am practically hoarding macaroons in my purse. So to say I have been disappointed with the macaroon scene in Cleveland is an understatement. There is Luna but with maybe 3 flavors and very small, it's really not worth it.   I then found out Bonbon has them so on my lunch break I headed over to try some. I was happy with the variety- I think 6 different flavors but 2 very odd- a sesame and some other kind.   Overall, meh. At the price, I expect them to be good. Some were dry and way to chewy and others fell apart in your hand so you had a hand full of broken up macaroon. Not good especially for the price. I just hope there other pastries are good :/"}
{"text":"I was excited when I learned another brunch place has opened in Ohio City. Since their opening I have been there 3 times and each time I hope to get a better experience. Unfortunately after 3 visits I can only give them a 2-star rating. The 1st time I went the service was very slow. Took them a while to get the orders. After an hour they found out they didn't put the order ticket in. The most recent time I went the service was a bit faster: about 5 tables were occupied but it still took them more than 10 minutes to stop by to take orders. I ordered the egg Benedict. The Canadian bacon was too dry, the sauce was sour, and the potato fries were too dry and very salty. My friend loves salt but agrees the fries were too salty... Besides that the waitress had a frowny sad face on the whole time...she made me feel bad to eat there and increase her workload. One thing I liked about this place is their decor. Big windows let in a lot of natural light. Simple and chic furniture."}
{"text":"During my pre-Yelp days, I was a pretty big fan of BonBon. Extremely good breakfast food and pastry, decently priced, all while being at the heart of a foodie-centric Ohio City. This time, my mom and I went on a Sunday afternoon for a relaxed brunch. Even though the 30 minute wait seemed to drag on forever, it was worth it when began to eat. My mom ordered the homemade biscuits with chorizo sausage gravy, which may have been some of the best breakfast food I have ever tasted, while I opted for the massive meatloaf sandwich on a rustic herb focaccia layered an onion ring and \"Cleveland Sauce.\" (barbeque meets ketchup meets sweet and sour... strange, but delicious) The sandwich was HUGE in both size and flavor and it came with a side of salad greens which I thought were just slightly underdressed. The iced chai I ordered was also a high point of the meal with its' subtle notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. After all of this praise though, you may be wondering why I gave BonBon only three stars. One word... Service. First of all, no one came by to check on us while we were eating, which isn't really a big deal to me, but it's a little irritating. Also, we were never brought the hot sauce and waters we asked for, until a waitress came by and gave us one that was an extra from another table. It's stuff like this that upsets me, and causes me to drop a rating. Overall though, the food was delicious and probably a 4.5/5, but it seemed like the wait staff had a hard time dealing with a crowded restaurant."}
{"text":"So, I've been here before & was not a happy camper the last time.  The prices were high, the food quality poor, the service, eh, and the mimosa's small.  Granted, I was there on a busy Saturday am, but still....service is service.  This visit was a Monday, post West Side Market Trip.  The man & I were HUNGRY and I suggested we grab a bite.  Honestly, I would have gone to the Flying Fig & we were on our way there, but the door was locked & the lights were off.  Bonbon, got lucky! :)  (And so did we actually.)  Our waiter was nice, cool & aloof, but in a good way.  I ordered a mimosa (heavy on the champagne) and whoa baby did he oblige!  The tiny mimosa from the previous time was a distant memory by the time I left. ;)  I ordered the weekday special of eggs, foccacia, bacon, and coffee.  $6.99  Not a bad deal!  The man ordered pancakes that had an apple compote on top.  Yummy!  We had a nice same-side sitting (the beau's idea) breakfast at Bonbon.  I purchased a macaroon to go for das mann, which he ate while we sat there.  I even snagged a bit.  It was delish!    I'll come back Bonbon.  Thank you for changing my mind!"}
{"text":"Yummy treats come check them out you wont be disappointed that you did. And leave your feedback all local shops need the help"}
{"text":"Finally a great breakfast spot that also has great expresso. Had the breakfast nachos, a cappuccino and a fresh hot French crueller. The nachos were amazing with a ton of fresh bell pepper and onions, the perfect amount of cheese and chorizo.  The crueller was also great. Hard on the outside and soft and moist on the inside and covered in brown sugar. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was ok at best however the service staff was unapproachable and only became attentive when it was time to pay. There was no one waiting to be seated and the small restaurant had seven employees working .  We had to ask for our silverware and was never provided water refills .    As to our meal choices we ordered the breakfast tacos and the bubble squeak (I believe ) . The breakfast tacos were unoriginal and bland . The bubble squeak was creative but the flavors did not mix well together . I believe they dumped syrup on the dish - lent to a strange flavor .  We ordered the crueler and that was delicious - especially the chocolate served with it .  Overall we would not recommend and we will not go back ."}
{"text":"Just went to bonbon for the first time and my boyfriend and I loved it ! I had the chicken or the egg and he had the potato pancakes. We were both very happy with our meals and would highly recommend going to try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE  I honestly don't know how I've lived only a block away for 6 months and this is the first time I've stopped into Bonbon. Ohio City just has so many great places, its hard to eat at them all! But I'm sure willing to try...  This is the perfect little bakery and cafe. They have tables to sit down and order off their menu, and you can also take their tasty pastries to go. We stopped on a Sunday morning before doing some shopping at WSM and it was pretty crowded but there was one table open, perfect. Their coffee was really good, not sure if they use local (I hope so).   Our server (Adam, I think) was very friendly and attentive. He got our order in quickly, and checked on us periodically throughout our meal. Other servers also walked around refilling coffee at everyone's tables.   They have a bigger menu then I was expecting and everything sounded really good. I've heard good things about the bubble and squeak, but decided to go with their quiche. They rotate the flavors, but on this day the quiche was spinach, mushroom and feta, and it was delicious. It came with a small side salad with apple cider vinaigrette, which was perfect to cut the richness of the quiche. My boyfriend had the breakfast tacos and he was really pleased with his choice. He appreciated that the tortillas were warmed, he gets burritos/tacos a lot when we eat out and unwarmed tortillas are his pet peeve.   Although we didn't try any bakery items this time, I will definitely be ordering a cruller, which they serve hot and fresh. A lot of people around us were ordering these, and they smelled amazing. I heard their chocolate croissants are out of this world. And they won Cupcake Wars...so you know those cupcakes are BOMB.  I say it a lot, but this is officially my new favorite breakfast place. you'll probably see me there, eating a cruller, next week."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that I'm giving my first experience at Bonbon 2-2.5 stars.  When we walked in, I immediately appreciate the large windows, cozy atmosphere, cute decor... it was great to have all that sun coming into the restaurant!  However, despite the amazing ambiance, I felt like I ordered the wrong thing. I was looking for something not super-savory and vegetarian-friendly. There were a few options and I landed on the granola crisp, even though in the back of my mind I was thinking I should've ordered something else. The waitress said it was filling, but mostly because it was sweet. That should have tipped me off right there.  When the granola crisp came, it was very different than what I had imagined. I thought it was going to actually be more like a baked apple crisp. When it arrived, there was a thin layer of granola covering apples soaked in a super-sweet compote/liquid. It was almost like eating apple-pie filling -- I just wasn't sure how this could stand-alone as a dish. It was too sweet for my taste, and I only got an inch into my bowl before I had to stop.   On the plus side, I took it home so that I can warm it up later and pour it as a syrup over my vanilla ice cream for dessert.  I'm also very curious about the pricing structure. The bacon bacon and egg is $6.50 and you get 2 strips of bacon and several slices of pork belly. My bf ordered the omelet for $8, and they gave a small, half moon omelet with ~6\" diameter. Perhaps they used very special herbs and cheese, but I couldn't quite tell from the taste. I'm not sure how that ended up being $8.   If I come again, I'll definitely try the coffee and another dish. I'm not super excited about much on the menu though.  Finally, this might just be picky, but I think that servers just need to taste everything on the menu. I have a hard time when we ask what they suggest and they say that they haven't tried something before, which is what happened with our table that day. This seems to be different from others' experience, so you may need to take my word with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Lots of great vegetarian and vegan options, and many of the items on the menu can be made so.  The breakfast nachos with eggs was delicious and hearty. We also got a poached egg atop brussel sprouts which blew us away.  Our chocolate eclair was perfect, and the cupcakes, which this place is known for, was moist and sugary. The butterscotch pudding, however, didn't taste at all of butterscotch. Stick with the baked goods.  The place is nicely designed, and feels airy and young, with all the windows overlooking the street.  It's a great brunch place, but expect to wait."}
{"text":"I'm really starting to enjoy this place for Breakfast/Lunch,  guess I mean brunch, right?    First off, they do things with Eggs that I have never experienced or tasted before anywhere across the country.  Also, this place is not your typical 3 Eggs any style with Bacon, Coffee, and toast for $1.99 before 8am.  Its very well priced for your the amount of food they give you and everything I've tried so far has been excellent.    Corn Beef Hash-Excellent! Breakfast Nacho's-Unreal!  Steak and Potato Omlette-Satisfying!    Also, they have some of the best Bacon I have ever tried too.  Definitely get a side of their bacon, you won't be disappointed.    Overall, In highly recommned BonBon its worth the trip down to Ohio City!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what eggs Benedict the other reviewers had but mine weren't worth $15 that's for sure. It's a bit pricey but I'm assuming it's because their rent is crazy to be in a prime location on west 25th. The wait could have been better we were seated immediately but had to wait over 30 min for our food. No Bueno. My husband had some macaroons and he said they were amazing, I'm so jealous I have a nut allergy! All in all it was a nice little brunch but for ME it was overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for brunch the other day and I became a fan. It was a nice atmosphere with friendly staff. We decided to try it on the suggestion from a friend. I loved the little cinnamon donuts. My wife is vegetarian and really enjoyed the tofu scramble. It was a portion that was greater than expected. My chorizo gravy over biscuits was amazing. Coffee was pleniful and delicious.  It did take a little long between coffee and ordering but not so long to be annoying. If I was in a hurry to get somewhere it would have been. Otherwise, no other negative things to say.Great little place, and definately will be going back."}
{"text":"Finally tried Bon Bon! I'd recommend it and will return. The vibe is nice--extremely hipster, but not in a bad way! ;)  I had the chicken pesto croissant sandwich with a side of Brussels sprouts. Tasty. I wish the sandwich had come with cheese though. I'd add it if I ever got that sandwich again!  My brunch date ordered the corned beef hash, which was more chunky than hash-y, so he did some extra cutting to make it more hash-like. It was a huge portion, so he has leftovers to eat for breakfast the next day or two! It came with a breaded, deep fried egg on top. Sort of over the top, but definitely fun! He also got a side of pancakes which were surprisingly melt-in-your-mouth delicious.   Apparently the coffee was excellent (I don't drink coffee but trust that opinion!). No complaints about a wait to eat, get our food, or use the bathroom, but this was a Monday."}
{"text":"Awesome food, can get a little crowded and the wait can be long so make sure you cal ahead of time."}
{"text":"When we arrived, the wait staff placed us on a wait list.  Our actual wait was 50 minutes when we were told 35, and they seated several parities the same size as ours before us.  Once we got our food, the waitress forgot to put in part of our order so we had to wait extra time to eat part of our meal.  They also didn't keep up with our drinks and our coffee cups were empty for the majority of our meal.    The food was halfway decent, but the waiter with the pig tattoo was the only saving grace."}
{"text":"After coming here to dine for a few times already, I have to say this place is just okay. For weekend brunch, you have to come early to get a table and all your members of your party have to be present before they can seat you. The wait can be long since they do not take reservations.   I have tried their bubble and squeak, donuts, coffee and chicken or egg choices. I would say for my first time, the food was good but after that, it has been disappointing. The food has gotten way too salty and lacked any wow factor. For a well-raved place in Ohio City, I always have high expectations but not anymore. It has gotten mediocre. It's always the same for a local but for out of townies, that may be different. For a place that uses local ingredients, I think it would be beneficial to change up the choices. For example, offer new specials by season so people can taste something different than what is on the menu. It seems they do that for the pastry line but not for the food. I'm always excited to see what they have in their pastry window. Being the winner of cupcake wars, I had to try them.   Coffee is a great compliment for any pastry so having tried several times of their coffee, it has been disappointing as well. The coffee tastes burnt every time I get it so I always mirror it with cream and sugar. It's a great place to take for people out of town because after brunch, you can explore other nearby places in Ohio City such as West Side Market, Bier Market/Bar Cento, Market Garden Brewery, etc. For the locals, it's great for the first few times but it gets monotonous after."}
{"text":"Brunch all day long??? YES PLEASE!  After checking out the reviews of love it or hate it I tried it yesterday to see for myself. Love Love Love!  Walked in and greeted with a smiley \"hello!\" then seated in the afternoon sun at one of the bench tables. The set up is perfect. If you want to be in and out the front counter is accommodating while if you are seated and eating you don't feel over crowded. Our waitress was awesome and sincere. She was friendly and answered any question confidently. About the condiments...they are in the process of making their own ketchup if you were worried.   I went with my brother-also a coffee lover like myself-and we started with their french press coffee. So good. Now on to the food.  He ordered the Kitchen Sink. A cute fried poached egg was sitting on top of corned beef hash and the daily veg were potatoes, asparagus, peppers and onions. Topped with a crostini or 2. Don't think I let this slip by without trying it. Tasty and my first fried poached egg experience-this could be dangerous.  I ordered the Bubble & Squeak. Found what I was looking for!!! It was an egg on top of \"root vegetable\" which ended up being mashed potatoes with carrots...I think, but however it was prepared was delicious! It was topped with crispy bacon and garnished with brussel sprouts and bacon that were so tasty. Not sure how they were prepared but I don't care. They were amazing.  We were stuffed but couldn't leave without trying a dessert. Vanilla Creme Brulee won. A+.    It's so nice to see a great breakfast/lunch place get added to the mix in Ohio City. Good Luck Bonbon!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a rainy Saturday morning, before heading to the Westside Market.  The server seated me right in front of the entrance door, I asked if I could be moved a little further away from the door.  Instead of moving me to a different table, he pushed the table approx 2-3 inches away from the door, even though there were ample empty tables (oh well).  I ordered the Bubble & Squeak, which arrived shortly thereafter, little disappointed that it didn't come with some sort of bread.  So I requested bread....I asked, can I have some toasted bread, baguette, foccacia, english muffin?   The server said, I'll bring you foccacia....he arrives with a 4-5\" piece of warm baguette, no butter, no jam.   I kind of felt like he thought that I wouldn't know the difference and because I was charged an additional $1.50 for the baguette, it would have been nice to have butter and jam (I'm just sayin').  Anyway, on to the actual meal.  The Bubble & Squeak was nicely prepared, lots of halved brussel sprouts and other root veggies, topped with a poached egg and a slice of thick sliced bacon.   The veggies were cooked perfectly, especially the brussel sprouts.   I would definitely order this again, and again....All in all this was a very good meal.  The server was really odd, but other than that, this was yet again, a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm a bit guilty to admit that I have returned here twice for the seasonal french toast after trying it for the first time when the offering was the caramel apple version.  It was delicious---the toast consisted of thick slices of deliciously light bread topped with a caramel sauce, a dollop of whipped cream and (as the description certain implies) sort of an apple compote-type stuff.  The fruit, a bit strangely, were served cold although I expected them to be warmed.  On the whole, though, the dish was delicious and I would not hesitate to try any of their seasonal french toasts.  Their other offerings looked good but, as I have been (and still am, to a degree) fixated on the french toast, I can't comment personally on them.  The coffee, on the other hand, does not stand out.  I got a latte the first time I went and it was OK---the flavour of the coffee itself was fine and it was presented in a diner-style mug.  The other times I visited I stuck with plain drip, which is priced appropriately, and if I have felt inclined towards fancier coffee I stop by one of the coffeeshops within walking distance.  The service, much like the coffee, has been OK.  Some of the waitstaff seem to be friendly and show an enthusiasm for their work and what they are serving and some do not.  I hate to speculate on why the service level has seemed to variable, all I can describe are my own personal perceptions.  However, I highly recommend Bonbon but, certainly without top-notch coffee and consistent service, I can't give a full 5 stars even though, in many areas, it totally deserves it."}
{"text":"Food is fabulous.   (The negative first) Chicken or the egg: looks better than it was. The chicken was overcooked. Everything else tasted good, but the breading on the chicken was so hard it actually hurt my teeth. It also sat under the heat lamp for about 10 minutes until the other orders were ready. I'm sure that didn't help..   My mother ordered the breakfast special, scrambled eggs, bacon focaccia. She normally hates ordering eggs, but was delighted with these.   Coffee was fresh, refilled often. Server came to check on us several times, never obtrusive.   I've also ordered their harvest salad (instant favorite) with cider dressing - one of the best salads I've ever had. The squash with the kale and mozzarella, just the right amount of everything.   And today had the bubble and squeak. Beats the pants off the chicken or the eggs. I love a good poached eggs, not overdone, and the yolk with the root veggies and Brussels sprouts?  I already want it again. 4/5 , for the overcooked chicken. Certainly glad I went back after!"}
{"text":"I'm here every week and realized I never posted a review! If you promise not to take my favorite table on Saturday mornings - read on ...  My friend and I look forward to Breakfast at BonBon every Saturday before we make our pilgrimage to WSM. We started going early to catch the Breakfast Special (which is now all day) ... Perfectly cooked eggs, bacon with a touch of sweetness, house made, lightly toasted and ungodly delicious focaccia plus deep, rich French press coffee - for $6!   But my fickle head was turned, first by the seemingly innocent, $2.50 'cinnamon doughnut' which turned out to be 6 perfect pillows of fried doughy goodness sporting a cinnamon sugar coating and 3 small bowls of dipping sauces. I love chocolate, but never used the chocolate sauce - the fresh cranberry butter and the sweet vanilla mascarpone were just perfection on their own. Then, something called Breakfast Taquitos caught my eye ... 3 perfect, soft, warm flour tortillas cupping scrambled eggs, salty bacony goodness, supple slices of avocado with a touch of fresh lime and micro greens.   The food is delicious, the menu continues to evolve and each change has seemed to be for the better. We haven't tried their lunch or Happy Hour yet, but I'll be there on Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Bon Bon had something good going on!  After my unavoidable night shifts at work, I try to get myself through half the day by getting breakfast around town. It's my way of soothing my soul after a bad shift. Bon Bon has been one of my go tos.  This place just has a nice homey feel to it. It feels like I'm going to a cottage on someone's farm, and they're gonna grab some eggs from the coup and milk the cows for me. They've got the basics, you can do a simple eggs, meat, toast and coffee for cheap. But I go for the artisan stuff. They'll do omelets however you want. The best part, I think, is their use of fontina cheese, one of my favorites. My friend had the bubble and squeak. Yeah weird name, but it was tasty. She said it was the best bacon she's had.  They have some good veggie options. Their tofu hash is vegan too. I added fontina to it of course tho :D My only complaint is that they make their food a little on the greasy side. Also, besides the cheaper breakfast special, it can be a little pricey here, just for breakfast. Anyway, love this place and will be back a bit."}
{"text":"5 stars if you order the Steak and Eggs and the French toast and split them with yo gurl over a game of scrabble. Probably 3.5 stars if you do anything else. But I'm gonna assume you'll do the right thing."}
{"text":"I still really like Bonbon, although I've only stopped in for sweets and coffee as of late (no reason, I just have had a very strong sweet tooth as of late).  At any rate, Bonbon's eclairs boot-stomps all other eclairs into nothingness.  One bite, and it's \"Holy f**k is this good!\"  Two bites and it's, \"Oh my God, #$$*# #@*#%& expletive $&@*$!!!1!11\"  Then, after the third bite, you forget about all similar pastries you may have enjoyed in the past. This thing wipes them from your memory like it just waved one of those Men In Black memory erasers in front of your face.  The filling is amazing (I ate a small bowl of it once just because it's that good, the chocolate components are awesome, and the overall experience is the desert equivalent of Wednesday evening sex--when you eat one of these, it's business time.   A Bonbon eclair is the real deal folks.  If you disagree, then you're just wrong and the terrorist probably win, or something like that."}
{"text":"Awful. What a sore in Ohio City's culinary culture.   My husband and I decided to go to Bonbon for breakfast after our weekly jaunt to the West Side Market. I can't deny it's a cute little space and the decorations were adorable. However, there is more to a dining experience than decor and atmosphere.   First the girl behind the counter asks if we will be dining in or taking out. We said dining in and instead of getting menus and seating us she walks away. A few minutes later Mr Hipster with a tude finally seats us. We order our coffee. As seems consistent it was cold. I love french press coffee however in a restaurant setting unless you have a press per table it doesn't work so well. Anyways. It took 10 minutes to get any coffee so I really shouldn't complain. It took another 10 for Mr I'm too cool to work here to ask for our order. I ordered the bacon bacon and eggs. My husband ordered the cinnamon pancakes.   About 30 minutes later (yes really 30 minutes) we received our food. I could tell right away the bacon and the pork belly had been cooked to death. Not just to crispy bacon goodness. . . scorched. The bacon tasted off. . . as in we added fake liquid smoke to our bacon to make it taste like it is artisan smoked gourmet bacon (guess what there are those of us who can tell the difference). Then the eggs. They were not properly seasoned (lots of black pepper and no salt), but that was the least of their problems. They were severely under-cooked. Not just runny yolk underdone. Slimy underdone. I sent them back as well the last thing anyone wants is e. coli. I get them back after they were microwaved. Yup microwaved. In the mean time I tried the pork belly which had been killed twice once at slaughter and once in the kitchen. It was braised then fried to death. My husband's pancakes were dry and doughy which is a difficult thing to do both over and under-cooked. Gross. They were not sweet and the syrup lacking. The apple compote was barely warmed. When all was said and done and our waiter picked up two plates barely touched he didn't even ask what was wrong with the food. We had not once been asked how things were again very disappointed in the service.  It took 10 minutes on a not busy morning just to get the server's attention to have the eggs sent back. Now while sitting there watching we noticed the hipsters all getting great service while my husband and I, a black couple sitting at a close table and 2 other sets of the yuppie type get treated like garbage. In a service business things like this make me so mad when anyone gets sub-par service. People are there paying for your service and you are being paid to be nice to everyone even the people different from you.   I will never be going back. There is no way they could redeem themselves after such an experience. I have never left a 25 dollar breakfast for 2 so dissatisfied and pray I never do again."}
{"text":"Michael and I have been to Bonbon a few times for breakfast and have loved it. I usually get the Breakfast Special which includes eggs, bacon, and some of the best foccacia around. The Western New Yorker in me is tickled to see Genesse Beer on the menu (plus you can get it for breakfast!) The coffee is great (french press) and so are the scones. I brought scones to work a few weeks ago and they were a hit!  Michael raved about the Biscuits and Gravy which were far from the traditional \"Bob Evans style\" that you can get just about anywhere. The sauce was light, with sweet sausage, and the brioche biscuits would have been awesome on their own.  Michael was looking for a birthday cake for my 40th, and Courtney and company at Bonbon hit it out of the park. They designed a beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired carrot cake that was as delicious as it was nice to look at. I had to upload a picture of it!  We'll definitely be back for pastries, cake, and breakfast sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a Saturday morning breakfast before heading over to do the Christmas Story house thing. Walked in the front door around 09:30. The place was hoppin', people backed up to the entrance. We only had to wait about 5 minutes before we were seated, not bad.  Giant ceilings, huge windows, a picture of a woman in her bra by the front register, succulents at the tables, it's kitschy without being pretentious but appears to struggle to find its personality. It sort of reminded me of some of the cafes I've frequented in San Francisco and Baltimore. It's a place where hipsters with money (yupsters?) come when they wanna feel cool. I liked it alright.  The menu is purposefully short with a focus on the first two meals of the day. It was early, we went with breakfast.  French-pressed coffee - Not a bad cup of Joe. I thought it was a tad cold for my taste, but the flavor was there. I've never been a huge fan of French press because of all of the sediment.  Breakfast special - the special is two eggs, any style, bacon, two wedges of focaccia. The eggs were cooked a perfect over-easy, not sure about focaccia with breakfast though and the bacon, ordered crisp by my wife, was floppy and fatty.  Yogurt parfait - more of a Greek yogurt sundae in a bowl than a parfait, this was a tasty one. I'm trying to eat healthier so I made this part of my meal. Two large scoops of unsweetened Greek-style yogurt, sweetened granola, chocolate chips, craisins, and some cooked, cinnamon apples. Filling, tons of protein and a great workout for the jaw.  Herb & fontina omelet - I didn't quite understand the mixed green salad with beets (beets?! really?), the omelet was mostly egg whites, which I didn't mind, but it was underseasoned. There are no salt shakers at the tables so I cut up some of my wife's bacon to make up for the shortcoming. This dish was just OK. I found the fresh herbs in the omelet to be on the grassy side and the eggs were slightly overcooked.  Silver dollar pancakes - 5 smallish pancakes, very spicy (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.), served with a side of (flabby) bacon, some maple syrup and a small pile of cinnamon apples. My wife is a bit of a pancake nut and she really liked this rendition. A very fall-like flavor profile.  Bonbon is a classy option for breakfast but I wasn't moved to start thinking about my return visit. The food we had was just OK but there were several novice missteps that negatively impacted my experience. I think I'm also too much of a traditionalist when it comes to breakfast to be wowed by eggs served with a salad. Service was friendly enough and laid back albeit a tad on the lethargic side. I have a feeling that the pastries and other sweets would be delicious but given our average experience I might be hard pressed to make my way back to try them."}
{"text":"Went to Bon Bon for brunch on a Sunday.  The space is charming and well-appointed.  The owners have obviously put a lot of effort in to making this a comfortable brunch spot.  The service was very friendly but relatively slow.  The server can't be blamed for food taking too long, but it also took 15 minutes for coffee drinks to be delivered.  Two fellow diners ordered lattes, one soy and one daily special.  Both drinks were served at room temperature, which is unacceptable for a $5 beverage. Our food arrived after a half-hour wait (which was after waiting 15 minutes for the coffee drinks).  The chocolate french toast was quite good.  The taquitos and herbed omelet were merely adequate in flavor, and fell well short in portion size. I think portion size can generally be overlooked if the quality of the food is high, but that wasn't the case here.  This rankled especially considering the $12 cost of three limp and mostly empty tacos, and the $10 cost of a slight omelet with a few green leaves as a side. The overall effect was a bit amateurish for a restaurant that obviously aspires to be an upscale cafe.  There are simply too many other superior options in the neighborhood (Petit Triangle and Flying Fig spring directly to mind) to consider a return visit to Bon Bon unless price point or quality are improved."}
{"text":"Did someone say fried poached egg atop corned beef hash.  I mean what more could a girl ask for. I know, some of the best creme brûlée around Cleveland. Im not gonna lie everything wasn't perfect I will admit the cheesecake had a very weird consistency it was almost like a ball of heavy glue. Other than that little bump in the road this place is magically delicious"}
{"text":"Had another wonderful breakfast here! Arrived at 9 AM with no wait and plenty of parking. Had the donut appetizer which was amazing! Chicken or the egg which was covered in Hollandaise sauce was very good. This food is exceptional."}
{"text":"I love this place. At least, I want to so, so badly. The food is great, Ryan's menu is awesome. Today he wasn't there and my food was still good. They have all the standards and some really unique options on a menu that isn't too small or too big. I'm just so fed up with the service here. It's a joke. Place is half empty, at least three (maybe four) servers working and we sat and waited 5 minutes just to be acknowledged. Our server seemed like she was coming off hard drugs or something. Seriously. It seemed that just speaking was causing her physical pain. Food was good but my partner's breakfast potatoes didn't come out until she was almost done with breakfast and were fried bricks. At least she took them off the ticket. It's just BAD. I've been in the industry for 15 years. This place is so close to being perfect, they just really need some decent help and, most importantly, a front of house manager to actually train these people."}
{"text":"Bon Bon is the only place I've found to meet friends for breakfast in the early mornings. They get quite busy during typical brunch hours which is understandable because of how great everything is. The staff is very welcoming and has a good vibe. The menu has so many lunch and breakfast options it's a great place to take anyone. They also have a baked good area. I would recommend getting a latte and enjoy time with friends."}
{"text":"The food is good and the pastries are great but I have to admit the coffee an juice are a huge disappointment. Now I know 3 stars seems a bit harsh but when I order coffee and orange juice at a primarily breakfast/brunch cafe I expect it to be delicious. The coffee tastes like it came from a Keurig and they give you the orange juice in the 16oz tropicana bottle... Come on guys, you're better than this!"}
{"text":"Amazing food makes up for the mediocre service. The hostess didn't seem to know how to manage tables as there were two separate couples sitting at a large table while two seat table tops were unoccupied. This with the aloof service from our waitress is probably why we waited almost a half hour even with a short line. Food was phenomenal and the chefs shouldn't take any blame for Bonbon not receiving a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast special here: Two eggs, two pieces of focaccia, and 2 large pieces of candied bacon. Excellent! The coffee is quite good also for not specializing in it.   *I stayed at the nearby Cleveland Hostel, so breakfast was only $5. Normally it's $6.95 but still very good!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend because of the media they had generated by wining cupcake wars. We decided to drop in and pick you a few tasty items for the weekend. We purchased four items which consisted of two macaroons. The lemon lavender and vanilla macaroons were amazing....we also ordered the smores and the chocolate and peanut butter bar. Unfortunately these two deserts fell flat for us. The s'more was stale and not very sweet. The peanut butter bar was u flavorful and lacked giving us the great enjoyment while eating it. We ended up discarding the majority of the last two mentioned deserts! The service was not very friendly which made me give them a 2 star review. I would give them a 2.5 if yelp allowed but since they don't I have to stick to a 2 star because personally I don't feel they deserved a three, however I might stop in and grab a few more macaroons in the future."}
{"text":"Drool-worthy experience updates are as follows:   - Bubble & Squeak: Yes. Just order it. Savory sauteed brussel spouts hang out with crispy bacon bits, a gloriously flavorful bed of root veggies, all topped off with a poached egg. I mean, I might change my middle name to \"bubble & squeak.\" My new name starting today is: Cara Bubble & Squeak Lageson. Deal with it.   - Breakfast Sandwich: First, can you really top a freshly baked English muffin? Doubt it. If you order this, please be prepared to unhinge your jaw to get it down--and trust me, it's worth it. I've only snuck bites of my bf's sammie, but if I wasn't watching my girlish figure, this would be a must-consume on a weekly basis, for realsies. We've been late to important functions because we've had to stop to get this bad boy as take out. It's that serious.  - Bakery: This is what Courtney and Bonbon are known for, so if you don't taste some goodies, you're shooting yourself in the foot. This past visit required a little take-home box filled with little treats. The macaroons can't be described any other way than heavenly. The consistency is spot on: the slightest, baby crunch on the very outside, soft and chewy on the inside {insert drool here.} I tried the peanut butter, almond and hazelnut with not one complaint, minus my waistline. But they're made from egg whites, so I'm not that worried. I also tried the biscotti, which was tasty. But nothing topped these strawberry jelly bar things--I have no idea what they were called, but think a mixture between a homemade fruit snack and the consistency of those candy orange slices. Mmmmhmmmm, that's right."}
{"text":"The place is really cute, I'll give it that. However, the food left me wanting. I ordered the Chicken or the Egg. The portion was absurdly small for the amount I paid. It was relatively flavorless, and the chicken was so overdone I had a difficult time eating it. My boyfriend has the Cleveland Philly and was of the opinion that Arby's made a better one. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had high expectations prior to going to this place because of the local reviews...and here is what happened:  First order was a MACCHIATO. The first thing the male server said to me (in a snooty tone) was, \"this isn't like Starbucks....\" I appreciated the heads up but his tone was awful. On a positive note, the drink was great! The rest of the staff seemed very friendly.   Next up EGGS BENEDICT. Looked picture perfect! Stunning presentation! The first egg was perfectly cooked but there was an overpowering vinegar taste. The second egg was over cooked and the yolk was all dried up. The potatoes were a little dry on the outside but the insides were soft and moist (I know, moist is an awful word).    My husband ordered the MORNING TACOS.  3 hearty sized breakfast tacos filled with delicious goodness. He loves to eat but was only able to finish 2 of the 3 (lucky for me!!!).  I spent $10 at the bakery and it was all phenomenal! You can't go wrong with the sweets."}
{"text":"Stopped by Bonbon for breakfast on a snowy Saturday morning.  Overall, I was really impressed by the restaurant space.  The food was of solid quality and tasted very good but admittedly short of anything particularly spectacular.  I really liked the space that Bonbon was in--a small restaurant with 12 tables for seating around 30 people.  The layout was spacious, though, and did not feel at all cramped.  The black and white color scheme, ceilings fans, and fresh flower at each table gave it the feeling of a cafe in a trendy boutique hotel, while the black wooden bench and chairs exuded a sense of familiarity and comfort.  I also liked the square white dishware to match the overall style of the restaurant.  The cardamom and chocolate muffin to start was decent, with a rich chocolate taste accented by spice.  Unfortunately, the muffin was on the dry side.  The herbed omelet was also good but definitely short of great:  I think a great French herb omelet should be just a tiny bit runny and be finished with thin layers rolled over each other rather than the folded-over half-circle I got.  I suppose the Fontina cheese helped tie the omelet together, but that takes away from the taste and aroma of the herbs.  The omelet comes with a small salad of tossed greens with halves of grapes and red peppers--a welcome side as opposed to some version of fried potatoes.  So, yeah, the food was not unbelievable, but there is something to be said for being able to eat good food in a nice and well-thought-out environment.  On top of that, my final bill before tip came to a very reasonable ten dollars and change.  I definitely wouldn't be complaining if there were more places like Bonbon Cafe in town."}
{"text":"I previously wrote a review on this place that was positive, but had to go back and edit it after my experience Sunday.  Worst. service. ever.    We got there 10 minutes before the kitchen was closing before brunch.  I understand that is frustrating, but the lady at the counter was extremely rude about it  and the first thing the waitress said was 'kitchen is closing in 10 minutes.'  We gave her our food orders immediately.  I couldn't help but notice how unprofessional this waitress was.  She messed up the order at another table - overheard her say she was going to fix it, then repeated the order back wrong twice - then was confrontational with kitchen staff.  The guys in the kitchen seemed to be working hard and the food was good, but bad service ruins good food.  I ordered the french toast....was not aware I also had to order syrup.  When I asked the waitress for syrup, she said 'it will cost you $2,' which I think is ridiculous, as you clearly need syrup with this french toast and thought the attitude was completely unnecessary.   We asked for more coffee and the water that was initially requested and never received after we got our food.  Couldn't help but notice the waitress took a detour and stood in the kitchen eating her own food for a few minutes before she bothered to stop by and refill the coffee that was completely empty.  I noticed the waitress eating several times while we were there, including when there was food in the window that needed to be delivered to tables.  She acted like she was in a club....laughing loudly, skipping around, arguing and acting gossipy with co workers.....completely unprofessional and clearly did not want to be bothered with her customers.  The only time the waitress was prompt was when she collected our bill.  Granted, she didn't wait until everyone was done eating before giving the bill and didn't bother clearing dirty plates when she collected the bill....it was obvious she just wanted her money.  I was with 2 other people and we all have years of experience in the food service industry and tip well (over 20%).  It killed me to leave over 15% for this awful service.  When we left, no one said goodbye, no one said thank you...the waitress just stood there giving side eye, as if she was the one that had been mistreated.  I plan on telling everyone that will listen about my poor experience here.  Absolutely unacceptable service."}
{"text":"This place looks nice and inviting upon walking in. We were greeted by a soft-spoken girl, who happened to also be our waitress. We both ordered coffee, and debated over the menu for a bit. Eventually we landed on each getting a daily soup (curried chicken, vegetable, and quinoa) and splitting a sunshine salad.   The soup came out first, and was swoon worthy. There were ample amounts of veggies, quinoa, and chicken all in a savory rich broth. About the same time that I was debating liking out the bowl, our salad came out, but unfortunately it wasn't the salad we ordered. I hate when restaurants waste food, so we decided to eat it anyway. We discovered we got the harvest salad that was mysteriously missing figs, and had an absolutely terrible dressing. Once we got some ranch instead it was good, but I had a bunch of wilted leaves in my salad.  Finally, I saw that they had previously won Cupcake Wars, so I had to try a cupcake! We ordered the carrot cake, and it was woefully disappointing. It came out chilled, so the frosting was rock hard and tasted like sweetened butter. The cupcake itself was kind of dry and was overly sweet to my taste.   I did, however, appreciate the staff discounting our salad for the mistake and being generally johnny on the spot with refills. I'm not sure I would go back.... unless they had that soup on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great place for real croissants, none-of-that-ACME,Giant Eagle stuff I've been eating for four years,boy do I miss living overseas; European look, huge french windows,ceiling fans, small tables, neat, real flowers,but service was a bit off. It's a new cafe, so they have to tweak it a bit to make it happen, if you know what I mean.  Should've had the french press coffee with breakfast,but I didn't realize I was going to eat breakfast until I took the first bite of the last two croissants that were kindly resting for us in the bakery. I ordered fried eggs with the breakfast special,but instead got boiled eggs, runny inside,breaded on the outside,but was pleasantly surprised-it went well with the cider bacon, foccacia,and cappuccino. My significant other was not too happy about her herb omelet with some kind of runny cheese inside.I was told I make better omelets at home...oh well, c'est la vie."}
{"text":"The decor is kinda plain and the food is just ok for the price. Had the bubble and squeak and the chicken and the egg. Both were good for sure."}
{"text":"This place has always been on my list of places to try in Cle. For my birthday my husband and I took our 3 month old daughter on a Tuesday after the lunch rush, about 1:30-ish. Besides for a tight walkway and step up into the restaurant, it was baby friendly. The coffee was so good I didn't need cream or sugar. The waiter recommended the breakfast sandwich and french toast. We both got the breakfast sandwich (usually we get 2 different things to try and share, but it sounded THAT good) we split some cinnamon doughnuts and got pastry to go. Wow wow wow WOW. All I kept thinking is how have we not been here sooner? The atmosphere reminds me of some of our favorite NYC joints and the food easily stood up. We both loved it and I'm not going to lie, I brought my out of town friend the following week. She had the breakfast nachos (huge bowl, looked fantastic, nothing what I pictured) and I had chorizo biscuits, another terrific, very flavorful dish. The pastry was out of this world also. I'm a huge macaroon fan and we tried key lime pie, absolutely delicious. I'm not a huge cupcake lover, but my husband insisted on trying the Boston Cream Pie, and some very chocolatey one and they both made me swoon. They were moist and small so I didn't feel like a pig. I don't even like cupcakes but I would have eaten 10 more in less than 5 minutes if they were in front of me. The place seems to always have a small crowd, even at the off times when you would expect it to be empty, so I can only imagine it is more busy during traditional lunch/breakfast hours, and I'd stay away from Sunday brunch time because I'd imagine people are beating the door down. Service was stellar although the 2nd visit we had to flag someone down for a check and noticed another table had to as well. Hopefully your experience is as nice as mine!"}
{"text":"Went in here on a busy Saturday afternoon. Food was delicious. We got the breakfast sandwich and eggs Benedict. Both very good. I really like this place but the service is kind of slow. After we ordered I never got a refill on my coffee until I was almost done with my meal and she never checked back on us once we got our food. Everybody was very nice and I really like the place just would like to see a little better customer service."}
{"text":"Arrived with a large group, asked about the cheeseburger special. After the server shared in detail what was on the cheeseburger ( cheddar, BBQ sauce, onion ring, with NO mention of bacon), I ordered it well done. When the burger arrived it had a few strips of bacon on it, no onion ring or slaw. I shared with the server that I don't eat Bacon, for religious reasons, she took the burger back only to remove the bacon and return with the same burger. I then had to ask them it was not appropriate just to remove, but it should have been remade. With significant attitude from the server and then the cooks when the server took the burger back. The remade burger was okay. Nothing too special, didn't have the onion ring as advertised. The curly fries are usually good. Probably better to stick to the chicken or the egg or pancakes as the better options... And avoid the server we had for a better experience. Would give one star, but have been here countless times without problems so will give 2 because of history.  Don't know if I'll be returning anytime soon after today."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Came here over the weekend and it was exactly what I was hoping it would be- a very cute place to sit and enjoy your company. We sat outside because it was such a nice day, but the decorating inside is really cute, clean, and fresh.   Coffee here was very good. Its french press, and solid. The dishes we got included Bubble & Squeak Vanilla Bean French Toast Herbed Omelet  French toast wasn't the greatest, but the other two I would happily order again. We also got the mini cinnamon sugar donuts to share and they were deeeeeelicious.  What a good excuse to have breakfast dessert. When we went up to the counter to order, all the pastries looked so good that I had a hard time settling for just that though. I will have to come back at least just for pastries and coffee so I can try all the rest."}
{"text":"I've been to Bon Bon several times and the chorizo and biscuits with fresh fruit is my favorite with the breakfast special right behind it. I've also tried several desserts and I love the macaroons! The coffee is also delicious."}
{"text":"Get the deviled egg and creme brulee!  Came here at 3pm with some friends. I walked in and just loved the atmosphere. I didn't feel like I was in Ohio City... felt like I was in Europe or somewhere cute, cool, and relaxing. Anyway, I ordered off the happy hour menu and i was not a bit disappointed.  Hot Chocolate (4): Yum! Just the right amount of chocolate!  Deviled Egg(5): this isn't just your typical deviled egg. It's picked devil egg or something like that. The egg has been marinated/soaked so it was orange with the egg yolk. anyway, it was deviled egg with a special taste to it. SO worth trying.  Creme Brulee (4): ok.. creme brulee is my favorite dessert of all time and Bonbon made it well. I did however, thought the carmelized sugar was too hard but still, it was delicious.  I'll be back, BonBon! Thanks for existing."}
{"text":"This is a cute little pastry shop. We tried the chocolate raspberry cupcake and brown sugar cheesecake ball."}
{"text":"Forget the cupcakes for a second and focus on the food. The chicken gouda sandwich I had for lunch was delicious! I'm a sucker for caramelized onions and gouda cheese and this sandwich did not disappoint, it was so flavorful. Also, the side salad with apple cider vinaigrette was so fresh.   How did I not eat here sooner? I guess I thought it was just a breakfast/cupcake shop. But no, they had so much more to offer."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved the breakfast. Imaginative. Had the chicken and egg, which was very tasty with unique flavors. Fresh pastry was nice. Eggs Benedict were fabulous and the potatoes definitely rocked. The only problem was a patron who walked through and hadn't showered in a week. Will return as soon as we visit Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"I tried the croissants.  Sorry Blackbird but I might have a new favorite.  Holy cow.  I was so mad that I had only bought one.  So I went back the next day to get another one.  They were sold out.  Went back today.  They were sold out of regular yet again, but they did have the chocolate ones.  I bought two with the intention of giving the other one away.  Yahhhhh....I ate both on the fifteen minute car ride to my parents."}
{"text":"This place is maddeningly good and a welcomed new spot in Ohio City!  I have been here three times now, including their grand opening gala, and have been impressed with every single item I've tried from their baked goods to brunch items.  My absolute favorite would be their savory Bubble and Squeak dish; a patty of vegetables and herbs topped with a perfectly poached egg, bacon and a maple glaze surrounded with the tastiest Brussels sprouts, also coated in the bacon pieces and the maple glaze. It's hand's down incredible. Their coffee is also very good, their own blend that they also sell retail, served up freshly french pressed.  I'll be going back and recommending it to anyone looking for a memorable meal."}
{"text":"Breakfast so ridiculously good it might be my new fave brunch spot. We had the chorizo breakfast nachos and they were amazing. It was a very inventive take on nachos. Topped with chorizo, veggies, cheese and egg. Salsa on the side. And all over nachos. My bf had the spinach, mushroom and cheese omelette. We had a cruller to share and that was fresh and delicious too."}
{"text":"Delicious iced-coffee! They got it just right -- not watery, cold-brewed. The staff there was incredibly nice, striking up light conversation that made me feel incredibly welcome.   The eggs benedict was excellent as well. The hollandaise sauce, the poached eggs, and the ham on top of english muffins really hit the spot. The sauce has a delicious unexpected kick to it as well - definitely filled me up!   This place is a great place for a one-on-one brunch of a mid-day snack (that's what I did!)."}
{"text":"This cafe has a cute atmosphere but charges $3 for a lukewarm coffee? I think not! There's also inconsistent pricing on their menu board vs the printed menus which doesn't exactly exude professionalism and makes the customer feel stupid for questioning their bill. I still need to try their breakfast entrees, so I can't judge them on their food quality yet. On a side note, they really need to water their cute potted succulents on the tables - they're withering away!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch spot in cle.    I have been meaning to come here for the longest and finally on Sunday I did! Came with a group of 6 at 1pm and they said the wait would be around an hour- it wasn't, more like 30 min.  We sat right infront of the bakery and opted for some pre brunch desserts (DUH, how could we resist??)  3 of us got the chicken or the egg ... Oh. My. Goodness. Heaven in my mouth. The best brunch meal I have ever experienced. If u don't get this ur missing OUT.  Another friend got the BLT which was huge and very satisfying, corn beef hash which was very yummy and the eggs benny which was fab!  Overall this place blew my tastebuds away!! I love you Bon Bon"}
{"text":"Every meal I've had here has been fantastic. Both breakfast and dinner. The grilled rosemary focaccia is amazing. Really wonderful pastries too."}
{"text":"Bonbon is unduly hyped in my opinion, since both the pastries and the brunch missed the mark for me.  I have gotten pastries here a few times, and overall, I am unimpressed:  I am not a fan of the macarons here. I have had a lavender and a passion fruit. I was excited to try them because the flavors sounded unique. Unfortunately, both of them were very bland, and I could not taste the main ingredients at all. My main gripe is that they are filled with a a thick layer of heavy buttercream that I believe detracts from the delicateness of this dessert.  As an avid viewer of Food Network's \"Cupcake Wars,\" I was so excited to try the confections of a winner. However, I have tried the s'mores cupcake with a marshmallow frosting and a chocolate cupcake with raspberry frosting, and both not bad but were not above average.  I tried two cookie sandwiches: a s'more and a chocolate raspberry \"Oreo.\" I was so tempted by the lovely-looking s'more, and I thought it would be fun to try one made by a professional baker. Honestly, this was worse in flavor than what you could make at home because these graham crackers were so soggy and had an off-putting, \"cardboardy\" taste. The raspberry Oreo was better. The chocolate cookie itself was tasted good, and had a nice crumbly texture, but the raspberry buttercream was too heavy for my taste.  There was one very tasty pastry that I tried, and that was the eclair. This was not a long doughnut being marketed as an eclair; this was the traditional French kind. It was great! All the elements of it, from the pastry itself, to the custard filling, to the dark chocolate glaze were absolute delicious, and were just as good as eclairs I ate in Paris!  Overall, these pastries were not enough to bring me back to this shop. However, I came here for brunch with a friend yesterday because she was curious to see how it was. I went in with an open mind, hoping to be impressed. We arrived on a Saturday at about 11, and there was about a 15-20 minute wait.  I had a hot apple cider to drink. It was not too sweet and had a nice flavor, and came a little bit frothy, which was a nice touch. My friend ordered the \"Chicken or the Egg,\" but asked to replace the fried chicken with a veggie patty. The waitress said that they didn't normally like to do substitutions, but when she asked, the cooks agreed, which was kind. Although I didn't try it, she said she liked it. I ordered the tofu hash, since our waitress told us that it was her favorite item on the menu. This was essentially a vaguely-Asian flavored tofu stir-fry with brussels sprouts, potatoes, onions, carrots, and peppers. It had a pretty good flavor, but nothing special. I was disappointed to notice that my dish was a little bit cold. This was a bit off-putting, and because of that and because the dish itself was lackluster (although it was supposedly the brunch menu's standout dish), I don't think I will be coming back here for another meal.  My conclusion: This is an overrated cafe. To me, this is a greasy spoon marketed as gourmet establishment. There are much, much better brunches and pastries around town."}
{"text":"Overall, good experience. The staff was friendly (I thought, I know many reviews said otherwise).  I mean, they don't act fake, but they are not rude either.    Went on a Saturday at about 10:30.  Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  Very few tables!   I loved my iced coffee w/shot of vanilla.  I got the pesto chicken on a croissant and a side salad.  The salad was good and fresh.  Simple but yummy!   They have good ranch dressing too.  I could eat a barrel of that salad.  The pesto chicken had pros and cons. Pro- it was loaded with fresh large hunks of chicken!  Con- even with pesto it was a bit bland tasting and a little dry.  It needs cheese or something.  Maybe salt the pesto a little.    My mom got the chorizo omelet and I tried it.  This was tasty good!    I so wanted to try some bakery... But I was way too full!  Next time for sure as it all looked amazing!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and I like it well enough.  The food is good too, but I don't feel it's good enough to give that extra star. I had the bubble and squeak, which is most popular. I also have tried the corned beef hash and the egg, bacon special for 6.50.   The bacon is quite awesome- crispy and meaty, the 2 most important qualities of any bacon I will eat.   Their food is quite unique and very fresh. I would recommend to anybody. The french press coffee is a little weak for my liking, but good enough. I have had the eclair, which is to die for. More recently I tried the cassada cupcake which was eh. I don't think I'll get it again. Not their best.   Cute cafe with delectable-looking pastries and decent breakfast! Give it a try and you just might like it."}
{"text":"A great breakfast place, and within walking distance to the Westside market. It's a small, cozy, but modern place with good food. The only issue I have with the place is parking. The place gets crowded pretty fast during breakfast time, so most likely you will have to search for street parking.   If you are a coffee lover, you should definitely get the French press coffee. Nothing like a good, strong cup of coffee to start your day!  My friends and I got the chocolate hazelnut french toast, a breakfast sandwich, and the eggs benedict (refer to pictures posted). The french toast was very rich, but delicious and perfect for those that have a sweet tooth. I like to have something sweet mixed in with the saltiness of the other dishes. The breakfast sandwich was a bit heavy, especially with the cream on top of the bread with grilled ham and cheese. The eggs benedict was pretty good, I had no complaints. Next time I'll probably try more of their pastries. Overall, it's a good place for brunch, and unlike other breakfast places, their coffee is not diluted! Thank goodness!!"}
{"text":"A pretty terrible experience. I tried to grab a quick breakfast here, so I came in at 8:00 on a Saturday. There was one person responsible for about 8 seated tables, so it took a while to get seated and get the food in.   I ordered the simple breakfast (I forget the real name), but it was bacon, eggs, and coffee. The eggs were pretty bland and the bacon was average at best. There's nothing to write home about, and for the price should just be skipped.  However, the worst part came at the end of the meal. After asking for the check it took the guy about 10 minutes to bring the check, then another 10 minutes to ring it up. So I was forced to sit around for 20 minutes twiddling my thumbs as this guy served every other person in the place as if he had totally forgotten about me.  Then, I realized they had over charged me by almost double for my order, so I had to wait around and get that fixed. All in all it took me about 25-30 minutes from the time I was done eating to actually leave the place, which is completely unacceptable.  TL; DR: Bland food, crappy service.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for Brunch and was blown away. We heard the place was small, so our group of five called ahead to ask about the wait. When we strolled in around 3-4pm, they had saved a table for us and the place wasn't packed at all. So we were seated right away, greeted immediately, and I took a glance at the menu. Upon this glance, I realized I was gonna have a really tough time ordering. Everything looked so. gosh darn. delicious.   I finally made a choice (I'm a sucker for a good breakfast sandwich and some iced coffee). Everyone else ordered something different and when the food came (within 10 min), we were all in heaven. The maple sausage on my sandwich was seriously SO GOOD. I picked off of my friends plates as well and I loved the brussels sprouts, too. Anyway, it was all so tasty.  Bonbon is easily one of the best brunches I have had in awhile. The service was also great. Attentive, friendly, super conversational. Our group had a really good time. Next time I'm in Cleveland I will be back to try some sweeter stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"Place is great! Service was outstanding! Bakery items we tried were great."}
{"text":"I usually order from Gypsy Beans for super important meetings that require fancy pastries.  However, I wanted to try something different and I have heard so many good things about Bonbon, plus they were featured on Food Network's \"Cupcake Wars\" and won so the pastries had to be phenomenal right? Well, they were delicious, but for the price I paid I expected better.  I ordered pastries and fruit salad for 30 people and the total came to $240.  That is fine and all, but the previous week I ordered the same thing for 50 people for the same price from Gypsy Beans.  Furthermore, I was a little disappointed with the variety.  I only received chocolate croissant, plain croissant, Cheese Danish w/ Orange Marmalade, and Mini Muffins. Don't get me wrong, the chocolate croissant was one of the best I have ever had, but the price was just not worth it."}
{"text":"Wanted some breakfast before heading to the market and so we tried Bon Bon. It's within walking distance so we parked at the market and just walked. Has a very cool urban atmosphere. The kids and I had breakfast my husband got lunch. Food came out fast but server forgot an item and no one refilled our waters. Also we tried a cruller it was super doughy (maybe not cooked all the way) but other then that great little joint for breakfast/brunch if your heading to the west side market"}
{"text":"The waitstaff seemed indifferent, borderline rude, but who cares, the food was amazing. I was even able to sneak a smile out of the waitress (who we nicknamed little lurch) as we left. They were pretty busy, so I can empathize.  Here are the highlights: - While waiting, the host gave us free monkey bread, which he explained was a deconstructed cinnamon roll. I'm not sure if he was being ironic, but it was delicious.  - I got the Stacy Cakes and it was amazing. The pancakes were thin and crispy, the sausage was maple flavored deliciousness, and the eggs were scrambled perfectly.  - They give you a stainless steal creamer instead of the cheap plastic creamers.  I'll be back. Honestly, I care more about the food than the attitude of the servers. If you give me a 5-star meal, it's all good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite little spots for a local brunch. Everyone I have brought here has been happy too! My favorite thing on the menu is the Breakfast sandwich with maple bacon and a fried egg on an English muffin. It comes with tasty red skin potatoes too. The coffee drinkers tell me the french press is very good, they always get a refill. The service is hit or miss but never terrible, just sometimes less than the best. The food is usually on par and the prices are low for the area. I would recommend this spot to anyone."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I'm not really a breakfast person.  I stopped in over the weekend to brunch with some of my lady friends for our annual holiday outing.  We try to pick a restaurant that none of us have ever gone to, so off to Bonbon we went!  For some reason my phone took me in the wrong direction and I was running horribly late, but I was able to easily find street parking once I figured out where I was going.  A few of my friends were already seated, drinking their coffee when I arrived, and our waiter immediately stopped by to get my drink order.  i got a regular old coffee that ended up being just ok.  I'm no coffee snob, but there wasn't anything out of the ordinary with the coffee I had.  Once we had all arrived we decided on various breakfast and brunch items.  I went with one of the few vegetarian items on the menu - the vegetable wrap.  When it arrived, it looked more like two open faced flour tortilla tacos, but...it ended up being delicious.  I had to eat a bunch of lettuce before I could pick up my wrap/taco things but it was a minor inconvenience.    One of my friends ordered the bubble and squeak and commented on how candy-like the Brussels sprouts and bacon were.  Another friend ordered a dish that came with a  fried egg and we were all a little surprised to see that it was a whole egg that it was fried.  She really enjoyed it, though.  The only person who didn't particularly enjoy her food was my friend who ordered a chocolate croissant.  She had high hoped for it, but the chocolate on the inside was hard and it wasn't all that fresh seeming.  Throughout the meal our server was very attentive.  I'm surprised that others haven't had the same experience.  The restaurant was packed, but I saw plenty of waitstaff milling around.  If you live in the area or are looking for a slightly more upscale brunch I'd definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"We heard so many good things about this place, so we had to check it out for brunch.    And, of course to try their cupcakes, since they won cupcake wars on food network.  And finally to get a chocolate croissant and some macarons, because, well, macarons are difficult to come by in the CLE.  For brunch we had a regular breakfast sandwich and a chicken or the egg (a fried chicken breakfast sandwich).  The chicken breakfast sandwich had a bit too much sauce and the chicken itself was not particularly flavorful.  The breakfast sandwich was decent but did not really stand out.  The pastries and cupcakes?  I liked the chocolate croissant, because, well, it's a chocolate croissant.  The cupcakes, though, were kind of disappointing - perhaps we expected them to be amazing because of the cupcake wars hype, but these tasted like they had been sitting out for awhile (though we ate them as soon as we got back).  The macarons.. were kind of so-so.  All in all, this place was okay, but not amazing.  Might come back, but not too often."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town.   No, seriously! The best. And I'm not even talking about the bubble and squeak, or the pancakes. Bonbon has the best breakfast in the city for $6. It's a dream!  For $6, you get two eggs; some thick, deliciously marbled bacon; a lightly toasted triangle of fresh foccacia; and all the dark, delightful coffee you could drink. For $6. Foodies and the frugal, rejoice!"}
{"text":"i was intrigued by this place since it won cupcake wars. however the food failed to wow. i arrived bright and early in the stinking morning at 7:30ish am to get breakfast. nice thing was i didn't have any problems finding parking!  just FYI their hollandaise sauce is NOT ready this early in the morning. if you want anything with their special sauce. don't bother waking up early. i was heart broken. i had my heart set on the chicken or the egg but the sauce wasn't ready for another 30 minutes. it wouldn't be complete without the sauce!  all their coffee is french press coffee. they come in very tall mugs.  i ordered the corned beef hash. i appreciated that the waitress explained to me that it wasn't like traditional corned beef hash. this hash comes in cubes. the portion is HUGE. i mean HUGE. you literally can share it with two people. it didn't have much flavor so i ended up slathering on the \"hot sauce\" from the breakfast tacos all over it. (YUM)   my bf ordered the breakfast tacos based on the the waitress recommendations. i didn't think it was that great. the tortillas were kinda dried/hard on the edges and they weren't filled enough in my opinion. since it didn't have enough filling it disturbed the tortilla/food ratio off and your bites are filled with tortilla.  as for the cupcake. i got the cassata cupcake. it was such a disappointment! maybe i had too high hopes because they won cupcake wars. but the cassata cake was basically white cake with a glob of filled in the middle with a strawberry on top. the cake was a bit dry. not worth the calories.  overall this place has a nice open environment. windows everywhere. they had some pastries that were on the counter out in the open, i think they should cover that up! hands and people walking past coughing, sneezing, or just breathing all over them grossed me out. i'd really like to try out more of their pastries. the display case looked soooooooo GOOD  i really wanted to like this place. i really did. i like the concept and the environment, decor etc. however the food was bland and the cupcake wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Bonbon's comfortable atmosphere perfectly pairs with its un-fucking-believable cousine. I've dined at plenty of 'brunch' cafes around the area, West and East, and none match this place in terms of price and quality (many of them having one, but not the other).  French press coffee and a warm chocolate croissant before heading into work?  Yes, please.  What... do you think I came here for ketchup and eggs?  Even if you're cheap -- like me -- you're bound to find something you love at Bonbon."}
{"text":"What a waste of time, gas, and money. They're getting one star because they were able to get us seated within 10 minutes even though we were told that the wait would be 20-25 minutes.  Waitress: would you like something to drink? Me:  I'll have the Cuban coffee.   Waitress: That's basically a cup of espresso. Me: Ok???  Notice that there was no hello or welcome my name is so and so.  No smiling face, no energy.  You could barely even hear her.  I knew then this was going to be an unpleasant experience but stayed because of some of the Yelp reviews that I read.  I also drove 30 minutes to check this place out and did not have a plan b lined up.  The waitress brings me the \"Cuban coffee\".  Let's just say that she was right.  It's just a shot of expresso.  Do these people even know what Cuban coffee is?  I think not.  Waitress:  Today we have french toast with ..... Me:  Can you please repeat yourself, I did not understand. Waitress: Today we have french toast with ...... Me: Not having any idea what the French toast came with, ordered an omelette with a side of potatoes. Me: I would like a croissant.  Do you have any? Waitress: I'll have to see what we have left in the front. My sister:  Don't order anything from the bakery, there was a big fly flying around the pastries. Waitress:  That has nothing to do with me.  That right there, ladies and gentleman, is the reason why this place is going downhill.   In addition, I had to send my potatoes back because they were too salty, she also told my sister that there was a 3.00 up charge for the maple syrup, and the cups that they use to serve water and juice are old and nasty.  I would never step foot in this place ever again and Colleen our server shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I am giving Bonbon a 3 only because it's really hit-and-miss -- at just about everything: food, service, and ambiance.   At times, the small portions are right on because they are sooo flavorful, and at others they are either overdone (too much oil when cooking) or underdone (eggs too dry).   I've had both rude, impatient, and disinterested staff as well as polite and funny staff.   The space is awesome and interesting but the tables and floors are not as clean as they could be -- which kinda ruins the nifty interior design.   I really, really want to like this place -- and plan on giving it a couple more tries. I would be soooo happy if they made it big!"}
{"text":"I always find some good in restaurants that I visit. And while I appreciate the notion that a restaurant may distinguish itself in some way, sometimes that can be overdone. Such was the case with Bonbon Cafe. I ordered the pancake dish for brunch and was told when it arrived that they didn't offer syrup. Nor do they serve ketchup or butter. Our server was apologetic and mentioned that several others had complained but that they only served fresh foods that they prepared themselves. I call BS on this and believe this is the worst implementation of this concept ever!   I mentioned to the waitress that there should be a note in bold type on the menu that reads: WE DO NOT SERVE CONDIMENTS.  I guarantee that many would get up and walk out if they knew in advance.   Sadly, although they have great coffee, I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Coffee was decent but I would probably prefer going to another cafe or Starbucks for coffee.  Their breakfast was delicious!! Never had a Egg's Benedict before and so I decided to try it out here for the first time.... The atmosphere was nice and the weather was great so it was beautiful to look outside and see the sun shining... Food was kind of pricy, but I really wanted a good breakfast so it was well worth it... Would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service today. Tried it for the first time and I can't wait to go back. I wish I remembered our servers name but I can't . Lox bagel was delicious and their breakfast potatoes are out of this world!"}
{"text":"4 stars simply for the food, silver dollar pancakes w bacon and a side of potatoes... Very good, most likely will return to try other items. The service sucked."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The chicken or the egg is my favorite.. Very intimate, and the cup cakes look amazing!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Once you get over the fact that brunch is busy in Ohio City no matter what, it's a total gem. I've had the tofu hash (awesome!) as well as the sunshine salad (super refreshing). Their coffee is good and the pastries look unreal. Super into the vibes here. It's cool without being pretentious. A+"}
{"text":"Good food but always out of something. I go everyday day to see if they have monkey bread but today 6-4-14 will be the last time I go and check. There other food is okay but over priced. So not worth the trip in my opinion. What's the use of making the trip if they don't have what you want."}
{"text":"buttery goodness maple crullers and croissants bonbon très délicieux  Oh gawd.  What a treat the croissants are, as is everything else baked by Courtney Bonning.  I can't let myself indulge in these delicacies too often or I won't fit into any of my clothes, but once in a while (read - once or twice a week...) I will allow myself this guilty pleasure.    The bakery/bistro is quite stylish, with a clever homage to the Westside Market's old school signage.  Breakfast and lunch only.  Regardless of when or what I would order, I will always, ALWAYS, add an order of the \"cider bacon\".    Bonbon is yet another reason that Ohio City is the place to be.   Carry on."}
{"text":"We ate here because our hotel offered a special discounted breakfast. Like many other reviewers have said, the service wasn't good. Our server disappeared for long periods of time. When our food came up we got it right away but I saw food sitting under the warmers for other tables for at least ten minutes while several employees walked by it. The table next to us had to flag someone down to tell them their breakfast was sitting there. Also, a lid to a coffee carafe fell on the floor and the sever put it on the carafe without washing it and served coffee to people. The food was very good though. After we got our food, no one ever came back to ask if we needed anything or give us refills. It took forever to get the check. Since our server never came back, we flagged down a different server for the check. And when we got it, no discounted breakfast. We didn't want to have to wait any more so we just paid it. In spite of the food being very good, I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I came across this place when searching for breakfast before the shops inside West Side Market open at 10 am. This place was rather packed, mostly with people who seem to be taking their time with breakfast on this particular weekday.   After seeing a sign that said the place was a Cupcake War winner on Food Network, I decided to try its red velvet cupcake. The cake was moist and the frosting was creamy and rich but thankfully not too sweet. I also ordered a \"oreo\" with raspberry flavored filling, which tasted a lot lighter than I expected."}
{"text":"I have loved this quirky bakery/cafe since the days Becca was favorite my cookie dealer at farmer's markets.  The chicken tacos will floor you with its flavor and juicy meat. After the first bite, I held my taco gently so the juices wouldn't drip on anything I'd be embarassed to lick off. I can't explain it - it's amazing...I'm usually not a fan of cilantro but this taco made such good use of it I've grown to make amends with it.  The hot chocolate is awesome and so is their soy-glazed burger. So juicy and delicious. I'm also not a fan of gorgonzola cheese but it fits so well here that it doesn't feel like the zit of a flavor it normally is to me.  The only thing that I'm not a fan of, after trying over 20ish goods of theirs, is the lemon bar. I truly dig lemon bars since a kid that loved getting my hands gooey with the sticky/dry sweet/sour soft/crusty dessert. this one was a bit bland, but still quite decent."}
{"text":"Yay! Im so glad I found this joint via Yelp. If you're a brunch addict, this is where it's at. The prices are slightly intimidating early in the morning, but once the food comes, it all comes together. SO worth it. A large, open, brightly lit room with a hip wait staff, interesting menu and great food. I'd recommend the french press coffee, the maple bacon, and the bread pudding. Show up hungry!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here later on weekday mornings when it isn't bursting at its seams to contain all the people.  On those types of days, you're more likely to sit at the best table-- looking out the front window on Lorain Ave-- with all the coming and going, a couple sparrows in the trees, the Market clock tower up front, and much of the downtown skyline in the not-so-far-off distance.  Order the bubble and squeak, it is my favorite breakfast in town anywhere.  Period.  It offers all the savory and sweet you could ever want-- and will win you over from any doubts you might have about brussels sprouts for breakfast.  Sooooo good."}
{"text":"I agree with the reviews on the bad service.  The first time I tried this place there were two employees at the front.  It seemed like one was trying to show the other how to do something on the computer.  They looked up when I walked in but never acknowledged me.  Not even a smile or \"hey, one minute\".  I was kind of in a rush so I left after a couple minutes.  This was on a Wednesday, not a weekend.  It was not busy, at all.  There was no excuse. Next day, much better luck.  They sat me almost instantly.  I had the basic breakfast and also the pancakes.  Wow, oh wow those pancakes!!!  And the bacon!!!  Food came out pretty quickly too (I would hope so, there were only two other people there at 1 table).  Give it a shot, and get the pancakes and bacon, if you have time.  Seriously though, get the pancakes.  Get the pancakes, did I mention they come with pure maple syrup?  Get the pancakes and the bacon."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. The corn beef hash with Brussel sprouts is amazing. The breakfast tacos were good, actually burritos. Try a fried crueller (spelling?)"}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. Chorizo biscuits and also chocolate chip pancakes. The chorizo was pretty good. Heavy biscuits with a thick creamy gravy. Very filling dish.  The pancakes weren't anything unique but good standard dish. The maple bacon was really good though.   Had two chai lattes, they were very milky and less chai tasting than I would have hoped.   On the way out, picked up a few goodies to go. 3 macaroons and 1 chocolate cherry cupcake. The cupcake was pretty good, though I would have liked a little more cherry taste to if.   The macaroons were pretty disappointing though. The cream wasn't right, very whipped cream-esque.. And the \"crust\" was basically hollow on a couple of them. The flavor was okay, but I had higher hopes for them.   Service was fine, no complaints."}
{"text":"I am torn between giving 4 stars or 3 stars. The food was delicious BUT the service was lacking. Five of us at 1pm had to wait 45mins for a table. Finally when we were seated, half the table got water. It took a surprisingly long time for me to get a coffee. I had to ask for water then ask for refills on my water & coffee. Yes, it was busy-ish but there were other servers just hanging out at the counter. When the food came, it was beautiful and delicious! I got the egg benedict, not disappointed. Our server disappeared after that. Another server gave us our checks. The prices are a little high."}
{"text":"Bonbon is just what Ohio City needed. A slightly more accessible, yet super fancy coffee shop/restaurant thats right up my alley.         After reading so many different reviews, I had to try this place out for myself. As I waited for my friend to arrive, I ordered a pumpkin spice latte. It was ok. Nothing fantastic. We seated ourselves and were promptly greeted by a very friendly waiter. My friend ordered a vanilla soy latte, but it didn't taste like soy. So, our impression of the coffee wasn't fantastic. But what the coffee lacked, the food and service definitely made up for. I ordered the bubble and squeak, my friend had the cinnamon pancakes. The bubble and squeak consisted of  mashed potatoes and carrots topped with bacon topped with a poached egg surrounded by a maple glaze and more bacon. HOLY EFFFEN MOTHER it's the best comfort food ever. I tried the cinnamon pancakes with the bourbon glazed apples and dulce de leche, and honestly it was a bit too desserty for me. But she loved em, so that's all that matters, right?         I'll return. But I'm a broke 20-something year old, so it might be awhile."}
{"text":"Food is great, I love the atmosphere there. My only complaint is the customer service. Last time I was eating there, the waiter took my plate of food away while I was still eating."}
{"text":"ok, bonbon. you are breaking my heart. please figure out a way to store pastries so they are not totally stale. i bought a would-be delicious cinnamon pecan roll that i could barely chew. i would've taken it back but i was already too far gone. :("}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday morning around 11. They weren't particularly busy but the service was absolutely horrendous. I saw my waitress twice. When she took my drink order she took my girlfriends and didn't wait to hear mine and walked away. The food took over 35 minutes to get to the table. It was good food but not good enough for the wait or terrible service."}
{"text":"Have eaten there many times. If it's a week day and you have a small party np, charming. But today I waited 25 minutes for a large party (to be expected) before I was told it would be another hour to sit."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, food is not especially personal but it's good and mildly creative. We had a short wait on a Saturday around 1100 which was nice, staff was attentive and pleasant.  I would recommend this place for a group looking to get into some breakfast/brunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"Oh Bonbon, I want to give you a better rating. So very badly. But you fucked up today, bro.  My first experience with Bonbon was pretty awesome. It was a slushy winter weekday in early 2012, and I went in having heard amazing things about their drinking chocolate, and I ordered some for $2.50-- not bad! It came in a little espresso cup with a square marshmallow in it. I'll be damned if that was not the best chocolate beverage I've ever had in my life. It was spicy, super rich, and very nicely balanced with the sweetness of the marshmallow. This is something that all people should try in their lifetimes. I trudged across the way to my place of work and declared the glory of this beverage to my work friends, who promptly stampeded across the street to try some. Some of them came back with the hot chocolate, which is a normal medium-size serving, while others ordered the same drinking chocolate I had just enjoyed. They were raving about both beverages, so I decided to go  back later and try the hot chocolate. Well, it was equally amazing. It is super light, chocolaty but not overly rich, and has a really nice texture. Sweet but not too sweet. Another winner. Also only $2.50.  I have also sampled their awesome baked goods-- it's impossible to go wrong there. They won a Food Network competition with their cupcakes, and rightly so. Almost all of the stuff at the counter is super delicious and well worth trying.  I dig the atmosphere as well-- it's a pleasant little spot in between cafe and restaurant, where it's not weird to take out your laptop at your table but there's still a waiter to come refill your water.  So I was ready for today to be the day I wrote a five-star review for Bonbon after my first real meal there. I stopped in for a sit-down lunch and ordered the cheeseburger (I sometimes claim to be vegetarian, but I go weak at the knees when I see a burger with a fried egg and avocado). My waiter Gabe seemed a teensy bit aloof, but overall was cheery and helpful. My burger was out not super-fast, but the wait wasn't altogether unreasonable, because it was a pretty big patty, and the waiter did mention there would be a little wait for that reason.  The first bite was pure joy. The bread they use is awesome (baked in-house? dunno), the bacon had a little bit of sweetness to it, the egg was perfect, a bit runny just how i like it. The greens were delicious, lightly dressed, and clean. \"What could possibly go wrong with this glorious sandwich?\" I thought to myself.   So I was more than a little surprised to find the inside of my burger 100% completely room-temperature purplish slimy raw-tacular. Ew, ew, ew ew ew ew gross ew wtf gross.  Okay, I ordered medium rare. It is the best way to eat beef. But come on, people. Medium rare does not mean still mooing on the plate. Not cool, Bonbon. I thought we had something really special. HOW COULD YOU?  Additionally, $14 for a lunch cheeseburger is a bit steep, no?  ANYWAYS, I highly recommend, nay, I URGE you to go to Bonbon. Get something from their drink menu, get a cupcake or a fig bar. In these endeavors they have triumphed 100%. But for now, I can't wholeheartedly recommend eating a full meal there. Hopefully time will bring improvement in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Bubble and Squeak satifies the sweet yet savory craving people want for brunch. I personally love the brussel sprouts and carrots in this dish mixed with maple bacon pieces in some sweet glaze.    The breakfast nachos are also a great choice...especially if you are hungry...you will not leave hungry with that dish.  I recommend extra hot sauce and a side of sour cream.  As a coffee connoisseur, I enjoyed their brew.  Their biggest downfall is the service on a Saturday afternoon. Once seated, after an extensively long wait,  we weren't really sure who our server was since we kept having to ask anyone we could find to attend to us.   But I would go definately go back to try some other food items; just not on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"I love bon bon. Each time I've come I get the egg sausage breakfast sandwich, which is upscale, huge and delicious. I always get the chai to drink and a pastry to go. The lemon bars are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Bon Bon is adorable! I really enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the great service. I will definitely be back very soon to relax with my laptop and sip warm beverages! The food was thoughtful and interesting ..although the portions are small. The decor is delightful! I'm interested in trying more of the menu items.Our serve Nicki was excellent! The bespectacled lady behind the counter was also very charming.  So glad to have this wonderful place so close to my home. I plan to become a regular."}
{"text":"Disappointing macarons (stale texture and some kind of sugar glaze?), bland lemon square (wasn't sweet or tart), pedestrian eclair. Will not be stopping in again. Maybe it's a better cafe."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast/brunch. I had the \"egg or chicken\" breakfast and it was amazing. The desserts are delicious; I had the chocolate mousse. Super friendly staff and cool decor/ambiance."}
{"text":"Chorizo biscuits and gravy. Atomically good. Like, can't say enough good about it. Wife had basic breakfast special. Loved it (it was eggs, bacon and rosemary focaccia toast, simple but reportedly excellent.) We each also had a basic latte. Hands down, best breakfast in Cle so far (6 years and counting). The kicker; $17 for two. Freaking amazing! Seriously. Check out the b&g pic.  We'll make the 30min drive to come back."}
{"text":"I heart Bonbon.  I've been here about four to five times since Bonbon has opened, and there's just something about that place that makes me smile.  It's a cute cafe. Rustic, hipster, cozy, all wrapped together. You walk in and it's a sea of gray colors with heavy white plates and waiters and waitresses with hipster glasses. Cool. Very cool.  It's a cute date place. There's tables across the window- a rather small seating area, but it's a cafe, what would you expect? I think what I love the most about Bonbon is not only is it cozy and hipster-ish, the wait staff is incredibly knowledgeable. You ask them one question, and they launch into how the food is made and everything about the menu item you questioned them about... it's good. That's how it should be done.  Parking is pretty good too. I mean, there's street parking all over, and the location is good as it's right next to Crop (my other fave restaurant).   Now on to the food:  - The coffee: YESSSS! Good coffee! Oh, how I hate burnt coffee that most breakfast places serve you. Other breakfast places serve you some weak coffee that's been burnt, but you keep drinking it, hoping that it pays off somewhat. Not Bonbon! They give you FRENCH PRESS..now that's good stuff.  - The food is delish as well: - The Bubble & Squeak is good... slightly small, but the root vegetable is really good and so is the brussel sprouts.  - The chocolate french toast is to DIE for. Dark chocolate french toast with a creme brulee batter with orange marmalade? ooga booga, it's good.  - The cider bacon is really good in the breakfast special. Although, I must say, I do like Lucky's pecan encrusted bacon better, Bonbon still cooks it well.  -The slow roasted pork is heavy but really good as well.  - The cider is good as well as their lemon tart.  Overall, Bonbon is just plain and simply good. It's hipster-ish and unique, a refreshing air to me, as Bonbon is definitely my type of restaurant that I've been searching for, here in CLE."}
{"text":"Came back to this place a couple more times since the last review.   Once for brunch:  Had the bubble and squeak - was not as great as the other reviews made it sound. Brussels sprouts were way better at Lolita. The brussels sprouts here, I felt, were underdone and could have had more flavor. The bacon that came with it was tasty, but there was just so little bacon :( My friend had the tofu hash (replaced brussels sprouts with eggs for no extra fee), which tasted pretty well from the small bite I had. She really enjoyed her dish, and it looked a lot bigger than my dish. The rest of the brunch menu looked pretty tasty, so maybe, maybe I'll come back for brunch.   Have tried a couple more pastries. LOVE the fig bars. These are what keeps me coming back every single time I'm over at W 25th. So full of figs, like a gigantic gourmet fig newton bar. The fig chocolate cheese cupcake is also quite tasty, moist, nice after taste of cheese. The coconut cupcake, on the other hand, was very very dry. Other cupcakes/pastries I've had... turtle cupcake (decently moist, well made), coconut macaroon (tasty, nice white chocolate coat on the bottom), fig cupcake with goat cheese (didn't like this one, but may be because I don't like goat cheese... just got drawn in cause of the fig), macarons (nice crunch and soft).   The main thing that keeps Bonbon from getting higher than 3 stars is the service. Very very bad service here. The waiters/front desk just don't care. One time, I asked the front desk person if he could tape my box of pastries since the previous time, the box opened and spilt my cupcakes in my bag when I went shopping at Westside Market... he rolled his eyes and gave me an \"ugh, well maybe you shouldn't open your box.\" Brunch was also really really slow... waited forever just to get our food.   Will still keep coming back for the fig bars. Sad that service isn't as great as the pastries."}
{"text":"Great little space. Clean, open and airy atmosphere, although it is a bit small. Food was great. They even have non-standard brunch items like mini tacos. Serving sizes are they should be at a restaurant, so don't go expecting standard midwest portions (i.e. ginormous servings).   One thing that made me sad...no champagne for mimosas on a Sunday. Whaaaaat???? They sell beer on Sunday, but not mimosas. :( Sad.   Would still go back. I'd just stick to non-Sundays."}
{"text":"I was just daydreaming this morning about how, once upon a time (last summer), I had the most unbelievable Bonbon apple fritter EVER at Phoenix Coffee and found that today's hankering was too large to ignore. \"Yes. A gigantic apple fritter would really turn this day around,\" I thought to myself.   After calling my husband and explaining in disturbing detail this pastry that I ate almost a year ago, we decided to try this place out. Luckily, we were able to find a decent metered spot nearby, but I can see how parking might make frequent return visits somewhat prohibitive.   We absolutely loved our lunches. We had french pressed coffee (SO GOOD, but a little cold...), the tofu rocket salad (LOVE arugula!!) and the classic breakfast with eggs, foccaccia and bacon. I was disappointed that they didn't have the apple fritter that I was dreaming about, so we decided to instead share the silver dollar pancakes that had some of the same flavors... Everything was good, but those pancakes were simply incredible!!! I loved the sprinkle of cinnamon sugar! The apples were delicious with the pancakes!  All the servers were really friendly and efficient and quick to offer coffee refills.   I definitely think we will be coming a lot more often once the weather turns. The parking situation is not great, but once it isn't as cold, it will be easier to walk over from other parking areas."}
{"text":"Best place to get a breakfast! Even if you get the $6 breakfast special,  or pile of bubble and squeak, their food is delicious, reasonably priced and filling! The waitstaff is attentive and polite.  Always ready to refill your coffee. The pastries are amazing. Always a great selection.  LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I typically come early-ish on Saturdays and I love that they open before most of the other options in Ohio City.  I've had many things on the menu and nothing has disappointed.  My favorite is probably the Breakfast Nachos although their daily quiche and the omelettes are also solid go-tos.  Their hot tea collection is also impressive--there's plenty of options for the non-coffee drinker."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast yesterday. I really like the big, bright windows. It is always good to break the day in a bright and open restaurant eating good food. I had the breakfast special for $6. It includes two eggs, french pressed coffee, 2 strips of bacon and 2 triangles of focaccia bread. The serving sizes aren't huge but were filling enough. I don't really like to spend a lot of money on breakfast so I wouldn't try some of the stuff on the menu. I was glad to see that they offer outstanding beers. They had both Hop Slam and Breakfast Stout. I don't really like drinking too much in the morning time. The coffee was good enough. I will definitely return for more breakfast. Next time I will try some of their sweet stuff."}
{"text":"The key to a good eggs benedict is a perfectly poached egg with a perfect amount of good  Hollandaise sauce.  Their menu even advertises the dish as \"2 perfectly poached eggs.\"  That's the reason I ordered it - I wanted 2 perfectly poached eggs!  I got one.  The other one was not just a tad overdone, there was almost no runny yolk at all.  Sad, so so sad.  Remembering what the menu advertised: mad, so so mad.  Then for dessert, apparently Bonbon was a Food network Cupcake Wars winner!  So of course we tried their cupcakes.  Specifically the s'more cupcake.  Ugh.  Maybe they were up against some starter cupcake company or some chain bake shop or the judges were super biased...who knows.  But it was dry and had way too much cinnamon.  Disappointed :("}
{"text":"AMAZING food and bakery items. My husband and I went here for the first time last weekend. He got the chorizo nachos and i got the eggs benedict. Both very good. I wish they had more things without chorizo in them, its in like half the menu haha. Also, the home fries are really crispy and delicious. I also like that they have coffee set out if you have to wait for a table, which we didn't fortunately!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming is the word to describe Bon Bon.  I might add that it appears that some of the other reviews are making excuses for this place, too. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this is Cleveland - our food experiences should be out of this world. It's kind of our thing.  Some friends and I stopped in on a rainy Saturday for afternoon coffee. Something was just - off.  The shop was completely empty, the pastry case looked pathetic and sad, and the staff seemed put off that we were there.  The kicker is that the posted prices are half of what we were charged for coffee. The menu on the wall displays $1.50 and we were charged $3.00.  When we asked about this, we were told that 'the prices just went up.'  I honestly thought it was a joke.  Maybe it was an off day for them, but between the passive staff, lukewarm coffee, and improperly displayed prices, I think this was the first and last experience at Bon Bon for me."}
{"text":"I've been on a morning breakfast kick lately and since this place opens at 6:30am (kitchen at 7)  I was bound to get here at some point.  Bubble & Squeak remains my favourite entrée. The portion size is perfect and its a healthy plate. There are a couple of pieces of bacon, really delicious brussel sprouts, some type of root veg pancake and an all around good, not-to-thick sauce on top it.   Today unfortunately, while the flavours of my dish were all in tact, service was a bit off. The waiter was friendly and on top of the coffee, but the kitchen was...not awake yet. My food came out a little too cold for me being the only guest in the entire restaurant. In my opinion, at 25-30 minutes, it also took a bit too long to cook. Now I know it wasn't a simple fried egg and bacon, but still I'd say the wait was a bit long. And as a side note, the restaurant was freezing.   My friend also noted his chicken and the egg entrée was a bit different than when he had it last so perhaps this place could work on kitchen consistency some.   Just a note, the street parking rules are different on weekday mornings than they are on weekends so if you are only used to coming to this neighborhood on weekends, pay attention to the signs if you come early on a weekday. The parking police patrol."}
{"text":"Finally, I came to this place, I must have 3 \"ghost check-ins\" due to it being so crowded as I walk up to the window. I like the fact you have walk-in options, there is a door to your right, or a door-less entry to the left. Maybe some days people want to use doors and don't want to on other days, well BonBon was prepared for that and came thru for their clientele. It is a cool, chill place (speaking of chill,it was very cold, turn up! the heat!), it is on the corner and has huge windows excellent for people watching. It is in the perfect location for it also.  I ordered the Chicken or the Egg and was pleasantly surprised, the chicken was exceptional, cannot go wrong with an english muffin and I was feel in' egg that particular day. I will definitely stop here again to try out some more of the menu."}
{"text":"Our favorite place lately... We've been here 3 times this month!  My favorite atmosphere as far as CLE breakfast places go (#2 is probably Jack Flaps).   I recommend the French press coffee... Be sure to snag some vanilla bean sugar from their self-serve area.  I can't get away from the all-day breakfast special ($7): amazing, ultra cushy rosemary focaccia, \"real\" bacon and large, high quality eggs (lots of yolk, great flavor)... I'm probably going to geek out and ask them where they're from next visit.   My boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich with sausage today and I can't rave about it enough: I hate English muffins, but I'd eat these ones all day. The sausage tasted fresh and super flavorful (and as someone who makes my own sausage, I'm a pretty big snob about it). The egg was perfectly over easy, which gets major kudos from me.  I don't like croissants, but I DO like theirs. I'm not into donuts, but you MUST try their cinnamon sugar donuts (get them as a breakfast app)!  If there's a wait, it's totally worth it - be patient (the tables turn quickly).  Long story short, go here if you haven't! I can't imagine you being disappointed. Every single thing I've had there is awesome and expertly prepared!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both dishes I've tried had exceptional flavor! The portions are a little small for my taste, but I always leave feeling refreshed!  Minimalist decor, it's a great place for meetings and conversation. They were also very accommodating to my food allergies. Eating #soyfree #dairyfree, there were surprisingly lots of menu options. They cook with very fresh ingredients and use creative combinations of flavors!"}
{"text":"Such an unpleasant experience. The gentleman that seated us is the only reason I give it 2 stars. He was very nice and attentive, got us seated right away.  There is no other highlight to my breakfast for today. My fiancé and I ordered chorizo biscuits and the seasonal french toast. (This would be the last time we would ever see the waitress again.) When our food arrived, it looked pleasant, and we were ready to dig in. The chorizo biscuits tasted like someone put spicy mayo over it instead of gravy, and it may have had 4 or 5 pieces of chorizo in it. It was disgusting. Literally the worst biscuits and gravy I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. The French Toast was burnt. Like almost entirely black burnt. And no syrup so it was very dry. The goat chz whip and fig compote were the only thing keeping it somewhat edible, which were sparingly plopped on top.  Then after 20 minutes of staring at our half eaten plates, another girl finally comes up and asks if we were ready to cash out. ( What happened to the first waitress!? We may never know.) All in all we will not be coming back here, we usually go to Jack Flaps if we are on this side of town. And will continue to do that from now on."}
{"text":"It may not have been BonBon's top cupcakes, but I had some at a MetroMix party and was very disappointed.  I'm not a big cupcake person, but I typically do love the gourmet cupcakes that have recently gotten popular.  So, when I reached to grab a BonBon cupcake, I was disappointed when it tasted like something I could make.  I'm not sure what the flavor was, maybe red spice with a cream cheese frosting?  I had one bite, gave it to a friend, who also had one bite and put it down.   Now, it could be that she donated the cupcakes for the MetroMix party, in which case they were probably what I would expect."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you what the food tasted like but the host, who appeared to be the owner, was a jackass, so we left. Both my wife and I used to work in the restaurant business , so, no, we weren't being pretentious. We simply asked for a 7 top and he was rude about it and turned around and went about his business. So, we went to the Westside Market Cafe instead where we were greeted with smiles. Sorry, Bonbon, no new customers for you."}
{"text":"I have been in the restaurant industry for over 10 years, so it takes something very special to wow me.  Everything about my experience here was fantastic.  Just inside the entrance there is a display filled with the most tempting baked goods I've ever seen.  My boyfriend and I were greeted warmly, and seated at a table right by the window.  The restaurant is located just across the street from the Westside Market, which is perfect for people watching.  We both ordered what we both agreed was great cup of coffee.  For brunch I ordered the eggs benedict, and my boyfriend ordered a turducken sandwich.  I love eggs benedict, so I always order it.  Our brunch arrived promptly, and as we both took our first bite we gave each other a look as we chewed as if to say \"Oh my god!\" I am not exaggerating when I say the eggs benedict is one of the best things I have ever tasted.  The eggs were perfectly poached and runny, the English muffin incredible and made in-house, the Canadian bacon was cooked perfectly.  But the SAUCE, oh the sauce! This hollandaise sauce made me want to leave my boyfriend and marry the chef! Nobody ever does hollandaise sauce right, but Bonbon has raised my standards to a new level.  My boyfriends turducken sandwich was incredibly delicious as well as imaginative and fun.  The bread was made out of actual stuffing, and topped with a cranberry aioli that adds the perfect compliment to the fresh turkey, chicken and duck prosciutto. This is the longest Yelp review I have ever written, but I just couldn't end it without telling you to try some of Bonbon's pastries.  If you are ready to change your life, you should try the key lime or lemon tarts, we bought a box of assorted pastries upon leaving which sealed the deal.  Bonbon you are our new brunch spot, we love you."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is unique and always good. There is always s French Toast special that is interesting.  The service is friendly, but not hovering. The atmosphere is a draw for me - cute place, big windows that let in lots of light.  Always feels special to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Finally made it in for a late breakfast the other day. The space itself is adorbs. The service is amazing! And the food? Incredible!   The boy has a sweet tooth... so we started with the donut holes. They come with some really yummy dipping sauces.   He ordered the vanilla bean french toast.... which was amazing. The toast is so thick that even with me helping... we couldn't finish! I ordered \"The Chicken or the Egg\" which was a delicious combo of fried chicken and an over-medium egg (that's how I ordred it) with avocado and roasted tomato. YUM.   This is a definite winner in OC. Loving that such a yummy place is right down the street."}
{"text":"This place is more polarizing than the Kardashian family. Some people love it, some people hate it, and there's very few people who have been here who don't have a strong opinion about it. I'm firmly in the first camp.  When I first heard of this place, I thought, \"That'll be a great spot to take my wife on a breakfast date.\" Well, she beat me to it when she went there with some girlfriends, and she came back and said the food wasn't that good.   Fast forward a few months later...we needed a place to meet an out-of-town guest for lunch, and I suggested Bonbon. I think several months of campaigning to go there finally wore down my wife, who agreed to go. I had the Bacon, Bacon, and Eggs and I loved it despite the fact that I had clenched my teeth in my sleep the night before and chewing was painful.  A few weeks later, I got baptized and needed a place to celebrate. There were several in our party that hadn't yet been here, so we went here. I got the same exact thing and loved it. In my opinion, this is the best deal in town--you get plenty of food for under $10, and not only are the portions big, but the food is delicious too. Some of the other menu options are a bit more pricey though. The Breakfast Special around the same price as the Bacon, Bacon, and Eggs though and you get a beverage (you can even get a beer!) as part of it.   I still haven't had any cupcakes, which is amusing considering that the proprietor became famous on the TV show Cupcake Wars. They look great, but I'm usually full after my meal, and they're closed when my wife and I are looking to grab a little sweet something after dinner.  My only complaint is that the service is a bit slow, but I heard that they are getting a new chef, so perhaps things will be faster. Don't go here if you're in a rush!  All in all, Bonbon is my favorite place to go for breakfast in the Cleveland area. If I ever need to schedule breakfast or lunch dates in the future, I'm going to have them at Bonbon. I don't know why I like this place so much--plenty of other great restaurants in and around the Cleveland area have great breakfast food--but I do."}
{"text":"I've been to this place before but this time was not as good as the first as the food is still good however the entire restaurant is very dirty. This place could be really something if they just put a little more effort into cleaning."}
{"text":"I go to Bonbon a lot on Saturdays for comedy (seriously, where isn't there comedy in Cleveland right now?). The atmosphere is nice, the staff is very friendly, and their coffee is french pressed and delicious."}
{"text":"Had french toast and coffee. Amazing. The toast was out of this world, fluffy like cake and not overly sweet. It was perfectly made, covered in fluffy whipped cream, chocolate chips, and strawberries (fruit changes seasionally). The cafe mocha was very strong, but good. Everyone at my table was happy with their order, but envious of my french toast. The staff was helpful and kind, and it was a great brunch. My only suggestion: somewhat small cafe, any group larger than our party of 5 will have trouble getting a table."}
{"text":"I was looking for a breakfast spot while in the area.  I ran into this place because I saw people inside lol (I was looking for another restaurant).  I just decided, heck with it and go in. Ummm...the vibe wasn't all that great. I just wanted to hang out so I decided to eat outside.  My server was okay...I was torn between getting the special or trying the quiche.  I asked my server about the quiche and she said that it wasn't really her fave so I went with the special...eggs, bacon and focaccia bread, I also added a side of potatoes (mmmmm potatoes). Now one thing kind of had me giving side eye was her keep pushing water on me. I ordered a glass of orange juice and she asked me if I wanted water...I said no, then she asked me again \"are you sure you don't want any water?\" No, as I was already sipping on my o.j. and then she asks again...I just ended up saying, \"yes, I'll take some water\".  I just found it to be funny and had me feeling a certain way lol.  When I ordered eggs, it states any style...so I thought the correct \"saying\" for the way I wanted it was \"I would like them dry/hard\". The eggs were not dry/hard...it was a little runny...super soft scrambled eggs...in my book kind of gross.  The only thing that I really ate were the potatoes and the bacon. I just kind of picked through my food.  Food wasn't that great, server was a little standoffish, water pusher (lol-kidding), pretty set on this being a one time visit."}
{"text":"Eaten breakfast and brunch here quite a few times, and most of the time it's pretty good, although not the most consistent. it's also always really busy on weekends.   What I really come here for though is the chocolate croissants...they are AMAZING. Just do yourself a favor and get some to go next time you're here. The service has always been really friendly whenever I stop in as well."}
