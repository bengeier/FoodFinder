{"text":"This is a new breakfast and lunch place near the state capital. I had enchiladas with green sauce. The sauce was GREAT! Loved the whole meal. The service is fantastic. Very unique place, as it is tied to the vocational development program of Phoenix Rescue Mission. Great place for a great meal while supporting the program."}
{"text":"It's hard not to love this place!  First and foremost, I love the concept. Phoenix Rescue Mission is a great organization that provides quality services to a struggling community. They have created this place to help train their clients and prepare them for a new start. I would probably eat there regularly even if the quality of food and service was just average. I'm happy to say that it is considerably more than that!  We shared several things on the menu and everything was very good. The service was also fast and friendly making this a perfect place for a downtown lunch."}
{"text":"What a great place and concept. Just opened last month and the Mission Possible Cafe donates 100% of its proceeds to benefit the Phoenix Rescue Mission as well as provide \"on-the-job\" training and experience to Mission residents. That alone would be a great reason to support this place but then there is food and service. Oh my goodness! I had the Green Chili Pork Soup and Oaxaca Crisps. Both served up quickly, presented well and with a smile to boot. The soup was fantastic. A well balanced green chili and  pork with just the right amount of spice.  The crisps looked like a piece of art and were delicious too. I love this place and will be back! Great food for a great cause."}
{"text":"From the outside, it's nothing special. Once you walk in, there is plenty of open room and it is a great environment. They food is fairly priced (a daily $5 meal special) and all of it is delicious! If you are thinking of stopping by, just do it! Plus, it helps the local community as workers there are rebuilding resumes and proceeds benefit the Phoenix Rescue Mission."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. The food was great and the customer service was unbeatable. I had two tacos in lettuce wraps and they were very tasty. I also ordered the elote and it was a hit with the whole table. I would definitely go back!! I highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"What a great place!   Nicely decorated and the green chili pork soup was to die for.   My friend had a burrito and loved it.   The service was great as well, friendly and accommodating.   One can even call in and order to go.   They are open for breakfast and lunch and best of all, all proceeds go to Phoenix Rescue Mission, an awesome organization that provides housing and support to those trying to reset the lives and to those who may be living on the street.     Support this local restaurant!!!!!    You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very nice cafe! Went over to have lunch and I had a burrito with a side of guac and chips! Wow, that was a lot of food, I barely eaten half. It was very good and they have a house hot sauce that was pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"First time here, what a hidden gem! Fantastic lunch and breakfast specials daily - and the best part...100% of the proceeds go to benefit the Phoenix Rescue Mission! Support a great cause...and enjoy a delicious meal in the process. Two thumbs waaaay up!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food, good prices, attentive staff. Clean and quiet--great for meetings. A well-kept secret!"}
{"text":"Amazing chilaquiles, it was very filling and flavorful. They have a lot of menu items to choose from and really great service. This is an amazing cafe that is really helping our community, great way to support them by eating here. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I was really rooting for this place when I walked in. The atmosphere was welcoming and the staff was friendly. Not to mention all of the proceeds go to a great cause. The ratings that were displayed on yelp were enough to get me in the door. But I was left a little disappointed in the food itself. The Mexican Cobb was great and everything tasted very fresh on it. However, I also ordered the huevos rancheros. There was far too much salsa which tasted like tomato paste and the tostada was hard to bite through rather than being crunchy and it couldn't be saved by the well cooked egg. I may go back to try the cookies that everyone is raving about but not to sit down and have a meal. I support the cause I just think if you're a Mexican restaurant, the salsa should at least be good."}
{"text":"Totally loved this place. Great atmosphere and a great cause. Everything benefits the Phoenix Rescue Mission.

My favorite items were the elote and churro donut. They take the corn off the cob, so it's like a creamy elote dip which goes so well with the chips. It was hard not to make a whole meal of that before my burrito came out. 

The churro donut was no doubt the best donut I've ever had. It was still warm and perfectly crisp. It melted in my mouth. I need another one now just thinking about it...

Friday was $5 burrito day, and it came with a drink and chips. As if the prices weren't already great. The chicken burrito was tasty. I think I missed out not getting either the pork or carne asada- they both looked amazing. 

After the meal you even get a mini chocolate cookie. We buy the boxes of cookies as gifts. They come in nice gift box packaging and you can even order gluten free ones ahead of time."}
{"text":"It's not often that I find the Hidden Gem but here it is !  Delicious coffee, excellent breakfast burrito stuffed full of egg, and their Mexican food is to die for. The red sauce has that nice dark flavor without being burned, they have several Salsas to choose from, all are delicious, and the chips and guacamole are so satisfying I almost didn't need a meal. I hesitate to post such an excellent review because they will get so busy, but it's way worth it. It's for charity after all!"}
{"text":"I visited Mission Possible Caf√© the week of 9/25. It was a brief drive from where I work downtown and had ample parking, which is rare in the downtown Phoenix area. The staff was warm and inviting. The menu boasted a healthy variety of Mexican-inspired plates like tacos, burritos, and nachos. My pulled pork burrito was flavorful and well prepared. This spot has a great mission and heart for the surrounding community."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple of weeks ago with a small group. We each ordered something different, and pronounced it all delicious. Don't pass on the cookies, either. 

Returned for breakfast this morning-had the daily special, breakfast burrito and coffee. Huge burrito, not a store bought tortilla. Yummy salsas at the salsa bar. Best breakfast in the area, bar none."}
{"text":"We loved our first experience at the Mission Possible Cafe and we will definitely be back soon! I got the steak tacos and my fiance got the chicken burro. We LOVED our food. It was delicious to the last bite. We received excellent customer service, the staff is so friendly. Amazing selection of food, coffee, great location and plenty of parking - what's not to love?! Oh and you have to try the super soft cookies (my favorite was snicker doodle). Most importantly, we loved supporting such a great cause."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Large modern Mexican cafe. Was formerly the Oaxaca restaurant but now a social enterprise. Has a about 20 tables. Colorful and Vibrant atmosphere gives this place a feel good vibe.

Food: Lots of unique Mexican dishes to choose, from especially from the small dish category, which I think is what makes this place shine. I went with Elote and the Oaxacan \"crisps\" essentially tostadas. Both were excellent. More than generous serving sizes. The soups and breakfast look good as well.

Price: Good value and your dollars go to a worthy cause.

Service: Everyone I came in contact had a smile and made you feel welcome.

Overall: A GREAT place to try out in central Phoenix that goes to a good cause. Try the small plates!"}
{"text":"This was a lovely place to grab lunch since I never got around to meal-prepping this week. The layout is very open, plenty of seating. My food was brought to me in a hurry.

I got the green chili pork soup and two tacos. The soup was excellent, the right amount of chili taste and the pork was perfectly cooked. It came with a nice large tortilla that was a great break from the savoriness of the soup. 

The tacos were slightly disappointing. The tortillas and refried beans were clearly older and the pork was cold. The taste was good, as was the salsa that accompanied, but nothing I would order again.

I will probably return since it's for a good cause."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a coworker. It's a nice little place, clean and open. Though we walked over, there seemed to be quite a large number of parking spaces for this establishment. The woman working at the register was super nice and accommodating, making sure to repeat and confirm any special changes to our meals. 

I ordered the chicken burrito bowl, which was served very quickly, and came with a side of tortilla chips and a cookie. The tortilla chips seemed a bit stale, but overall, the components of my bowl were fresh, in a good ratio, and delicious. Nothing to write home about, but definitely good enough to come back again.

Great place, great service, great cause. Would recommend."}
{"text":"All proceeds support the Phoenix Rescue Mission. So don't expect to see Tom Cruise or anything like that. They also offer catering services, but no tense background music playing in the background suggesting that only seconds remain. My team included four co-workers, educators if you will, except for me, I write grants and run-on setences. The restaurant had a cafeteria feel, although the decor has more of a restaurantish feel with a southwest mission style theme (i.e., the mission buildings, although pun intended, again) and there were profesional, blown-up pictures of children and some adults served by the Phoenix Rescue Mission on the walls. Don't miss the salsa bar with spicy, ripe jalepenos, diced onions, cilantro, and both spicy and mild salsa at the counter where orders are placed. The price is on the inexpensive end of the spectrum with the portions being on the filling side. The elote was muy bueno, and breakfast is served all day until they close mid-afternoon. I'd say it is more of a diamond in the rough than a hidden gem."}
{"text":"We are just visiting and found this cafe via Yelp. It was such a nice surprise. They had a breakfast special of a breakfast burrito and drink for 5 dollars. My wife and daughter would have shared one if they'd realized how big they were! The salsas on the salad bar were fantastic. The breakfast burritos were perfect, hot and big, with the ingredients spread out well so you get a little bit of everything in each bite. The egg was fully cooked but not rubbery, and the bacon was crisp but not burnt. The restaurant was clean and tasteful, and the staff was friendly. All that on top of the good it does in the community... Bravo!"}
{"text":"Help a person, get a lunch, how cool is that? Check out the $5 lunch because it's the best deal going in DT Phoenix. I had the Friday special consisting of a burro and drink. Satisfying and you help the community because all proceeds benefit the Phoenix Rescue Mission."}
{"text":"There manager Gabriel is probably the coolest guy I met! If I were a female I would I just wish I was eating him and not the food !"}
