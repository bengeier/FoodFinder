{"text":"I was excited to go there after reading promising Yelp reviews.   After my one and only visit I have mixed feelings about the place. The sandwich with bacon, onions etc. was tasty but definitely overpriced. A small piece of relatively dry bread is not worth the money in my opinion. Plus I had to wait for my sandwich for a long time, around 20 mins (!!). And they weren't even that busy then. I had to ask about it a few times and the whole situation felt quite awkward. At some point you don't want to give up when you have waited long enough. By the time I finally got it I had read the idle newspaper thoroughly (which is kind of a good thing). Haven't gone twice."}
{"text":"My new neighbourhood coffee house. 4.5 stars out of 5.  I love that they offer fresh, organic/local products, half-sized sandwiches, and almond milk as an option for lattes. Vegan options available. I also love the corner booth. Furthermore, all leftover sandwiches are donated to Second Harvest. Bonus points in my book.   Sliced Gourmet is a great, contemporary addition to the area. So glad you're here!"}
{"text":"Ducked into this place to escape the rain, hoping something on offer would improve my day. I get back to the office and bite into the muffin I bought. Without sounding hyperbolic (its a muffin after all) this is the worst muffin, nay, pastry I've ever tasted. I couldn't taste the muffin, for there was no muffin to taste.   What I could could taste was cinnamon and flour. That was it. Flour and cinnamon are ingredients and should never be the centerpiece of anything. 4$ for a mealy, dry, muffin-shaped mound of cinnamon and flour held together by lies and wax paper. For the record, it was a carrot muffin. Carrots were harmed in the making of this muffin.  I want my money back, and my tongue would like an official apology. You know, not to sound hyperbolic. Seriously though, I'm pissed. I have 87$ in my bank account and those 4$ were meant to buy a shred of hope for an otherwise miserable day. You owe me hope, \"Sliced\". Hope, and 4$."}
{"text":"Little slice of heaven this place is. My cab driver even commented on how good my coffee smelled. Great service too. So happy to stumble upon it!"}
{"text":"Have been back several times on the weekends and looked forward to their delicious breakfast sandwiches, with their crunchy, egg-ey and bacon-ey goodness. Only to be told that they were no longer being offered on the weekends! While I agree with fellow Yelpers about the quality and freshness of the ingredients, still, $9 for a cold ham and cheese sandwich is a bit much. Will have to make the drive to Le Gourmand when the craving strikes from now on!"}
{"text":"Tasty baked goods and a lot of great options that are gluten free. Sandwiches are also nice,  but a bit too pricey which doesn't feel worth it. The ginger maple tea is great,  I loved that they threw in whole chunks of ginger."}
{"text":"At first I thought this place was pretentious as hell, overpriced and doomed to fail. But I soon realized I was severely mistaken. The fine patrons of Sliced are the friendliest bunch I have met and they genuinely take the extra step to ensure their customer's satisfaction.  Sandwiches, pizzas, pastries are made fresh daily from sustainable and local produce, and what isn't sold is donated to Second Harvest. Perhaps this doesn't mean much to some, but it embodies their approach to food and care for others.   I've had their Lobster BLT and while it was a hefty $13, it was succulent, crispy, moist and savoury in all the right places. Their Roast sandwich ($11) was described to me as a Sunday dinner stuck between two pieces of bread and right they were. Piles of tender beef, carmalized onions, gruyere and avacados dipped in rich gravy.   If you're in the neighbourhood and are craving something other than your typical fastfood steadfasts, there is no place better."}
{"text":"Here with my cool real estate agent Suzy!  Nice new spot downtown. Super convenient. Good selection. Nice folks behind the counter."}
{"text":"I don't usually write bad reviews, or any reviews at all lately.  But from my experience this place really needs to think about their customers.    I was excited for a new sandwich place when they first opened up.  I went in and thought, wow this is super expensive for the small size of the sandwich, so it must be REALLY tasty.  I left with my sandwich and found the hardest avocado I've ever had in my mouth... in my mouth.  I threw the avocado out and ate mostly bread. That was quite a while ago.  I just went back in to give them a second chance.  The girl behind the counter was friendly enough, but informed me that the soup is self serve. Fair enough.  I go over to the counter and there's no soup containers, so I ask another staff member, who is apparently annoyed with my silly question and tells me that I need to get it from the girl at the front.    The girl at the front is now attending to other customers, so I wait while they talk about what sandwiches they want, etc.  Now it looks to me like the woman has paid and is waiting for her change, or her sandwiches, and I'm wondering what all the clicking is about behind the counter.  Is she doing some complex HST math?  No, she's texting while I'm waiting to go serve myself some soup into a bowl that a lady who can't smile was unwilling to hand over to me (a potential paying customer) for her overpriced underwhelming food.  I don't recommend this place at all. Go somewhere that cares about their customers and gives you more than 4 tiny pieces of dry looking sliced chicken on a $11 pre-made salad."}
{"text":"Beautiful new cafe. One reviewer says this place is Toronto's answer to Pret a Manager, and I would have to agree!  I had a freshly made roast beef sandwich with mushrooms and fried onions, a latte, and a small slice of pizza. All of them were extremely well done. Definitely the best coffee in that area of the city.   The only negatives were the price, and the fact that there was only enough outside seating for 4. Together with my order and my girlfriend's (a double espresso, and tasty ham & cheese sandwich) the bill was $40. It's not the kind of place I could afford to eat lunch every day, but it was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Popped in to Sliced today for lunch with a friend, and was impressed. From the outside, Sliced looks unassuming. I live a 10 minute walk away, and have never noticed it there. The inside, however, tells another story. The decor is modern with rustic touches; it's comfortable to be in, and the staff is pretty friendly. The process is simple: boxed salads and cold sandwiches (along with an assortment of fresh juices and bottled waters) are available in the cool cases along the back wall; soups are self-serve from the wooden \"bar\" in the center, the warm sandwiches of the day and a selection of baked goodies can be ordered from the bar in front.   The food is definitely a step up from the area's other options. On this visit, I had a spinach salad with apples, mild blue cheese, candied pecans, and raspberry vinaigrette -- everything was fresh and delicious. I also had the soup of the day, a corn chowder that was delicious despite being non-dairy, and had a nice hint of smoky spice (curry? cumin?). On my way out, I grabbed an iced latte, which was made perfectly.   Sliced uses local, organic ingredients when possible, which results in your lunch being a little more pricey than your typical weekday lunch joint. It's worth it, though. If that's not enough to assuage your liberal guilt, Sliced donates any leftovers at the end of the day to a local food charity. They definitely walk the talk over at Sliced, which makes my tree-hugging heart smile.   I'm definitely heading back to Sliced. Tomorrow, in fact. I can't wait to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place has a Nadege style elegance...but slightly more casual. Great lattes. Love the long wooden table and stools by the window. There is only a couple tables for seating. I came here around 2pm and there were a couple people lingering. They offer cookies, squares and other treats. Looked amazing but just went for the latte today. I've heard the sandwiches are amazing, will have to return and try one"}
{"text":"I'm a hesitant fan. $7.95 seemed like a good deal for a quality sounding sandwich. Then I was hit with the tax. 17%, Canada? I suppose Sliced shouldn't be knocked for exorbitant tax.  Well, the sandwich was really great with its thick bacon, cheesy goodness, and buttery thick toast. It was a perfect way to begin my day before a 4+ hour bus ride. That's another thing about Sliced - they're conveniently located near the 610 Bay Street Bus Station. Also, the sandwich was served in less than 5 minutes and they had samples on the counter. Overall, a good place to start the morning with tasty sandwiches."}
{"text":"Having worked near the Yonge/College area for years, I've always complained about a lack of decent lunch options for those times where I've forgotten to bring something in, yet still want to eat something delicious.  After moving out of the area for a while and recently returning, I was surprised to find Sliced on Yelp -- a sandwich shop that prides itself on providing food options that're preservative-, additive- and hormone-free.  I didn't QUITE understand how the menu worked at first (better signage could help here), but I soon realized that they have a rotating menu of hot sandwich options and what seemed to be a more fixed list of cold ones available for take-away. You're not going to find much space to dine in (a counter with some stools), but if you're an espresso drinker or like finer desserts (like macarons, for example), it's worth sticking around to enjoy the food and the relaxed atmosphere.  Can't say that my wallet could take visiting constantly to this hipster's haven, but when I need something delicious to nosh on that's not going to punish my stomach later, I know where to come. (I had the shrimp and avocado -- DELISH.)"}
{"text":"3.5/5  Sliced is a bright ray of sun, in an area with some pretty poor lunch options.  Sliced offers high quality food, with a great variety. There are many organic, vegetarian, and gluten free options available.  The menu generally offers: soups, hot and cold sandwiches (freshly made and pre-made), pastries/sweets, salads, and usually something else on their hot plate.  I've sampled a little bit of everything. I am a big fan of their soups, hot sandwiches (delicious bread, gooey melty cheese, yum yum!), and hot plate items (FANTASTIC Empanadas). I'm not so much a fan of the cold sandwiches that have been pre-made earlier in the day. I also find some of their sweets a bit too sweet (although delicious. I devoured half a pecan tart but felt a bit sick afterwards due to the sweetness)  Note that Sliced is a bit pricy - a full sandwich can run you close to $10. I have a love affair with their leek & prosciutto empanada, but they are fairly small  (about the size of a pizza pop) and run just over $4. If you don't mind spending the extra cash, it's a great lunch option in the area!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating at Sliced! I love that they have a nice variety of sandwiches that are very different from your typical sandwich spot. My favorite, is the caprese, toasted with balsamic! You really just have to try it for yourself to fully understand. Also, they started doing tapas style stuff at night, which includes my favorite, the bacon wrapped date!"}
{"text":"VIBE  This is supposed to be Toronto's answer to Pret A Manger and I think it's in the perfect location of drab options (minus The Queen and Beaver) and crappy food trucks near Nathan Phillips Square, especially if you want something to grab and go.   That said, if you're looking for a casual first date or you're looking to upgrade your coffee date status from Starbucks (all you online daters...and PS never take a first date to Starbucks. It's not 1994 anymore), their hidden corner booth is the PERFECT nook. Just make sure you're really attracted to your date! That said, that nook holds about four to people comfortably so this is also perfect for a catch up with the girlfriends.   I love the marble counters. It's sleek and sophisticated.   WE ATE  Since I was here for a media preview, I did get the goods for free and got to sample many things on the menu.    What I remembered:  -The Parisienne: swiss cheese melted all over a ham & swiss sandwich. It was fresh and hot. Mmmm.  -Their roast beef was also delectable.  -Mediterranean Salad - with tomato, red onion, green peppers ,cucumber, kalamata olives, feta and greek vinaigrette. These are all of my favourite things!   I'm a big fan of their brownie. And I think they make it gluten free too! Mmmm.   There's also a variety of sodas, waters and prepped foods in their fridge as well.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  If I worked in the area, I would be here often. It's a contemporary addition to an area with blah lunch options. The perfect component to my \"Yummy Yummy Sandwiches\" list."}
{"text":"MMmmm, I love walking into a restaurant I've never been to and leaving feeling That I can't wait to come back again! This place serves hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, salads and soups. They also have some desserts in the glass counter. Sure, it sounds like a bunch of other sandwich places littering the downtown core, but their sandwich just blew me away.   I ordered their veggie sandwich which had a thin layer of marinated hard tofu, roasted red pepper, grilled zucchini and sauteed onions. Definitely no skimping on toppings here!! I actually had a hard time taking bites without something falling out. To top it off, the bread was grilled super well. I thought about this sandwich for the rest of the day. This makes it 4 stars for me!"}
