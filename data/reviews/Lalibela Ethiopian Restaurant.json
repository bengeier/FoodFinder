{"text":"Yum!  Very happy with the staff and the food.  It's not Canadian food so be prepared for something different.  If you like Ethiopian it is currently my fave but I sure have heard good things about Nazareth too.... Oh so many choices so little time!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food. 
The atmosphere was cozy. And service was very quick. 
This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and I have to say it won't be my last."}
{"text":"The place looks nice and cozy, but the food is average, i would stick to the cha cha tibs...."}
{"text":"It was our first time out for Ethopian food. We were happy to see local Ethopian patrons, suggesting some authenticity. Given that both of us had late lunches, we decided to share a lalibela platter. This was offered by the waitress as the dish to try for first timers. 

It wasn't long before our meal arrived. Before us, was a large platter of veggie and meat curries. We dived in with our fingers. Injera was cold, but good with the curries. I must admit, the curries lacked any significant flavour, which was a bit disappointing. Somehow we managed to finish our order. 

The service was minimalistic. We found ourselves having to flag down our waitress for our bill.

Definitely enjoyed trying out a new cuisine, looking forward to check out other places in the city."}
{"text":"There are apparently a hundred Ethiopian restaurants along this stretch of Danforth, by which I suppose I mean seven. We chose Lalibela for lunch on the basis of the reviews here, and also the fact that it was open.

My wife (not a big eater, but hungry from being dumb and missing breakfast) and I (big eater and pretty hungry myself) split the Lalibela platter, at the recommendation of the pleasant waitress. It was plenty of food for the two of us; there was a bit left over even, which we didn't take with us because we are bad, wasteful people.

I'm not an expert on Ethiopian food, though I quite like it, and couldn't tell you what the various dishes were. They were all pretty tasty, especially..the brown ones and the cabbage? How embarrassing.

One moderate imperfection: while the salads appear to be side dishes of respectable size, mine came as a sprinkling of lettuce and tomato in the middle of the platter. Not what I expected for $5, I must say.

Would recommend and hope we can return before we move away in 2 months."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm surprised to see it got some low ratings. It's not fancy, but the food is delicious. One of my regular go-to restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"so dont go here especially if your going to use credit card they will double charge you and refuse to give your money back even though they acknowledge they used your info and double charm ed you two days after your visit do not go here !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a Sunday evening: one veggie combo platter and lamb tibs. The food showed up quickly, but once we took it inside we realized that we had only received the combo, and not the tibs - the receipt stapled to the bag showed both, so we phoned back and explained what happened. They assured us that they would send the missing food out right away. We waited a bit, but started to eat after half an hour because we were starving. 60 minutes after the deliver we still hadn't received the missing food so we phoned back, this time they promised it was with the driver and would arrive within 10 minutes. After another half an hour, we gave up and cancelled the order. Very frustrating - needless to say we won't give them a second chance."}
{"text":"So happy to have been motivated by a Groupon to try this place! 

We've been Nazareth fans, but the more we go there, the more we get tired of the terrible service. We used to think the great food made it worth it, but after more than a dozen visits that clocked in at more than 3 hours - we were ready for a new go-to Ethiopian resto.

We grabbed the Groupon and headed down to Lalibela - and we were NOT disappointed! This place was great! The server was there immediately to get our drink order, and was very friendly. Our drinks came out within a minute, and we ordered our vegetarian platter for 2. I was especially happy that you can specify what level of spice you want, as I like it hot! Once the order was given, we hunkered in for what we assumed would be an inevitable wait.

SURPRISE! Our food came out within 10 minutes! 

They were extremely generous with the injera, and the various vegetable mixtures were much more numerous than other places we've been. The only let down is that there was one particular lentil mixture that was AMAZING and there was only one portion on the plate, rather than the 2 of all the other veggies. It was a large platter that we had trouble finishing, but - dang, did we give it our best shot!

The server checked in on us frequently, and when we were finished our cheque was promptly brought out. Both the bartender and the server said goodbye as we left.

My one criticism is that I wish the food that came out was just a bit warmer. It wasn't cold, but it wasn't hot either. I don't mind that they must make larger batches of the various dishes in order to have service be more efficient, but I would have liked things a bit warmer when it is served. Hopefully that was just a one-off mishap.

Overall we were SO HAPPY, we both agreed that we were now officially Lalibela regulars!"}
{"text":"I only came here because it's Tuesday and Nazareth is closed. It started out promising with an $11 price tag on the vegetarian platter but when we got the bill, the server charged us $11 each for the smallest portions imaginable. Also, (even ignoring the country's prestige in the matter) the coffee was the worst I've ever had. 

I had to award one star, but thats not the reality. No stars. I hate my life now."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the post-prandial cramping I experienced or maybe it was my dinner companion's unpleasant foray into the world of Ethiopian beer (a path which we will surely never traverse again), but I'm not rushing back to Lalibela Ethiopian Restaurant. 

I generally love Ethiopian cuisine- the textures, the spices, the niter kebbeh... heaven in every mouthful. Lalibela did it well for the most part - we ordered a combination platter of vegetables and meats, but the dishes were served cold (IMO meat should never be cold) and the sauce-covered drumsticks on the plate were just odd. Matter of opinion I suppose. Gold star for their injera but I couldn't move for days! 

Now, on to the cool. The restaurant is named after Lalibela, a town in Northern Ethiopia. The inside jacket of their menu features helpful historical information and tidbits on Ethiopian food and customs that enhances the diner's experience. Who ever knew about gursha, the Ethiopian tradition of feeding mouthfuls to the one you like. I just had to try it!

Staff were friendly enough, but disappeared towards the end of our meal, rendering us late for drinks. 

Overall I give it 2 stars - a relatively harsh rating for someone who doles out fours and fives like candy."}
{"text":"I had been twice before to this restaurant and thought it was pretty decent until recently when i went there for lunch. On ordering the veggie platter (same dish eaten before), the server came out with the food in 5 min, the food wasnt hot, temperature of food being room temperature to cold, making me presume that the food wasnt fresh and just reheated in microwave. Keeping that point aside, the red lentil was soooooooooo salty and the other two lentils were just bland, no flavour whatsoever.considering that ethiopian food has flavourful spiced foods. On enquiring whether the chef or the management had changed, i was informed that it wasnt the case. It just baffled me how the food could be so horrible in a span of 4 mths. Very disappointing considering i love ethiopian food. Server seemed to disappear as the restaurant wasnt that busy. 
Poor rating for food and service. I recommend that you find some other place. I for sure am never going back there."}
{"text":"The real ethiopian food! Tasty, tasty, tasty! and the price is really decent. I've been to so many ethiopian restaurant (including the ones in Ethiopia) but Lalibela sure knows how to bring you there while still in Toronto :). I like this location especially due to the set up of the room. 

I will go again anytime, this is definitely worth the 5stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went into the restaurant hungry and excited to try the food. We were obviously new to Ethiopian food and thus unfamiliar with the items on the menu. The waitress kept rushing us into ordering, and offered no suggestions until we had asked her. We ordered a chicken dish in spiced butter (waitress' recommendation) and a beef dish that came in a cast iron pan. We had also ordered tea and coffee. My boyfriend and I waited for almost an hour for the food to come. My ginger tea was forgotten, but we gave the waitress the benefit of the doubt that the fresh ginger would take awhile to boil. The food came before my tea, and when I asked her about it, it was obvious that she had forgotten about it. The food was cold and very bland. The chicken dish was sour, flavourless and cold. It was definitely not buttery and full of spices, as the menu stated. The beef dish was overcooked and cold, despite the cast iron dish that it came in. My boyfriend and I had had Ethiopian food once before (Ethiopiques) and it was not as bland as the food from Lalibela.

My boyfriend had asked for his coffee to come after his meal. When we asked our waitress to pack up our food, and we also reminded her about the coffee. After waiting for a good 20 minutes, we both knew that she had forgotten about us again. While sitting around, we noticed that a bigger group of familiar customers were being served. The waitresses refilled their water (our water was NEVER refilled! And our PAID drinks were NEVER brought to us!!). My boyfriend and I got sick of waiting around for the coffee, so we went up to pay for our bill. It turns out, our waitress never even took down the coffee order. 

To recap, the food is bland and flavourless, and the service is nonexistent. Sometimes I'd let some service slip-ups slide if the food were decent. However, the food at Lalibela did not even make up for their lack of service. Please do yourself a favour and avoid this awful place."}
{"text":"Came here on a thursday night to take advantage or a Groupon the husby purchased. It was a 20 mins wait till we got seated. Needless to say it is a very busy restaurant - the busiest on the street infact.
The servers were friendly and welcoming. I felt they went out of their way to make us comfortable, which is always nice! We ordered the Zil Zil Tibs and the Lalibela Special for one. Huge portions, we could not finish it all. Some of the yummy servings were a bit salty for my tasting, but overall it was good. This is however, not the best ethiopian food I have had, if I had to compare."}
{"text":"So fucking good.  Went to the east end location for the first time today.  I Ordered  #45 - tibs with veggie combo - lamb stew served with a variety of vegetarian stews, $17.

Holy fuck.  Tons of food.  Probably 3 meals for me.  Al the food is served in their injera bread, plus there is an extra bread (huge) to dip.  There is an amazing amount of lamb stew in here, plus 4-5 types of veggie stews, peas, lentals, colard greens, etc.  Like I said, I will be enjoying this for many more meals.  With tip, maybe came to $20 (IDK, tipped 15%).  Very good value, and delicious food.  Will be going back"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim.

The restaurant itself isn't much to look at and the booth backrests wobble anytime you or the person behind you leans back. But our server was the sweetest and the smells that surrounded me just by walking in had already gotten me salivating.

They had a page in their menu dedicated to their \"Vegetarian Menu\" options. The last plate sounded particularly enticing with a deliciously described concoction and tender beef strips... wait. what? I was confused and asked the waitress if it was the vegetarian menu, she confirm that it indeed was, so I then asked if it was mock meat for the \"beef\"... she said no, no that's beef. There was a moment of silence... sooo this isn't the vegetarian menu? oh no,  it is... just not that one. 
Ok, good to know.

They also were out of the first 2 beers we asked for so we settled for Beck's. We ordered our food; he got something lamb and I got something lentil... and there was tonnes of droolworthy injera.

The servings are ginormous and I could barely finish half. It was incredibly delicious... my dinner date was making all kinds of appreciative omnom noises over his lamb too.

At one point during our meal a server came around with a long handled pot of smoking roasted coffee beans for all the patrons to smell. It smelled like caffeine heaven.

Regardless of the decor, vegetarian meals with beef, busted furniture and lack of beer available... I would go back. The cost was a deal, the place was smellgasmic and the food flashbacks are making my mouth water as I type.

I do however want to compare it to other Ethiopian restos a tad closer to my digs however... see if it is up to par."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently great and makes me wonder if I couldn't be vegetarian if I had this type of food every day! Don't get me wrong - the meat dishes are great too. The kitfo dish made with raw beef is one of my favourites... The injera is always tasty and they give you plenty to work with. The best is the part under the portions that absorbs the flavour of the sauces, of course. The price of dinner is extremely low, especially if there are a group of people eating together. 

They often have beers imported from Ethiopia, but the only thing holding them back from a 5 star review in my book is that they have been out of those beers the last three times I have been there."}
{"text":"The ambience is unique especially for those who have never had an Ehiopean dining  experience. The menu is great for the health conscious and those on regimented diets such as I am. The Lalibella plate is the signature meal. The fish annd chicken are very nicley prepared and portioned. You are not gong to eat greasy cooked fare here. The severs are very accommodating  at lunch and dinner. Our party of four enjoyed the food but for the salad.One of party [a vegan] would have liked more traditional fare in that regard. Other than that it was very enoyable experience. Very good pricing. A nice break from the usual Greek food on the Danforth. A couple of us  had dined here a few times previously. The concensus was this is a definite return for lunch or dinner. Friendly and healthy."}
{"text":"Meat Platter is better than other ethiopian restaurants. I've been to wazema, rendez-vous, ethiopiques and Lalibela's meat platter is the best. The kitfo was super spicy the way I like it. Even the injera was the freshest and tastiest!"}
{"text":"After being bugged by friends and my wife to try Ethiopian food I gave in and agreed to go to Nazareth on Bloor. We went on a Tuesday unknowing that Nazareth was closed. My one friend suggested we go to Lalibela as he had been there before. 

We ordered two ginger tea, 1 Ethiopian special tea, a sprite (me haha), 2 orders of the vegetarian platters (each platter had enough food for 2-3 people), dero wat (sort of a stew with one chicken leg and one whole cooked egg) and a coffee ceremony at the end. 

The ginger teas came with fresh ginger chopped up in the water along with a tea bag. The Ethiopian special tea was a fragrant, spicy tea. Both were enjoyed. The vegetarian platter comes with about 6 different types of cooked, curried, stewed, etc vegetables (you get double the serving for two people) served on top of injera bread (something like a thick crepe). You get additional injera on the side to break a piece off  and scoop up your food. All the different vegetable items were very good; I really enjoyed them all. Lots of nice flavour for each. The extra injera we received was more than enough to eat up all our food. The dero wat was harder to eat because it was saucy and the chicken leg and egg you have to eat with your hands. I was expecting the stew to have chunks of chicken and maybe vegetables in it but that was incorrect assumption. It was an okay dish, not as flavourful as the vegetable platter. I'd try something popular like tibs instead next time. 

The coffee ceremony was the highlight for me. The coffee beans are freshly roasted in the kitchen and during the process, the waitress brought the steaming hot pan with smoking beans out to the table for us to smell and see. They are then brought back into the kitchen where they are ground up and brewed in a clay carafe. The coffee carafe is brought out with a wood craft tray with burning incense, small cups and popcorn. The coffee was mellow with lots of intricate flavour without being bold or bitter. The incense was earthy and smelled wonderful. The presentation and experience was excellent. 

Service was very friendly, helpful, accurate and prompt. Our waitress had nothing but a smile on her face. Other reviews sometimes complain of the service, we didnt have any problems and thought the service was very good. We did have to ask for our cheque but that didnt bother us because it was nice not to be rushed out the door when we were done. we sat and watched a little bit of the Ethiopian tv that was displayed. 

This was my first experience with Ethiopian food. My taste is pretty unadventurous generic white Canadian and I didnt feel intimidated by the food nor was it unapproachable in flavour. I very much enjoyed the food and the experience. I would return to Lalibela. I think you get excellent value and lots of food for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Wasn't very impressed at all and won't come back. We usually
Go to Nazareth but because of their poor service and long wait times even for take out we decided to go here. 
We were not impressed. Everything was mediocre. 
Picked up the veggie platter (for one) and lalibela platter (for one). The website says the lalibela platter was $14 turned out to be $16 ( for one person) so I would advise them to change their prices on the website for what you get it wasn't a lot.

Most of the food was either bland or very spicy. 

Comparing this place to Nazareth, it dosent even come close considering Nazareth is a) cheaper b) biggggg portions and c) better tasting food. 
 
Don't waste your time and money here"}
{"text":"I will always remember Lalibela, as my first ever visit to Ethiopian Restaurant  and the place that introduced me injera with all the goodies you can put on top of it. So good! I mean, I do not even have to write anything. Just check the photos. 

We had a booking for our dinner date, as the place was tiny and packed. Atmosphere is really lovely and warm and service is fast and attentive. We  got a nice little table and there was not much time to make a decision - injera platter, please. We shared one and it was plenty for us, and we could even take some home. If you never have had injera before, this is your excellent chance at Lalibela. I loved the tiny portions of different veggies and lentils placed on the bread. Funny thing was with the salad during the beginning of our feast. I ate the bread and the filling and had some salad as well. Then I felt terrible burning in my mouth and throat and in my head too. Honestly I felt like I am about to die. Was drinking lots of water and was wondering what was so spicy. We figured out that I had eaten a slice of jalapeno pepper which they had put inside fresh salad. So please be sure to check your salad or ask one without it, to avoid a situation like that.

NB! If you are running out of injera, ask the server and they will gladly bring it to you.

There are few nice places where to find injera, so we recommend you to find one close to your home or go to Bloor West and Danfroth where there are several restaurants for your culinary experiences."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It's really too bad that first timers to Ethiopian food are wrecking the ratings for this place. 

The service is warm but slow - yes. The decor isn't modern or urban - yes. But the food itself is pretty good. My favorite thing that they make is the Kitfo (raw), cabbage wat and quanta firfir. Is it the best Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto? Well, it's got some work to do. But in the past 2 years, I've found it to be a reliable spot for some delicious food."}
{"text":"Horrible Service , Arrogant Waitress , Great Food though!

1. Horrible Service and this Waitress from Hell

Even if the food was served faster than expected. This waitress is so arrogant and just rude and I cannot believe someone hired her. I cannot express my anger towards her service. 

So after we ordered our main dishes , I also ordered 3 slices of chocolate cake. While eating our dinner we realized that we may not have any room for desserts , so I told her if we can cancel one order of cake and she said no cause she already sent the order. Seriously you are some kind of hungry for money. 


Then while we are eating our dinner , we thought of getting some Ethiopian beer , cause I thought they do serve and so I called the lady in the bar and she responded \" yes , what do you want?\"  So we tried to order these beer and they said they do not have any. Then we moved on. 


Back to this waitress from hell, the serving are big so we asked to packed the rest that we did not finished , guess what? This bloody hell of a waitress threw a tantrum on us. RUDE RUDE RUDE

Then time to pay our food , I handed my card and waitress from hell shrugged and said \" Sorry I only accept cash and go all the way 3 blocks west to grab some cash for me\" How inconvenient, I have to pay a bank fee to get cash for this place\" At least there should be a sign that says they only accept cash\"


The food is good though , I enjoyed the food despite of this horrible service we received. I wish her all the best for her misery. I feel sorry for her attitude. 

I rather just go to the Greenwood or might as well re visit Nazareth. I did not give a tip. Well , I left a few cents. She does not even deserve to receive not even a single penny. 


I never been this upset. I am not someone who makes a scene she is not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"At one point I really enjoyed  Lalibela, but since, I have expanded my Ethiopian horizons and sampled a wider variety of Toronto's offerings, I can honestly say that this is possibly the worst one of the bunch.

Last night a couple invited us out for dinner, and we suggested Lalibela as it is super close to their house. We arrived and were seated at a dirty table, which the waitress cleaned with us seated. Fine, they are busy and don't want us clogging the entranceway, thats fine. 15 min later, the other waitress comes over to get our drink order. My friend wanted beer, and his first and second choices were not available, same as my wine choices. (I settled on \"red\") She leaves, brings our drinks after another 10, forgets 2 waters, forgets to take our food order. We flag her down and ask to order and re-ask for water. No water arrives at any point of the meal, FYI despite numerous requests. 

We ordered a vegetarian platter for 2 and a meat platter for 2 which came combined as one large platter.  It was NOT enough food for 4. usually at Ethiopian Restaurants, these platters are gluttonously overstuffed and inexpensive. We are now in for $45, and have not nearly enough food for four adults. at first I thought this was only one of the two platters we had ordered. No one came to check on us so we dived in, soon to realize that this was not going to cut it. 

We flagged the waitress down, ordered another round of drinks and a third platter. 35 min later and then 45 min we flag a waitress and ask where our platter is. ONE HOUR after FINISHING the first platter we get the new one.At this point we are tired of sitting here for almost 3 hours and inhale our food. Paying the bill took another 25 min. Completely insane.

As per other reviewers, the food here is extremely salty. And the Messir Wat (which I judge all Ethiopian Restaurants on) lacks depth and heat. The Lentils (which is usually one of my favorites) are lacking spice. 
The service is atrocious and the prices are high (comparatively)  at $24 for a mixed platter for 2. We also were never offered another plate of injera. 

Honestly, If you are giving this place more than One Star, you many want to try some other Ethiopian Restaurants in Toronto, because likely you don't know what you are missing.  Hit the Danforth strip for some quality food -- and Dukem for outstanding service."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Ethiopian food. As the 4 star rating indicates, \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" My partner and I used a Groupon so the cost of the food was very cheap. We ordered the Lalibela platter for one and the ZilZil tibs. Our inexperienced hands found it a little difficult to manoeuvre the injera bread to pick up the different foods, but the staff was kind enough to bring us some forks. I very much loved the platter which was an assortment of lentils, veggies and meat - flavour explosion in your mouth! I found the ZilZil tibs a little dry, almost like beef jerky but I think it is supposed to be that way? It was still good though. Everything was quite delicious and we were left very full."}
{"text":"Everything wrong on my visit. Weird setup, lone waitress making series of mistakes in orders, Wrong orders, no drinks, no water refill to name a few. I thought if food is good, I'll let go these things and I've to say pretty mediocre food. Doro wat was good but lamb and other vegetables weren't good in taste. Not coming again."}
{"text":"Best Veggie dish north of the border! The cha cha tips is hands down the best dish! You can't really miss with anything on the menu"}
{"text":"Eat in is great! Hence why I got delivery via JUST-EAT.CA and that turned out horrible!

1. The food does not come as they come in the restaurant- they do NOT include salad with their orders even though it is advertised on the website. 
2. the amount of food is significantly less... I would say about 60% of what you would get in the restaurant. 
3. Asked for a menu- no menu, asked for hot sauce- no hot sauce, asked for labelling on the boxes so we know who's order was whos... no label. 

When we phoned back, first they told us take out does not come with a salad... we informed them that we paid $20/meal as advertised on justeat so we kind of expect the full order... 
Then... they ignored our calls when they said \"call us back... I'll ask the boss\". 
When we finally got through with by using a different phone #... they said \"ok the driver is coming... but we don't know when.\" And OBVIOUSLY the driver never came..."}
{"text":"Decided to try Ethiopian cuisine recently. So based on a recommendation, hit up the Bloor st location for Lalibela, thankfully they had two rooms, as the first one was packed, so I was able to grab a table in their overflow room, which doubles as a nightclub. 

I would rate this place 3.5, but will not give it the lower 3 as the food and experience was overall good.

I ordered the Yeawaze tibs. This was a dish of tender beef chunks cooked in a spicy flavourful sauce, with sauteed onions and jalapeno slices. It was served on a thin pancake type roti, which you pulled apart and ate with your hands. An authentic dining experience. And quite delightful.

But as it was a Friday evening, this room filled up fast, and this was the downside. One server was allocated to deal with a room of maybe 30 patrons. After finishing dinner, it took extremely long to attempt to settle the bill. Many attempts were made to grab the waitresses attention as she ran back and forth delivering plates. Finally when the bill arrived, she rushed off and it was near 10 more minutes to pay it. All in all, it was probably a 20 minute exit, from wanting the bill to paying it. 

I'm sure on a weeknight it may not be as chaotic, but if you are in a rush, allot extra time if they habitually short staff the establishment, you will not get to where you need to go if you are looking for a quick meal. 

Will definitely try this place again as it was enjoyable, but hopefully they are staffed accordingly."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times and loved it. Both locations are great except the Bloor location is a bit tight for space but nicer ambiance.  We always have the mix meat and vege plate. Service at this Danforth location I would give 3/5 but food 4.5./5."}
{"text":"I tried out lalibela today for lunch as I heard good things from a friend. I had the lalibela platter so I could get a taste of the tibs and the vegetarian dishes. The injera was great and the 2 lentil side dishes were flavourful enough, but everything else on the plate really paled in comparison to Nazareth. On top of that it took forever to get our bill and our server was terribly unhelpful and unfriendly. Lalibela is worthy of a final rating of 2.5 stars. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Having never had Ethiopian (or Eritrean, or Djiboutan) before, this review is completely uninformed. That said, the food here was tasty but not relevatory, the prices decent but not cheap, and the decor cute but not adorable. We went here on a Dealradar special and it was entirely satisfactory."}
{"text":"I frequently visit this place and love it. Very clean, friendly, reasonable, and delicious!
The Veggie Platter is fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for lunch in downtown area. Being vegetarian, the variety is pretty good. We always order the vegetarian platter for 2. The food is very tasty and the quantity is good. My favourite are the red lentils and chickpea dishes in the platter, and I also love the Injira. I have recommend the place to many friends and look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"want to love this place! The prices are right and the food is decent. Not great. It's hit or miss. I've been 5 or 6 times and will probably be back because it's usually full (nice atmosphere) and I live so close. 

The servers are definitely nice! However, they are sooooo slow and often forget things. Or do things that make no sense, like I ordered tea and later asked for more hot water...I would expect someone to bring over a kettle but she brought another mug full of lukewarm tap water. Like, why?! 

Other times I have ordered and food came out right away and other times I have waited 45 minutes. Some times cold sometimes not."}
{"text":"Excellent meal at a very reasonable price. Great service. The best Ethiopian food I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"JUST TERRIBLE

Two of us had dinner at this restaurant recently. We saw that there were many people inside on a weekday, and as we are fans of Ethiopean cuisine, saw this as a good sign. Soon after dinner, both of us came down with food poisoning. 

We have had Ethiopian at half a dozen restaurants, in Toronto and elsewhere, and nowhere have experienced such terrible food quality. The dishes were either bland or spicy but without flavor. None of the food was raw but obviously something was cross contaminated or not cleaned sufficiently.

The staff were inattentive and inept. It took 3 of them 15 minutes to figure out how to reload the credit card machine paper in order for me to pay for the meal. In these 15 minutes I had to rush to the washroom twice.

There are many better Ethiopian restaurants - that won't food poison you! If want the possibility of gut wrenching food poisoning coupled with night sweats and missing work the next day, then by all means go eat at Lalibela."}
{"text":"Lalibela is one of the better Ethiopian restaurants I've been to -- better than some of its neighbours and the place on Irwin (near Yonge and Wellesley).  But the quality is uneven and it's time to move on and look for a new fave.  The biggest problem: I suspect they have a huge bag of salt suspended over the stove and dump a whackload on every dish. Because every time I've eaten at Lalibela lately, I've had to drink a gallon of water afterwards. Yes, the injera is good - not too sour - and the veggies are nice (more, please!), but salt doesn't have to be the primary seasoning. 

All that said, the service is friendly, and the clientele is a nice mix of Ethiopians and non. So I'm not ruling it out completely. I just don't want to end up with hypertension."}
{"text":"Very tasty food !!! Great portions too....been here so many times ....love it :-) The lamb is so flavorful .....order it everytime! We have introduced so many friends to this place and everyone loves this place. A must visit !!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LALIBELA. They're open late, the portions are gigantic, and the food is perfect. The staff are courteous and the location couldn't be better. 10/10, would."}
{"text":"Very lacklustre food. I remember coming here a few years ago and was wowed by the spices that literally danced off your palate. No more.
Our party of four was seated promptly. Unlike other reviewers, we received our food rather quickly. We ordered the Vegetarian Platter and the Bahlen Platter. Food was cold. The veggies lacked spice and spices. The meats were stale and uninspiring. Everything was overly salted - but still lacked flavour. 
The washroom was really dirty and there were scraps of food on the floor of the dining room. 
I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is my regular go-to for Ethiopian cuisine. The food is perfect every time. A veggie platter for one is so much food, you can barely imagine. Injera for days. Staff is super friendly and service is fast. Love this place.

**Updating my review, as they have been taken over by new management, and the service and food have gone way downhill. Last time we visited, the food was cold, and there was a stone or pebble in one of the dishes. The red lentil dish had so much spice in it we could barely eat it, even with tons of injera. What a shame.. it used to be such a lovely place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I fall into phases with different cuisines - we will stick to one or two cuisines for a period of time, and really scope out what Toronto has to offer. After our first experience at Lalibela, it's safe to say that we've been kickstarted into an Ethiopian phase. I love Ethiopian food!

THE GOOD:
- Awesome value. We got the lunch special for 2, which was $20 and more than filling. 
- The decor inside is funky - we sat on benches that were adorned with intricate designs. 
- Service was great. Our waitress was well-mannered, and our food came out very quickly. 
- Last but not certainly not least, I really enjoyed our food - I felt compelled to write this review because I was sitting here, still thinking about how good that minced beef, cottage cheese and spongy injera was yesterday...

THE BAD:
- Our food was just a little on the bland side - they could have kicked it up a notch. 

Overall, I'm a Lalibela fan. I can't wait to try more Ethiopian spots in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Lalibela is my \"go to\" Ethiopian restaurant.

Lalibela's menu is quite extensive and the food is very authentic.  The injera is very fresh, servings are large and the staff takes time to ensure you know what you are ordering and that you order the right amount.

My advice is to not be shy with the menu items - everything Lalibela makes is great and they provide a great opportunity to try more exotic Ethiopian dishes along with the tried-and-true standards.

Lalibela is recommended!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Ethiopian cuisine so would recommend you to take this review with a grain of salt.
Visited them for dinner last night. We walked in with very few expectations.

My wife being vegetarian tried the vegetarian platter which we liked. The injera bread was very soft and nice. It was a combination of Split Peas, Lentil, Chick Peas, cabbage, collard green and vegetables served on top of Injera bread. (12 $)
I tried the lamb curry which was pretty good too. It was very close to Indian lamb curry. And it was served in a wrought iron pan, piping hot. It was also served with Injera bread. (14 $)
We also tried their coffee service which we found very much overpriced at 14$. It was a small pot of coffee (maybe 300 ml-350 ml), served with pop-corns. The coffee was alright. But considering the prices, we feel it wasn't worth at all.
The food portions are big. So don't order too many dishes.

The service was good. However, in the end the waitress tried to enter incorrect amount in the credit card machine twice and we had to ask her to correct it. We would have overpaid if we didn't check. I would give a benefit of doubt once, but not twice.

Overall, it was a decent experience for the initiation to Ethiopian cuisine. We'll definitely try some other places to develop our palate."}
{"text":"Dinner 

Ambience: 3/5  
Food: 3.75/5 
Service: 3/5 (Friendly)
Value: 3.5/5 
Repeat: Perhaps. 

Best among the TO Ethiopian restos that I have tried."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Lalibela I thought the food was too salty, so I didn't go back for a while.. But I went there recently and the food was great! Now I'm sorry I avoided them for so long. The vegetarian platter was fresh and tasty. The service was excellent and fast. I can't recommend Lalibela enough."}
{"text":"Good sized menu and generous portions but VERY slow service.  Echo previous reviews: there was only 1 server for the whole restaurant and although she was very friendly, they definitely need 1 more person to manage the floor/bar."}
{"text":"Si quieres probar la comida etíope Lulibela es un buen lugar para ello. 
Aunque no seas fan de los veggies, anímate a probarlos! 
Ah! Y no te vayas sin probar el café, pide el Café Ceremonia y disfruta."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie platter and it was excellent!  The servers may have taken a tip from online reviews because the service has improved."}
{"text":"Great ambiance but extremely long wait for food. We ordered the Lalibela Platter and out of everything they served on it, I only enjoyed one of the chickens. Very disappointing - I was lucky I didn't pay full price or I would have been very pissed. No bueno."}
{"text":"I dined here last night with my sister and a Groupon in hand. It was her first, and my second Ethiopian cuisine adventure. 

To be able to try a few different dishes we opted for the meat combo for 2 for $38. This was perfect because our Groupon was worth $30. There was a lot of food, more than enough for two people. Service was quick and friendly and water was provided and refilled without asking.

We both really enjoyed the flavours of everything and would definitely return to try some other dishes on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"This is authentic. All there food was full of flavors.  Tried the beef rib tips and I did chicken. Tips. I enjoyed the chicken most. It was tender and moist.. the kids did a chicken burger which had it's on little flare. And mac n cheese. Which was traditional mac n cheese.  The salads are full of flavors very tasty. Also we had some lentil soup that was fresh. The only downfall is. It is slow because they are cooking it fresh. So be ready to spend some time. This was my 2nd visit here and when I return back to Toronto I will make time for another."}
{"text":"I've tried ethopian food at a couple of restaurants in Toronto and I always come back to this.  Not only because it's a great deal (when you buy the groupon) but also because the food is great.  

The decor at this place is kinda iffy, but the waitress went through great efforts to explain the menu to us and gave us a number of good suggestions on what to get (I can't eat overly spicy foods).  

We got an assorted veg/meat platter + a non-spicy beef dish.  The portions were generous and tasted great!  It's only been a week since I last came here and I am  having cravings for Ethopian food again.  

Tip: free parking on the side streets"}
{"text":"Came here with a coupon.  I can't remember what I had, but it was decent.  I'd come here again if I were in the neighbourhood.  But, I'd think I'd want to try Nazareth first before coming back."}
{"text":"BEST Ethiopian I've tried. 
GLUTEN FREE INJERA BREAD AVAILABLE!!!! WHOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Great food, nice pleasant people, place is clean, & properly insulated!! (yes, this is relevant when looking for these restaurants, went to several over winter that had to sit there in my Winter Jacket! really.)
Seriously. 
Love ethiopian cuisine, but face it, most of these places are filthy, reek of detergent. 

This place was very clean, people were polite, helpful, food was great, & great experience. 
love it, have been several times, & drove pretty far to get there, so definitely thought worth returning to. 

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Minutes after my friends and I walked into Lalibela for an impromptu late dinner (9 pm on a Sunday night), we felt like we had traveled somewhere exotic. There was a thin haze of incense and lots of smiling faces sharing big platters of food. It wasn't my first time at an Ethiopian restaurant but I loved that the staff were wearing beautiful and identical traditional dresses and their consistent friendliness was pleasant.

We were seated within minutes and though the service was slow - it was a full house - we were happy to wait. We wanted to try some of their veggie dishes and a beef dish. Our waitress recommended the veggie platter and also the Ye'Beg Key Tibbs (she told us we could substitute the lamb for beef). That was plenty of food for 3 hungry people. 

TOP PICKS: Cabbage Wat and the beef tibs (I'm sure the lamb version is just as delicious!)

BONUS: Coincidentally we found out they had a Groupon offer and we bought it on the spot! Woohoo!

The reason Lalibela doesn't get 5 stars from me is that we didn't get napkins and had to ask for them well into our meal. Not a HUGE issue normally but things get messy when you're using your hands to eat. Also the incense was overwhelming. People with allergies beware.

Overall, I'm happy to have found this gem in my new neighborhood."}
{"text":"i have never tried Ethiopian food but was pleasantly surprised! I love trying new food. The place is a bit tucked away beside many different other restaurants so isn't very visible. The decor is a bit old school but that didn't really bother me! The service was fast and with a big smile ! The server checked on us multiple times and always had a sweet smile.

We ordered the Meat combo with Spicy lamb, chicken and beef with gommen, dullet and cottage cheese. This was served with 6 rolls of injera (sourdough-risen flatbread with a unique, slightly spongy texture). The injera itself was interesting. It was a bit sour but balanced out the spiciness of the dishes so well. At first the platter came and I thought oh boy this is so small.. Those little dishes combined was actually a LOT! I couldn't even eat half of my portion. My favourite was the gommen which is a spiced beef tripe. I would come back just for that dish! I've only ever eaten asian style beef tripe. This was refreshing! The spicy chicken had such an amazing texture and sauce. 

We also ordered the baklava for dessert. This was also AMAZING!! I will come back for this. It was drizzled .. wait no.. more like drenched in this sweet sauce/paste. I asked and they said it was not made in house. Time to go searching!

At this restaurant you eat mostly with your hands. The injera is used to pick up the food and wrap it! I love hands on food !! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is pretty good but the service is awful. On my most recent visit the waitress took forever to acknowledge our presence, and she had a terrible attitude. When I asked to have the rest of my food wrapped up she brought the styrofoam box and plopped the food into it like it was cafeteria slop. I've seen people treat dog food better."}
{"text":"I thought I found my favourite Ethiopian, but I was wrong.  The place I loved was filled, so I went just a few places down and found my new fav!

The portions here are larger,  so big that me and my girlfriend rarely finish our meals.  The food is out of this world.  This is my favourite restaurant!  There is always a groupon, so the food is also dirt cheap.

This is a family business, and we have the same waitress every night.  She is very kind, nice and helpful.

Me and my girlfriend love this place so much, we go two to three times a week.  We got engaged here, so now it's even more special!

Try this place, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"This place is a great value and the food is flavourful and fresh. Service is slow but super friendly, so if you're into the idea of feeding 2 (probably 3) very hungry people for $20-30, this is a great East end Ethiopian option. 

We tried the meat platter for 2, something like $28, and it was more food than needed despite my near bottomless pit status and was fresh and nicely spiced. It came with loads of injera, and each dish was lovely and distinct- some hot, some sweet, some savoury. Would repeat."}
{"text":"After arriving in Toronto for a Lakers vs. Raptors game, my girlfriend and I decided to check this place out. 

First of all, we waited for a while to be seated. That's not necessarily a bad thing (it gave us time to collect and share our thoughts on Canada, as we were experiencing it for the first time), but it would have been nice to sit down while we were waiting. 

Once seated, we ordered the Lalibela Platter. We weren't sure if we should each order two, or if we should split. I remember our server indicating non-verbally that one order would be big enough for both of us. 

And indeed it was. I'm a hefty eater, but we barely finished the huge platter of Ethiopian bread splotched with littler piles of various veggies and meats in unnamed sauces. Everything was delicious and our bill, for two people, was very reasonable. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon. Had the house special platter with lentils, cabbage. Lamb and roast chicken. Everything was delicious.  Service was a bit lukewarm at first but they warmed up to us. I'd really recommend all of the dishes, especially the cabbage and spicy lentils.

Very decent place,"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here to try authentic Ethiopian coffee. To get this service you have to call in advance or let the waitress know as soon as you order your meal. It ended up being a really unique experience.

The waitress first brought out the beans as they were being roasted and let us smell them. Then she went back to the kitchen and brought out incense, coffee cups and a big bowl of popcorn. We aren't sure why they bring you popcorn but it was really good!

Then she brought us our coffee in a ceramic coffee pitcher. The coffee was really good and the price was unbeatable. For four of us, the coffee ritual came to $3.00 per person. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to experience an authentic Ethiopian coffee ritual. Unfortunately we did not try their food since we had already eaten."}
{"text":"We came here for a dinner one weekend evening. I had tried ethiopian food before at a different restaurant, so I was excited to eat this type of cuisine again. We also found a groupon for this place online, so we thought why not give it a try?

When you arrive at the restaurant, there's also a more casual lounge with the same name next door, so don't be confused. 

We were seated at a table for two almost immediately. This happened to be our luck, because as the night progressed, the line up continued to grow but the staff didn't seem to really be attentive to those waiting for a table. We also found that it took a while to be able to order our food. Heads up if you do come here: The service is dismissive and slow. You certainly need to plan according if you have things to do afterwards. 

We ended up ordering the LALIBELA PLATTER FOR TWO $25.00 (Combination of Vegetarian peas, lentil, cabbage, Collard green, split peas, doro wat, Lamb or Beef dish arranged on the platter). It was really disappointing that the quality of the food was so poor (was pretty cold too). The worst thing was that I had food poisoning! I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Can beat this Ethiopian restaurant!  This one is for sure my favourite.  Food is AMAZING, service is fabulous and ambiance is chill!!!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good food 
The meat was delicious 
Used Groupon got 30$ worth of food for 4.99$
Highly recommend using groupon.
I ordered : 
Meat combination palette ( well done ) (Extra Spicy )
Came with different kind of meats, salad, and injera
Mango juice"}
{"text":"I ate there with two friends. Great food, good service, nice atmosphere. Will certainly visit again when I'm in the area. I finished my platter but my friends couldn't equal my effort!"}
{"text":"After eating the food, my stomach was upset for several hours. After carefully examining the words on the menu which is only in Ethiopian, we needed the waitress to translate and finally we order the mixed meat dish, that came with 'lamb', 'beef', collard greens, feta cheese, chicken and salad. When you say lamb or beef, you would assume you're getting chunks/strips of lamb or beef. It was lamb stomach and ground beef! Waitress totally mislead us. I was really disappointed in the food. It did not taste good, never again am I coming to this establishment."}
{"text":"I have said it before and I will said it again: Ethiopian food is truly one of my favorite cuisines. 

Sure, I love me some French, Spanish, Middle East, Indian, Asian... okay, I am going to stop now, as I like a LOT of cuisines. The point is, I am a great dinner date.

But I digress, the fact is that from a healthy, taste, simple, aesthetic and veggie friendly cuisine: Ethiopian is hard to beat.

There has been a ton of new (yet unproven) Ethiopian restaurants springing up on Queen West (really West) and on both ends of Bloor/Danforth however Lalibela has been at it for years! 

In fact, along with Nazareth and The Ethiopian House, Lalibela is part of the old guard, preparing veggie friendly dishes for what feels like ages. 

How is the food then? It is like coming home. I find the food delicious and tasty. The platters are large and filling. Their Lalibela Platter is pretty much the best mix if you want a bit of everything although a tad more expensive than places like Nazareth. So keep that in mind as it might add a few extra bucks at the end of the bill, specially with larger groups. Their rare beef dishes are succulent and I am glad they make them.  

I would say that although it might not have je ne sais quoi of Nazareth's decor nor the convenience of the Ethiopian House, it also does not have the crazy lineups of the former nor the often indifferent service of the latter. 

When it comes to food quality, I would say that Nazareth and Lalibela (with two locations!) are probably your best bets for a night of delicious Ethiopian food. 

Just remember, TRY not to use your left hand to eat, it is considered inappropriate."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ethiopian resto maybe its because it was the first or maybe its just that good.

First time coming here I had no idea what to get so I just had the Lalibella platter and it was huge especially for one person.  The platter had a mixture of vegeterian dishes such as lentils, cabbage (my favorite), collard green, peas and doro wat. It also comes with a choice of beef or lamb stew. I had the lamb and it did not dissappoint, it was not dry or oily like most of the lambs I had. The injera itself is really good some Ethiopian restaurant has that sour taste in it but Lalibela does not and you can get as much you want.

Food - 5/5
Recommedations - Lalibella Platter, Cabbage platter"}
{"text":"The decor is just fabulous. 
All the walls are painted, the menu is decorated in coffee beans and straw and just...cuteness. 

This isn't the best Ethiopian food I've had, but it was solid. 
The restaurant is a lovely ambiance and the menu is vast. I think I prefer the food at the other location, near Ossington, but the actual restaurant at this location. 

The prices are pretty average (for my experience, anyway) and the service was fast here-usually I find Ethiopian food takes a long time but this place was super quick. 

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I like to come here every 3-6 months. I'm not huge on injera, so every quarter to half a year is enough to get my fix. 
I have loved this place every single time I went, except the last. 

The (beautiful) waitress is really helpful in helping you choose a dish and (again other than my last visit) they are always delicious. Unfortunately the last time I went the dish she recommended tasted like old Chinese food (which is very strange) but I've been probably 10 other times and each time it has been delicious, so I'm going to just assume it was a one-off bad day and give it another try, because honestly the food is generally really good and filling. 

Prices are decent, they have Groupons available for this place a lot, so if you are nervous about going, wait for a Groupon to be available and that should cover half the meal for 2-3 people. 

The place is usually pretty packed but on a week night you can usually get a seat without having to wait."}
{"text":"Did not feel the food was good quality, had better Ethiopian elsewhere
Had the meat combo
Service excellent, and greatly improved the place
Gave it a try because of a Groupon, but would not return. Prefer Ethiopian House dt."}
{"text":"Was in the neighbourhood and craving Ethiopian food. I've been meaning to give it another shot. 

We ordered a lamb dish and veggie platter for one. We were STUFFED to the gills after, even though we just wanted a small meal. Everything was delicious and I had to physically stop myself to gorging past my limit.

Very VERY pleased, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious but service is terrible. I've witnessed both dishonesty (charge too much and lie) and rudeness. Not going back there again"}
{"text":"The vegetarian platter was enough for two people and included a combination of splint peas, lentils, chick peas, cabbage, collard greens, vegetables, and hilbet (mixer of beans, garlic, ginger, and fenugreek).

The kitfo was also served in the vegetarian platter.  We were also given a plate of injera (it was folded up and warm).  To eat it, you tear off the injera and use it to scoop up whatever you wanted on the platter.  The red powder in the small container was some spice that you could use to sprinkle on your food before you ate it.

I liked the kitfo.  It was different from usual steak tartare because it was lukewarm and a little spicy.  It was very lean and meaty and I didn't detect the butter in it at all."}
{"text":"Great food and cute location, clean and nice atmosphere. I liked learning about the town in Ethiopia that the place is named after (info on the menu) . The veggie plater is amazing. The girl who served me was nice but wasn't overly helpful and sometimes took a lil bit of time to check on our table. On my second time there an elderly man who seemed to know the staff, not sure if he's the owner, started listening to Ethiopian radio really loud and close to us, we had to raise our voices to talk to each other and they or the waitress didn't seem to care. So that wasn't too nice. But overall, it's a good place and I'll certainly go back."}
{"text":"Good food and the staff are great at leaving you be to chat after dinner; however, when we asked for our bill, we had to wait 40 minutes and ask for it four times. Not sure if I enjoyed the food enough for a return experience."}
{"text":"The best Ethiopian food in the city. Huge portions and the food is so good. The service is great the wait staff is so helpful. Keeping going back for more!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Ethiopian food and I thought this place was just OK. 

We ordered vegetarian dishes and a lamb dish because one of the people we were with is a vegetarian. They brought out one big plate with all of the orders combined, so the sauce from the lamb dish mingled in places with some of the veg dish. Fortunately, there were dishes on the opposite side that didn't make contact, but sad for the person we were with that a few sauces married and they didn't feel like trying the meat-infused veg ones. 

Also, we specifically ordered the coffee before our meal so that it would be ready by the end of dinner since we know it takes around an hour to make. Well, seems that they forgot we ordered it, or just decided to make it at the end of the meal because once we were done eating, it took another 50 minutes for coffee to show up. Our friends frequent Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto, and they said that the coffee was muddier and not as rich in flavor as many other places they have been. 

So overall, flavors were ok, staff was friendly, but the meal took over 2 hours and wasn't very memorable."}
{"text":"Another way to find new places to try is Groupon. I thought this would be an interesting experience and came here with a group of friends.

We shared the Lalibela platter, Goden Tibs and Chiko. Portions were generous, and food was very flavourful and delicious. The server recommended all the above dishes and I'm glad we ordered it. The platter offered a variety of meat and non-meat options, perfect for larger parties!

Aside from the location being away from downtown core, it's not a bad trek to visit Greektown for delicious Ethiopian food. It was also very fun to just eat with my hands, I felt like a kid again. Here, I finally won't be yelled at by my parents for playing with my food. It's fun!"}
{"text":"I ate Ethiopian food for the first time in Lalibela, and it's a place I periodically keep coming back to, introducing friends to its extensive plates of good food with plenty of injera and strong black coffee delivered, with ceremony, with a side order of popcorn. (It actually does work.)

I love Lalibela. So far, the friends I've taken to this restaurant, often exposing them to Ethiopian food for the first time, agree with me about this."}
{"text":"I love this place and have so for a long time now. I think I've tried other ethiopian places around town but keep coming back to Lalibela. This place just makes the best food, in my opinion. Now granted I am not at all Ethiopian but there seems to be large representation by the local diaspora so that can't be a bad omen.
I always get the veggie platter for my wife and I and it never disappoints.
I used to be able to get these amazing stuffed chillies but for some time now they have not been available...HUGE disappointment. Wish they'd come back!
Other than that, I really recommend this place...as a matter of fact, we're gonna go this week :)"}
{"text":"Located close to the intersection of Bloor and Ossington Streets, Lalibela offers authentic Ethiopian cuisine (as well as standard selections such chicken patties) at affordable prices.  Having always wanted to try Ethiopian cuisine, I purchased a dining deal from LivingSocial.com and went with a friend for a Saturday lunch.  Staff was attentive and welcoming which was great, however, the decor was a bit too rudimentary. As for food, I ordered their 'Dero Tibbs' dish (chicken sauteed with spiced butter, garlic, Green pepper, served with injera bread) although it looks good on the menu, the actual food was lackluster in taste.  I am happy that I got an opportunity to try food from another culture, however, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience. Take note: they only take reservation when is party of 5 or more.  My friend got there early and waited 30 minutes and still couldn't get a table.  Then the staff told us we could go next door.

It seems like they had recently expanded their space, the \"next door\" appeared to be a formal Japanese restaurant in transition of a makeover. It u fortunately did not have the decor and charm and ambience of the original one but I think this will change with time. 

The food was simply delicious. The pancake was fluffy with slightly sour smell and sweetness mixed in.  I like that you have little portion of everything.  We got the meat combo with a side dish of lentil and couldn't finish our food. I only wish I had room for dessert.

I do wish they have the Ethiopian honey wine though..."}
{"text":"Great food with average service. It was a Monday night so we didn't expect it to be so busy but it was. And there seemed to be one waitress serving the length of the restaurant. We waited about 45 minutes for two dishes to arrive. Thankfully everything was hot and still sizzling so that wasn't the issue. But getting service definitely was. The coffee ceremony was a bit of a let down and the popcorn was burnt. That itself was $16 and not worth it. I give the food 4 stars but service was 3. I'm not in any rush to come back here."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: this was my first time trying Ethiopian food, but I did read up on it and go with someone who'd had it a couple times.

I didn't find the injera to be sour at all, although it was certainly spongy. They didn't give nearly enough napkins considering you eat with your hands - like seriously, one napkin and one wet wipe per person? Am I supposed to use the injera?

The food. I got the Mama in the Kitchen with chicken and I didn't like it. The flavors were unappealing and not nearly as intense as they should have been (food smelled MUCH better than it tasted), the textures were weird (grainy, saucy stuff just smeared on the injera), the vegetables were really limited (just starches and legumes, basically), and they didn't give nearly enough injera. I also felt that the stews and such were watery enough that the bottom piece of injera was basically inedible after you finished one or two samples of food. I wanted to leave right away when I tasted this, but I hate paying for food and not eating it.

Service was fine, if brusque and inattentive. Place is clean but has mainly booths. Outside seating area looks really annoying and meant there were a lot of bugs around. Would I come back? Nope."}
{"text":"You have to enjoy this type of food first of all. Great for vegetarians. Their plates are more than enough to share between two people. By far best Ethiopian in Toronto coming from someone who loves their Ethiopian food! The fish here is amazing"}
{"text":"TASTY! We got a Groupon Now! for this restaurant on Valentines day of all days. We've been there once before but hubs and I have NO idea what to order off an Ethiopian menu - ever - so we went with the recommendation of combo #46 from the waitress.

When it came out you really remember why they're starving in Ethiopia. Seriously I could have eaten 2 of those platters AT LEAST. Why was there only one drum stick on the platter? For me and hubs to fight to the death over it Hunger Games style? 

I finally told the waitress that we want an order of the beef tibs. I have heard of these \"tibs\" things forever, and for some reason we never order them! Turns out \"tibs\" are cubes of meat. Go figure. 

Either way the food is delish!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Ethiopian cuisine, so this review would be slightly skewed.

We came across this place from a Groupon and decided to try it out! Walking into the restaurant, the place was very clean and it had a nice open window - perfect for a nice summer day in Toronto. We were given our menus and drinks right away and the staff member was also really nice.

Coming for the first time, we decided to go with what we thought was a signature dish - the Lalibela Platter. This consisted of 5 or more of their famous vegetarian stews and it is served on a platter of injera. The food came very fast and the presentation was amazing! The staff member also came with several other small injera for us to eat the dish with.

My first time trying injera, it's a spongy dish and it tasted a little sour to me. We didn't look at how Ethiopian dishes are eaten, but since there are no spoons and forks provided, we figured we were to eat with our hands.

The vegetarian dishes were really delicious. They were all chopped up finely, so it was very easy to bite into and the taste was delicious. If you're not a spicy eater though, I would be a little careful when you eat the curry dishes. The chicken was a little spicy for my liking, but still fairly tender."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the owner has an attitude and she is not very friendly. Our server was a very polite and nice girl though, she tried to help us a lot as we wanted to use our Groupon but the owner didn't let her and spoke so rudely to her. 
We had a much better experience at the other location."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Ethiopian food, so I have no standard to compare it to. That being said, the food was pretty good. The various fillings were hot, but the injera was not. The injera was slightly sour/acidic tasting. I've been told that was intentional. It wasn't a bad thing. It was just surprising.

We used a Groupon, and it was plenty for two. There was a chickpea stew, a lentil stew, shredded beets, a stewed chicken drumstick, marinated potato chunks and cabbage, an almost coconutty lamb stew and another lamb stew which was a separate dish. Total came to $33.90 before Groupon discount.

Service was delightful. The only mishap was that the server neglected to give us tissues until we were almost halfway through our meal. I understand though, because it was very busy tonight. 

I enjoyed the food, but the ambiance of the restaurant is what might deter me from coming again. The restaurant is very dark. It's darker than steakhouse mood lighting. I understand that they have a coffee ceremony, but that coffee ceremony includes a lot of smoke, which sometimes makes the air a tad thick. The tables are very close together, so there's a total lack of privacy. I prefer not being able to hear everything diners at other tables are saying, and I prefer them not being able to hear everything I am saying as well. The tables here are made for something like two to four people, so if you want to come with a big group, you might want to re-think your restaurant choice.

Eating with my fingers was an interesting experience for which I am not docking stars, but I don't think it's really my thing. I'd probably come again, but if someone else really wanted to come, and not because I was really craving this food. That all being said, if someone has not tried Ethiopian food, this is not a bad place to try it."}
{"text":"The restaurant looked like a local favourite. It was a good mix of Ethiopian people and the rest of us. The service was below par. We had to wait for 2-3 minutes before the hostess acknowledged us, even though we were the only ones waiting to be seated. We had to wait another 15 minutes to just get a glass of water and our order took almost 30 minutes to come. 

The food itself was okay. Do not order chicken dishes as they do not do a good job on the chicken. Their lamb dishes are better made."}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian and it was delicious! Got the vegetarian platter and a beef dish, glad I added the meat because it added more flavour to the overall experience. Large portions. Saw another table get the \"traditional coffee experience\" and it looked amazing and smelled delicious, definitely would like to try it next tune. Service is a little slow so do not go when you're very hungry or in a rush!"}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times, normally with a Groupon :) back again today! Depending on time you go the wait could be 30 mins or none at all. The smells are always as amazing as the decor of colorful walls textured painted bright colors.  

The staff is always nice whether they are busy or not. 

The food!!!!!

The meat platter is my normal order with a range of different raw and cooked meats! Love their lamb and raw beef, all on a large piece of injera soaking up the sauces! 

I've had their lentil soup, salads, and fish soup as well and all are really flavorful and large portions. 

They have cheap wine and beer :) 

My go to place for Ethiopian cuisine for the service as much as the food!"}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian in Toronto! I've been looking for a quality replacement Ethiopian restaurant ever since Addis Ababa got lousy and then eventually closed. I've been to all the places in Toronto and finally I've found another good one! I was hesitant because I've been to Lalibela on Bloor and it's just average but this place is much better than the location on Bloor West. Good job!"}
{"text":"A small but cozy place to have Ethiopian food. Friendly service, reasonable price, generous portion. Food? hit or miss

We got a meat platter (four different \"dishes\" to sample, cottage cheese, and salad in the middle). Hit or miss. My boyfriend and I liked two out of four. The salad was SO sour (almost inedible). The beef dish was inedible (too rare, no seasoning, and I tried to mask that unpleasant raw beef taste with other stew but didn't help.... that's how bad it was). I never ever leave any meat on my plate...what a shame :( We both liked injera (made with teff which is considered to be one of those healthy ancient grains) which has this soft texture to it. 

Overall, it was fun eating with our hands. Good for an experience."}
{"text":"This is was my first time eating Ethiopian food. And it's safe to say that it won't be the last. As a new vegan, I was delighted to be informed by my Ethiopian friend that the vegetarian platter was vegan.

The injera was delicate and scrumptious and served with a variety of vegetable and lentil-based sides which included beetroot, spinach and collard greens, chickpeas, and so on. 

Most of the accompaniments have a very subtle flavour. There were a few side dishes which were deemed \"spicy\" by my friends but I found it to be rather mild. 

Lalibela was a good experience overall but the service could be improved."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Nice decor, very comfortable seats Clean place (except for the bathrooms) 
The food was very tasty, full of flavour.  The coffee ceremony was very nice.  Coffee and popcorn tasted very good. Very satisfying. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm sure many of you have not had Ethiopian food. You are probably deciding right now if you want to give this place a try. Stop thinking and go!

This experience was unlike any other I've ever had. There is something so primal, yet enjoyable about eating with your hands. The soft injera combined with spicious stews made the meal really unique. 

The Groupon made the price really affordable and a great bang for your buck. Make sure you come hungry because the portions are big!"}
{"text":"The food here is tasty. Lots of flavour. Didn't really know what to order as I did not know any of the main entree. 

But lucky there is a catch all menu item called meat combination. Well, we were here to try their dishes so meat combination sounds right. It was delicious but be hungry. The meat combination for 2 can really serve 4. 

I recommend this place if you wanna try authentic Ethiopian food. Not that I know what authentic Ethiopian food is but the place felt and food tasted authentic."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 vegetarian platters to go with gluten-free Teff injera (which truly was GF, so a point for that). Two more pros for a reasonable variety of vegan dishes in the platter -- beets, green beans,collard, spicy red lentil, yellow split pea, mild green lentil and cabbage/potato/carrot -- and for the fact that this is one of the least greasy Ethiopian restaurants. 

The cons were that none of the 3 legume dishes were thoroughly cooked, but crunchy. This is both unpleasant and indigestible. The green beans were more greyish and limp and were obviously previously frozen with absolutely no flavour or even onion to help out. Besides undercooked legumes,  the overall flavour was just not there. This is not Rendez-Vous, where every dish tastes excellent. All the vegetable dishes were terribly under-seasoned; I don't expect everything to be spicy hot, but I do expect the proper spices to be used with a skillful hand to create nuanced flavours in each dish. 

Collards and beans should be a bright, fresh green. Both were greyish. If beans are not in season, add more cabbage instead (but also some turmeric and ginger!)

This was just bland. Very similar to Ethiopiques in quality. I won't be returning. It's not like the Ethiopian restaurants on Danforth east."}
{"text":"Yassss! An Ethiopian restaurant in the Danforth area that's open on Mondays! One star for super great operating hours and another star for the patio (there wasn't much restaurants in the area today offering outdoor seating so this was a bonus!). The interior is decorated lovely with cozy brown booths, a welcoming bar and a very light incense smell that is very pleasant. The server was very friendly as well. 

I sat on the patio for a stella artois under the sun and took my Lalibela platter to go. Thank goodness the price is much more reasonable here - i think it was about 25 including the beer. Although the platter is advertised to come with chicken they were accommodating enough to let me have lamb instead. 

The veggies (cabbage, green lentils) were well seasoned as was the tender bone-in lamb. Beets! I've never had beets in my platter - I guess this is what makes it a special Lalibela platter! It was a nice touch. I think i prefer to have it in a cold salad. 

I was disappointed that the portion was so small so I would normally take two stars off for a lower value for money (very small portion of meat especially) but due to the other excellent factors of this restaurant I'll give it a solid four star review. Perhaps they serve larger portions when you dine in the lounge. I'd definitely like to find out for myself. Well recommended."}
{"text":"Great food and service!

It was the first time coming for my girlfriends and I. 

We ordered the Libela Special platter, and beef ribs platter to share and we were stuffed. We ended up packing half of it home. 

The menu was a bit confusing for newbies like me. At least there are lots of photos. 

I would definitely come back even without a Groupon if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I heard about Ethiopian food on internet and it looked very healthy and special. So I really wanted to try it and found this restaurant in Toronto luckily.  The food served there was truly tasty and authentic because there were lots of African people in the restaurant. 

I ordered Vegetarian platter for one ($11+ tax) for lunch and was shocked by its large portion!! There are various kinds of vegetables including beans, cabbage and beet roots served on a big injera ( sourdough flatbread). Very delicious!! I love the smell of spices and injera was very suitable to eat by hand. Another injera in same size was also included this dish. I only eat half of them...

Although the service was not good but I would go back for the food.Next time I want to take the lamb or beef dishes~"}
{"text":"Please remind me to stop getting suckered in by Groupons ... 

Lackluster - completely typical of most other Ethiopian places : \"starter kit\" decor and food, apathetic service (I was ready to walk out shortly before someone finally came to the table), unprofessional and completely unhelpful. Wouldn't answer any menu questions. One of the veg dishes tasted exceptionally meaty ... Left that one out of my takeout order at my request but didn't replace it with the one we asked for.

While the ambience sucked (casual local somewhat shady clientele), the decor was OK - still cookie-cutter. On the bright side, food came out quick -Probably because it only needs to be moderately warmed up from sitting around all day ... 

Where are all the good Ethiopian restaurants with more unique, fresh made food and actual service? 

PS the desserts here looked appalling (box-cut)."}
{"text":"My first time trying Ethiopian food and the wonderful coffee ceremony. I absolutely loved it here, my friends and I were there for hours and was never bothered by the waitresses. Wonderful atmosphere and food was awesome. I had the veggie platter for two and the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"I keep going back, it's an addiction really. There meat and vegetables are just delicious and though at busy times the staff can be a bit dodgy, it's something I've experienced at even the fanciest of restaurants. So no complaints here.
LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Shared the lunch special with my husband, which consists of kitfo, tibs, a bit of gomen wat, and salad. The food was super tasty and the portions huge. I probably should have read the menu a bit more closely because I noticed lamb in what I thought were beef tibs, but this is only a note for people who don't like lamb (I don't-- so just pay attention unlike me lol, not a note for the restaurant). I used a Groupon for my order ($15 for $30 worth of food), which is a great deal if you are a little hesitant to try something new. I'm not new to the cuisine, just a student... so it's good for that too! Our waitress was lovely and offered a piece of cake when a side order was forgotten. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Really missed Ethiopian food so on the hunt to find a good location in Toronto. My boyfriend gave me a sweet surprise by bringing me to this location on a Friday night. Location was packed but there wasn't a lineup, only filled tables and great conversation with a family friendly ambiance. That said, the interior decor is a tad run down and washroom had a moldy smell. Place is located on the corner of Bloor & Ossington, with free street parking along Ossington after 6 pm on certain stripes. Would have given a 4 star for the food, but they put me on a seat that was a completely drenched couch and advised me after I sat down, so ended up eating dinner with a wet bottom. Lovely childhood memories in bed lol 

The variety of spices with a hint of lime always is a surprise to my tastebuds, but so flavourful and pleasant. The chicken is phenomenal. Plenty of variety and flavours that each stood out on its own. The presentation is so warming and eye catching with different colours and aromas that mingle and dance with each other on the main platter. There's something about eating with you hands with company that makes the experience so much more personal and because your hands are oily and messy, you're completely focused on the food and your company and not your phone; unless you want to add some spice and aroma to your smart phone screen. Price is reasonable at approximately $30 for two and a filled belly that makes you think you're impersonated Santa. 

Definitely a go if you're not into the interior decor or ambiance, but for the food, would love to come back. My only disappointment is I don't live closer!"}
{"text":"Bless Groupon for providing a $30 value groupon for $15! This place is such a treat and I'm so glad I came here. My friend and I ordered the special ye'beg tibbs ($14) and the Lalibela platter for one ($17). The meats were soo nicely cooked and tender. The salad was okay although I would have liked less dressing as it was entirely soaked. The platter was really nice and plentiful with different vegetables and meats which is great for trying new things. The injera was as expected, spongey and soft. The only complaint I have regarding the meats is we were a bit surprised that there were bones in our meat however it didn't deter from our experience. We really enjoyed our food and would come here again!"}
{"text":"I think what impressed me the most, besides the friendly service, was the incredible value. We had the Lalibela Special For 2, and it was an enormous amount of food - a whole assortment of delights. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the greens, but everything was delicious, spiced well, and absolutely excellent. One of the better Ethiopian meals I've ever experienced. And the coffee... perfect."}
{"text":"I've had Ethiopian food before, but after this experience I realize it was westernized.   And that's a good thing.  Me and my girlfriend had the meat platter for two, and I have to say some of the selections were left almost untouched (I am looking at you trip-something-curry-something).  Not for the faint of heart.  Only the chicken drumstick curry selection can be called truly tasty, the rest was hit and miss, from the inedible tripe selection, to the only a bit more edible something-green-with-rice, and completely inedible something that looked like raw ground beef.

Some reviewers recommended one first start with the veggie platter - I guess we should have done that.  Not coming back though (this stretch of the danforth has multiple Ethiopian places, mostly frequented by Ethiopians)."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon on a Saturday evening and it was packed. I usually don't use Groupon as I'm hesitant about the service if you use one, but this has turned out to be a positive one. Why pay more, when you can pay less? 

Made reservations for 7pm - and didn't get a seat around 7:30ish. Once we sat down, it seemed like they were shuffling people around for quite a bit. It seemed like they were maximizing the space for those who had larger groups but it was quite annoying to have to move each time. 

I never had Ethiopian food but the food wasn't bad at all! We had some meat platter and how you would eat it is they would give you some foam, spongy break and you can pick up the food with the bread and eat it. No utensils required although your hands will get really dirty so you are going to have to wash them afterwards. There was just so much food for the platter for 2, we were not able to finish it. I guess you can take it home, but it wouldn't taste as great if you took it home. We also ordered the espressos afterwards, but maybe we can try the coffee ceremony as recommended from other reviews next time?  

Just realized they also forgot to give us the lentil soup we ordered, but eventually they just got rid of it on our bill as we were so full from the platter to have soup haha."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend as it seemed to be the only Ethiopian restaurant in the area that was open for lunch, and we were lucky that it was open! Place was also quite busy for a weekday afternoon, so we knew it was a popular choice.

We ordered the Lalibela Platter for Two and ended up having enough food to fully stuff us, and still had some left over. The platter is an excellent choice because you get to sample a good variety of their most popular options, and comes with plenty of bread to eat with it. We kind of wished that our server pointed out what each of the items were on the platter, but we managed to figure it out after we tasted each thing. Each item was packed with flavour, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

Price is very good for the quantity and quality of food you get. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon and I must say, was very pleased with it. We ordered a meat platter which was absolutely delicious. I truly enjoyed the different spices, and different vegetable combinations, paired very well with the injera. 
Additionally, I highly recommend the coffee. It is quite unique and has a wonderful taste. I appreciate the wonderful service and very hospitable staff. 
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food here is quite tasty as others have mentioned.  We got the vegetarian platter for 2.  

It came out pretty quick too (10 min or so?) which is AMAZING, given every other Ethiopian or Caribean type restaurant in Toronto seems to have servers who take FOR-E-V-E-R to deliver even the simplest of orders.  For that, they get an extra star.

The location has mini booths too, which is a nice touch.  Although they aren't high booths so it's not too intimate.

I wouldn't say the place isn't the cleanest though.  The bathrooms aren't at least.  

It's a bit strange they offer fish and chips, burgers, etc on the menu, along with a whole bunch of other unrelated things.  The menu is huge and broad.  That makes me nervous.  The need to hold such a wide inventory of food types suggests some foods are going to have low turnover."}
{"text":"They decorate it very nicely. I got the Lalibela Platter, which comes with a variety of veggie and some chicken and beef. I enjoyed the beef curry and the chicken curry. The veggie is OK. Next time, I will order the meat platter because I love their meat. 

My mother got the fish plate. I don't remember the name but it's really amazing. 

The only thing that really bother me is that we ordered a house salad. We expect it to come in a separate dish. But they just added a small spoonful of salad to our platter tray and charged us $5 for that salad. And it taste horrible, very sour, like they dropped the whole bottle of vinegar."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for Lalibela and I like Ethiopian so we went for some good doro wat and injera. We ordered the Mama's Kitchen for two which came with 6 vegetarian dishes (including the salad) on injera plus a small bowl of doro wat and a plate of about 5 extra rolls of injera. The vegetable dishes ranged in heat from mild to spicy and all were tasty. The doro wat was mostly chicken breast and while flavorful, could've used some dark meat mixed in. The quantity was more than enough for two and I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Groupon with the thought of let's just try it out? We were wow'ed! It was our first experience having Ethiopian food and it was great! The waitress was patient and took us through the menu. We ordered a veggie platter and was stuffed. 

Highly recommend you try the coffee ceremony to top off your meal. It's a great experience and good coffee!"}
{"text":"Yummy Ethiopian food. The portions seemed a bit small for the price though. Otherwise, I preferred the decor and ambiance of Lalibela over the Rendez-Vous. The staff were also more friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Ethiopian in the city. The food is consistently great, the injera is always fresh and unlimited and the staff is friendly. You can almost always get a table right when you walk in (unlike Nazareth) and they could probably do with an extra server on busy nights but they still fare pretty well. 

#47 (veggie platter with fish goulash) is my personal favourite. The fish is incredible melt in your mouth awesomeness and all aspects of the veggie platter are great. Their kitfo is also pretty decent. 

I don't get why their rating on here isn't higher, but I definitely recommend this place a million times over."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with Ethiopian, the spices taste great, lots 'o lentils and you get to eat with your hands!

What I love most about Lalibela is that their injera bread tastes super authentic and I may be wrong, but believe that they use a brown Teff flour to prepare it.

We requested our veggie platter to come with extra heat, but perhaps they didn't believe us because it wasn't spicy.

If your going to fill your tummy with good food Lalibela won't disappoint, but the decor isn't too easy on the eyes"}
{"text":"Ok so 2 for 1 in reviews here! First part aka this part, is myself, the second part is (probably a shorter more pissed off read) my partner. 

This is strictly on delivery service. We ordered the veggie platter for 2 with a diet coke and a single injara on JUST EAT. That cost just under $40. That isn't even the  worst part. As pleasant as the delivery people were the meal came in one sloppily filled carton. One mushy injara filled with an assortment of different coloured mush. This presentation nightmare could of been avoided if they just sent the it in a compartmentalized carton with the injara separate. I mean people would rather platter it themselves than make an otherwise nice meal look like something you should be served in a trough. IMO the least I'd give them is a 3 I imagine if we went in not even accounting for service but good god delivery has room for improvement. The coke was also wrong for good measure. The portions seemed off for the price too. African Palace kills this place.

PT.2

Terrible delivery! They charge a $4.00 delivery fee and give you a pile of mush mixed together!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place. The food was delicious, and served fast.
No spoons no forks provided, didn't know that, so we didn't ask for forks or spoons, I think this what makes unique.

will go again.
It's better with group dining."}
{"text":"Went in today after reading all the pleasant reviews on here, but i was quite disappointed. The service- as others have mentioned, is horrible. There is one server and the restaurant was quite busy, with over 50% of it filled with customers for a tuesday night. She disappears occasionally and makes you wonder if she's preparing the food herself too. Being fond of Indian and Pakistani cuisine, especially the 'daal', the lentils in my veggie platter were not suitable for my taste buds. That being said, I enjoy trying new cuisine and was more than willing to experiment at Lalibela. The other green cooked vegetable dish in my platter had a strong cardamon taste- I would not recommend this to anyone. My friend tried the beef sizzler tibs, a better option than my veggie platter. Although the beef was rather dry, it was still edible. The bread, injera was alright, somewhat tasteless and spongy as well."}
{"text":"The food is very flavorful and I would go again but only for the food. The server let another girl who came in after me have a table... then i got the bar since i was waiting for my friend. I had to ask for a table. The skinny server was nicer thank goodness. She smiled and made the service more pleasant. Other than that.... the others were not as nice. The service is horrible though and after waiting for my friend to come as I was seated in a table I asked for, in less than 5 mins the server asks me if I'm going to order something or not. I hastily place my order... the food was delicious. I would go again only for the food... I gave them a 15% tip though because I feel that servers that aren't happy.... are not treated well in their workplace. I could be wrong."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Good food.  Decent prices (a but more than others in the area). The spices are not overwhelming,  well done.  Waitress was kind enough to show us how to use the injafa even though we already knew, she just wanted to make sure.  The only negative was the volume of the music."}
{"text":"It is great to now have some many choices for Ethiopian food. We used to only go to Ehiopian house, but now there are so many more restaurants. Lalibela is definitely one of the more reasonably priced. 

We went on a Friday night and definitely come before 7pm because for some reason there were a few couples waiting for a table around 7:30pm. 

There were three of us, very hungry, so we ended up ordering a meat combination and a vegetarian platter. There were two dishes that we liked on the meat combination, but everything on the vegetarian platter was amazing. We also ordered two ginger tea, basically yellow label tea with slices of ginger. We liked it.

Definitely going back, with or without groupon. Make sure you wash your hands really good before leaving the restaurant, or else your fingers will smell (their spices are delicious, except when it lingers on your fingers for two days)"}
{"text":"Elvis Presley lived an interesting life.    

Catapulted into fame at an extremely young age, he was often at the whim of the handlers and hangers-on who guided his out-of-control career.    

Sure, Elvis could sing... and he could look good... but that's pretty much where it ends.    Good taste was never amongst Elvis's strengths in his arsenal of skills.   So he outsourced.... hiring Memphis's most gaudy and ostentatious interior designers to craft the rooms of Graceland, his home and castle.   When visiting Graceland, you cannot help but be taken aback by the so-called 'Jungle Room', a spectacular mess of colors and textures that's so surreal that it you'd think that it was a massive experiment or one-of-a-kind smashterpiece. 

Which brings us to the interior of the Ethiopian Lalibela Restaurant.    

There are suns and smiley faces.   There are cushions and carpeting.  There are the most spectacularly heart-stopping artistic designs.   Basically, it's as close as you can get to being in the Jungle Room at Graceland without jumping on the TCB plane down to Tennessee.

Elvis ate fried peanut-butter-and-banana sandwiches.   They don't serve those here.   But they do have a delicious assortment of well-priced communal dishes that are both well-spiced and  well-prepared.     

We ordered the Lalibela combo.   There's lots of food and much of it was quite delicious.   The lamb dish was particularly excellent.

For some reason there was a chicken drumstick on our injara...  I can only assume that this was a tribute to The King... God knows he loved his chicken.

There are plenty of Ethiopian restaurants in this part of Blossington...   aside from the interesting decor and notably friendly staff, there was little else to differentiate it from the competition."}
{"text":"it was GREAT! the DULAT is super! great spice level. we ordered the meat and vege platter (seperately because I wanted the DULAT) and the service was great, a young girl was very helpful in deciding and checking up on us during our meal... this last experience was better than the last few, we were at the Danforth location."}
{"text":"Food and service mediocre, cake was old and stale. Vegetable options tasted better than meat options on the platter. Place was fairly busy throughout the night but we probably wouldn't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Had my first and only (for now) time trying Ethiopian here so I don't have anything to compare it to but it was a cool experience! Not sure what I was eating but it tasted so good. The only thing is that the injera has a taste I didn't expect, kind of sour actually so I didn't eat it as much as I used it to scoop the other food into my mouth. Great experience and nice servers! This place definitely makes me feel more open to trying other Ethiopian food. Also you be prepared to try to find street parking or take transit!"}
{"text":"We came back here for a second time and the result is that I've given up on Ethiopian in Toronto and were sadly disappointed.  We had a Lalibela special for two.  The wot was incredibly sweet; the lentils, gomen and split peas underspiced, and everything was just kind of bland.  The kitfo was probably the highlight and even that wasn't flavorful. 

I love Ethiopian food, but not enough that mediocre Ethiopian is worthwhile.  The highlight of the night was dancing to the music playing on the video screen."}
{"text":"Have been there 3 times and the food/service has been amazing. This location is 10 times better food than the Bloor location. Veg platter is good, lots of options for tibs and their chicken is also good. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here. I wasn't blown away by the food and thought it was a bit pricey for Ethiopian food.

The restaurant was bright, spacious and clean. The server was kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Couldn't leave Toronto without checking out the Ethiopian neighborhood restaurant. The city has a surprisingly sizeable community of Habesha (Ethiopians/ Eritreans). 

If you are new to Ethiopian food, go with the staples that most people enjoy: siga tibs (cubed beef, onions, tomatoes, peppers, chilli peppers, and array of fragrant spices sauted together) and the vegetarian combination (an array of lentils, cabbages, chickpeas, stews that pack in such bold flavors you forget the meat is lacking). Make sure to specifically ask for the tibs to be \"juicy\". They will know exactly what you're talking about, and it will taste better that way. Believe me. I'm Ethiopian and I grew up on this deliciousness. 

And if you're an experienced Ethiopian food connoisseur, then go outside of your comfort zone and try the kitfo (tere- raw or lebleb- sauted lightly). The raw version is better--- and seasoned to perfection with Ethiopian spices. Just think of it as how you would eat a rare cooked steak. 

Anyways, back to my experience. I ordered the tibs and vegetarian combo. It was delicious. Generously portioned. So much so that I couldn't finish it all in one sitting. The sweet waitress packed it up for me and double wrapped it in plastic so that the smell wouldn't overtake my taxi or hotel room.

Overall, the food was comparable to what you can get in most major cities. a solid four stars! Also their hours are much more extended than other Ethiopian restaurants in the are (which usually only open for dinner instead of lunch). I will note that the chickpeas and lentils in the vegetarian combo could have been cooked a little bit longer. But other than that, everything else was fantastic! Will be coming back soon.

P.s. End your meal with \"shai\" (Ethopian tea) with \"kemem\" (cinnamon, cardamom, clove spices). It will not only warm you up from the Canadian cold, but also help you digest the food which is amazing but often very heavy."}
{"text":"Went here with one of my bridesmaids for a Christmas dinner for 2017. I love Ethiopian food and she has never tried it. I looked up this place and seems like they had a fairly good reputation in Toronto for delivering authentic Ethiopian food.

Let's face it. Trying to convince someone who is not very experimental with their food to try Ethiopian food was so hard. I so glad we came here. My bridesmaid loved the food and so did I. This made our night even better! I honestly couldn't stop eating. It came to the point where my stomach started to hurt, but it was such a sin to let all that food go to waste.

It was also not expensive at all. My friend and I shared a plate that had a variety of meat and vegetarian dishes. The ambiance I'd say was authentic with the colors and art used. If it's your first time visiting an Ethiopian restaurant you must do the coffee ceremony. It's fun and of course delicious.

This is a place you bring your family and friends to introduce them to Ethiopian food. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The food was not enough to make me want to ever visit this establishment again.

I came here on a Monday night after having a mother daughter work out session with my mom and her friends.
The place was pretty busy and there was only ONE waitress. I felt bad for her.
It took over 2 hours to get our food.
It took a really long time to even get water.
People around us were leaving.

Our friends are vegetarian and they messed up our order and put the vegetarian and meat dishes together and when we informed the waitress we needed another one, they were vegetarian, she tried to tell them to eat it because it wasnt touching the meat, which they flat out refused, but she still tried to get them to eat it.
This is after waiting an hour for our food.
No apology, no compensation.
They had to wait another 10 minutes to get theirs.
We had a groupon and with their mistake (we were still charged for ours, the mistake they made, and the dish to correct it), it came to $90 (plus whatever we paid for the  groupon).
For four people.

It was the first time I've tried Ethiopian food.
The food was okay, not something I have craved since, so I know I wasn't the biggest fan of it.

The best thing here was the coffee. It takes about 20 minutes to make (that means you'll get it after 2 hours and 10 minutes), but it was honestly the best coffee I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Lalibela is my go-to Ethiopian in Toronto and not just because they have a Groupon Now! coupon available on a daily basis. I would pay full price but I'm on a budget so if I get can twice the Ethiopian in my life for the same price, why would I not?

The decor leaves something to be desired and the service can be slow. 

I love the food and I always get the veggie platter. DELICIOUS. I bring friends here all the time; one platter is great for 3 people. I've never been disappointed by the food.

Bonus points: the first time I came here, I brought a friend who is extremely allergic to incense. We called ahead to ensure they wouldn't use it in the time of day we were coming. Someone at another table ordered the traditional coffee, required incense, and the server let us know and held off the coffee until we were out of the restaurant. Very considerate!

If you're taking someone out to impress them with a fancy restaurant or spot-on service, you're better off going downtown. But for reliable, affordable, delicious, unpretentious eats, hit up Ossington!"}
{"text":"Everything good you could possibly want in refined and exquisitely prepared food is RIGHT HERE at Lalibela.  None of this thrown together nonsense - this is food which is prepared with care.

Had the vegetarian platter ... with injera ... and had the coffee with a presentation of incense.  What a lovely place.  Nice owners/staff - low key environment.  I love, love to spend time at a restaurant which reminds me of growing up on the Continent.

Thank you, Lalibela!"}
{"text":"While i'm a fan of Nazareth just down the street, I really appreciate the number of items on the menu here and the comfy interior. 

I guess I've just always believed how good Nazareth is, that I've never given this place a try. I'm glad i did, because i'll be coming here from now on. 

The food is excellent here and the quantities are generous. 
What you can expect here is to be a bit undeserved, but hey, name me one Ethiopian restaurant in the city that has good service and enough servers working."}
{"text":"This is my go to Ethiopian place. I've been to plenty of other Ethiopian places but I prefer this place. I always have the veg platter and I love it. I can't comment on the meat dishes. 

You can not go wrong with the vegetarian platter for two (if you have two people). Love it!"}
{"text":"My 3rd time eating Ethiopian food down town... it was fabulous and the service was fast.
Vegetarian plate to myself was more than ample
Expect to eat with your hands"}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday, early evening, for a date night with my partner. The food is typically authentic and full of flavour. We ordered the vegetarian platter for two with a side of meat (tibs). 

A few bites in, I noticed a cockroach ON our table. 

I really, really tried not to overreact. I went to the washroom and asked that my partner kill it while I'm gone, although he couldn't find it. Disgusted, I didn't want to ruin our date, so I tried to be resilient. The roach made two other appearances, at which point we both decided our dinner was over. 

I went to pay the bill at the bar in order to expedite our exit, and when I told our waitress that there was a roach on the table, response was, verbatim, \"oh.. okay. sorry then\". I can only infer by her lack of reaction that she has seen or received several complaints about roaches in the establishment. I was too flustered and caught off guard, so I paid the  bill in full. The reality is, we ate less than half of our dinner and the wine was mostly untouched. We left because of a rodent ON THE TABLE. I shouldn't have paid ($70), but didn't want to cause any issues; I really just wanted to leave that place.

In summary, there was a COCKROACH on the DINNER TABLE, and the server was completely unfazed. 

I do not believe they will pass their next health inspection, quite frankly."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating Ethiopian. We had the platter for 2 that had both the vegetarian and meat sides. The portions are huge and the sides were generally tasty but as one reviewer has also pointed out, they also tasted much the same. I'm a fan of the injera though, soft, fluffy and slightly sour (like rye)."}
{"text":"Had a groupon. Server just walked away with phone with group on code for several minutes  Food was alright. Service was slow. Waited here for more than thirty minutes for bill. Bill arrived. Did not deduct groupon amount. Server appears to have also messed up another table's bill."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Ethiopian restaurants, usually ordering veggie platters. Lalibela may be the least phenomenal of them all. 

I liked the decor and the waitress was friendly. We ordered a 3 person vegetarian platter with gluten free injera.

The sides were good, but I would not say there was any particular side that stood out more than another. They all tasted quite similar, and was also not as flavourful as veggie platters from other restaurants. In other words, nothing about the veggie platter makes me want to come back for more. In addition, their spinach side was very raw...almost like eating grass.

I found the gluten free injera to be too fragile, in that as I rip a small piece to get ahold of some sides, the injera starts to break/tear apart, resulting in a very messy meal. Nonetheless, the flavour of the injera was good.

Overall, Lalibela's veggie platter is decent, but its high price point (3 person platter + gluten free injera was approx $40) and lack of flavour is not worth it enough for me to return."}
{"text":"I've recently grown to like Ethiopian food thanks to restaurants like Lalibela and African Palace. The vegetarian platter for 2 at Lalibela is filling and delicious. I still struggle with the whole \"eat with your hands\" thing when it comes to stuffing my little piece of injera bread with veggies, but I'm slowly getting there :)

I honestly cannot say anything bad about this place. The food is amazing, tasty and more importantly - healthy. Especially, if you get the gluten-free (or teff) injera.

What I found surprising was that on a weekday like today (Wednesday), the place was full yet they only had one server working the entire floor. That's unacceptable for a restaurant with so many tables. As a result, you have to wait for your turn and people need stuff all the time (e.g. replace a drink, bring a napkin, bring this or that...). You can't serve so many tables with just one person. I would not be surprised if some customers got disappointed at long wait times.

Having said that, when it comes to taste and food itself, you can't go wrong with Lalibela. I'm saying this, while several years ago I would not even consider going to an Ethiopian restaurant. I had my preconceived notions about it and avoided Ethiopian food like some kind of weird food not in line with my taste buds. Now, I love it. I hope you will like it too. :)"}
{"text":"Two words: coffee ceremony! 
This is enough reason to visit Lalibela. In fact, it will likely be the reason I return. I won't ruin it by describing it too much, but suffice it to say this will be some of the strongest coffee you've experienced! 

The menu boasts well over 50 items that vary quite vastly in terms of spiciness, quantity, and familiarity. Ye beg tibbs seems to be a popular items, though the better option would probably be opting for a few platters that can be shared around. One slightly annoying experience was finding a good amount of bones in the lamb meat which was difficult to detect since the food is consumed by hand. Otherwise, the portions were large and our group definitely enjoyed the meal. The restaurant is a bit understaffed but the person serving us worked hard to make sure we were accommodated. 

Overall, this will become a surprising fav coffee joint with a rather large snacks menu for future visits!"}
{"text":"We came as a party of 2 with a Groupon voucher ($30 for $15) and ordered a mixed platter with a sizzling plate of beef (as recommended by our server). Volume wise, we couldn't finish; great value in this regard. The sizzling beef had a nice texture that can be likened to the charred bits of shawarma chicken that have been roasting on the spit for some time (I don't know I have a thing for bits of meat bordering on charred/crunchy but not chewy). However, overall we found the food over seasoned. Granted I have no frame of reference for authenticity, I found all the spices/fragrance muddled in a very dominant saltiness with each part of the platter reduced to different shades of salty. Service was alright and the place is pretty comfy. I didn't understand why the server was walking around the table with a small pot of burning coffee beans---for a good five minutes, the charred coffee was all I could smell. All in all, a rather average experience."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on a weekend evening.

6:15 - sat down.
6:20 - placed our order.
7:00 - finally offered us water.
7:10 - 2 tables that came at least 20mins after us got their food.
7:25 - we finally got our food after asking the waitress (who didn't seem to care about our concerns). Quality of the food was actually decent for the price but definitely didn't warrant the wait. Service was horrible! The waitresses were rude, lacked a sense of urgency even though a big line-up was beginning to form, and looked like they were being forced to work there against their will. A one point, we asked for another order of Injera and the waitress literally \"flopped\" it into a plate that I was clearly using to eat and walked away.
8:02 - we asked for the bill and told them we had Groupons as well. 
8:25 - the waitress finally came back as asked us to write down the Groupon numbers for her. 
8:35 - she came back and told us she lost the piece of paper that we gave her and asked us to write it again.
8:40 - finally got our remaining balance on a bill. 

This was by far one of my worst restaurant experiences. I highly discourage anyone from coming here unless you have a fetish for bad service and waiting over an hour for your meals."}
{"text":"It's too bad this place has such a low rating because it doesn't deserve it.

I agree the decor or aesthetic atmosphere is lacking, but the food here is outstanding. I highly recommend the beef and lamb...and I generally hate lamb!

The portions (at least for the meat dishes) are quite large; two people could easily share a dish and get stuffed."}
{"text":"I went there with my family to experience a new taste and try something unusual. Looking back I'd rather skip this experience and would go to my favorite sushi place.

Usually we rate restaurants in 3 categories: design, food and service.

Design:
I liked the interior and ambiance of the restaurant. I rate it 9 of 10.

Food:
I'm not really familiar with an Ethiopian cuisine, so I don't know what to expect and how to compare. I ordered lamb in berbere sauce. The size of the portion was generous, but in my opinion the lamb was overcooked and was too mashy. And it lacked any salad or side dish. It was accompanied only by injera - Ethiopian bread. In general I give to this part 6 of 10.

Service:
Here comes the worst part. We had one the worst services ever. The serving is really SLOW. We had to wait almost an hour just to get our meal. The soup came toghether with a main dish. The family which arrived after us was served before us.  
After finishing the main course we've desperately tried to flag to the waitress to come to us but we were simply ignored. Finally my wife approached by herself the bar to order a cake. After waiting another 15 min she had to remind them again about it. All this time the dirty dishes were piled on our table.

The same story was with getting the bill. The bill had an error in $4 and I've got a lame excuse that the price list was changed yesterday and they didn't print a new menu yet. So for the service I give -1 of 10.

Overall, the restaurant has a good potential, the foood is ok, but service kills all good intentions. Personally, I won't come there anymore unless I hear from someone else that things are different now,"}
{"text":"Large portions. Great friendly staff, always welcoming, but service may not be the best if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"What an incredible experience! The restaraunt is nice and cozy, the staff are very friendly, and the food is incredible. I would recommend the coffee ceremony, it's quite the experience."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Indian food then you should give Ethiopian cuisine a try. They have their variations in their bread, spices, and texture but they are similar. 
I purchased a Groupon for this place and even if there wasn't a discount, the prices were still good.
The service here is superb! The waitress made excellent recommendations based off what I enjoyed in the past. It got a little busy around the time we ordered, but she still managed to check up on us.

My biggest bone to pick with this place is that their injera comes out cold. My friend made the same complaint when I told her I gave this place a try. The food itself was warm and filling. However, it was an unpleasant surprise that the vegetarian dishes were more flavourful than the meat. I've had Ethiopian food before and though this is good, it doesn't constitute as great."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Lalibela. The first
time was years ago with a group of my Indian friends. It was a pretty good experience. 

My family and I went there for my birthday dinner last Friday night. It was very busy so they seated us next door at Lalibela lounge. We are Eritrean so we're obviously very familiar with this food. I've never been so disappointed with service at a restaurant in my life. The young female server only seemed to pay attention to the non-Habesha guests .. serving them first even though we arrived before them, constantly asking them how their meal is and never asking us once. We even ordered a second dish because we weren't full and the server completely forgot! After 30 mins of waiting, I went over to the bar where she was standing and texting and asked if our meal was ready and all she responded was \"oops I forgot\". No apologies or nothing. She slammed the food down on our table and walked away. I've never felt so unwelcomed and uncomfortable at a restaurant before. Pretty ironic as it's my cultural environment... 

The food was good though. That's the only plus."}
{"text":"We visited Lalibela with a Groupon coupon.  We didn't know anything about Ethiopian food, so we were both curious and cautious.  I braced for the worst should the food was bland or weird.  We ordered a meat platter and vegetarian platter.  We were blown away by how tasty the food was.  Some meat/vegi items were just salty; while some were very spicy.  The platters had bits of everything, and all were supposed to be eaten with the flour pancakes that came with them.  We were intrigued by the unique flour pancake; we couldn't make out how it was made.  I suspected that the flour pancake was made in-house; I don't think it is a supermarket staple.  

I will return for more unique experience even without a coupon.  This place is inexpensive enough.

Note that if you crave sugar, this is not a place for you.  Desserts were just store bought cakes.

Note also that you eat with your hands.  I confirmed with a friendly waitress that no one had *ever* requested forks and knifes for dinner here."}
{"text":"Well, I am not an expert, but I know what tastes good.  Yummy yummy in my tummy! We always have take home!   Usually get a sampler platter either vegetable or mixed.   I love Ethiopian food, it is spicy but flavor spicy.  OK, it will make your nose run and make you drink tons of water, but is that a bad thing?  Nope!   We go back all the time."}
{"text":"I'm an Rendavous lover so it's hard to review this Ethiopian restaurant when there is already a best. This although is a good restaurant. No complaints, except their meat dishes are not like a stew which is my preference. Wayyyy too far for my location so I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Our family enjoyed a gluten-free (injera is made of teff), dairy-free, non-spicy meal that is the best Ethiopian food we can remember.  We asked the waitress (owner?) about these constraints, and then ordered beef (barbequed rather than stewed), lamb riblets, fried fish (two, served complete from head to tail) and vegetables.  The round platter with injera, beef cubes and vegetables came to the table first, and the waitress then brought poured the lamb riblets from the hot plate from the oven.  On a Sunday night aroud 6:30pm, we thought that we couldn't get a table in the full restaurant, but some other guests were escorted into a hidden room in the basement.  There's more capacity than we thought.  The service was attentive and friendly.  On the east side (past Greenwood Avenue), street parking isn't hard to find in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great food for affordable price. Massive portions! I can eat  ... A lot! I could not even finish half of my order. Be warned and share your order before ordering additional meals. Overall, delicious food. I ordered a lamb dish (asked for no butter) and my friend order a chicken dish.  Tasted lean and clean. Will definitely go again with other friends."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Ethiopian food and had an all around decent experience at Lalibela Ethiopian! The restaurant is located on Bloor street with seating that is open to the street. This compliments the decor and makes the space feel very open!

We ordered the lalibela platter and a fish soup. The fish soup was pretty bland and not that memorable. The lalibela platter for two came with two servings of each type of stew, which made sharing the platter very easy! The stews all had unique flavours: some nutty, some tomato-ey, some spicy which made the platter enjoyable even though they were mostly too salty.

Might be back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This food almost gave me an orgasm...
I took another of my groupons to this place, and ordered one lamb, and one beef. Everything was just soooo gooood. sigh, even the salad was yummy, and I'm no lover of leafy greens!

It's good to know I've found my go-to restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Spacious, nice ambience, friendly waiter, good food.. plentiful food, i had to carry home a box."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very kind service. Looking forward to going back. I only tried the veg platter so can't speak to meat dishes, but really enjoyed what I ordered."}
{"text":"Food was decent though maybe not the best I've had in the city. Service was not friendly or attentive which is unfortunate. It felt like we were a burden to the server which is terrible for someone working in the service industry. There are other Ethiopian restaurants in the city; it's not that I would never go back but I'd look for another restaurant first. This wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Officially my new favourite Ethiopian... We ordered the veg platter for two with ginger tea... Food was exceptional, service was friendly and attentive and the booths were so comfy and I would have stayed longer and tried the coffee but had somewhere to get to... I will definitely be back soon! Thanks for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"I was really happy with the variety of dishes and overall flavor of the vegetarian platter we had.  Unfortunately, none of the food was warm, and the teff bread was stone cold. I didn't see much staff either, and the couple seated behind us had to call a waitress several times before catching anyone's attention."}
{"text":"Food is o.k.

At least they're open at lunchtime, unlike a few other Bloor-based Ethiopian restaurants (ex: Nazareth, African Palace).  My order took 10-15 min. in advance to prepare.  

I've only ever ordered a veggie platter from them.  I've had the platter elsewhere; usually it comes with a small portion of salad in the middle.  Not here.  Which is fine, but I only come here every few months so I think that I'll be surprised each time I don't see a salad included.

There is technically some street parking, especially if you're lucky.  

Today was prob. an off day.  I've been here before and have never had issues (apart from walking here with my furry friend, and his steady barking since there was an odd character/drunk? drugged? near him.  The preordered Take Out food seriously didn't arrive fast enough that day).  
The person working there today didn't speak especially loudly or clearly, so I don't know what she mumbled as she left for the kitchen.  I was finishing up my credit card payment when she left.  My mind was preoccupied by the fact that I parked in a dumb spot and knew it.  Figured because I didn't hear what she said, that it wasn't a big deal and so I grabbed the order that was visible and left.

Got home, hungry!  Aimed for the food.  Happily so.  Saw that there wasn't any cutlery included.  Guessed that was maybe what the person was saying, after all.

No.  Actually, it was a meat-based dish.  I called, and spoke with the person.  She said the only thing that could be done at this point, is an exchange - the wrong item for my item.

Things worked out, afterwards.  
I admit to being preoccupied, but from her end, speaking more loudly and directly to me would have gotten my attention.  I was at the tailend of my transaction, and knew that she said -something-, but her voice was low in tone and I really had no idea what she said.  I was told that this has happened before.  Not often, I'd assume.  We both apologized to each other in the end, and that was the end of today's confusing visit."}
{"text":"I had been looking to try out some Ethiopian food for quite some time and since there wasn't such a restaurant in Halifax any more, I made my way to Toronto to get my fill. A friend of mine lives near by Lalibela and had heard it was really good so we made our way out into the blistery cold and I was NOT disappointed. For it being my first time trying such a dish, I had no idea what to order or even how to eat it really but I caught on really quickly. The server was very friendly and gave us some suggestions and we decided on Vegetarian Platter and the Dero Tibbs. My friend was a bit nervous the chicken would be too spicy but for me it was just right! When we first received our meal, we were a little worried that it wouldn't be enough but after eating a little under half of what we ordered, both of us were stuffed. 

After this visit I was super excited and wanted to eat it again so while I was in Ottawa, another friend and I went out to a local restaurant and I have to admit, it really couldn't compare. Next time I'm in Toronto, I'll be sure to include Lalibela on my list of must eats once again."}
{"text":"We love it here. The veggie platter and beef tibbs are great. But my favorite dish is shirowat. I've been to many ethiopian restaurants and have enjoyed many meals. I like the consistency of this place. I've found my issue with the other places has been that the food is inconsistent. Even though I've enjoyed my food at Lalibela more on certain days than others, it's never a huge discrepancy.  The service is slow but also very friendly and accommodating.  I don't mind waiting for good food."}
{"text":"I have to say, on a cold rainy day nothing warms you up like Ethiopian food! I had never been to Lalibela before but it held up to all previous experiences of Ethiopian food. I ordered the vegetarian platter and I am not sure what all the different food was on the platter but they were all delicious. The waitress wasn't really around to answer questions so we just went with the combo. The injera is great and they give you more than enough. This place was packed and we were there on a saturday around 3 so that is a good sign i guess!"}
{"text":"I came here with a Groupon deal - $15 for $30 food. The platter we ordered was tasty and the portions HUGE (three of us couldn't finish the plate for two!), but the service was VERY slow. I wouldn't come here if you're hoping for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I came here with my bf and another couple. It was our first time trying Ethiopian food so we were really excited. We got a meat platter and added a few other meat dishes for them to throw on.

Everything was delicious and there was a ton of veggie stuff too but the meat portions were pretty small. That spongey bread was AMAZING though!!! 

We ordered coffee to end the meal with and we're excited to experience the coffee ceremony. About 10 minutes after we ordered we asked when it would be coming. The waitress then came by with this burning stick thing that smelt like burnt coffee, interesting. After a few more times of asking our coffee finally cake like 20 minutes later. We hardly even wanted it anymore at this point. I'm not sure if this is typical that the coffee takes so long to set up but if that's the case they should give a heads up. There were also only 2 girls working and they were pretty busy.

Guess we'll have to try another Ethiopian restaurant on danforth east where they all seem to be!"}
{"text":"Food was good and decent proportion. I was here with a friend on a weekday evening, with a Groupon. The Groupon was 14 for the worth of 30, which was a good deal. Service though, wasn't the best. It was pretty slow and we asked for the bill multiple times, and waited for a long time."}
