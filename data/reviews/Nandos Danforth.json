{"text":"The S L O W E S T dining experience I've ever had. 

Dine in food took OVER 1 HOUR to arrive at our table (I checked against the order reicept) 

Seems the kitchen and staff prioritize take out and door dash orders over dining room customers. The entire seating area was waiting for food while we watched packages of food be packed into bags for take out. 

The chicken itself is alright. Dark meat quite moist and the variety of sauces are nice. 

The Portuguese tart was far too sweet. 

Ask for the tarts on display in the front. The cashier tried to give me one from the back which was a bit burnt. 

Not coming back."}
{"text":"Don't even bother calling to place an order, you'll be put on hold for 10 minutes. I would tell you I should have expected the wait cause it was lunch time or dinner time but I called at 4. I called back, only to be hold for another 10 minutes. 
Can't even write a review to say if the food was good  when we couldn't even place an order"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and ordered take out. The order got completely messed up and I spent $75 on about $20 worth of food. 
I wanted sangria while I waited
Not available...
Chicken was marginal at best and the sides were so small my pet rabbit would have remained hungry.
Swiss chalet chicken is far superior and the whole experience was challenging at best. Never going back."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch last Saturday when they first opened. No one there yet, we were seated with menus, and then told the ordering process. They had about 5 kids standing around, I guess they are table runners.  Train them to be waiters, I'm too old for this crap.  Just give us a waiter.  

So I go an order and the girl asks me \"what's ur table #.  How the hell should I know, I don't work there ? 

Then we are instructed about the self serve sauces and drinks. Ugg !! 

Food is passable, over priced.  We had 1/2 chicken with a small side of coleslaw and 6 wings. All MEH $45 

If u want Portuguese food go to the west end.  U will get value & taste for your $$.  And also get a real dining experience.  

Nice Reno though."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service today. Nothing left but the bones .. So good. We had the double leg with fries hot  and the half chicken regular for the kids . reasonable for all that came"}
{"text":"My take away experience was faaaar better than dining in. Service at take away was super fast, no mess up with the order. This branch is a new one so they're working hard through the initial hiccups which I appreciate. I have to say... Nandos is a great addition to the neighbourhood and very family friendly and I look forward to going back with my family soon"}
{"text":"Didn't realize that Nando's has been in Canada since the early 90s ....
Dropped by for lunch at around 1:30, place wasn't crowded, found a sit in minutes. Had the chicken skewers with spice rice. Both were brilliant. Wouldn't hesitate going back."}
{"text":"My first time trying Portuguese Chicken and I loved it! The place is open and inviting. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and most important... The food is AMAZINGLY GOOD! 
We went for the variety Platter, medium spicy. The chicken was really tasty and the spice was on the spot! Skewers are a must! And rice! Try the spiced rice!! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the quinoa salad for delivery and I got raw butternut squash !! Who eats raw squash I've ordered this item many times in the past and the squash has always been cooked sorry Nando's you just lost a very good customer"}
{"text":"I have been to Nandos a few times since they recently opened on the Danforth. I think it is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. The staff are all really wonderful and trying very hard as they learn how to manage how busy is has been in this new location! The food is fantastic. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Didn't bother to tell us until after we ordered and paid that it would be half an hour wait for my take out. That would have been useful information before we paid. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm generally a huge fan of Nandos but I do not recommend this location. The chicken was dry and the fries were stale. Such a disappointment. 

If you are craving some chicken, head to the Bay Street location. The food there is consistently better. The wait is longer but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I have missed having a Nandos close by for years.  I loved their commercials on TV in South Africa.
Today was the opening day.  The franchisee was on site nervously supervising everything.  A very friendly fellow.
The food was as good as I remembered.  The hot sauced chicken I chose was perfect.
I was amused that the person I ordered from cautioned me as I ordered it.  I just told them I had been ordering the hot sauce for decades.
I will be going frequently.  I think that this store will cancel my ordering out for Swiss Chalet even if I have to pick it up!
A very good start."}
{"text":"Doesn't even rate one star! After waiting an hour (for fast food chicken - c'mon) we got a table for six. We were motivated to try Peri Peri so we stayed. Paying before you get your food, serving yourself drinks , appetizers and authorizing a tip BEFORE service is quaint but no big deal. After another hour of waiting I corralled a busy employee to check on our order. She said that they were short staffed and ran out of chicken. No one came to the table with news of our order. Fifteen minutes later I went to the cash and asked for a manager. None came. Food finally arrived. To add insult to injury, my chicken was bloody. Manager finally came after I sent it back an said all chicken is pre-cooked and it must have been a vein. Absolutely unacceptable! She offered coupons (to come back? I don't think so). Stay away."}
{"text":"Lots of terrible reviews here.  I can see why.

Things started out well enough.  Friendly staff.  We placed our order and waited for lunch to arrive.  And the kitchen prepared the meal in a reasonable time.  They put the plates under the heat lamps and yelled out that an order was ready.  And there our meals sat.  And sat.  And sat.  For about 15 minutes.  All they needed to do was bring the plates less than 20 feet over to our table.  The woman who finally brought the plates over was fairly surly.  And the heat lamps can't be that great because the French fries were cold.  I later complained and the server told me \"Oh, it wasn't 15 minutes.\"  Wow.  Crap service *and* attitude.  I didn't bother mentioning that some guy who came in nearly 20 minutes after we did got his meal first.  What would have been the point?  The food was actually pretty good, but the service was so terrible that I can't in good conscience rate any higher than one star.  My first visit to this location.  And my last."}
{"text":"Thrilled when Nandos opened in the neighbourhood. The chicken is excellent. We do take out and the wait is usually only 15min. Dining in takes longer. The Nandos rice, garlic mashed potatoes and veggies are the best sides. The fries are just ok, and the spicy powder doesn't really help. The sauces are excellent."}
{"text":"Came here on April fool's day. They were given away free Peri Peri chicken. Wasn't a big lineup as I thought would be and got seated within a few minutes. They even gave a small bottle of hot sauce and nuts to try while we waited. 

Food came out fast. The chicken was good. Definitely better than Swiss Chalet and they had a variety of different sauces we could try. The fries were nicely spiced and yummy as well. 

The service was attentive, and the staff friendly even though was kinda busy in there."}
{"text":"Sorry Nando, I'm not really impressed. 

My boyfriend always like to praise about how good their chicken is in Europe, when we walked by this location we decided to give it a try, first time ever in Canada.

Truth is, it ain't so great. 2.5/5

My biggest complain is the portion size. For a 1/4 leg combo with 1 size is more than $10 before tax. When the food arrived to our table, it looks like a kids meal. Taste wise, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. Also DO NOT get vegetables as a side, it's just onions and pepper with a lot minced garlic, do not taste good. My boyfriend got a chicken wrap, was very mediocre. 

$30 spent for 2 so-called combos, we both left hungry."}
{"text":"Have seen multiple Nando sites popping up around town and finally got the chance to try it out. We compared the costs and decided to share the whole chicken ($18.55), side of peri peri wedges ($3.90), side of hearty coleslaw ($3.90) and unlimited fountain pop. Price-wise it's on the more expensive side of fast food but reasonable if compared to restaurant prices.

The chicken was very moist, well seasoned and just enough for two people. I appreciate that they cook it when you order. The sides were good, but nothing stood out about them. I would say my favorite part was trying all the sauces available for you to bring back to your table. Mixing and matching the flavors made each bite interesting."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Food was delicious. Had the chicken pita (medium spice) with halloumi, garlic mashed potatoes and Caesar salad. Super friendly and helpful service staff made it feel like a genuine restaurant experience. Happy to have this new addition to the neighbourhood. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Gonna start off saying: Love Nando's. Went over here instead of going to my usual Bay location. I've been excited for their open for quite some time because it was much closer to my southern place of residence in Scarborough. Love the very convenient location right near Pape station. I went after work with a co-worker and we arrived and ordered around 6:10. We ordered the \"Full Pack\" meal between the two of us (we were starving!) with the coleslaw and garlic mashed potato and two cokes.

Reception was great! It was extremely clean (probably because it opened about two weeks ago). The atmosphere isn't anywhere near the Bay street location. It seemed to have more of a fast food/cafeteria vibe because everything was so much smaller. The tables are tiny, the venue is a little cramped, and there are very few comfortable group seats. I found it really strange for a Nando's because we usually come in groups of 4+.

Nando's is known for its self-sufficient serving. We received our cups for drinks on order at the counter, and our garlic bread came to our table shortly after. Bread was great! We forgot it serves 3-4 people so we were surprised at the sheer amount. We picked up our sauces and my co-worker drenched the bread with the salad dressing and garlic sauce (highly recommended, delicious).

Because the table was so full with plates with only the garlic bread, we requested to be moved to a booth. It couldn't happen right away, but after what happened next, they made an exception.

We expected the chicken. The people beside us left. A few others were complaining. We long since finished our massive pile of bread. We switched seats and after about an hour fifteen, I see it being delivered to our old table. I scooted over there and informed a waiter that it was, in fact, ours and I wasn't stealing someone else's food. After brushing the wait and awkwardness off, we chowed down. After getting through the first breast, we flipped the legs over to realize it was burned pretty significantly. In retrospect, the sides seemed like they were not in their \"Nando's sized\" dishes either. Luckily, the potatoes and the coleslaw were regular Nando's fare. The first piece of chicken for each of us was passable, albeit a little overcooked. 

I flagged down someone wearing a blue shirt (the blue shirts looked like management, they had been fluttering around tables) and told them it was an extremely bad experience. They were completely understanding and zipped away with our receipt to refund it. It was a relief as it seemed rectified, but we sat at the table for another 25 minutes before we got up and said we had to leave. Thankfully the lady we were speaking to was very sweet and offered us complimentary meals without us asking for them, along with our refund.  We left at about 8:15pm.

Admittedly, it could have been so much worse if the management didn't completely agree it was bad service. This is why I'm rating 2 stars. Apparently they had a catering issue where the kitchen was pressed and couldn't finish orders in time. Based on this experience, I'd only go on a Tuesday afternoon until kitchen management, floor attentiveness, and customer service gets better. 

I know self-sufficiency is the key to Nando's service, but no one informed us of the wait for chicken. It seemed like a truly bad day for the staff. They all seemed super stressed to the point of pity. They're lucky they're a Nando's, otherwise this kind of service in their first month would tank them. I feel it would've been a better experience if they had not been under so much stress.

I truly hope it gets better in there! I'm gladly open to re-rating and giving them 5 stars. That new-restaurant curve's gotta stop somewhere."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to this location. The first visit was for a 1/4 chicken and two sides and the Second was for the 1/2 chicken with a Nando sized side. Today I had the chicken sandwich and a Nando sized salad. 

I have to say the chicken is fantastic. It's always super tender and juicy. They ask you your spice level and I have always gotten medium as I can grab extra hot sauce at the back. 

My only gripe is the size of the sides. They are fairly small. Even my Nando sized Caesar salad seemed a tad on the small side. 

If they can up the side size this place would be perfect. After my sandwich and salad I am still hungry. 

Up the size of the sides and I will up the stars!"}
{"text":"Love Nandos! Was a little hesitant on trying this location due to the negative reviews. However, the place is great, food was delicious (just like other locations), really nice seating and decor inside, had no issues with staff, food came out pretty fast. Noticed there were a lot of families with kids...awesome! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Nandos. I got the Peri Peri Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. It was kind of an odd concept ordering upfront as soon as you walk in at the counter, but wasn't a dealbreaker. They have an area where you can get your drink(free refill)sauces, and cutlery. 
Overall I enjoyed Nandos and this location."}
{"text":"My main gripe is that even their plain-ish (as they call it) chicken, is too spicy (hot). We have a 3 1/2 year old and it was burning his mouth so bad he couldn't eat it. To be honest, it was burning my mouth too. I guess that is what Peri Peri is about, so ultimately it's not for me."}
{"text":"Fancy a cheeky Nando's with a pint or a cuppa, mate? Or maybe the Coke Freestyle Machine, choose from Coke or Diet Coke, Powerade, Minute Maid Lemonade or Dasani. Now choose your fruit flavour & will that be caffeine free. Oh yeah. Pop is bottomless for $2.75. Now the peri-peri chicken plate: Daughter and I chose a medium sauce variety share plate, well worth it at $29.75. OMG! 2 succulent chicken skewers nicely spiced, we each had one and I shared a bite of mine cause it was so good, with hubby, 1/2 chicken with the medium peri-peri sauce, plus 5 wings. 

It comes with 2 sides. We chose to share the Casa Salad & garlic mashed potatoes. The salad dressings are Creamy or Balsamic Vinegarette, Olive Oil or Classic bottles at the cutlery counter, help yourself. The little salad was exceptionally fresh, good quality cucumbers (daughter scarfed them ALL but said apologetically that they were VERY good!) cherry tomatoes, (they popped in my mouth, so fresh!) and crunchy romaine lettuce. The garlic mashed redskin potatoes were really well spiced. 

What I'm trying to say is that although you might want to grate some fresh pepper onto your meal, particularly the salad or chicken breast, you really don't miss using the salt around here. If you do want salt though, it's cunningly hidden in a little wooden egg shaker (yes, it's an egg) right next to the little Portuguese rooster who has your table number and who will hold his place until the waitress has brought over your hot meal.

Daughter scarfed the leg WAAAH! But with the extra Peri Peri sauce bottle, even the dryer white meat was quite good. If you are not sure of how spicy the peri peri sauce will be but feel brave, follow my plan: order the medium sauce on your chicken but pick up the Hot or Extra Hot Nando's peri-peri sauce bottle to shake onto your food from their serving counter, where the cutlery (real metal cutlery, none of that plastic crap) and Coke Freestyle Machine is located (this will the first time using that machine with Real Glass Tumblers!).

Lotsa dessert choices too but we went for the bottomless yogurt, which may be chocolate, vanilla or strawberry depending on what day you come in a  little cup you refill yourself at the yogurt machine. It's very similar to a Wendy's Frosty, except that like everything else it's NOT served in paper or plastic but on nice matching oven to table ware. This is the first restaurant I ever was tempted to take a photo of their DISHES, so I did!

Lastly, the ambience and the music: the ambience is red brickwork and comfortably designed chairs and rounded booths and regular booths, nice window looking onto THE Danforth. Music, a little different from what you've heard lately, Angolan from South Africa & Portuguese music. It was nice and added to the atmosphere.

Washrooms brand new, spotless and very spacious. Service, although Nando's is partially self service, for your drinks, cutlery & straws, and you order your chicken, sides & dessert, and receive your GLASS drinking glasses at the front counter, three waitresses asked if we'd been attended to while the first one was cleaning off the window facing table I'd requested was clearing it off. Two checked how we were doing and if we needed anything. Nando's hasn't missed a trick, Yelpers. Perfect on all counts, and this is Ms. Nitpicker speaking LOL!

Oh, Swiss Chalet, you are in DEEP TROUBLE if I am any judge, if this Nando's chain gets up and running in Toronto! Not even your own peri peri sauce will help!"}
{"text":"I had the most disturbing experience here unfortunately and will never, ever visit a Nando's again. This location has the  most unprofessional, disgruntled and downright terrible employees I've ever had to deal with. The managers do not care about service whatsoever and I'm surprised this place even has 3 stars. 

Sophia the \"manager\" is the antithesis to what a supervisor is supposed to be -- she screamed in my face when I simply asked her where our food was as we waited TWENTY minutes staring at our food sitting on the hot line.  She then went on to lie and literally scream in my face saying she was the only manager available to speak to when I asked to speak to a manager, but within a minute went in the back to get the real manager when my husband continued to ask to speak to one. 

I tried speaking to Kristen who is the location manager and she clearly wasn't interested in listening to me and didn't care about her out of control employee's behavior. 

With people with such bad attitudes running the place I wouldn't be surprised if this restaurant closes down."}
{"text":"Terrible takeout service. I wasn't acknowledged and waited a long time. The cashier kept telling me my total as if I was finished after ordering each item. As a result I didn't get to order everything I wanted. I was handed an empty cup for my drink but was not told where to fill it. I had to walk all the way to the back of the restaurant while being cut off by staff in the aisles in order to fill the cup. No ice. Then I was made to sit on a horribly uncomfortable chair while waiting for my food.

I got home and a 1/4 chicken was just a leg and the wedge fries were smaller than a small fries at McDonald's. I basically had to give my meal to my son in order for him to have enough to east."}
