{"text":"Mediocre for the price.  My $13 calzone was doughy, slightly under cooked and my $7 side salad (Frankie's House Salad) was a disgrace.  The lettuce was slimy, floppy and extremely wilted.  Seriously, for a $7 side salad, i at least expect lettuce that was at least bought THIS week!!!

Not to mention, can someone please give Frankies the memo that putting only lettuce in a bowl and calling it a salad, then charging $7 for it, is misleading , half a$$ed and very disappointing.  Literally, $7 for a bowl of wilted lettuce, no other toppings, it was $1.50 extra to even add cheese.  Gimme a break."}
{"text":"Frankie's is a place that without a doubt, will be coming back to. When I went, I ordered the Chicken Marsala and the marsala wine sauce does give the plate a brighter flavor profile. The House Salad was fresh and the Italian dressing allowed the flavor to widen. The portions was reasonably sized, but the main drawback is that it is a little expensive. If you can get past that, it is much more worthwhile than one of the chains in the area."}
{"text":"Potentially the worst pizza I have ever had.  Served cold and tasteless.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I remember my nephew and his fiancee talking about the good food they had at Frankie's, so I decided to buy a recent Groupon so my family and I could try it.  We had a pleasant experience!  At first, I thought the prices were a little on the steep side, until I saw the huge portions of rigatoni we got - wow!  It was nice to have leftovers!  The rigatoni was very tasty, the bread was delicious, the lemonade tasted homemade and the salad was fine, but I like cheese on mine.   We were pleased to have great meals and great service, as well.  We will be back!  :-)"}
{"text":"I love small local joints such as this one, but their disorganized staff leaves something to be desired. We were told that it would be a 15 minute wait, and my wife and I ended up waiting a whole hour. (The most frustrating part, was watching 4 booths that were empty for over 10 minutes.)

Anyways, food... based on others' suggestions - I went with the House salad. Unless you're getting it as a meal, don't. It's enormous, and I swear there is over a pound of cheese. Overall it was too sweet.

Fried ravioli was delicious. HOWEVER, it's $7 and you get SEVEN raviolis.  

Entree - Parmesan Penne, the pasta was way overdone. Oh well.

Went with a Groupon, I'd recommend doing the same or else forgetting this place."}
{"text":"Tuesday nights for half of pizzas! LOVEEEE this place. The house salad the the dressing with all that cheese so yummy! Hot and spicy pizza is my favorite. Its a great spot for a date night. Right by Great Northern Mall-so a nice spot to go to after hitting the mall."}
{"text":"Wife and I used our Groupon here Wednesday night. I've eaten their pizza before and it was pretty good so we decided to try an entree. My partner chose the chicken marsala and I tried the chicken pompador. The salad was boring with the typical iceberg and hard tomatoes combo.  My pasta was al dente and the flavors were good with lots of garlic.  The Marsala was very disappointing with a serious lack of mushrooms on the plate, small amount of chicken and was somewhat flavorless.  My biggest complaint was the pricing for the entrees, $16 dollars is a little inflated for this quality of food, $11-$12 maybe. Decor is in serious need of an upgrade also.  I might eat here again but only on a Tuesday when they run app and drink specials but I won't go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Listen, I take people to lunch/dinner almost every day for my job and I have eaten at virtually every restaurant in the greater Cleveland area, not to mention I'm Italian, and I can say with 100% certainty that this is the worst Italian food I have ever eaten. We actually considered asking for our money back. All six of us agreed that the food was beyond terrible. The good reviews on here absolutely baffle me. Some of these people must have never eaten at another Italian restaurant in their life. I could go on and on, but I won't. TRUST ME on this one and do not eat here unless you enjoy wasting your money."}
{"text":"It was me and my wife's first time going here. we found out about this place on the yelp app. It kinda fools you at first because of the plain building appearance. I can't count how many times if passed this place up just because it doesn't even look like a restaurant. We were greeted immediately and had a very short waiting time (even on there busy time during the week, famliy night) the service was great and the food was better. I had there chicken tosca. And my wife had the spaghetti and meatballs. Really good Italian. Kinda pricy though. 2 people bill was right $38 and some change. And that's not including the tip..."}
{"text":"A classic family-owned Italian restaurant for at least half a century. Service was excellent and the ambiance included what I think was Italian music (I don't speak Italian so who knows?). The food was also very good with pizza as their specialty. On Tuesdays they have a half off pizza deal which I think would be very worth your while to try.

I ordered a large buffalo chicken pizza and a large white pizza with added shrimp. Both pizzas were very good though the crust was nothing to write home about. Unfortunately, I think they would really benefit from a chef inspired butter or dip because the complementary bread only featured the little packaged butter. I also ordered the chicken Tosca which featured a lemon garlic chicken grilled in egg whites, delicious. The house salad had a bit too much cheese to my liking, reminding me of how my roommate would describe his delivery pizza order with, \"as much cheese as God would allow.\"

Overall I recommend this restaurant if you enjoy Italian food, especially pizza, and do not mind trying new things. Try the ranch and garlic butter dip. Both seemed to be homemade and would really accentuate the bread or crust. Yummm"}

{"text":"Good solid Italian restaurant. Usually come here when in the area. Not sure why some negative reviews. Been coming here for over 10 years. Have never been disappointed. Service has always been good."}
{"text":"It's good, but a little pricey for a \"let's just go out\" place.  Average Italian and decor, some stuff under $10,  most under $15."}
{"text":"Frankie's, you never disappoint! Haven't lived in Cleveland in more than 30 years but make a point of treating myself to Frankie's one or twice a year when I am \"home\". Grew up on Mastick Rd. and Frankie's was a treat when parents were going out. Still best pizza ever! Thanks Dorothy for taking good care of me!"}
{"text":"We had Kandy as our waitress - she was awesome- and had great suggestions. We shared the lasagna which was tasty and delicious! We also shared their special salad and each had drinks. Our shared meal and all else was very reasonable and all excellent including the service that was timely and attentive.  I discreet with the negative posts. The restaurant was busy and we still were seated quickly and served in great time. I recommend Frankie's and Kandy as a waitress! Don't believe every review you read and try it for yourself"}
{"text":"I ordered pasta with Alfredo sauce and basically received buttered pasta. When I asked the server for a little more sauce, she snapped \"I'll see what I can do \". She came back and informed me that there would be a charge for \"extra\" sauce. I  said it was not extra when there was not even enough. I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery. Simple, pepperoni and mushroom. The delivery took over an hour. The toppings were sparse at best, worst sauce I've had in a long time and it was barely warm. I highly highly recommend if you are in this area order your pizza from a chain and not this place."}
{"text":"I ordered caprice salad that tasted really bed and fried ravioli that were dried on the outside I called them and they wanted me to give them back the food when they took it they said that it been eaten and they can't give refund I told them I tasted it and I've asked to get some kind of credit and he didn't want to we r 8 ppl staying here for 10 days he lost a lot of money for his ego"}
{"text":"Worst experience out to eat. We waited 1.5 hours for a pizza. When it got here it wad cold and extremely mediocre. Avoid at ALL costs."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Frankie's since the 1990s.  It has always been a favorite place of ours.

The atmosphere of the dining room is somewhat dated, but it is quaint and inviting, as well.

The menu is what you would expect from an Italian restaurant.  They serve numerous pasta dishes and Italian favorites.

The best thing about Frankie's is their pizza.  It takes about 20 minutes or so waiting for a pizza in the dinning room, which can seem like a long time - especially if you have kids.  However, the pizza is worth the wait.  It tastes fresh, flavorful, and filling."}
{"text":"Love going here for hometown Italian cooking. Prices are reasonable, and food is excellent."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Great salads.  After having their pizza it's hard to go to the national chain cardboard pizzas.  The pizzas are fresh and taste really good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Frankie's. I want the mom and pop places to succeed, but it still has to be good. Our server was great, very sweet, although she didn't know what some menu items were and had to ask the kitchen. That's about where the good impression stopped. Salad was beyond sad, better off not serving it. I had eggplant parmigiana and it was way to thick, they didn't pull the water out and it was greasy. I really had a hard time eating it. My husband got just spaghetti with meatballs. He is a meatball connoisseur and did not care for these. There's was enough sauce on both our spaghetti's to have leftovers for 2 more bowls of spaghetti. Maybe we just came on an off night, but in my opinion there's a lot room for improvement."}
{"text":"This was an overall good dining experience. I haven't been to Frankies in over 10 years. On my first visit I ordered chicken cacciatore, and I was very unhappy. It had large pieces or raw veg and a tasteless sauce. This visit was a total 360, but still lost a star due to my first visit. 

Last night I had the calamari (up there with some of the best), the house salad (loaded with iceberg, house dressing, which was kinda sweet and mimicked poppy-seed and a huge mound of provolone cheese) and I did the linguine and white clam sauce for my entree (tons of clams, parsley, nice sauce, parmesan cheese). If you are into linguine and clams this is a must try. All of it was good and something I would eat again. 

We also had the pizza which was half price on Tuesday, we did the deluxe. The pizza was so yummy but i didn't eat the crust which seemed a little bland and dry. But who needs crust when you get a huge pizza for $8? Some of the apps were also half price, so my date had 8 breaded wings for $4.

Service was perfect, my raspberry ice tea (yummo) stayed full and ice cold. My server Dean, was very attentive and always showed up at just the right moment. All the patrons were very friendly and I would def be back and recommend this place. 

I was lured in with a $30 groupon for only $15 (although I couldn't redeem that as well as the 1/2 price apps and pizza), I wasn't disappointed. I was happy to have an excuse to come back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Dined in, had the calamari and a pepperoni, mushroom, pie. Really good! The calamari is served with marinara and I could even eat the scary looking ones, they were so good. The pizza was knife and fork definitely, but it seemed to be made with good ingredients and was nice and cheesy, just how I like it.

I'm pretty sure that I ordered delivery from here too. I wanna say we did the chicken parm, which was just ok. A bunch of other stuff too, I remember my bill being like $50. But the leftover pizza and salad the next day def hit the spot. Pretty good place if your into that sort of thing, which I am. If you aren't obsessed with thin crust I bet you'll like it."}
{"text":"Had a lunch meal here recently with a few co-workers.  Had always wanted to give this place a try and finally got around to doing it.  The restaurant has a definite \"old school\" feel once inside; we were quickly seated and made our meal choices.

I chose their \"Taste of Italy\" sampler-style platter that came with a house salad.  After placing our orders, the server brought out a loaf of fresh, warm bread that was really nice...crusty on the outside, soft and pillowy warm on the inside.

The house salad had a sweet-and-sour dressing (I ordered that based on my co-worker's recommendation) and a huge mound of shredded Provolone cheese on the side.  I typically do not like sweet dressings (was hoping it was a bit tangier), but it had a nice flavor that complimented the salad fixings.

The \"Taste of Italy\" dish comes with a trifecta of Italian favorites...lasagna, fettuccine alfredo and chicken parmesan.  Their red sauce was chunky and hearty but on the sweet side (again, not my favorite style). The chicken parmesan cutlet had surprisingly very little sauce on it and was topped with a tomato slice and the cheese melted over the top of it.  The fettuccine alfredo was creamy and not too overpowering.

Pricing was on the (slightly) high side for what it was, and meal preparation took an extremely long time for some reason.  Overall the meal was decent, but nothing really \"wowed\" me."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 30 years. My fiancé and I eat here/ order takeout a solid twice a month. Today they just lost a customer. About a month ago I ordered penne Parmesan to go. It comes with a side salad and a piece of Italian bread. It's a delicious dish with meat sauce and covered in mozzarella cheese. I got it home and all it was was penne pasta with some plain marinara sauce on it, much to my dismay. I called to complain and was told it would be taken care of. We decided to order dinner from there today and I told them about the last time, and that I was owed a meal replacement. They told me the owner noted that the pasta would be replaced, but since there was nothing wrong with the side salad the last time, I would have to pay $3.75 for it. Have you ever heard of something so ridiculous? This guy is so cheap and greedy that he's going to lose a customer of 30 years over an iceberg salad that cost less than a quarter. It's truly shameful that they don't value their customers. They will never get another red cent from me. But I'm sure he doesn't give a shit anyway. He obviously doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself. You should be ashamed of yourself."}
{"text":"I can only attest to the pizza and the house salad. But it is excellent pizza and excellent house salad. Will be a must-visit every time I return to the area."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years.  Unfortunately every year the quality has gone down.  This has been the last year for us to go.  The service is rude, they don't honor their coupons and the food is only mediocre.  The pizza was bland, I ordered garlic on my pizza and it was a little of jarred minced garlic. They use to slice a few cloves and put it on.  They only put a piece of sausage on every OTHER piece of pizza. My friend ordered a chicken dish, she took one bite and made a face.  Her salad was so over flowing with salad dressing you could lay a spoon in the tiny dish and it would be covered, completely."}
{"text":"Had the fish dinner tonight.  Very disappointed. Fish appeared to be frozen filets from a frozen box.   All the filets were uniform in size and shape.  They were also over cooked very mushy inside and oily.   

Fries were the best part of the dinner. They seemed to be fresh cut potato wedges.  

Waiter was very nice also.  Hence two stars for fries and the waiter. 

Therefore stay away from fish dinner."}
{"text":"Great pizza, super cheesy and tasty crust. We ordered delivery and the service was excellent. House dressing is sweet but tasty."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by the staff at our hotel so we tried it.  Two things upon walking in: 1) busy and crowded, and 2) it was really warm inside - as if the A/C was broken.

I always think that a crowded restaurant with a wait means that it's a good restaurant.  Frankie's certainly has a busy pizza business going - pizza boxes were flying everywhere.  We dined in and ordered entrees from their menu, one chicken pomodoro and a peppers and sausage entree.  With that you get a house salad and a loaf of bread with butter.

I was glad to find out that Frankie's makes some of their own dressings, including the Italian which is what I ordered.  The dressing was good, and the salad was a very basic 90% iceberg lettuce salad. The bread was warm but it doesn't look as if it is baked in-house.  It had a pre-packaged taste and feel to it.  

My peppers and sausage entree was good - very flavorful tomato sauce, though somewhat skimpy on the peppers.  Also the sausage was a bit spicier than I expected, no worries though.  My friend's chicken entree was the opposite - very bland.  She had to add lots of cheese to give it flavor.  And isn't pomodoro traditionally made with angel hair pasta?  Her pomodoro was made with ziti.  

Service was fine - I had the feeling our server stays very busy but even so she brought our food quickly and kept our drink glasses full.  I really think they should get larger drink glasses - not anything crazy like 24 ounces but definitely something larger than an 8 ounce glass. The server was experienced and helpful.  

Bonus: when I checked in thru Yelp I was able to get 10% off our food!  That was a welcomed surprise."}
{"text":"I won a gift card to this place some time ago.
Went there today, pizza was really good.
However, I witnessed a situation that was handled poorly and thought I would share.
Elderly couple used a $7 coupon for dine in only for diner menu, they were given dinner menu's, not lunch and when asked to apply the coupon the said it was for lunch only.
Back and forth for 15 mins until the couple got upset and said, fine, paid full and left.
I finished and said to the snot greater up front, \"not intended for you but thought you all handled the poorly\".  Snot said how so, I went to explain my thoughts and she yelled at me while walking away saying I'm not the manager.
Manager never make his way to talk the to couple.
I did hear them all laughing in the kitchen about the episode.  Try treating the elderly with a bit more respect, they earned it and all over $7. Assuming thy will not be back nor I. To bad, damn good za."}
{"text":"Everyone else with me LOVED their meals. So my review is probably not the average. I got spaghetti aoila?, which was much too bland for my taste. A lot of oil, not enough cheese, and meh. Service was VERY slow for us. Took over an hour for what should've been a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I've lived in North Olmsted for three years now and just tried Frankie's this weekend.  I receive coupons and flyers from them all the time but I just don't order out for pizza that often.  Which will probably change now that I've tried this.  

We ordered just a plain cheese and the buffalo chicken pizza.  Both were delicious, hot and perfectly made.  The Buffalo pizza wasn't too spicy but you could definitely taste the flavor.  We picked up the order which was ready exactly when they said it would be.  They accepted our coupon and everyone who I came in contact with was very friendly.  

Can't wait to go back and try the other specialty pizzas!!"}
{"text":"Bleck!! This hidden gem is now very dull. Posted a review on a different site and Frankie's returned back a somewhat unprofessional comment. 

My comment on a different review site: 
\"My husband and I kept hearing how awesome this little gem was in North Olmsted. So we figured we would switch up our places for dinning out and we were let down. The food was blah, not super hot, and I had wished that we would have went to Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill for the amount of money we spent on two dinners and soda. Will not be going back.\" 

Frankie's response: 
\"We are sorry to hear about your unusal dining experience last week. Did you speak to one of our managers during your visit? They would have taken care of any issues you might have needed corrected. I guess not. As you stated, this GEM has been in business for 45 years, and Rewards Network customers have given us their HIGHEST SCORES consistently. YOUR LOSS!!!\"

To me...it is their loss. Their loss of myself and husband as customers. Their loss of others as customers if they continue to issue poor food for too much money and make snarky unprofessional comments. Its a recession fools, the competition is tight for dining dollars. It isn't my responsibility to tell a manager you f'ed up. It is your responsibility to get it right the first time. Guess you didn't learn that lesson in 45 years

If you want decent Italian food, I would strongly encourage you to drive over to Little Italy on the East Side of town and find of their awesome gems!"}
{"text":"I went here with some coworkers for lunch a few weeks back. It's a very simple, almost diner-like restuarant. Nothing fancy, very casual and friendly. 

The food is very much an American Italian menu and it's very affordable. You likely won't be blown away but you will get filled up for a very low price.  Good selection of stuff and there is a lunch special where you get pasta and a salad for a low price (sorry, I forget the actual price!).  They had a surprisingly big dessert selection, too, and we loved everything we got!"}
{"text":"Passable Italian food for the Westside.  They are mostly known for their pizza.  Excellent pizza sauce.  I took a couple of my Filipina friends from Cali there and they seemed to like it a lot.  They ordered the lasagna.  Then again Filipinos eat fish eyeball soup.  Still this place is WAY better than Nino's.  Just say no to Nino's.  Trust me.  Everyone I've dated around here who likes Nino's is unstable.  I'm talking Sisqo from Dru Hill unstable."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Michigan. We were in Ohio visiting and stopped by Frankie's for dinner.  We had pizza with chicken, spinach and artichokes. It was fresh and delicious! We enjoyed the food very much. The waiter was nice and the hostess and other waitress gave us great directions to  SouthPark Mall. We will definately come back here to eat on our next trip  :)"}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is to say it was average. I ordered the meatball sandwich and angel hair pasta with homemade sauce. The meatball sandwich was okay. The meatballs are a bit oversized and were a but over-cooked for my liking. The bread was soft and held the moisture of the sauce well.
The pasta came with bread and a salad. Again the sauce was okay but overall the food wasn't all that great. I probably wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"Niece came to town with her family.  Had dinner there. Had Chicken Marsala.  Nothing but cut up chicken with some onions and mushrooms.  Bland taste.  Side was spaghetti with tomato sauce.  Salad was 95 percent lettuce with one very small piece of tomato and a couple of onion slices.  For almost 20.00 this was a rip off.  I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Then got a Groupon. Can you say ate good, ate cheap, and now I'm full. This is a nice family style restaurant that can handle a single person to a larger group. My server was Debbie R.  Really made me feel welcome. BTW I used Opentable.com, to make my reservation. 
Oh, real important to me, the bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed at what this place has become. I remember when you'd hear people say that Frankie's had the best pizza in town. I don't hear that anymore. It's pretty obvious what's going on, they're trying to cut costs. Even our sodas were watered down. My wife got a side caesar salad and the dressing was just pure mayonnaise. We asked the waitress what was in the dressing but she said they don't make it here.... despite the fact that they advertise that they make their own dressing. I thought surely the pizza would be good. It wasn't. Every pizza topping is a buck seventy five. And the green peppers were clearly canned. For almost two bucks a topping I expect fresh green pepper. Not even Pizza Hut tries to pull that crap. The sauce is bland, the crust was doughy, but at least the cheese was decent. Would not recommend this place. Please Frankie, bring fresh ingredients back."}
{"text":"Brio prices for Sbarro quality!  
For the prices here you wouldn't expect such a low budget experience (paper napkins, miniature peel-tab butter tubs for their de-thawed bread, 1980's decor)

Salad = all white Iceberg lettuce.. no green at all, 1/8 sliver of tomato, 1 slice of cucumber, 1 thin ring of onion.
Bread = See above... not fresh baked, just warmed up
Pasta = Super \"al dente\"
Sauce = Overly Salty, looks like ketchup & tastes like canned Del Monte.. Awful.
Meatball = not very good, tasted old, and way too solid. Breadcrumbs might help.

Entree was just warm, and only ate 1/3 of my food!!!
Service was good.. but we were the Only table in the main dining room at 8:20!  A party was in a rear reserved area/room.

SUMMARY: Over-priced, Low food quality, Pathetic atmosphere, Good service."}

{"text":"Okay place in a strip mall with excellent service.  Friendly staff there to greet the guests and seat you.  We had a great waitress who was friendly and working hard to make sure we had everything we need.  I ordered the lunch portion of Chicken Parmesan.  You get a large portion for lunch so I can only imagine how much you get for dinner!  It was just okay to me.  Fried pretty hard and no flavor for me.  Granted I was coming down with a cold so maybe that was part of the reason I constantly felt like I needed to put salt on mine.  Salad was decent.  My colleague really enjoyed the chicken piccata she  ordered.  She couldn't say enough about how good it was."}

I believe most of the vegetables appear to have been pre-cooked ahead of time .Their house  salad on the other hand was very good.The service was ok the girl was very polite and helpful. Shop is clean but a bit out of date . Not as good of pizza as they use to have when I was a teen"}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE! Go to Danny Boy's instead! Horrible experience. Slow service. Nasty manager. 

I ordered the caprese salad and added \"grilled\" chicken. The chicken was grey and slimy. The server said they didn't have a grill--I think it was boiled. 

My mom ordered the house salad and it is literally just lettuce with cheese on top. She really didn't like it and told the server who took the salad away. When we asked to have the $7 salad taken off the check, the manager literally argued with our table and refused to take the $7 hit. So awkward. So embarrassing. I think this place is so far in \"in the red\" they literally couldn't afford to do it or something.  

HORRIBLE! DON'T GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with friends here and it was SO good. The lasagna was a cheese lover's delight. The au gratin soup was delicious. I wasn't even hungry after half of my lasagna, but I got greedy and ate all of it anyway. I had to unbutton my pants on my drive home. It was a happy feeling.

The only reason I didn't give Frankie's 5 stars was because of the service. Our waiter was nice enough, but he was slow. I think it took about 45 minutes to get a drink order in? He was also slow with the water refills and rather inattentive. I had just come from work and was thirsty, so I was anticipating some water. I'm wondering if next time I should just order a pitcher of ice water with a straw for myself to make it easier on the staff. He brought us a final round of waters and I was delighted. I took a BIG sip... and it was Sprite. I gagged. I have a pretty severe allergic reaction to high fructuose corn syrup containing items. I had hives on my arms and we called it a night after that. I was pretty confused about what the taste was because I can't drink soda unless it has real sugar in it and not HFCS. My friend told me it was Sprite and she kinda laughed at me. My friends' waters were also Sprites. I went home and took some Benadryl and was fine after that. Just startled me a bit. I'll be back, but I'm going to keep a close eye on my water for bubbles."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner on a cold winter's night. house red wine was very tasty, house made salad dressing was delicious, steak cooked perfectly. Server Matt was terrific. And prices were great too.  I will keep this place in mind for the next time I am out near the Cleveland Airport."}
{"text":"Popped in on. Sunday night for a nice meal. I had the Italian Wedding soup which was very good. They also have fresh baked bread that waa amazing. My entre was the Chicken  Parmesean with rigatoni and red sauce on the side. Chicken was nicelg breaded and tasty. Pasta and sauce were also nice. Service was friendly and quick. Would definitely go back."}

{"text":"The food was good, The atmosphere was a little old and dated, But it has a real locals feel to it. The service was good the waiter was very knowledgeable, and our meals seem to come out very fast, If I lived in this area I could see Frankie's as being a place that I Would frequent for Italian food."}
{"text":"My computer was getting slower and slower and my printer gave up the HP ghost.  I went to my friend's house in a faraway western suburb. He always has software that solves everything. After hours of laborious trial and error my computer ran as good as ever and had a new BFF, my on-sale-inkjet printer. 

His lady came home from work and decided it was definitely a going out to dinner evening. After a yelp search for local restaurants and several phone calls it was getting dark and we had not decided on what sounded right. I often drive out Center Ridge when I come to visit so the Italian restaurant in an old house that always looks so inviting came to mind. My friends knew where I meant and agreed if nothing seems right then go Italian. Off we went to Frankie's. 

It had been a warm autumn day with clear skies and leaves at their best. But these same glorious days have sort of creepy evenings with early darkness, falling leaves, and dropping temperatures.  We walked quickly from the shadowy parking lot to the bright little restaurant. Every one of the close together tables was occupied and covered with large white plates of typical southern Italian food. We sat in a corner after a waitress assured us a table would be ready in a few minutes. 

At the table we each scanned the menu looking for the Italian food of our past. The menu is just that a listing of Italian American home cooking. I grew up eating rigatoni, he grew up in a northern Italian house so no red sauce for him, and she was raised in a home where when her dad was alive only angel hair was suitable. We each ordered deep dishes of our favorites as the servers adeptly kept every table happy.

The red sauce on my stove pipes was neither sweet as too many are nor bland as others are. The meatballs were large, tender and tasted of having a long simmer in the sauce.  She thought of her father and how much he would have liked to share her angel hair and meatballs. My friend said his linguine with pesto hit the spot. We left that busy and cozy restaurant and somehow even though Halloween was looming the night seemed safe and friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered a Classic pizza for delivery.  Did not have to decide what to have on it as the Classic has everything I wanted. Pepperoni, Italian  sausage peppers and more.  Arrived in around 30 min hot and good.  I will have to stop by the restaurant and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"After preciously having a very good lunch experience here, we decided to have dinner since in the area. No disappointments!  Special of shrimp cacciatore for my husband and eggplant parm with Frankies special spicy tomato sauce(per my request).  App of traditional fried calamari lightly breaded.   Large portions meant we both took home extras.  A must try. We will be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I don't think I can say anything bad about Frankie's. This is outstanding, as well as the food, the service, the location. The location is about 1/2mile from or so, from I-480, on Great Northern Blvd. Now the service, the servers are pretty much usually, Johnn on the spot, you ask they get it pretty prompt, no matter how busy, the busing crew follows suit with the servers, clean table pretty much as soon as you walk from the table, it's clean and ready for another party. We come to Frankie's on, 1/2 off pizza and appetizers? Tuesday. You walk away paying a very reasonable for, shrimp and brushetta, one XL supreme, two LG specialty one alcoholic drink and three soft drinks for around $60. With pizza to go home with you for lunch or breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great service . They bring out the appetizers salad and main dish in the perfect order. I got the Taste of Italy and is was so good. You can tell this ingredients is fresh and the dishes are authentic. I don't think I will be going back to Olive Garden after trying his place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after an appt.  Our waitress Mary was friendly, knowledgeable, and fast. I ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was fried perfectly. My husband ordered garlic bread with cheese that he enjoyed. We both ordered marinated chicken breast salad. He changed his chicken to fried chicken tenders. Salad was ok. I know, why go to an Italian restaurant and not order pasta, cause I'm on a diet. Once, I'm off this diet we'll definitely go back and get a big bowl of pasta or their pizza. I may change my rating then."}
{"text":"Our family has been ordering Frankie's Pizza for 35 years.  Every Friday night for 35 years. Recently, my mother had a pizza delivered to her home. She charged the pizza on her credit card and provided a cash tip. The delivery person added \"an additional tip\" on the credit slip for himself. My sister called the owner to alert him that he has a dishonest delivery person. The owner said, \"you can't prove it.\" Then hung up on my mom. The 35 year tradition has officially ended. Oh, and shame on you."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had!!! My boyfriend and I go there often on Tuesdays for half price pizzas. The service and food are AMAZING! This place definitely deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Frankie's. Cannot speak to the service/food within the restaurant but our delivery was atrocious. We were told 45 minutes for our food and it wasn't delivered for almost an hr and a half. Our pizza was cold and the Chicken Parmesan was so hard it was difficult to get a knife through. The spaghetti that came with it tasted as if it had been removed from the freezer and thawed. NOT acceptable for food that cost over $40. It worth noting that the ticket was printed an hr before our food was delivered. How exactly does it take an hour to go 4.8 miles? This was our second disappointing try with Frankie's and we will not waste our money again."}
{"text":"Kind of a bummer to give them 3 stars. I've eaten here a few times and the food has been great at times, average others. Got the calamari appetizer which was pretty good but had lemon slices instead of wedges. How am I supposed to squeze a lemon slice over calamari? The side salad was just iceberg lettuce out of a bag with 1 grape tomato and 1 cucumber slice. The bread that came out with the meal was a little too done for my liking- borderline burnt, had to ask for a different loaf. The cheese manicotti was awesome, lots of cheese inside and on top. They have Coca-Cola Freestyle as well which gives them points in my book. We had a $12 off coupon from a local coupon book, but the bill was still $40 before tip. Server was attentive and friendly but we were seated next to a party of 12 very loud people when there were 2 of us. We could've sat anywhere. Seems to happen a lot. Lol. I'd eat here again, but wouldn't go out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"Had the Mediterranean Pizza for first visit to Frankie's.  I thought it was a fine pizza and enjoyed it.  I'm curious about all the negative reviews because it was a solid pizza and the staff was very nice. Was it the best pizza I've every had?  Not for me but if you served it to me once a week it would be a perfectly good meal.  The toppings were generous and fresh, the white garlic sauce was tasty.  Crust is a bit thick for me so that's a personal preference and prob part of what accounts for the 3-stars.  Pizza is a very personal taste -- thick or thin crust, topping combos, baked crispy or baked lightly brown, Red or white sauce. You get my drift. I think if you stopped off for dinner or ordered delivery you'd have a satisfying experience.  You might even find for you is great pizza because it all depends what you like in a pizza.  And although I arrived at a 3-star, a-ok rating that doesn't make it a bad pizza but rather not the way I like a pizza.  If you want a deal they often have a Groupon which is a chance to give it a try for a bargain."}
{"text":"ok it has taken me over 24 hours to write this review.  I struggled with what I was going to say about the food.  after reading some of the reviews, and some very high marks, I come to realize that a lot of people don't have a very good palate.  I had pizza...supreme to be exact, and it was probably one of the saddest pizzas I have ever eaten.  The sauce was not how I remembered, which is why I went back to get pizza.  The pizza came out hot, but all the toppings were loose on top of the pizza.  it was like someone has cheese pies back there and a plastic container with all the frozen veggies and just dumped them over the pizza.  the toppings just fell off as I was trying to eat it.  I could of gotten a better pizza at my local Costco.  we shared a salad, which was swimming in this sweet poppy style dressing.  the only upside to the whole experience is the waitress.....she was good, but you could tell she was embarrassed on what she was serving.  the kicker to the whole thing is when we had a coupon for money off....and she said we couldn't use it...wasn't good for pizza, just entrees.  she stated that the owner talked to the printers and told them they needed to be more specific, and that I need to read the coupon better lol.  we let it go, but I will never go back to frankies.  and seriously, im not sure how they lasted this long.  I shake my head on what some people find delicious.

pros:  waitress 

Cons:  food, décor, PRICES WAY TO HIGH

this foodie will find a can of Franco American before I eat there again."}
{"text":"The food was great I had a chicken parmesan, the wife had sausage Italiano . we really enjoyed the food. Very lage portions. very clean and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first visit with my daughter and think this will certainly involve another visit.  Just realized I forgot to use my texting 10% off coupon.  Oh well...I enjoyed the family restaurant style atmosphere.  The food and service was good.  They also offer the flavor mixer for beverages which is cool."}
{"text":"First time here, good food with a very laid back mom and pop feel.  Good portions, prices on the slightly higher side for pasta.   I got the bombaloti which is basically fettuccine Alfredo with mild Italian sausage and broccoli.. Very good, around $18, enough to take home for another meal.   We did get the calamari and I can't recommend it.. Slightly chewy w/ a fishy after taste, but far from the worst I've ever had.   Service was excellent, very friendly but like I said mom and pop atmosphere so don't expect a well polished server.  Will return!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I have ever had.
The crust is thick, not greasy, and dare I say sweet?  It is truly wonderful.  Why can't more pizza places make dough like this?

The prices are high for pizza but the quantity of toppings explains why.  The Deluxe and Buffalo chicken are monthly staples for us.

I have branched out to other menu items but the pizza is where it's at."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Frankies for years! We chose to go there last night for a graduation/birthday celebration. Our server, Nancy was thee best! Very friendly, helpful even made a few jokes.I could tell she was sincere in her efforts. Food is always great, except for the Alfredo sauce. It's just missing a little \"uumpf\". Maybe if they used heavy whipping cream or garlic or something to make it stand out, then it would be amazing. Of course the famous Frankies salad with house dressing and fresh cheese is always a hit, we're always satisfied!"}
{"text":"So we get Frankie's to go about once a week. We LOVE their pizza, authentic sauce, and crunchy crust. 

House salad is just to die for, along with their tiramisu. 

OH and the Italian wedding soup is grandpa's new favorite. 

Try the pizza, you won['t want anything else."}
{"text":"I ordered the jumbo buffalo wings (hot) and a large pizza (half ham and half sausage, onion, mushrooms, and black olives).  The wings were okay, but certainly not hot (spicy).  The best part of the wings was the bleu cheese dipping sauce.  The pizza, including the sauce, veggies, and meats, had no flavor.  The one flavor that came through the most was that of the yeast from the dough."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about this place but I have to admit it - it's good stuff.  Regardless of dated interior and scarce veggies in the salad ( after all you don't come to restaurant to admire new carpet or count cucumbers in your salad), it's worth paying for.
Highlights of the dinner were house dressing ( very evolved version of poppy seed one) and chicken Tosca. The latter was simply divine-melting-in-your-mouth experience. Calamari were also good, maybe a tad over-fried, but again, who cares about that when you were given more than full glass of excellent malbec to wash it down? 
On my own scale of authenticity, it was 8 out of 10. And how they still haven't taken  Olive Garden down the street out of business, I'll never know."}
{"text":"They have lost my business yesterday, Friday September 29th 2017!
We came in at 6:45 pm, about two parties of 4 and 2 each people waiting for a table, plenty empty tables, but the hostess did not seat any of us. We asked how long it would take, and she stated she would get back to us in a minute. She never got back to us, we waited for over 30 minutes, more people came in, some left, some began waiting, a single man was seated right away on a table for 4.
After over 30 minutes the hostess came over and told all of us the kitchen was backed up and it would take another hour to get served.
Why don't they seat customers, offer them something to drink and go from there?
This is lousy customer service! I am NOT going back there!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday at about 6 pm. We were seated right away. Service was excellent. The spaghetti with mushrooms, spaghetti with meatballs and a calzone were fresh and the sauce was perfect. The salads and garlic bread were also very good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place on Groupon.  Since it was rated \"best of groupon 2012,\" we were optimistic. My first impression of the restaurant was that the interior is a bit outdated. The hostess was friendly, but our waitress was not very attentive. 
Even after the first impression, I was still feeling excited to try the food. Then, the waitress brought out our \"spicy\" BBQ boneless wings, and I was immediately wishing we had gone to the Chik-fil-A next door.  The wings were dry and the sauce was bland...not spicy at all.  Next, she brought out our side salads with the infamous house dressing. It was alright, nothing to write home about.  Finally, our entrees were ready.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  They were good, not great. Overall, I'd say a can of Prego has more flavor.  My boyfriend had the seafood linguini.  He said the sauce and the shrimp were overcooked. Since we had a groupon for $30 the waitress suggested we add cookies to our order to get our money's worth.  The cookies were surprisingly the best part of the meal. Perhaps the pizza would have been a better choice.  I would not recommend the pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I've been eating here from as long as I can remember. I highly recommend the Hot and Spicy Pizza or the Margherita Pizza. And of course the Frankie's House Salad. They have half off pizza on Tuesday nights. The service is always friendly whether its take out, delivery or dining in."}
{"text":"I ! took advantage of a groupon, what a disappointment. The vegetarian pizza had mushrooms, green peppers, olives, and onions dumped on top, not even baked in with cheese, the \"fresh mushrooms\" tasted like canned mushrooms. The crust was soggy with a rubbery texture, sauce was very watery with no substance(probably why the crust was soft).overall blan tasting, will not go here again."}
{"text":"Generally, this place is pretty good. It's not the best Italian food I have ever had but not bad either. I got the Chicken Marsala with cavatellis. My husband got the Chicken Parmesan with spaghetti. Both entrees were pretty standard. I can't say this place is at the top of my list to return to but I wouldn't say I would never go back either."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not fantastic or memorable. 

I went in for dinner with two friends we ordered the following:
Lasagna - very good. Cheesy!
Chicken Parm - pretty good. Fresh tomatoes topped the 2 chicken breasts. Good sized portion. 
BBQ chicken pizza - pretty good. But nothing compared to Angelo's or Danny Boys. 

Ordered their homemade cannolis to finish (2 per order). Absolutely HORRIBLE!! Filling lacked many choc chips, but had plenty of chopped maraschino cherries. Was runny and had a cool whip taste and consistency. Yuck! Definitely don't recommend them. 

Our server was friendly, descriptive, and adequate."}
{"text":"I was visiting from California and everyone said Ohio is famous for its Italian restaurants. I ordered Chicken Alfredo and Lasagna which are the basic dishes which cannot go wrong at all. Chicken Alfredo was bland and the Alfredo sauce was alien to me. Lasagna o my god I could have asked a 7 year old to cook it for me better. Horrible food and the lasagna noodle was not cooked and the cheese was ice cold between the bites. Never recommend you to order to go from this place and waste of $$ seriously."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN USA

I moved away from N. Olmsted 25 years ago and still have not found a better pizza, chicago has some awesome deep dish pie's but you could not imagine how many times when I am eating a inferior pizza or just at home watching a football game that I wished I had a Frankies pizza.

I have wanted to franchise this place for 20 years...I should have talked to the owners a long time ago

I remember riding my moped there 35 years ago and sitting outside on the pavement eating a small pepperoni pizza.

They still taste exactly the same today...AWESOME"}
{"text":"Have been going here for many years & have never been disappointed in the service or the food .. that house dressing of theirs is to die for & I make a special trip there from time to time to just buy that to go & stock my fridge! .. pizza is wonderful & their pasta dishes are a very generous portion .. plan to be a regular patron for many more years to come!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Pizza (especially the spicy pizza) is excellent.  Pastas are really good. Service has been above average.  Prices are fair and the place is clean  Waiting area is way small and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Went here on father's day, kind of last minute.  Had a wait of about 15 minutes.  Wife had a shrimp artichoke pasta dish, very yummy.  I had the sausage pepper onion angelhair pasta dish, also very Yummy.  WARNING:  Servings are huge, we should have split one so a lot went to waste.  We were staying at a hotel, so couldn't do leftovers."}
{"text":"The key to Frankie's pizza is the sauce.  It's got more onion than your typical pizza sauce, and it's aged - so it's not too sweet.

I spent most of my life in North Olmsted.  Some of my friends tell me that I think too highly of Frankie's because I grew up with it - and therefore it's my \"baseline.\"  This may be true, but most friends I bring agree with me - and some travel from quite far away to eat here.

Also worth noting - the house salad.  For a cheese lover like me, it's awesome.  And the house dressing has a flavor I've never tasted anywhere else.  Think celery seed meets pineapple juice (that's my best guess at the recipe).

The garlic bread with cheese is way better than average - even though it's on an Orlando hoagie bun.  It's probably the type of cheese mix they use.

And lastly - when I'm not in a pizza mood - I get the Veal Piccata, but I commit the sin of having cheese melted on it.  At some Italian restaurants the chef would chase you out with a cleaver in his hand for suggesting such a modification, but Frankie's is always accommodating.

One gripe - it seems like the crust has changed over the past few years - and not for the better.  Dryer and less flavorful - like it was frozen.  But that's not enough to knock them out of 5 star range for me.

If you have a chance to eat here - do it."}
{"text":"Can't believe there is not a review of Frankie's in North Olmsted.  As a past Ohio resident I've been coming here since 1981 and it has always been a family staple!  Their pizza's are amazing and the sauce is fantastic.  The cheese they use is sooo tasty.  I am vegetarian now, and even just a plain cheese pizza is amazing.  When I was a carnivore, I always got a pepperoni pizza and it was also dynamite!  If you go, you must get the Frankie's House Salad, which is made up of lettuce (unfortunately it is iceberg, wish they would use romaine)  Frankie's homemade dressing and a pile of cheese on top!  I know pizza and salad may be a weird combo, but I assure you it is not!  Also my girlfriend is vegan and she is also able to eat here.  She gets the angel hair pasta with spicy marinara sauce.  Just ask them to make it vegan, not sure if it is on the menu or not?  It is somewhat pricey to eat here, but it is well worth the expense!  The taste says it all!!  Living in Chicago now makes me wish I had a Frankie's here."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Frankie's Italian Cuisine!  Been going there for years, and the food is awesome!  The fantastic, aromatic pizza alone is a NE Ohio institution!  Without question, in the top 3 around these parts.  I'm a 'pizza snob' and conoisseur, having been spoiled by the great, world class 'mom and pop' run Italian restaurant pizzas in the NY/NJ area, when I lived there.  Frankie's pizza is 'to die for'!  I love their crispy iceberg lettuce house salad as well, with the sweet & sour dressing and shredded cheese.  I'm salivating like Pavlov's Dog, just thinking of the place!

My family will continue to dine there, as we support local, dedicated family owned and run businesses rather than national chains!  We have consistently had great service and great food from this North Olmsted landmark.  Thanks for listening."}
{"text":"im a sucker for the calzones and antipasto......have been for over a decade. frankies is a landmark, love em"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years.  Our favorite waitresses are Nancy & Candy.  We usually get a bottle of Pinot Grigio - that is until the the restaurant changes hands from sister to brother and he changed the wine.

They now serve Voga, which is not very tasty.  If they're trying to save money on an inexpensive bottle of wine, I'd rather drink a $6.99 bottle of Cavit from Giant Eagle or Drug Mart.

Please Please Please add another choice of Pinot Grigio to your selection.  The Voga is awful!"}
{"text":"Once again amazing food! Italian chili ridiculously good! Service is consistent. But if you want great food and great service ask for Richie a amazing server!"}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE! Went for dinner on 6/22 at 7:34 and the place was NOT busy, not even a little. Several tables open. The manager (assuming), does NOT look up and say hello, how are you, nothing. He says, couple minutes. Walks away, comes back, says, couple minutes. 
More than a \"couple minutes\" go by, the hostess and waitress are talking at the hostess stand and one says, I don't know why he will not allow us to seat anyone (us). After 13 minutes of waiting (a few minutes plus 10) we said, screw this there are several other places around here. They clearly don't give a rats ass about customer service. We walked! That is piss poor management and unprofessional at its finest. The place is dirty and with just the people \"greeting guests\", I would HIGHLY recommend staying free and clear from this joint. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I call frankie's Frankie's waves.. because its goes in waves of being really good and awful. Sometimes you go there you have wonderful and attentive service with good food and other times you wait ten minutes to have someone come and take your drink order and the food is greasy and overly cheesy. I honestly no longer go to Frankie's because I have no way of knowing what kind of service I am going to get."}
{"text":"Frankie's is amazing! A must go to restaurant in a North Olmstead.  Nancy was our server and she was so friendly and did such a great job taking care of us. The food was delicious, one of the best meals we have had in a long time. We will definitely return soon!!!"}
{"text":"I  worked for Frankies in High school at Detroit road location. Food was bad ass back then. oooh the maranara, I used to buy it to take home telling my parents I cooked it at home. lol shhh
    Recently when at a friends house he brought in some frankies pizza. I was over the top with excitement and the pie did not disappoint. 
    Real deal Italian folks, strait up!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Frankie's. The cavatelli and eggplant Parmesan are my favorites. The sauce is really good, a little on the sweeter side which I prefer. Tuesday's they have 1/2 off appetizers and pizza which is a great deal. Their bread is really good too with sesame seeds and they at happy to being you as much as you want."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I had their version of tour of Italy, olive garden is way better. The chicken parm was bland and had a big piece of raw tomato on it under melted cheese. The lasagna was mediocre, and the sauce had cinnamon in it. The fettuccine Alfredo was bland, again olive garden was better. The salad was iceberg lettuce, one cherry tomato, and two pieces of onion. I'm not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Food is very bland and lacks flavor. Had an extremely disappointing $17 Chicken Alfredo that had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. Looks like it was made in a rush."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always order takeout or delivery. They come when they say, the delivery person is always kind, and the food is excellent. I would recommend to order the cookie, my family and I will eat a dozen quicker than we should! I love getting their calzones!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and  found this place on Yelp. The food was very good but the service was s-l-o-w. Make sure you have plenty of time if you go."}
{"text":"We stopped up at Frankie's for a family dinner last week on Thursday kind of on a whim. This wasn't my first time so I kind of knew the drill that I would be getting a filling Italian meal.
 
Frankie's is in a strip mall close to Great Northern Mall in North Olmsted. The décor is dated, the servers are friendly and you really get the feeling of a good local business. We had no wait to sit down on that particular night but most nights around dinner time you will have to wait for a table. The menu is pretty much Italian classics and they do hit the mark. My lasagna and my fiancé's manicotti were fresh and filling. I like the complimentary bread and salad that comes along with the entrée (nothing special but free!). I have to say that the pasta and the lemon chicken they serve are very good. I hope to try their pizza in the near future.
 
Also, props to our waiter who brought my 4 year old son's meal out early (such a smart gesture that lots of restaurants can learn from). Thanks Frankie's, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic.  Our waitress was the sweetest lady.  The food wasn't bad.  It was passable Midwestern I-talian-- nothing that would fool you into thinking you had been transported to Sicily, but better than the chain places.  The problem that will keep me from ever going there again-- the hour and a half wait for my food."}
{"text":"My family came here for lunch and we had bought a Groupon that was pay $15 for $30 at the restaurant. I got the Chicken Parmesan lunch portion and I thought it was delicious and a perfect lunch portion size. The chicken had a nice crispy breading and a very tender inside. The pasta was al dente and the tomato sauce was delicious. 

My Mom and Dad ordered the Chicken Alfredo lunch portion and they also said it was delicious. The chicken looked grilled and was very tender. The Alfredo was good and creamy and the fettuccine was cooked nicely. 

Each of our meals were $7.50. Which I though was very modest for the nice portion sizes, the salads and roll that came with each of our meals. Overall I would definitely come back for lunch if I'm in the area again before 4pm. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I give the pizza 5 stars. Definitely one of the best in Cleveland. It tastes very similar to Danny Boys. I am guessing they use a rotating deck oven. The crust, sauce and cheese are almost identical. The sauce is terrific. It is a well-herbed and thicker sauce. I would say this pizza could be possibly in my top 5 in the Cleveland area. The other dishes we tried were alright. I would not recommend ordering them because the pizza is the real standout. I will have to update my favorite pizza list on Yelp and add this. I highly recommend the pizza!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other night, prices seemed a little bit high but we had a groupon.  I ordered the chicken marsala, it was very very bland.  I ate about 1/4 of it & gave the rest to my boyfriend.  The side of rigatoni with meat sauce was ok which is what I ended up eating as my meal.  My boyfriend took one bite of the marsala & immediately picked up the salt shaker, this was after I had already salted it.  The marsala sauce was more like a broth then sauce and had more of a yellow color rather then the normal light brown color that I am used to.  I asked my boyfriend if he liked it and his response was \"if you like chicken soup you might like this\".  Our waitress was very nice, & the homemade house dressing was very good.  Would most likely not return but my boyfriend and I agreed if we did return for some reason we would only order pizza."}
{"text":"I've tried Frankie's twice now for carryout for business lunch because I work five minutes away. I have to say I'm unimpressed. I'm in the restaurant business myself, one of my two jobs, so I can be pretty understanding as well as pretty critical. Also, Italian food is my all time favorite so I place a high value on restaurants that specialize in it. I DO work at an Italian restaurant, but this review reflects no bias, for I believe each place holds it's own merit and I have no problem eating at \"the competition.\" 

Anyways, the first time I tried the food was probably around 5 months ago and it was the chicken parm sandwich. The chicken was fried and that's not unexpected, but I hoped for maybe baked because I feel that's the real way to cook chicken for a respectable restaurant such as this; so no points taken off because it wasn't particularly greasy. The problem with the sandwich, however, lied in that it was critically under-sauced, making it dry. The same happened for my boss on her meatball sub. These sandwiches were kind of hard to get through. I admit I like things over sauced, but I can objectively say it seemed like no more than a small spoonful of sauce. The potato wedges I got with it were fine, but nothing special. 

Today was our second time ordering from here. I got the cheese tortellini with the roasted red pepper pesto sauce and regrettably it was undersauced yet again. There looked to be a tablespoon full of the pesto over a very large order of pasta; note the portion size is to it's credit! I even ordered extra sauce on the side anticipating this and it was but a plastic ramekin full and still left it under sauced. Now, this was a chunky red pepper pesto and I don't know how big the portion size would usually be, but it was bland and with most of the tortellini being without it, was also very bland. This made me wonder if I had ordered a sauce that is usually served plentifully, like the alfredo, would it have had an adequate amount on it, or would it too have been light? It wasn't awful, but overall, meh. The bread that came with it looked like an unsliced sub roll, but it was pretty good.

I also got an order of the clam chowder (New England style). It wasn't out of this world, but it definitely was my favorite part of the meal. 

Overall, I feel this is good for run of the mill Italian, but not a place I would pick if given a choice. If you're in a hurry to pick up something after work or out and about and don't feel like going far, this place will do."}
{"text":"We visited Frankie's for the first time on a Saturday at 11:30 because we had a Groupon certificate. Dawn was our server and she was GREAT! Very friendly and very attentive. We ordered an extra large pizza and my husband got pepperoni and sausage on his half and I got cheddar cheese and green olives. Nice amount of toppings. We had plenty to take home too!  We enjoyed our visit so much we bought another Groupon certificate when we got home. We live in Mansfield and have no problem driving 90 minutes to eat here. Its worth it! :-)"}
{"text":"It isn't just me, after all.

It had been a few years since I had a pizza from here.  Wasn't really impressed those 3 or 4 times previous, but a coupon reminded me of a recent recognition they had received.  On this coupon it stated that It was a Reader's Choice Award for Best Pizza for 2011, Northwest Region.  (Not printed on coupon, but probably the Plain Dealer.)

For takeout, ordered a large specialty Deluxe at 17.50.   
  Traditional pizza sauce       Pepperoni         Mushrooms
   Italian Sausage          Green Pepper           Onions
   
The coupon didn't apply, but Tina told me that on Tuesdays between 4-10:00pm, all pizzas (dine-in only) are 50% off.  That's a very good deal at just 8.75, but once beverages and tip are added onto that, it would have well exceeded the 8.75 savings.  Still worth it for the convenience.

pizza crust  *      
flavorless---with dry edges and soft, bread-like base

toppings  * * * * 
all fresh, good-tasting, and plentiful...about 1' high...nicely flavored sauce and cheese...of three slices that I ate over 24 hours, only one bite had discernible gristle in a piece of sausage 

the next day  * *
crust was way too soggy, even after 20 minutes in toaster oven...likely because of the generous amount of toppings soaking in, so not necessarily their fault.  

Too bad.  Wish I had liked it.  Unless a restaurant really deserves it, I hate giving any reviews that are less than 4 stars.   My pizza crust may have been the exception.   Maybe visited them on a less-than-their-usual crust day---or batch.  Be that as it may---if the crust isn't a stand-out, it can never be a good pizza.  Good toppings maybe---but not a good pizza.  Anything that's placed onto any dough---from sausage and green pepper, to pate, roasted duck breast, truffles, or even caviar---can never improve the overall experience if the flavor and texture of the crust isn't perfect or close to it.   

Don't be negatively influenced by my review.  Try it for yourself.   Will continue trying new ones---and re-trying old ones---off and on.  In-between times, if I absolutely MUST have a pizza that I can count on, I'll make my own from scratch (don't really want to) or I'll purchase my favorite basic sauce and cheese style from a well-known chain (if interested, you can see my other reviews) and add my own toppings.  May sound self-defeating---especially when a pizza is considered a fairly quick, and ready-to-eat item---but when not in a \"good pizza-quest\" mode, I'll always opt for quality no matter the inconvenience, over convenience."}

Decor is a tad too teal for me, but it really doesn't take away from the overall dining experience.

Again, get the house salad."}

It is perfect and tjey have a special area just for takeout so you're not crowding in the main restaurant. The bombolotti is my go to entree! Sometimes a little dry but I add on a side of extra sauce and it's perfect! It comes with a salad and bread so you'll definitely have lots of leftovers, especially with the Groupon being for $30 worth of food!"}
