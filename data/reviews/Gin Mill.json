{"text":"There is definitely a need for a cosy joint with good food that isn't too \"pub\"ish along this stretch of Bloor and the Gin Mill hits the spot. It's family-friendly without being all chicken nuggets and ice cream.
The food is great - big fan of the venison croqs and steak sandwich.
I didn't get a chance to sample the craft beers but look forward to checking them out in the coming weeks."}
{"text":"Came by for a soup and a couple of beers and the service and atmosphere was perfect. Very interesting and diverse menu means I'll be coming back to sample some more!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Went for lunch, had the venison croqs to start, and a burger with fries. Both were excellent. Service was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Found this place on my way home and decided to try it out. I really liked the pub-style environment and cocktail menu. Definitely would recommend d it as a good spot for drinks. I didn't get a chance to check out the food menu or bar upstairs but will on my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place opened in February, on the site of the Yellow Griffin in Bloor West Village. On our first visit they had only been open a few days. While dealing with the usual chaos of opening a new spot, I thought they did really well. The servers were slammed, but were apologetic and very helpful. The manager had a great knowledge about the beers on sale and was very engaging. A return trip was therefore definitely warranted. Visit #1 would have got a 4/5. 

Visit #2 is where things went pear shaped. The previous server/manager were not there. Instead Mr hipster (tats/earholes etc etc) was there, as was his boyfriend. The BF was a total hunk, so much so, that the bartender was incapable of service as he was captivated by his dreamboat eyes. Eventually, we asked him if we could have some drinks. He was not happy about this. The nerve - asking a bartender to pour some drinks and interrupting his cuddling session. He reluctantly took the order - furiously googling how to make the cocktails on the cocktail menu. Finally, some progress. But then, sadly, the BF had to leave. Reflecting the intensity of this romance, the goodbye was lengthy. While our partially made drinks were sitting on the bar, he slowly walked the BF to the door (again - the passion is clear here). Not only did he see him out the door, he watched as the hunk walked away, for several minutes, like something out of Hollywood - watching his shadow dissipate in the gently falling snow - beautiful moment really.

He then returned to the bar and got the drinks. One of the beers was about an inch and a half below the rim. The manhattan was not shaken, he simply googled what a manhattan was, put vermouth, rye and bitters in a glass, and brought it over. No garnish, no ice, no love! I know new places have teething issues, but letting a server like this run your operation unsupervised is lunacy. Management is essential in the early days. Obviously customers need to give a place a chance when new, but having staff on that ignore customers because they are passionately in love, wonderful as that is, just doesn't fly- this guy is hurting what could be a great little business."}
{"text":"A crazy name when they specialize in craft beer.  OK, I understand the historical significance, but still...  The ambiance, or lack thereof, does not match their much too high prices.  I thought I would just drop in for a beer and a light lunch.  I ordered the calamari expecting it to be fried and battered, it wasn't.  My mistake.  Leah, the friendly waitress, probably noticing that I was having a problem chewing those rubbery baby octopuses, cheerfully changed my order to mussels.  A much better choice.  
     Another thing: the 'music' my pet peeve, it is not necessary!  You are either with a group trying to hold a conversation or alone, as I was, trying to read.
And over eight dollars for a pint of admittedly good beer, is much too much. 
     Change the name in your credit card machine, it still says Yellow Griffin.
   Oh, and case you're wondering my beer was Brimstone IPA."}
