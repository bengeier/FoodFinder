{"text":"the best place on earth. despite being pretty busy even at odd hours, the employees have been claiming that they're going out of business for at least ten years now. arrive early to hear christopher (the grill man) curse himself as a \"fucking cheesesteak slave\" or listen to john himself casually mention how shitty his life is. the only thing better than the cheesesteaks are the meatball hoagies, and i legitimately struggle with deciding which one to get days before i even get back into town. they use only the realest rolls \"from conshohocken\" and utz crab chips are usually stocked. as of thanksgiving 2010, the arcade features mortal kombat 3, but asking john to break a dollar so you can play is not for the faint of heart."}
{"text":"I don't want to even give this place a star after I what I witnessed the other day.  I randomly decided to stop here to pick up dinner on my way home after work when I witnessed the owner yelling at a senior citizen.  She was sitting at a table with her family and he was seriously yelling in her face while holding what appeared to be a personal Stromboli of some sort.  I don't know what happened but this guy will never get my business!  He stormed away from the family and they just sat there.  I walked out without ever placing an order...the family should have left too.  To the owner, You don't treat customers like they are meaningless and you never, ever disrespect a woman."}
{"text":"Understaffed but great food and the bickering that goes makes it kind of like dinner and a show.  It's a fun place with great food."}
{"text":"The good news is the decent to better than average cheesesteak. The bad news, it got so uncomfortable listening to the tirade of the cook that we have not been back in months...and don't plan on going back. Minus two stars (from the 4 star food) for the petty, biting bickering that you have to put up with. And no, they are not like the Soup Nazi; at least he was entertaining and had a catch phrase."}
{"text":"The cheesesteaks are great. Huge and tasty. And I Agree with the others - listening to John and his son argue is hysterical."}
{"text":"They'll get 2 stars for the quality of the Chicken Steak. It is very good. Everything else though..... not so much. Extremely slow service. My kids pizza was overcooked as was my other kids cheese burger. How does this place have a 4 star rating? A table of nuns were also here for lunch. They wanted a sandwich with white bread.... No luck, they only have wheat today. Overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"I travel extensively and can say John's Pizza is one of the best, if not the best, I've ever eaten! I had the Special of the House today. Quality ingredients, tasty sauce, and good conversation with Chris! He is a hard working man that is serious about quality food and customer service. You can easily catch a glimpse of his big heart underneath his demanding demeanor!"}
{"text":"Zero Stars - Food was mediocre at best. I agree with Mike R. about the tirade of the owner/cook and employees ruining the dining experience. Screaming and swearing makes it unsuitable for anyone, especially families with children. I don't consider it to be entertainment like some reviewers. I cannot understand why people are willing to give their hard-earned money to these people. Also, the restaurant was not clean, the staff does not routinely wash their hands and they allow non-employees to enter the food preparation/grill area."}
{"text":"Best hoagies and cheesesteaks in the area.  I have been coming here for 30 years.  The John's special italian hoagie rocks."}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy.  Wish I lived closer.  Very local feel with regulars coming in and calling the owner by name.  On second thought, its probably better that I don't live close, otherwise I'd be here all the time.  The food is really good.

From the guy from Texas, thanks Chris and Desire for showing/serving me a real Philly cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"The staff was smoking inside the restaurant. That's NOT acceptable."}
{"text":"We live in Atlanta, GA area. My husband is from the area and introduced me to John's during Thanksgiving. Oh. My. GOD! The cheesesteaks and hoagies are fantastic! We will definitely be back every single time we go back to PA now. Sorry it took so long to write a review, but I guess I just kept dreaming about it and forgot to actually sit down and type."}
{"text":"I lived in the area for 30 years, and John's was always a favorite place to grab a great hoagie or cheesesteak. The pizza is good too, but it's much easier to find good pizza than it is to find a really good cheesesteak.  The staff can be a bit quirky, but anytime I'm back in Chester Co. I come here for the food.  If you're looking for a great cheesesteak or hoagie, look no further.  The only other place in the area that's equally good is Joeys in Thorndale."}
{"text":"all the sandos are awesome... i come here all the time for lunch on the go, its always fun to see the family on the verge of a huge blowup... ive been going for almost 20 years and the battles have never changed

sure you may not want to bring your kid here, but if you want a good sandwich and enjoy italian profanity this place hits a home run 

pay the old man in cash and hell damn near come around the counter and hug you"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS. This is by far the WORST service I have ever experienced in my life. 

I was seeing a movie with a friend in the area so we decided to stop here for a quick dinner. I ordered a California Cheesesteak with no onion. The sandwich came out with onions cooked in it, so I sent it back. The cook/owner, John said there was only one onion and proceeded to pick the onions out with his hands. I requested a new Cheesesteak and he started yelling saying that he wasn't going to make me another sandwich and was throwing things in the kitchen. My friend and I were shocked by this horrendous service. We told the owner and waitress that we would never come back and John said to us, \"You know, I didn't want to make that sandwich for you anyway. You can leave, don't come back I don't care.\"

I was shocked other people were in there eating and didn't seem bothered by this tirade. The waitress just laughed it off and said that that  is how John is, but I did not find it amusing in the least and there is absolutely no excuse for that behavior. 

DO NOT eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Please read this:  John and his son have owned this amazing restaurant for over 45 years in Frazer.   45 YEARS of the most consistent delicious food you will ever eat, From Cheesesteaks to Calzone to Pizza to the warm, caring greeting you get the second you walk thru the door.  It is now solely owned by Chris, John's son that took it to the next level TIMES 10.   This place should be written up in the top 5 GLOBALLY for the best Italian experience for food...  just incredible ... please know that his place cares so much about your overall experience ... THE BEST"}
{"text":"Say what you want about all other areas of criticism for this place, but you cannot get a better cheesesteak / buffalo chicken cheesesteak anywhere else nearby. Good quality steak/cheese/roll/onions&peppers. Real philly Italians!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I ever ate!.... The crust is not your usual...it has a very nice almost sweet/sour flavor and is made fresh daily.  The pizza sauce is to die for and also not your run-of-the-mill. Try their cheesesteak stromboli w/fried onions for a change of pace...it is awesome made in their delicious dough.  Cheesesteaks are easily some of the best around using legendary Amarosa rolls.  The owner is somewhat eccentric and is prone to wig out at times...but wtf cares, really??  Its all part of the original ambience of a place that has withstood the passage of time and generations.  If you want excellent pizza and cheesesteaks, this is the place for you.  If you demand courtesy and proper etiquette in every way, I suggest you go elsewhere.  In the end, its all bout the food here..and they have been doing that damn well for decades!"}
{"text":"Came for good pizza and the legendary experience of watching the staff argue with each other to the point of discomfort on the part of the customer, left empty handed. 

The pizza was a mess. Cheese and sauce everywhere, very underwhelming crust. It didn't reheat well and while both employees were really nice, it felt like they devoted much more of their time to the rest of their menu than to their pizza."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for lunch and customer satisfaction is #1  I love the tuna and cheese on rye."}
{"text":"Stingy with cheese on Philly. Service lousy. Waitress chick acted like it just killed her to refill drinks. Two sandwiches two drinks and one onion ring was over $30. 
I won't come back."}
{"text":"The gold standard for steak sandwiches for 30 years. nough said.

oh yea - the comment about the in-fighting family? you wouldn't believe the stories if i told 'em... stuff o legend."}
{"text":"Jonesing a slice this afternoon I hit up the first place I saw on Lancaster Avenue which unfortunately was John's.  Got a weird vibe from the get-go but nonetheless ordered a small cheese pie to go.  Then I heard the owner screaming in Italian and the sounds of pots and pans clanging.  Maybe he was cranky because he was hungry?  If so, he got to eat my pie because I gtf out and went to Jack's across the street."}
{"text":"I am, by nature, an agressive driver. I am a firm believer in DRIVING in the left hand lane. If you want to ride, there's a whole lane reserved for you and all the other grandparents on the right, so move your lame minivan out of the way. When i know I'm on my way to get John's, though, my driving gets downright mean. If you come between me and my cheesesteak, expect to get run straight off the road, Mad Max Style. How good is this place? So good that it is still isted in the \"frequently visited locations\" section of the GPS on my phone. And I live in Tennessee! 

While I haven't driven all the way from Tennessee to Malvern, PA just to get a cheesesteak, I definitely stop in whenever I am in the North: Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Deleware, Rhode Island, Conneticut, Western PA, Central PA, New York, New Jersey; no amount of distance is too great for me to travel to get my hands on these amazing cheesteaks. This is the best cheesesteak in Pennsylvania. I not equivacating, embelleshing, lying or exxgerating. Game over, man, game over. From the regionally sourced bread, to the thinly sliced steak, to copious amounts of provolone cheese (Chris, John's son, doesn't even carry a cheese whiz option on the menu. Ask him for it. I dare you), this is the ONLY way you should make a cheesesteak. Throw on some relish, mustard, ketchup, mushrooms, and peppers, and you too will be making 3 hour roundtrips to suckle at the teat of nirvana. 

I don't understand a lot of the criticisim surrounding the service, either. These guys have been banging out cheesesteaks for longer than I have been alive. They have NEVER been rude or disrespectful to my family. In fact, we roll so deep up there that they often have to order another supply truck when we are in town. (My grandpa used to call ahead and tell them \"the family\" was coming. That's my grandpa, his wife, my mom, my aunt, my mom's four kids, my aunt's four kids, and my cousin's 3-8 kids, depending on who's in town. And we all can eat.) We roll in, order our 20+ cheesesteaks, 2-3 calzones, and 2-3 pizzas, and then I ask the family \"what are yall eating\"?! *drum flourish* Cracks em up everytime. The family may be loud and argumentitive, but so is mine, so who am I to judge? 

If you get tired of the cheesesteaks, try a pizza or a calozone or whatever else they have. I promise you it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I cannot call this place a top cheesesteak place compared to Westtown Meat Market in West Chester, or Sonny's Famous Steaks downtown.

Since John's is a long way from Old City, but only 8 miles from Westtown Meat Market, they are a 3-star cheesesteak in our book.

John's staff was very friendly, but not very accurate about the wait.  We were on our way to Lancaster the day we stopped in and asked if it would be a long wait (the place was PACKED that day), because we had to keep to our schedule and we'd just try them another time if needed.  They seemed very understanding about it and we were assured it would be no more than 10 minutes... but it was over 16 minutes.  When you're fighting traffic on 30 to get to Lancaster, that is frustrating.  Otherwise, the service was kind and helpful.

The food was decent.  We particularly appreciated the vent-holes they cut into the container with our fries, because it allowed the steam to escape and allow our fries to stay crispy, which is a nice touch that few other places bother to consider."}
{"text":"Born and raised in south philly and this is the ABSOLUTE BEST cheesesteak I have ever had!!! The pizza looks amazing I will try that next!! And the staff is SUPER friendly! BYOB too"}
{"text":"Have not been in the area in ages, and alot has changed but not John's. You still get treated like a member of the family, and are served some of the best food you've ever had!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place due to the reviews. Got the cheesesteaks and pizza and was fairly disappointed. At best, it was average. The place was packed with people so service was slow."}
{"text":"Damn this place actually has great pizza. And it's BYOB. She don't look like much from the street but they've got the sauce. Love it."}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of of the other reviewers.   I went here with my wife the other day for lunch and the cheese steak was really amazing.   I do consider myself to be a snob when it comes to cheese steaks so i have to say this was quite good.   The meat was chopped up nicely, the portion was great and the cheese was a perfect melt of goo, and wonderfulness.  

I went here and got a cheese steak and fries and gave it 4 stars....I highly recommend you do the same.   For the more hungry eater they also have a large cheese steak which was perfect for the moose (me).   Thinking about this more, it was amazing.....go here get a cheese steak, ignore the yelling of the owners and the mold/asbestos on the ceiling and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Thank you Nicole for being the best waitress and the only employee that actually cares about this place.  She's always very nice and apologetic about the poor work ethics from the rest of the staff here.  If it wasn't for Nicole, this place would've closed a long time ago!!!  The owner here....he's a whole another story....very foul-mouthed and bad tempered (extreme understatement) is all I can say.  Four stars for Nicole, yummy cheesesteaks and cold hoagie sandwiches.  Zero stars for everything else about this place....

I phone ahead my order and take out now, the service is much faster that way.....!"}
{"text":"The owner is nuts. The service stinks. Last time I was there, the police showed up because two of the owners were fighting with each other. Used to be my goto place. Just stay away. Jacks is across the street.  Same food and the people are nice."}
{"text":"I feel the need to pile on to the cheesesteak love orgy. My pants are down and I firmly have my cheesesteak in my hand...we are ready to party like Brittney Spears with some crystal meth and  a bottle of hair dye. 

I, like many people who go to John's Pizza have never tried their pizza and have no entire to do so. The pizza could be like eating little pieces of heaven and the waste produced magically turns into diamonds but i don't care. Not even a little bit.

I go to Johns for the award winning cheesesteaks and that will be what I have from there until I move, die, or something better comes along...much like I feel about my old lady.  Unlike my old lady these cheesesteaks are actually close to being perfect, and unlike my old lady I never walked in on my John's Cheesesteak being mounted by 6 other cheesesteaks and three more waiting on my couch.

It is a damn good cheesesteak. The large is large. The large has plenty of meat on it. The bread is great. It is large enough to eat and fill you up.  

The bad side...not enough cheese at all. The fried onions are never really fried enough for my taste...and the cardinal sin...every 3 cheesesteaks the meat is slightly over cooked. 

When great, it is great.  When it isn't good, it is still pretty damn good."}
{"text":"(4) ~ very good overall food & service.  Highly recommend their Cheese Steaks, which are my pick for best in the Philly Suburbs;)  And there's plenty of seating inside.

FAVORITE:
** Cheese Steak = (4.25) Very good overall flavor & the Rolls are Fresh & Soft.  Best in Burbs;)

OTHER:
* Plain Pizza = (3.75) Good...Note:  The crust is soft & chewy.
* John's Special Italian Hoagie = (3.5) good
* Fuse Ice Tea(fountain) = (3.5) good
* Old Bay Fries = (3.5) good
* Onion Rings = (3.25) pretty good"}

{"text":"Best Hawaiian Pizza i ever had!
Owner Chris...great fella!


I will come agaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!"}
{"text":"This is the chicken cheese steak I've been looking for in the 'burbs.  No need for me to dream about driving into Philly to Ishkabibbles - John's is the real deal.  Definitely an old school vibe - and everyone who comes in seems to know John and tries to chat him up, rile him up or reminisce with him.  Waiting 10 minutes for my hoagie was definitely an entertaining experience.  And tearing into that hoagie was amazing!"}
{"text":"All you hear about Philly is \"their cheesesteaks are great!\" I moved up from NC earlier this year and found this place (it's near work) and tried it out. This was the first cheesesteak I've had where I've said \"ok I get it now about  actual Philly cheesesteaks.\"

Great food. Every time I've been in there is later in the day so it's not been crowded but I've enjoyed the food immensely and the people there are really nice."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best pizza, cheesesteaks and hoagies I have ever had.  I grew up with John's, and I don't think that I am giving it preferential treatment because it is nostalgic.  John is an old man with an attitude who runs the cash register and is about ten times harsher than the Soup Nazi when he wants to be.  The staff is mostly family and if you get there 5-10 minutes early to pick up your food, you are very likely to hear them fighting.  But, don't get me wrong, THIS, along with the amazing food is what makes John's special.  If for some reason you find yourself in Malvern, do yourself a favor and get something from John's."}
{"text":"Simply the best.....EVERYTHING!!
This place actually ruined my life. Ever since I had a cheesteak here...I have never been the same. I compare them all to John's & I always think the rest are gross, no comparison. I can't eat another cheesteak or hoagie, it has to be John's. John oh John wish you were here."}
{"text":"The Good: AWESOME Flavor, Nice Portion Sizes

The Bad: Crowded, Lack of Staff

Both Good and Bad:  The Help

On the advice of a friend, and serious foodie who works in Malvern, I made the trek into John's Pizza for lunch around 12:30 on a Thursday. To start, the place was mobbed.  Now that's a bit of a \"bad\" because they didn't have the staff to handle the rush (1 pizza cook/cashier, 1 grill cook, and 1 waitress), but at the same time it says to me that they must be doing something right to draw such a crowd.  After about 45 mins the place started to clear out and by 1:30 pm it was a ghost town, so I can understand the extra staff not being needed the whole time, but if it's like that everyday they need to figure out a better system. Those were the only drawbacks on my experience.

Myself, and another guy from work sat at the counter by the grill and each ordered a large cheese steak with fried onions, a large soda, and we split a order of onion rings.  Total cost was $28 ($24 + $4 tip).

While we were waiting for our food the grill cook was making hoagies in front of us and mumbling to himself like a madman drinking Charlie Sheen tiger blood.  The older gentleman that was the pizza cook was either off in space plotting his revenge on the cook or staring down customers, I'm not sure, and it was a little uncomfortable looking for some other guys eating at the counter with their heads down not talking.  The waitress was tossing in comments on occasion to keep things interesting.  Some have talked about bickering and such between the crew, and we didn't get to see that but there was definitely a festering blowup in the making and it was kind of like watching an auto-race waiting for the accident.  I found it entertaining, but like I said it was clean. 

The onion rings came out first and we munched on those while waiting for our steaks.  The nicely cooked rings with real onion inside were pretty good.  About 5 mins later the very well proportioned steaks were served.  I really wasn't expecting anything special but was pleasantly surprised with my first bite.  There is a distinctive flavor to the cheese steak that I couldn't place.  Is it the steak, the cheese, or maybe the yellow stuff in the bottle (see the pic of the cook) that is sprayed on each steak as it finishes cooking?  It might as well have been Ambrosia, because each bite of the cheese steak squirted forth with that flavor and my taste buds were in heaven.

I'm not sure where to place this steak in my list.  Maybe #2 behind Mamma's in Bala Cynwyd but maybe #1.  I can't give this place a 5 (it wasn't a perfect experience), but think of it as a 4.5 and rounded down.  All in all an excellent lunch that will have to be repeated again and again!"}
{"text":"I would always drive by John's Pizza on the way to and from work. I was curious about this place because I would see a lot of cars during lunch. After looking the place up on Yelp, I decided to give it a try since it had a lot of good reviews. I tried the Cheese steak chicken with onions and mushrooms. It was delicious. The two ladies working at the place were nice. I didn't notice the employees arguing or screaming at each other like the other reviewers. They have some video games inside and plenty of tables."}
{"text":"I grew up eating John's pizza and its the best in the area - hands down!!! The cheesesteaks & hoagies are really good too..."}
{"text":"Awesome cheesesteaks and I am not a huge fan of cheesesteaks. I like them but do not get the craze over them. However mine here was amazing. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive from Baltimore!  Meat stacked heavily on the 12\" kaiser roll.  The bread was fantastic and the steak was cooked perfectly.  We also had a pizza which was rather tasty.  5 star service to match the cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Their cheese steak hits the spot! The rolls were crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. The beef was well seasoned and cheese was not at all the yellow cheese wiz kind. John's Pizza used white cheese and it created a creamy texture combined with the tender beef. Also ordered fries which came out crispy and hot! This is a BYOB place so we enjoyed the sandwich with a Mike's Harder."}
{"text":"This is the real deal when it comes to a cheesesteak!  I have had tony Luke's and his is dry compared to johns pizza.  They get their meat fresh every two days and use top of the line steak so you don't need as much oil so if is a greasy ball of cheese whiz you seek this is the wrong place.  However if you want a roll that was baked fresh that day with the best ingredients and real creamy American cheese melted everywhere you have then chosen wisely!  Also try their pizza the dough and sauce is made on site and I prefer it to some of the top pies in NYC.  Check out my pictures and thanks Chris for making me a believer in the almighty cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"I was assured that John's would offer me a quality Philly cheesesteak. My co-worker comes here all the time while traveling for business, and raves about it. Being from AZ, I'd never actually had a Philly cheesesteak while in the state of PA, so I had high hopes. Honestly, I've had better cheesesteaks at Charlie's (the chain restaurant). I feel awful saying that about this mom and pop shop, but I could barely find the cheese, and the steak had no flavor. The pizza we ordered was also soggy and flavorless. Sorry."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Always get take out here and have been going since I was a kid. The quality of never, ever changes, and that's a good thing. It's very consistent. Recommend Johns Special (best hoagie you'll have), cheesesteak (on par and maybe better than the 'name' Philly places), and the pizza. Want to try the pizza steak next. 

BTW, I always use the 'Soup Nazi\" rules. Always have money ready, no BSing. The same folks have been working there since I was a kid and sometimes they have 'colorful' arguments. To me, it adds to the charm."}
