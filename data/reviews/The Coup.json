{"text":"The four of us checked this place out, on a recent trip to Calgary, for the ScotiaBank marathon and wow!  ...We all (even the two meat-eating hubbies) enjoyed it.  ...Had great food and service and the place was hoppin'!
I'd wish we'd returned for a second round after a disappointing, not to mention expen$ive experience at the River Cafe in Prince Island Park.  The setting was beautiful at River Cafe, but super-dissatisfying for a vegetarian.  ...If we ever visit Calgary again I'll for sure head back to The Coup!"}
{"text":"The Coup used to be Calgary's best restaurant and my all time fave. Since expansion it's really loud, chrome and glass, super crammed in, terrible service. Most heartbreaking slide ever, went today and it was positively terrible. We left before ordering, the noise was deafening."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on the weekend with my boyfriend and it was delicious!! it was a nice calm place to be during the snowstorm and service was awesome"}
{"text":"You have to get the ramen (I think it's called rhymin and ramen) and the peanut satay bowl! Omg amazing. They have really delicious drinks too, alcoholic and non alcoholic"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. My first trip was a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch. We arrived around 10, and were seated right away (for brunch! on 17th Avenue!)

The service was quite good, however the kitchen messed up our order but caught the mistake before sending out our food. It made for an extra-long wait, but all 3 of us agreed it was totally worth it.

I had the waffle with cashew cream and it was absolutely incredible.  I'm not a vegasn (or even vegetarian for that matter), but I am definitely going to make it one of my regular haunts. Superb. 

P.S. Try coconut milk in your coffee. OMG."}
{"text":"The Coup has been a favourite restaurant since the day it opened, and I try to visit at least once a month. I was very excited to hear they were renovating last year, and the dream of hosting my wedding rehearsal dinner (and therefore, subjecting all of my friends and family to a strictly vegetarian meal!) became a reality. 

The servers are always pleasant, and while the food sometimes takes longer than expected, it is always delicious. I love sharing the sangria, and the thai pizza is amazing. 

The seating can sometimes be a little cramped between tables, and the music sometimes too loud to hold decent conversations around the table, but I don't let that deter me!"}
{"text":"I'm in a giving mood these days - handing out 5 stars all over the place! Well deserved stars though, and The Coup is no exception. It's not just that they use as much organic and local food as possible, or that they make everything from scratch. Or even the fact that they plant trees to offset their waste or recycle & compost everything they can. All of this green effort is deserving in itself. 

But the food! I have personally never had a bland meal at The Coup; everything has been fresh and fantastic.  I really appreciate how The Coup does not try to hide behind wannabe meat dishes and too much salt, sauce, etc.  The food is a celebration of what the earth has to offer and how delicious whole foods naturally are.  I love leaving a restaurant feeling healthy and satisfied. 

As you may have heard about The Coup, it can be a lengthy wait as it is pretty popular. The good thing about the wait is that you can sit in the lounge and have a drink and appetizers, which sure beats sitting around in a lobby waiting for a table. I only with they'd knock the drink & starter prices down a bit, I see no need for them to cost as much as your meal. I often end up drinking water because I can't justify prices of even the nonalcoholic drinks. The mains, however, are very reasonably priced. 

Despite the prices of the aforementioned items, I would 100% recommend The Coup to those who like fresh, quality, healthy food with flavour!"}
{"text":"Calgary is limited when it comes to vegan restaurants. This place is alright.  The service is awesome as the staff make sure that you are happy from the moment you arrive to when you leave.  Service is top notch.  Food is hit and miss. Some dishes are great like the Beet Nuts, Lemon Square for dessert, Little bean Appetizer and Greek Goddess.  Was not a fan of the Dragon Bowl, Hot Pot or their signature cocktails.  I've had great vegan and vegetarian and if this place were in LA, NYC or Vancouver, it would be out of business fast."}
{"text":"Coup De Grace - Who would've thought you could have such high quality and well prepared vegetarian fare in the meat locker of Calgary? The menu offers a nice variety of selections, even with deference to celiacs. Their paradigm of sourcing locally and organically should be applauded, and their philosophy of contributing back to the community is tremendous. Extraordinarily lengthy, creative, and  extensive drink menu. Cashews in the patty of the veggie burger; incredibly tasty! I suppose it's a function of its success and popularity, but it's not easy to get a table and, at times, the food is a little slow coming out of the kitchen. The wait, however, is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great spot! We went there for dinner tonight. Right away, the server came by with water and let us know what the special was. I hemmed and hawed over the menu for a while (so many amazing sounding dishes!) but I ultimately got an Iggy Pop to drink and the Komodo salad. 

The Iggy Pop was great! It's an elderberry drink and I just loved it. Very well mixed and just awesome. I probably could've had 10. The Komodo salad is a new favorite! The shredded carrots, cucumbers and greens were all very fresh. I have two points to make about this salad - number one, the tempeh croutons are great and number two, the dressing is maybe the best dressing of all time. I find tempeh very intimidating... Fermented soy honestly doesn't sound that yummy to me. However, the tempeh croutons are DELICIOUS. They are crispy on the outside and tender and delicious on the inside, with just the perfect amount of spice to make them zing. Now, let me tell you about that dressing. It's a spicy, creamy, almond dressing and it is just incredible. I could probably drink a glass of it. I could spread it on toast. I could dip french fries into it. Or pour it over anything. It is the best. I was very happy with this salad.

The only thing was the dessert. I had an ice cream sandwich and the Coup loses a point for it. The gelato was great, but the cookies were dry and tasted like beets. I like beets as much as the next person, but the cookies were kinda just like chalky beets. I've had baking that had incorporated beets without tasting only like beets, so you know, this could have been less beet-y, but the gelato was great! I would just get a different dessert next time."}
{"text":"As a 20 year vegetarian, I've been to many vegetarian restaurants.  The Coup is absolutely one of the best I have ever had the good fortune to visit!  Service by Kendal was wonderful, restaurant design is chic and modern, food is out of this world delicious!  We started with the Cajun Tempeh Sticks as our appetizer=scrumptious!  I love the Vietnamese Bahn Mi type sandwich, so was excited to see The Coup version called the \"Bun-Me\" which was amazing!  Dinner was topped off with a Lemon Cashew Coconut Square dessert-yummy!  Dinner at The Coup is an event!  I savored every moment and every morsel!"}
{"text":"Still loving this place. Been multiple times since they renovated and I think they just keep getting better. Food is incredible, even for non-veg friends. So fresh, delicious, great options. Service is stellar. Great atmosphere. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Good times here! Low flow ambience, good appetizers. Greek goddess is my default entree. Trust the daily specials -- they're overlooked. Plus, the ladies are as hot as they are smart. Yum."}
{"text":"My friend suggested meeting up at The Coup for a midweek \"business lunch.\"  

As usual, I did some recon, and checked out the Yelp! reviews to get a sense of what to expect.  

After doing so, it sounded like meeting here for lunch during the work week might prove overly optimistic.  There were many comments about limited seating and long table wait times.   That's not what I'm looking for when trying to avoid my co-workers eye-rolling when returning from lunch \"sometime\" in the afternoon.

Well, I'm happy to report, I was pleasantly surprised.

We got there around 12:15--not a confidence inspiring time to begin with- and indeed the place was fully occupied.  One more group was waiting ahead of us.

Our first thought was \"Good luck - everyone just got here, so the whole hour will be shot.\"

Not so.  The turnover was decent, with some people already finishing lunch.  The wait was roughly 10 minutes.  We were then seated by a very pleasant waitress, who continued to impress the whole meal.

I'm not a vegetarian... I'm not \"anything\" per say when it comes to food, other than I generally try to eat food that is:  a) delicious, and b) will not kill me prematurely. 

That being said, just because a meal lacks animal muscle does not mean it's \"good for you.\"  There are plenty of fat-laden, heart-stopping vegetarian dishes served in restaurants.  

Here?  Maybe one or two (see the brie / caramelized onion Panini), but overall, pretty decent choices for a healthy lunch.

I opted for the frittata and a salad.  

The overall portion size was perfect for lunch, and flavor-wise quite satisfying.  I appreciated the frittata being complemented by chunks of sweet yam to mix it up a bit, while adding some contrast.  Where other restaurants may have loaded it up with sodium to make it taste good, here they opted for more diverse and healthy flavors.  Some may call that bland, I call it intelligent.

The service was great, from the moment I walked in the door.  It was attentive, without being annoying (after all, this was a \"business lunch,\" and there were things we needed to discuss).   The smaller size of the restaurant also made it more conducive to conversation.

Will I go back?  For sure.  It's now on my list for places to return."}
{"text":"Yum. 5 stars. We went in for brunch on a weekend but they serve the regular lunch (maybe even dinner) menu at the same time, I believe. I ordered a delicious salad with pickles, feta, crumbled falafel and banana peppers and an amazing tahini dressing- it was really, really good. My 3 dining partners were all raving about their dishes as well. The cocktail & drink list is huge and they all looked so so special and creative. They serve Vietnamese coffee with coconut milk dulce!! Yum. Service was great, atmosphere was amazing. Go!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Gluten free options available."}
{"text":"There was a nice variety of items on the Coup's menu, which was nice for a specialty restaurant. Items such as 'Pseudo Sushi' and 'Mushroom Faux Gras Cigars' are very creative creations and refreshing to see on the menu.

Two of each of the following were ordered: Dragon Bowls & Bun-Me Vietnamese-inspired subs; one of each the Caribbean BBQ and Thai Pizza's; and a King of Kale salad with egg & avocado. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their meal. I myself ordered the Bun-Me Vietnamese-inspired sub, it could have been spicier but it was still tasty. My wife ordered the Dragon Bowl with easy sauce & it was so good with the peanut sauce.

All in all, it was a good experience. We give it a 4 out of 5 only because reservation is very limited, with only certain times available for reservation due to the size of the restaurant. Aside from that, we will for sure be eating there again."}
{"text":"One of the only vegetarian and vegan spots in the city. I eat here often, so I've pretty much had every item on the menu. The HotPot and the new BBQ Jerk Cauliflower Pizza are my favourite.. Followed by the Falafel Quesadilla and Bun Me sandwhich. The yam fries with Miso gravy and pseudo sushi are tasty starters as well. I also try to have the specials as much as possible to try new things!  The service can be slow at times, but the staff is always friendly, the food tasty and the cocktails delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants of any kind in Calgary. I have tried almost the entire menu and loved every item. The features, drinks, brunch, lunch, and dinner are always amazing. It is a little pricey but I feel that the value of the food reflects it and I never regret paying to eat here. The service is fun and laid back and the atmosphere is sophisticated semi-casual. I was a vegetarian for several years which made this my favourite but for herbivores and meat-eaters alike this is a great restaurant! I won't stop coming ever!"}
{"text":"I have a vegetarian restaurant to come to next time I'm in Calgary. Great menu, wonderful staff and service!! My meal was amazing.  Flavour packet in!!!! 
I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian dishes. Good choices and healthy preparations. Nice ambience for family and neat rates. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Love the new space, now that renos are complete. It's a cozy mix of mid century/ 70's with just a hint of cat lady-esque macrame touches to make it feel homey. 
It's been so long since I've visited and so there have been a decent amount of changes to the menu. If you order the pizza like I did, keep in mind it's gigantic. Two people could share this and add an app to make it a meal. Who knew curried cauliflower, light cheese and cashew pesto on a gluten free crust, would take me down so easily? Well, almost took me down. Managed to squeeze in a scoop of the strawberry/ rhubarb sorbet afterwards.  ( dessert pocket) It was refreshing to the palate after the curry. Creamy without the dairy upset one can get from regular ice cream. 
Shared a pitcher of sangria, which could have had a bit more wine as I like my sangria strong, but for $16, it's the best bet for your dollar and in my humble opinion, king of the summer drinks."}
{"text":"To be honest, the dinner that I had here was quite good (the satay bowl with spicy almond sauce), but it is not deserving of 5 stars. The dessert I had definitely earns 5 stars (lemon cashew coconut square), but I am primarily giving this place 5 stars because the atmosphere far surpasses anywhere I have ever eaten. The staff here were beyond amazing. It seemed like they cared about the well-being of everyone rather than just worrying about the quality of their service. I have never experienced an ambiance like this at a restaurant before. I didn't even realize it was noisy inside until I was almost finished my dinner because I was so at peace!

Additional good point: They provided blankets to those sitting outside on the patio.

I only had the opportunity to eat here once, but it was such a wonderful experience that I would recommend that anyone that visits Calgary must try the Coup."}
{"text":"we stopped here for appetizers on our way to a show and the menu blew us away.  it's a vegetarian's dream to see all of these options.  the only sad part was that we only had time for one starter and then had to go.  can't wait to go back and have some of these entrees.  they all look amazing!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to eat in this city. I crave the food here everyday and they are a huge reason why I have chosen to cut chicken, beef and pork from my diet. Slowly I am making my way to full vegetarianism. 

Dalia and Tabitha - you are Food Goddesses! Thank you for your amazing cuisine.

Like their cooking? Buy their recipe book. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"First time coming here with a friend and it was a shit experience. We had no clue it wasn't self serve so we just sat at an open table. One of the waiters there said something along the lines, \"You do know this isn't self serve so you can't just find yourself a table.\". Again, this was our FIRST time coming so we had no clue. 

I ordered a cappuccino and when it came, it was fucking disgusting. Bitter as fuck, no taste to it at all. It seemed like it was poorly done. My friend also got a hot drink and hers was very bitter and had no taste to it at all. We asked for sugar so we could add more flavour to it and the waiter rudely and sarcastically asked \"Have you even had a cappuccino before?\" Complete waste of money.  

Never coming to this place again. I'd recommend going to Heart's Choices. That is the best veg restaurant I have ever been to in Calgary and atleast people there are warm and welcome. :-)"}
{"text":"Whenever I go back to Cowtown, and my people ask me what I want to do while there - going here is one of the top places on my list. I love everything about this restaurant - the decor, the food, the fresh veggie drinks, the chai, the music, the service.  Everything on the menu I have ever had was a hit with me.  What more do you need?

Once, when I went temporarily insane and did a 3 week cleanse, this was the ONLY place that was able to accommodate my very very (very) limited food choices - and worked hard to make it taste fantastic. The Coup was the silver lining to a dark cloud, if you will."}
{"text":"So good your health resistant friends won't notice you're at a vegan restaurant. 

Everything I've had here is absolutely delicious...the salads are creative and refreshing, the bowls are fabulous - and holy cow, order dessert. The affogato is phenom with coconut gelato and I've seriously never had anything as tasty as the peanut butter banana oatmeal ice cream sandwich.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great lunch. We shared the soup of the day, lental soup. Seemed like a dip more than a soup to my companion, however ì enjoyed it the way it was. We also enjoyed the falafel quesadilla. This is a place to return for mor enjoyable food.

Little Bird"}
{"text":"I waver between 3 and 4 stars here. On one hand, I LOVE the food. it is delicious, flavorful and the perfect fulfillment of my freakish veggie cravings when I'm tired of the average meat-centric diet of Calgarians. 

On the other hand, service seems to be a bit of a mixed bag and the hippy-dippy attitudes, while endearing and mostly cheerful, seems to turn into condescension pretty quickly at times. Did I bring my own dishes for take out? No, if I had containers with me, they would probably have been filled with food from home and I wouldn't want to pick up some eats on my lunch break. You're wearing corporately manufactured clothing? I shall give you dirty looks.

This isn't to say that everyone who works here is like that, at all, in fact I've had lovely experiences with some of the servers. Like I said, it seems to be a mixed bag. 

The deliciousness of the food is enough to keep me coming back, and from my experiences is a total must for any vegetarians or vegans out there. Maybe I'll have an updated review in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, so I always like to scope out a city's vegetarian restaurants when I first arrive.  The Coup seems to be Calgary's best-known vegetarian place, so it was high on my list of Must Eats!  Unfortunately, I found both of my meals there to be real letdowns.  

Both times I've eaten at The Coup I've had Mexican-inspired dishes: once a \"taco\" and another time \"huevos rancheros\".  I use quotations marks as the terms really must be used loosely- both dishes were extreme distant cousins of their namesakes.  I found the taco to be overly heavy on crunchy chard stems, and strongly lacking seasoning.  I found the huevos rancheros to be dull and uninteresting, with an overly earthy flavor from the sprouted-grain tortilla.  Both dishes lacked seasoning, where all it would have taken was some fresh cilantro and a splash of lime juice to make the dishes passable.  Without that fresh flavour, both dishes were nearly bad enough to warrant being sent back.

I just checked The Coup's website and it doesn't look like much (if anything) has changed since my first visit there a few years ago (my second visit was in the past year).  I definitely will not be returning until I see evidence of innovation on the menu.  There are way too many other restaurants with great vegetarian options in town."}
{"text":"A vegetarian and vegan heaven!  Amazing food, great atmosphere and delicious drink specials (the peach Bellini is divine!). The decor is beautiful, very boho, hippie chic. I especially appreciated the herbs growing on the wall.  If you are a vegetarian or just wanting some tasty food this restaurant is the place to go on 17th street"}
{"text":"For us, the Coup is among an exclusive few favourite restaurants for great food at reasonable prices. Trendy meets sustainable at this dining and cocktails favourite on 17th.  Tasty, creative vegetarian dishes tend to celebrate fresh, mostly local, largely organic produce rather than trying to imitate meat.  (That said, the freshly made Upstream Burger is among the most popular items at the Coup.)  Atmostphere and service are pleasant, comfortable, and friendly, and the food is truly terrific.  Our favourites include the Greek Goddess, Magic Dragon Bowl, and all the salads.  The salads serves as a very satisfying meal large enough to feed two small people.  The commitment to environmental sustainability here is impressive, though largely invisible to the customer.  They are very careful about sourcing, using locally grown and minimally packaged produce, rennet-free cheeses, GMO-free grains.  They have their own beehives, and use their own compost in their garden.  The place is 100% wind powered, and even uses recycled paper for the menus and vitamin C transfer receipts.  They also support Tree-Canada (planting 36 trees a month) and Meal Share (thousands of meals provided).  No reservations except for larger groups, but you can count on getting a table right away if you arrive by 5:30 - about the right time for dinner before a downtown show."}
{"text":"The Coup is always a pleasure! 

From working there, to dj'ing there to eating and sleeping there LOL. I tell as many as I can about this wonderful little treasure in the heart of cow town ... and I am excited to check out the new lounge that they recently opened... \"Big Props\" to you girls and love!

\m/^.^\m/"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever enjoyed a salad in a restaurant - definitely the best veggie experience I've had in this city. Outstanding veggie and vegan cuisine. Wonderful service."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp Readers,

Always walk by this place as it is close to my apartment, have tried to eat there in the past but since they don't take reservations it always has a wait and now I see why.

This place is awesome. Went there to eat dinner on a Sunday night, had a few drinks in their lounge first, which has a cool atmosphere and is very comfortable. 

There staff is very helpful and quite attractive (if your into that sort of thing). Also there food was awesome. I had the fettuccine special myself which was cooked perfectly while my companion had the Dragon bowl, which I will be ordering the next time I go.

Cool Vibe
HOT and friendly staff
Great food
Only 1 really bohemian looking fellow.

WIN WIN.

Thanks."}
{"text":"It's nice to go to a nice spot with good healthy options.  I love the coconut chai latte too.  Yum"}
{"text":"I've been vegan for over ten years, and when people tell me they don't like \"vegan food\" I wonder what the hell they're talking about. They're talking about the coup.

I ordered a \"satay\" bowl with a brass monkey like beer cocktail and my boyfriend had the tempeh reuben.

My satay bowl was basically liquid peanut butter on steamed veggies (wonder where they're sourcing that \"local\" lotus root). I was brought half a glass of orange juice for my drink, but a full beer. When I asked for the rest of my juice to finish off my cocktail I was told it would be $4. For a $8 drink I would expect to get at least. . . well, all of it. 

My boyfriend's reuben had to be sent back. He enquired about substituting vegan cheese for \"organic sheep's feta\" but was told again that he would be charged. Fine. Be that way, but don't glob 3/4 of a cup of  \"vegan mayonnaise\" on to compensate. When it returned, he realized that there was initially too much sauce, but it was also so unappetizing that reducing the amount of dressing didn't save his meal. The \"tomato horseradish aioli\" was more like seafood cocktail sauce with whipped canola oil product. 

The service is okay, if you're dressed right. I noticed a HUGE difference between how we (sort of hipsterish looking, tattooed young couple) were treated (seated more quickly, chatted up by servers etc) than the meat and potatoes looking Albertans. That just isn't cool.

So no, I don't recommend the coup. The food is bad and the service is meh. Stay home and make a meal instead."}
{"text":"*Really* good vegetarian and vegan fare, plus great service and atmosphere.  Had 2 meals here in 2 days and if we weren't flying out tomorrow would make it 3 for 3!

For brunch my husband and I had (1) french toast with whole grain bread and maple syrup, which was super tasty and french-toasty yet somehow light; (2) \"treehouse\" sandwich, a vegefied club sandwich with smoked tofu, lettuce, tomato, optional cheese & pesto aioli on rye which was thoroughly satisfying; and (3) rainbow greens salad with sunflower sprouts, shredded carrots & beets and seeds with a tahini lemon garlic dressing,  The salad was perfectly balanced, with the sprouts, shreds, and toasted seeds providing texture and crunch and the slightly tart dressing bringing the whole alive.

For dinner the next day we encored the rainbow salad as a starter; I had a glass of rose which complemented the salad perfectly.  Then we each ordered a \"magic bowl\" - though it's listed as one menu item, in addition to steamed/sauteed vegetables you have a choice of 3 proteins (tofu, lentils or chickpeas), 2 grains (brown rice or quinoa), and 4 dressings, so the two dishes we received were actually quite different and both delicious.  The peanut satay dressing is particularly yummy, and my husband's green curry was also very good with a hit of fresh ginger.

The service is prompt, friendly, totally unpretentious, and solicitous without being intrusive.  The atmosphere is hip and upbeat without being annoyingly \"hipster,\" there's lively tasteful music in the background, and the space is relaxing and aesthetically pleasing with plenty of wood and earth tones accented with splashes of color.

Basically, this place makes you feel comfortable and taken care of, and when you're eating you're thinking \"damn this food is good\"  and you're conscious of a feeling of well-being.  And when you leave, even if you've eaten your fill and then some, you feel refreshed and energized.  I'm a vegetarian who loves to eat out and this is one of the best vegetarian restaurants I've experienced!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Coup a couple of times. First time was for my friend's birthday. It took a while for us to get drinks, but food came out in a timely manner. I had the Beachfront Hot Pot, and it was delicious. A nice, light dish with a lovely flavor from the coconut and lime broth. They also brought a complimentary sorbet for my friend for her birthday, which was really sweet of them to do.
The second time I came here, we arrived shortly after it opened for dinner service. It was about a quarter full, so we got in right away. It started getting busier, but service remained attentive. We got the Warm Goat Cheese Dip and Baked Rosemary Yam Fries to start. The Goat Cheese Dip was to die for!!! So so good. The Yam Fries were also excellent, and I loved the Garlic Aioli that came with them. I got the Noodles of Contribution, which were so yummy. The jalapeno pesto had a nice kick to it, but wasn't overly spicy which I liked. The pumpkin seeds gave some crunch, and the portion was extremely generous.
Overall, I am glad I discovered this gem. I am not a vegetarian, so I was skeptical about coming here. But my close friend and my brother are vegetarians, and both loved this place. So, I'm glad I opened my mind up to different cuisine, and I can definitely say I will be returning once they finish their renos."}
{"text":"Food was good. Awful service. Got seated in the back close to the kitchen, sardines with other people in a very crowded fashion WHILE there were plenty of other nice open window seats available. This is stupid to not let people pick where they want to sit when you don't allow for reservations. Was hot, crowded and loud. Lastly server got two of our drink orders wrong."}
{"text":"I love Coup what more can I say. I'm not a vegetarian but everything on the menu is completely delicious and makes me wish I was. I've never had a bad thing and the atmosphere and the service are always great. Try the Greek Goddess it is to die for! I wake up dreaming about it and actually bought the Coup's cookbook just so I could make this dish. It's still nice to be able to walk down the street and have it ready-made & waiting for me though."}
{"text":"the food was pretty good (4). the service was PAINFULLY SLOW (2) however I agree with everyone else that this is a nice addition to the calgary vegetarian scene, not that I'm vegetarian, but it's nice to try something else for a change!"}
{"text":"If you want to get an idea of the character of this place, here's a hint: We went there on the first Saturday evening of Stampede, and there wasn't a single cowboy hat to be seen!  Surely the same can't be said of any other restaurant on 17th Ave :)

This restaurant is low key and hip, with the vibe of a cafe but a great full vegetarian menu.  The food is fresh and creative and unlike other restaurants doesn't rely too heavily on vegetarian renditions of meat dishes.

The yam fries are simply delicious and even better when combined with the tzatziki sauce.  The main courses are enormous (much bigger than they look!) and reasonably priced.  My quinoa and tofu dragon bowl was full of fresh, delicious vegetables and topped with a rich, thick peanut sauce. The portion was so large that I didn't come anywhere close to scraping the bottom of the bowl before I was full.  

Bonus props to the restaurant's reliance on green energy, use of local and organic ingredients, and support of local artists as well.  Suffice it to say, The Coup is a gem I didn't expect to find on 17th Ave!"}
{"text":"We were turned on to The Coup by some cool Calgary kids and it did not disappoint. Really friendly staff and super yummy food. If you are a looking for great vegetarian fare in Calgary, this is your go-to place."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong here! I always leave stuffed but not so-stuffed-I-never-want-to-eat-again-stuffed since the food is so light and not fried. You MUST MUST MUST have the hummus. Calgary needs great vegan restaurants and the staff here is super knowledgeable about all different dietary concerns (gluten-free, vegan, etc). Totally worth the wait at breakfast, lunch or dinner - that said get there early - the smell will get your stomach growling!"}
{"text":"Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed by The Coup.  I was really looking forward to eating there, and while nothing was bad, nothing was great either.  Three of us dined together.  We started with the 'field trip', which is a bit of salad with 4 diff dips/spreads and cuc and flatbread for dipping.  Was overall pretty good, but the one spread was super salty and I didn't think there was quite enough flatbread for the amount of spreads.  It was very filling appy though, in fact I could not eat much of my main after munching away on a fair bit of it.  
I had the 'upstream burger' with soup for din.  I didn't care much for the soup.  As for the burger, the patty was more like the texture of a pate.  When I squished the burger together to eat it, the 'patty' completely disintegrated and spread out.  I didn't mind that, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting from a burger.  It was good, but again, not great.  That was also the sentiment of my dining companions, who ordered the 'falafel quesadillas' (though there was too much feta, as that completely dominated the taste of the quesadilla) and 'dijon de sean' pasta (was not all that fond of this dish overall).  
For a drink, I had the bergamot lemon thyme iced tea, which was delish, though I thought it was overpriced at $5.25.  I mean come on, my dining companions got beers which were about $1 more and were a fair bit larger than my iced tea.  
I certainly wouldn't refuse to return, but I won't be hurrying back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Went with my parents and they both loved it as well. The people were very nice and helpful and of course the food was amazing. I can't wait to try breakfast here!"}
{"text":"The only reason it isn't 5 star is honestly the price. The portion size and taste are quite remarkable. I got the savoury mushroom, it was basically a waffle with mushrooms on top. Sounds strange but it was delicious. It got very busy, but that's understandable. I did like that they had vegan and non vegan choices as 2 of the 4 people in our party were not vegan so it was very inclusive."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The atmosphere was great, dim but not dark and just crowded enough to be full but intimate. The volume was perfect for conversation with just enough ambient noise for privacy.
We had the mushroom \"cigars\" with truffle honey  as an appetizer and were very pleased with them. They were smallish filo pastry rolls which were tasty but not heavy. The truffle honey added a ton of depth. 
We split a Thai pizza as a main. It was smoked cheddar and tofu with carrots and a peanut satay sauce base. Our excellent server suggested we hold on the the truffle honey to drizzle a little on the pizza and it was great advice. 
While the portions were modest, a starter and a main split two ways was pleasantly filling. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant has been a hallmark in vegetarian community in Calgary.  Food is good, the new renovations and decor is a needed improvement from the old bar area.  I like how the restaurant sources its food from as many local farmers as possible. I enjoy the classic coup appetizer, the meso gravy yam fries.  A bit on the pricey end but worth it."}
{"text":"I'm no vegetarian, in fact, if anything I'm a meatatarian. I love meat, meat makes me very happy, my jaw drops open every time I come home for dinner and meat is the main dish, it's so tasty! Need I say more? 

I couldn't believe I left this place happy, satisfied and full, given there wasn't a trace of meat in my dinner. Loved the vibe of the place, the friendly service, and their Greek Goddess was really yummy (if you're an olive fan, like me). My friend, also a meat lover (guys generally love their meat), got the upstream burger, which he also enjoyed, much to his surprise. 

The downside? Before my flight back to Toronto, my cousin and aunt decided to treat me to lunch here after hearing me rave about the place. Unfortunately we could not stay because there weren't enough seats for us (3 adults and 2 kids), there's only one group seating area, which was quite unfortunate, but I had such a great experience there that I decided to get the green house effect salad to go (which I ate on my plane ride home hehe).  I meant to get the Greek Goddess but it was not available at the time so the owner suggested The Green House Effect was the closest thing to it. I paid over $11 for a salad that was not very filling at all, but it came in the cutest personally decorated plastic to-go container which for some reason made me very happy..."}
{"text":"what can i say? i still love this place. BEST coconut chai in the city bar none!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Probably my favourite restaurant where I can actually eat things without feeling restricted since I don't eat meat"}
{"text":"This place should be 4.5 stars, so I'm trying to get it up there.

I had seen this place on here and decided to give it a try.  Came in and sat at the bar and was greeted by Jeff, the bartender.  I asked for his recommendation on a drink: spot on.  Asked his recommendation for food (the bun-me and chipotle black bean and chocolate soup): spot. on. 

I'll definitely go back and ask for more recommendations."}
{"text":"I'm usually a carnivore but this restaurant is fantastic. I ordered the curry bowl special and it was to die for."}
{"text":"I found the staff to be arrogant and unaccommodating.  It may be a \"vegan is better\" attitude. While I was there a group of six arrived to celebrate the birthday of one of the twentysomething group, however, the waiter/manager refused to let them move a table for two to adjoin the table for four in the corner near the cash register so they could all be together for this special occasion; the reason given by the waiter/manager was that it would block the usual path to the cash register; so two of the group had to sit apart because the waiter/manager didn't want to walk an additional three steps to get to the cash register; on another occasion, I arrived with a Beano coffee cup in my hand, waited in the entrance while holding and sipping from my Bean coffee cup, then was greeted by a host while I was holding my Beano coffee cup, waited a bit longer, then another host greeted me with my Beano coffee cup and seated me at the DJ table with my Beano coffee cup; then while my Beano coffee cup was on the table, a waitress came and took my lunch order; a few minutes later the young waitress returned, reached across the table and grabbed the Beano coffee cup while barking \"you're not allowed to have outside beverages in here!\"  I was surprised, so I grabbed the Beano coffee cup from her hand and asked \"why are you telling me now, after I have ordered my lunch?  I have had this cup since I arrived!\"  She replied: \"well, I can cancel your order if you want!\"  I said \"that's not a fair solution, why don't you bring me a coffee cup, I will pour the rest of my coffee into the cup and you can charge me for a coffee, I will probably have a re-fill anyway\"; she said she couldn't do that and insisted that I give her the Beano coffee cup; I asked to see a manager; the manager supported the waiter so I asked to speak to an owner since I thought I was being unfairly treated and that my proposed compromise was reasonable; they took the Beano coffee cup, I ate my lunch, the owner called and spoke with me on the phone; she said the staff were enforcing the rules.  I suggested that they could be more accommodating or, at least, inform people as soon as they arrive.  On the way out I checked to see if I had missed a notice that was posted at the entrance saying: \"No outside food or beverages\" and there wasn't one.  So, I called the owner and suggested it might be more fair to post a notice.  If they had told me that outside beverages were prohibited when I arrived, I would have left, finished my coffee and probably returned to have lunch.  (NOTE: other restaurants along 17th Avenue SW allow outside beverages and are accommodating)."}
{"text":"Eating out as a vegetarian in Calgary can be tough. And that's one of the reasons why The Coup is often lined up out the door. The Coup serves up homemade, eclectic vegetarian and vegan options along with alcohol service and fair trade coffee. They sometimes have DJ's spinning from dinner time to after 9:00 but if you don't want to wait then show up early. 
I suggest trying it out and ordering something you have never heard of before, the worst that can happen is you experienced something new!"}
{"text":"I don't have a whole lot to say about the entire menu as I've only eaten here once, and that was for breakfast.  All I can say is that I frequently daydream about those buckwheat crepes with banana coconut butter known as the \"French Canadian\", while being stuck with the knowledge that I live 5 1/2 hours away.  First impression was incredibly strong."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with The Coup's falafel wrap with a side of sweet potato fries... it is just ridiculously delicious... mmm I've tried other things on their menu, but this has become my favourite here. 

Being one of the only vegetarian restaurants I know of in Calgary, I can't really compare it to anything else in town.

With that in mind, what bugs me about this place is it takes forever to eat here on any night of the week. Yes, being busy for the owners is a good thing, but honestly, I am constantly skipping this place because the wait time is just ridiculously... long. My beef with their recent expansion, although it doubles their sq/ft'age here, didn't solve this. The new half is merely a waiting room/lounge - I wish they simply added tables so people wouldn't have to wait so long; its quite sad in my opinion.

I love the falafel wraps and the service here; they have great service btw. Its just the waiting is the problem for me.

They don't take reservations here sadly.

So, if you want some delicious food, come to The Coup, just expect a long wait time especially on the busier nights of the week... which is almost everyday expect Monday because they are closed on Monday.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best Sunday morning breakfast in Calgary (IMO)... Super healthy and tasty, you don't even notice it is vegetarian!

It is also very small. So don't tell those fools waiting in line for a pile of bland at Nelly's, or I will no longer be able to get in..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Overall experience: 4/5

My favorite vegetarian restaurant in Calgary...of course it's the only vegetarian restaurant that I have been to in Calgary but it is the best!  Great hip atmosphere and music.  Even if you don't like vegetarian food, you will enjoy the atmosphere and the interesting people who go there."}
{"text":"So it was my boyfriend and I's first time at The Coup last night and we were super excited to try this place because of the rave reviews. 

When we first got in the girl that sat us down was really kind, told us the drinks of the day, we felt welcomed... well... until we met our server. This tall blonde girl, don't remember her name maybe she didn't even tell us who knows but she had the worse attitude ever didn't even give us any info about the menu. 

When I ordered the upstream burger (which was delicious) I asked her if it was all vegan and she answered \"Yes\" with a very rude tone like I should know? On the menu it specifically tells you to tell the server if you are vegan or have any special requests so why is she acting like I'm an idiot when the menu tells me to tell the server. Maybe you shouldn't be a server if you can't handle a simple question without being rude. Again the MENU tells me to TELL YOU...

My boyfriend ordered the tempeh shawarma, we both tried it and didn't think it was anything special, tasted more like a Korean wrap that needed more flavour. Also a tip: if anyone wants a dipping sauce, they are huge so you can get different sauces and just share. It would have been helpful if our server actually said something especially when we both ordered the same sauce for $2 each. 

When we were finished our meal she finally came back after 20 mins with the dessert menu and to order the dessert we waited an extra 10-15 mins and decided to just take it to go. BTW we were there between 9-10 pm, it wasn't even busy, the rush was gone and what was she doing? just drinking and talking to her coworkers, being rude to her paying customers and not giving a shoot? even my boyfriend was annoyed and he doesn't get mad or annoyed easily. 

Very disappointed with the service, while food was good, will I try this place again? Based on our first experience with the service, no... It confuses me how they have such good reviews, maybe we just went on a bad day and time, having that terrible server which saddens me because I want to try more dishes, but just because of her we don't ever want to go back and have that possibly happening again. It was extremely frustrating and awkward and it wasn't like we were bad or rude customers, in fact we were so polite and even tipped when she clearly did not deserve it and the food was overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My roommate and I try to make a habit of going every Sunday. Even if you're not vegan or vegetarian (like myself) its an excellent spot for lunch, dinner or just cocktails with friends ( I highly recommend the \"fruit of the loom\"!!!). If you're hesitant about trying this spot DON'T BE. Every Sunday I wonder why we didn't start going to Coup years ago. Support local, support organic, support Coup."}
{"text":"I visited The Coup and Meet for my first time last week and I was amazed at how packed the restaurant was.  They don't take reservations, so my girlfriends and I went with the plan that we would have appetizers and cocktails on the Meet side before going over to have dinner on The Coup side!  I had never been to a strictly vegetarian restaurant before, but was pleasantly surprised at the different types of dishes they offered.  The cocktails were great and so was our dinner! Everything was very nicely presented and the service was great! We had a great booth table in the corner which was perfect for a nice girls night out! Overall we all enjoyed our time at Meet and The Coup and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Bland de bättre vegorestaurangerna jag ätit på. Men samtidigt så finns inte riktigt den där charmen man letar efter i ett sånt här ställe. Det är hippt och ett coolt ställe. Ljudvolymen var relativt hög och tillsammans med smutsigt bord kändes inte så välkomnande. Lyckligtvis så räddar maten miljön och det är fortfarande en upplevelse man inte får missa i Calgary."}
{"text":"The food is very unique but the restaurant is very small . When me and my significant other came in for a date the place was super packed making it hard for us to get a table plus it was very chilly outside so we were stuck at the front of the restaurant freezing and squished between larger groups of people. We got seated against a wall next to a large group of people so it was difficult to have a conversation cause the people were so close to us. The food overall was a bit pricy but with fresh food that makes sense. My favourite thing from here is the cauliflower BBQ wings it tastes just like chicken expect healthier. I got a pita wrap which was okay but not amazing the flavours were lacking but the service was really nice , staff are friendly. I would recommend this place if you are vegan because they have all the options for you , only thing to remember is to call in to book a table before hand it gets busy around 5-8pm. In regards to parking they have a 2hr parking lot outside free and there is also parking around 17ave which is free on weekends."}
{"text":"Everyone there is a total hippie. If you're into innovative vegetarian creations, this is the place you gotta eat. Awesome various of classic food with a very vegetarian twist. Drinks are beautiful, had the pesto power pizza, talk about amazing! Overall awesome atmosphere too, can feel like you in a astral paradise."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite vegetarian restaurant in the city! always amazing food, great portions, and great customer service. 
The only setback is that the drinks are a little pricey."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Excellent service, high quality ingredients and simply delicious dishes. I will from this point on be adding cardamom to my hot apple cider :)

Great spot to eat for vegans visiting Calgary and I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"We tried this place on our visit to Calgary. We ordered ramen and veggie hotpot. 

Ramen : so so, and it was not hot  enough, most people prefer to eat ramen on a winter day because it feels good to have something piping hot and yummy, I would pass on ordering this dish next time 

Falafel quesadilla with yam fries : quesadilla was good but yam fries were okay

Veggie hotpot : this was really really good ! That curry / sauce had very nice coconut flavor and lot of veggies ! Presentation was good affagato (espresso with coconut ice cream) and really liked it. Perfecto!

Service : really good 
Ambience : really good 

Would love to come back and try other things , menu looked super promising !"}
{"text":"The coup is the kind of place that makes me want to be a healthier man. I have been about a dozen times and have never necessarily disliked anything. There has been bland moments but for the most part the food was delicious, vegetarian without any pretentious attitude too! You know how sometimes a vegetarian / Yogi / new age oriented person can really look down on you for not sharing lifestyles/ beliefs with them...I didnt get that here. I had brunch on Sunday here, twas great. Smaller portion sizes and thats great because sometimes I need to be reminded of how much I DONT need. The service has always been friendly and unlike certain other patchouli oriented dining experiences ( ehh hemmm NELLIES) I have yet to find any bits of oily dread lock salad on the side of my plate.
I even got drunk here once in the summer and shared 2 giant punch bowls with a friend. We looked quite likely as if we were a homosexual couple enjoying an evening on the town...perhaps before a night out at the thee-a-tah.
But most enjoyable of all was stumbling drunk out the door of a vegetarian spot and having people shoot you scowls as you light a cigarette. whoops.

Namaste"}
{"text":"Really, truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten in my life.  I'm normally a huge fan of vegan and vegetarian food but this meal made me want to go back to eating meat. The entire meal tasted like cardboard cooked in more cardboard and then topped with even more cardboard.  The only saving grace was that our server seemed to genuinely want to make or evening as enjoyable as possible and went out of her way to try to repair the damage to our evening that the food had done.  I understand that when you are cooking vegan food you can be some what limited in your choice of ingredients but even by vegan standards this was pretty tasteless and bland."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favourite restaurants. This restaurant is amazing veg  restaurant with unique Vegan options. We ordered the Vietnamese sub with wild mushrooms and the noodles stirfry. My husband thought the stirfry was a little plain but I loved the Vietnamese sub. We also ordered a veggie juice and the chocolate tarts which were delicious!!! 
I also really appreciate that they have metal vs plastic straws. 
 They don't take reservations except for big parties and it's a very popular place so go early or expect to wait 30 to 60 minutes. They also have a small but nice patio. I would highly recommend this place even if you eat meat"}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian food, friendly service and a good selection of local beers. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Although the food was very good and the restaurant is nice, my one complaint is that for relatively high prices, the meal portions in my opinion are pretty small. You don't really get what you pay for. I could've used more food. 
That being said, it's a nice place and our waitress gave excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"it didn't take long to get a table and then we were \"upgraded\" to the booth around the corner which was super nice! (sitting with the cutest baby ever attracts some attention and well, who likes to sit by an entrance full of people waiting to be seated?) 
our server was hilarious and amazing with details and... most importantly, the food was delicious. hurrah for vegan options in calgary!
i'm excited to finally get to try this place after hearing about it for years. (i am visiting from vancouver)
thanks, coup!"}
{"text":"As a vegan who moved to Vancouver from Calgary as soon as I could (age 18), I never thought I'd find a place as hip and conscious as The Coup in Calgary. I'm so glad this place is here. It's a place I can go for a meal with my friends when I go home to visit my family. It's in a great location and the food, while not cheap, is reasonable and delicious.

I understand the complaints that some people have about The Coup. I guess part of the reason I love it so much is that it's a bastion of food consciousness in the middle of beef-land, so when I visit, I hear angels sing - the food could be half as good and I'd still go.

If memory serves me correctly, the Messy Janes are a delicious breakfast option. I really like the miso gravy they serve at this place. Can't wait for my annual Coup trip this week!"}
{"text":"Generally people assume that vegan food is bland, but that so doesn't have to be the case. Unfortunately, The Coup doesn't give haters any reason to reassess their opinions of vegetarian/vegan fare.

Unlike my favourite vegan restaurant in Toronto called 'Fresh', The Coup IS NOT all that. The food is very bland, the environment is too cozy for my liking and the service isn't anything to write home about.

The Coup had serious potential in my mind when a friend told me about it, but after one visit (which happened to be one visit too many), I've come to the conclusion that unfortunately, it just doesn't deliver on any level."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. We had appetizers in their cozy waiting space with blooming tea, and had a cozy booth in the restaurant where I had the special of vegan mac and cheese. Everything was piping hot and as fresh as can be. I like that they promote eating local and organic while giving a unique vegetarian dining experience."}
{"text":"Love this place for it's creative vegan food. It's cozy in there and it would be great if they had a bigger location. I would be very excellent if they opened a second location in the south."}
{"text":"I had the Dirt Diggler cocktail and immediately went and bought every ingredient it was SO good. Paired with the goddess bowl- filling and fresh. Love the atmosphere, the food, the location, the staff."}
{"text":"Oh.....heaven is here on earth?!  I wasn't sure until I found Coup on a trip to Calgary.  And I have returned for multiple meals every time I am in the city!  

The first time I went was on lunch break from a yoga workshop just down the street.  I was so happy there was a vegetarian place in the area as it makes my veggie life a whole lot easier!  It was a cold 6 block walk, but well worth it.  I had a flowering tea and the Hot Pot which changed my world.  So delicious.  And I think it was the first time I had eaten Lotus Root.  I was craving more so I went back that night and had the Satay Bowl.  Also amazing.  Also filling.  I couldn't finish it all!

A week later I was back in the city with my fiance.  He was also excited about a veggie place that was so close to where we were staying.  We decided to check it out for lunch and he was also very pleased.  I didn't stray too far and I had the Hot Pot again as I had been thinking about it all week.  He had a veggie bowl with falafel and an amazingly tangy dressing.  I only got one bite, but I thought it was great and judging by the time it took to disappear, he also thought it was great.  

I will be back to try more on their amazing menu!  There is enough variety to keep me interested for a while, although that Hot Pot alone is enough to keep me coming back again and again and again and again and...."}
{"text":"This is a good vegetarian restaurant, everything is really fresh and you can feel it  in your mouth.         You get out feeling better.                                                 

So for a feel good meal tasty and healthy this is the place to go in Calgary."}
{"text":"Another trip to Calgary, another trip to The Coup. This time around I ordered the Thai hot pot. (For those interested seasonal veggies in my case meant red and yellow pepper, zucchini, red onion, carrots, snow peas.) Mmmm, I love my veggies!

There is a good variety of things to order at The Coup, and I think that will keep me coming back when I'm in town. Not cheap (more than my work travel allowance), but healthy.


$17.25 with tax and tip"}
{"text":"I think I went in expecting crazy things, and this place gets a 3 because I did not get crazy things! :(

Atmosphere was okay. Once again, expected something a tad bit different.

We ordered the sundried tomato hummus to share.. It was a huge portion with some giant crackers and tasty bread. The bread was great, but the hummus was a tad underwhelming. I like my hummus moist and creamy and garlicky. This one was dry and not really very creamy or garlicky. Ah.

I ordered the Enchanted Stack for my main meal. It was once again... underwhelming. Came with a tiny salad which mainly consisted of greens and something orange on top. The wheat berries in my 'enchanted stack' was some sort of a grain with not much going on in there that interested me. It wasnt bad, but it wasnt something I would order again either. I ate as much as I could and took the rest to go because I hate wasting food. I had bites of my friends' dishes: Greek Goddess and the Dragon Bowl. Both were very good. I think if I visit the Coup again, I would order the Dragon Bowl.

However, I must be impartial here and not give in to the crowd's echoing.. I would be WAY more inclined towards going for the Buddha Bowl at another establishment downtown that does vegetarian fare better, in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"I have been a regular patron of The Coup for almost a decade. I have never been disappointed by the service, food, quality or anything of this restaurant .. in fact, I am always pleased! The Steam Bun nights on Tuesday's are something new to look forward too. Dalia, the owner, is always integrating inspiring new dishes and flavours. I feel like I am in New York or Vancouver when I visit The Coup. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The Coup was the last stop on our poutine crawl during Poutine Week.  I couldn't have the poutine (allergic to the mushroom gravy) so I tried the waffle sushi instead.

The sushi was green onion, pear, and ginger rolled with organic brown rice and grilled on a waffle iron, with a drizzle of ginger teriyaki sauce.  It looked really good and the flavours were nice, especially the hint of ginger.  The roll needed a little more green to brighten the flavour and definitely more sauce.

I do love a good vegetarian restaurant but I hadn't known this place existed until the poutine crawl so I'm looking forward to trying other items on future visits.  There were some pretty crazy things on the drink menu I'd love to try next time too."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner for two on a Sunday. Got a table right away without a reservation. Our server was delightful, charming, and very helpful. All of our food arrived very quickly. 

I am vegan and my companion is an omnivore; we both enjoyed everything we tried on the menu. Our server pointed out what was & could be made vegan for me. 

The drink menu is hefty and exciting. Regretfully, I didn't try anything from it, but was extremely tempted. My companion tried a cocktail, I forget which, but found that near the end the strong herbal flavours were a bit too much for her liking. She enjoyed the first, milder half of the drink, but did not finish the rest of it. 

To start, we shared the Baked Rosemary Yam Fries with Garlic Aioli. No picture of that because we ate it so quickly-- it was delicious, cooked perfectly. 

My companion enjoyed the Midori Tsukemen, which our server let us know was served chilled so not to surprise us. It comes beautifully poured with a bright green sauce, as well as some purple plants on the side. I ordered the Giant Panda. I am a sucker for seitan, so the seitan yakitori excited me. The Giant Panda comes with quite a bit of rice, and though it was delicious, I felt that there could have been a bit more peanut sauce to balance it out (or a bit less rice), and I did mix it around to distribute the flavours. It was not mentioned on the menu but the Giant Panda comes with cilantro, to my delight. Fresh shaved vegetables balanced the heaviness of the seitan and peanut sauce. It is a pretty heavy and filling dish, but quite tasty. 

Though we were pretty full, we entertained the dessert menu, and surrendered to the Flowers, Blossoms, & Petals \"Cheese\" Cake. My companion also ordered the Coconut Berry Fog drink, which arrived with a white heart swirled into its pink froth. I loved the \"cheese\" cake, and we took the rest to go since we were both too stuffed to finish it. I highly recommend trying it. 

Our experience at The Coup was warm, positive, and delicious overall. Quite a bit of the menu can be made vegan or already is. My companion, who does eat meat but is open to try some vegetarian cuisine, very much enjoyed it. I had heard about The Coup a few times from some vegetarian friends, and am very impressed by the food and atmosphere. I will definitely be returning to try some other menu items that piqued my interest (there were many)."}
{"text":"Sweet potato wedges to start - delicious!

My meal was also delicious, and cleanse friendly! I was on the Wild Rose cleanse and was able to find a dish that fit perfectly, and it was delicious. My friend is celiac and vegetarian and they she had no problem either, substituting the penne in her dish for gluten-free pasta. 

Service was great too - our waitress was really helpful with our diet restrictions."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetables for all! Even the meat eaters!

Love everything the do here food wise. Normally it takes only a little while to work out what I feel like ordering but with the menu at Coop I deliberated for a quite a while before making my choice. In fact my boyfriend and I made sure that what the other was ordering was something we wanted to try.

The boy had the Thai Pizza - they use a tortilla shell as the base topped with peanut satay sauce, chili flakes, smoked cheddar cheese, smoked tofu, green onion, black sesame seeds, inca fire salt and scallions. The tortilla shell is lovely and thin and stay crisp through to the middle. They pile the toppings on so even though a tortilla shells sounds like a small meal the toppings get you fill fast.

I had the Chow Mein Unplugged. Noodles with a ton of seasonal veg which also included purple cabbage & kale, delicious garlic-juniper sauce, all topped with applewood smoked oyster mushrooms - amazing! Love these mushrooms. Who thinks to take mushrooms and applewood smoke them? These guys. Applause! Good size portion and filled me up.

Their drink menu is extensive - one page all non-alcholic and different teas, the opposite page all great sounding cocktails.

They dont take reservations but we were told that if you generally arrive around 6pm its not too long of a wait. We were seated next to a couple at a 6-top table so we had some space between us and didn't feel like we were crowding eat other. Great experience and looking at their brunch menu online it seems they have great options there too."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of vegetarian/vegan options here in Calgary, but don't look any further, The Coup is your saving grace. I am not biased to this place because I am vegetarian, since I used to eat meat for 24 years. They have various selections, all from organic and local sources. I have not had a disappointing meal from this place, it's definitely a nice place to dine. Please give it a try."}
{"text":"Great to have a menu full vegetarian and vegan items but I found it rather greasy and salty for a restaurant I was hoping would be a healthier option."}
{"text":"I was wandering around the city killing time and figured some light bites and a cocktail would be great. So I wandered a few blocks further and stumbled right into The Coup. 

The doors were open and there were a few guests seated inside, but it wasn't all that busy. I chalked that up to the fact is was nearly 3pm on a weekday and checked out the cocktail menu outside before walking in to see what's up. 

Apparently, I'd missed the hours outside because they were just about to close between lunch and dinner. Regardless, I explained I was only after a drink and the bartender was happy to oblige. 

Sadly the cocktail I had eyed outside was taken off the menu, and seeing as many of the drinks have housemade ingredients, it's not that easy to just whip one up. So I went with option B, a scotch cocktail with chambord. I was nervous about it because chambord is so sweet, but the bartender insisted it was balanced.

The drink was rich and slightly syrupy, but in a good way. You didn't want to chug it, but it did go down easy. The chambord was pretty prominent, but the savory smokey notes of the scotch peeked through, breaking it up. 

The entire experience at The Coup was incredibly warm, friendly, and comfortable. I ended up sitting next to a local reporter who was interviewing the owner, so I got a bit of the backstory. 

When I'm back in Calgary I'll certainly swing in DURING OPEN HOURS to try some of the food!"}
{"text":"I'm glad the the Coup exists, and that it's been able to survive for almost 7 years now, especially in an area that has seen the rise and fall of many other restaurants.

But to me, the Coup is just okay. And \"just okay\" isn't a bad thing. It just means I don't think it's the greatest. There are many places now in Calgary that, while aren't a completely vegetarian restaurant, are happy to accomodate a vegan lifestyle. If you don't believe me, you can check out my list that has almost 125 restaurants on it. 

What it's great for is accommodating not just a vegan lifestyle, but dietary restrictions (I have several friends that can't have dairy, and others that have gluten allergies) and sensitivities. The staff is well-versed on what is and what isn't in the entrees, so you can order something and not be worried that you're going to get surprise whipped egg sauce.

I had their Upstream burger served in a brown rice tortilla, since I can't have their focaccia. It was nice, but rich and heavy. Even served inside a thin tortilla, so I can't imagine how much more lead-balloon-y I would've felt if the burger had been served with the standard bread. A tomato slice or even some ketchup would've done wonders for it. Also, when I bit in to one side, all I got was a huge mouthful of vegan aioli. 

It was served with their soup of the day, which I liked better. It was a cozy, hearty bowl of lentil soup where the lentils were still intact and gave the broth a warm, nutty flavor. 

My friend had their peanut satay noodle bowl, but could barely get through it because it was overloaded with way too much sauce and way too many peanuts. Restraint, chef! You could've served the noodle bowl with a plate of crackers for dipping in to the sauce, that's how much there was.

So, hit and miss. If I could rate them 3.5 stars I would, because I did appreciate the friendly and prompt service. And I do like that Meet is across the room, and you can order drinks and appetizers while you wait for a table. But at the end of the day, I'm there for the food, and the food is just okay for me."}
{"text":"The dishes are hit and miss I find. I would recommend NOT getting the satay with peanut sauce, it's too sweet and actually tastes like pure peanut butter without any complex flavors. However, you can definitely find some healthy choices here as well as gluten free options.  Drinks are quite expensive but there are some interesting choices they offer."}
{"text":"5 stars for a vegetarian restaurant in cattle country is terribly hard to achieve, but The Coup really deserves it. They serve wholesome, vegan/vegetarian options that are filling and well priced. The space is tiny, but it's worth it. Bonus points for buying as much local produce as possible. 

Now they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, and some of the desserts are vegan :)"}
{"text":"Falafel Quesadillas

Vibrant atmosphere.
Good service.
Top notch vegetarian restaurant."}
{"text":"My brother and I are having a vegan week and made sure to hit up The Coup.  It's early in our week, but I already know that going here will be a highlight.  

I had the Enchanted Stack (portabello mushroom, wheat berries, roasted red pepper puree, sauteed greens and shallots, curried walnut pate & sprouts on a bed of greens).

My meal was hearty and delicious but, on top of this, the staff were really great.  They were earnestly friendly, answered our questions well, and gave us just the right amount of attention.

The big downside of The Coup is that it can be really hard to get in.  A table for two at 6 PM on a week night can mean a 45 minute wait.  Today we showed up a few minutes before 5 PM and there was already a patio full of people waiting for the restaurant to open.  We easily got a table but the place was nearly full fifteen minutes later.

I like this restaurant but usually don't consider it because I know I won't get in."}
{"text":"This place is my JAM. I love this place. Ever since I first came here a few years ago it has
blown me away with its food and service. I'm a vegan/vegetarian and its very hard to find a 
good vegetarian restaurant. I am very cautious about what I put in my body and I love that theres a restaurant that is non-GMO organic :) I've tried a lot of things from the menu, and pretty much am never disappointed. Although the desserts can be a bit IFFY if you have a certain type of taste palette like myself. I tried the cheesecake and wasn't too impressed (which was a first) it had a strange aftertaste and could hardly finish it, even though I wanted to because everything is so pricey for me (student -__-')  
but if I ever feel like treating myself or if its a special occasion this is always my favourite."}
{"text":"Interesting building in a great location. The large front windows/patio lets in ample light and let's you people watch if you're into that kind thing.
Being a confirmed carnivore, I was wary about trying a vegetarian restaurant, but I could tell that a lot of care had gone into the menu and preparation. Everything tasted really fresh and had some interesting flavors.

The only thing I didn't like was how close the tables were in the middle of the room. The table next to us was literally a couple inches from ours! I think they try to make this less obvious by blaring electro lounge music. I had to raise my voice and there was miscommunication throughout the meal. Other than that, great experience.

Oh, and if you get a chance, check out the chefs mustache. It's a thing of marvel and beauty."}
{"text":"Overall, I find this restaurant a mixed-bag and I rarely think of going here for lunch.

The service is spotty to mediocre... and sometimes rude.

The menu is uninspired and decidedly old-school vegetarian.  Nothing new here.

Meh."}
{"text":"Great for lunch/brunch!  Great service and coffee"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best vegan food anywhere. Consistently good- try anything on the menu, it will be amazing. Excellent selection of dishes. Great prices. Friendly service. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great flavor and creative for the first vegetarian restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"Came here twice, both times was happy with the food. The drinks could use a little more tweaking. I ordered a bowl of deliciousness the second time and loved it. There was this coconut flavor in it and was just so soothing and good to eat. I haven't been back in a while, had to explore other restaurants. I'll be back next year though!"}
{"text":"Great vegan food. Only been here for brunches but I have had great experiences every time.

I had the coup Monsieur which was fantastic. The only thing was that the maple smoked tofu was way too salty. Good thing I ordered hash browns to balance it out.

The ice cream with chocolate and corn pops was amazing. Double high fives for that one!!! :)"}
{"text":"Anyways, when I walked in, I already loved the vibe, It's very chill with a beautiful bar, loud but not overly loud music, long tables with bench seating, and friendly faces. The menu was a little hard to navigate because I didn't quite know what some of the items were... no description available. But let me just say this. GET THE BABY BACK RIBS. JUST DO IT. It's so crazy good! And the wings.. LOVE! We also got the watermelon and feta salad, which I'm not really a fan of just because I don't like the strong smell of feta. And the macaroni and cheese was pretty good but got too heavy after the first few bites. The drinks here are strong. I got one whisky drink and you don't have to wonder where the alcohol went in this place. It's in my cup!! I could totally feel it after a few sips. Or maybe that's just how they do it in Calgary. Anyways, fantastic meal for 3 for under $100 with drinks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the coup! I'm a vegan & I'm thoroughly impressed with all of their vegan options! The service is amazing and the workers are very knowledgable!"}
{"text":"This place is so great. The atmosphere is very welcoming and cozy. service is awesome food and drinks are amazing!! I tried the falafel quesadilla -it was so nutritious and delicious (:  everything is made with good ingredients. I'll definitely be back to try everything else"}
{"text":"I love the Coup. It's a vegetarian/vegan paradise, and in my experience there's plenty to like even if you aren't strictly veggie. Maybe a little on the spendy side, but worth it. Just be warned, they do get busy!"}
{"text":"I was tempted to give a bad review to this place just so I wouldn't have to wait so long to get in but I just can't. This place is awesome. I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian but I do avoid meat. The Coup offers a lot of good choices on their menu. My bestie and I go there whenever we really want to treat ourselves, since it is a bit on the pricey side. Those cocktails doe! Soooo good! My favorite is the iggy pop, and it does sneak up on ya, there is quite a bit of booze but you would never guess it! I wish the coup had the no wait app but other than that I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Only in Calgary would a trendy and successful vegetarian restaurant be considered a 'coup'. 

Let's face it, this is one of the least animal-friendly cities in the developed world where their biggest claim to fame is a yearly 'Stampede' that results in the inhumane treatment and death of several horses and cows. It was surprise to find this restaurant here and packed with people too!

We arrived early, before they opened for dinner and there was already a small line up of people waiting to get in.

We left and came back 15mins later to find only one table available and snatched it moments before 2 other groups walked in. Defeated, they moved to the lounge known as 'The Meet'. 

I had the Cajun Tempeh sticks to start with a dijon-maple sauce. I generally dislike most forms of tempeh I encounter but these were exceptional. 

For an entree I took a leap of faith and went for the Dragon bowl(veggies, tofu, on basmati brown or quinoa) with a peanut satay sauce. I say leap of faith because some of the most bland tasting excuses for vegetarian food are sold under the same packaging at a popular Toronto veg chain *cough *cough *Fresh and make me wonder why I even bother trying to eat well. This is not true of The Coup Dragon bowl. It was flavourful and tasty.

Now listen up because this is the important part. You must, absolutely, undoubtly (put your religious beliefs on hold if need be or tuck your AA membership card back in your wallet) order a drink! How often does a vegetarian restaurant actually have a liquor license? The answer is not to damn often and this place is half lounge so they must know what they are up to in the mixology department.

I opted for the hot toddy in the form of a coconut rum soy chai latte. Sure it was July, but this is practically the Rockies and there's no hot sticky summer nights in Calgary. Oh baby baby, that hottie hit the spot!"}
{"text":"The first time I went, I was not a fan. It was a long wait, and the food tasted strange to me. 

The next time I went, however, I found I very much enjoyed the strangeness of the food. It's a nice step out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Very popular and very noisy. It used to be a tiny, friendly, place where the wait staff would take the time to chat. Yes, there was often a line but that is almost de rigeur at most of Calgary's best eateries. The food is good. The price is fair for 17th Ave..., did I say it was popular? So what's my beef?

There are many ingredients that go into making a good restaurant. Good food is high on that ingredient list but it is not only one. I want to feel comfortable at my table, be able to hear the Server when he/she speaks. I want to carry on a conversation with the people at my table and be heard without shouting. I want the Server to return to see if I need anything for more than the obligatory check in to see \"How are the first bites are tasting\". 

If this doesn't matter to you, or if you prefer a boisterous crowd, and don't mind feeling forgotten by the wait staff then I highly recommend The Coup. It is popular."}
{"text":"THE COUP. I like you, from the bottom of somewhere where my heart is supposed to be. I've never been to a place, whose decor, vibe, and attitude can be generally described as blanket freshly pulled from the dryer.

Wow, what a way to begin an review...this is why they invented bullies :S

But no joking, there's a plethora why people always flock back to THE COUP. I really love their lounge and the intimate seating they have. Once in a while they have a DJ playing a soft mix and makes conversation (or in the case you hang out with a dubious friend...ARGUMENTS and PETTY BICKERING) pleasant. Oddly enough their dining room is more bustling. They generously fit as much tables as they can there to make sure everyone gets a chance to sit down without elbowing their neighbors. Their servers must be part time dancers because there's no way a big galoot like me can more around those small aisles with food in my hand. Also they're the most charming conversationalist.

My last two visits here the food was amazing. I had their popular yam burger with salad which was so GUD I constantly told people around me to \"Shut their whistle makers\" while I enjoyed my amaze-which. Recently I tried their daily special which was a gnochi concoction that didn't fail to live up to it's momentary hype. You know a special is \"SPECIAL\" when you see them bringing it out constantly to tables around you. What did it taste like you ask? It tasted like \"you should should up and go find out for yourself\" is what it tasted like! Finally I think I found my comfort dish here in the form of their quinoa (pronounced QQQUEEEEEEEENWAAAA) basked in their green coconut curry sauce. Every spoonful I bit into made made me chuckle like a fat baby on a high chair.

I'm somewhat reserved on their cocktails. A little expensive for my taste even though it isn't much different compared to other cocktail joints along 17th. They do have funny names but I think I'll stick to my beer :)"}
{"text":"Really loved this place. On a cute street and very cozy inside. Both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks were fantastic and both my husband and I were happy.
The food was healthy but very well done, great flavors and combinations in the dishes. I wish I could have tried everything on the menu."}
{"text":"When it comes to vegetarian food, are there any other meat eaters out there feel intimidated? It's like I  expect to feel so far out of my element that I'm nervous to give it a chance. Well, as fellow meat eater to meat eater, please let me say \"Stop it. Stop it right now. There's nothing to be afraid of!\"

I caught myself feeling surprised at how inclusive The Coup felt. I then realized I had caught myself in the middle of a ridiculous prejudice I didn't even know I had. Of course The Coup is inclusive! It's filled with people who are passionate at what they do. In many cases this means getting wildly creative, digging in deep to find ways to meet meat-free dietary requirements that still exceed in flavour. You've got to think outside the box when you can't make something better just by putting bacon on it. Take me to your world!

The very first thing to open my mind were the cocktails. No, not in the kind of way that cocktails make everyone more open minded, but with and adult spin on delicious beverages I've only ever seen marketed for health benefits. An activated charcoal lemonade with tequila, for instance. Am I detoxing, or toxing? Do they cancel each other out, or do they compliment each other, utilizing charcoals positive effects on the body, and tequila's positive effect on my soul? Am I reading way too deep into this? Yes! Who cares?! It's delicious!

Boozy Kombucha party punch bowls... didn't get to try it, but that's reason enough for me to return!"}
{"text":"Service: Excellent
Drinks: Nice though small selection of beers/wine/teas/smoothies/etc.
Food: Excellent - the tempeh wrap had a delicious spicy kick to it - the sauce was dripping over everything.Wonderful thai soup and I'm not a soup person.
Appy platter of various dips, salads and crackers and vegetarian pate was a huge portion but a bit bland. The peanut satay bowl was a bit too saucy (overpowering), but flavourful. I didn't like being asked to move to another table to accommodate a bigger party. What? It was really awkward...
Only thing I didn't like about it is that since it's a tiny restaurant and so popular, it takes a while to get a seat. Not sure if they take reservations. If so, I'm coming here more often"}
{"text":"Crystal and I headed over to The Coup for dinner and the wait was looooooooong. That was all right with me for a bit because I figured it meant there would be good food. So we grabbed a spot in the bar area, ordering some cocktails and appetizers, and prepared to wait. I was not prepared to wait as long as we ended up having to however so in the end we just got our food to go.

While the fare was indeed fresh and flavorful I'm not really sure it was worth that wait. I would suggest ordering to go from the get go. Or perhaps filling up on small plates in the bar area. Or just going way before you're as starving as I was even.

I did, however, really enjoy the décor at The Coup. And you couldn't have asked for nicer service so I would try it again and hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Delicious but super hipster and small. I know it is currently closed for renovations so hopefully they are making it bigger to accommodate the large amounts of people that want to eat here. I honestly don't know why Calgary doesn't have more restaurants like this. There are only so many steakhouses a city can sustain without rebellion taking place.

Anyway, the food here is super good, and should not be avoided because you are a meateater. They do have a lot of tofu as a meat substitute which can be annoying for those looking to avoid soy. My favourite is always the tempeh shawarma--I get it pretty religiously. Their juices are delish, I'm a fan of their carrot apple ginger. When I want to switch it up I get their satay bowl, mostly because I could bathe in their satay sauce. They also have a great brunch menu that is good for something different on the brunch scene (french toast stuffed with smoked tempeh and cheese, I doubt you can find this anywhere else!). 

I also bought their cookbook (can be purchased online and mailed very quick), not really any pictures and some hard to find ingredients but a lot of the stuff is pretty doable (come at me satay sauce)."}
{"text":"I have A LOT of good stuff to say about this place! Considering I am not a vegetarian, I probably would never have checked this place out if it was not for my two vegetarian pals that came down over the weekend!! If you are not a vegetarian do not stress. Even if you do not like the food, the drink menu will blow you away. (NO joke, its super long and all of the drinks are unique and interesting.)

First off when you walk in, it is very cosy and cute inside! I really liked the atmosphere of this place. The servers were all dressed super cute and they were really nice! We got seated immediately (it was around 7ish on a Saturday night). All three of us decided to try a fancy drink! We ordered the \"Bubbles and fresh squeeze\", \"iggy pop\" and the \"red sangria\". They all came in different fancy glasses and came topped with very unique garnishes. They are a little pricey but nothing I have not payed before. Check out the list here: http://www.thecoup.ca/menu/cocktails/ (this does not even include their fancy hot drinks, wine and beers).

Since I had eaten earlier I shared the Rosemary Yam Fries with garlic aoili (which was to die for) and the Tandoori Cauliflower Wings with one of my friends. I had never had Tandoori anything before and it blew my mind. My other pal had the Tempeh Shwarma, which was also very delicious even considering I had no idea what Tempeh was in the first place! 

Overall the experience here was REALLY great. I would definitely go back even without my vegetarian friends. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars in because of how large the drink menu was (took us about 30 minutes to figure out what we wanted) and the overall price. Nice place for a date night or for a little splurge! Looks like a great place to work too!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants! They make a delicious vegan quiche for breakfast, and their daily cocktails are very flavourful. The service and ambiance are great and the food never fails to impress."}
{"text":"An over priced place to eat, but none the less, delicious. The upstream burger is delicious and very filling  and their apple cider vinegar shots taste delicious!"}
{"text":"The third salt/pepper shaker on the table is cayenne. Not cinnamon. I don't recommend putting your finger in your eye directly after screwing the top back on to the cayenne. I actually don't recommend putting cinnamon in your eye either.  

I had the Clock Work Orange to drink - like an orange Gin and tonic. It was delicious.

I ordered the Greek Goddess or something like that for dinner, and it was delicious!

Both times I've been here, it's been QUITE a wait for tables, but if you're not in a hurry, then go for it. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"Let's just say that my even carnivorous family will request that when we are all congregate in Calgary, we dine at The Coup. It's THAT good. Service has always been friendly and the food has never disappointed. Nothing quite like consistently high quality ;) They support local artists, always adorning the walls with artworks. 
The Coup also sells a cookbook with a selection of their recipes for 25$. 

In terms of what to order, you can't really go wrong with anything. My personal fave is and always has been the falafel quesadilla, accompanied by a teeny bowl of garlicky tzadziki and a side of salad with shredded carrots and beets. Every soup has been a masterful blend of spices and ingredients, last visit the special being a polenta broccoli creation. Their salads have multi-layered flavours going on, with a mix of nuts, veggies, sometimes even goat's cheese, and always yummy dressings.

Always expect at least a bit of a wait to be seated. Another note is that despite my love for the atmosphere of the place, the amazing food quality, and the kindness of the service, I find that the music is always a tad loud for my liking. Or maybe I'm just a granny haha! But in all seriousness, for a filling and flavourful (vegetarian) meal, The Coup on 17th Ave should be your automatic destination."}
{"text":"Since this is my daughters last day in Calgary, we wanted to grab a healthy, fresh tasting lunch from one of the great and eclectic dining spots in Calgary.   Of course as a foodie that considers herself a yelpster (yep me) I had my daughter get on Yelp and search for a spot around 17th street since I had something to do over here after...
The COUP fit the bill and wow am I beyond thrilled she found this place!
I am not a vegetarian, but am trying to ween myself from eating meat in an effort to make this a lifestyle choice.
Food 5/5
Service 5/5
Price 5/5- caveat is that it's a bit costly but 
I expect to pay more for fresh organic food....
My salad was pure fresh goodness with a maple balsamic dressing that was light and tasty and seeds in the salad that added a great crunch (and protein)
She had the Bun Me - a Vietnamese inspired sandwhich that looked amazing and tasted even better.
The only thing I can say is sign me up for more, I plan to make this place a regular on my dining out list!!"}
{"text":"The Coup is on a steep decline. What was once a restaurant with decent, flavourful food is becoming a pale imitator of its past self, and hopefully they can turn themselves around before it's too late. Let's start with ambience. Poor lighting, very loud, uncomfortable seating, stuffy atmosphere. The past few times I've been, I've actually had to step outside to breathe. Also, why is the water they bring to the table always warm? 

Anyways, here's a review of several items on the menu.

$6 Vinegar shots: Why?

Rosemary yam fries (+ tahini miso gravy): They love yam. Not my preference because of the sweetness, but they're decent enough as far as yam fries go. What is up with the tahini miso gravy? It is extremely bitter. I can fully guarantee that they used the \"health food\" tahini instead of real Middle Eastern tahini, because the notes of sesame taste so unpleasant and off. It does not taste like the (far superior) miso gravy at Vancouver's Naam, so if you're expecting anything remotely similar, or even just comparably enjoyable, you'll be disappointed.

Organic rainbow greens: Last time I ordered this, the greens were going bad. A vegetarian restaurant should not have bad salads. 

Tempeh shawarma: The only good item on the menu. It's a bit harder to eat now that they've switched from using a tortilla to the laffa bread, but it's a balanced, vibrantly flavoured, filling dish. 

Upstream burger: More yam abuse. This veggie burger does not stay together! So messy, cloyingly sweet, and they do not skimp on the mayo. If you encountered an alien who didn't speak English and you had 30 seconds to try to define a veggie burger to them, this is what they'd come up with. It's not enjoyable to eat. 

Flowers, Blossoms, and Petals (this is what they've decided to call a vegan cheesecake): Cheesecake as made by someone who's never tried cheesecake. Well-plated, but grainy, dry, and bland. This is what happens when you orient all of your recipes around their instagram potential: it looks great, but it's a chore to eat. 

Chia-Cactus Soother: Cloyingly sweet. Cut the sugar in half, and then we can talk.

Orange juice: is $6.75.

Tea: is $4.75.

Latte: is $6.50.

DRIP COFFEE: is $3.50.

Don't bother with any of the attempts at food from Asian cuisines, because it's all bland, lifeless, and unsatisfying. Go to a veg-friendly Chinese, Japanese, Thai, or Vietnamese restaurant instead.

If you're looking for quality vegetarian or vegan food, you'd be better off going to Tamarind, Veg-In YYC, Heart's Choices, Ten Foot Henry (though not entirely vegetarian), or one of Calgary's many international restaurants. As a vegetarian of 11 years, please, stop making us look bad."}
{"text":"Was walking by, looking for a late lunch, when I spotted this place.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I enjoy good vegetarian food, so I asked for a recommendation from the menu.  The server suggested I get the falafel quesadillas with the soup of the day (a broccoli something...)  

The broccoli soup was good, but maybe needed something to give it a little punch of flavor.  It seemed a bit watery and plain.  The quesadillas were delicious and filling - I'd definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today with high hopes. After simply forgetting to make my drink (and then not offering to comp it?), we received our improperly prepared food (if you're going to bother asking how I want my eggs poached, then you should deliver on what I ask for). The flavors were decent but the food very overpriced, even for their \"ethically\" gathered grub. I'm not sure why everyone is so gaga over this place. 

In general, the service was slow and not particularly hospitable. My food was under-seasoned, and I didn't want to eat the second half of it (I would have returned it if I wasn't hungry and in a rush). My boyfriends food was good- not great but good."}
{"text":"Went to The Coup for my birthday dinner yesterday. I have never been to this area of the city, and was pleasantly surprised by all the neat stores, restaurants and parks! 

I walked into the restaurant and was struck by the wood accents and modern look and feel of the space, but also how it incorporated some trendy features with the plants in the wall, and the servers that were working. 

I ordered the 'Cherry Bomb' (homage to the Runaways?) cocktail. I am not a big cocktail fan, but wanted something different to drink, and it was my birthday...so I do what I want :P It was a nice balance of sweet from the cherry, with the sharp liquor flavours of apple brandy and buffalo trace (the apply brandy and some of the other liquors are from Ironworks, a local Nova Scotian distillery! Woot!). 

I ordered the ban-mi bun with their soup of the day, potato beer. Waiting for the food to arrive I sipped my drink and people watched. The bartender made some chit chat with me as I waited, which was great to have that conversing opportunity. The waitresses, bartenders and hostesses were always trying to be friendly and chatty, which is a nice change from some places. 

Food arrived and I was hesitant with the ban mi since the menu stated it would be on a ciabatti bun, which is not traditional. However I was pleasantly surprised when I bit into a nice crispy, buttered bun that was perfect! Albeit not traditional, it was tasty and all the flavours and textures came together nicely. I had the garlic hot sauce put on the side as I was worried it would be too spicy for me with the already spicy kimchi, as I am a bit of a wimp with spicy food. I really am not my fathers daughter, both he and my brothers would gladly pour it on and ask for seconds! Having it on the side definitely let me control the spice, which ended up not being that bad anyways, just enough heat and flavour to add to the rest of the sandwich. The soup was eaten afterwards to let it cool, it was equally delicious! With micro bits of potato in it, there was enough texture to make it less of a liquid soup, although not much beer flavour. I suppose I could have poured my cocktail in there if I was really desperate for an alcohol flavour in my soup XD 

After finishing I ordered dessert! I was really looking forward to this part as I looked up the menu before hand and this dessert popped out at me. It is a lemon coconut \"square\" (actually circular). It had a small crust and plenty of filling! I love lemon flavoured food (among others like coconut, vanilla, chocolate, mint, peanut butter...I digress). This \"square\" had the perfect combination of lemon tangy-ness and I was a happy camper :D 

Overall, the food was fantastic! Although I am not a devote vegetarian or do I have any serious food restrictions, they had enough options to help pretty much any person. The servers were very friendly, and the atmosphere of the place was casual and earthy/trendy."}
{"text":"Awesome time! The service is top notch, the food really hit the mark (and I'm no vegetarian), the ambiance is unique! We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The Coup is a City Gem and a Vegetarians dream Cafe/restaurant. 

For starters they change the menu frequently- so if you have a favourite 1 night... your lucky if they make it again. I find placing request and comments makes it a reoccurring meal.  The waitress' are always fashionable in artsy boho style, and most importantly they smile and are very friendly.  Every time I have been there the place is sardines with (odd paring of people) hungry yuppies,  vegans and  groups of families who assume they might have at least 1 dish with meat and look utterly disappointed when Hummus and Tofu are served in their meal. Funny thing is once they try the food- they instantly look pleased.

The style of the restaurant is welcoming, artsy, simple and yet presents some edge with the funky lights and Indie music. The dishes are delicious, and I recommend anyone and everyone to try The Coup."}
{"text":"I visited The Coup with some vegan friends while in Calgary for a conference.  There aren't many vegan options in Calgary, so it's great to have an upscale, ethically sourced restaurant like this.  However, in my opinion The Coup is a bit over-hyped.

They have a nice range of really interesting and creative cocktails, and the food was good.  But it's really pricey for what you get.  The portions (especially for the appetizers) are small: the eggplant sleeping bags were three minuscule little eggplant wraps, and the cauliflower buffalo wings (which we were told were a \"large\" portion) consisted of six or seven pieces of cauliflower.  Delicious cauliflower, yes, but know what you're getting into, portion-wise.

The main dishes were all good, and entree portions are significantly bigger.  There's a wide variety of dishes, and both vegans/vegetarians and meat-eaters should find something to like here.  A friend and I shared the hot pot, which was tasty enough, but need the addition of a bit of ginger hot sauce.  I tried bites of the dragon bowl and tempeh shawarma that my friends ordered -- again, good, but not as flavorful as you might hope.

Ultimately, none of the flavors were really stellar, and when a bahn mi sandwich costs $17 and a bowl of veggies and noodles almost as much, you expect the seasonings and textures to knock you out.  

I've had much more interesting vegan food in Los Angeles, where I used to live -- and while I do understand that it might not be fair to compare offerings in vegan-centric southern California to cow-crazy Alberta, I wouldn't rush back to The Coup.

PS: Reservations are only taken for larger groups."}
{"text":"Every so often you would meet someone who is a vegan, gluton-free--just bring them over here! I tried their treehouse sanwich, it was delicous and very filling. My friend had a salad which looked AMAZING! They are a variety of drinks the seem interesting too.coconut with tea, mix some tea with coconut! I love they way that their menu is and the names they have given to their entrees. It's a good place to go when you want a nice meal, but want it to be healty, or when you are on a cleanse!"}
{"text":"The coup serves large portions of thoughtful and innovative vegetarian food, some of which I could easily whip up at home, and others of which would take me way too much time to do so. Service was both accommodating and friendly. I loved how they have a special piece of the menu with side dishes (or add-ons, more specifically), enabling us to easily craft a lunch for our daughter. If only they had a changing table or were located in Edmonton."}
{"text":"Great veggie restaurant! I've been going for years. Awesome vegan root beer floats. LOve the tree house sandwhich"}
{"text":"So my buddy who's a vegan asks me to go to the coup with him and immediately I'm terrified I might die or get kidnapped. Maybe there's a machine that doesn't let you leave until you're vegan. 

This did not happen. I liked meat and I still like meat. But the coup was AWESOME. It was delicious, and the vibe of the whole place was awesome. 

Will for sure come back :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, ambience, and quality of food. Their cheesecake is to die for So happy we found this place on our trip to the stampede!"}
{"text":"Pretty good but a long wait, mediocre service and high prices gimp an eclectic and interesting menu. I found only some of the items good and really felt a lack of depth in some of the dishes I tried. My favourites were the tempeh shawarma. I'm eager to go back and try more though. 
Dessert menu was very nice and varied, I had a delicious affogato."}
{"text":"Finally, a place where I can order tasty food from the menu without asking about what's in the salad dressing or whether they put surprise bacon on things, or can I have this but without the that... Plus they have a great menu, and good beer. No taps, that's my only suggestion for improvement. Great vibe, comfy, friendly staff. 

It's not super cheap but it's prepared by people who take food seriously. Good tasting food with great presentation is worth more than a crappy sandwich or burger prepared by wage slaves imported from a Third World country by an owner who doesn't want to pay his staff the going rate."}
{"text":"My husband and I have changed our diet and decided to go vegan. It's amazing btw! Watch this documentary on Netflix called \"Forks over Knives\". Any who, we have eaten at The Coup probably 5 times in the last 4 months and every....single....meal is AMAZING! Unbelievably flavorful, filling, great choices, service is excellent! Even if you aren't vegan (like my dad!) still try this place. If my crazy meat eating father liked it, you will too! Decently priced too!! 

My faves so far...burger, quiche, soup of the day, sweet potatoes fries with garlic aioli, and the vegan charcuterie board. Also, we do a shot of the flavor infused apple cider vinegar. So good, go!"}
{"text":"the coup was amazing! the menu selection were so wide and the food itself was impeccable, the atmosphere is so warming and cozy. would definitely recommend to anyone who lives in calgary or is just visiting!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while now. The Atmosphere is great (has a real hipster vibe) and service was good. Unfortunately, I wasn't overwhelmed by the food. My girlfriend and I had the sushi and eggplant sleeping bags to start. The sushi was just ok and I found the pesto in the eggplant dish to be a little on the salty side. We shared the beach-front hot pot as our main which was just ok as well, I found the flavors to be a little unbalanced and felt like I could make a better vegetable curry at home (why go out then?!?).
All in all an ok meal, I'm glad I tried this restaurant but do not think I will go back. It's too bad because this restaurant really has the potential to be amazing. They have a great ambiance and a really cool cocktail menu, their menu just needs a little help."}
{"text":"Vegetarian cuisine has always had a special spot in my heart, even though the idea of becoming a full-fledged vegetarian never even crossed my mind. Many non-vegetarians still have old stigma towards it, thinking that all vegetarians ever eat is salad (and may be tofu for the more adventurous type). But I've had my fair share of vegetarian recipes to know that the way the vegetarians have sought out to eliminate meat from their diet goes far beyond living off of what traditionalists might call \"rabbit food\". In fact, one can logically argue that the vegetarian cuisine is far more interesting than its meat-included counterpart; for one, meat-included recipes don't have the same, intricate details in vegetarian-friendly recipes that somehow need to make up for the lack of protein and even flavours in the more conventional list of vegetables. 

Unfortunately for vegetarians/vegans and the vegetarian-fanatics (such as myself), Calgary has very little to offer when it comes to restaurants that specialize in vegetarian cuisine. Sure, it is much easier to find a mainstream restaurant these days that have an item or two on its menu specifically for vegans/vegetarians. However, these vegan/vegetarian-friendly items from mainstream restaurants are almost always so dull and flavourless that they fail to live up to what is offered from a strictly vegan/vegetarian restaurant. Much like ordering a barbecued rib from a rib house would be different from ordering a McRib from McDonalds, the lack of vegetarian/vegan-friendly restaurants in Calgary cannot be compensated for by having generic restaurants with a few, awfully boring dishes to offer to vegetarians/vegans. 

However, if you happen to be a vegetarian and work/live within walking distance from 17th Ave SW and 9 St. SW, you are in luck. The Coup, which sits between 9 St. SW and 8 St. SW on 17th Ave., just happens to be one of the few vegetarian restaurants in Calgary. Not a single item on its menu has meat in it, though please note that I said \"vegetarian\", not \"vegan\"; the restaurant does not shy away from using dairy products/eggs/etc. If you are a vegan, you will still find items on its menu that is fitting to the diet of a determined herbivore; however, if you are going to be offended by seeing people lick dripping egg yolks or goat cheese from their utensils, I would highly suggest you to stay away from this place as you would in any non-strictly-vegan restaurant. 

I went there to have lunch with my friend, so it was for a casual occasion. Most of the guests at the restaurant seemed like they had come from their work for a bite; there were a few tables that were vacant when I arrived, and it was still half an hour before noon. Unsurprisingly, the few vacant tables filled up quickly as my friend and I sat down and started going through the menu. Only a few stayed to wait, though I reckoned that had to do more with time constraint due to work than anything. One conclusion I made from this observation was that this restaurant would have a tough time accommodating any group larger than four during its busy (and less flexible) lunch hours. 

The server did an excellent job in making sure that my friend and I were comfortable and also that we were familiar enough with what was on a one-page-but-extensive menu to make an agreeable choice. My friend ordered the Green House Effect salad, while I ordered the falafel quesadillas, and they came to our table promptly enough at the same time. I got the salad as the side, and it was just as good as you can expect from a garden salad - nothing unique and memorable, but still good enough to wet your appetite. My friend had already started on her meal-sized salad, and seemed to be enjoying it. I should note here that the portion for both of what we ordered were quite huge, though not an inappropriately large size for lunch. 

As for what I ordered, it was the best falafels I've had as far as I can remember. Falafels are essentially chickpeas, herbs & spices and other vegetables that have been put through a blender and formed into bite-sized balls. The trouble with making falafels is to achieve the perfect balance between being too dry and being too greasy. Most falafels I've had always fell in either one side of those two extremes; however, the falafels I had at The Coup were just perfectly in the middle. I have no idea how the chefs at the restaurant managed to achieve that perfect balance, but they did and the end result was my mouth being full with delicious mix of flavours and perfect textures. 

My friend and I were both pleased with our experience at The Coup, and have already made plans to go back sometime soon to explore other items on its menu. I would be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to it; in fact, if this restaurant was more convenient for me to access, I'd be there for lunch at least once a week. 

Thank you for reading the review. 4 & 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Canadian Food = Bland Wholesome and Comforting

Vegetarian Food = Bland Wholesome and Comforting

Sounds like a marriage made in heaven to me.

Coup really delivers the goods on High Quality Good Time Vegetarian food.

Everything is all natural, bio-sustainable, locally produced, non-GMO, watered by organic water and fertilized only by poop from 100% organic folk singers.

The ingredients are pretty high quality.

The room is nice and the bowls are beautiful.

It does not hurt that they have an excellent excellent bar (heh heh).

This is an all natural place - so I had a Cucumber Collins.

There was gin in it, but there was also cucumber in it. This means it counts as a salad.

It tasted magnificent and was certifiably potent.

The Lemongrass soup tasted like pea soup, and had the consistency of pea soup.

No lemon, no grass, but that was probably  the result of being pureed.

There is nothing wrong with tasting like pea soup. I like pea soup, so I was happy.

Main dishes run to the bowl of noodles or plate of healthy grains with steamed veggies and the sauce of your choice.

Great big coarsely cut veggies. Good miso sauce.

I was filled to the gills with garbanzo beans and brown rice.

Mild happy happy food.

Dessert? Eh.

Dessert was not as spartan as  those macrobiotic desserts served by the high priests of no-sugar who believe that if you want dessert, your shakras are out of balance, and the only solution is to give you a dessert you would never want to order again.

Dessert was not as spectacular as the great vegan cooks of the twenty first century who know how to make healthy desserts  that are utterly decadent.

We labored through a vegan gluten free chocolate torte that was neither a punishment nor a treat.

But never mind dessert, get happy, get healthy and get balanced with grains vegetables and miso sauce.

And bartender, make me another six or seven of them cucumber things, while I wait for the floor to stop undulating........"}
{"text":"First visit in many years because they don't take reservations. It was a late brunch so we got a table right away facing windows (nice). When I saw that the chai latte was $6.25 should have bolted right then and there. Got the rooibos tea for $4.25. Again pricey. Very average traditional breakfast for $15. Two poached eggs cooked perfect, interesting king mushroom bacon (I liked, my friend did not appreciate), potatoes tasty enough but nothing special, and the worst dry and hard beans as a side. $25 each with tax and 20% tip. Too rich for average. Sorry I wasted my Sunday. Won't be back with too many other great spots for brunch. Servers were attentive and fine."}
{"text":"The Coup is a truly fantastic addition to the Calgary food scene, and how well it is loved is evidenced by a an often present line-up. The apparent prime function of adjacent \"Meet\" is to provide eager diners a place to comfortable wait, which is definitely a plus (especially when it's too cold to wait outside). I've visited many times and have always had pleasant, helpful, and unpretentious service.

Brunch is a fantastic way to enjoy The Coup, with a fresh and wonderful fritatta option every day. They also both vegetarian and vegan options for most items, using tofu scramble.

As much as I enjoy on their brunch menu, there are a couple of items on the lunch/dinner menu, though, that I crave and/or dream about. The first is the falafel quesadilla, which has a truly amazing combination of flavors, is filling, and is all around a wonderful dish. Try it with their house salad or soup (or both, as their simple salad itself is great, and their soups rarely disappoint).

The other dish I love is their peanut satay bowl, but with their \"spicy almond\" sauce instead. It is so, so good and nice and spicy. I generally ask for no tofu but extra broccoli, which soaks up the sauce and tastes scrumptious.

In all, if you like clean, fresh food, with great flavor, definitely hit up The Coup. Brace yourself for something different, and keep an open mind. It is a not to be missed restaurant in Calgary for vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and I enjoyed it enough to come back for dinner the same day.

Everything is vegetarian.  Most dishes can be made vegan and/or gluten free.  All desserts are vegan.

They don't have much competition in Calgary, so locally they are definitely 5-star \"as good as it gets\".  On a world-wide basis, they are a solid 4.5 stars.  Rounding up to 5 overall."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a friend since she requested for her birthday. I will admit I loved the drink selection, the food was tasty, and the service was good, however I do think that it is grossly overpriced for what you get. 

I know vegan food is hyped and this place is on 17th ave, which alone makes prices go up. But over $80 for two people for lunch is a bit much.

They definitely have their market, but I probably wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan restaurant! Even for non-vegans. The the veggie burger and cauliflower wings were delicious. The quesadilla was just okay. They have nice outdoor seating. I think it was a bit overpriced, and was annoying that they charged extra for ketchup and hot sauce and didn't let us know. Would come back and get the veggie burger every time"}
{"text":"what's not to love, a great local vegan spot with amazing options.  If you needed more validation, I took a vegan from Toronto here and he was blown away.   Even my veggie family from the US came here 3x in 3 days because it was just unreal.

Why it's worth so many visits:

1. Great portion sizes
2. inventive cocktails (some are on (partial) fire when they show up
3. creative vegan options for the regular meat eaters (see upstream \"burger\", with gluten free pita)
4. unreal desserts, get the Woodland
5. seasonal waffles (sweet and savory), hoping for a return this winter

Not veggie or vegan?  vegan after 6?  no matter, this is the spot

p.s their cookbook makes a great gift for your vegan friends"}
{"text":"This is a great vegetarian restaurant near downtown Calgary. I'm not vegetarian but I really enjoyed all of the fresh veggie full options! I tried the eggs benedict with roasted potatoes and homemade ketchup. It was very filling and a nice brunch spot to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. 
The server was nice but not warm. 
I got a seat at the bar, and ordered the Thai hot pot. 
Kind of expected something light and delicious, and on contrary, I got a really thick soup, and tasted really really bland. I put a lot of salt to try to add some taste to to soup, but it didn't help at all. 
Bad experience at this restaurant, overpriced."}
{"text":"Ok - this restaurant is clearly for card carrying, hempwearing, granola eating, treehugging hippies - and I mean this with all the love and respect I have being from Victoria :)  
Are you celiec ? Vegetarian perhaps ? How about lactose intolerant ?? This is the spot for you !!!! 
The food is delicious, for what it is - no doubt about it but the truth of the matter is I like meat.......especially pork and to enjoy a brunch without some kind of pork product isn't really brunch in my book but since I was dining with a dear friend who is in fact celiac and Lactose I was happy to indulge her, let me not forget to mention that she is also pregnant - I really do have a heart of gold !
They also have a selection of organic wines, it'll do for me in a pinch."}
{"text":"Awesome place, everybody's really cool and the food is out of this world!  Be prepared though as it gets really busy and you may need to wait a bit and there is no air conditioning."}
{"text":"What a nice place!  Had the ramen noodles - amazing taste and perfect serving size. Chocolate torte was heavy but delicious. Coconut chai latte heavenly!"}
{"text":"This review is for \"Meet\" only.

Good drinks, albeit a bit pricey. Couch arrangement is nice, but people seem to \"hog\" the space a bit which I thought was strange. I mean, if you see a group of friends sitting down with one left standing or bringing over a very high stool since there is nowhere to sit, isn't it common sense to move over, especially, when you and your gf are taking up the entire bench?

Anyway, I can't really blame that on the place.

Enjoyed the free snacks, too. Loved the decor. Quite similar to Una. 

Did not see the bathrooms here. Next time, I would definitely dine here over Una, however!"}
{"text":"This seriously is the best breakfast place we've ever been to. Incredible food, cocktails, ambience, service.... just a really top-notch spot that combines casual with classy. Laid back but simultaneously upscale and trendy.

This place is so good, I feel like they should allow an option to add a sixth star. Like, one extra star per year per Yelper. Seriously- this place is worthy of Yelp developers rolling out a software update just to add that rare extra star for the establishments that REALLY stand out in all regards!!

Until then, please just trust my unofficial rating system: The Coup=

Shout out to our amazing bartender/server/recommender Jessica!! As well as Mickey, who no longer works at The Coup but he was equally amazing and helped make enough of an impression on us we just HAD to come back!!

It's even better the second time...
Six stars people. SIX STARS!"}
{"text":"Really nice vegetarian restaurant with creative dishes and great ambience and decor. A bit crowded, so you will probably hear others' conversations, and maybe a bit louder than I prefer for an intimate conversation, but still pleasant. My dish was great (Bun Me), lots of flavor. The appetizer we ordered (Eggplant Sleeping Bags) was pleasant.  My husband's jamaican pizza (which is possibly not on the menu anymore?) was very spicy, he didn't realize the heat level and couldn't eat much of it (I enjoyed the leftovers the next day). My personal disappointment was the cocktail I ordered, I don't think it's on the menu anymore either, it sounded like an exciting flavorful beverage but tasted like a 7&7 with a fancy garnish.  Drinkable, and certainly not bad, but I felt it was not worth the price.  I had asked the server (who was great, by the way) for recommendations for a cocktail that is not sweet... this was not in the dessert category but was definitely on the sweet side, for me.  But overall the food was tasty, of excellent quality and freshness, and the restaurant has a nice vibe. I will likely be back, I will just be more careful in choosing my drink."}
{"text":"As a certified meet eating (craving) Calgarian who does not in fact like many vegetables, one would think I might never make in to a vegan restaurant. But there I was, Friday night, decked out in my leathers and chowing down on delicious vegan fare! And it was my idea! And I was the one who suggested it! I may have lasted as a vegetarian back in the day if places like this had been there to keep me on the vegetables path. 

When we sat down, I kind of pushed my jacket to the back, trying to camouflage my carnivorous proclivities from the socially conscious inhabitants and waitstaff. Fortunately, I wasn't outed and the service we received was excellent. 

First we sat in Meet, the lounge area. I lol'd at the double entendre, no lies here. After sucking back some vegan cocktails with the delicious and full of real fruit Party Bowl (I think that is what it was called), we moved onto the grub. We knocked back some simple deliciouses, proving once and for all that as long as food is tasty and I am not aware of the onions within, I will savour anything.

I would definitely recommend the Coup for a delicious dinner to vegans and non-vegans alike. It is an opportunity to try something new and tasty. Clearly Calgary is in on the secret, as the place was packed."}
{"text":"I've never heard of The Coup until my sista brought me here for brunch on a Saturday morning. We were in luck - no line (unheard of for Saturday brunch in Calgary) but we were seated promptly and able to order right away.

They have an outdoor patio with a few chairs for people to sit and people watch but it was still on the cool side, so no one was eating outside just yet. The interior is super slick - open air, modern and gives off a cool, hipster hippie vibe without trying too hard to impress. Me likey.

My sis has been here multiple times so I let her do the ordering. Let the experts do their thaaaang.

- 2x Bubbles & fresh squeeze ($10.50) - 5 oz carafe of fresh squeeze organic orange juice,  1/2 oz elderflower liquere, peach bitters, and 5 oz prosecco. Essentially, a mimosa to brighten up your morning! Fresh, bubbly, and refreshing. Although on the expensive side, to say the least.
- Falafel quesadilla ($15.50) with brown rice tortilla ($1.50) - falafel, hummus, tahini, sundried tomatoes, sheep feta, cabbage, carrots, pickles, black olives, and banana peppers grilled in a sprouted tortilla and served with tzatziki. My sis and I both shared our dishes. The tortilla had a satisfying crunch to it. Add a bit of both sauces to the quesadilla and you're good to go.  
- El sombrero ($15.00) with brown rice tortilla ($1.50) - 2 smoked tofu with seasonal greens, spiced black beans, sundried tomato, red onion, mushroom and avocado grilled on a sprouted tortilla, with sprouts, tomato jam and garlic aioli served with rosemary hashbrowns and choice of soup or salad. We went with the daily soup (they put it on the quesadilla plate), a roasted red pepper, which was light, creamy and healthy. I never use beans when I make my sandwiches, genius! The hashbrowns could have been crispier. It was lacking some flavour.
- Chocolate torte ($9.00) - made with a chickpea brownie crust and mousse top served with seasonal preserves. This was really, really good. I'm not the biggest chocolate dessert fan but the mousse with the sauce (tasted like a currant compote) was match made in heaven. We were going to pack half of it for later but ended up eating it all, oops.

The Coup is a cool spot to catch up with friends and/or to bring a date along. The service is friendly, the food is vegetarian (think local, organic, gluten and vegan friendly) and the cozy, relaxed atmosphere makes me actually want to recommend a vegan restaurant for once. Shocker, I know."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday. They have an extensive menu on drinks (alcoholic or not). I was waiting for a friend to arrive and the waitress was so attentive making sure I was okay. It is now spring so the patio is now open and there were plenty of people soaking up vitamin D. 

I had the sombrero with hash browns, and it was so good. Coming from LA and knowing what real Mexican food is and bumping into many misses of Mexican food has been disappointing. Although, this was not much like the authentic Mexican food, it was good because it wasn't trying too hard to be that. The coup did not try to mimic so much rather than really make it their own. My friend ordered messy jessy, he was very happy with it and I was happy he was happy considering he is a strong meat eater. 

Some may say this place is overpriced, but in my opinion it's a decent price. The place, the ambience, the food, and the customer service were all great. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic Menu - these guys have filled a very big void in Calgary with a great vegetarian restaurant. 
Loved the Beach Front Hot Pot... and the Almond Satay Bowl was a big hit with my lunch partner....
Great food, great drink menu, great ambiance. Love it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quirky vegetarian restaurant then this is the place for you - especially since Gratitude Cafe closed :'( 

I wasn't overly impressed with the dishes I tried (falafel quesadilla, almond satay bowl, eggplant appetizers) so I thought it was a bit overpriced. The food was good nonetheless and quite creative."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed with my dinner. I wish I had room to try the desserts because they sounded so amazing as well.  I had the soup of the day which was a cauliflower turmeric tandoori, a sushi roll appetizer (which was good but probably my least favorite of the dishes), some large assorted appetizer plate and a main dish of the hot pot bowl, which with the soup was the highlight of my meal.  

I have eaten at a massive number of vegetarian / vegan friendly restaurants worldwide and this was some of the best food that I have had.  My drinks were also good as well, I had a maple matcha tea and a Vietnamese iced coffee.    The drinks were on the small size for the price, but the meal was enormous, so large that I had trouble finishing it and no room left for dessert.  Waitress was super attentive as well.

Came with a large party, most of who are not vegetarians and the food was a hit for almost everyone in the crowd."}
{"text":"This is a great retro decorated restaurant and \"bar\", which we soon found out we could sit in while waiting for a table.  I believe the bar side of this joint is called Meet, but we were so super hungry so we just decided to eat in there.

I was so impressed by the 70s retro furniture, lamps, tables, nice presentation of food, that I forgot to notice that I was actually tasting anything. I didn't pick up on this till later, food portions are small for what you are ordering, I had some sort of eggplant dish that was wrapped but it looked a little too much like tongue for me.

The scene there is really hip, too much to see in too little time.  Well after reading other yelper reviews the huge question mark in my head about this whole place has been solved.  It is a vegan restaurant, nowhere did I pick up on this and I am sure if I was vegan I would have spotted this a mile away.

Would I return?  Yes, keeping this in mind I think I would totally give a different review."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Calgary I was quite scared that I would not be able to find any Vegan/Vegetarian restaurants. During my hunt I found \"The Coup\". Although their no reservations policy can seem to be slightly annoying at first, I've come to realise it's now my favourite system; It gives you a chance to 'try out' a restaurant without any real commitment, if you walk in take a look around and aren't really feeling it, you can leave without feeling like you're forced to take a table and stay.

The Coup has been one of the better food experiences I've had in Calgary and have returned multiple times.

I had the flatbread the first time I was there, it was absolutely delicious! All in all I don't feel like it's really expensive whatsoever, but then again I do have a very different view of expensive than most people :P

I would and have been recommending The Coup to everyone I know, it's an awesome place to go, and a great introduction to vegetarian food if you haven't made the leap to try it before."}
{"text":"The local Vegetarian restaurant in 17th ave.
Went them for brunch and was quite pleased with everything. good service, great food, and brightly lit and welcoming ambience."}
{"text":"Their vegan shawarma and cauliflower wings are delishio......nom nom...and the servers are sweeties....EAT THERE!!!!! NAMASTE XO"}
{"text":"I'm kind of in love with The Coup.

I'll admit - my initial thought of dining at a strictly vegetarian place scared me. What the heck was I going to eat? A quick look at the menu didn't inspire me, but I took my chances and I am SO glad I did! Since that first visit, I've been back 3 more times and I've enjoyed it every time.

The vibe is a little boho/hipster and I assumed that meant the service would be snobby and pretentious - as if they could smell that I was a meat eater from a mile away. Fortunately that was not the case! Every single staff member we encountered was friendly and super helpful, and I actually like the laid back vibe of the place - nobody was judging my after yoga \"glow\" (aka, sweaty and in gym clothes). Anytime there has been a wait, it's gone very quickly - although I've only ever been for lunch. I really love the smoothies of the day, they are always so yummy! The drink menu is expansive and they are really accommodating to substitution requests or dietary restrictions. 

Everything I've tried so far has been amazing! The Green House Effect salad is absolutely delicious - the balsamic dijon dressing is to die for. I also really, really love the Grilled Treehouse Sandwich (with egg) - perfect brunch meal but pretty messy and a little difficult to eat. The panini's are also delicious, as is the soup. The last time I was there, our server didn't bring our drinks out for a while and brought me soup instead of salad - mistakes happen, and they were nice enough to keep the soup on the table so we could enjoy that too (free of charge). Sure, it's a little pricey...but isn't all healthy food these days? The portions are huge so I always end up taking some home for later.

Overall, I absolutely love The Coup and I know I'll be returning time and time again."}
{"text":"A great vegetarian place to go to! They've done a good job on adapting to Asian and East Indian cuisine. I got the beach front hot pot! Very tasty and colourful. Good variety of vegetables but the broth was quite think, it felt like more of a sauce instead, couldn't call it a hotpot!"}
{"text":"Vegan Charcuterie board: all amazing, great smoky flavors, great cheese, weird watermelon prosciutto but it works with the other contents of the board

Vegan hot pot: great thick broth with thick rice noodles, there is nothing about this dish I don't like 

Woodsomething s'more cake like thing: it comes with fire to create a campfire smell, and man, it is amazing, super esthetically pleasing"}
{"text":"Décor - 5/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 3/5
Price - 2/5

If I could give it 3.5 stars, this would be 3.5 stars based on the above criteria. As one of the only vegetarian/vegan restaurants in Calgary, the Coup satisfies with its innovative and creative spins on veg based foods. High on flavor, they manage to make even plant burgers juicy and veggie hot pot's rich and nourishing. While this is a great thing, I also struggle slightly with how oily some items are. I get that there is a struggle to make vegan cuisine more inclusive for all diets but when I go for healthy, clean vegan, I want just that. Still, The Coup does deliver on having much healthier options than most restaurants in Calgary and you COULD choose a salad instead of the hotpot (but where is the fun in that?!).  Price wise, it is slightly high especially when you're ordering a sandwich with a couple strips of tempeh. But again, it is one of the few vegan restaurants in Calgary and in a very prime location, so I guess that justifies the cost. Despite the price though, I would still and have kept coming back."}
{"text":"Hiiiiiiighly recommend this joint to anyone who is a vegetarian... and even those that are not.  In town for the week for work, and had planned to have dinner at Market on 17th.  After perusing their menu and not finding much for non-meat eaters, I wandered down the street and noticed The Coup.  It was jam packed on a Wednesday eve and I took that as a good sign.  The menu is full of so many items that sound delicious, it was hard to choose.  Finally settled on a limeade and a magic dragon bowl, which includes your choice of proteins, grains and sauces.  It was FANTASTIC.  I finished it off as if I hadn't eaten in days.  They know how to do good food here.  Nothing bland about it!  The flavors were perfect.  I concluded with an affogato for dessert which featured coconut gelato.  I'd come here every night if I could.  You won't regret paying a visit to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time tonight after walking past it for years. The food itself was delcious, good mix of flavours. However the dersert we had was the best part. I would rather say thay about the main dinner than the desert it self. The place is decked out a little pretentious but overall if your looking for a different place to eat I'd recommend here."}
{"text":"Amazing place. My fiance and I tried the \"vegan\" lifestyle for a while and tried this place out. It tastes no different then any other food, it didn't even taste vegan, it was amazing especially if your new to being vegan. The drinks were awesome! Great menu and great drink menu. The staff is super friendly, we even asked what her favorite was and went with it, WOW. Great food all around. Give this place a try vegan or not!!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely breaky at the coup.

Food: my el sombrero with smoked tofu was VERY good (can choose between egg or tofu filling) with a side of hash, salsa and sour cream....the salsa had a sweet taste to it and was quite enjoyable. ($13.50).

Friends had the frittata daily special, and mediterranean scramble which both looked very good as well.

Drink: basil lemon-limeade was also very good being the right amount of tartness! ($6.50)

Great food, good service, busy busy, I think we got the last table @ 9:30 am, so go a bit earlier for breakfast/brunch.

Would definitely come back for lunch / dinner."}
{"text":"Tuesday at 5:30pm with a gf. Had a lovely waitress who explained their huge drink menu and was very good about assuring me which items are dairy free. We tried the tempeh sticks - tasty but not a huge fan of them. Texture thing in my part. I'd like to give the cauliflower appie a try next time.

Had a lovely bowl- coconut rice, eggplant peanut salad and mushrooms that looked like scallops. Presentation was beautiful and highest of marks on creativity!!! I'm not vegetarian but I enjoy a meatless meal about twice/week.  My gf had a quinoa veggie and tofu bowl with adobo sauce which she loved. We were so full but I could not resist the lime coconut cashew square- which is actually round haha! Brought it home and devoured it on my own. It was tart in flavour, light like a mousse and decadently rich from the nuts. Wow, great job!!! I will be back to try more items!!! I don't know if there are more veggie places in town but this is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Creative, amazing, great value and great vibe- one of the city's best and the single best pure veg resto I've ever been, ANYWHERE. 

They don't take resos because it's too small- same policy at many little places around the world. You live with this or you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it here. The ambiance, music, food and service was all great. Servers joked with us and totally made it such a welcoming environment. I love when you step into a place and it feels like they're serving you from their own kitchen. 

I can't believe how delicious the veggie burger was! It was phenomenal! 

Also started off with the cauliflower wings. I've had these at a few places before and really enjoyed them! This was no different.

Chai latte was rich and delicious. We never needed to ask for out waters to be refilled because they kindly leave a bottle for people!

I would 10/10 recommend this place to friends!"}
{"text":"Went to the Coup for lunch today (first time since they renovated). It is so much nicer than it used to be. It's more open and roomier.

We had a very nice server who was quick and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. They unfortunately had a temporary problem with the cooker (stove? oven?) today, but that was fine, they still had a number of items available including the quesadilla, salads, sandwiches, etc. I had a delicious sandwich with coconut \"bacon\" and the potato cheese soup was really tasty - one of the best restaurant soups I've ever had.  To drink I had a basil lemon limeade - super refreshing!!

I love this restaurant and need to come here more often!!!!"}
{"text":"Sweet Jesuit Priest do I ever love meat. I mean, I really love it. Eating the flesh of animals is my thing. Steaks, burgers, pork, chicken, emu, lobster, kangaroo, I don't care. I'll eat anything that used to breathe more often than not.

But every now and then I stow my carnivorous German roots away and decide to eat something that didn't once have a face. I've been to the Coup (and the next door adjacent lounge, \"Meet\") a few times now and I've never been disappointed.

See, as someone who is in love with meat (the thought of Lady Gaga's meat dress inspires such overwhelming emotions I can scarce put them to words), it's easy to give vegetarian/vegan places a bad rap.

But this place is great and aside from the prices of their drinks and the smaller portions of their appetizers, it's pretty much the best place in the city for vegetarian and vegan dishes. 

The restaurant is small, so you may want to think about hitting it before or after the rush. Decor is funky, but I don't really go to a restaurant to stare at the decorations, so I'll just leave that one there. The ambience is sort of pretentious, but that's a-okay with me. There's usually a DJ with a hilarious mustache spinning some sort of ambient jazz or something. I appreciate his efforts to set a good mood for the violent consumption of bean sprouts.

Now: When you read the menu, there are going to be words on there you don't understand and vegetables you've never even heard of. DON'T PANIC. Just order something.

I've had sandwiches, salads, breakfast, lunch and dinner here - I've always enjoyed how flavorful the dishes are and how professional the presentation is. Even as someone who normally gorges themselves on delicious animals, I've got to say - well done, Coup. You've made a diet associated with being an enormous hippy-tree-hugger extremely attractive to me.

I usually wash down my uber-healthy meals with a Clockwork Orange. I can't even remember what's in it, but it tastes like rays of sunshine. 

If you've got friends who unfortunately don't see the merits in chomping on a steak, I'd recommend swinging by this place. Just have a thick wallet and an open mind."}
{"text":"The COUP is located on trendy 17th avenue SW right across from the new luxury George condos and they're a vegetarian restaurant with an intimate atmosphere that serves fresh, whole, organic and local drink and food.

They've been around for a while but I haven't really had a reason to visit. I've heard good things but I love my meat. Recently, some friends on different occasions have been telling me they want to cut down on meat or even cut it out completely...I found it to be odd that within 1 week, 4 friends have mentioned this to me and I thought to myself \"WHAT'S GOING ON, YA'LL CRAY!!!!!!!!\" Anyway, out of the 4 friends, one was my BFF and her birthday happen to be right around the corner so we decided to try The Coup. 

It was a Wednesday just after 6PM - we got a parking spot right in front of the resto on the street for free. When we entered, we were greeted right away and sat at the two top literally right beside the entrance. Initially I was a little bummed because there was another side that seem to be more intimate and bumpin' but our seats were fine. I couldn't scope out much of the restaurant but there was an open concept bar right when you enter. Our server quickly gave us menus and brought a glass bottle of water. There was a feature special which was a quinoa and carrot burger with your choice of side. I couldn't make up my mind (as per usual) on what I wanted for a main, so we ordered a couple appies - eggplant sleeping bags and tandoori cauliflower wings which we were told is their best seller.

Our server was great, I asked for some recommendations because I wanted something sufficient so I wouldn't leave hungry but nothing seemed to stand out for me. Appetizers came quick and to be honest at first look I wasn't impressed with the eggplant sleeping bags because they were tiny! The eggplant sleeping bags is fresh herbs & spicy cashew pesto wrapped in grilled and chilled eggplant - they packed a lot of flavor in those tiny rolls, the cashew bits added some crunch which was nice - wouldn't order again though. The cauliflower 'wings' were super tasty - cauliflower rolled in chickpea flour, baked, sauced and served with a side of chermoula. The coating was super light and the sauce had Indian curry spices which was great. The chermoula is green sauce that's a blend of many different herbs and spices that was refreshing.

I FINALLY decided on my main and went the Magic Dragon Bowl which allowed me to 'choose my own adventure'. Choice of either: tofu, chickpeas, lentils then a base of organic wild rice or quinoa and lastly, the sauce: tahini miso topped with seeds or spicy almond topped with slivered almonds. All of this came with steamed and sautéed season vegetables and kale. I went with tofu, wild rice aaaaaaand AGAIN I couldn't make up my mind for the sauce so our server suggested have both on the side. BFF went with the featured special with soup.

Mains came out at a decent time and they looked awesome! BFF's burger was open faced with spring and micro greens on one pattie and the quinoa carrot burger with some kind of cheese, house made guacamole, cilantro and onions on the other pattie. The soup was spicy roasted red pepper.  My dragon bowl was in a huge ceramic bowl with the sauces on the side. The tahini miso sauce had a punch and was served cold while the spicy almond sauce was warm, oily but absolutely DELICIOUS - you have to give it a good stir but it naturally separates. It wasn't spicy at all, more of a satay paste...I could drink it. I'm so glad she brought out both because I was originally going to go with the tahini and I didn't love it - strong tahini flavor with the miso punch. The almond sauce went so well with my bowl, I was very impressed. Fresh sautéed vegetables with cubes of tofu and rice - YUM! BFF really enjoyed her burger, she mentioned it was moist, packed a lot of flavor and the guacamole really brought everything together. She wasn't a big fan of the soup as it was spicier than she anticipated. We finished with the woodland for dessert: maple graham cake layered with salted dark chocolate ganache, toasted house marshmallow, cherry bark, smoked birch-walnut caramel sap, balsam fir camp fire. Presentation was interesting, they had a little fire on the plate that naturally went out. It looked different than I envisioned - I didn't have any but BFF said that the texture was similar to a dense date bar and it was really rich. She liked it but she wouldn't order it again.

Overall, our experience was great! I didn't have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised. Service was wonderful, attentive and very kind. Prices are reasonable. Food was really great, we found everything to be very well seasoned and sufficient for not having any meat. We left very satisfied and happy. I am now a BELIEVER that vegetarian food can be fun, hearty and tasty. I will return!"}
{"text":"I went there with my lovely girlfriend 3 weeks ago. It caught our attention as a lot of people were standing in line for the opening and decided to give it a try later. (we're from Edmonton) we got there at 7 and it was still jam packed and we were told there was a 35 minute wait, which turned out to be only 15.

The staff was genuinely friendly, they made us feel like regular. During our evening we encountered 4 of them and I'd say the same for everyone of them.

We ordered the hot pot and the eggplant burger. It was very good, super tasty. The portion were big enough to be full but not enough to feel like a glutton. I'd say for the portion it's a bit pricey but the GF says that's the price for that kind of food."}
{"text":"An upscale vegetarian restaurant with full bar is cool - not many of those... The food was good. I'm not a vegetarian - maybe among vegetarians it's a standout. I felt the prices were a bit high given the ingredients.

I had the Dragon bowl with quinoa and sesame-nori dressing. The dressing was mild - I'd have liked stronger flavor (those who love sesame and seaweed know what I'm talking about). The vegetables were a nice mix and cooked just right. I left nothing behind. The waitstaff were friendly and professional. They let me take my time even though the place was starting to get busy on Friday night. Not too hip as folks have stated, not unhip - just about right.

The final word - I'd recommend the Coup. Maybe not to a crowd of carnivore-types, but for those wanting a back to the earth flavor and willing to go without meat - it's sure to please."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I love trying any vegan/vegetarian restaurant when I travel or am in my own city- Calgary.  I hadn't been back to the Coup in about 7 years because it was not good when I first went.  Sadly I still don't think it's great.  Everything sounds good but isn't executed properly. The decor is very nice with a living wall of herbs and a hippy laid back vibe. I tried 3 dishes. 1: the messy jessy - potatoes, sun dried tomatoes, smoked tofu with a miso gravy.  It was decent but there was WAY to much miso gravy which made it incredibly salty- instant BP booster;)  2: The poached which is their version of eggs benny. I liked that it was on a biscuit and the pumpkin pesto sounded neat however there was an overpowering taste of goat cheese!!! BAAAAAD  3: the vegan broccoli cheddar soup.  I'm not sure if the server had the name of the soup wrong but there was no broccoli.. anywhere. It was bland and borrrrrring.  Once again I'm disappointed in the veggie options compared to other cities who really know how to execute this style of cooking. It may be another 7 years before my return."}
{"text":"The absolute most delicious vegetarian restaurant food I've ever had!

Personally, I'm not a vegetarian, and I actually love meat. But after eating a lot of heavy food and steak while visiting family in Calgary, I wanted something different - and lighter. This place was an amazing contrast to the beef-heavy diet visitors to Alberta are most likely to be met with. 

Food here is also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I first experienced The Coup after a friend heard me complaining that Calgary didn't have any good places for a vegan to eat. October 2006 was my first experience at the coup and I was forever grateful to Jane for telling me about this place/taking me here. Between the first visit and when I moved to Ontario in 2010, I tried to eat here at least once on every trip to Calgary - eventually I discovered that their weekend breakfast was their best offering and made an effort to make my visits early enough to get something of that menu.

Not only is the food great and the service legit, but I really enjoy their philosophy on food and life. I appreciate their cash only approach to things, their local food goals and the act that they try to reduce their environmental impact as much as possible - it's nice to know a restaurant is cognizant of their footprint.

All in all, breakfast is the star here, but lunch and dinner is decent. I find this place is best for smaller groups 2-4 and there can often be a significant wait, but I've never had a bad experience.

The next time I end up in Calgary I'll be stopping by."}
{"text":"After attending The Coup way too much in the past couple of weeks I feel the need to update my love. 
When we went to The Coup following my convocation, we received lovely service as always. My little brother is a dear, and when I was in the washroom, purchased a copy of The Coup cookbook for me, which awaited my return on the table. That weekend I immediately took it home and cooked up my beloved Upstream burgers! Sooo happy. This cookbook rules, and is super charming as it tells the story of how The Coup came to be. While most of the recipes for my favourite vegan menu items are included in this cookbook, I will still continue to frequent The Coup for the cozy little atmosphere and wonderful service. Just wanted to plug their wonderful cookbook!
Also, I am not sure if I mentioned this in my earlier review as this may not have come into fruition yet, but the teas The Coup serves are actually those of The Naked Leaf in Calgary, my favourite organic teashop. Therefore, you can support two local businesses in one visit! Charming! :)

{"text":"Just had a great frittata here. It changes every day. My wife had the beach front hot pot and my son the grilled treehouse sandwich. Absolutely delicious and fresh. The coconut bacon was a bit sweet for my liking but would make a great dessert. If you are thinking of trying a vegetarian lifestyle or are just interested try this place! Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Five stars for the (in-season) locally-sourced and organic produce, the composting, the recycling, the vision, and the stand for excellent, fresh, socially responsible vegetarian food in Calgary.

Three-and-a-half-to-four stars for the good.  It was all good, but it wasn't great.  I liked it; didn't love it.  It wasn't -- \"OMG I can't believe the flavors and the depth\".  We shared a salad -- the Green House Effect -- and two entrees, the Falafel Quesadilla and the Greek Goddess.  

We added tempeh croutons to our Green House Effect salad (which normally comes on another salad but we wanted to try them) which added something extra.  Other than that, the salad was among the most routine on the menu.  The dressings were great.  The sesame lemongrass vinigrette and the maple balsamic were delicious.  The Falafel Quesadilla wasn't really a quesadilla at all.  Rather, it was like a salad wrapped in a sprouted tortilla.  Still, it was good (again, not great, though I would order it again).  The Greek Goddess was also good, but just a tad on the boring side.  Its foundation was rice and lentils with some other stuff thrown in, like kalamata olives.

One thing that I DIDN'T LIKE about The Coup is that there seemed to be an extra charge for EVERYTHING.  Because we were sharing, we have them split the Greek Goddess into two bowls.  $2 extra.  We tried two salad dressings instead of one -- $1.50 extra.  The tempeh croutons -- $3 extra. I I have NEVER been charged extra for trying an additional salad dressing at any restaurant in my life.  To boot, the size of the salad dressing was tiny.  For $1.50?? It's a bit nickel-and-dime, no?  The salad, as we got it, was $15.50 instead of its original $11.  That's a bit dear, eh?

We got the chocolate sorbet for dessert.  It's not homemade, and it's not worth getting.  Skip it.

The space is small, and, from what I'm told, usually crowded.  We lucked out and got a seat right away at 9:20p on a Tuesday.

All-in-all, I will forgive the trangressions of over-padding the bill because I strongly believe in the what The Coup represents.  As far as I can discern, there are only three dedicated vegetarian restaurants in Calgary.  God-speed, The Coup, in tranforming cattle-ranching country into a more ecologically-conscious and socially-responsible society."}
{"text":"Omg. So so so good. I ordered the tempeh shawarma and I couldn't get enough! And their oyster mushroom bacon?!  so much flavour and aroma!!! It's to die for, seriously. Such a nice chill spot to catch up with my sister  beautiful decorations and awesome chill vibe, and all the waitresses and servers are so happy and polite :)"}
{"text":"Being Vegan in this town isn't easy - Vancouver transplant. But, for the limited options, this place is the cats patoot. Prices are fair, staff is generally awesome. The dude abides."}
{"text":"For years the Coup has been Calgary's go-to for vegetarian cuisine. 
I'm far from vegetarian, but the Coup satisfies that occassional need to eat food that feels restorative and delicious. The flavours are big and satistying and I don't miss the meat any time I've powered down all those macro and micro nutrients."}
{"text":"Pretty busy here but the bar seats are usually available it seems. I am not sure why people don't like the bar seats, the waitress was very nice and helpful. Did a wonderful job :)

Vegetarian paradise it seems. Even for non-vegetarians this has some good choices. Really enjoyed the mushroom faux gras cigars and the the upstream burger. Never had such a unique vegetarian burger and the garlic Aioli is to die for. I could spread that on anything! 

Only thing that wasn't my cup of tea was the cajun tempeh sticks. To be honest I still don't know what a tempeh is. The place is pretty noisy though but good atmosphere.

Maybe I need to get out more often but I've never had a affogado before (espresso over coconut gelato). Not sure what it was but it worked. Could be a drink, could be  dessert. Quite a pleasant surprise!

Vegetarian or not, try this place."}
{"text":"STEPH JUDGEMENT: Creative, delicious vegetarian/vegan food and cocktails with great service and ambiance.

For our last night in Calgary we wanted a pretty nice dinner. Yelp gave us several suggestions but this place went right to the top of the list because it was vegetarian/vegan and had such good reviews. We made reservations, which was a good thing because the place isn't very large and was packed. It had that retro-mod but slightly rustic look with lots of wood and plants, which was stylish yet still friendly and cozy. They also had a live DJ spinning some loungey electronic music, which was a nice touch. We got seated at one of the tall communal tables by the windows, which turned out to be a good place to see what's going on in the resto as well as the outside. 

We started out with a couple of cocktails, which turned out to be really well-made and delicious. Then we chose a variety of items from the menu to share--everything was really great, with just a minor quibble with a sushi roll's rice being a little too al dente. It was really exciting for the bf to know that he could order anything on the menu. For the record, everything is vegetarian, but not necessarily vegan, but they can make a lot of the items vegan so there is that. The meal and service were wonderful. I think this place is a must-visit in Calgary for any vegetarian or vegan (or even an omnivore who just likes tasty food)."}
{"text":"I am not vegetarian or vegan but the Coup is absolutely WONDERFUL and I come here with tons of my vegan friends all the time. The brunch service and the dinner service is both amazing. The whole place is very aesthetic and the staff are warm and welcoming.

My favorite to order here is the tree house sandwich with the coconut bacon, it never fails to amaze me, I don't know if they change the recipe every so often but I feel like it gets better every time. You can make almost any dish vegan and gluten-free.

It can get a little loud and hard to hear other people but the lighting provides an intimate feel to the place. 

This is a great place to bring family and friends! The prices aren't that bad too!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my family.  There were five of us and so the wait was quite long (about 45min).  They put us near the back of the restaurant and so my mom being in a wheelchair, had a difficult time maneuvering through the entrance and people's coats, purses, chairs, etc.  Nuts are everywhere on the menu so I'd pretty much stay away if you are allergic.  I could actually smell it in the air while there.

Our server was quite friendly and informed us the kitchen was a little backed up so we should order quick (thank you!).  I tried the banh mi and was surprised to find the bread wasn't in a more traditional bun.  It seemed like they used a dinner roll / burger bun.  The initial response was, wtf?  However, after the first bite I was pleasantly surprised at the flavour.  There were lots of nuts so you'll be picking your teeth afterwards.

It was quite expensive so I don't know if this will be a regular staple for me.  It's good to know the option is there for a late dinner or somewhere to bring a vegan friend."}
{"text":"Review #3 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge

The Coup is definitely my favourite restaurant in Calgary now. I lived here a few years ago and the menu was all right back then, but it seems they have overhauled it now and put some new entrees and appetizers on the menu.  The portions are great and they have a wider variety. 

Another big thing is they finally made it easier to veganize everything. Before almost everything had cheese in it and there was no vegan Daiya cheese option.  Also for breakfast almost everything had eggs in it. 

So I am really impressed and I don't feel they're only catering to vegetarians and omnivores anymore. Dishes taste great when they are ordered vegan as well. 

So far since I've moved back I've gone a handful of times and tried the following dishes:

Baked Rosemary Yam Fries - a little different than they used to be, they give you bigger ones and less of them now. The miso gravy is more like a very thick dip, all right but not my favorite. 

Upstream burger - not bad, a little bit squishy as it's made from yams. It tasted good but I found that the focaccia bread was way too giant for the patty. I would like it on ciabatta more. Comes with salad or yam fries, so it's good. 

The Grazer Burger - the tempeh comes in some sort of barbecue sauce that is delicious. It would be awesome with 3 strips instead of 2. The saurkraut is pretty good, not too sour.  I got it without horseradish for my preference.  It's served on toasted ciabatta, so it's very filling.  I really like this sandwich. 

Pasta' Buck - really flavorful and inventive pasta.  It almost tasted like penne carbonara with the sundried tomatoes having a tangy flavor in place of bacon. The smoked tofu is really good.  This dish was so filling I had to take half of it home!

Beachfront Hot Pot - this is the only dish I wouldn't get again. It was kind of weird. I love coconut soup and noodle soup and tons of veggies, but it just had an odd flavor to it. The lotus root is really hard and it's not something I'm sure you're used to eating before. I think if it was more flavored like a coconut curry or just a vegan pho it would be better. 

There's a few more items I'd like to try on the menu, but I usually stick to the entrees as they're more filling, and as a vegan chef I'm used to eating a lot of salads and steamed veggie bowls at home already. 

Their drinks like the vegan hot chocolate (with almond milk) and pear ginger cider are good, they're just so darn expensive. So I just wish their non alcoholic beverages weren't so pricy, it's a little too much. 

The staff are really friendly and even at closing they don't mind if you sit and chat for a few minutes so I didn't feel any pressure to pay the bill and leave right away."}
{"text":"Came here with a vegetarian friend and we both felt the same way - the food was good, but the overall feel was a little.. fabricated. Of course this is only my opinion, but I didn't like the feel or the attitude of the people there. For whatever reason, that bothers me, but the food is quite good and flavourful and sometimes you are forgetting you are eating a vegetarian/vegan meal."}
{"text":"I have been here time and time again and have had nothing but delicious food and excellent service. For people complaining about price, all of their prices are reasonable for the portion and quality received! For those complaining about wait times, get there earlier? It's always full because it's outstanding vegetarian food and friendly staff. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Im a fan of this place. 
Food is pretty good and as a meat eater( hard to make me eat veggies) , i am usually uber picky! 
This place has helped me appreciate vegetarian food so much more. 

The price is right! Atmosphere is cozy and just the right amount of noise!

I would recommend this to any one. Especially those who are making the switch to eating healthier and with a more vegetarian / vegan focus!"}
{"text":"The Coup doesn't lie when they say they are a vegan restaurant.  Their menu is full of meatless, milkless, tasteless food.  It serves the perfect food for a cow or maybe a goat.

It's not that I'm against veganism or vegetarianism or anything like that.  In fact, I'm not the biggest fan of meat, but I am a fan of flavour.  I find that, even though the meals are interesting and different, they are quite bland and not very filling.  All the dishes are quite extreme with very random ingredients; stuff you wouldn't expect to find in edible food.

Okay, maybe I'm being a little too harsh.  This place really is the perfect little restaurant for people who don't eat meat or just want to eat a little healthier.  They don't use any grease or additives in their meals so they really are good for you.  

I'm just not quite a fan of the place because of the lack of flavour and zing!  Perhaps if I enjoyed eating grass a little more I'd like the place enough.  As it is, I prefer a little more taste in my dishes."}
{"text":"This place does deserve a re-review just because I have been trying more and more of their menu and have been loving almost every dish! They have revamped their menu since I first tried it several years ago and it has been for the better. I love that they focus on health without compromising taste. They got rid of one of my favourite sauces (the peanut sauce, they said it had too much maple syrup/too much sugar) and replaced it with a healthier version of it (using almond butter and no sugar whatsoever!) and it actually tastes even better! Definitely recommend getting one or two appies to share. I love the tempeh sticks, one-straw sushi, yam fries and cauliflower bites. Their tzatziki is delicious and recommend you try the vegan version (made with cashew cream instead of sour cream). 

They have a very creative cocktail menu that I have yet to try as my favourite drink is their chai latte made with almond milk, it is just too warm and cozy to pass up. I just love the overall atmosphere of the place and hip, friendly staff. If you check them out on instagram you will get a sneak peak of their daily dinner feature. 

This place has expanded my meat-eating palette and urge my other meat-eating friends to also come in with an open mind, you will definitely be surprised!"}
{"text":"Really cute restaurant which has seating for only 32.  It took about 15-20 minutes for us to get a seat, but the staff were nice and the food was pretty good.  I ordered the Beachfront hotpot, which was a coconut curry with pho type noodles, lotus, edamame, sliced carrot, and some other veggies.  It was pretty tasty, was hoping for more noodles though!  My coworkers ordered the pear, caramelized onion and brie sandwich (and they said it was good!) and my other coworker ordered a falafel and hummus quesadilla (strange combo of ethnicities).  

The drinks here are also great - for example, basil lemon lime ade.  A lot of unique drinks that I haven't seen elsewhere.  

I would say the veggie food at this place is much better than Gratitude Cafe in Kensington.  

Lots of homemade bags hung around the restaurant in lieu of your typical artwork on canvases.  

And one last observation: when we ate here, everyone in the restaurant was female!  i'd never seen anything like it!"}
{"text":"My go-to for delicious vegetarian food, which can be somewhat hard to find in Calgary. Even my meat-eating boyfriend really enjoys the place. The service is friendly and warm, the prices aren't bad and the atmosphere is nice.  I particularly love the peanut satay bowl."}
{"text":"Clearly everyone in Calgary who's vegetarian knows about this place, because it came recommended to me by hotel staff and strangers alike when I mentioned I was looking for a cool veg place to eat while in town on business. The food was fresh and creative, with an impressive array of entrees to choose from. There were four of us and we each ordered something different, promising to share so that we could all get a taste (check the pics I've added on the listing)! Amazing food!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian it is great to be able to come to the Coup as they have so many options for someone who is either Vegetarian or Vegan.  I go to the coup several times a month for breakfast and I am always very happy.  It is great for Dinner as well or even just for drinks."}
{"text":"You know these places that are at the top of their game.  All around great reviews.  Great service.  Great food.  Great presentation.  Fair prices.  Great drinks etc.  Well, here's another.  

We tried the cauliflower wings and cajun tempeh sticks.  My wife really enjoyed the wings.  She thought they where great.  I though the tempeh sticks took the gold.  Both had been packed with flavor.  Wish we had more time in the area to have gone back to try a few other offerings.  

The portion sizes seemed huge.  That's the one plus side to eating veg.  :-)  It looked like a lot of area veg heads.  Not so many out of towners.  The folks next to us had an order that was on the old menu.  We opted for a corner spot at the bar with a view of the entire place.  People waited to get in over the course of our entire visit.  

Men scattered about but by in large female clientele.  I felt like a bull in a china shop.  But I'm used to it  and was happy to partake in some really great vegetarian food.  We are just plain old starved for variety in Whitefish MT. 

We ordered some mint juleps (not a menu option).  They missed the mark by a landslide.  Even an extra shot of bourbon failed to fix it.

But by and large a really great place to eat.  Staff was warm and friendly.  Food was really great.  They really are a vegetarian stronghold and we are glad to have had the opportunity to support them.  

Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I enjoyed my meal both times but the service is not really match the food. Waiting time is very long and so as waiting for something you asked for, like sugar for your coffee. I will go there if I have plenty of time and not very hungry to help me bear the long waiting time."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what it is. Not bad but still probably the worst-tasting (very bland and small portions) and the most expensive vegetarian place I've been to. Forget about happy hours, they don't have it. Very nice employees but the suggested tip is 20%. The insane price of the dumb food gets in the way of me wanting to tip the nice employees. 20%... is u srs"}
{"text":"Always so good every time! Its by far one of my favourite vegetarian restaurants in the country!"}
{"text":"The level of thoroughness and sophistication in the food makes it one of the best restaurants I've been to in Alberta the past week. They source their ingredients locally and fresh, making for tasteful and responsibly-made food. Also, their juices, teas, and lattes had lots of non-dairy flexibility (the almond milk iced chai latte was unbelievable!!) and a wide range of unique options for everyone.

Personally, my favorite thing about this restaurant is the extent of its environmental awareness about its ingredients, to-go packaging, waste (even their receipts and menus), and energy use, AND they devote a portion of their profit to feeding healthy food to people in need.  

Overall, if I lived here in Calgary, I'd either work here or come here way too much for my breakfast, lunch, and dinner."}
