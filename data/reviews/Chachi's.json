{"text":"I can't believe I was given Moldy bread and she looked at me like I was crazy pointing to her the green and blue mark on the side. I'm super upset and disgusted by this. I got my money back but I ate part of this bread meaning I am most likely going to get food poisoning ! Alberta health services needs to go and check this place out. And on top of that she didn't even add chips on my Mac an cap she messed up everything. DONT GO HERE. I mean that's just wrong. And she tried arguing me which is terrible service will report."}
{"text":"Located up the escalator to the terminals (it's on the left), they have sandwiches, salads, and overpriced water. Their own water (which tastes like tap in a bottle) is $2. I got a grilled cheese sandwich. It was interesting (lots of cheeses though not a lot of cheese) in that it had a fig chutney on it. The bread was odd (more of a sub sandwich bread) and it was served so hot that I had to sit at one of their few tables (5 or so) until it cooled enough to eat. Once it did, I wish I hadn't eaten it. My stomach is upset and my advice is to skip this place and wait to eat until you're inside security. The options seem much better."}
{"text":"I actually really like there sandwiches, I only have them 1-2 times a year though, cause I'm not really big on sandwiches haha, the Mac and cheese is usually delicious as well."}
{"text":"Something about a menu written on a chalk board screams yummy yuppie fresh ingredients and of coarse I had to try it.  I order the turkey sandwich for my lunch. Smoked turkey with lettuce tomato red onions spicy mayo and fig chutney. Sounded good.   First off the bun was warm and soft and fresh. Actually all the ingredients were fresh and tasty but unfortunately the fig chutney was just way to overwhelming. Instead of a savoury sweet sandwich it was mostly sweet that came through. I would order from here again maybe even the same sandwich only definitely sans fig."}
{"text":"My husband always raves about Chachi's and I can see why.   I ordered the Montreal smoked meat for $10. It came with nothing else but the sandwich (can anyone answer why local foods are more expensive...?). I thought this was pretty pricey considering I could get a combo for the same price anywhere else.   However, Chachi's truly delivers on freshness and flavor. The meat was seasoned perfectly and moist. They added the perfect amount of yellow mustard and the ciabatta bun, unlike the cardboard monstrosities offered at Timmie's, was pillowy and soft. However I was still hungry after eating the entire sandwich.   I've had their Kale salad before and it was lackluster for the high price they charged. The veg was fresh but it wasn't mind blowing.   I would totally get Chachi's again but considering the  price and smaller portion, it would only be as a treat."}
{"text":"Chachi's is a small sandwich place located in the shopping mall food courts in Canada. It serves craft gourmet sandwiches with local ingredients. There are many locations in Calgary, AB and Vancouver, BC areas. My boyfriend and I went to the mall on Sunday and We stopped by Chachi's to have our lunch. It was our first time having food at Chachi's. The same as other restaurants in the food court, we ordered the sandwiches at the front desk of the shop and then waited for our food at the court. We had ordered $10 Pork w/ Mac, which made by tender pulled pork, sweet chili bbq sauce, topped with mac'n cheese. and their weekly special sandwich. Our sandwiches were delicious and tasty. We were very happy to try healthy sandwiches. We had a great time eating our sandwichs from Chachi's."}
{"text":"Flight checklist:  Spicy Italian sandwich from Chachis ID Boarding pass Phone Gum....  In that order!!!  Sometime ago this place turned into a mandatory pre flight stop.  It's just a chain deli spot but it is also the best food option in the airport (honourable mention Jugo juice) and having some real food makes a long flight that much better.  Carry it on.  It tastes better after it's been through the X-ray machine- fact.  Chachis is down at the westjet end of the airport on the departures level.   Hold the onions as a courtesy to your fellow passengers."}
{"text":"I had an extended layover here, when I missed my connecting flight. After examining the eating options on both sides of security, I went with Chachi's as my dinner option. I love a good sandwich. I went with the Clubbin' sammy, with bacon, turkey, lettuce, tomat, cheddar, garlic aioli and spicy mayo.  The sandwich was quick, served warm and fresh! The bread was firm, but soft, plenty of filling, and just what I needed. My only regret was that I didn't have room to also order the mac n' cheese! I really wanted to try it!   I also see that they have a counter in West Edmonton Mall, which makes me so happy! I am in this area all the time, so I can try more items on the menu! Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!!.. I had the vedge and the grilled cheese and both were delicious!... I look forward to try other sandwiches! The bread was very fresh and all the sandwich was very tasty... Even when I'm not a big fan of sandwiches I really liked chachis and I can go back there for lunch or even an informal supper... This place is waaaay better than most franchises!!"}
{"text":"I came to Crossiron for the 1st time yesterday, and I was happy to see gluten free sandwiches.  I ordered a veg sandwich, because I mainly eat a vegetarian diet.  The sandwich was delicious, but I asked for avocado which wasn't added.  Delicious peach lemonade.  I'd eat there again still since the staff was very polite."}
