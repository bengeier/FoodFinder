{"text":"Came for Sunday Brunch. Arrived 5 minutes early and there was already a line. Luckily I got seated right away. My friend and I ordered a latte and a ginger tea. We shared their baked eggs of the day, the rajasthani eggs and a half order of their french toast (stuffed with brie and sour cherry). My only regret was not taking a picture before I ate! The food was delicious and fresh. I loved everything we ordered. The regularly changing menu of specials will keep me coming back regularly! The meal was pretty cheap considering how much we ate! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love the aesthetic, the unique menu, the design, the space, the staff, i even love waiting outside and browsing apt909 next door, but at the end of the day everything I've ordered from Saving Grace has needed a pillar of salt to be palatable. I want to love it, but I can't; the food is a little too bland."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food.  It's awesome.  I can't dock them stars for being so popular that you have to wait to get in.  I believe it was Cliff Claven who said of a bar that wasn't Cheers, \"no one goes there any more.  It's too crowded.\"  

I've always had good service, and I've been about ten times.  Maybe I've just been in less of a rush than other reviewers.  Who's in a rush at brunch, anyway?

Tip: unless the weather sucks, get a latte and a scone from Ella's Uncle across the street while you wait for a table.  Makes the wait a pleasure."}
{"text":"My young son and I was so excited to try Saving Grace with all the great review from others,  but have been mention it be a long wait.  We arrive there at 9:40 which we we're the second one in line.  This place have very bad business organization, for the second person inline we we're the last to place our order.  We got seated on the left side while all the last minute people was seated to the right and got serve first.  By the time we got our food it was over a hour and my son was Hungry but we by then we had to leave so we ended up packing to go.  

So I recommend to go when you have a whole day to waste and have a bagel before you go.  Please make sure if u are the first in line to ask before u get seated which side are they taking the order because even if ur first u maybe the last to be serve.  

I can't comment if the food is good or not because the experience had given me a bad taste in my mouth.  But my son love the smoothie, which even when he finish it his food haven't even arrive yet. That's why I give a extra half star for their drink."}
{"text":"summary:

- sure their food is pretty good, but nothing OUTSTANDING
- i say this especially because of the wait time; it is just NOT worth it (think: waiting for almost 1.5 hours with only 6 pairs in front of you.. WTF?!)
- they seem to be very inefficient: letting people sit for LONG LONG periods, taking forever to clear tables for the next people, etc.

they also stopped taking people at 2:30 pm. hey, saving grace - how about you up the service/efficiency so that you can make more money? and maybe give a time limit for people.. which is especially important at a no-reservation-taking joint. 

will i go back? maybe. but most likely not. and i'm happy with that. 

saving grace = womp womp, but you get 3 stars for your food being decent"}
{"text":"It reminds me of one of the smaller brunch places in the Los Feliz/Silverlake/Melrose area in LA. It's actually part of Little Portugal and the place appeared a bit run-down from the outside. It was remarkably popular, especially among young people. 

They really took the time to make sure the food tasted good and was nicely presented. My friend ordered a quesadilla with a spicy apple sauce. It was huge and tasty. I loved my waffles with freshly cut peaches and a blueberry butter on the side. There were simply too many things to choose from!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots in Toronto.  Star off because it is usually SO BUSY.  If I come here on a weekend,  I always plan to arrive right when it opens at 10am, otherwise you will be waiting.  Weekdays are a good bet, I've never had to wait.   I love their lattes and they always have a mouthwatering list of daily specials."}
{"text":"Great food. Awful, terrible service. 

Our meal was delicious. Unfortunately we couldn't enjoy it because the waitress was so rude. Ask for a water refill and expect dirty looks. 

When our food arrived, my bacon was on my boyfriend's plate of pancakes, dripping in syrup. It was hard enough to flag down the waitress, but when I asked if it was my bacon on his plate, she said \"yeah\" and walked away. 

Find a better restaurant that values your business."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Toronto!! Saving Grace requires a weekly visit...Open only till only 3pm, and usually a line-up out the door on weekends. They have a delicious regular menu and an amazing endless list of creative daily specials. The staff are really friendly and efficient, and the coffee and fresh juices are to die for!!  

The Japanese Pancake is on the menu only once every three months, and it's my favorite so far.

The corn pancakes with berries (pancakes with actual pieces of corn in the batter) were today's favorite. 

Off the regular menu, the french toast with gruyere is delicious as is the Angela sandwich!!

The One Love smoothie (blueberry and guava) non-dairy is a must.

Everything I've tried at Saving Grace meets my expectations - Sweet and Savory."}
{"text":"Unlike most of the previous reviewers, I've never had to wait to get a table here.  It may be the type A bent of my personality and those I eat brunch with, but we always seem to be there when it opens or shortly thereafter! On the other hand, we might just be lucky.  The food is always delicious and gives me ideas for things to try out at home.  I will agree though that a little dash of salt would add a little more depth to the food from time to time."}
{"text":"cons: had to wait for almost an hour, was told to wait outside in the cold (understandable because of the small space), our mains took a while because it got \"lost\" but they found it 

Pros: fresh foods, real hearty ingredients, fresh toast is really yummy, good ambience, fast service"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a lovely time here. It was my first time and I really enjoyed it. Cute little spot, nice artwork and I really liked their dishes. 

I loved the menu so I practically ordered everything. I really liked their juice and smoothie selection :) 

Our server and food runners were really sweet although my friend and I kept having to ask them for milk, ketchup, hot sauce. 

I liked how the mirrors were angled."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Seriously bad...we put our name on the list and were told 40 minute wait...came back literally 20minutes later and they looked at us like we were aliens...and responded we are closed. Are you f*cking kidding me!? Horrible.... Will never come back here...not to mention they have a conditional health permit with circled pest control and food handling problems. Gross! No thank you...."}
{"text":"Oh wow. My favourite brunch spot in the city. Expect lines, but it's so worth it, just pop inside and write your name down on the clip board. We always get a half order of french toast on the side. One down side is that service is spotty.

pro tip: going later will ensure you don't have lines but your favourite menu item might be out for the day!"}
{"text":"I was after 10 days low carb diet! And I had my cheat day!
So I went to blogto and searched for best pancakes.. However I came and I ordered amazing french toast with caramelized bananas and maple syrup + espressado 
One word = AMAZING. Huge portion! I was enjoying this meal kind a long..
And I fell in love with the guy who served me ( Hello mr. Handsome :))) 
Only thing - they gave me a bill without asking for it. Sounds weird but I was enjoying my stay there and then BOOM - bill! I felt like they are kicking my out. At least I could go for a nice walk to digest this awesome cheating breakfast!"}
{"text":"Really great, quaint breakfast joint! Incredibly friendly staff that serves you delicious food. What more can you ask for? The Caramelized Bananas & French Toast were absolutely amazing. The cappuccino was also a fantastic addition. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Got there early (10:20-ish) as read in other reviews that this place fills up fast and were lucky to be seated right away as the restaurant was already almost full. They did have people wait out in the cold if they arrived when the restaurant was full, so I recommend going early or bundling up! 
The food selection was delicious. We looked directly at the specials menu and ordered the open omelette with caramelized onions, ch√®vre and herbes de provence served with a side salad, potatoes and toast and the carrot cake waffles with cream cheese, maple syrup and walnuts: highly recommended. All the choices sounded delicious, so it was truly hard to decide! 
To drink we split an avocado espresso smoothie which was delicious but definitely filling so recommend splitting it. 
Service was nothing special, very much a \"take your order, bring your food and that's it\". This didn't bother me because we were there for the food and not for the service. Needless to say if there was a flaw it would be that the wait time for food was a little long, and the bussing time for the plates also took a little while.
Overall a very pleasant experience, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Terrific food in a casual,  stripped down and unpretentious environment.  The wait might be a bit long but it's worth every second. Don't expect overly friendly servers. They do their core function very well, so if you're the kind of person who needs food servers to fall all over you an attend to you like you're really something, then go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great brunch joint! Enjoyed the cafe across the street while we waited for our table. Food was delicious!! Slightly hipster for me though. Staff aren't dressed in a clean manner."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Went on a Monday morning, waitress was incredibly rude and sat us at a table where we did not want to sit, then continued to serve customers who came after us and then told us to go look at the specials, rather then tells us, when she finally got to our table. We sat there for 20 mins, before we finally got her attention to take our order. After all the terrible service and experience, we did not want to give our money to this place. We will never go there again.  I've been before in the past and had some few good experiences, but this was by far so disappointing, that I will never go back. 

Get some manners and treat paying customers with more respect."}
{"text":"Small, cozy breakfast nook with a brilliant rotating menu alongside old standbys. There is a wait - it's small and popular with the locals, but it is worth it. I have stood in the rain with friends, knowing what awaited me inside: carrot cake cookies one morning, call and eggs another, chorizo scrambled, there is always something warm and creative waiting for all tastes.  The service is slow. . . But that's what long cups of coffe with friends are for. 

Saving Grace is among the most original breakfast places that I have yet to find in Toronto."}
{"text":"Despite hearing about Saving Grace being very tiny, I was still shocked at how small the space was. I came on a weekday hoping to avoid the notoriously long wait but still waited half an hour for a table for 2. The place fits maybe 20 people max and the tables are only inches apart so you'll be getting cozy with your dining neighbors. 

The menu at Saving Grace consists of both breakfast and lunch items including a variety of egg dishes, French toast, sandwiches and salads. The chalkboard on the wall also lists the specials of the day. Looking at the menu and the daily specials, you'd notice they have a very eclectic menu, with some Asian and Indian-inspired items. 

What went in my belly:

Rajastani Eggs - scrambled with spicy red onion tomato, chickpea masala and a spicy paratha ($10): Big mistake. Way too spicy! One bite of the scramble and my mouth was on fire. None of the other components of the dish were particularly memorable. Chickpea masala was meh and the paratha was just too dry and crumbly for my liking.

Open Omelette - with caramelized pears, cambozola and bacon ($11): The omelette was well cooked and the classic combination of the pears, cheese and bacon was delicious! I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese so I'm glad the flavour of the cambozola was quite mild. The bitterness from the bit of arugula which topped the omelette was a welcome addition. Loved it all! 

Spicy Italian Sausage ($3) - added this to our meal since meat was really lacking...I'd skip this unless you're really craving meat. Nothing special.

French Toast - with caramelized bananas and maple syrup ($4.50 half order/$8.75 full order): I loved the choice of bread and liked that the bread was lightly washed with egg. Amazing. One of the best french toasts I've had!

Final thoughts? While I enjoyed the french toast and open omelette I'm not sure it would be worth a 1+ hour wait on the weekend..."}
{"text":"I hate waiting! I'd been to Saving Grace once before and had no wait. I got there at 10:30am on a recent Sunday (they open at 10am) and wasn't seated until 11:05am -- and I was a party of one!!  I came very close to leaving, but after 20 minutes, you figure you've gotta be close. They just are not worried about rushing in any way. I didn't leave Saving Grace until 12:05pm, meaning it took an hour for them to serve me eggs. 

The food is outstanding and which I give 5 stars -- but if you're planning to go on a weekend, prepare yourself for a long wait."}
{"text":"Small brunch spot with great food. Glad to have chosen to come here for brunch with a friend. Not suitable for big groups and the wait will be slow if you don't make it in the first rush of patrons. Service was slow and we waited a long time for the waitstaff to check on us. Once our bill came we waited again as we  didn't realize you need to go to the back if you want to pay with debit. This location doesn't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say...I've been here a couple of times and have yet to be disappointed. On my most recent adventure, I took a few newbies to this joint and they both had a great experience as well.

Yes, the wait times for brunch can be long but it is well worth it. You enter, sign up on the clipboard and eventually an employee calls you in so you can choose possibly one of the best brunches ever.

Seating space is limited inside and maximized (prepare to squeeze into a table) but that's what adds to the charm of this cute hipster-y place. It's warm and cozy while still having a great energy that only an independent restaurant could offer. It feels like you're visiting a second home. Blissful.

Although I was planning on ordering something different the second time around, I simply couldn't resist ordering the Angela sandwich once again. My mouth was watering just thinking about it at the table.  A perfect sandwich combination of avocado, bacon, arugula and tomato chutney with a side of greens and roasted potatoes. You simply can't go wrong. And the portions are hefty! Come on an empty stomach and prepare to be filled up. Plus they offer reasonable prices!

My friends ordered the brie and pear sandwich and one of the egg dishes which were both enjoyed. Next to our table, a massive plate of waffles was served and I decided from there on in that I would order them the next time around. They looked delectable! 

If you're not a fan of waiting out in the cold on a weekend then wait until the spring/summer to come here. In the meantime...prepare your tastebuds."}
{"text":"I was just recently at Saving Grace for lunch, and I enjoyed it. It's really tiny, it's really hot. But I find it cozy and cute, really bright and quirky, minimalistic. Bad things are the waiting time, because it's so tiny they can't serve that many people at a time. Also wait times for food are longer than expected (but I wouldn't go so far as saying theyre ridiculous). 

Today I ordered (off the chalkboard) the Enfrijoladas (oh god, I think that's the right word!). It was a Dish of mushy-ness! Tortilla, baked beans, cheese, avacado, and sour cream, Salad on the side. *If you don't like cilantro, ask them for it without. Its all over this dish, and not mentioned in the description so I was super disappointed. It was really good and filling. Maybe a little pricey, but I enjoyed it. 

My boyfriend got a hot sandwich with tapendae, avacado, tomato, arugula (I don't remember what else was on it) and it came also with a side salad. His was really small, for a guy, so I felt bad stuffing my face with Mexican mush while he had a quaint little sandwich and salad. This was $8.75 or something.

The service was friendly, not super present (had to stop a waitress for more water). But all in all a nice experience. I'd recommend it, but it wasn't anything too special. 

Some things to be wary of though: When you're checking in to wait for a table, there is a sign up sheet hung on the inside of the door, put your name on it! We didn't know this, so we waited around until another girl came after us, put her name down, then was seated before us. . :( Also, there will probably be a wait. So don't come super super hugnry. It's tiny, and you might have to sit at a bar \"table\" looking over the other tables next to other people. Not a bad thing, just something to note!

**Only accepts cash and interac"}
{"text":"If I could rate this restaurant 0 stars I would. Terrible experience. To wait for a table, they have people write their name on a list by the front door. This place usually has a number of people waiting outside. After writing our name on the list and waiting 30 minutes outside, we went to check on the list and found our name crossed off and written below another 10 tables. After bringing this up to the staff, there response was \"too bad\". I would never go here again and will be sure to tel everyone I know about this experience. This restaurant should be ashamed. Forget saving grace. This place is an absolute disgrace"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for so long, finally went there on a week day, no line up. The french toast was good, poached egg with salad was mediocre, the only waitress that's serving definitely not passionate about her job, no air conditioning on a hot day. Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"I agree - the food is great - but is it worth first a one hour wait outside (thank goodness it was a sunny day) and then an hour after we had ordered just to be served? Or was this just because they seemed to be serving the others around us first.......when we queried when our food was the waitress wasnt even apologetic

The avocado expresso is quite amazing and the brunch option defintely different and great prices"}
{"text":"Very nice brunch items -- not your typical brunch place, but they offer really nice and creative items. Their smoothies are pretty good too. The wait time can be long (~1 hr)."}
{"text":"Really lovely eggs benny--lemony and light as air. They also have fantastic juices and chutneys. It's a small place, so it's nice for two people but you'll have to wait longer for groups of 3 or more. Gets a bit warm in the summertime, so I prefer to go earlier in the morning. You may want to dress warm in winter, as the line can get quite long. The service is on the slower side, but I like that they manage to keep a chill, tranquil vibe despite being such a popular brunch spot."}
{"text":"Came for brunch recently on the recommendation of a friend and LOVED this place!  It has a really charming, rough-around-the-edges vibe, the food was delicious (with good sized portions), and it was reasonably priced.  I had the Angela sandwich--bacon, avocado, tomato chutney, cheddar and arugula on really good bread.  Delicious!  Came with a side of salad greens.  

I would give this place five stars, but service was incredibly slow.  It took probably forty or forty-five minutes to get our food after we ordered.  They warn you about this on the menu, and granted, it was crowded, but still: forty minutes to make a sandwich and an egg dish?  Why?  I'd probably go back, but I will plan accordingly so I'm not starving by the time the food comes.  I would say it's worth it assuming that you know to expect a long wait for the food."}
{"text":"Nice way to start our day. Fresh coffee, thick French toast. Although the service was a bit slow, it did allow us to relax and enjoy our morning."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast spot! Unfortunately, the wait is always long on weekends, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The best place to have breakfast. Despite the fact it's a small restaurant their food is delicious! I tried the indian style egg and regular pancake with dates. Oh! I would eat here every day!"}
{"text":"The only place I would queue for. Amazing brekkie. Best in Toronto.

Solid fare with a Latina twist. Very nice staff too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has rave reviews. I don't get it. The service is incredibly slow, the restaurant is VERY dirty and the food is only ok at best. It took them almost 15 minutes to take our order - so we almost left.  I had egg shells in my scrambled eggs and the toast was cold and damp from the butter. The salad was topped with hummus, but it wasn't great, it made the lettuce wet and heavy. The coffee however was THE BEST. So good! The best part of my meal by far."}
{"text":"I have to say...the service here is not great. But that's not why we came here. We came for the food, with low expectations for service.  Once you have eaten your meal, you will forget the horrible service because your belly will be soo happy.

Definitely get the two french toasts on the regular menu (the savoury which has brie and apples, and the sweet, which has carmelized bananas - this was my FAVE dish). I can't remember the names of the specials our group ordered but the mexican-ish one was a big hit and the one with cornmeal pancakes was also good.
Do avoid the old white cheddar sandwich (regular menu) - it sounds good but I think I expected the cheddar to be all melty and the sandwich to be warm. It was neither melty nor warm....

The wait was about 45 minutes around noon on Saturday. Even so, I'd come back and wait again...just for that french toast! I had to knock a star off for the service or it would have been a 5 star :)"}
{"text":"My most recent visit on a quiet Monday was pretty much a complete fail. Bad service and food. Two tables that came in after we ordered were served their food before us. (not the only time this has happened to me at Saving Grace) While we waited, other patrons went to the kitchen to complain. When the food finally came, my boyfriend eventually found  a long hair actually baked into his French toast. We had to wave our server over, as she didn't check in with us once during our meal.  Used to be a brunch staple for me, however each visit to Saving Grace lately seems unorganized."}
{"text":"Great food, bad service.

Saving Grace has to be my favorite brunch spot in Toronto, the food is on point every time. I usually order off the specials menu which changes daily. Frittata is always delicious, and the pancakes are so sweet and fluffy. 
The only bad thing I have to say about Saving Grace is that the service is weird. The wait staff aren't very friendly, and can sometimes be rude. One of my first couple times coming here a waitress told me that she didn't have time to read me the menu when I had asked her about a particular item on the Daily Specials menu. I understand that brunch service is busy, but I was shocked at how shamelessly rude she was. 

Tip, there is almost always a wait, so put your name down and head over to Ella's Uncle across the street and grab a coffee while you wait."}
{"text":"Great brunch, huge portions. Different ingredients but they all work together. For example, I had fried eggs on rye with Brie, jam and jalape√±o peppers. Get the smashed potatoes- so good!!"}
{"text":"Be sure to go on a Friday morning! Lol! I've heard people complain about the line-up but there is a reason - the FOOD IS DELICIOUS! We went for breakfast this morning - I had the french toast with caramelized bananas and REAL maple syrup while my hubby had the poached eggs with crumpet, bacon, chutney and greens. Conversation stopped when our food was served because it was delicious and we were savouring every bite. Great coffee too. Fantastic service, quick and super friendly. Love this little place, will go weekdays only though - fear of the weekend crowds :)"}
{"text":"Saving grace was a delicious morning treat. Their menu contains such a wide variety of options, one can't help but try their whole menu. Yes when you get there, you will find a huge lineup. With repeat customers willing to wait over 30mins. 

They definitely have a dedicated fan base established. But the place is small and could get really claustrophobic for some people. 

However believe me guys the wait is worth it and if you don't mind the crowd, the wait and the location then there is no reason why you would not enjoy the food here. 

Yeah yeah I understand it can get really annoying  after all the years when management hasn't really done much to enhance their service. But I spoke to their management and it seemed like they are really content with what they have. So yeah sorry guys it doesn't seem like they will be expanding anytime soon. 

This is what I usually get and what you'll see in the picture below:

1) open omelette: smoked salmon avocado pickled ginger green onion sesame pearo with arugala salad, New Zealand lamb sausage and toast 
2) baked eggs in the hole, French toast, ricotta and arugula salad 
3) French toast, caramelized bananas, maple syrup 
4) banana mango smoothie

Food 4.5/5
Service 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I've eaten here over 8 years, and for those first couple years I would have given it 5 stars. Over the course of those 8 years I have often had \"best spot for brunch\" conversations and put Saving Grace at the top of the list.

The food is very creative and delicious. 

But... on Sunday I had a trifecta of problems, and this two star review is about this particular experience:

-They missed my name on the list, seating others ahead of us.
-They refilled every cup of coffee around me, but not mine. 
-There was a long black curly hair on the plate under my food. 

Having moved to the east end it's been a couple years since I visited Saving Grace. On Sunday I took my fiancee there for our anniversary, as she had never been there. I was expecting this to be a typically pleasant brunch, but from the first step things went wrong.

We got there just after the first customers had all been seated, as in... the girl before me got the last table. That's fine... i'm used to the wait and it was a beautiful day. So we sat on the bench and watched the line start to fill out. A half hour later another couple were called to a table. I immediately spoke up saying \"Excuse me, sorry but I think you missed my name on the sheet\". The server checked, and sure enough the proof was there on paper. 

\"I'm really sorry. What do you want me to do? Do you want the table?\" Without missing a beat my fiancee and I simultaneously said \"yes\".

I'm curious why she asked us how we'd like her to fix her mistake. I'm an understanding guy... mistakes happen. And I'm sure I'm not the first person this has happened to. So why isn't the fix automatic? Why didn't she know exactly what to do???

Solution: Seat the right people. Offer all parties involved free coffee. Go out of your way to make the awkward situation comfortable for the customer. 

That's on them. It's not on me to be apologetic for wanting to be seated in the proper order. 

But the way the situation was handled I was made to feel awkward, like I had inconvenienced both the server and the other patrons by speaking up. And then I couldn't help feel that the coffee miss wasn't a mistake... and horrified by the thought that maybe the hair was intentional (I am 99% sure it was an innocent mistake... i really hope... gross). If not for the first mistake I probably wouldn't have thought anything of the hair. But I had to stop eating and asked for the bill, purposefully not mentioning the hair until after we got the bill so as not to have it seem like maybe I put the hair there to guilt them into a discount. 

We paid in full, tipped about 15%, and left promptly. 

Every weekend at home I go all out cooking breakfasts that are a shade or two below the quality of Saving Grace (minus the creativity). I love to cook, I don't terribly mind doing dishes, and I love saving money by eating at home. 

We go out for food for the experience. 

While their food typically is 5/5, unfortunately on Sunday Saving Grace failed that anniversary experience. I hope they understand that in the competitive climate of Toronto brunch spots the experience is as important as the food. If they put the same love into their customers as they do the food then they are back on top again."}
{"text":"I suspect that Saving Grace is one of those places where the overall quality of the experience is determined by how busy it is.

I've been there on a Saturday morning and a Thursday morning, and I can say without a doubt that the weekend experience was a nightmare compared to a weekday.  Seriously, I'll never understand why people would wait an hour or more just for brunch.  That being said, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend avoiding weekend visits unless you're part of the first 16 people to enter the door when they open, or if you're a masochist.

I can't speak for other reviewers, but my weekday experience was perfect.  The food arrived in a respectable time and was perfect.  My friend had the french toast with caramelized bananas and maple syrup.  I had one of the daily specials, which was pan-fried eggs bahn mi style with pickled carrots, daikon, bacon, sriracha and maple syrup on a bun.  The french toast was particularly impressive.  Instead of standard bread, they use a fresh french baguette, which was perfectly soft on the inside with a crisp crust, and had a delicious buttery flavour that complimented the caramelized bananas.  I know I'm gushing about the french toast, and haven't said much about the bahn mi eggs, but seriously, the french toast was REALLY REALLY good. (though a word of warning, if you not a fan of sweet, I recommend ordering it with maple syrup ONLY on the side)

On a surprising note, they've also got a great selection of fresh juices.  I had the pear-ginger juice, and it was absolutely refreshing.  Their avocado-espresso is next on my list to order.

Overall, based on my two experiences, Saving Grace has good food and good service BUT ONLY when they're not getting slammed by cranky customers who have tortured themselves by waiting a ridiculous amount of time."}
{"text":"Saving Grace has always been busy every time I go by especially on the weekends, so the place must be that good if it's always busy.  Mind you, the place is small and seating is probably limited to about 20 people.
I finally managed to go with my BFF for brunch at 11:30am on Monday morning  which I thought would be okay on a weekday, but it was already packed. Guess we should have came before 11am. Luckily for us we didn't wait long as there was a table for two available that a group of three in front of us passed along to us.  Thank you kind strangers.

Menus were already on the table, plus the brunch menu was written on the chalkboard, so we were able to peruse and be ready to order when our server arrived.   It was at least five minutes before a server came by and plopped down a bottle of water for the table, then went away, then returned and plopped down two glasses without an exchange of any words. A simple hi/hello would suffice at this point since we weren't even acknowledged or greeted when we arrived since we sat ourselves.

It was close to another ten minutes before the server came back to take our orders.  She didn't smile and didn't introduce herself, but was ready to take our orders with pen and pad in hand.  It was definitely not a pleasant interaction and I thought fast food service was bad.  

I was famished and knew what I wanted, I ordered the baked eggs 'florentine' on oven baked french toast with spinach, provolone and parmesan ($11.75), plus blueberry lemonade ($3.75). My BFF had a hard time since the brunch menu on the chalkboard didn't appeal to her, so she ordered a simple breakfast of two eggs, plus sausages which included toast and salad ($8.50).  She also ordered the Espressado shake ($5) which I thought was a weird mix of espresso coffee and avocado.  I love avocado, but am not a fan of coffee, so I cannot imagine the pairing of the two.

Despite the lack of service (I believe there were two servers in total), our drinks arrived at a reasonable time.  My blueberry lemonade was refreshing and tasty that it quenched my thirst immediately.  My BFF's espressado was okay according to her and nothing to rave about.  I now wished I had tried some to see what the hype was as she read the reviews saying it was amazing.  

It seemed the food took an extra long time, so when it finally arrived I was  just happy with my order as it was simply presented and it just looks like cheesy goodness on top of french toast.  The first bite was heavenly in my mouth as all the flavours blended well together and tasted fresh especially the salad which was served in a light vinaigrette dressing.  I guess the food is truly the saving grace for this place since the service was horrible.

Somehow my BFF ended up with her order and someone else's order.  The server plopped the two plates in front of my BFF and left before she could say anything.  I wished I took a photo of the extra plate as it looked good despite not knowing what the extra dish was.  My BFF and I were still puzzled with the third plate, but thankfully the server returned a few minutes later realizing her mistake and took the extra plate away.  No apologies whatsoever, but at least there was something that resembled a slight smile on her face.

During our meal, no one came over to ask us how our food was or if we needed anything else.  The next interaction we had with the server(s) was when the check arrived on our table, still without any words spoken.  Thankfully, we were done our meal and were ready to leave.  The empty plates were cleared, we finished our drinks, paid and were on our way and still no word from the servers.   I felt like I was at Signs Restaurant, but without the usage of sign language. Good thing we both had cash and although service was awful we still gave a decent tip.

I'm hesitant if I will return, but definitely will not wait in line as there are many other brunch places with better service in the area."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from two friends both raved about how good it is but how bad the lineup is!  So we went over the holidays on a weekday to skip the lineup, but I guess everyone else had the same plan!!  We signed up on a board and probably waited 20 min to get our table.  

I absolutely love how small and cozy the place is and the big black chalkboard where the specials are written.  I chose their waffle of the day (came with butter shaped as a heart), a side of their lamb sausage and tried an espressado - essentially a vietnamese coffee with avocado instead of condensed milk, not sure I'm a fan but it is comforting that my fat was \"good\" instead of sugar/milk in a can.

The service was awesome and even though they were busy, we got all our food quickly - I had a taste of the brie/pear baguette and the benedict of the day both were also delicious.

I'd go back to Saving Grace if there wasn't such a big line up!  It's definitely a cute little place that cares about fresh stuff and giving every dish a little bit of an Indian or Middle East or Viet twist."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. I was not impressed by this hipster joint. I ordered coffee for 2.75$ and got one tiny cup and no offers of any more. I ordered bahn mi eggs. It was a dried out english muffin with over-poached eggs and some shredded carrots. Most of the plate was a salad. So unimpressed. And the meal cost 17.50, so not a cheap brunch, especially considering the complete mediocrity of the meal. Boooooo, worst."}
{"text":"Delicious food, bad service. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the food at Saving Grace. We ordered off the specials menu, and everything was simply delicious. I really enjoyed how their menu had so much selection, with the majority of options being unique in some way. Also, the price of everything on their menu right down to the drinks and smoothies was very reasonable and affordable. 

So other than the food my only comment is that the service was strange. Going to from happy to rude in a matter of seconds. It really did seem like the staff wished you weren't there. Ultimately, I would recommend this as a brunch spot food wise, but just be cautioned that you won't be treated well and since the establishment is extremely small you might get crammed into a small table/seat, and will be waiting outside until a spot opens up. So if you don't have the patience to deal with indifferent and rude staff I'd pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Dined at Saving Grace with a friend, on a Friday at 11am. I had an americano with the rajastani eggs - good coffee, the eggs were spicy and filling - healthy, I think we can assume?

My friend got a latte and the french toast - she loved both. 

Saving Grace is cozy, with friendly and efficient staff. The food is great - I can't wait to return and try more. Bear in mind, the space is on the smaller side so it gets busy, fast."}
{"text":"As a brunch affecionado, I thought I'd seen it, tried it, and had it all until I stepped into Saving Grace. Be warned: the lineup to get in is long. Be assured: Through rain, snow, and drizzle, it'll be worth it.

The place is small, but oddly airy, and the servers never make you feel rushed. The atmosphere is also wonderful - lively and always bustling, but never too loud to disrupt a conversation or make you have to raise your voice. Oh, but the food. The food alone is worth salivating over - always packed with flavour, incredibly adventurous, and made with so much care, the ultimate comfort food. It's just one of those places you can go to with friends, with family, with a loved one, for your bridal shower...(whoops, was I dreaming outloud there?!) Regardless, if you haven't been to this place, GO. It is by far my favourite brunch place in Toronto (dare I say the world?) and puts all others to shame. 

For the savourity tooth, try:
Their frittatas (my absolute favourite dish there by far!) Packed with so much flavour, and comes with the best dressed salad ever.

For the sweet tooth, try:
Their blueberry waffles and pancakes


For the daring and adventurous, try
Their Vietnamese coffee


Tip: Get there well before 10 a.m. if you want to reduce the lineup time!"}
{"text":"Her chippy attitude won't save Grace! 

We arrived right at 9am in the hope of starting a new tradition for our twice weekly breakfast outing. We waited outside the empty restaurant while 'Grace' and her buddies were laughing it up having their picture taken on the front step. No eye contact, no \"thanks for waiting, we'll be right with you\", no \"Hey, can we get you a coffee while we finish up this photo shoot\". Nothing. Ten minutes later, I politely asked if they were going to be opening soon. \"We'll open when we're finished taking pictures\", came Grace's surly reply. 

How appropriate that the photos show an empty restaurant in the background. Don't let the lineups go to your head, Grace, repeat customers are looking for a little, well, grace with their meal."}
{"text":"The Sunday Brunch at Saving Grace is worth the walk and the wait.  (Which is not as bad as some are making it out to be.)

I had the savory French toast, and can recommend it highly, but I get the feeling that the menu is solid up and down."}
{"text":"The service sucks!!!! We were told we were three people and can not use a big table because this is for 4. so upset"}
{"text":"Outstanding food at great prices and great atmosphere.  Had the poached eggs on poy lentils which comes with salad and lightly buttered Italian-bread toast.  I marvelled at how every part of the dish was so incredibly savoury but they combined in perfect melody.  Even the coffee was amazing. 
Don't be intimidated by the lineup either.  Get your name on the list and have a coffee right across the street while waiting.
I really need to eat there more often !  
Rick"}
{"text":"A cosy and affordable brunch spot. 

Pros: I love the range of cleverly named and truly original brunch options. The food was nothing short of excellent. Our server was kind and attentive. 

Cons: We were here on a very cold day but it seemed like the heating was really struggling to keep up.
No reservations (though not a-typical for brunch).

The bottom line: Worth a go. The french toast was enjoyed by all. I really enjoyed 'eggs in the hole'."}
{"text":"I have been to Saving Grace a few times and it has always been a positive experience. yes there is some wait however it is well worth it. The French toast is to die for plus they have a lot of creative menu items to choose from.
If you re looking for a different brunch place with great service this is the place for u."}
{"text":"Only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the iffy service. Sometimes the waitress is really nice and welcoming, and sometimes, perhaps because it is a very small restaurant yet extremely busy, they are dismissive and not very friendly. 
Their regular menu is great and always delicious. I love that their dishes are all homey items, but with a healthy twist. They also have daily choices and they all always sound great, which makes it really hard to pick something!  Overall, the aesthetics of the restaurant compliment the great selection. recommend it"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we must've picked the WRONG day. We put our names on the list but other people (friends of those who work there?) seemed to get called first. When we were ordering, we were notified that there were no potatoes because the oven was broken. No sausages, either. Oh, and they ran out of bacon. And the espresso machine was on the fritz so no hot water for tea. It's a good thing the French toast was damn delicious."}
{"text":"Very good address for brunch or lunch. The food is great and there is always something new to try. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"I had the Dahl with roti for breakfast. It was watery and lacking in flavour. It was a special, so perhaps their regular menu is more in line with the reviews here. Aside from that the staff were unfriendly and made us wait an additional 20 minutes beyond their advertised opening time with no explanation as to why."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a very very very cold Saturday morning. Thankfully there were only two couples ahead of us and we were able to wait inside. The place is small,  but turnover is relatively efficient.

We were seated in the front corner window seat. It was a bit cool, but I didn't need to keep my coat on or anything. Anyway, they provide scarves at each table, presumably in case people get a bit chilly.

There's a regular menu and an extensive list  of chalkboard specials. We ordered the eggs rajasthani from the regular menu, a scrambled eggs special, and a half order of pancakes (listed on the regular menu but the flavour is described in the chalkboard.) Everything was good to excellent.

Although the place is small, it's busy. There were two servers working and they were HUSTLING. Even so, service was friendly and we didn't feel rushed.

All in all, a great place for a great brunch."}
{"text":"As soon as you enter the restaurant, you get a genuinely warm and friendly feeling from the owner and staff. To add to this, is a creative and delicious menu which offers a mixture of Mexican to Indian inspired breakfast/brunch dishes and drinks.

This place is usually packed but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"You want to like this place, but the service is so bad. The wait is super long, but once you start  waiting it seems like a waste to give up.

There are better places in the city."}
{"text":"A lot of fans in this small brunch place. Please expect the waiting of the drink, the food and the lineup on the weekend. I saw people waiting outside in the snow in winter. The food is good. Huge portion. The menu is quiet unique. I like the part that you gotta order half an order of waffle, French toast or pancakes as a dessert. They have a lot of options of drinks as well. I tried avocado espresso smoothie. It's strong and rich. A bit too sweet to my taste. I should've asked half sweet when I ordered it. In general, it's a good brunch little place."}
{"text":"You won't have to wait in line on Monday at 9:30 am. My friends and I pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. Eventually, there were another few tables occupied, but the service remained attentive.

2 friends had the rajasthani eggs and enjoyed them a great deal. One advised that they were spicy enough to be a bit too much for some people. 

Two of us had the French toast...my friend the savory and me the sweet. Both delicious and plentiful.  The coffee was excellent and free flowing.

Definitely a garage-sale vibe here, with mismatched plates and funky decor which I enjoyed. The plywood tables and bench seating, however, was a little off-putting (and uncomfortable). Replace these with funky kitchen tables and chairs, and earn your 5th star."}
{"text":"I love the concept of a brunch menu changing every two weeks and keeping a standard menu for brunch. It keeps the brunch game exciting and ~fresh~. Make sure to go right when it opens since the lines get long super quickly. It's a super small restaurant so don't expect your giant group to get in, preferably 2 people with a maximum of 4. I got their BLT which was super tasty. It really hit the spot and their bacon is sooooo good. My sister and I got a half order (they do half offers which is fantastic since it fulfills your craving of something sweet when you order something savoury) of their nutella pancakes. They were little balls of pancake dough with nutella inside. They were super tasty especially with the maple syrup. I wouldn't recommend ordering their nutella pancakes by itself since it's not super filling."}
{"text":"Came by Saturday for brunch with a group of 5. Be sure to arrive early or you'll end up waiting for a table - this place is TINY.

Ordered a scrambled egg tostada with salsa and avocado ($12) and a cup of americano ($3). My friends got a variety of other dishes, french toast, fritatas, etc. I honestly think their food is \"whatever\". Nothing special or to coo about. We also waited 30-45 mins for our food even though we got a table right when they opened and ordered pretty much right away. It was annoying because we ended up being there from 10am to 12:30pm AND they had no AC. No apologies for making us wait so long whatsoever. I know they probably wanted to get the smaller order out of the way but the table that sat down next to us ordered, got their food, left and another table sat down even got their food before us. Definitely unacceptable!

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service and wait time. This is not a group friendly place. We were a party of 7 and had to wait for over an hour for a table and we eventually got one, our server was not very helpful; she'd rather refer us to the chalk board downstairs than tell us what the daily specials were, forgot milk and cream for our coffee, didn't remember who'd ordered what, was hard to get hold of and in the end handed me the bill to figure out how it had to be split, which I didn't appreciate at all. We wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"It gets extremely crowded on the weekends, so it's best to go on a weekday (Thu, Fri, or Mon) if you can.  Every time we've come on a weekend it's been long lines out the door - which is okay, because Black Hoof cafe (our favorite brunch place) is next door - but even when we tried to go in to Saving Grace, they pretty much ignored us and we ended up leaving.  However, when we came on a weekday they were really nice, and the food was among the more interesting and creative that we've had for brunch in the city, including things like a breakfast sandwich with plantain, and an avocado coffee shake (which I wouldn't order again, but it is definitely creative and I give them props for that...)."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches I had in Toronto.  We came on a weekday, and quickly noticed that there was a lengthy waitlist.  While a little disappointed, we decided to stick around.  Turns out, they were able to get us seated within ten minutes! 

The food is made to order, so prepare for a wait.  Certainly worth the wait though! I ordered the rajasthani eggs, and the plum almond pancakes with the citrus syrup.  

The rajasthani eggs were DIVINE.  The key, in my opinion is to mix everything together and eat it with the paratha, dipping it in yogurt.  Ultimate comfort food.  

The pancakes were such a vibrant burst of flavor! The pancake batter was very mild, but the plums brought in such a lovely sweetness, especially paired with the syrup.  The almonds gave it a little bit of an earthy taste, with an added crunch factor.  

Seriously cannot say enough about this place.  Honestly worth the wait, worth the out of the way trek."}
{"text":"Petite eatery near trinity Bellwood with cute decor and chalkboard menu. The faded blue walls and wooden tables will prompt you for a fresh and healthy breakfast experience on floral China plate and cup sets. They have a Victorian era theme going on distantly. The menu is an appropriated variety of food brought inspired from colonized lands (India, Middle East, South America). They have parathas and Rajasthani scrambled egg with chick pea salad. You can tell it's my authentic but you wouldn't come here for an authentic experience; its a good place for a white hipster mood and that's always a good brunch experience for me (albeit the political implications)

I had the poached eggs on salad greens with middle eastern potato pancakes (kind of like potato hash brown pakora) and homemade sour cream. You can add lamb or sausage for an extra dollar. The food tasted amazing. One of the egg yolk got too hard but the other one was perfectly poached, the yellowy delight oozed out smoothly the moment I cut through the thin white membrane. The eggs were a perfect compliment with the leafy greens and the potato pancakes. The sour cream stole the show: creamy, not too sour, maybe even a bit sweet, had onions in them. Really just great!

I had coffee as well and even though it looks dark, don't make the mistake of adding too much milk haha

I'll definitely come back to saving grace for a light happy breakfast experience."}
{"text":"My opinion of this place is affected by the line-up, if you could walk in and get a table without a wait then I'd probably give it 3 stars. Unfortunately the strange popularity (not the restaurants fault) resulted in a prolonged brunch experience which included decent but not great food."}
{"text":"Went to brunch here on Saturday with a friend, it was about a 30 minute wait time~ 10:30 arrival and seated by 11:00. You need to sign your name on a chart hanging on the inside of the restaurant beside the door, then they call you based on where you are on the list. The board specials are all very good, and the caramelized banana French toast is a must!!! The food is definitely worth the wait~"}
{"text":"Good food does indeed take time to cook.

I went on a sunday and the line appeared long but trust me folks, hang around cause 1. Its worth it and 2. the line dwindles fast since some ppl end up leaving.

Menu is small but they do it all well. Parking directly outside was a bonus for me. 

I ordered the french toast with bananas, channa indian paratha, and another dish I can't remember what it was but it has an egg, greens and rice (see pic). EVERYTHING was just perfect and yes I ate all 3. 

My waitress Michelle (super friendly pretty lady - Hi Michelle!!!) was in disbelief that I polished off all 3 dishes. My friend got the waffles. 

I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I am honestly not sure what they are going for with this restaurant, because making money is certainly not its priority! I would give this a 2.5 rating if I could.

I knew that we would be waiting a while, but it was really, really frustrating to watch the servers let people linger for 45 minutes (I counted) after their meal was finished, drinking coffee while they chatted. (It didn't help that it was raining when I went.) I also don't appreciate being admonished on the menu even before the meal starts: \"please be polite to staff\" is right there on the bottom. I can see why this could happen when hungry people watch others take up tables while checking out their phones!

But onto the food. Yes, it's good, but honestly, not so good that I would endure that wait anytime again in the near future. I had the burrito roll-up which had a nice avocado creme on top. The one thing that would draw me back is their amazing avocado espresso shake. It sounds odd, but it's amazing.

While we were eating we saw two couples turned away -- it was around 2:15, and their sign says they are open till 3:00. Just a warning in case you are looking for a really late brunch."}

Michael G¬†(0 review)

This place is awful! Seriously the worst experience ever. And this is the FOURTH time I have given it a chance. Every time the food arrives it's 30 minutes plus. You are totally ignored all the time, and the servers look at you like you are pond scum.

Today I was the second person in the restaurant right as the doors opened.

I waited for my guest for 15 minutes and ordered within 5 minutes of her arrival. 40 minutes passed as a 6 top that arrived 20 minutes after me got their food. I complained and looked around as 5 other guests who also arrived after me were finished their meals and trying to pay their bills.

I didn't even get a damned apology. These clowns give the restaurant industry a bad name.

This is the first review I have ever written. I manage a restaurant. Get
it together people. Your guests deserve better treatment. Imagine how much more business you would have if you could serve people in a timely manner. 1hour and 20minute turns on a breakfast table? What a joke.

And take potatoes of your menu. You look like idiots. You never allow people to order them, because for some reason you can't figure out how to cook them. I will never go back. And I will tell every single person I encounter in life to avoid your terrible restaurant. Good riddance."}
{"text":"The worst ever. Bad customer service . Nad explanation of the menu . No variety . No customization of the orders whatsoever."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times before, always enjoyed the food. The last time was very dissapointing with regards to service and food. It took close to an hour to receive our food after ordering. We felt ignored and avoided while we were waiting. We assume they forgot to put our order in as newcomers began receiving food after 20 minute waits. My meal was a stripped omlette on undercooked rice noodles, which was very ubderwhelming, however it was the service that was the real dissapointment from the experience.
Along with my meal I orderd a side of smashed potatoes which we asked for a second time and never came. Rather than explain she forgot them- which I completely understand as a server myself-the potatoes were voided from my bill without any acknowledgement about the incident or bother to see if I still wanted them.
Unfortunately that will be the last time I visit saving grace as there are many other great brunch places in Toronto that will offer the steps of service I feel happy paying for.

{"text":"No flares just a simple brunch spot with good food.  Be careful though is a first come first serve.  Lines can get long on the weekend.  I usually add my name to the list and go across the street to Ella's uncle and get a coffee and read the paper while I wait.  The French toast is great and so are their daily specials.  My go to meal is the Brie and pear on a baguette."}
{"text":"This place is tiny, there will be a wait to get but man, is the wait worth it! 

They have avocado coffee (esspressado), which was very creamy and slightly too bitter for me. But if you love espressos, you'll probably like the esspressado. 

I also got their lavender waffles. The flavours all mixed so well. Definitely most unique and delicious tasting waffles I've had. 

Sadly it's a little far for me to get here, but defiantly worth the travel."}
{"text":"It wasn't that the food was awful, the food was fine, not memorable but fine. It was so loud that I could barely hear the people that were sitting right across from me and you had to yell to talk (I'm not joking). We actually didn't experience a wait but maybe that's because we came on a weekday, but it was still packed. 

I think that seeing pictures of this place and reading amazing reviews really made me believe that this was going to be a great place to have brunch... but the decor was merely average, food was fine, noise level was ridiculous, our waitress didn't say a word to us other than \"what's your order\". Considering how many amazing places there are in the city with great staff, decor, and food this place is somewhere I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I agree with others when they say this place has the worst service and some of the rudest wait staff they have encountered. I had the unpleasant experience of dealing with THE rudest waitress I have ever met in my entire life here. I ended up walking out. It's not THAT delicious for me to deal with rudeness and complete lack of basic manners while paying for it. 
Never go there."}
{"text":"A brunch place that is not open on Sunday? I don't understand that - it's the most popular bunch day?!"}
{"text":"Ok for a weekday lunch, but I can't imagine lining up for this on the weekend. Space is small and like other small brunch places, to keep it seemingly \"hard to get into\", service is painfully slow.  

Server was nice but uninformed - I asked if the cheese on the sandwich was melted and she said no, \"it's just lying on there\", but it was indeed melted. Sandwich was wacky - raisin bread w savoury ingredients. Well priced and lots of options, so I would go back if someone asked. Tons and tons of fruit flies everywhere - they should get that fixed."}
{"text":"We quickly learned that brunch time is serious business in Toronto and that waiting in line was to be expected. We were up for the challenge and Saving Grace truly saved our hungry stomachs. Although it was a little crammed and incredibly warm inside (no AC), it was still a very cute restaurant with a lot of charm. I opted for their caramelized banana French toast and it was oh so very good. Definitely bring your sweet tooth ready for that one, though! They offered several savory options as well that all looked delicious. Would definitely recommend this spot if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Saving Grace is a tiny cafe with a long wait for a creative and filling brunch.

I went to Toronto for a weekend to visit friends and found this small brunch spot. Reminds me of Lula Cafe in Chicago. The lattes have so much foam on top that it looks like an ice cream sundae.

I'm vegan, so there wasn't much of a selection for me, but the Lebanese \"pizza\" was delicious and had a creative use of pomegranate seeds.

Most of the dishes were \"eggy\" and cheesy, but were complemented by plenty of fresh veggies."}
{"text":"The place is super cute and maybe I just had an off experience but it's not somewhere I'll likely go back to. I think maybe it just wasn't for me because it is so popular, the wait is quite long and people are willing to wait for it.
Summer brunch was not comfortable in the little place, it was just way too hot and humid; we couldn't enjoy our food because we were so uncomfortable.
The food was just too heavy, everything had too much of something. I had the frittata and there was just too much cheese, it was more of a scramble. I also found everything was just heavy in general.
Price was good, atmosphere was simple and cute; just not the most comfortable.
I will say that for how long the wait was, we were never rushed out or felt pressured to leave once we were finished and that is really appreciated!"}
{"text":"Wow. 
I had the BEST.Pancakes.I've.Ever.Tasted. 
Ever. 

These pancakes were like nothing I've ever come across. 
They weren't even very much like pancakes at all...i can't really describe the texture, but they were amazing. 

The Pear Pancakes were the special for the day (on the board). 
It was somewhat fluffy but also dense on the inside and crisped on the outside. The pear was poached and caramelized and a huge slice of it was inserted right in the middle of each pancake. It tasted almost like a pancakey-pastry? That's the closest description i can offer. 
There were 3 pancakes and i couldn't even finish them (shocking since i'm pretty much a trash can); had to pack one to go. 

I also got the vietnamese iced coffee and breakfast sausages and they were good...but the pancakes were the highlight. 

Service was good; my food came out really quickly, but the servers seemed really busy...service wasn't the fastest in terms of taking orders and getting the check, but my server was friendly

I can imagine that the wait would be ridic and ppl would be annoyed on the weekends...but i had the day off on Friday and only waited 5 mins during lunchtime. 

*perfect*. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The restaurant management has serious problems. We overheard that 2 ppl sat down on a reserved table, which does not have a reservation plate on it. And no one stopped them at the sight. After a while, a waitress told them that the table is reserved and asked them to leave. Like everyone else, those 2 ppl actually spent a long time waiting in line in this cold morning. It's not fair to ask customers to leave when it's the restaurant's problem. The chef made a huge scene out of it. Its ridiculous."}
{"text":"Toronto's hidden gem.

Very hard to get a spot...they don't take reservations and is a more of a first come first serve situation. They have a clipboard upfront where you can write your name (BE SURE TO SIGN IN!). There are no hostesses as it is a very small establishment. Every time you go be sure to go in with an open mind! Each menu is in correspondence with the season and what is basically good right now in the markets. Last time I went for brunch I got the banana french toast which I always get as it is super savory, creamy and rich in flavor."}
{"text":"The food is definitely 5 stars for sure.  We came on a week day during the holidays and were seated within about 15 minutes of getting there.  Pretty good compared to the wait some Yelpers have faced.  

The food is amazing.  I had date and oatmeal pancakes with caramelized bananas and it was so good.  The problem with this place is the service just sucks.  It took 20 minutes for us to be first approached after being seated.  It took us almost 2 hours to complete our afternoon date.  Quite frankly, we often felt forgotten.

As much as I loved the food and was really impressed by it I doubt I will be returning any time soon.  I think that good service is really important when you are at a restaurant.  I feel like in Toronto there are many great places to eat but the bad service ruins it all."}
{"text":"WORST BRUNCH EXPERIENCE EVER. We waited for two hours only so they could tell us they ran out of food an hour ago. A 10-15 minute wait became another hour. No compensation for the utter waste of time besides \"sorry\". Terribly slow service as tables were empty with at least 10-15 people waiting to be seated. Do not come here if you want a relaxing brunch with good food be food service. Whatever the food quality is will be ruined by the stressful experience. Don't waste your time. I will NEVER come back."}
{"text":"Went to the place for the first time, and it was great.  Other people complain about the wait time, but I went during the week and it was pretty empty.  I had eggs Benedict that were awesome, and my friends had banana French toast that was equally as good.  Decor was cute, without being overly hipster cutesy.  I definitely would go again if I'm in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip.  Great for a local brunch spot though!"}
{"text":"Years ago I had a rigid brunch tradition--Sunday mornings were almost always spent at the venerable Verveine in Leslieville. My friends would all congregate at one of their large tables and drink copious amounts of coffee and indulge in more scones than any regular-sized person should ever encounter. We came to really cherish this restaurant and our time there. Then--in a dramatic twist--Verveine closed its doors and we were left to wander the wilderness of brunchland in Toronto. (Don't get me wrong, we ate at a plethora of other brunch spots during those V-years, just not as frequently.)

The only other brunch spot that has become a tradition in my life is Saving Grace. But this recognition hasn't come without some blood sweat and tears. When I started frequenting SG, one thing was clear: amazing food/terrible service. It's not like I expect good service anywhere in Toronto, especially at brunch, but SG's service had an almost mockingly bad air about it. But the food was SO GOOD I found myself doing anything it would take to be liked by the snarly servers. I'd giggle if they glared at me, excitedly overtalk and over-engage if they happened to say one word to me, and then over tip, hoping it would melt their over-poached hearts. It worked to some degree.

Years have passed since those early days. Their food is still indescribably good, but their service has improved tenfold. I absolutely LOVE their regular team now. I still giggle lots and over-tip/over-engage, but now I do it for different reasons. Something about good food makes me slightly crazy.

Tips: try to get there right when it opens (which I think is 10 AM on the weekend), otherwise the lineups get a bit irritating
-the clientele can be among the most irritating on earth (ei. when I was there this weekend, one unruly cavewoman-like child terrorized the patrons as her parents beamed with pride--so swallow your own pride and just try to enjoy the food
-I humbly recommend the french toast and/or the Brazilian Eggs (when it's on the menu)--these are my favorites; however you can't go wrong with ANYthing"}
{"text":"Solid choice for brunch on a weekday.  Daily specials are great, and service was friendly.  Wouldn't wanna wait more than 20 mins for this one though so I'd avoid it on weekends."}
{"text":"Long wait for a very disappointing brunch.  Sure it's all hipstery with hand me down furniture, crazy hairdo'd waiters and they write on chalkboards like all the other cool kids but, this was was a joke.

Had the frittata and it was 70% uncooked broccoli.  Decent coffee.

Don't remember what my gf got, but it doesn't matter. She didn't bother finishing and we went somewhere else instead.

There's so many better places just down the street."}
{"text":"My favourite neighbourhood brunch spot! Cheap and delicious to!!

They always have a chalk board of specials for that day that always look delicious. Their usual menu is great to! 

We always order the poached eggs with toast and salad, the Brie and pear on toast, the caramalized banana French toast !

My top favourite drinks are the apple cider and the Vietnamese ice coffee!!!

If you come in and the have coconut lemon poppyseed pancakes on their specials menu ORDER THEM!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this quaint little joint and the breakfast was perfect to start the day, not too heavy nor light.  They make their dishes unique but don't venture too far off.  The place was a tight squeeze but all the customers seemed to enjoy their breakfast as well."}
{"text":"Came in here for a late lunch, which in hindsight seems like a good idea as it was almost empty and we didn't have to deal with crowds which seems to plague this location with their very limited seating. 

It reminds me of Cafe La Gaffe from Baldwin Street in regards to the food but at a better price. That was very key for me since their menu sounds amazing especially when you combine their specials list. I got myself a tapenade panini which came with a healthy serving of salad. Very tasty and completely worth every cent. 

I ordered a latte and I am sorry to say that it wasn't all that great  and for a brunch location to be exceptional they should have their coffee drinks completely down. 

I do love their tiny location, while it is probably a hindrance during peak hours it is charming when you have it all to yourself. Service was good, the waiter kept filling my friend's coffee frequently which is always a good thing.

I highly recommend Saving Grace and I can't wait to visit it again to try out more from their menu but maybe try out another location if you want your coffee fix post meal."}
{"text":"I hate lineups; and lineups and brunch seem to go hand-in-hand as if it were part of the overall brunch \"experience.\"  And not only that, the good brunch places will ensure an even longer lineup.

Saving Grace has always been on my list of places to try for brunch but the waiting part has always put me off since I normally only brunch on weekends which = lineups.  But since they are open 7 days a week for brunch, I went on a weekday and there was no line :)

Pastel colored paints of green and pink make this place seem like the kind where valet stroller parking is to be expected outside.  The overall feel of the restaurant is homey and cozy, as if you were over at a friend's house while enjoying conversation through the kitchen serving window while brunch is being made.  The space is quite small (probably seating no more than 25) and there's no wonder there are lineups given the pace of service (even on a Wednesday).  I'd hate to think how busy they get on weekends.  There's a clipboard at the entrance to put down your name and number for them to call you when your table's ready.

Daily specials are scribbled on the chalkboard in addition to their regular menu.  What intrigued me about Saving Grace is the fact that their menu isn't boring.  While brunch is mostly all about eggs they have a few unique twists on brunch such as the Rajastani Eggs ($10) scrambled with spicy red onion and tomato served with a healthy serving of Masala chickpeas and spicy paratha - a nice departure from your usual eggs and toast.  I found the dish overall needed some more salt and the paratha was too floury and rather bland.  The eggs were cooked just right.

We also opt for a side order of potatoes (when available) and today it's in the form of a hash ($2.50).  Again, a little scant on the seasoning, but the chutney on top is the saving grace with it's sweet and spicy flavor.

Brunch ends on a sweet note with a half order of the French Toast ($5.25) with caramelized bananas and maple syrup.  Eggy slices of bread that really don't need the extra syrup though I suggest dunking the crust into it and enjoying irresponsibly.   The caramelized bananas are perfect and if there's one dish that knocks it out of the park - this is it.  My first dish comes out with a hair in it, but is replaced with a brand new one.

Between the regular menu and the bounty of specials scribbled on the chalkboard, there are no shortage of options. And waiting for brunch in this neighborhood isn't so bad since you can grab a kick ass coffee at Ezra's Pound a few doors down.  Even if you don't finish it in time before you get called, it's only a $0.50 surcharge to bring in outside drinks.  I would say that Saving Grace is a decent brunch spot and their caramelized banana French toast is definitely worth lining up for; but other than that it wasn't anything extraordinary.

*NOTE* Cash or Interac only."}
{"text":"This place is insanely busy and as tiny as a shoebox. But it's always busy. The menu is limited, but they whip up this avocado milkshake here that is incredible. I would go back just for the shake. The food was pretty good, but the shake was clearly the star for me =D"}
{"text":"Came for brunch... Food was delicious! Very satisfying and different. Service was a bit slow and servers clothes dirty with food (bit of a turn-off). But I would still recommend based on the food."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait .. waited one hour - people who came after us got served much faster - it was like they forgot about us. 
The food looked like it would be good however when we got our meals it was poor presentation and my eggs looked sloppy and as if they were just thrown together in a rush. 
Service was bad. 
Really disappointed as I expected better. 
Three stars for taste."}
{"text":"Went for brunch this morning with two friends. It's a small place so the 3 of us had to share a table for 2, but we didn't mind. The food was unreal and everything sounded and looked so good that we had a lot of trouble deciding what to order. We all ordered from the specials board. I had the earl grey french toast and my friends had the churro waffles and we were all very pleased with our choices. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food at this brunch spot was tasty and fresh. I had fried eggs with andouille sausages, leek and other vegetables, with a side order of 1/2 french toast to share. The french toast was incredibly delicious and the fried egg meal was fresh and light. I also got a mochaccino which wasn't that chocolatey but was ok.

However I had to take off a couple of stars because the wait was absolutely ridiculous (2 hours) and the service was not that great. The waiter didn't seem like he even wanted to be there - he seemed annoyed by his job. 

I would maybe go back on a day off but never on a weekend because I don't have that kind of time to stand around and wait outside for my name to be called. I would recommend that they take reservations or let people sign up and leave their phone number so at least they could get things done while waiting."}
{"text":"Delicious! Brunch is so so good. There is always a wait though, so be prepared to hang for a little bit. The vibe is super cozy, and again, the food is amazing. Definitely worth the wait & even the heat, it's a lil toasty inside on a warm day, but the food will make up for that fact :)"}
{"text":"when i arrived there was a bit of a wait and its monday so i knew this place must be poppin. My friend and i both ordered from their specials. I got the crumpet earl grey french toast which was good i just would have liked something to go along with it. She got the spinach toast with egg and parmeson it came with potatoes and a small side salad. The taste of everything was great, i would definitely go back and wait in line again."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my bf's friends because it was someone's birthday. They started lining up at 9:30 and the line was huge. Luckily, we were first and got seated at the giant table at the back for our big party. 

This is a cute, little, trendy brunch place for young people. I'm pretty sure everyone in the restaurant was under 30 and chic. Their paper menus were okay but it's the chalkboard menu that is the main appeal of this place. The chalkboard menu changes often and shows daily specials and deals. 

They have one chef, so if you want your order to come within an hour, you have to order the moment you sit down if you're the first cohort that goes in. We took 5 min to order and our order came an hour later. 

The taste was alright. Things tasted as they should, but nothing really stood out. My toast had scallions which I knew about but I still am iffy about it. If you like that stuff, then you'd like the whole meal. 

Portions are big! I eat a lot, so when I say this, I truly mean it. If you're hungry for brunch and aren't too picky, this is a good place. 

Their pancakes are a lot tougher than I expected. We got a plate to share and although it looked fluffy, biting into it surprised my teeth all the way to my roots. I like that it wasn't too sweet, but I def needed water to wash it down. 

Personally, I still like aunties and uncles a lot better."}
{"text":"As an SF native, I was skeptical of the so-called \"hipster district\" of Toronto. I put on my non-ironic retro glasses, grabbed a book, and headed out to discover this little restaurant. The barren wasteland that this restaurant is situated in is odd--but I scoped it out and noticed the charmingly named coffee shop next door, Ezra's Pound. Grabbed a DELICIOUS iced coffee, and waited for my tragic table for one (FML business travel). 

The specials list was ridiculous. I couldn't decide. Between pancakes, flautas, waffles, sammies & these amazing smoothies and coffee drinks (I think one was an avocado & espresso drink), I landed on the flautas. 

I sat in the little ally next to the restaurant outside, which was just lovely. Sunny and happy, I sipped on my monstrous iced coffee (yup, second in the hour) and read my book. Mismatched serving containers, funky furniture, potted herbs, and a teeny tiny table. 

And my food was delicious. Authentic Mexican, no way.  But it was their own take on flautas. It was sweet corn and melty cheese, with a homemade sweet salsa smothered on top. 

The only buzzkill was that they don't take credit cards, only 'debit' cards form Canada. I'm finding this is a trend everywhere in Canada, so best have your cash with you. Corporate card doesn't fare well here, really any Visa card doesn't. 

Thanks yelpers for the suggestions and descriptions!"}
{"text":"The place is very tiny, but well decorated. The food is even more pleasing the eyes. We ordered couple of dishes to try things out. Here's my opinion on the food- delicious, presented so well. Excellent place for not an ordinary food. Pictures are attached to this review."}
{"text":"I got the carrot cake pancakes, which were amazing. However, the reason for the 2 star review is because I found a long black hair cooked into my pancakes .... They offered to remake it for me, which I was a little hesitant yet agreed. I'm not sure if they forgot about me, but it took a ridiculous amount of time to remake the pancakes (40+ minutes). 

I won't be going back since both my friend and my stomach were so upset 2hrs after our meal."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places in town!

I love them for:
1. Awesome service (although I've heard mixed reviews here - my exp was really good)
2. Great food (specially their Rajesthani Breakfast and French Toast)
3. Ambience
4. Variety

Scope for Improvement:
1. The place is really small and hence a long waiting time during weekends"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to love this place.  It's often touted as a hipster hang out, and when I'm not hearing about how cool it is, I'm hearing about how good the food is.  But no one thought to tell me some vital information about this little breakfast nook.

NO FRIED EGGS.

If you want to go out for a classic sunny side up, or some over easy, do not come here.  They just don't do it.  Once in a while you can have runny eggs if poached is a special of the day, but that's not often.

Learning this (the hard way) was a big bummer for me because the first time I went, I was really in the mood for a good ol' bacon and sunny side up eggs.

So, after being egg-blocked on this one, I got over myself and decided to order the French toast.  I must say that I was impressed.  They make their French toast out of a French baguette, and they'll even carmalized some brown sugar for that added flavour.  Yummy food, indeed.  

But no fried eggs."}
{"text":"Every time I come to saving grace it is the same experience. The food is always amazing and the service is always terrible. 

Today a group of 5 of us arrived at 9:40 am to secure our first spot in line. We were seated first at 10:00 am promptly and ordered by 10:07 am. Before we even got our food the table next to us had eaten, settled their bill, and left. At 10:55 am, 50 minutes after ordering, two out of five plates arrived at our table. At 11:00 the rest of the food came, to add to the disappointment one plate was the wrong order. 

The food was delicious. 

While we were eating, the newly seated table of two ordered and were delivered their food at 11:07 am. It took them less than 20 minutes to order and receive their food while it took us an hour to receive ours. 

Not a single thing was done in regards to our bill, and a 15% gratuity was added onto it. 

When confronted about the service nothing was done about the bill and the owner refused to speak with us."}
{"text":"We live just around the corner from Saving Grace so one grey Saturday when there was no line and an empty table available, we gave it a try to see what all the hype is about.

We came to the conclusion that the only reason why there's always such a long line outside is because of the poor organisation. There was only one waitress which is clearly not enough for that many tables. She seated us with a menu and it took her 30 minutes to come back with water and to take our order. 30 minutes. Customers were not served in the order they came in, at all. A couple that came after us got served and already left before we even got our food. I don't blame the poor waitress because it's hard to keep track of that many people but it was disappointing.
And then it took another 40 minutes to get the food. We spent 1.5 hours there, for breakfast.

The food was alright but not extraordinary and definitely not worth waiting for. Just regular breakfast you can get at many other places in this neighborhood without the wait.

If you think this place is great because people are waiting outside, don't be fooled! Go there when you have a lot of time and there's no line."}
{"text":"Got the coconut pancakes with bananas - very sweet but delicious. Crispy too!! Service was OK. Didn't have to wait to be seated but had to ask server two times for more coffee. Would go back!"}
{"text":"I've only ever been here on weekday mornings so I've never had to deal with the line-ups. I can see how this would easily be a problem on weekends because the place is tiny.

That being said, I love the food. If you like sweet things for breakfast, you will love the french toast with caramelized bananas."}
{"text":"Always looking for a new brunch place. Found this place after searching online for good brunch place. It was close by, and there were many recommendations online and from blogs. 

Decided to check it out. The food here is really good actually. Had the quesadilla, waffles pancakes and side of sausage including a coffee. I liked their coffee alot, it was really good. The quesadilla and waffle pancakes were really good too. I would recommend both."}
{"text":"This place is small and your wait will more definitely be long (unless you should up early -- they open at 10 on the weekend). However, once you actually get a seat in Saving Grace, it's great. 

I don't know how they turn brunch classics into awesome and interesting combos I would have never thought of! I've been here a few times and the options never fail to excite. Some highlights include the savoury french toast, the espresso-avocado shake, and the brie & hazelnut omelet."}
{"text":"The vibe: Super tiny spot that looks like it could be in your cool aunt's kitchen. The sunshine pours in reflecting off the lightly painted walls. It's a feel good place to wash away your troubles and cozy up to some friendly strangers from the Trinity Bellwoods neighbourhood. 

The food: The specials are always incredible. This ain't your greasy diner. It's a well thought out creative menu with healthy options. I've never had a meal I haven't liked. Just trust them and try something new.

The drinks: The Espressado is amazing. Avocado + espresso = heaven. 

My go-to meal: When I'm feeling like I want that AM sugar rush, I go for the French toast with caramelized bananas and get a side of sausage. Hubba wubba. 

Secret: Come early!"}
{"text":"Cute place! It was only a 15 minute wait, but with the other reviews I read here, I could hardly wait to get that brunch in my mouth. 

We got sat and I ordered the Mexican-styled one with a little wrap + delicious scrambled eggs and masala chickpeas I believe. The food is impeccable. It's different than your usual Benedict brunch. It's Toronto style brunch with all the different spices and different cooking style. It's a bit spicy which is perfect for me since I love spicy. 

The place is quaint and a bit small (aka line ups) so expect to wait 15 or more minutes after you come by and write your name. 
Also they're not open Sundays. Which is redonk as brunch is done best on Sundays. It's a thing! 

The service could be better, but it wasn't as bad as I anticipated from past reviews. They were quite friendly, but not as attentive such as not filling your glass up with water after you're done.

If I was around the area I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I love brunch as much as the next person, but I usually end up disappointed when friends drag me to new brunch places. I mean fried eggs can only be so good.

Or so I thought until I had brunch at Saving Grace.

I wasn't too impressed when I had to wait outside in the cold for 15 minutes, but the wait was definitely worth it. I got the pan fried eggs with pickled vegetable and maple bacon. I know it's blasphemous, but I'm not usually a big fan of bacon. But the plate was so well balanced, it left me wanting more. It was totally a different style from the typical greasy breakfast that I learned to expect from a brunch place. 

That being said, the place runs on the expensive side. But you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at this place. I hate lines so when I visit this place I go on the weekdays. I don't like how this place is randomly closed out of the blue but other than the inconvenience that poses, I still keep returning. The food is delicious. Best brunch/breakfast in the city. Fresh and flavourful. I always try something different on the menu and I like the variety of food they offer with daily specials. I always order the banana French toast for dessert :)"}
{"text":"Came with a bunch of friends for brunch and was excited to try this place out. The menu is quite extensive and the wall posts several daily specials. The staff was nice and gave their recommendations and any help needed.
The reason for the 2 stars is they do not have AC. It kind of baffles me that a hipster spot downtown would not have AC. Our entire group was very uncomfortable throughout the meal and could not enjoy our food.
Ok, so food. We ordered quite a few different dishes and drinks. I can say all were very tasty and was an interestingly fusion of Mexican and Asian elements. Most dishes were filling, except for the waffles which came with two small pieces.
I'll be honest and say, I wanted to enjoy my meal but could not on this occasion because of the blazing heat."}
{"text":"The best thing I like about eating at neighbourhood-style independent nooks that serve mainly breakfast and brunch is that the presentation and flavor of the dishes take on such an experimental and artistic form.
And I've no hesitation of placing Saving Grace under that category. Also included on the upside of these types of eateries is that the experience and ambiance is created by the environment of the sort of patrons who go there.
I trusted an acquaintance's suggestion to try out this place and was not disappointed by our dining experience. After waiting for awhile we were seating on the upper level at a communal-style table near the kitchen. The other four customers, three of whom were vaguely Greek or Spanish looking women decked out in black attires like they just left a sermon at Church in Italy immediately made me feel like I was having lunch somewhere in the Greek Cyclades a view overlooking the Mediterranean, even though I've never been there before.That's certainly a strong example of the sort of trip that environment around you in a restaurant can create.
The main two paged menu has a limited choice of dishes which makes selecting rather easy but I decided to get something from the chalkboard, a Carrot Cake spiced Waffle and a side order of Roasted Potatoes and a Mochachino beverage while my friend picked the Rajasthani from the menu.
It does take a brief wait for the dishes to arrive but it's worth it as both our dishes were very well assembled. My waffles were placed at a half circular angle on the plate and each one was topped with what tasted like clotted cream (it just didn't have the same sweetness of commercial whipped cream and was slightly thicker than that) and slices of strawberries. The flavor of the waffle was not really sweet which made it better to eat it with the syrup. But I could certainly taste the same flavors that one would find in a carrot cake. I'm glad I went for this unique selection. My friend's dish was almost identical to the customers' pictures for this restaurant. I even caught a glimpse of what the next group of people at our table order and the craftsmanship of the dishes was not flawed.
I hope to come back again to this summery ambient place when the weather gets warm again."}
{"text":"This place seems to be impossible to get a seat at, and I'm not really sure why people go crazy for this place. I admit it's nice and quaint, but it's not amazing by any means and certainly not worth waiting more than 10 minutes for. There are certainly better (and bigger) options.

Having said that, the brunch I've had here was good. It was the summertime and everyone seemed to be happy and cheerful with the sun shining in the window on my corncakes and coffee. If someone asks me to go to Saving Grace with them then I will be there. I don't mind waiting a little bit if I am hanging out with a friend on a nice day..."}
{"text":"Brilliant brunch. In fact, probably one of the BEST brunches in Toronto, and that's saying a lot! (PS this review isn't based on one brunch, but a bunch o' brunches...I've eaten here occasionally over the years and it's consistently stellar.)

But here's the deal...this place is tiny. If you plan to come here during peak brunching hours, this is what you do: Go in and add your name to the queue. Then, walk west for 10 seconds until you reach Ezra's Pound, where you can enjoy a nice lil pre-brunch coffee while you wait!

Everything I've ever eaten at Saving Grace has been delicious. The famous caramelized banana french toast is divine. Dip a bite of that wonderfully crunchy, banana-topped toast into the caramel goo oozing on your plate, followed by a dip in the maple syrup, and you're in brunch heaven. (The dish comes in a half order as well....no matter what we order here, we always share a half order of banana french toast on the side!)

I also recently ate some of the best scrambled eggs of my life here...they were cheesey scrambled eggs cooked to perfection, served with bacon and a side of waffles topped with incredible caramelized apples. Whoa, these folks have nailed the art of caramelization! :) In the past I've also ordered baked eggs in tomato sauce, Mexican-inspired breakfast dishes, etc. I've literally never been disappointed. Oh, and their smoothies are also on point. Try the espresso/avocado smoothie for something deliciously different.

So go forth my children, and brunch to your heart's content."}
{"text":"Although this place is very, very tiny in size it makes up for it with the delicious brunch choices.  I love brunch.  So many choices of delicious meals.
This place has got to be one of my favorite places for brunch.
The seating is very tight as there are not too many tables but the wait process is not too bad and well worth the wait.
Upon arrival you put your name on the list hanging on a clipboard just inside the door.  Process works very well as they go through the list.  You may have to wait a little longer if you are more than 2 or 3 but, trust me it is as i mentioned, worth the wait.
We had a party of 5 and had to wait about 1/2 hour so not too bad.  The aromas coming from the doorway were to die for and made us hungrier.
My son ordered the Espresso Shake.  Delicious and creamy shake with you guessed it espresso and for the creaminess, avocado!
Large variety of juices and coffees on the menu so there is something for everyone.
I personally ordered the French Toast with apple, caramelized onions and Gruyere cheese.  Comes with salad and crispy smashed potatoes.  Absolutely delicious.  The French Toast was perfectly done and the flavors of the apple, onions and the melted cheese were heavenly.  The smashed potatoes were nice and crispy. 
Everyone in my group loved their dishes with one tiny glitch, my daughters corn tortillas was supposed to come with avocado.  As she was eating we wondered and discussed where the avocado was.  We thought it may have been inside the tortilla so she happily ate the whole thing.  we then see the gentleman next to us get the same dish and his arrived with a huge dollop of avocado on the top of the tortillas!! 
Well, just a tiny glitch.  For a holiday morning where they were busier than usual we forgave them!  (This time!)
We would definitely return for more and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Cute, casual and small.

I liked that they had many options of the day on the chalk board, along with a standard menu.

We ate:
- Burmese (?) omelette stir fry (3/5): This was good, but nothing mind blowing.
- Pear & Almond pancakes (3/5): Again, okay, nothing I will really remember.

Overall, it was fine for an impromptu brunch, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"They let you split some orders into halves. So I had 1/2 order of date pancakes and 1/2 order of waffles. Pancakes really good, waffles okay. or by the time I got to waffles, I was already full. Worth the money, not the wait.

They do not seat you unless everyone in your party is there. Which makes sense since it is  small place but would have preferred to know in advance. They also do not split cheques on the weekend, which does not make sense. It is easier on everyone involved. Also no credit. 

Anyhow, the food is good but I may not wait in a long lineup."}
{"text":"We had Sunday Brunch for the first time at this west end spot. We were lured by pictures and reviews about the Banana French Toast and were not disappointed!!

It IS as good as the pictures depict. We also had a waffle of the day, which was Caramelized Pear and Pecan with Ginger butter. Both were wonderful and were shared, so we could savor the differences.

We looked around and saw other wonderful meals which we will have to try next time (frittata, baked eggs).

Just a few notes: 
-  I would recommend getting there a bit before they open to ensure you get a table. It is a small place and fills up quickly. 
- btw - to those of you who wait in line to get in, it is polite to let those who have waited longer to get a table first.  It is not nice to cut in. 
- the waiting staff were very nice and refilled our coffee a number of times (which was very good). They give each table a bottle of water (great idea!). 
- entrees range from $8-12 but they are good sized and you will go away well satisfied 
- make sure you note the address and the signage is not obvious (painted on the window only) - but if you are driving it is easily missed.
- payment is cash or debit card only 

We'll be back again to try something else. It was a great brunch!"}
{"text":"While the food was good, the service could've been a lot better. Also, I had to change what I wanted to order twice because each time they didn't have one of the components of the dish in the kitchen that day."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to stop by for brunch for awhile, but the lineup was always too long. We finally visited on a Saturday morning this past weekend, and there was already a lineup even before it opened. So, tip: if you don't want to wait long to get seated, come early! This place opens at 10:00 AM on Saturdays - we arrived at 9:45 AM, stood in line, and were seated around 10:10 AM, when they finally started letting customers in.

First, the parking situation. We found free street parking just east of the restaurant on Claremont Street (where I think there's a parking limit of 1 hour). 

Second, the service. I was expecting pretty terrible service after reading reviews but we actually had a very friendly server that was all smiles, very prompt, and attentive! A great, and very welcome surprise.

Third, the food. Honestly, this meal was just average to us. If you're looking for bigger portion sizes, this isn't a bad choice, but we felt like taste and deliciousness wasn't all there. We ordered two of their specials: a) the cornbread waffles with fried egg topped with apricot chutney and pea meal bacon, which comes with salad and a side of hummus, b) the egg frittata which also came with salad and hummus, c) the Avocado Espresso (Espressado), and d) some loose-leaf tea. While the ingredients seemed hot and fresh, the textures actually felt weird to us - the pea meal bacon was super tough and difficult to bite into, and the frittata was harder in texture and super fried. The cornbread waffles were also kind of grainy and didn't have a flavour that we totally enjoyed. The Avocado Espresso was actually delicious but really heavy - I couldn't quite finish it. Overall, it wasn't a terrribbble meal but it made us feel really heavy and sluggish afterwards, and the flavours weren't absolutely and totally enjoyable..

It's a decent spot with some pretty unique options on its menu, so it wouldn't hurt to check it out at least once, but overall, the food was just average for us.

For two people, with tax, and tip, we paid around $45.00."}
{"text":"The food here, is without a doubt, delicious. Wafting through the doors is a comforting aroma of indian-infused breakfast foods. 
All the reviews that give this place anything lower than 3 stars is clearly due to the wait, the service, or the space. The wait is tough to bear, the service could be better, and certainly, the space could be bigger given its popularity. However, the space is small probably because that's all the kitchen can handle. The wait, well, that's just a factor of the small space/kitchen. The service is a bit odd... I can't blame the lack of attention on the waitresses themselves, simply because they appeared to be short handed. I saw one waitress handle the floor by herself the entire time I was there. There were maybe 3 runners, only one of which helped out with the duties of the floor (calling out names from the wait list, taking orders some of the time). They clearly need at least one more floor server.
The food... oh it's delicious and I'd say it's worth about the 35 minute wait that we had. The poached eggs with bruschetta and melted provolone was just the best and the rajasthan eggs were unique and savoury and satisfying. Coffee was decent too... only wish was for a more attentive refilling service. 
Despite the wait, I am a fan of the cooking. I suppose I'm glad I ended up here as a result of the Hoof Cafe being closed for the holidays."}
{"text":"i visited Saving Grace for the first time based on a combination of Yelp reviews and the concentrated interest of a friend. wanting to try something new and thinking it would live up the acclaim i obliged to try Saving Grace.
when we arrived to a large lineup and the somewhat significant weight of a typically decent brunch spot in TO my expectations heightened. grabbing an Americano at Ezra's Pound next door made the wait more tolerable. however, after 30 minutes the receipt of my entrance was lacklustre. the server sat us with little fanfare in a more rushed than welcoming manor. she didn't ask if we wanted anything to drink and took a significant time taking our order. not listing the day's specials we read them off the board and both decided to order the pumpkin & red-bean burrito.
the unusually long and unacceptable time for our food to arrive also came with little reward. the filling in the burrito was good, but didn't burst with flavour and the tortilla was overdone, being more crispy than warm and soft. the salad was well dressed, but the hair inside killed my appetite. 
perhaps it was because the main chef/owner was away on vacation that the disorganized and unsanitary kitchen delivered me this underwhelming experience or maybe Saving Grace is loosing their touch. either way it will take a lot of convincing to return."}
{"text":"I loved this place!! Service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious. I had the Mexican tuna melt. It comes on two crispy blue corn tortillas and is fresh and flavourful. The green salad is comes with is pretty mediocre, but the melt itself steals the show. Also tried the avocado espresso shake - AMAZING!!! Looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"I am writing about an awful experience I just had at this restaurant. We waited in the bitter cold for over an hour and a lady who had just arrived was seated as soon as she got there before us. I then approached the server, \"Maddy\" and asked her about this and she rudely said \"that girl works here and if you work her you can come whenever you want and you don't have to write your name down... you can just come\". I had a huge problem with this and asked if I could have the number to complain to the owner and she rudely said \"you can look up the number on our website on your own\". She not only butted us in line, but butted every other person in line including another couple who did not even get the chance to sit down because the restaurant closes at 2:30 and this employee took their spot in line. I am so disgusted with the customer service and the unfair treatment in this matter. You should be seated regardless of whether you are an employee or a customer, based on the time you write your name down on the list. If I could give her zero stars I would. This waitress also has a huge attitude problem."}
{"text":"We could not even follow through with our reservation as they did not have seating for a child and no room for a stroller- disappointed!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. You have to wait outside in the freezing cold for at least an hour before you can get a table! They won't let you wait inside which is inhumane! A lady had a one-year-old infant and still was not allowed to wait inside. Also, my colleagues and I visited this restaurant three weeks prior to this terrible experience, and it was closed with no notice on the website. We travelled all the way there just to find out it was closed! Terrible experience and definitely do not recommend unless you like freezing till the point of hypothermia."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch in Toronto. Amazing food, quaint decor, and good prices. They offer standard brunch options, as well as creative specials. We had frittatas with ham, sauerkraut, whole grain mustard, and Swiss cheese, smoked salmon with scrambled eggs on toast with fried capers, and waffles with sour cream lime sauce and fruit. The smoked salmon was some of the best I've ever tried. Last time, I had tiramisu waffles which were absolutely delicious. Their waffles are the best I've tried in Toronto. One caveat is that you will have to wait. I waited for an hour and a half, but the food was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came across this place in a blogTO article about brunch places in Toronto! They took us in after 30 minutes ( You got to write your name on a writing pad hung at the entrance and wait around).  I went there for their Rajasthani eggs, its a perfect dish to opt for if you are confused between an Indian and an English breakfast! The scrambled eggs are spicy and the paratha is more like soft, spicy bread. The masala chick pea with yoghurt went well with the combo. Also ordered their popular avocado espresso shake, it was different but felt  like melted ice cream to me. My friend went with their specials (eggs migas ) which was quite flavorful too!"}
{"text":"If you love French toast, you gotta go here, and order their French toast. Caramelized bananas on what I thought was a baguette?! Unreal. This place definitely spells brunch with a capital BR. If you prefer breakfast over lunch when you're brunchin, this is a good call. Strange ambiance though, was playing fetty wap when the setting called for the Lumineers. If you're gonna be trendy, get the music to match. Vibes gotta match the setting. It's all about \"good vibes\" and ambiance now a days after all!"}
{"text":"Eating at Toronto's Saving Grace is an inspiration to any foodie. It's like the restaurant I would want to own, serving up the kind of comforting and tasty food combo's I wish I thought of!

It was my first time there at the beginning of Feb 2010... and I know I'm a little late discovering the weekend brunch at this west-end, beyond hipster hot spot. But give me a break! I've been living in Vancouver for the last 5 years so I'm still getting re-acquainted with Toronto's food gems. Sitting cozy in Saving Grace's dining room squished together with 20 others, I contemplated for nearly 20 minutes about what to eat. There's a regular permanent menu which looked delicious, but you're also tempted by a chalk board crammed with daily specials ... everything from savory to sweet.  Most people complain about waiting for a table at this restaurant, but I got lucky and was seated for 3 right away. I think if you get there at 10 am when they open, or by 10:30 when I did on a Saturday you should be fine. Well I opted for the Scrambled Egg feature. Pomegranate Guac is exactly the kind of thing I wish I had done. Of course, now I'm going to make it and claim it as my own.... Shh don't tell... since it was delicious and refreshing. My mouth was dancing with flavors from the eggs melted with Monterey Jack, the black beans mashed with onion and cilantro, and the lightly herbed and salted potatoes... and all this was only complemented by an incredible Americano. I wish I could have stuffed the scrumptious muffins in my tummy too. Baked fresh was a lavender pistachio and pear hazelnut variety. Ultimately, I made a wise menu choice, but I can't get this food out of my head. A menu staple that makes me drool is the old cheddar, avocado sandwich on whole-wheat raisin bread with rosemary mayo. Yum! While I am going to experiment with creating some of these dishes myself, I'm sure I'll be lined up at Saving Grace again in no time!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, I'm not sure what all the hype is about. The service was awful. The waitress was very short. It just wasn't the experience we were looking for."}
{"text":"Eggs Rajasthani made a perfect start to my day. A perfectly fresh dish free of the usual brunch grease and stodge. The Espressado (Espresso and Avocado shake) blew my mind, so delicious.. I'd go back to Toronto just for one of those."}
{"text":"2.5 stars- I wanted to love this place, but the service made it really hard to. 

Service: I came on a weekend with one friend and we arrived at 10 (when they're supposed to open), but they weren't ready yet so there was a line outside. Weird, but it wasn't too cold so I didn't mind waiting. When we were finally seated, it took about 20 minutes to even get a glance from the waitress to bring coffee... At one point I asked a server if we could get coffee and water, and she just told me she doesn't take orders and walked away. This trend continued with the food service, which took just as long- it seemed like there was only one waitress and no real system. The people after us in line had their food before we even had a chance to order??? Everything just took SO LONG

Food: Luckily, the food was good enough to make the experience more neutral here. My friend got the sweet waffles and I got a savoury egg dish. Both our meals were satisfying and a good size for the price. I had a bite of my friend's waffles and they were SO GOOD, so if you go, I'd recommend trying the waffles! 

Overall, I probably wouldn't come here again- the food was good, but there are lots of GOOD brunches in the city with faster/better service."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service wasn't fantastic...waitress not friendly.  Waitress never came and checked on us.  Very limited space, would not let our party of three move to a slightly larger table.  Not sure why everyone loves this place so much..."}
{"text":"Loooooove brunch. And this place delivers. Went at nine during the week, so there wasn't a wait but it fills up fast. The daily specials are super hard to choose from, but we landed on mushroom gruyere poached eggs and \"Welsh rarebit\". Not at all traditional rarebit, and I was pretty dubious cuz it didn't look wildly appetising, but everything was GREAT. Coffee was pretty perfect, and the espressado thing is weird but tasty and worth a try. Bonus was leaving full and satisfied, but not feeling at all like death from crazy portions or overly rich food."}
{"text":"I'll be brief because my experience is similar to other reviewers:

Food was very good. Not excellent but very good.

Service is sporadic.

Worth visiting if you don't have to wait for long and/or they aren't busy."}
{"text":"The restaurant is incredibly small so if you don't come early, good luck getting a table. If you come late and willing to wait 30-45 mins, remember to put your name down on the clipboard!! 

Service is quite good but the food took quite sometime to arrive. I liked how there are different varieties of dishes on the main menu along with the constantly updated special menu. I also thought the price was quite fair for the portion. 

-Rajasthani eggs - $13
The scrambled eggs were under-seasoned and I didn't think the potato nor red onion went well with the eggs, but I loved the masala chickpea! It was not too spicy (for me) and you can differentiate all the different spices in the masala, and the yogurt was much needed to tone down the heat. The paratha was spicy as well but a bit too dry and crumbly.

-Savory french toast - $11.50
The toast was soft and delightful. I thought the gruyere cheese would be quite strong but it was not the case. The nutty and creamy taste of the cheese complimented perfectly with the sweet caramelized apples.

-Waffles Dulce de leche - $11
The waffle wasn't too soft and have a slight golden brown crust on top. I loved that they used plantain here instead of banana as they tends to be a bit more sugary or creamy, whereas plantain still remained that hint of savoriness. And of course how can you say no to dulce de leche?!"}
{"text":"This place always has inventive menu options, but the food isn't as good as it sounds, and its definitely not worth the hype (and resulting long wait times). 

I've eaten here on two occasions. Both times, the server was cold and seemed rushed, and both times the kitchen screwed up my order. I've received burned, overcooked eggs, and a mess of French toast that was bland and dry. I ordered the French toast because the menu explicitly said \"maple syrup\", but the dish was served with gross table syrup. When I asked about it, the server said the owner didn't want to pay for real maple syrup anymore. I understand that real maple syrup is expensive, but they shouldn't advertise something and then clearly deliver a different dish. 

Their ginger tea and juices are refreshing, and their proximity to Trinity-Bellwood's makes them an attractive brunch option in the summer. Still, as a resident of the neighbourhood, I'll walk an extra 10 minutes to any other brunch spot in the area before waiting for poorly cooked food and a crowded, rushed brunch experience."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon, we were going to The Hoof first but then they told us it will be 1 hour and half wait. I checked with yelp, and Saving Grace is 2nd one down the list for Brunch in this neighbourhood.

I wasn't impressed with the space because it is small. We are a party of 4, and The Hoof was even worst for any group of people for 2 or more.

This whole area is filled with small and unique brunch places and I should have read the review more carefully when I get here.

And, yes, first of all, if you get here during weekend, put your name down on the Waiting list paper on the door, so you get your 'next-in-the-line' spot.

there is absolutely no waiting area, you go in, and the tables are right in front of you and right next to you. During winter time to go there during weekend and during peak hour (11 to 2) is a bad idea. Unless you don't mind waiting outside freezing. 

We ordered poach eggs, omelette, baked eggs..etc. Each dish are around $11.50. They are good dish but I think they can really do better. 

The food also took a while to get to the table , literally we are almost fainted due to low blood sugar waiting so long to get a table (over 30min).

Overall, I would give the food 'A-OK', it's unique but it's not like I would come back here again or too often due to the waiting time and small spaces."}
{"text":"Oh my F'in gawd!...definitely worth the 45 minutes wait. I had the panfried eggs with green beans and turkey sausage with spicy honey almond pesto...out of this world. My friend had the waffles...let's just say we don't need to eat for days :)"}
{"text":"I used to live on Bellwoods across the street from this restaurant when I wasn't vegan lol and this is my spot! A constant rotating menu of brunch specialities from around the world, Brazilian breakfast & Rajistani Eggs plus standard epic fare like smoked turkey sausage, caramelized banana French toast, super favorites like Lavender and rhubarb soda water - I have eaten my way through this whole menu and it's my favorite brunch place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Come early or late OR you will be waiting for a seat. Extremely limited seating here. Be prepared to wait outside as there is no room inside to wait. Which by the way can be awkward as some people like to eerily stare in at you the entire time you are trying to eat. Other people (the normal ones) will just talk amongst themselves outside. Why are people so weird??


On to the food. Ya its good, but it's just brunch!! Definitely a step up from your greasy diner mind you, but I won't be making a special trip here or anything. If I'm in the hood this is a good option. If I'm not in the hood, there are excellent options elsewhere.

Also the uber hipster vibe totally throws me off."}
{"text":"Even though their service is a little slow , it is well worth it since everything is freshly cooked and perfectly spiced. First time in TO and would def come here again. Perfect little hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love waiting almost an hour after ordering for my food to come on a weekday, said no one.

I hear so much hype about this place, so and while the food was delicious, make no mistake, it was absolutely not worth the over 45min we sat waiting for our order. I was less impressed when half an hour after I ordered, the waitress told me they were out of a side we had both chosen and we had to pick something else. 

But the food was really, really lovely, so you have to decide if it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fantastic food but terrible service. We arrived at 10:15am on a Saturday morning so we just missed the first round of seating. I went to put my name on the clipboard and we were already the 3rd party in line.  My recommendation is to get here at 10am otherwise you can expect an hour wait.  It was a chilly morning and I was freezing sitting outside (yes I know, my fault for not checking the weather) so I went inside in attempt to warm up.  The hostess immediately came down and told me to wait outside.  I explained to her it's really cold outside, I just want to stand inside for a minute to warm up, nope, that didn't cut it. Not only she didn't care, she angrily told to me go wait outside because that's the rule, EVERYONE (with emphasis) needs to wait outside.  How rude!

Since I already committed 45mins of my time, I wasn't going to give up my table so easily.  I wish I had shitty or mediocre food so I can say I've tried it and I'm never coming back but the food was delicious! Now I know why people are so committed every weekend to come here for breakfast/brunch. 

We each ordered a specialty egg dish on the blackboard and a half order of waffle for dessert.  I love how they put an international spin to your traditional egg dishes.  I inhaled my poached eggs on polenta with tomato sauce (starving after an hour wait).  We also ordered a turkey sausage on the side, OMG it's was delicious!  The waffle and French toast was good too. 

I don't think I will come back on a weekend unless I can make it just before 10am."}
{"text":"Not worth a visit. The hostess skipped us while we were waiting outside, doubling our wait time. They had run out of many things in the menu, which is understandable but still a mark against the establishment in light of everything else. Ourserver was rude and inattentive, food was fine but I left hungry and feeling an unfriendly vibe generally. I'd say this place feels rather full of itself. Skip!"}
{"text":"YAY BRUNCH! 

While there is a bit of a wait for a table, and not a lot of room inside the restaurant, the food is pretty fantastic! 

After about a 25 minute wait on a Sunday, my brunch partner and I finally made it into Saving Grace. While our table was a BIT cramped, and a couple next to us were a BIT too into making out, the service was quick and the food was unreal. 

There is a chalk board with the daily specials on the wall, and once I saw the sweet potato, eggs and sausage special, I just couldn't say no. This came with a delicious salad (as it seemed to me most of the options do) as well as some hash browns (not the best, but nothing could have competed with my sweet potatoes). They also serve coffee in cute little mismatched cup and saucer sets, which I just loved. 

I could definitely see myself coming back here and trying more of the options, but I might wait until it's a bit warmer out so I don't have to wait in the cold!"}
{"text":"My friend and I go to saving grace probably every week. Each time we go there's new and amazing specials on the board that we order without fail.

I rarely order from the main menu because their specials are always so interesting and delicious! But the sandwiches on the regular menu are very good.

The lines are long but it's worth the wait. The service is quite quick as well even if they are packed to capacity (which is often). 

All in all great brunch restaurant!"}
{"text":"If you're not very hungry and have a whole lot of time to kill, you're going to love Saving Grace! 

After waiting 30+ minutes for a table on a weekday morning, you'll be sat by a curmudgeonly server. After an undetermined amount of time, you'll get... a menu! Then, after staring at the menu for a good 10 minutes, your order is taken. And that's when the real fun begins! 

So now your order is in, and for the next 45 minutes, you get to guess whether or not the next plates will be yours. Nope! They're for the people who came in 20 minutes after you, sucker. 

Finally, the food arrives. By the vivid 20 ingredient descriptions on the chalkboard menu, you know you're in for a treat. Actually, it's just a sad looking plate with little substance and zero flare. So you eat your meal in 3 minutes because they've left you to the point of starvation, and sit there wondering what just happened. You look at your empty plate and sigh, realizing that the good reviews were really just the ramblings of famished Yelpers, who were so hungry that they would have rated 5 stars on brick of cheese. 

Icing on the cake: \"Oh, we actually don't do separate bills.\" 

Fuck. This. Place."}
{"text":"visiting toronto two years later and this place did not disappoint. we ate here twice in five days and found every dish to be perfection. yes, there's a wait. yes, the service is slow, but good things are always worth the wait. everything is made to order, the ingredients are fresh, everyone there takes pride in their work - if you don't notice these things when you're there, you're not paying attention.

we absolutely adore saving grace and we wouldn't change anything about it - it's all the little things that make this place wonderful. coming from san francisco that has its share of very special brunch spots, i would have to say that saving grace is my favorite brunch of all time."}
{"text":"Meh.  I'd heard tons of great things about this place and decided to check it out this weekend with a coupleo f friends.  I don't know what all of the hype is about... what made the place great was the company.

The food was alright... could have made it myself at home.  One of my friends said that her food was great, just to contrast.  And the service was shit.  We had to ask ou server to clear off our table, after waiting about 20 minutes.  I'll give her that maybe she was having an off day and that's fine that she didn't notice the plates from the last people.  We also had to move three times.  Here's a tip... if you want a good table, make your party one of 4 people.  They'll move you to a table of 2 if you've only got 3 in your party.

Coffee.  Watery.  And it was a latte!  My friend said that her coffee was good though.

Here's the kicker... the menu yelled at us!  On the menu, at the bottom of one side, it tells us to \"Please be kind to your server.\"  On the other side, it notes that if you come into the restauant with drinks from anothe place, they'll charge you $.50!  I think that the exact words were \"Leave outside drinks OUTSIDE.\""}
{"text":"My cousin and I finally went to Saving Grace, a popular brunch place in Trinity Bellwoods. The place was packed when we arrived on a Saturday morning. I put my name down on a clipboard list of everyone who was waiting in line. We ended up waiting for around 75 minutes in order to get in. It was probably the longest I've ever waited for brunch.

Despite the long wait, the food and price was worth it. There's a standard menu and a chalkboard of their daily specials. I went for one of the specials of the day, which was the frittata. For only $12, I had a hearty brunch. I was satisfied and happy to have finally found a brunch place that was reasonably priced with a good amount of food.

If you live in Trinity Bellwoods, I highly recommend you go to Saving Grace if you haven't yet. It's a very quaint and small place (thus the long line ups) that's perfect for breakfast/brunch any day when you want to be by yourself or with a friend. I do not recommend coming in with more than 3 other friends due to the space."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Get their banana pancakes with dulce leche - that was my favourite. Unfortunately, service was pretty bad and waiting time is insane so go when they open! I wouldn't wait an hour for their food to be honest."}
{"text":"this place is overrated!! they took forever to take our orders and also forgot to give us the drinks we had ordered... very busy place but very little staff!!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. Got in right away but had to show up at 9:30. It was noisy with just people talking over each other. The waitress had a bit of an attitude. The service was very slow, food took more than an hour. I ordered the eggs shakshuka and was great. 
Overall, not a great atmosphere but good food."}
{"text":"Man, I read reviews about this place and the menu sounded intriguing so I decided to try it out. And holy mother of .. the wait ... man OH man. 

TO ALL THE FIRST-TIMERS: Go inside and write your name on the WAITING list. (I didn't know, which costed me 15 minutes)

On top of that, I had to wait in total 35 minutes. That's crazy, man. What's more crazy is that when I got the table after waiting that long, my cousin was stuck in trafic so I gave my table away which resulted in another 25 min wait. And that lucky bastard.... shortly after he arrived, he only had to wait 5 mins while I waited 1 hour + Let me just... alsdjf;lakjsdflkajsdfads9u3204!!!! 

So yeah, on to the food.These guys definately have an impressive assortment of brunch items to choose from. 
I ordered: ($11.50) \"Poached eggs on parmesan french toast bacon tomato jam arugala\" 
Not only is the name a mouthful, but so was the dish. They ran out of tomato jam, so it was substituted with tomato chutney which was fuckin' amazing. It was sweet and with a bit of the toast and runny yolk.. The PERFECT BITE. The flavours meshed really well. Delicious! Oh yeah, forgot to mention. The bacon tasted horrible... It was really overcooked and some bites tasted like rubber! Bleh. All but the bacon was good.

Friend's order: ($11.50) Rajasthani Eggs 
This was a dish FULL of different flavours. From the chickpea masala which came in a curry sauce accompanied with a roti skin to the light fluffy eggs fried with spicy red onions and tomato. I particularly favoured the chickpeas. I think one of the chef's was indian so it came out really well. 

Overall, the food was good. BUT, if you're gonna come here, do NOT, I repeat do NOT come by yourself. Always bring a friend so you won't be bored as hell when you wait to get in and wait to get your food 'cause the service was pretty slow."}
{"text":"This goes on my top 10 best places to have brunch in Toronto. I walked in with no expectations, but just needing a drink and they have this amazing, unique blend of Avocado and Espresso. Its almost like a smoothie, but amazingly well done...with just the right balance mix between avocado and the espresso coffee.

The place maybe small with long line up (if you turn up at the wrong timing), but the servers are great, although sometimes its only one server trying to juggle the whole space. Still its worth the Great Wall of China long lineup wait.
The menu changes from time to time, which makes it great too as there is always new dishes to tease and satisfy your palate and taste buds."}
{"text":"Ok, so I went back. I didn't have a coffee though, was too traumatized. I did notice though on the menu it say there's a 50c charge to bring in outside drinks. Hooray, that means you can get an Ezra's latte instead.
We had poached eggs on Parmesan French toast. It was pretty intense but tasted good. Service was a bit slow, and we went on a Thursday, so itr wasn't busy at all. I think these guys have a loyal enough fan-base to not really try."}
{"text":"My only regret is not having discovered this brunch spot sooner! Our server was super friendly, the menu has cool options (\"the usuals\" with a bit of flair) and the food was beyond delicious!! The food was beautifully presented, and for the amount of food on the plate, I think they under-charged us! (Especially if you consider what other \"hot spots\" on Dundas West charge...) We went on a Wednesday morning, we didn't feel rushed and I don't feel that we waited long between ordering & receiving the drinks/food. A definite \"will return\" and \"will recommend\"!"}
{"text":"Extremely cute brunch place that's always packed. Their avocado espresso milkshake is brilliant and their food is excellent. Super relaxed and not pretentious. I love this place!"}
{"text":"One of my brunch go-to's. Food is amazing, with special mention to the vietnamese(?) iced coffee. Wow. Incredible. 

Lost a star for the line up...don't need to reiterate what probably most other yelpers have said. Service is good, never had any issues."}
{"text":"The seemingly intimate space is actually comfortable thanks to the high ceilings and a pragmatic seating arrangement. I was lucky to find a seat so quickly considering folks were coming in just to put down their name on a clipboard. I was also pretty fortunate to score a seat with a panoramic view perfect for a laid-back brunch. I could glance into the busy kitchen and watch the two cooks do their thing in a space no bigger than a kitchen of an average apartment. Straight ahead, I could watch and eavesdrop on the irritating conversation of two overly narcissistic girls talking about their love interests. Instead, I opted to glance to the right and out the door where the street was bustling in a gorgeous sunny noon.

After confusing myself by looking at the chicken scratch on the massive chalk board hanging over my head, I picked something simple off the menu. Not long after, a plate arrived with two poached eggs, a couple of sausages, some toast and a green mix. I was instantly disappointed with the portions. I have to say that the eggs were actually poached perfectly and the sausages, though a bit on the dry side, were really ok. My grievance is more to do with the tiny portions and the $8-9 price for the meal. Given that the sausage and eggs of the same quality is something commonly found at other joints for far less, I think it's fitting to rate Saving Grace as 'I've experienced better'. I am sure the more colourful and interesting looking items on the menu such as the salads would impress me more but this is where I stand for now."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite brunch locations, as it's close to home and always satisfies my taste. They have a unique menu listed on their chalkboard from time to time with the classics of course, ordered something on the daily menu and it was delicious! Smoked salmon and sour dough with avocado and a side of greens. Would definitely come back but I'd go early on a Sunday morning as there's always a line up when they open at 10am."}
{"text":"I don't know who Grace is but I hope she isn't relying on this place to save her! My friend suggested a few places to meet for lunch and for some reason this place stuck out, I wonder why? Oh I know. It has some of the most hot and cold reviews on Yelp ranging from an impressive 5 stars to a disGRACEful 1 star.

I quickly read through and based myself for some shit service but worthwhile food. Although they managed to deliver on the crap service (we waiting for 15 minutes before we got our menu) they failed to wow me with their food.

Truth be told nothing on the menu impressed me, from the get go that is a problem. Usually there are multiple items that jump out at me begging for me to try them but here I felt almost cornered into getting the Tuna Melt (If you are a vegetarian, as my friend is though, I am told the selection is rather impressive). 

My melt tasted like it was missing something and the spices used were odd and distracting... I didn't even feel like I was eating Tuna. The side salad was boring, it was a chore to eat it. My steamed Hazelnut Milk was the most amazing part of my meal!

We were finished our meal and I noticed that all the waitresses were sitting above us on along the upstairs railing eating and starring at us (is this our cue to get out?) Someone walked in and they al told him they were closed. Wait what you're closed? It's 3pm on a Tuesday!

Maybe hype is the culprit here, because based on the reviews I had high expectations for this place. In any case, Grace definitely needs some saving (I am leaning more toward exorcism than a bandaid!)"}
{"text":"Nice inside cosy modern, prices are great.
The menu is diverse for brunch and lunch. Contemporary with a twist, not reaching too far, just enough to my my tummy rumble."}
{"text":"This is a review of the opening hours at Saving Grace, which I assume to be 10 am.  It is now 10:14 am on Saturday morning and I can observe in my seat at Ella's Uncle that 10 people are standing outside in the wet snow.  2 of them under an umbrella.  Oh! they were just allowed in."}
{"text":"Worst possible place to go for breakfast or brunch. You'll wait at least 20 minutes in line and then wait another 50-60 minutes for something as simple as French toast and coffee. Do not come here. Save yourself some time and go somewhere else! Would give zero stars or negative if I could. Food isn't even good either. Could have made it better at home for much cheaper."}
{"text":"Saving Grace is a  good Brunch spot . Came here last month with a group  . There is usually a wait for a table but its not a very long one .   Most of us got  the eggs rajasthani  and the banana pancakes  which was  better than expected and I got  eggs rajasthani and the avocado coffee .  I liked how the  food has a healthy feel to it and  the food itself is hearty and well portioned.  The avocado coffee tasted good and I was surprised that avocado can be made into a coffee.
Will return here next time with more groups for  brunches."}
{"text":"Worth the wait... but man what a wait.  I think if you come at 10:17, during a snowstorm, on a Wednesday you can walk right in, but otherwise bring a good book 'cuz you'll be lining up!

When you finally sit you'll have all the brunch options you've been waiting for - avocado, eggs, waffles, salads, high test coffee!  

The staff is fast and friendly but the prices are on the high side - brunch for 2 will run you north of $30.

One last tip - if you come in the summer wear a tank top because it is HOT inside!"}
