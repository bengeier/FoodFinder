{"text":"This place has decent food. The prices are high as to be expected with hotel restaurants. The biggest issue I have is their service. It took forever for them to get my water, and I was one of two people in the restaurant. The staff stayed busy with cleaning the place instead of paying attention to us. Really disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Ordered one social burger at 9:17 pm... it is now 9:47 pm and still no food... there's no one here eating so I really don't understand how it could possibly take this long. Even if this burger turns out to be the best burger I've ever had, it does not make up for the 30+ minute wait... RIDICULOUS.

Ok but the ketchup and mayonnaise bottles are cute  and service good so plus one star. 

Edit- added a star bc it was really good..."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place,but very slow service. We've been there twice while attending a convention and have had to wait in an uncrowded afternoon for over an hour. No one came by to refill our drinks . We had to walk up to the bar and request refills despite numerous restaurant staff running around. With a small selection of menu items , burgers , sandwiches and salads , it should not take an hour and a half to get served . Both times we complained and they took 50% of our bill. 

We will pass on this place next time .- Pat"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located inside the Sheraton hotel on the ground floor.  The menu offers small plates such as sliders and side salads and sandwiches to large plates including a roast chicken and fish of the day.  The meal started off with the right intent - prompt water service and greeting to take our order.  I ordered a small salad with light dressing, emphasized several times, and the salad came out drenched in dressing (other than that it was a good standard salad).  I also ordered the fish of the day which was awful and definitely not fresh - it was a yellowtail fish that had been cooked so long it was hard and dry in the middle.  Unfortunately, one of the diners in our party didn't receive their meal until well after the rest of the table was done eating.  They offered to comp the meal, which was the right gesture, but it was still really awkward to have one out of five people without a meal."}
{"text":"Social offers amazing food and cocktails in a great venue! 

For a starter we ordered the shrimp and chorizo appetizer which was hands down the best appetizer I have ever had. The tomato broth was divine and served with a crusty baguette perfect for sopping it all up.

For our main courses we enjoyed a burger and a mushroom melt. The foraged mushrooms were served on warm focaccia bread, with perfectly juxtaposed sweet fig jam and bitter arugula. Bit the french fries were the star...crisp, crunchy, and addictive! Dessert was churros with chocolate cookie crumble, salted caramel tequila ice cream, and mango. I did not taste much tequila in the ice cream, but I didn't much care. It was heavenly!

As for cocktails, the list was creative and exciting. My favorite was the Honeysuckle Mule--literally, Springtime in a glass. Local honeysuckle vodka, ginger beer, lime and basil. So good.

Ask for Heather! She was a killer bartender with wonderful conversation and a strong pour. She was knowledgeable about the menu and made wonderful recommendations. When she found out that we were celebrating our anniversary with a staycation at Le Meridian, she nonchalantly gathered our names and room number, and when we back to our room we were surprised by a gorgeous spread of Prosecco and chocolate strawberries. That kind of service is so rare these days and was such a delight for us! 

If you are in the Charlotte area, and ESPECIALLY if you are staying at Le Meridian or The Sheraton, do not pass up dinner at Social Bar & Kitchen. It was wonderful! Five stars!"}
{"text":"Inside the Sheraton/Le Meridien complex in Charlotte, a very good dinner! The biggest (rustic) croutons in a Caesar I have had (50/50) on that, but a delicious duck!"}
{"text":"Slowest service I have ever experienced. Seen 3 people walk out of here in the past 20 minutes. I'm still waiting for my tea. Btw stay away from simple things like bagels and croissants. They can't get that right either. Ordered a cappuccino yesterday and they messed that up as well. Go figure ..."}
{"text":"We checked into the hotel.  Was starving and trying to figure out our options.  The host was very nice.  Showed us a menu.  Explained everything to us.  We decided to stay.  The Ceasar salad was excellent and so was the burger.  Price is high, but expected for a hotel."}
