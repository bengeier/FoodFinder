{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese pho - soup is rich in flavour. Service is nice and attentive. I like how this place gives really fresh bean sprouts and different herbs to add in my pho."}
{"text":"This place is famous for Bun Cha Ha Noi , me and my hubby favorite dish here, Chao Long Doi , their Long Doi is the best. Also Ngan chat ( Steam Goose 1/2 ) with their ginger fish sauce is yummy ."}
{"text":"Com Pho The Ky is one of those restaurants that you can easily drive by without even noticing it being there.  It's not very appealing on the outside and a step into the restaurant, you will realize it's not very appealing inside either. The decor is completely off, it looks the owner took over an old Mediterranean restaurant and decided to take over all the decor as well.   So, how did we end at here? A restaurant with 3 star rating from only 3 yelp reviews? Because I was told this place has the best Bun Cha Ga and those that follow my reviews knows that I'm obsessed with finding the best bun ch ga in Toronto.  Without a doubt I ordered the bun cha ga and the verdict is...it's not bad but not the best.  The broth was legit but the fish cake was very very thin. It was so thin that I felt like I was eating just dough and a good bun cha ga needs to have good fish cakes. It's the star of the show!  The other reason why I only gave it a 3 star is because we found a piece of raw tripe on top of the veggies (mint, basil leaf and lettuce) they give you as a side!!!!  I'm sure it was just an accident but it's an accident that may cause me a accident had I accidentally ate it."}
{"text":"This is the best place for bun cha ha noi (grilled pork vermicelli). I've been here for 10 years and I would love to come back when I'm craving this dish.  Great combination while dipping vermicelli with fish sauce, grilled pork and herbs."}
