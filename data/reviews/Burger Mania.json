{"text":"Burger Mania huh? Well this place has a mean Chicago style hot dog. I've also tried their breakfast burritos and they are really good too. You can also choose from gyros, hot wings, seafood, burgers (duh), pancakes, the list goes on. The building is an old Wendy's conversion.  The place is filled with Chicago decor. Overall its a nice quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Fun for gamers, as they have retro arcade games!

Food is good too, especially the gyros.  Owner is from Chicago too, do that speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I love it here! I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they had vegetarian options! Their Vegetarian Burrito is bomb. Did I mention they have unlimited horchata?! This place is great, and I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Good solid Greek food.  Had the gyro plate and it was far better (and bigger) that the price would indicate.  Not fancy, but good food fast."}
{"text":"I have seen this place for years, then a coworker told me she loves it.
I don't mind paying more for a burger if it is worth it. The patty was paper thin,overcooked and tasted like it was pre cooked and then reheated. DISGUSTING. 
McDonalds .99 cent burger is better than this stuff.
On a good note, the sandwiches some patrons had looked alot better. Too bad I won't go back again to try those out."}
{"text":"First and foremost the food is pretty good. They have great gyros, I like their hot dogs, and their burgers are burgers. It's a decent place to grab lunch. Don't let the drive-thru fool you, this isn't a Mcdonalds where your food is ready in under a minute. You get cooked food for a reasonable price.  

What I love about this place is how friendly they are. Today when I went in for my lunch break there were two kids maybe 6 or 7. They walked up to the cashier and asked about the quarter machines. The owner went to the back, grabbed a key, opened the machine, and gave the kids a the exact prizes they wanted. It was a simple kind gesture and I really dig it. I mean, quarter machines are designed to generate extra income by enticing children to pay more and more to get what they want. This dude straight up hooked it up and insisted they didn't have to pay. The parents were grateful and I was impressed and immediately respected the establishment. 

I work in the area and will always drop by when I can for a hot dog or hamburger. OH! THEY HAVE GOOD FRIES! Real good."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Kind of sketchy from the outside so I'm glad we were feeling adventurous that day. 
We had burgers and gyros. They were both tasty. Gyros were sliced in front of us so no old meat laying around. Burgers were juicy. My husband loved that they had Tang. 
Lots of different foods on the menu. Seems like a little something for everyone. Only con was that they didn't have more burger choices. 
Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Love this place! The burgers have a very meaty taste to them, there are a lot of drink options, and they let you customize. My husband loves to get gyro meat put on his cheese burger.

They offer lots of different options such as hot dogs, BLT sandwiches, and more so you're sure to find something everyone in your party/family will eat. 

All in all, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yes, 5 stars...and here's why.  I base my reviews based on what should be expected from the type of restaurant you order from.  Plain and simple this is fast food. To justify each star I'll put it this way.  Star #1 - Value.  You get a lot of food for the price.  A \"small\" fry there is like a large at any other fast food place, you pay about the same price and the fries here are amazing.

Star#2 - Options... this place has so many choices it's kind of mind boggling.  I haven't really had anything here that I didn't like. I've tried Salad, burritos, gyros, burgers, BLT, etc. and everything is pretty good and well portioned.  Are you going to get the best burger you've ever had?  No...but they're well above average when you put it against any other fast food chain.  If you're a burger snob and seek out the best burgers...then you won't claim Burger Mania to be tops on the list..but if I have a choice between any chain out there, and Burger Mania, they're pretty damn good. The same goes for a lot on their menu.  Things are solid...not the best but pretty tasty.  But their fries, OMG...they are really good. 

Star #3 - Service - Everyone is pretty friendly, you sometimes find the owner here and he's always very nice. When you use the drive-thru,  you will wait a while...the bigger the order, the longer the wait...it isn't super speedy service...but do I care?  They are cooking food fresh to order.  You're not getting some thrown together piece of crap that's ready before you've even pulled out your wallet to pay.  You order it, they cook it...the way it should be.  Food is always piping hot, fresh off the grill, outta fryer, whatever.  Never had anything stale or old.  I don't mind waiting a couple extra minutes for fresh food.

Star #4 - cleanliness - The outside of the place is very wacky...kind of a joke really.  You pull up and you're thinking \"is this a kids place, a burger place, a taco place...It's called burger mania, but they're advertising Mexican food and Gyros...what the hell are those metal sculptures? Then you go inside and it is even more confusing...chicago sports decor, license plates, a ton of gumball vending machines, a video game here and there.  It's like they couldn't decide what kind of theme they wanted so they picked a little of everything and called it a day.  But maybe that's where the \"Mania\" comes from...it is total chaos, the decor...but the place is clean...sanitary, nothing gross.  That's what's important.  You serve good food...sanitary and clean....sure, go ahead and put a robot on your roof and have buzz lightyear flipping signs advertising your $4.99 special...it's all good to me!

Star #5 - Quality... Put your unrealistic expectations aside.  This is Burger Mania, not some fancy gourmet burger place.  You're not spending $15 on a burger with truffle fries here.  This is just good old fashioned diner style fast food, so you should base your expectations on that, pay a fair price, get fresh quality ingredients and be happy.  Stop judging it based on the exterior.  You'll get a tasty meal at a fair price...fresh chopped veggies...no limp-ass tomato discs that you see with most fast food chains...you get real fresh stuff here cooked to order..and again...Fries...order the fries."}
{"text":"Been here several times with friends and family, awesome menu selection and the food quality never disappoints! If you've never tried this place your missing out!"}
{"text":"They have the best French frys....I love their #8 anytime combo. 2pc fish, frys, salad and drink! :-)"}
{"text":"We drove by this place and decided to give it a try - so glad we did!  There are so many choices on the menu it made it hard to decide.  Different varieties of hamburgers, gyros, even Chicago style hot dogs.  We each got a cheeseburger and they were delcious!  Fries were good, too.  Being from the midwest, I loved all the Chicago memorabilia they had in the restaurant.  The guy who took our order (owner, perhaps) was very friendly and the place was clean - even the bathrooms which is a major rating factor with me.  They even had a tv in there with the news on which was pretty cool.  If we lived closer, we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"Burger Mania is pretty damn good. I've been staying at the Motel 6 next door, so I've been frequenting Burger Mania quite often over the past two days. Long story short, I've been consuming some pretty decent burritos lately.

I know this place serves everything from burgers to gyros, but it really gave me the impression of a fast food Tex-Mex restaurant. That isn't a bad thing by any means; it did the Tex-Mex thing very well, and I was thoroughly pleased. But for the purpose of this review, I'll be focusing on the Tex-Mex aspect of Burger Mania.One note on the name though, they really should serve a veggie burger. I find it manic that a veggie burger is not on Burger Mania's large and diverse menu.

So far I've tried the Vegetarian Burrito, the Breakfast Veggie Burrito and the Bean and Cheese Burrito. The Vegetarian Burrito was great. It was loaded with avocado and other goodies. I also enjoyed the Breakfast Veggie Burrito, as it had all the vegetarian breakfast staples I enjoy (including eggs). I also found it nice that they let me choose from the breakfast menu despite it being noon and the sign saying breakfast ends at 11am. That was very kind of them. Both burritos were decently priced, though you can get more for your money elsewhere. I'd say it's a good value all things considered.

The Bean and Cheese burrito sucked. It was just like the name implied: nothing but beans and cheese and it was very bland. Yucky. But at least it's large and cheap, so you get your money's worth. If you really want to save a buck, then there ya go I guess.

Also, a shoutout to the Horchata: it's on point. A fine beverage.

Pro-tip: Don't get the typical pre-bottled hot sauces that are sitting next to the ketchup directly in front of the register. Instead, opt for the homemade sauces that are off to the side. If you're facing the register, they're on the left. The homemade sauces are much better.

Speaking of the homemade sauces, you have a choice between the green sauce and the red sauce and some other fixings. I recommend the green (verde) sauce. It has a small kick and it's very tasty. I also want to give Burger Mania props for including convenient to-go containers with lids for sauces. This way, I can take them back to the Motel 6 and try to forget the fact that I'm staying at a Motel 6. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful. The service is a tad on the slow side, but it's not unbearable by any means. The wait is definitely worth it though.

And of course, I need to talk about the beverage options. You have alot. Like seriously, I don't think I've ever seen this many. Fountain soda, bottled water, lemonade, HORCHATA, cheap beer, decent beer, soda in freaking glass bottles, the list goes on. I think they even serve spirits (vodka, rum) in those small one-shot glass containers. You will not be disappointed with your options. Good job Burger Mania, you have mastered the beverage game.

Okay, I've said all that needs to be said, so now it's time to give Burger Mania a rating. This is a tough one. It's a toss up between 4 and 5 stars. Like, it's very close. Unfortunately though, I have a policy that if I have to question whether or not to give a place 4 or 5 stars, it gets 4 stars. I only give a 5 star review if the establishment absolutely and undeniably earned it. So Burger Mania gets 4 stars.

Why does Burger Mania get only 4 stars? It ultimately comes down to value. Let's compare Burger Mania to other Tex-Mex establishments. At Taco Bell, I can get more for my money. And at Chipotle, I can get a better product for my money. So while Burger Mania is very, very good, it's just a little short of 5-star good. I can honestly say that Burger Mania, for me, is probably the closest an establishment has come to getting 5 stars without getting 5 stars. If I could do 4.5 stars, I absolutely would. So don't let this 4 star rating hold you back; Burger Mania is damn good.

Bottom line: I can recommend Burger Mania. If you're in the area and you're looking for a solid eatery, Burger Mania is a good choice. They have something for everyone, and they do a pretty decent job. It's definitely worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! Great Burgers, Great fries, and they serve Alcohol, I was not drinking this time! Only reason not 5 stars is because I spent $12.00, but its worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Burger patties are thin thin thin. Homeless people in here brushing teeth in dinner. Only upside was the fries were good. Burger didn't take long but it was paper thin so it shouldn't have. Tables dirty. Bathroom dirty. This was when there wasn't many customers either.much to be said for a burger place that sells more of everything other than burgers and has a display to sell gallons of liquor."}
{"text":"Italian Beef was horrible. But the Philly Steak was awesome. It was a little greasy, but was worth going back. I'm from Chicago and it is hard to find anything close. Burger Mania says Chicago Style but they don't have mild sauce. They should look into that."}
{"text":"Burger mania was delicious my kids and I loved the food and the restaurant. My son got a grilled cheese which he liked and I got the burger special and they remind me of the burgers I ate as a kid in California. We will be back here in the near future."}
{"text":"The food was okay, i got the reuben last year 2016. Didnt come on rye and it was smothered in mustard. Like so much it was inedible"}
{"text":"First time ordering thru Grubhub for this place. Pleasantly surprised how good and fast the service was. We ordered the burgers, cheese cake, and quesadilla. All very good. We will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Don't like to give places 5 stars unless they earn it, but I loved coming here. Relaxed, clean, friendly ambiance. I ordered the bacon burger and it was exactly what I expected. A thin grilled patty, crispy fresh bacon, not too much sauce. My wife got a Gyro. 3.75, but her complaints were not enough veggies and sauce. It wasn't greasy, had great flavor, and was hot as hell! She had a hard time holding it when it first came to her, it was so fresh. Will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is very good!I had the gyros special and it was very good! Good atmosphere and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 8 years and have never had mediocre food. It's always fresh and piping hot. This is one of the best kept secrets in N Phoenix!"}
{"text":"GREAT FRIES!! AMAZING BURGERS!! AND I LOVE THE HORCHATA idk what some people are talking about?? It's not over priced, average pricing 5.99 for a bacon avocado double patty cheeseburger, pretty fast service, clean inside! My first time here and I love it, they have everything here! I would highly recommend them to people always looking for new places to try out they sell liquor and beers too we out here gettin turnt eating burgers"}
{"text":"I hadn't stopped here to eat in quite a long time. I remembered they had great burgers and the french fries were a very good grade of potato and had great taste. I went through the drive up to pick up my order and as usual they are very friendly and customer service oriented....... my complaint is they have now gone to a new french fry. They are like those mashed potato preformed fries, they used to have a good size think hamburger with great taste and now it's the small flattened out patty....... I was sure disappointed in my meal from the last time I ate here.. Not sure why eating places have a good thing going and they go and change up the food for lower grade food............ I don't think I will be back. The reason I went there in the past was because of their food now that reason is gone................

{"text":"$7 teriyaki Swiss burger was so delicious! I like a burger on the thinner side and this was but man was it packed with flavor and it was juicy. My husband got the standard Mania burger and it was also juicy but after trying my burger I caught him longingly looking over eyeing mine haha. I've been here before but it's been a while...not good on the waistline but yum! The place itself is run down a bit but they sure make it interesting with food and drink options. If you haven't been, I suggest the trip."}
{"text":"I loved the fries and the gyro wasn't as salty and greasy as other places I've had. I would definitely go during the day though. The place is kinda depressing...."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and not worth it. They dont explain anything to you or offer receipts. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Love the selection here! Seriously over 100 different food choices. Atmosphere is awesome, an old school theme. Great customer service. And food is good quality! Definitely a go to spot. Wish there were more in the valley!"}
{"text":"This place is surrounded by car dealerships and the closest other \"business\" is a place where people who got in trouble by Johnny Law have to talk to counselors about why they got in trouble in order to appease the court and have their crime forgiven.  Anyway, that's just kind of setting the scene for this place and its surroundings.

Burger Mania is just sort of depressing.  It has weird decorations, like this Uncanny Valley hot dog statue that is covering itself in mustard and ketchup and looking right into your eyes, begging to be eaten so that it can end its miserable life.  It wants the sweet, sweet release of death so badly.  For some reason, below the neon sign reading \"Burger Mania\" with burnt out letters, there's these weird, I don't know, mascots, one of which is a dinosaur.  

All that said, the food is actually pretty good.  It was kind of amazing!  It's nothing extraordinary, no, not by any means... and if you're expecting that from a place called Burger Mania, god help you... but, grading on a curve, they deserve four stars.  Given all the places that look as depressing as this one, hardly any of them actually deliver on any sort of promise to actually have good food.  This one does.  And it's pretty inexpensive."}
{"text":"Burger Mania, huh?? I had 2 people tell me, that this place is great, but by the looks of the location we just weren't sure. Looked kind of low end. But boy was I surprised!! The interior is arcade/restaurant/Chicago Sports fan mish mash. I am from IL originally (frequenting Chicago often) and I loved looking at all the Chicago-type decor on the walls. The guy at the counter (originally from Chicago), was a delight to chat with as we talked about the Bears. It was a fun, inviting environment. Now to the food. One word \"DELISH\". I really enjoyed the chicken gyro. It had nice lean cuts of chicken (seasoned very well I might add), dressed in euro-type sauce, lettuce, onions, all nestled in a tastey warm pita. The fries were great too! Good cuts of potatoes, not skimpy or anything you might find at other fast food joints. My husband had the regular gyro and he thought it was a good portion and tasted good as well (although he had a bite of my chicken gyro and he thought mine would be what he would get next time). Two thumbs up.

As far as the burgers (didn't even try at 'Burger' Mania). But I'm sure we will return and try those out as well. Plus, there are so many other options here to choose from, I'm sure we will be back to try several. Good place to go if you are hungry, and love Chicago! :o)

Only downside is that you have to do a u-turn if you are heading eastbound on Bell rd. because there's a medium in the road. But no big , its worth the quick  turn of the wheel."}
{"text":"This place is crazy, strangest menu in the world and the strangest decor ever.

The food is kind of WTF, but overall pretty good.

Hats off to whoever is running this place because this person is afraid of nothing! Antything and everything goes here so prepare for it all."}
{"text":"This is a FUN budget eatery that offers a variety of different foods and some adult booze in airplane bottles and beer. They offer, burgers, Chicago Sandwiches and hot dogs, breakfast sandwiches, Gyros, Mexican Food and MORE!

I tried a pastrami topped single burger with fries. The burger is unique. It's a fresh made squashed thin on the grill kind of burger. The pastrami accented the beef well and gave it more flavor. I liked that this isn't a really big burger. It's fast food sized and priced and MUCH BETTER than a fast food burger. The fries were very fresh and crisp and seemed to be lightly battered.

My husband had the Ortega burger that had a roasted green chili and sautéed onions with onion rings. They have a sign stating the onion rings are home made. The onions were very similar to burger king onions rings but better.

Better than Fast Food and only Fast Food Priced.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Disappointed 

I hear only good thing about Burger Mania and thought it's about time I try this place.  Unfortunately, I have to say that the food on this visit wasn't  good.

The burgers at Burger Mania are exceptionally bland.  To be honest initially, when I unwrapped my burger and took the first bite I thought there wasn't a patty on the bun. When I pulled the top of the bun off I saw a very small thin patty covered in condimemts.  The burger had so many condiments it made the bun soggy and it fell apart.  The fries at Burger Mania were crispy and hot however, the fries had an odd tasting seasoning and just weren't very good.

On a positive note the service at Burger Mania is fast and the prices are on the low end.  However, if you are looking for a tasty traditional  burger or would like to enjoy a burger  with a twist, I would forgo Burger Mania."}
{"text":"Great little all around burger stop. Great hotdogs burgers and Italian beef. They are across the street from my office, but often make the drive on Saturday just for lunch."}
{"text":"Good Gyro sandwich and the pricing was also reasonable. Paid under $25 for myself and two kids. Pretty good for a quick stop."}
{"text":"A taste of back home, so many menu choices, and there's a drive thru!

They have old school arcade games inside, too.

Friendly staff.

Gyros and fries are good,  philly cheese steak is really good especially since there's a lack of that in AZ, burgers are good (they are the thin patties though), chicken sandwiches are good, and they offer plenty of beverage selections.

I also love the parking lot, because there are so many pot holes, you definitely think you're back in Chicago! ;)

Above anything else, it's 189083 times better than the McDonald's down the street."}
{"text":"Looking for the best, greasy burger in PHX? Go there!   The burgers are perfect and the tacos are even better"}
{"text":"I rarely post on Yelp but I really thought this place deserved more stars than it currently has! They have a really great atmosphere going and good food! Everyone in the restaurant seems to be saying great things about their food and the service was really friendly! Great place for a great burger and a great place to bring the family!"}
{"text":"I still wish they had better burgers. Don't get me wrong but I like a fat thick hand pattied burger not a normal thin one. 

I usually get the gyro and have never been disappointed. They are good. They are stuffed with gyro meat! 

The staff has ALWAYS been great. The store is ALWAYS clean."}
{"text":"Great food.  Cozy feel to the place.  Great for a family to eat and share good times."}
{"text":"Very clean and well kept inside. You can tell the owners and staff care about their place. The food was outstanding! The owner is from Chicago so you know he understands Windy City fare!

I loved the Chicago dogs and hamburgers! Recommend to all that want a great meal without breaking the bank! Beats the big box burger boys any day!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers and great value. The double Mania burger is the standard and is very tasty. The avocado bacon burger is actually amazing, with plenty of both! The gyro is tasty too but could be a little more plentiful, but for $5 with fries and drink included it just can't be beat.

The beverage bar features Tang which I didn't think was a big deal until I had three glasses! Nostalgia or thirst, I'm not sure. But it was obviously a real hit with me!

The decor is reminiscent of the 50s but could use a refresh to come off less dingy. It actually comes off a little more like an amusement park, which is kind of fun, but still in need of some new carpeting and paint. Not a reason not to go there though."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Best Gyros, hot dogs and their home made zucchini are amazing! Not one speck of grease on anything! It looks scary on the outside but it is very clean and well taken care of!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time while looking for a car when I first moved to Phoenix about 5 years ago. I love this place reminds of the Midwest! Not that the food is anything great but that's what makes it good just a simple burger place that you can take your kids to to enjoy themselves and to get a little flashback of your childhood! I come back every so often for a double bacon cheeseburger and I can't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"You would think because of the variety available the quality might suffer but you would be DEAD WRONG. I had the gyro plate with saffron rice and a Greek salad. It was perfect and on par with anything you would get at a more expensive restaurant. They also have great deals on beer! I would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"This place kinda freaked me out at first,l. Looked like a stechy wanna be mcdonalds that server gyros. I ate a burger from there and it was pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Ground beef, beans, cheese, sour cream burrito is what I unfortunately ordered. What I received was salty soup wrapped in a paper thin flour tortilla. The burrito filling was literally watery, soup beef sauce soup with bean soup with watery sour cream. The burrito was loosely wrapped (can't wrap soup tightly). This \"burrito\" had NO flavor, but salt. Lots and lots of salt. How they even thought this \"food\" was acceptable is beyond me. I will NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwich outstanding in the burgers were great I recommend the pastrami sandwiches all day"}
{"text":"Holy crow their burger and fries are huge. I felt like I was eating fries for days. I eventually gave up and still had a bunch left over.  Very tasty and beats a chain fast food burger and fries."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place to get a Philly Cheese Steak in Arizona!!! The owner is awesome! Has been really nice and accommodating every time I have gone there! I bought my car across the street at Midway Nissan and visit Burger Mania every time I get it serviced. This last time, I finally got to take my boyfriend and son with me, instead of bringing the food home to them! My boyfriend stated, \"Wow, it was good before, but definitely better hot!\" (Just so happened that the time I took my son with me, he got to take a picture with Mickey Mouse!!! He was thrilled!) We travel to Bell Rd for them (and Midway Nissan) from Tempe! Well worth it!"}
{"text":"I ordered from uber eats and the customizability is amazing. The burgers are good so we're the onion rings. and the salad was fresh! loves it. reason I put 4 stars is because I thought the burgers would be jucier with all the hype of the \"fresh patty\" that was on the description. but still pretty good."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheeseburger, a chicken sand which and a lg cheese fry. It came out to $16. When I go and pick it up and all ready pay the guy asks me what would I like to drink. Wtf! I ordered 2 sandwiches and a fry not 2 meals. I payed for more than I wanted, don't wanted drinks, so instead of refunding the money for the meals I did not ordered they just give me 2 large fry,s and one little thing of cheese that cost a dollar. I tried this place cuz it's closer than Wendy's. For now on I'm going to drive the extra mile to get Wendy's or something."}
{"text":"Awesome chili burger!  Chili is home made too!!
They have minor bottles of liquor and bottled beer. Free refills on sodas. Service was quick and reasonably priced.  They have a drive through too. Kind of a funky deal to have booze and a drive thru.  I approve!!!"}
{"text":"Strange place, very tasty. They have a little bit of everything: burgers, fries (surprisingly delicious), gyros, tacos, salads, hot dogs, corn dogs, Philly Cheesesteak...and the menu goes on and on. Most places that try to do a little bit of everything end up not doing anything really well. This place does. 

The gyro was better than one I had last week at an actual Greek restaurant; the cheeseburger was a little lacking in the meat dept but very tasty. My son had a corn dog - loved it, and my husband had the Philly Cheesesteak and said it was as good as any he's had - even better than some actual Philly Cheesesteak places. And the fries. I'll go back just for the fries alone. And very friendly service to boot. 

I say it's \"strange\" bc it looks like it wants to be a McDonalds or some other fast food burger joint but it kicks all fast food places I've ever been - and they serve Starbucks and beer. Right there should be 'nuff said. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"The bf has been dieing for me to try this place.  Finally stopped today and it was legit.

So many combos of food. Chicago hot dogs, hamburgers, gyros, pastrami, breakfast and mexican food? Sure, why not? 

We kept it simple with cheese burgers, fries and sodas. Oh and Tang. The tang was pretty good. They also have real cane sugar sodas."}
{"text":"I saw the place several years ago and never gave it a thought.  I was in the area last week and decided what the heck, I may as well try it.  I ordered the Burger Mania combo with fries and a drink.  I was very surprised how good the burger was and the French fries were nice and crispy, just like I like them.  My only regret was not getting a double patty.  The single is a little thin but still very good.  I don't eat burgers too often but this place is now on my radar and I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious fries and an awesome burger. I love the thousand island on the burger. The bun had a little sweatness too. They made all of my food fresh to order too."}
{"text":"Disappointed, disappointed, disappointed. The beer was cold and good though! We originally went in for the tacos but when I found out they have store bought hard shell tacos and just stuffed them I changed my mind. My husband and I ordered the chicken sandwich since the picture looked enticing. To our disappointment the chicken was not battered and was manufactured, one can tell it came from a store bought frozen bag of chicken patties. Very disappointed. Customer service was not good at all, I stood there almost six minutes. My husband came in and said, \"What did you order? I said, \"Nothing, I haven't got a \"hello\" and wouldn't you know it, the cook turned around and said \"hello\". When the actual cashier finally came up, it was a little less than ordering from a computer. The fries were okay not as hot and fresh as I like and the chicken sandwich was disanointing. Even the Jr. hot dog looked like something I can make at home. Too bad, we will not be back, they had really good cold beer $3 for international brand I'll give them that but heck, I can get that in my own bar in the garage for the same price."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have lived in the neighborhood for 2 years and have yet to try this fine establishment. We ordered the Gyro,  bacon cheeseburger and carne asada burrito. It did take a quite a bit longer than I anticipated before out food was ready even though I had ordered from the drive-thru but the wait was well worth it. All of our food was piping hot so we knew it was freshly made. Let me say that the bacon cheeseburger is how every bacon cheeseburger should be made. Thick beef patties with freshly cooked crispy bacon. The gyros were very delicious and seasoned to perfection. The carne asada burrito was the only flaw from our order. The meat looked to be like the same thinly slices of beef they used for the gyros just seasoned differently and they put way too much onions. There was like a bite or 2 I felt I wasn't eating a carne burrito but an onion one. Also the salsa here is no joke. If you want 'REAL' spicy salsa than this the place to go. Overall the food is fine quality over here. Don't judge this place from the looks of it because it's a diamond in the rough. You'll be glad that you tried it."}
{"text":"Won't be going back.  Big menu, bigger prices for sub par food.   Total price on a meal for me and my daughter at 22.00.  Splurged on a bean and cheese burrito at 5.50, tasted like store bought canned beans.  Way over priced and the food frankly wasn't very good."}
{"text":"went today for lunch, they guy at the counter was not friendly didnt even great us with a hello. I have eaten here before but today will be my last day as I sat down to enjoy my burger 4th bite into it and there was a LONG hair in it. I went up and showed them and he apologized but he only would offer me something else. Now why would I want something else after pulling a hair out of my mouth. Asked for a refund and would not do it. So watch out for them hairs!"}
{"text":"It took me a long time to try this place given that its exterior screamed \"Yuk!\".  I'm glad I did!  I heard they had a decent Italian beef sandwich.  Since I was trying to find a good one in the area I thought I would give it a shot.  

Good thing I did.  They really load on the beef.  They also include free (by request) au jus AND a freshly made jalapeno/diced carrot/celery spicy topping that is a must.  The quality of the beef is very high.  All lean, no big chunks of fat anywhere (for the most part) and great flavor.  THE BREAD - At other places the bread falls apart before you even take a bite.  I don't know what kind of bread Burger Mania uses but it stays solid until the last bite!  It won't disintegrate in your hands.  I thought that was awesome.  

TRY THE ITALIAN BEEF SANDWICH!  

the end."}
{"text":"Pretty simple review.  Everything I've ordered here has been fantastic.  Last order was their pastrami burger.  Today good old bacon cheese burger but you can't go wrong no matter what you try"}
{"text":"Any homesick Cubs or Sox fans will appreciate this Chicago-style burger, dog and gyro joint.  Also features Italian beef sandwiches and good fries.  Pepsi.  No coke."}
{"text":"Despite being called Burger Mania, try the Gyro. The burgers are nothing interesting and, in fact, are bordering on being worse than a place like McDonald's or Burger King. Even the onion rings, which are said to be homemade, were nothing special. However, the gyro is excellent. Burger Mania does the gyro right by using a vertical rotisserie cooking the meat instead of frying pre-sliced stuff on the grill or even, heaven forbid, microwaving it like some other places do. They also load the gyro up full without skimping. The place would be more accurately named Gyro Mania."}
{"text":"Having read the reviews prior to going, I steered clear of any burgers....
but decided on a Chicago hot dog....other than a poppy seed bun there is NOTHING Chicago about this hot dog...in fact...it tastes exactly the same as the $1.50 hot dog you get at Sams Club or Costco!....not bad...but definately nothing special...
The fries arent aweful...but not my taste....
The best part of the lunch was the brewed iced tea which was good.

If you want a great burger....got to Five Guys Burgers...if you want a good Chicago dog go anywhere but here.

I would have ordered the Italian Beef which had good reviews...but I prefer a \"Cheesy beef\"  If you are from Chicago you know what I mean...however they did not have mozzerella cheese...only swiss?  So I nixed the beef idea...

Will I be back....Absolutely NO!!"}
{"text":"Old Wendy's building, taken over. Anyway, their gyros taste good. Having a drive through and specials is a plus. Fries could use some changing though, those crinkle cut frozen kind  taste old. The Chicago hot dog is amazing though. Haven't tried the burger here, but husband has and he said it was ok."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I wasn't sure when I saw it but my husband and I both loved what we ordered. He got the pastrami melt and raved about it and I got the biggest breakfast burrito ever. Definately a place we will go to again!"}
{"text":"The ladies from work wanted to eat here the other day so I agreed to go with. I wanted to like this place, I really did. It has a selection of food to please most. Burgers, hot dogs, gyros, and some Mexican food too. Very eclectic on the inside. Kind of a mish-mash. I ordered a burger combo and asked for no bun, telling the order taker I had my own bun (yes crazy, I know but I'm gluten free and so few places offer a bun for me). When my order was ready, they had not only wrapped my burger in lettuce, which I did not ask for, but they had cut it in half, also not requested. This made putting the burger on my bun a challenge but I managed. I am sure they were trying to accommodate me and be helpful, maybe the order taker did not understand I had my own bun. The fries were pretty decent. I had horchata to drink and it was really good."}
{"text":"If you are craving a Swanson's frozen dinner or maybe a tour of the freezer section from the grocery store...man are you in luck! I'm willing to bet the only fresh item they have in the store is lettuce and tomato. Their onion rings don't even have onion in them. It's onion flavored dough. How tight are your profit margins that can't use real onions? 

And then....and then!

Milkshakes are just powdered milk product thats kind of sort of chilled to an almost frozen temp. Mmm.

Wings! They were the worst I've ever had. Mushy and flavorless. Look, I'm not a chef. How do you screw up deep fried wings with Franks hot sauce? I don't know, but somehow they did. They screwed it up famously. 

Fish and Chips. Van de Kamp's or Gorton's. I'll bet my damn mortgage on it. 

Unbelievably bad food all the way around. We threw away most of it. If you're looking to punish yourself and your wallet, this is your place."}
{"text":"Overpriced Overpriced Overpriced Overpriced.. this place is ridiculously priced regular size = large ??? WTH ... I don't get this joint and it is in the hood so buyer beware homeless people and hookers .... Boom"}
{"text":"This place is a good Chicago diner.  Gyros and Chicago dogs are very good, burgers are good, pastrami is OK. The service is always great and with a smile. You have to make a u-turn to get to it if you are coming east from the 17fwy. It's fair priced and tasty, worth a try."}
{"text":"This visit I used a debit card and was charged a..50 debit fee. This is a pretty steep fee compared to what processors charge restaurants. There was not a sign giving notification of.the fee. I have to remove a star."}
{"text":"I went today for lunch and was happy I went.  I had the Double Ortega burger with green chili's, grilled onions, and thousand island.  The fries could have been a bit more well done to my liking but were ok.  

I really wish I had some quarters cause they had some classic arcade games like the original Galaga and an old NFL Blitz.  Overall good place as long as you can get past the look of the building from the outside."}
{"text":"This is the exact same food from the exact same people who brought us the fine 7foot tall, tube sock and sneaker wearing, weiner squirting ketchup onto himself at Mr Gyros  http://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-gyros-glendale#hrid:vNtdB1l_gwBMZ4slKfrGBQ

They're both solid 3.5 stars, serving Chicago style dogs, falafel and gyros, italian beef, and other assorted fast food.   Mr Gyros gets 3 and so BurgerMania gets a 4, maybe for nostalgia at eating at this building in its previous incarnation as a Wendy's all through high school.

I've only had the gyros and fries, both really good, with HUGE portions.
I trust DarenC though, who has tried it all, and liked it all but the burgers -- but with the Pastrami-Burger getting a special mention, I had to put it on my list for next time.   (Ironic, with the name, but these guys aren't really specializing in burgers, making the alternate name \"GyroMania\" suggested by the previous yelper a great idea)

Friendly owner or his son will chat you up if you like;  I found the matriarch of the family who served me at Mr Gyros a bit more reserved, but still cordial.  They also run the Mr Gyros II up in Anthem.

So nevermind the Bell Rd car-dealerships, Motel6, Waffle House, and other nearby neighbors (the lady with the short skirt doesn't really want to 'date' you) and pop into BurgerMania for a little of everything."}
{"text":"This place is a trip.  First off it's got a rainbow colored sign that stands out in a sea of car dealerships and strip malls on bell road.  It used to be a Wendy's, so the building has that curved window at the end.  On the plus side, they do have a drive thru. The inside is interesting because they have video games.  Not many fast food burger places have video games.  And these are state of the art video games.... from 1987.  The burger itself was okay.  Kind of small for the price.  Fries were decent.  Nothing special, but hot, fresh and thick cut fries.  I would like to try the gyro or hot dog, I bet those are better than the burgers."}
{"text":"It's great to know there are still real hamburger places to go. This place food is really good. Fresh made with real food and not pink slime. The taste is what you expect when you bite into a real juicy burger made the way you want. Recommend this place to anyone who wants real good burgers. There is a wide variety of food on menu, enough choices for whole family!"}
{"text":"Everyone I take here is skeptical, so I have to elaborate on the wide variety of items that are all very good.  The burgers are fresh, and they LOOK LIKE the photos that fast food joints use as their ads but never look as good. These look and taste delicious.

They have ala carte and combos. Some items include gyros, salads, burgers, breakfast (mornings), hot dogs, red hot dogs, fries, tacos and other Mexican food, pastrami and other sandwiches, and so on.

They have a ton of sauces available, and a Mexican pepper/salsa bar.

They have all you can drink self-serve soda.  

I think he's the owner, but the cashier man with the mustache is very friendly.  The place is apparently very Chicago themed. There's a cool bench seat made out of a truck tailgate.  The seating is spaced well (not packed like sardines), and the air conditioning was working great today. Part of the place is green-house style with see through windows on top, so if you're cold, you can sit there to warm in the sun like a cat.

The food was cooked quickly and didn't seem microwaved like most burger fast food.  The toppings were fresh (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, etc.).

There used to be video games here, but now it's just a couple of claw games, one for trinkets and one for stuffed animals.  There are also those slot machine toy dispensers for a quarter or so.

This place has been around for years. When it first opened, I gave it a year. But, I think the location is very good, around industrial work places, car repair shops, dealerships, etc. so they likely get a lot of food traffic there.

Would recommend this place. Something for everyone, and all has been good to date."}
{"text":"Awesome little shoppe with tasty food! I have been eating here for 3 years and am never disappoint."}
{"text":"A really great place in a horrible neighbor hood! That is the end of the story here. 

They run off loiters and hookers on a regular basis and serve up great food that is always really fucking good. Believe me when I tell you that this drive-thru will be your favorite stoner food place after your first stop. Try the burgers..no wait...the gyros are great...the teriyaki burger will make you crazy. 

They aren't open on Sundays, and I did get a drink from there that was more than a little \"off\". 

The storefront will not be enjoyed by the colorblind and smacks of a carnival barker's sex room. But I really like this place for what it is and isn't. 

Want a burger that is made with love and care? This is your place! The food is good enough to get 5 stars out of me. 

Remember that this is a RED DOT HIGH CRIME AREA (check out the crime map for Phoenix and this is one of the highest crime areas in the city) so bring your sidearm and you will make it out;."}
{"text":"4 for the food if you enjoy the occasional greasy burger and great fries. The gyros are  pretty decent too. Pretty good priced because the portions are pretty good. They used to run mr.gyros on 35th and bell i think because its virtually the same menu"}
{"text":"Really just a cheap crappy burger joint with nothing special. They have a ton of options but nothing worth getting.  

Burger had no flavor, was dry and covered in condiments to try and hide it. Chicken nuggets looked like they were the kind you buy in Costco and throw in the oven for your 12 year old's playdate. Onion rings were fake. Not real onion rings but the kind that are made of formed mashed onions, so they just taste like onion flavored mushy breading.  

I don't think I've ever had a more complete waste of money at a restaurant before."}
{"text":"This place serves everything under the sun, which means they don't specialized in one thing, which means nothing is above decent... I would recommend find another place.."}
{"text":"Food is ok for the price but they charge additional money for using the card meaning they do not want the patrons to use a card. The cost to use card is less than 1 percent of your total bill so I am a little baffled as to why they do not want people to use cards. Be sure you ask for a receipt with the food details and not just the card receipt."}
