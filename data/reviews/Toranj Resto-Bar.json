{"text":"the owner is very friendly and knows how to treat customers well. not too busy pub on the weekday so i sometimes visit here to have a drink by myseld"}
{"text":"Look close because the lower case J tends to visually resolve as an I. But it's not Torani. It's Toranj. Not sure why a perfectly good five letter word needs a weirdo J hanging off its ass end. But it is what it is. Toranj is an intimate little neighborhood pub just far enough west of Yonge/Finch that you might never notice it. 

It's also a mildly themed Persian shisha bar unmolested by a hipster crowd. You pretty much get Iranians local to the North York Iranian community in this place.

Toranj has an impressive list of appetizers for $3.99 (nachos, calamari, etc.) . This ain't no price jacked up pub found in the Entertainment district like The Ballroom. 

Service is quick and friendly. 

I think bud light is on tap and the only beer on tap. But there's a good bottle selection."}

Toranj Resto-Bar is dark and dim inside... dark walls, rich coloured curtains, dim lighting......

For me I think Toranj has an identity crisis.. it is not really a Resto? since they serving Pub food.. don't you feel sexy eating Nachos for $3.99?? The drinks menu though extensive but the drink Purple Haze ($8) I have though looked pretty was really weak. Only 1 beer on tap? 

The seating was a little not sexy nor comfy.. at least where we were sitting? wooden tables with wooden bar stools? And TV showing soccer games?

Sheesha ($15) is offered here that's the only hint that I know this is a Persian Hookah place....

The waitress here was super attentive.. kept asking if more drinks were needed... too attentive!"}
