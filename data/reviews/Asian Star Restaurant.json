{"text":"Always eat here with my family whenever we feel lazy cooking haha! Great staff!  & their sushis are good but they removed it for a while cos of winter season they said. It's about getting fresh fish and stuff. I miss their sushi tho"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area hands down. I've been going since it opened. Benson and his sister are great hosts and truly aim to please. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Noticed this place had recently opened up near the Dufferin and Eglinton Ave. West area. Looked presentable from the outside (especially compared to most businesses in the area) and once inside, I thought was decent. There was a good amount of tables, however it seemed really empty in the middle of the place. The server was very attentive and helpful. The food was very delicious, my girlfriend ordered the fried rice noodle with beef and her brother and myself ordered some pad thai. Plus we ordered some calamari and spice bean curds and the total was still under $40 for all three of us. A win in my book. I am definitely going to return here for another meal."}
{"text":"I love this place!!

I've ordered online several times, and in each occasion, I've gotten really fresh food. 

The quality of the vegetables is awesome. The mushrooms are so juicy and meaty, that are an example of how vegetables should be cooked.

I just would like to ask something to the owner: please use recyclable materials for food delivery (the carton boxes are cute). It breaks my heart to know how long is it going to take, for those containers to reintegrate....

Will give 5 stars if you go green.

Regards,"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Love the fact that they have delivery service.  I've been to the restaurant three times and I've ordered online twice.  The quality of food was the same for both and the service in house was really good."}
