{"text":"any time i am on the road and see a place that has been on DDD I stop. 
CRISPY CHICKEN Thats all I have to say!"}
{"text":"This place is straight FIRE.. the bar b que chicken is what makes this place so great.  fried chicken dipped in bbq sauce after, how could you not like that? family run joint on the west side of town, definitely would recommend stopping by on your way to or from the CLT airport. Cheers"}
{"text":"We ate inside and dave gives us star treatment. It was a lot of food but every bite was delicious. One of my favorites is the hush puppies."}
{"text":"Amazing, that's all I can say!!! No, wait...delicious, tasty, friendly, fun, unbelievable! If you haven't been, definitely check it out. The BBQ chicken is great!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on diners, drive-ins and dives over a year ago and I have really been looking forward to it. Well -it was GREAT!!!  I had the BBQ chicken and sliced pork sandwich. The chicken was perfect. Plump, juicy and the sauce was awesome. The sandwich had a wonderful smoked flavor and meet was tender and cooked to perfection. The charm was eating in the car and using the 50 year old speaker system to order. I didn't understand a  word the order taker said, but it didn't matter. I recommend you try this. It exceeded my very high exceptions."}
{"text":"All hype. Average food. I ordered the Minced Pork sandwich. It was served luke warm, lacked flavor and was served on a soggy bun. I really wanted to like this place especially after seeing it on Drive-Ins, Diners and Dives but instead I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Drove by this place a bunch of times heading back to the airport in Charlotte and today had some time and decided to give it a try.  Old school drive-in type service and only take cash (there's an ATM inside).  I had the BBQ Chicken which is essentially fried chicken dipped in BBQ sauce.  It was awesome....vinegar-based sauce and the meat was super moist and tender.  They serve fries and coleslaw with it...but you don't need to eat that - just focus on the chicken!  Will stop by again next time in town."}
{"text":"Looking at some of the other reviews, I'm surprised tipping became an issue.  Isn't it common to tip the person bringing you food?  Maybe it's just me.  Anyway, I'm lost living in New Jersey looking for good BBQ.  Since I was headed south for the holidays, I decided to look up the best BBQ spots in Charlotte.  Several came up in my search but I noticed that the BBQ King was on triple D and the best thing I ever ate.  So BBQ King it was and the plan was to try the BBQ chicken.

When we landed in Charlotte on a Sunday and they were closed.  So, on the return we gave ourselves a little time to check out the BBQ King.  It's an old school drive-in with an intercom ordering system.  I thought it was kind of cool.  What first struck me looking at the menu was the lack of BBQ items.  I saw burgers, steak, fried chicken and similar drive in type items.  But I didn't worry because I had a plan to try the BBQ chicken; and for good measure I choose the minced BBQ sandwich.

When the food came, I was surprised the BBQ chicken was fried chicken covered in BBQ sauce.  It then dawned on me that in the Carolinas BBQ is pork; like the minced sandwich I ordered.  Unfortunately, in my search for good BBQ, the BBQ King was not going to be my fix.  But I had to try the food.  I took a bite of the chicken and it was delicious.  The sauce was vinegary and the meat was moist and tender with a nice crunch.  I won't call it BBQ, but I will call it good!  They did a decent job with the pork sandwich but it didn't really taste smoked.  I put some coleslaw on it and it really made a nice sandwich.

Would I recommend BBQ King?  It was unique enough that with full disclosure yes.  Would I go back again?  Only if I was going with someone who had never been before.  As I said, I was on a search for good BBQ and the BBQ King doesn't really serve BBQ."}
{"text":"Food was awful, made my stomach hurt the rest of the day and my buddy threw up an hour after. Enough said."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the downhome feel of the place.. Really enjoyed the drinks.. Made the old-fashioned way. Food is always fresh and hot and flavorful. I was only disappointed once and that was a burger. The chicken is always good!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing meal that consisted of fried chicken (with homemade bbq sauce), pulled pork (aka bbq), homemade onion rings, homemade coleslaw, homemade hush puppies, and fresh brewed sweet tea.

First, let me tell you that the place is very unassuming. It's a old style southern drive in restaurant complete with metal trays and radios to call in your order. I explained it was my first visit so they sent a waiter out to show me the ropes. He explained what the platter combo was and, even though it was too much food for me, I wanted to get a \"tour\" so it was the way to go.

I had stepped out of my car to stretch my legs and was invited in to enjoy my feast. I gladly took them up on their offer as I'm not a fan of eating in cars. The staff was great. They wanted to make sure I was enjoying my meal and had whatever I needed. I also got to meet the owner and we spoke for a good 15 minutes. He told me that the recipe for their sauce has been the same for over 50 years and is made from scratch daily. When you taste it, you will get how important that is. Being from NJ (yes, I'm a Yankee) you hear about a Carolina bbq sauce and it being vinegar based. All I can say is any preconceived notions you have about this type of sauce... you're wrong. The sauce was fantastic and complimented pretty much everything on my plate. I was dipping onion rings and hush puppies in it. The fresh coleslaw had a sweet side to it that balanced it out. AND THE FRIED CHICKEN WAS THE BEST I HAVE EVER EATEN!!!  I am getting older and shouldn't be indulging in chicken skin, but I couldn't leave anything behind.

So in conclusion, the food, the people, the best."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Bar-B-Q-King approximately 5 or 6 times in the last year. I was first introduced to this location when I was doing research on restaurants visited by Food Network. The restaurant was featured on Diners, Drives, and Dives. The dish featured on the show was  the BBQ chicken. 

I decided to order the 1/4  BBQ chicken dinner plate. I decided to order french fries  as a side dish. The dish also comes with coleslaw (I do not like coleslaw, so I decided to get extra fries instead), and piece of bread. 

The restaurant is an old school set-up. The drive through still features a call in system from the 50's. The neighborhood the restaurant is located in is kinda sketchy. However, when you bite into that first piece of crunchy chicken with a twang of vinger, it will all be worth it. The chicken is especially crunchy and the sauce is delicious. The fries aren't really anything to write home about ( I prefer shoe-string fries), but with two piece of chicken I was so full it did not even matter.   

After my first experience I have been back about 5 times since January. The only problem I have with Bar-B-Q King is they only accept cash. Charlotte is the second largest bank system in the USA. However, I bank with a smaller bank and finding a teller near Wilkinson Blvd has become a challenge. So I can only eat there when I have cash. They do have a ATM machine located inside. However, I do not want to pay the additional $3.00 for a surcharge for using the ATM machine for $8.00 piece of chicken. 

If you have a $20.00 bill and a hungry appetite for Southern style BBQ this is definitely the place for you. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a vinger based BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Dude, I don't know about the other reviewer's but I'm a native Charlottean and I've came to this spot since I can remember, having grown up on the West Side. Simply put Bar- B - Q King has some of the best burgers and rings in the city and I've tried them all, Nothing like an Ol'School Drive In for the best on the West:-)"}
{"text":"i had the cherry lemon sun drop too and it was great. i had the 1/4 dunken chicken plate and onion rings. and my hubby had the minced meat sandwich. the chicken was the best fried chicken i have had but i dont normally like fried chicken. the onion rings were real crunchy but they dont make it as leftovers so if you dont finish them throw them away. they have no tables so you eat in your car. kinda like a sonic were you pull up and order. so dont wear nice clothes or bring the nice car to eat. they only take cash but have a atm back in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I live with in walking distance so I am a regular. Food is fine, nothing especially special. I enjoy your bbq chicken most, it's always very moist."}
{"text":"I give this a five star rating only for the chicken which was excellent quality and great sauce. The cole slaw was also very good. Though we didn't taste everything, the overall experience  was a 3.5"}
{"text":"After moving out of Charlotte, the BBQ King is one of the restaurants that I miss the most. First, its not really in a ghetto, but its definitely not the safest part of town. Second, its a drive-in, so you'll have to pull up and order through an intercom or walk inside and order. No indoor seating (usually folks just eat in their car or on the tailgate). Everything I've had there has been delicious, but where they excel is their barbecued fried chicken. Tender, moist, crispy, delicious fried chicken, that is submerged and soaked in their homemade westen Carolina style bbq sauce thats the perfect combination of savory and tangy. You'll need plenty of napkins and beverage while devouring this bird. Cash only, and be sure to tip the server! Closed on Sundays and Mondays too. Don't pass up a chance to eat here!"}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers we ventured here in large part because it was featured on DDD.

Pros: old time drive-in, lots of food for the $$$, chicken was really moist, good coleslaw & good sweet tea.

Cons: fries were the kind that if you don't get them right out of the fryer and salted, they will go limp quickly. As another reviewer described the sauce: it is a combo between bbq sauce and wing sauce - kinda bummed that it was not solid bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant was featured on triple D and figured we had to stop by on our way home from Spring Break.

As soon as we pulled in, David greeted us and told us about their famous dishes. We told him we were passing through and he immediately told us we had to get some pictures. He took a few for us and went above and beyond to make our visit special. His 15 years of experience showed and you could tell he loved every second he worked there.

Once we finished up with the pictures we went inside and placed our order for their combo that had everything Guy tried. We didn't want to eat in our car as we'd been driving for a while, so they set up a nice spot for us to eat in their quaint entryway. The food was incredible. Chicken was juicy. Hush puppies were the best I've had. Wasn't a huge fan of the onion rings (too bready), but they were by no means bad. Prices are comparable and we walked away full for under $40 for 3 of us with dessert.

This place deserves 6 out of 5 stars. The staff were friendly, food was great and the area was clean. Wish there would have been some tables outside to eat at, but it's a drive in, so if you want to eat outside you can eat by your car. 

Stop here for a great meal and awesome memories."}
{"text":"Classic American food in an old fashioned drive-in setting. Although I'm not a burger person, theirs was pretty tasty. I've eaten there a few times now and sometimes the food is better than other times... its hit or miss. 

Oh, and they stay open pretty late too. If you like this place, you must visit Zack's Hamburgers only 15 minutes away.

Con: They only accept cash. No debit/credit here!

Be sure to tip the guys that bring your food out the car!"}
{"text":"Bar-B-Q King
My son and I saw it on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, we've been waiting over a year to try it out. This place did not disappoint us, it was excellent the skin was crispy and the chicken was juicy.  See ya next time we are in Charlotte.
Thanks"}
{"text":"in the Ghetto? Really? I would hate to see what you think the real ghetto looks like. 

I had the minced bbq sandwich and regular onion rings (still a HUGE portion). The pork was moist and tasty with a subtle, just the right amount of slaw on top. The side of sauce made my day as it took it up a notch with just a little more kick from the vinegar base.

As others have said, leave the credit cards in the wallet, CASH ONLY here."}
{"text":"This place never fails! It's been a staple in my child and adulthood forever. Every time I come home. I get BarBQ King every time!!! The Minced BBQ sandwich and strawberry shake!!"}
{"text":"I don't know about the guy who posted the review. This place is very good for homemade burgers and I like the steak on a Kaizer - the owners are great and caters to your needs."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for these guys and it was decent but not great. It has a cool vibe based on the age and being an original drive-in for over 50 years. The menu is a mix of bbq and fried chicken, with a few sides and shakes too.

Eating in the car was easy as they bring a tray for each person individually. We had the fried chicken, fries, bbq (pork) sandwich and onion rings. The biggest complaint we had was that the chicken and bbq were both a little bland. The dark meat chicken was a little too dry but the breast was great. The sandwich was OK, pork was decent could've used a better bun, it fell apart, which is trouble eating in the car. Fries were fine, onion rings were nothing special and a little too greasy. Shakes are a perfect match for the food if you're considering it. Overall a cool place with average food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars? Who gave them that?

1. The service is so unique. I like to describe it as a \"sonic from WW2\". Same PA speaker as when it was built. It's a little hard to talk into but they'll come out if it's challenging 

2. Get their cherry limeaid soda. My oh my is this good

3. Most important. Get their sampler platter the BBQ pork is wonderful and the BBQ fried chicken is unbelievable. A combo could feed 2 people butttt who wants to share.  I like their hush puppies too! 

4. I can never photograph my food because we crush the food immediately. 

5. Attached is a photo of the sign at least"}
{"text":"The food was greasy. BBQ sauce wasn't good at all. I went to try out their restaurant because the food looked good on triple Ds. Turned out the food wasn't worth the drive"}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken was very tasty. The fries, cole slaw, and roll were not with the calories. Don't forget to bring cash as that is the only currency that is allowed. The service was excellent and very responsive."}
{"text":"For me, when it comes to BBQ Fried Chicken, I refuse to go anywhere but Bar-B-Q King. How they manage to make fried chicken soaked in bbq sauce stay crispy and not get soggy is beyond me but thats okay, as long as I get to eat it. 

After I first ate here, it took a lot of energy not to go back at least once a week. I cant have anyone come visit me without taking them there and I cant help but yell out \"BBQ King\" whenever anyone mentions their favorite bbq place. Its that good. 

While, Its sad that they are closed on Sundays and Mondays, whenever I head over there the place puts a smile on my face. Their old ordering system from when, I think, they first opened, is very old school and gives it a fun feeling. The servers are always smiling and seemingly happy. If 'diners drive-ins and dives' says its a good as I say, then you better make a trip over to try their chicken!"}
{"text":"Nasty nasty NASTEEEEE
We tried bbq platter. Pork was old borderline rancid, sauce was tasteless. Baked beans were canned. Hush puppies had no seasoning and fried onion rings were thick, also tasteless and over battered. Service was quick but awkward due to the person that brought the food just stood there waiting to be tipped......before we had a chance to taste the nastiness.
The sweet tea was good.....
I think DDD should revoke his spot the map.."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq fried chicken. Good little drive in spot that has been in Charlotte for years. Always have to stop by when im in the area. Was also on Diners Drive Inns and Dives."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are fantastic. The sauce is perfect. Potato salad was a little dry but I assume that's a southern style. I will be back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is a delicious place to eat. I really like the chicken filet sandwich as well as the Po Boy. The service is wonderful. 

Family owned and operated."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken. Best in Charlotte. Bring a bib---or turn your cape around."}
{"text":"Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said, the neighborhood is suspect.  Service was good and I liked the potato salad.  Baked beans were from the can.  Drive up was good and service was super fast."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of this place. Featured on DDD and it's been around for years. All four of us couldn't finish the food. The sauce they dipped the fried chicken in turned my stomach and I was not impressed with the pork. I don't get the point of taking crispy fried chicken and soaking it in a sauce to the point the fried skin is then soggy.  The hush puppies were the only thing I could eat. I hate leaving bad reviews but this place turned my stomach. I will say the service was good."}
{"text":"The BBQ fried chicken was probably the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. Juicy but not greasy, full of flavor, all around delicious. Four of us ordered individual meals, which is a ton of food, and the only thing that didn't get eaten was about 5 french fries. Highly recommend trying out this Charlotte restaurant icon."}
{"text":"The service here was outstanding! We pulled up and were quickly approached by our friendly server (is that what you call them in a drive in situation?). When we told him it was our first time there he quickly said that one of us will need to have the chicken and one should have the pork. Who are we to argue? We love chicken and pork! 

After just a few minutes wait the food appeared in our car and did not disappoint. My only complaint, there was too much of it. Since I was headed out of town I went in and got a box to send the leftovers home with the husband so that I knew he would have something to eat for dinner. 

The service inside was just as friendly as that which we received upon arrival and that alone is reason for me to hit this place up again next time I'm on my way to/from the airport."}
{"text":"An old Charlotte icon. One of the the original and few remaining car hop service. Gotta check this one off your 'old Charlotte originals' triple D's list."}
{"text":"This place was not so good. The onion on the burger was too strong and the burger did not taste good. The BBQ chicken was just ok. This place was old and I will definitely not be going back. Very disappointed with Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives (DDD) for recommending this place."}
{"text":"Came here after reading the reviews and had high high expectations for the BBQ fried chicken. It was good but not great. I would probably prefer the regular fried chicken as the meat was very tender and juicy. It's definitely a throw back place and very similar to South 21 here in Charlotte. Bring cash as they don't accept cards and this is a drive in so good is brought by car hop."}
{"text":"Having grown up in North Carolina, I've had lots of Barbecue (and I also smoke my own).  I feel I can adequately judge the quality of BBQ.  This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's.  I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal.  I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.  In addition I ordered a \"Minced\" barbecue sandwich, which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ.   

First let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared.  They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce.  I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy.  It was \"okay\" but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for.  

As for the barbecue, it is also \"okay;\" I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen).  In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue.  The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise."}
{"text":"Very  disappointed,  My family has been  a customer  for many years.  On a Saturday  right before  closing and I stopped in to purchase a  trout  dinner  with onion rings. The onion rings burned  and the  fish had  hair folic on it.  Couldn't  call back because  they had closed  and didn't  open back  up until  Tuesday.   I took  pictures  of the food because  I had to travel. I went in when I returned on Friday  and showed  the lady the food and she got really  nasty  with me.  Very  bad customer service.  U know  your food and you rather  argue with  me instead  of justify the situation. 
Folks  just think you can talk  to people  any kind of way.  WE WON'T RETURN!"}
{"text":"Every year on my foodie road trip to Florida, Inlook for irresistible restaurants that have been on tv food shows. This was so far out of our way but once I saw the Hot Chicken on Diners Drive-ins and Dives I knew it would be worth the drive. 
The friendliest staff and patrons I've ever come across. Inside there is only 1 tiny counter with 2 seats so I ether eat in your car or bring it home. This chicken and onion rings were the best I've ever had of either! I would definitely go back if it wasn't so far off our root. I will find some way to get back here one day. Loveeee this Dive"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Bar-B-Que King since I was a little kid and my parents dated there for years before I was even a gleam in their eyes. Happily, I can say it is just as good now as I remember it being as a kid. (My parents would load me & my siblings in the backseat and we'd stop in here for dinner, then stop by the Dairy Queen for dessert, and then we would go to the drive in movies, where we'd inevitably fall asleep before the movie was over!) 

Two things I always order here are the onion rings (which are home-made not frozen!) and a cherry lemon sundrop! 

When I was growing up, I didn't generally care for bar-b-que, but I really liked theirs. As a kid, I also loved their Po Boys. Now, I don't eat beef or pork at all, but they have plenty of other things on their menu besides pork bar-b-que & hamburgers such as fish, chicken, and grilled cheese.  The barbequed chicken is messy but delish. 

The servers are typically quite entertaining and usually really hustle. Once we even sat indoors (they have a couple of little bar stools at a counter) which was quite entertaining as well! Almost everything here is pretty much fried, but the quality of the food is excellent considering! Love this place! 

For those who've never been, this is an honest-to-goodness drive -in where you typically sit in your car to order and eat. They do have a TINY counter with a couple of stools inside for those who do not want to eat in the car - but it is really small and cramped inside, so don't expect a \"sit down\" dining experience! 

Also, I don't think they take plastic - so make sure you have cash on hand before you go."}
{"text":"Been here easily 100 times. Place is a staple on the Charlotte food scene! Go to order is Half BBQ Chicken with onion rings & fries. Can't go wrong with a PO Boy or the Grilled Chicken Tender Dinner.

Cherry Lemon Sun Drop freshly mixed, must have!"}
{"text":"Saw it on Triple D, looked great. 

Showed up to the ghetto as expected, but the meal was underwhelming.

I had the chicken fingers dunked in BBQ sauce as featured on the show. 

Not very good.

Cash only.

Did it, won't do it again."}
{"text":"I saw Bar-B-Q King on Guy Fieri's Food Network show, \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\", awhile back, so I thought I'd check it out for lunch.

I got the 1/4 barbecue chicken plate, which included fries, cole slaw, and \"dinner bread\" (AKA \"hamburger bun\").  The barbecue chicken was featured on the show because of the unique way that it's prepared - fried and then dipped in barbecue sauce.  The chicken was pretty good.  But that was the only highlight of the trip.  Nothing was terrible, but everything except the chicken was below average, even for a drive-in.

To Bar-B-Q King's credit, everyone should try the barbecue chicken once.  If I get a hankering for it, I'll stop in again.  Until then, I'll leave the king to his royal responsibilities.

ps  If you want a throwback to the early days of the Internet, check out the website - 40 different fonts, animated text, bad graphics."}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 stars because of lack of consistency
the first time that I went, I went by myself, ordered through the intercom and the food was great! I had the dipped BBQ chicken.

The second time was a terrible experience
I took 2 co-workers and the intercom to order wasn't working, so a man came over to our car to take the order.  He kept forgetting what we ordered. After taking our order and walking to the building to place the order, he would come back 5-10 minutes later to ask what was our order again?   One of the times he came back, he mentioned, I don't know if we have what you ordered.  He said this about the 3 time he came back to the car. by then we knew if we left to find someplace else to eat, we wouldn't get lunch at all.
 We pointed at the menu, showing what we were interested in and asked, \"you don't have this on the menu\" (pointing again at chicken) and then he left again to go back in the main building.

 We eventually got our food, my meal was cold and my co-worker found hair in his food.   I have never gone back and my co-workers bring this experience up, whenever I suggest somewhere to eat. 

It was such a confusing and strange experience."}
{"text":"We saw this place on Diners Drive-ins & Dives, just like so many others, and decided to give it a try on our way to Asheville today.

And...I am soooo glad we did!

First...yes, the intercom system is dated, and hard to hear, oh well...I chalk that up to character. We didn't know what to order, so my lovey hubby went inside to ask what they recommended. 

David asked him, \"How many you got?\" And proceeded to invite us inside to sit and eat...they only have 2 stools, and we felt happy to be invited. (He also said, \"bring your missus inside, and we'll take care of you.)

The inside is just as dated as the intercom...but, we asked what to order and they recommended the BBQ chicken and BBQ pork plate.

Now, I must admit, we are from Augusta, and as true Augustians, we have one BBQ love...Sconyers...it is simply the best in the world, and we have been bred to eat it.

But, BBQ King does a real decent job of the pork!!! I was happy to share the plate with my lovey hubby, and we enjoyed it...the sauce was Texas Pete based...and very tasty.

I must give a mention to their cole slaw...they have a \"secret\" ingredient, which just happens to be MY secret ingredient also!!! Celery seeds... and they really make for a tasty slaw! (try it next time you make cole slaw...it is so good!)

I've saved the best for last...their BBQ dipped fried chicken. Now, I saw this on Guy Fieri's show...and didn't think it could be good at all...I thought, \"Fried chicked, dipped in sauce??? It'll get all soggy...won't be good at all...\" 

Well, folks...I was WRONG. They fry it so crispy...then dip it at the last minute before serving...so you get this absolutely delicious, crispy, juicy, tender BBQ chicken. I will go on record as saying: BEST BBQ CHICKEN EVER...possibly the best fried chicken ever!!! It really is that good...it is incredible and original...and I can't believe that every where doesn't serve chicken like this.

Last, but not least...get the cherry sun-drop...yes, it is sun-drop, but with cherry syrup...I've never had it anywhere else. (I'm very sheltered, obviously!)"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork bbq sandwich and if was really good. The sauce was tangy southern style vinegar based sauce that came on the side which was nice because the bun didn't get soggy.  The hush puppies were homemade and tasted great.  But the real star of the menu was the bbq chicken; it was totally off the hook.  Deep fried and then dunked in their signature sauce, it was a AMAZING.  I don't typically like chicken on the bone or dark meat but I dove right in and I am glad I did, this place is the real deal.  The only thing I didn't like was the coleslaw; it wasn't very good but the bread they served on the side was really good.  This is a true old school drive inn and you eat in your car, which was a negative for me.  It was tough to eat this amazing bbq in our car.  It is nostalgic to eat at a drive inn but not practical when grubbing on bbq.

Service was friendly and it was an all around great experience.  They don't take credit cards but they so have an atm on site (that charges you $2 transaction fee).  Not too far off Interstate 77 so if you are driving through Charlotte take exit 9C and stop on in for a real BBQ treat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite drive in.  This place is amazing.  I always get the Jumbo Cheeseburger and wouldn't have anything else.  They are famous for their chicken too.  Fabulous place."}
{"text":"The BBQ fried chicken is amazing and completely lived up to all the excellent reviews.  I stopped here on my way back to Ohio, just to try the chicken!  The sweet tea was perfect too.  Fantastic!  Staff was very friendly, prices are great too.  I'll stop again the next time I'm in Charlotte :)"}
{"text":"Rude doesn't even fully describe the OWNER! 

Tonight was my first time trying this place and I was really excited because of the reviews and Guy. I had a few menu questions and the outside staff was helpful and helped to the best of their knowledge. 

I went in to order and that is when I encountered the owner. I asked him to clarify was a \"deviled crab\" was and he said it was a crab cake. I told him oh okay I'm from Maryland so I'm used to a different crab cake and did it have peppers in it? He said they don't make it so he doesn't know but it has pepper in it rudely. 

Placed my ordered and was waiting....food comes and after looking over the menu I saw my platter came with my choice of fish. I asked him what kind did it come with (he defaulted it to trout) and if possible could he switch it to the perch since he never asked/I didn't know. He responded politely BUT turned the corner and proceeded to talk about me to the kitchen.  Saying things since as she didn't know what a crab cake was and she is from Maryland, she should be able to tell me what a crab cake is, now she wants to change her fish...etc etc. 

I stood there and listen as well as the other 5 or so customers that were in there. When he came back I calmly said I would like just like to pay for my tea I was drinking and if he wants to speak about customers he should make sure they can't not hear him. Good night. 

The owner offered no apology, nothing. I will not go back."}
{"text":"i really didn't appreciate the man who brought me my order asking me for a tip. here's a tip, don't ask for a tip. i worked as a food server for many years; and rule #1 is never ever ask for a tip. tips are earned! as for the food, i was epically disappointed. thanks for nothing guy fieri."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious me and the hubby were for dinner. Love this place the fiod is always fresh and hot and not a long wait absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Visited 'cause Fieri featured BBQ King on both DDD and Best Thing I Ever Ate.  Really?  Like other reviewers stated, the food is good but not great IMO.  I ordered the chicken with onion rings, and chose to eat in my car--big mistake.  The entree is very messy and carving my way through it with a plastic fork didn't cut it.  By the time I finished wrestling with it, I had more sauce on me than was on the plate!

I am willing to try them again when I can eat from a table.  Maybe I'll be more inspired, or should try something else.  For now I'm on the fence.  

Notes:  Great service.  Fast.  Friendly.  Easy to find.  Good value.  Cash only."}
{"text":"A DDD spot. 
Cash only.
Ordered BBQ chicken, sliced pork sammy and apple pie ala mode.
I LOVE their BBQ sauce.
Chicken was awesome. Fried then dunked in the sauce. 
Sliced pork was moist. However, I should have gotten the pulled pork so it sopped up more sauce...or at least asked for some sauce on the side for dipping. 

If I am in Charlotte again I will go back. 
Only next time I will ask for more sauce and pickles!"}
{"text":"I can see why this place was featured on Triple D. I love Guy, so I had to try the bbq chicken like he recommended. They deep fry the chicken first then coat it in bbq, so it was almost like jumbo wings. I also got the onion rings which had a nice, thin layer. Since they're known for their regular bbq, I have no choice but to go back to try it and one of their shakes. With its quick service and family atmosphere, it's no wonder it's been around since 1959!"}
{"text":"I've been going to BBQ King since i was very young. Some of the best BBQ Chicken you'll find in Charlotte. If you like granola or are watching your weight, this is probably not the place for you. If you like good food, you've found the place. The car hops have been there as long as i can remember and remember their customers"}
{"text":"This review is LONG overdue as we have been coming here for years.  We're from up north, but have family living in NC.  When we visit, we always make a trip here, even though it's not around the corner.  Love their pulled pork!   THE best around, hands down.  Their other food is awesome as well.   And the hushpuppies - YUM!!!! Like home cooking!  Brings me back in time when you could drive in to a place and be served in the car.  The guys here are great and very helpful.  If you're in the Charlotte area and are a fan of BBQ, this is definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"It's ok. If you like Vinegar then you'll probably like the BBQ sauce. I got the 1/4 fried chicken dipped in the bbq sauce & they let me sub the onion rings for the fries for a small extra charge, which i appreciated. The chicken was fairly crispy even with the sauce and the chicken was juicy but, to me,I don't know it's worth another trip for it. The onion rings were ok. They were crispy & the whole onion doesn't come out when you bite it so that was nice but there's really no flavor to them. Courteous staff but I don't know that I would go out of my way to get the food again."}
{"text":"BBQ King (which was featured on Diner, Drive-ins an Dives) is my go-to for comfort food for those days that happen once in a while ... Bad days, good days, days where it's raining outside, days where the scale is in my favor, days when the scale has a glitch and I'm five pounds heavier, days between Sunday and Monday, etc. I love the BBQ Friend Chicken. Great taste. Good value. Nom. Nom. Nom.

Location: 3/5
It's right on Wilkinson which is a pretty big, busy 4-lane roadway if not divided highway. Not the easiest to navigate into and out of but it's well worth the hassle and potential car wreck.

Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3/5
 BBQ King is an old-school drive-in joint where the car hops come to you car with your grub after you placed your order in a Charlie's Angels speaker-box. Think of Sonic but ya know, like back in the 60's and stuff. It probably hasn't been updated much since then either. But yeah, who's going here for a date? PSA: I would love to be brought here for a date, but that's just me. 

Cleanliness: 4/5
See above.The facilities are dated but my food has also been on point in terms of hair to food ratio. 

Service: 4/5
The Car Hops are cordial and friendly. The staff inside are likely as well.

Food: 5/5
Dear Little Baby Jesus, that BBQ Fried Chicken is amazing. It stays crispy even while slathered in tangy BBQ sauce. I can't string the words together that'll do justice to this culinary masterpiece. I love BBQ and I love fried chicken and I have become some what of an aficionado so yeah, I know my stuff. You will not be disappointed. The hush-puppies are legit too."}
{"text":"I had not been here before but saw it on Diners Drive-ins and Dives and thought I'd try it. Everything was hot and very tasty except the one thing I was looking forward to. The fried chicken was very plain, no spice to it at all, not even a little salt. Very disappointing. If I go back I will definitely order something else. Loved the nostalgic atmosphere! It's nice to see some old Charlotte left!"}
{"text":"The fried catfish was fresh and yummy. However, their pulled pork is a little too vinegary to my taste.

I regretted for not trying their BBQ chicken because it looked and smelled delicious.

Based on the conversation with a staff there (may be the owner), they specialize in chicken and pork. They don't do beef.

They still have the 60's drive-in style (similar to sonic). You can put your order in while sitting in your car and they will bring the food out. Coolio."}
{"text":"I am giving five stars purely for the BBQ fried chicken. It is life altering. They take super crispy fried chicken, dunk it right out of the fryer into their delicious vinegary BBQ sauce, serve it atop a piece of white bread.  I'll never eat fried chicken anywhere else, and I apologize to Bojangles as I've been known to do some damage there on hangover days.

Their pork BBQ is ok. The sauce is what makes it. They don't really put a lot of smoke on it while cooking, so I don't view it as the best meat naked. But their sauce is stupid good and has some smoke in it so when poured over the meat the Q is fairly solid.

Sides are Ok. Beans are prob from a can.

If you are willing to try a new twist on fried chicken definitely go out of your way to try this place. Or stop on the way to airport. If you just want really good pork BBQ probably head to Saucemans or Midwood in the Plaza."}
{"text":"We just love to eat at locations featured on the Triple D food show. I have never been excited about the vinegar style NC BBQ but this was delicious.  I had the BBQ chicken Dinner.  Hot, crispy, crunchy on the outside chicken that was full of flavor and moist on the inside.  The fries were freshly cooked and scorching hot, the way they should be served.  The cole slaw was just as I like it, not drowning in mayo.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  Lots is napkins needed on this yummy meal."}
{"text":"The BBQ fried chicken was interesting and good. The breast meat was very juicy. The highlight was the onion rings. This is what onion rings are all about, very thin breading and super crunchy. I'm thinking about going back for some more rings. The lemon cherry sundrop is worth trying as well. $11.20 for 1/2 chicken, slaw, onion rings, and large soda."}
{"text":"I have not tried much other than the bbq fried chicken at bbq king, but what I have tried has been outstanding. The bbq sauce on the chicken is freaking awesome and the chicken is fried perfectly, but I would never order anything outside of that"}
{"text":"Great historic place here, and definitely worth coming here 3 or 4 times a year... any more than that and my arteries would explode!

Their BBQ chicken is deep fried, soaked in a tangy buffalo sauce, served with adequate hush puppies, and absolutely worth trying at least once.

Great family owned place, you can order from your car, but remember CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"We visited based on Guy Fieri's recommendation on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\".  We were not sure what to make out upon arrival.  It is an older drive in style restaurant.  The ordering microphone did not work very well so a gentleman came out and took our order.  We ordered the 1/2 chicken to split as we just wanted to try and see what all the fuss was about.  We received a large bow with 4 pieces of what looked like fried chicken with a red hot sauce all over it, some cole slaw, and french fries.  We drove off and ate it while driving.  Once we saw that it was fried chicken we felt that it was not going to be that good.  After eating a few pieces I was still not impressed but kept eating.  All of a sudden it was gone and I was licking my fingers wondering where it all went.  Should we go back for more?  I think the red hot sauce has some sort of additive substance that once you have some, it leaves you wanting more.

Skin on chicken was delicious.  Sauce was awesome..
Cole slaw was great.  Didn't eat the french fries."}
{"text":"We were really excited to be visiting Charlotte after seeing this place on the Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\"  My hubby and I are both eastern transplants that now live in Utah so we get really excited for real Southern BBQ when we come back to visit.

Pros: This place is old! I loved that they are still using the original ordering system.  It was fun imagining what this place must have been in it's heyday. Also, there's a big menu so everyone will find something they like. The fried chicken dipped in barbecue sauce was amazing!  I will go back there just for that dish.

Cons: Cash only! We had to use their ATM machine in order to pay for our meal. That means getting out of your car to go inside at a drive-up place. Some \"retro\" stuff isn't so cute, like not taking credit cards.  Also, the guy who delivered our food to the car basically asked for a tip which I thought was quite rude. Also, a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. The pork bbq was so-so and the hush puppies were too greasy, like they tried to cook too many in the fryer at one time. The french fries were blah.

Final note: go for the fried chicken but go elsewhere for your 'cue fix."}
{"text":"It's cheap, the food is the same I'm sure as it's been for 60 years. There is nothing fancy going here it's pulled pork beans and bread and fries. The pork was pretty damn good, we aren't  locals so we went out of our way to find it because we saw it on triple D on food network. I would say it's a one and done kinda place. The drive in part was neat. Worth a one time trip to it."}
{"text":"First of all, I LOVE fried chicken!  I saw this place on Diner's, Drive-in's, and Dives. Everything I saw looked awesome, but what really sold it for me was when they took that juicy, crunchy, delicious piece of chicken and dunked it in the BBQ sauce.  

When we were in Charlotte one weekend I knew what needed to be done.  We had lunch at Bar-B-Q King with high expectations because of what we saw on TV. I will definitely tell you from experience that it is a must to come eat here.  I ordered the bbq dipped chicken with onion rings. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. The sauce that it was dipped in complimented it very well. Onion rings were crunchy and not greasy.  I hate when you bite into an onion ring and the whole onion comes out and you're left with just the batter.  These did not do that.  

Coming here was a great experience. Very old school. Drive up and order by pushing a button on a box then wait for them to deliver the food to your car window. This place is awesome and has become a must when in the Charlotte area. If you are flying in to the Charlotte airport it is only 5 minutes from there."}
{"text":"While I love the idea of a drive-in in theory, in practice I'm always annoyed by it.  Couple that with the fact that much of Bar-B-Q King's food isn't ideal for car eating, and the experience is not necessarily the best, though I can't really fault Bar-B-Q King for that, I suppose.  The car hops are helpful and friendly, and their food is delicious.  The sauce on the dipped chicken is somewhere between a buffalo style and bbq sauce. 

It's definitely worth the trip, but if you are from Charlotte, I'd grab it to go."}
{"text":"A 1/4 dark BBQ fried chicken meal with fries & slaw is hands down one of the best meals in Charlotte - if not the entire country!  I just want to smear it all over my face its so good.  Every time I'm back visiting home I have stop at Bar-B-Q King on the way home from the airport.  This is hands down some of the best food I've come across - and I've been all over the world!

The old-fashioned drive-in experience is unique. The staff has a \"we know our food is great\" attitude in my opinion it adds a certain level of authenticity and persona that I look forward to every time I go.

Don't forget the sweet tea either...Its the best I've ever had!

If you are in charlotte and you can only choose one place to have lunch... THIS IS IT!"}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte several years ago, and had wanted to eat there for ages. After seeing it on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\", I *finally* made the extra effort to make it out there (they're closed on Sundays and Mondays).

I got the BBQ chicken, which was advertised on DD&D as \"fried chicken coated in East Carolina-style BBQ sauce\". Well, the sauce is far too thick and sweet to be traditional East Carolina-style sauce (which is sort of like Tabasco sauce). Although a disappointment, the fried chicken itself was well done, perfectly cooked and juicy.

The fries are nothing to write home about, probably frozen commercial. But they were cooked well and nicely salted. The onion rings were far better, especially if you're a fan of the cornmeal variety. I'm not a fan of cole slaw, but the slaw seemed fresh and was pretty tasty.

One knock - my friend ordered a Sun Drop, and received a Coke, even though the order ticket was clearly marked as Sun Drop. Yeah, we coulda used the speaker to call someone to fix it (and for $17.85 for a drive-in lunch, we should have)."}
{"text":"We decided to check it out after watching a tv show were a guy raved about how good the food was. We pulled up and saw that it had the old fashioned car hop drive thru thing going on. We read through the menu that was posted next to the intercom/order microphone. Before we got a chance to order through the intercom, a waiter came over with a pen and pad and jotted down our order. The menu had a lot of variety. I had the Po Boy with onion rings and my boyfriend had the signature barbecue chicken. The pricing was ok. Probably a little more than the typical fast food place but a little cheaper than a dine-in restaurant. The Po Boy is basically a large hamburger. The beef itself was under-seasoned but it was slathered in mustard. The bun was soggy and gooey. The onion rings were overcooked and super hard and difficult to chew without fear of breaking a tooth. I took a sip of my sweet tea and it was barely sweet and watered down. My boyfriend seemed to like the chicken so I tried a small piece. I was unimpressed. The fried outer portion was soft and soggy with their special sauce. I may be the minority here but I don't want anything that's fried to be wet and soggy even if the sauce is tasty. I didn't finish any of the food from the restaurant and opted for leftovers from my fridge. 

Since this place gets such good reviews, I'm willing to go back and give them another chance.  They may have been having a bad day so we're willing to go back. So for now, I say that the food doesn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"This was, I believe, #8 on my Diners, Drivers, and Dives stops, and being a BBQ connoisseur, I had to give BBQ King a try. This is a drive in BBQ place and definitely has a hometown feel. As I pulled up I was greeted by a guy who came out to meet me. After a bit of conversation and defining what it was exactly I was ordering, I ordered the chopped pork sandwich. Now, allow me to say I'm from Texas so obviously I do not agree that what they serve in NC is even remotely \"BBQ\", however... \"When in Rome\". So, I this review is written with that in mind. The sandwich was topped by finely chopped slaw and was actually really good. They also offered me BBQ sauce on the side which was also pretty good. The fries were bland and nothing special but ok. The Coke however ... Was. Freaking. Awesome!  It had just the right bite to it and tasted amazing. All in all it wasn't the best I've ever had but was certainly good for what it was and was exactly what I ordered despite not being confident that I placed it correctly. I do recommend stopping in if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My Ist time experience was GOOD! 
Visiting Charlotte for the 2nd time and I made this place a must stop after seeing it featured on the Food Network a few years a go. 
Saw a few folk carrying boxes to go, so we thought it was going to be worth the try!!

The place hasn't change since it was show on FN. The food was worth the money. We had 1/4 BBQ Chicken ( comes with F.F., Cole Slaw & a Roll), a Minced BBQ Pork sandwich, Fried Onion Rings (regular sized) and a Cherry Lemon Sundrop soda (Large sized) totaling $16.45.
The place has friendly car hops working for a tip. One of the retired owners came over and carried on a conversation, especially after finding out we were not Charlotte natives, but visiting after asking us if we were enjoying our food as we were munching down!

As for the food, I expected the chicken to be crunchier, but it was hot and seasoned well to the bone. I didn't find the bbq sauce too vinegary; kind of disappointed in that, but never the less it was all GOOD!  I thought the Cherry Lemon Sundrop could of had more cherry syrup and lemon flavoring, but over all it was tasty and refreshing. My sister said her sandwich was just okay, but she loved the Onion Rings. She thought they were reminsent to a place back in Greenville/Mauldin, SC where she lives. Come to find out the place she was referring to was owned by the owner's son in-law. Small World!!

I would make a return trip if in the Charlotte area and had a hankering for some BBQ FRIED CHICKEN and a Drive-In experience!!"}
{"text":"Family is great. Breakfast is my favorite part, ppl from all walks of life come here and it makes for an interesting and eclectic vibe"}
{"text":"3rd time here even though I live in Oregon, I saw this on triple d one night. The food is homemade and fresh. The fried chicken is very good, which I had on my first 2 visits. On the visit I got the west side burger and onion rings. One of the best burgers I've ever had and the rings are great, no frozen deep fried rings here!  They are fresh and crisp. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Simple, great food..great sweet tea. Get it to go, or eat in your car. Its setup like a typical drive-in. You order from your car, and they bring it out. 

I ordered the Sweet Tea, Sliced BBQ Sandwich, and Chopped BBQ sandwich. Both sandwiches are terrific. Sweat tea was small, although good.  Service is fast, prices are good and worth it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fine dining establishment...well, this isn't it. And by that I mean, this is a place to stop in and either (a) eat in your car (I've yet to venture inside, it's typically slammed!) or (b) if you live 10 minutes away as we do, take it home and devour it there. This is no frills food but it is good. 

My husband and I have ventured to Bar-B-Q King a few times now and have yet to be disappointed. When we're in the mood for some quick grub that is better than fast food, this is what we seek out. I've gotten the dipped BBQ chicken (it was unique and delicious, definitely something I've never had anywhere else) and the seafood platter. My husband as had the chicken liver sandwich (he's adventurous) and the BBQ combo plate. We've enjoyed the fries, onion rings, the hush puppies (maybe the best I've ever had), and the slaw (which isn't my favorite). The service has been good though we typically end up waiting for our food longer than we'd like (we normally go during dinner time and they're slammed) but that is a small hiccup. 

Overall, I firmly believe Bar-B-Q King is worth at least one visit so you can give this historic drive-in a whirl."}
{"text":"I sought out Bar-B-Q King after seeing it on Triple D, but I can't say there's anything special about this place beyond the novelty of an old-fashioned drive-in. True, they do dunk their fried chicken in their barbecue sauce, and while it's not bad, it's not exceptional either. The pulled pork isn't very smoky, but the sauce, slaw, & hushpuppies are decent. 

On a bit of a negative note, my server asked me two times for my beverage order, & despite saying \"Sweet Tea\" both times...I got a Coke. 

I really really really wanted Bar-B-Q King to be awesome, to remind me of & even surpass my hometown drive-in that looks much the same (Na-Bers, if you're ever in Bryson City, NC)...but it didn't. It was just average, & for that reason I'd recommend passing on by."}
{"text":"My favorite date night spot with my husband! Minced bbq sandwiches, fries, to die for onion rings are our go to meal. Not many true drive in's left which makes this one even more special!"}
{"text":"Great for what it is. An old school diner. Had a hamburger and fries. Only complaint would be to change out the bun. It doesn't hold up and breaks apart as you are eating. My dinner companion had a hotdog and fries and had the same issue with his bun."}
{"text":"We went fairly late after arriving into Charlotte from our drive from Atlanta. You pull up into a spot and a runner comes out to take your order, then brings you your food and you pay for it. You can also go up to the walk-up counter yourself. 

I ordered fried fish with fries and coleslaw. My brother got pulled pork with onion rings and coleslaw; it also came with two hushpuppies. You also get a bread roll. The food was okay, but I wasn't particularly impressed by any of it. Prices are inexpensive and portions are decent though."}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected. The food was ok but not crazily yummy like shown on triple Ds"}
{"text":"Late night looks shady, but I'm a stranger in these parts. 
Burger is cheap, but tasty. 
Chocolate shake is just ok. 
Cheap, but I didn't get my 35 cents in change!
Sticky order box, wish I didn't have to touch it to order."}
{"text":"I hit lunch here about once a month (a bit of a drive from work) and have always went with their famous BBQ dipped fried chicken platter. However I mixed it up and went with 2 of their hot dogs \"Carolina Style\" and I have say, one of the best hog dogs around. I got these as take-out so the bun was a little soggy when I got back to work (but most people will eat these in the parking lot). The slaw, chili, onions, and mustard combination over a big boiled dog = A+"}
{"text":"NASTY NASTY NASTY first who in the H*** still takes cash only? then you have some guy that looks like he just got out of jail for selling crack with a hand  full on cash...That takes your order .. Ok so you have to find cash . But they have a atm Damm so $2.50 for the atm fee and then $2.50 from my bank . Then $10.00 bucks for this nasty food So for all to see is a $15.00 dollar meal At BBQ King what a rip off . I walked in and thought I was going to pass out from the nasty smell of rotten onions .

          They might have been great 30 or 20 years ago and I saw people eating this  this ... I do not know what it is its not food nor BBQ.Health Department must feel sorry for them any other place they would close done"}
{"text":"I took a trip down to Florida and stopped at this place on a tip.  This is an old school drive-in.  You order through this old switchboard and they car hop to get your order.  

Simple food, but very good.  You have to try the BBQ fried chicken.  It is a unique recipe.  It is great.  

If you want to try a different dining experience try this place out and try the chicken.  It is also very affordable.

Thanks"}
{"text":"If you love BBQ, fried chicken, burgers, and amazing slaw; this is where its at. My family and I have known these folks every since I can remember, and every time I have been there, its be fresh and right on the money. Its affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"I said to myself I haven't reviewed places that I tried when I traveled to other cities. So this will be the inaugural review of that:

There's something about me that loves old fashioned, vintage decor. Some not all and decor that's not to the point of downright scary or dirty. Bar-B-Q King is one of those places. It's feels like this place that hasn't changed but yet the areas surrounding it has. Once you set yourself inside it seems like you are taken back. That's what these vintage places do to me.

Now the food: I went with what they were known for: bbq pulled pork and bbq fried chicken. Now I'm not a \"wet\" fried chicken kind of guy but it does work and work well. The sauce and somehow it retains the crunch. I haven't experimented if the crunch still pertains after a few hours though because of the smell, it won't let me lol. Pulled pork fries and hush puppies were all superb! All of the fixing for less than $15! It's a drive in so I recommend you just find a spot, order and have the nice servers walk your food to your car. They do accept tips so it's optional.

I ended up going there 3 times during my stay in Charlotte and in my opinion this is as good as Charlotte BBQ gets. Only if you share my taste in what makes good BBQ. If not there are other of newly established decors that has great bbq but this spot is just so unique, I hope it never goes away."}
{"text":"Old school drive in charm, best BBQ fried chicken ever.

Get the BBQ fried chicken.  It's so good.  They perfectly fry a peice of chicken, then dunk it in BBQ sauce.  It's so good.

Their BBQ sauce is the perfect consistency and didn't ruin the breading on the chicken.  It adds so much flavor.

To be honest I've never gotten anything other main dish, so I can't speak to those.

The sides are good, I like the coleslaw best.  Fries are good also.

Did I mention you should try the BBQ fried chicken???"}
{"text":"So Bar-B-Q King is definitely a step back in time....in so many different ways. First it is a drive-in that still has what looks like the original speakers. Not much has changed about this location from the late 50s...and I mean that in the most honest way. But first let me talk about the food. 

So I ordered the famous BBQ Fried Chicken with a side of onion rings and coleslaw. I suppose the coleslaw is a southern thing because it really didn't taste like anything and could've just been left off the menu. The fried chicken was wonderful, crispy with the sweet barbque sauce on it. I felt if could've had more sauce. The onion rings were mediocre, the batter was heavy and didn't seem very seasoned.  I also had their sweet tea which was definitely southern sweet tea but not anything I finished or would buy again. My friend purchased the jumbo fried shrimp was was jumbo with a crisp coating. The shrimp was good but the batter was just ok..not heavily seasoned or bursting with flavor. Overall the food gets a B-. It wasn't awful, just not amazing. The best thing I tasted was the fried chicken. 
The service...Well as in all Drive-in's car-hops walk to your car to take your order and bring your order and to take your tray away. Up north in Indiana where I'm from, these are usually young teens....at the restaurant, it was done by middle age black men..who were amazingly nice and did their job well...however seemed waay to qualified for that position and it can make a person feel a tad uncomfortable...especially in this current highly charged political climate and we are in the south being served by older black men...and many of the customers were middle aged to older white patrons. It was almost a flashback to the '50s...and that made me and my friends very weary and uncomfortable. 

Nevertheless it was an experience and the chicken was tasty...."}
{"text":"Sorry but this place has nasty gross food.  I've tried it twice just to be fair.... Never again.  The bbq was dry and had absolutely no flavor.  The burger I had was dry as a desert as well with no flavor.  It just wasn't good.   It was like they let a 20 yr old white girl in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. Hands down, the best fried chicken I've ever had. The bbq fried chicken is just outstanding, and the skin is crispy, and the bbq sauce has a subtle flavor that compliments the chicken perfectly. Also, for dessert, get the apple pie with ice cream. The best apple pie I've ever had in my life!!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in like 4 years, but I'm currently sitting here at Charlotte-Douglas airport, daydreaming about how amazing this place is. 

A lot can change in 4 years, but the value was unprecedented. It was something like 5 or 6 bucks for a ridiculous amount of food. The BBQ fried chicken was just out of this world- nice crispy fried chicken, but soaked in this deliciously tangy, vinegary BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"BBQ King is all the reviewers say and more. The intercom in completely unintelligible. The neighborhood doesn't feel terribly unsafe, but I hear tales about Camp Greene (2 blocks over). The barbecue chicken is off the Richter good, but definitely strange.
I've never had barbecue chicken that was battered and fried first, then seemingly baked in tangy sauce. The skin is more than crunchy, it's FIRM. But sticky and chewy and tasty. It just feels like something you shouldn't eat more than once a year, unless you wanna join Elizabeth. nahmean?"}
{"text":"i heard about this place on diners, drive-ins, and dives.  it is definitely an interesting place.  The wait staff is extremely friendly, really quick to get out the food.  This restaurant is right near the airport, so depending on the time of day you go there, there may be a ton of traffic heading out of Charlotte.

I tried the 1/2 BBQ chicken dinner with fries and coleslaw.  It was pretty good, nothing really special about the fried chicken at all.  They must change the oil frequently, because there was no residue of past chicken fryings.  They serve the chicken with BBQ sauce already on top.  It is half decent, but nothing amazing.

Come here for the notoriety of being on the Food network and also the friendliness and quick staff."}
{"text":"I LOVE the BBQ King!  For years, I'm amazed I just drove by this place on the way to/from the airport in Charlotte not thinking much of it, but then I saw it featured on Diners' Drive-ins and Dives.  Now, I am a regular.  It is a ritual for me to stop every time I'm coming home from the airport (or I just need some awesome fried indulgence).  The two best things on the menu are the BBQ chicken (note that this is fried chicken dipped in BBQ sauce) and the onion rings.  Some of the best onion rings I've ever had.  I always opt to go for dark meat chicken, since I think it has more flavor than white meat.  That first bite of a leg with that tangy sauce is heaven.  

A little piece of advice if you do get take out.  If you leave the food in those cardboard containers too long, it will get soggy on the drive home.  I usually un-staple the lids to let the steam out to keep the food from over steaming itself.  I prefer to lose a little of the temperature for crispier food when I sit down at home.  The best experience is to eat it in the car.  Granted, your car will smell like BBQ King for days, but it is such a wonderful smell.

A little side note.  My wife asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner this year.  I've been to many of the great restaurants in town, such as Fig Tree, but my choice for my birthday meal is the BBQ King!  I absolutely love it!

If you haven't tried it, do it.  It's awesome.  Bring cash!"}

{"text":"The popcorn shrimp was good. The pulled pork sandwich lacked sauce. It is beyond me why they don't add sauce to the sandwich. We were all fans of the fried bbq chicken.  It is soft, moist, and has a vinegar taste.  We got a breast and a wing without having to pay an up charge. This is most likely the only item that we will order next time.  The french fries were really good, but the cheap Hunt's ketchup was not an asset.  The fries are good and definitely worth gracing with Heinz ketchup. the hush puppies were nothing to write home about. I like something added to my hush puppy like onion. The onion rings were of the flour variety with the fried casing kept falling off.  I prefer the crunchy cornmeal type. They are closed Sunday and Monday, so we had to wait for them to open Tuesday.  The iced tea was delicious and it was already sweetened! The cole slaw was delicious, just like grandma used to make.  The potato salad was meh. The roll was meh.  Thank goodness were were traveling with cash because they don't accept credit cards. We will go back and after reading other reviews i am curious to try the cherry lemon sundrop."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY

Great dive place.  Heart attack on a plate.  Lotsa of tasty greasy fattening food.  Loved the chicken bbq and the onion rings.  If you are into  Americana, this is the place for you.  Tip the guy that brings the food a little bit and ask for extra napkins."}
{"text":"Best Barbecued chicken in the city order extra sauce, it's too die for!! Homemade Apple pie is great too!
One of my fave places."}
{"text":"Best bbq fried chicken I've ever had. If you dont want your chicken over sauced then just order the fried chicken and have the bbq sauce on the side for dipping. Bbq pork was yummy and pulled pork style. Onion rings were fresh, hot, and stayed crispy even after cooling. Great comfort food and drive in style but if you want to drop in there's a little room inside that might seat up to 4 people.  :)"}
{"text":"You get 1 star instead of two because the dude that brought us our food to our car, DEMANDED his tip.  DUDE - HERE'S A TIP - DON'T ASK FOR A TIP.

CASH ONLY.

I wanted to come to this place because it was on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and fried chicken and bbq sauce.  Need I say more?

Well, would I go back the next time I'm in town.  No thanks, I'll be making my way over to South 21 or Price's Chicken Coop.

The sauce was too vinegary for my taste. The chicken was somewhat moist, but I did feel that it might have been sitting around.  Everyone else in my party said the same thing.  The fries were definitely old and sitting around.  

and well, the guy demanding a tip put a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I am overly stuffed from the fried chicken lunch plate I just ate. Fresh fried chicken dipped in homemade BBQ sauce with homemade sides of coleslaw and hush puppies. This was my first time but not my last time. This is a place everyone in Charlotte should try. When you go their... look for Dave. He is very personable. Dave has been a part of the wait staff for 35 years."}
{"text":"Along Wilkinson Boulevard there are a couple of these old drive-in restaurants left.  The Bar-B-Q King serves a large variety of food, but everyone seems to come for (surprise) the barbecue, hamburgers and hot dogs.

The onion rings are served in a heaping pile as well, and it's one of the few places you can get a Cherry Lemon Sun Drop where they actually add the cherry and lemon to the Sun Drop rather than pour it from premix."}
{"text":"This is some seriously good BBQ chicken. 
Deep fried then dipped in BBQ sauce.
Never had any other BBQ chicken like it."}
{"text":"Fire flames. Hard to have a complaint here, came down from NY to visit a friend at Wake Forest so we ventured over o Charlotte for a day and boy was this good. Chicken, Pulled Pork, fries, hush puppies, all for like under $10. The only tough part was taking down all that grizzy grub in a backseat. Flavortown, USA."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been running for over 30 years. I went here with my parents over 20 years ago. A lovely old lady used to run this restaurant so we decided to revisit this restaurant to see how she's doing. The restaurant is now run by her son and his family because she is now retired, but the food remains fresh and delicious! The family is super friendly and still remembers us after all these years.  We got chicken souvlakis, which you could have the option of having it on a bun or on a pita, or as a dinner with salad and rice. It was also endearing to see old arcade games in the restaurant, which you could play for a quarter. Will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Americana at it's greatest. I was travelling from Philadelphia to Richmond, to South Carolina to North Carolina to Georgia over the weekend. 
I was road tripping with my friend and she was doing some bike racing down south. After racing in Charlotte, we were driving down to Georgia. We were hungry and following the GPS. As we were driving I saw this place on the side of the road. We drove in and pulled up to an odering place. 
(this is a place that sonic is based off of but no rollerskates)

I ordered the shredded pork sandwich and my friend ordered the bbq chicken. It was very good and tasty and i wish that I lived closer I would eat here regularly. 

The best part was the fact that they put pickles on every thing. But I don't eat pickles."}
{"text":"Triple d came here????? oh my word it was horrible! From the neighbor\"HOOD\" in which it was located to the car hops being recruited from homeless shelters this place is definitely not worth returning to. If you choose to ignore my advice bring your gun I don't think the armed guard shows up until 8pm and try the onion rings they are the best thing I ate."}
{"text":"I found this place as a result of Triple D's and since I passed it a few times on my way to and from the airport I had to make the Stop...  and it was worth wild.

First off, this is truly a Drive In with limited counter space inside(really none) and a couple of stools. But true to their southern hospitality, if you walk in, they'll fix you a place to sit.

The crispy fried chicken dip in the house's spicy barbecue sauce was outstanding. The pulled pork came in a close second complemented  with the outstanding onion rings. I'll have to say the hush puppies need a little work as they arrived cold.

Cold hush puppy or not, the BBQ driving is a taste of culinary yesteryear and worth the trip. It's probably best to do parked curbside from the comforts of your car."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by Guy Fieri.  He does not know everything.  I, like so many others before me, was duped by a TV show making things look better than they are.  I've said before that I'm not a huge BBQ fan, but this place was pretty underwhelming overall.  Nothing special about anything, IMO.  And I was furious about having to get out of my car to hit up the ATM to pay for my food.  And the car hop literally said to me \"Yo, I get a tip?\".  Sure, I guess, if you're going to bully me into it.  It was ok, but I'd rather save myself the hassle and hit up Hilbilly's if I ever get another BBQ craving."}
{"text":"I like this place, it is a fun throwback to old school diners you see on TV where people sit in their cars and have people bring the food to them. You can also go inside.

Service was good, the waiter/car hopper guy seemed to be a little confused as he didn't appear to understand our order and he even forgot one of the items we ordered but other than that he was nice a friendly.

I ordered the dozen fried shrimp with french fries, fries and shrimp were both cooked beautifully.   Shrimp were a quality size and met my needs to fill me up. Shrimp batter was seasoned well and added to the flavor of the shrimp.  Fries were also nice and crisp and warm.  My one issue is they don't give you much tater sauce to meet the size of the shrimp they provide.

Cash only sucks, I mean who has cash nowadays but so not a big deal because they have an ATM inside you can use.

Overall definitely worth a visit if you're in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Not the worlds greatest BBQ chicken (sorry Guy). It was good. Very vinegary. Second price got soggy and the crust is only good when crisp. If I am back down in that area I will try the regular fried chicken.One thing that really bothered me what the car hop hovering for a tip."}
{"text":"I don't know maybe it was a bad night I went on. The place is original to car hops from back in the day. Prices ok. Not like super cheap but the menu has variety. The food was homestyle, bland, and majority of plates are fried. Sweet tea...terrible.
They do accept debit and keep a crowd. 
I'll try again in time and choose a different platter."}
{"text":"Food here was pretty decent. The coleslaw and beans were my favorite. Coleslaw was on the sweeter side, as was the bbq pork. The bbq pork was ok. Will try their fried chicken next time so i can write a better review."}
{"text":"I stopped in here while on a road trip because I saw it on Triple D. I love BBQ and southern BBQ is one of my personal favorites so I was super excited to check this joint out.

Sadly, the condition of the facility, the payment process and the food left me feeling so so about this place. 

The drive up lot is huge and there are plenty of stations to order food at. However, many of the stations were run down and dirty.  I think they could improve buy cleaning them up and replacing old equipment.

The payment process is whack. Bring cash, unless of course you don't mind someone taking your credit card and walking away with it to ring you up. They should do it at your window as the technology is not that expensive.

The food was a saving grace. The pulled pork sandwich and hush puppies were downright slammin.  I'll be honest, it seemed liked it was hitting every tastebud just the right way.  I could have 10 of each!!!  This is comfort food at its finest.

I'd come back but only because the food is really good."}
{"text":"When traveling we often try to visit restaurants that have been on Dives, Dinners and Drive-Ins.  As we sat in the car deciding what to order David came out to the car to see if we needed any help.
Next thing we know we were sitting at a small table inside getting the royal treatment!  The food was amazing, onion rings that we dipped in their BBQ sauce (per David's recommendation- WOW!) homemade hush puppies, pulled pork and fried chicken soaked in BBQ sauce!!!!
We left with full bellies and happy hearts, what a fun experience it was!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at BBQ king since I can remember, being like most westsiders. I really love their PoBoys, crushed ice in their sweet tea, homemade onion rings like no one else and even their trout plate and tartar sauce. The best part about visiting the king, as we call it,  is the workers. They always recognize their regulars with a friendly hello. And to the person who said their tea was too small, refills are free if you walk inside."}
{"text":"What can you say...it's an institution and you don't go changing a classic like this. Pork sandwiches, Chicken, fries and Onion rings are the best and don't forget the cherry lemon Sundrop."}
{"text":"This place was featured a while back on Drive Ins, Diners and Dives on The Food Network - the show with Guy Fieri driving up to places in a convertible. It is a 50's throw back drive in with curb service in a somewhat scary part of town. You call in your order on this antiquated system -  it is kind of cool, but hard to understand the person taking the order.

They serve all the usual drive in items with the addition of minced Pork Barbecue and some of the most unusual Barbecue Chicken you'll every try - it is fried first, and then dipped in a tangy barbecue sauce. This method is used by Keaton's in Cleveland, NC, Ted's Famous Chicken on S. Main  in Winston Salem, and Bar-B-Q King's neighbor down Wilkerson Blvd.,Town & Country Drive In.

The Barbecued Chicken is good, the sauce tangy, but not especially hot. The pork barbecue is ok, but a little too finely chopped for my taste. The hot dogs, hamburgers, and onion rings are all really good. The service is generally fast. This place is worth a visit, and if you visit you gotta try the chicken.

 No credit cards accepted here."}
{"text":"CLOSED!!  Shut down, empty, locked!! We went out of our way to go and try this place because I saw this on diners, drive-ins and dives and I just saw this again in October guide for places to eat and they're advertising it there as well. I wish somebody would get their shit straight and do their research before sending people on a Wild good chase!!"}
{"text":"Food was meh. People behind the counter were not very friendly - very courteous but all business - no smiles. I didn't realize that it was ONLY drive up - no place to sit and eat - had to take my food with me to go to the airport so in fairness - probably was somewhat part of why the food was only OK tasting. It came highly recommended so maybe I just had a fluke experience."}
{"text":"If you crave some greasey spoon food at a drive-in style spot not near anything, this is your place. Once or twice a year is fine by me"}
{"text":"I am a big fan in trying dives and this was a dive. Not a good Olympic dive, like a ten foot deep pool with three feet of water in it dive. The food was tasteless and greasy. I love fried chicken and go out of my way to stop and get good fried chicken. This was a very disappointing visit. Service was great but food was less than mediocre. Guy might want to re-review this one as it was not worthy of DDD seal."}
{"text":"As seen on TV!   This place has an authentic feel to it as the owner of the business comes out to greet you and really talks up his place.  The BBQ is tender and the sauce is mildly spicy.  Good home cooked ff and hush puppies with slaw that compliments the bbq nicely!   Yum!  I'll be back here again and again!"}
{"text":"Driving up to the place, you contemplate if you should have brought your bullet proof vest. You pull in, see that nothing has been touched since 1950, and fall into deep thought about the greatness that's going to enter your mouth. You look at the menu (with taped over prices) and order through the original Alexander Graham Bell phone. Can't understand what the lady is saying back to you? WHO CARES!! 

All you need to do is order the BBQ Minced sandwich and a 1/4 BBQ chicken (white meat). Yeah, some people say the sandwich could have more BBQ sauce on it, but those people need to walk out onto Wilkinson with their eyes closed.

You won't find another place like this in the world, i promise...I've looked. The people that work there make this place especially unique. The guys are funny, quick, and they were shirts with holes in them.

Overall, if you are in Charlotte, you better go there. Make sure you bring Cash with you because Credit Cards are not allowed."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Bar-B-Q King.  The weather was pretty nice so it was a good day for a drive in.  I always try to keep an open mind when eating at a place for the first time which can be tough after reading reviews about the place.  I ordered BBQ plate which comes with 2 sides.  I got fries and slaw.  My visit was on a Saturday between noon and 1 pm.  The place seemed pretty busy with about 50% of the stalls occupied.  It took a little while to get my food, but not so long as to start thinking, \"where is my food.\"  The server dropped my tray off and quickly moved on the the next car without getting my money.  Odd, but probably the most efficient.  The pork was minced with sauce on it.  The slaw was also minced rather than being shredded.  There was also a sandwich bun along with the fries.  I was able to get some pork without sauce to try first.  The pork was moist and tender, but very bland.  I then tried some of the pork with the sauce and the sauce was bland too.  There was no smoke flavor at all.  The fries were good, fluffy on the inside, but not quite crisp enough.  The slaw was crunchy and fresh, but it too was bland.  I don't really care about the sauce.  Tastes vary and some like it spicier than others.  But the pork although being tender and moist was disappointing.  Overall it wasn't a bad meal, but it wasn't good either.  Again there are better places to go for much better BBQ."}
{"text":"The food here used to be good, but like the side of town its on, it has gone down hill. I would not feel comfortable eating here at night without my friends Smith & Wesson with me.
Its an old style 50's drive in where you order at your car and car hops bring the food. The last time I ate here the BBQ was greasy and had no smokey flavor. What really turned me off about the place was the car hops. They look like drug dealers standing on a street corner with large wads of cash in their hands.
 The last time I ate here, I took my Mom for lunch one day. The bill came to $12. I gave the car hop $15 and told him to keep the change. He just looked at me in disgust and just turned around and walked away with out so much as a thank you or anything. As he walked away, I loudly said \"Your Welcome!\" He just kept walking away muttering something under his breath, probably cussin' me!
 What the Hell? I gave him a 25% tip. What did he think he deserved 50%? More? I don't think so, especially after the way he acted, I wished I had not given him a damn dime!
That's okay, because Bar-B-Q King will never see me again! I'll spend my hard earned money where the food and service are much better."}
{"text":"Did you read my tip?! Good *** BBQ?!  Haha, I was being totally sarcastic.  IT'S GOOD IF YOU LIKE \"ass\" BBQ!  

First of all, the wait time before anyone serviced us was long and the place wasn't that busy.  Second, it's cash only, so that put me in a bind because it's BLACK FRIDAY and I wasn't going outside for anything, not even the bank...and on that note, I must digress because I was bamboozled into coming to this dump by that oompa loompa, Guy Fieri, on DDD!! Third, the waiter had the audacity to ask for his tip! Are you that thirsty for cash, my brotha?!  Maybe I was digging for it in my car cushions because your establishment doesn't take debit/credit cards?!

Here's a tip: Don't eat here unless you like good \"ASS\" BBQ (unless you're into that sort of thing).  The chicken was \"meh\", the sauce was too watered down and spicy, and the wait staff was incredibly rude.  I really don't know why this place was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives...."}
{"text":"Honestly - I've been chasing the \"BBQ Fever\" here in Charlotte for a little over a year now. This joint did not disappoint. 

Can you say full immersion vintage- this place looks like someone literally left it untouched since the mid 60's or 70's. It was awesome. An absolute drive in- you and dozens of other cars rally yourself's in spaces hoping to get close enough the first time to press the button on the intercom to order. Again - Awesome. 

The menu was a bit difficult to navigate at first.... the burgers are situated directly in the middle - so you can be swayed to ordering ( not what they are famous for) 

The BBQ Plate- The BBQ Dinner either one is downright amazing. 

Because I am not a big BBQ pulled pork person - I opted for the BBQ Chicken... and its just plain fantastic!!! Its fried and splattered with a tangy home style BBQ sauce. The best of both worlds.. fried chicken  and BBQ sauce in one deal.  

The sides paired well. the coleslaw had a nice bite and crunch (although it got stuck to the bottom of the cup and I couldn't finish it) HUSH PUPPIES were huge and they were so dang flavorful... I seriously will be back !!!

I also had a Chocolate Shake.... they has missed the boat on this one..."}
{"text":"What a great place! We were taking pics and one of the guys came out and told use to go over here and over here and inside for the best pictures, then suggested the BBQ combo plate. The BBQ dipped fried chicken was OUTSTANDING! the sauce is very vinigery and I am not a fan of that, but this had just enough bite from and spicyness. This is a place not to wear fancy clothes, because you will spill the deliciousness on you! From the outside this place does not look like much, but with a great staff and food, it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"YUM...this is a charlotte classic! :) great fast drive-in old school food. hear their fried chicken is amazing. i always get a burger and fries and some of their delightfully delish onion rings!! they also make cherry lemon sundrop which my boyfriend is very greatful for ... really yummy, all the car hops are super nice and quick! dont forget to tip! :) this place doesnt take credit cards but inside they have an atm.."}
{"text":"Decided to give BBQ King a try after seeing it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. I was really wanting to like this place. It looked cool on the show and the fried BBQ chicken was supposed to be the best. Complete failure the moment we arrived. I pressed the button on the 1950s speaker system to order and the lady snapped on the other side was about as rude as rude gets. \"I can't hear you\" in a rude hateful voice. I wondered if I was in Charlotte or NYC. I had to contain myself from pulling her through that speaker system. Wow lady, the speaker system is from the 50s, no wonder you couldn't hear me. What I wanted was a BBQ fried chicken sandwich, but what I got was BBQ grilled tenders sandwich. Meat was too salty and the hush puppies were just ok, nothing good. Def won't be going back."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp offered half stars.

After trying many acclaimed restaurants featured on the food network, I've come up with a conclusion. The food at many of these restaurants kinda sucks.  They don't want to offend the restaurant, so they give good praise. In reality, the food isn't that great. It seems they are only featured because they are a staple in that community, unique or has some type of significant history. I respect that though. 

I like BBQ king for being all of those things, but the food is mediocre. BBQ was not smoky at all. No flavor. I don't think it's even really smoked. I am no connoisseur, but I know this isn't good Q. 

Regular fried chicken is good. The fried chicken dipped in BBQ is nice. Something new, not my cup of tea, but if I grew up on it, I surely would understand. Service and Cheeseburgers are good though. And most importantly, very affordable."}
{"text":"What I LOVE:

*Onion Rings
*Cherry Lemon Sprite
*BBQ Fried Chicken

Down home good eats. Seriously some of the best \"fast food\" you can get. The food is delicious. The BBQ fried chicken is my favorite because it still retains some of the crispiness from the fried goodness and the bbq wins me over. It is tangy and vinegary with just a tinge of sweetness and delicious spice.

The onion rings are crunchy with nice big pieces of onion on the inside. 

The Cherry Lemon Sprite is the business. I am not a big soda fan but this will blow your mind. It is just delicious and I MUST have this every time we eat here.

To be honest, I haven't been disappointed with anything I have ate here. From the mentioned to rib eye sandwich plate to the sliced pork bbq sandwich.

Just do it. Enjoy it and I promise you will not be mad at yourself."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best chicken I've ever tasted. They fry the chicken first, then coat it in their sauce. Amazing! It's unorthodox because it's a drive up but the speakers don't work, so you'll have a dude without a store shirt on come up and take your order. And the area is kinda rough, especially when the sun goes down. But suck it up and don't wear something nice. You will get messy."}
{"text":"A piece of Charlotte history.
The BBQ is good, maybe not the best.
I kinda compare the local que to Kyle Flethcers in Gastonia.
This is alright but not quite Kyle style.

The days of the drive-in or waning.
Go here for the experience before it's gone."}
