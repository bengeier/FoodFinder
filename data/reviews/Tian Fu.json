{"text":"4.5 stars. This is really good Sichuan style Chinese food. I tried some classic dishes, which for me, usually serve as a good benchmark. I had Gong Bao chicken (aka Imperial / Kung Pao) $11, Pickled mustard greens with fish ($14) and Stir-fried green beans ($10). They all tasted great and if you like spicy then you'll like this restaurant. All these dishes were spicy, particularly the pickled mustard greens with fish if you accidentally eat one of the peppers. This is a water boiled dish so you get a mixture of pepper and sour flavors in the soup. The Gong Bao chicken had the sichuan peppercorns and stir fried hot peppers. A very solid version that balanced the sweetness with the spiciness. It's very saucy so it goes great with rice. You can get this with shrimp instead of chicken. Stir-fried green beans came with minced pork and it was excellent. Surprisingly it might have been my favorite of the three dishes and I hate vegetables.

Very good portions for the price. My takeout order was cooked quite quickly on Saturday around lunch time. Credit card is accepted. I don't know if this is the best Sichuan Chinese restaurant in Brossard but I would bet it's one of the best. I would not hesitate to go back whenever I'm in the area. The restaurant itself has pretty nice decor with a fair amount of space and seems to have opened recently."}
{"text":"Good portion and reasonable price. Most important, it tastes good. Fast/courteous service.
I have tried other dishes too but haven't got the photos.
Best Chinese food in Brossard for the moment."}
{"text":"The food was really good and portion size is pretty big worth the menu price. The decorations inside is pretty nice matches their food not like a used old restaurant. I highly recommend the restaurant. 
Just a friendly advice you leave smelling like the restaurant, because they cook with with degree oil. Without that oil smell the food won't be as good. So don't wear your work clothes to eat there!!"}
{"text":"Not legit but still edible. If you are looking for good spicy schezuan dishes, this is not the place for you"}
{"text":"Yeah nice new good Chinese (Sichuan) place with nice decor. 

The fish with pickled cabbage is really good. The fried spicy chicken was Ok, but not really spicy enough, so that's sad for me. The beef and beef tripe was ok.

Will be back to try other stuff."}
