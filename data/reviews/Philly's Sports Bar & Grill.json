{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and we wanted to watch the Dodger vs. Cubs game and this place was great. There must be about 15 big screen TV's on the walls and then each booth has its' own TV, about 19 inch monitor. Our waitress, very attentive and friendly got our drinks quickly and took the food order. The beer on tap was very cold for each order, great job! We got a large pizza, no problems here. The place was about 90% full, so our food and drinks came in a very timely manner. If you are in the area and want to watch a game and have a beer, this is the place!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and were looking for a place to watch the World Cup. This place was perfect. A screen at our table and big screens all around. Beer selection was great and service was awesome. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Friendly waitress. Very reasonable prices. Good sliders and excellent garlic fries. Reasonable happy hour wine for a sports bar. Each table has its own tv so you can choose what to watch. Walking distance from the Doubletree Tempe."}
{"text":"I live right down the street, saw the \"NOW OPEN\" signs and had to try it.  I was greeted by a really friendly waitress and pretty much had the choice of any table in the joint since I went there at 10PM on a Monday.  I had never eaten there before so the waitress recommended the Philly Cheese Steak and Waffle fries.  I picked the \"Original\" which came with onions and whiz.  I think it was like 10 bucks for a footlong.  I would give a rating of A+ because their Philly Cheesesteak  GPA is definitely above a 4.0.  Hot whiz, tender steak, soft bread, the best waffle fries around, and you cant forget the pepperochinis.  Pair that with an ice cold Kiltlifter or Hanger 24 (a Blue Moon analog that is IMHO 50x better than BM) and you have a recipe for a delicious experience that will blow Corleones out of the water.  As for the sports bar part of it, they had like 10 TVs around the bar showing a nice variety of shows (Barrett Jackson, CNN, Basketball Games etc.) as well as personal screens at most of the booths.  I really hope their business picks up because they hooked me on the first try.  I will definitely be going back to Philly's to get my cheesesteak on."}
{"text":"Our office just moved into the area, and I was looking for a decent place to have lunch with a friend and her new baby. Based on another friend's recommendation, we gave Philly's a try. It was nice and quiet for a Friday afternoon (perfect with a baby in tow!), our food was delivered quickly and hot. The service was excellent, and our waitress was very friendly. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich with a side of waffle fries. The sandwich was okay, the chicken was a tad dry, but not so bad I didn't finish most of it! I'd definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"Coldest beer in town! Frosty bottles that quench your thirst in the AZ heat! Brag about this place to al my friends. Although I didn't try the food yet the menu looks great."}
{"text":"Very poor service, we asked for a towel to wipe the dust off the table and left after she didn't come back for 20 minutes. Place seems like they ran out of money, to be honest. Cheesesteak was about the only thing good at that place.. Very sad."}
{"text":"We went twice, first time the service was crappy but the pulled pork Philly was good enough to warrant ten bucks. The second time the service was amazing but the chili mac was a travesty. Is it a thing now that all mac and cheese is now nacho cheese sauce on some noodles? Neat little place, I hope next time the food and service match up and it's good."}
{"text":"Everything started great. As soon as bartender realized I was routing for opposing team I got cut off. Absolutely insane. The black dude was the bartender. Which was a dick from the moment I walked in. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I know. If you want a good environment to watch a game there are plenty of other places to go around the area. Would never recommend phillys to anyone"}
{"text":"It's been 15 minutes and I finally got my menu...  The worst part is that it seems pretty calm and not full at all. Really disappointing and quite rude.  Id hate to come on the weekend. Someone send Bar Rescue!!!!"}
{"text":"Gave this Philly's on Priest a second chance just to make sure our first experience was a fluke. We shouldn't have! Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and the meat was inedible. Tough, grizzly, chewy and not even cut up. Showed the waitress our masterpiece of a sandwich and she said they had a new cook. What?? How does that effect the quality of the meat??  She gave us a whopping 20% discount for not throwing it on the floor! We paid and left vowing to never return.  The other two Philly's locations on Warner and Scottsdale Avenue are no problem. This one?? Wow! Get it together."}
{"text":"Have had the philly twice now.  It is pretty good. Not the best in town but up there.  Nice atmosphere with lots of screens for sports.  Get the onion rings, they are very good."}
{"text":"My business partner and I eat and drink here regularly. We have tried many different items on the menu and haven't found a bad dish yet. The staff is friendly and the venue is perfect for casual dining/ bar seen. Strongly recommend this place to any one in the area!"}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak was to die for! I was impressed with the service and would recommend anyone go here... Only get the managers special if you like super hot food."}
{"text":"Good service. Sometimes it's hit and miss with service but it's been consistent lately. Lots of Tv's and TV at booths. Food is ok. Nothing really stands out. But good atmosphere and have an enjoyable experience when I go."}
{"text":"Great local dive bar. If you are a football fan they always have the games on. Highly recommend this place if your looking for a chill place to drink."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Check out the prime rib on Sunday"}
{"text":"Nice and new on the inside. Server was super nice. We went for happy hour where most apps are $4 and pints are $3. Great beer selection. The bacon cheese fries were delicious. They have lots of TV's and a pool table."}
{"text":"Decided to give this local spot a chance. Nice and clean bar/restaurant, look over the menu and notice regular bar food. Wings, burgers, sandwiches. Was pleasantly surprised to see a chili burger was on the menu. Bartender was very pleasant and welcoming. About 15 mins have passed and the bartender reassured me the burger would be out soon. About 20 mins for a burger I think took too long. Was hungry and excited to dog in. First impression, square plate like a upscale dinning restaurant but who cares hopefully the chili burger will taste as good as the plate looks. Onto the food, there was no bun, it look like wheat toast. No onion as I requested so that good. First bite and no flavor, beans tasted like they were out of a can. Fry's were over salted. I was so hungry, I just ate the burger because I had to go to work. I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for another burger."}
{"text":"The past few MNF games service has really improved! Food is quick, servers are great, and the experience is much better. The Monday special is a great meal for a good deal."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I am far from disgruntled, I didn't have a miserable experience, but the 4.5+ stars this place gets is SUPER misleading. It couldn't hit 3 stars if its existence depended on it.   It's a clean place. Very sports bar-ish. Nothing out of the ordinary. TV's at every table and a million more on the walls. Expected.   Service was quick and the waitress was a doll! Service was absolutely flawless.   It was the food. It was so awful as to be a afterthought here. It's like, hey, if we put enough TV's in here we won't have to serve anything edible; just beer and football! No.   Ordered the queso without the meat and some chips. The cheese was so coagulated that it was almost chewy lumpy. My mouth completely rebelled. It was also freaking spicy, which they don't mention. Thankfully I ate first because my date hates spicy. I caught it in time so he didn't have to suffer the fate of eating this non-food THING. The chips were...uh, stale? I mean, tasted like cardboard, I mean, didn't have any taste, were not crunchy, but not stale. They were alien.   Entrees coming up. I got the fish and chips. Uhm. Hmmmm. Fries were tasteless (recurring theme here), fish was sqaure. Deeply deep fried. Super crispy. The fish oddly didn't fit into it's hard outer shell. I have no idea how they did that. I was fascinated. The serving was also super stingy. Just don't do this. Or, eat at your own risk.   My date had the Philly cheesesteak, which I'm going to go ahead and say was terrible. I don't eat meat, but I can't imagine his resembled food any more than anything else. I dare you to try it for yourself, though.  This place is shockingly bad. It doesn't have an authentic feel, it's not that great. I have no idea where all those stars came from. Maybe they bought them from the star store. Maybe they should work on earning them. Bad. Avoid."}
{"text":"So. Many. Flies. Service wasn't great, couldn't seem to remember anything we asked for.   Also, you shouldn't be able to bend chips without them breaking..."}
{"text":"Cold beer, really good food. The cheesesteak sandwich made by someone who knew what they were doing. Surrounded by big TVs. Nothing not to like here."}
{"text":"Went here to see UFC 193. The place was over crowded, they ran out of drinks our group wanted and the doormen were very rude. Didn't take cards for the cover charge so that was annoying. This place might be alright if the people here weren't so terrible."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend a few years ago and we keep coming back. I was kind of hesitant about it at first. It looks like a typical bar with mediocre food. So imagine to my surprise when we had the house wings and they were this super awesome garlic flavor, the waitress recommended them to be double dipped (extra crispy we found out). We also had the pizza and it wasn't all soft and greasy. The pizza crust was crisp and buttery and the toppings didn't grease it out. I haven't had them yet, but says the tacos are pretty good too. They have a happy hour special every day from 3 to 7pm. It's a great place to grab and beer and wings."}
{"text":"Adrienne is the best! She went above and beyond my expectations. Hand stuffing olives for my martini because they ran out. Amazing little sports bar with low key casual vibe. Great staff and yummy fried pickles."}
{"text":"This used to be a couple of different bars, but the new ownership has a hit here! I work right down the street so this place has been the \"after work with friends\" place for quite a while.  I had to get to a TV lately right after work to watch my favorite BB team. This time however, the bartenders were very friendly. The beer selection is very good with all the national pours, a few local taps and 2 rotating taps. I have always found an IPA I loved!  So, I got hungry. They have a happy-hour menu that includes the usual items so I got some 'skins and wings. They have like a hundred wing combinations so I got a dry rub spicy. So they come out and the 'skins were just awesome! Loaded with some pulled pork and their own spicy BBQ sauce. I was surprised and impressed. The wings were crisp and tasty.   I'm not sure what upped the ante here but I have been back regularly since. I think they must have an experienced chef making the tasty treats. For a sports bar with good well-lit seating and 20 some odd Tvs (with two patio eating/viewing areas) the quality of the food is surprising and welcome.  I think you should go there!"}
{"text":"TELEVISIONS ON EACH TABLE. They have great philly steak sandwichs and great french fried potatoes. The service is on spot. So come on by cool off have a ice cold beer and a cheese steak sandwich smothered in onions. Getting hungry"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Food.. meh. Good amount of beer selection and great happy hour price."}
{"text":"I stop in here when I am in town for happy hour, a few drinks and wings. The bartenders are nice and the food is good. Plenty of TV's to watch sports. Outdoor patio and fire pit for cold nights. No smoking inside but you can on the patio. There is a second location I visited in Scottsdale but I like this location best."}
{"text":"The food and drinks and service is wonderful. Phil and Brittany are great! The steak with Mike sauce was wonderful. The margurita pizza was the best. The happy hour prices are great."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this. I am always on the lookout for good sports bars. It stinks that this place may not be the place because I can walk to it from work. Went in on a Wednesday for lunch. Sat at the bar for a few minutes and ordered a drink and got the menu. Got my drink fairly quick. Avg amount of time for the bartender to come back and get my food order. So far so..average. But I'm happy. Been there prob 10 min total and ordered a salad. 30 minutes later!!! Bartender tells me due to a large party(was there before me) your salad will take another 20+ minutes?! It took you 30 min to realize this when they were already there before I was?! I tell her I can't wait and she tells me maybe I can still get some Jack in the Box. Cancels my salad and then hands me a bill for my $4 drink. What?! I then hear another server tell the other bar tops that the large party is in every Wednesday so don't come on Wednesdays. New people are being sat with no heads up either! Holy @$#@$^#@#^!!!!! Who is running this place?! Besides getting my drink right, I'm not sure I can put my finger on anything else positive, hence the review.  Moral of the story, NEVER go to Philly's on a Wednesday I guess. Unless out of options, I won't be back any day."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this bar fool you, it's super nice and new on the inside.  I check out most bars when they first open.  Fantastic reverse happy hour, Sunday through Thursday.  The apps were delicious and cheap, as were the drinks!  There's mini TVs at every table so it would be a great place to watch a game.  Servers were nice and attentive, no complaints at all!"}
{"text":"The food is mostly bar food, but it's really delicious bar food. Happy Hour is from 4-7pm every day! There are TVs every where--even in the booths with your own remote. There is also a pool table and dart board. Plus the servers are super nice! This is place is definitely worth a try. :)"}
{"text":"Food: - Chicken teriyaki Sandwich: grilled chicken breast covered with teriyaki sauce, topped with a slice of pineapple, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and red onions. The sandwich was messy but tasty. I bit into a piece of chicken bone. I'm glad I didn't choke on it. 4/5 - Onions rings: tasty, crunchy, and plenty. 4/5   Service: I came at lunch time and was immediately greeted and seated. My waitress was friendly. She stopped by my table a couple times to check on my food. 4/5  Final thoughts: I would definitely come back.  Good food, good environment. There's also a fully stocked bar and pool tables."}
{"text":"Wicked place - allows dogs on patio. Place has great management and servers/bartenders are awesome! Cool spot to grab a beer or so and a bite. Recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good. Last time went there was a screw in my food, this time I had to wait 20 minutes for a MENU!   terrible service"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Waitress was friendly and my beer was i e cold . Also great place to see a game lots of TVs."}
{"text":"3 stars is what I can give for now. Stopped by this weekend for two drinks and a noch. Ordered the cheese bread and a vodka press. The bartender,  I believe his name was bill, was very friendly and good at his job. That said, he poured a terrible drink, by far less than the usual 1.25 ounces in a normal cocktail.  The grub was pretty tasty, with a solid amount of cheese and the marinara was better than most places.   Teach your employees a proper pour and you might get the stars you deserve."}
{"text":"Great place, good outside seating, pool tables lots of TV's. Brittany our bartender was amazing even though she had a really rough night stuck at an airport only to get home 2 hours before her shift, she pulled it off with a great attitude.. We had the wings and cauliflower crust pizza bot were good. The locals were talkative and friendly, we love that. They are known for their Philly's and burgers, we only we're having appetizers, so next time we will try them."}
{"text":"I had heard the wings were good. I had the dry rub Cajun variety. Meh! They had this type of chili there tho that made it all worth it. I had two bowls. Great stuff. Typical pub food here. Good atmosphere. Tvs at tables. Great staff. My rating is based solely on one visit. Take with grain of salt. Would go again. Just won't get dry rub wings this time."}
{"text":"Cheese steaks are my favorite and im aleays looking for a new food one this place is close to me so i was excited about it,. i would say the service was terrible but it was basically non existant. it took the waitress twenty minutes to ask us for our order after we had already gotten drinks, mine had like no ice and it took us finding her just to order it. Heres the kicker she had no other tables. Then it took another twenty minutes just to get the french frys we asked for as appetizers. My glass of coke is still empty and its been an hour and we still havent gotten our meal. Im currently thinking about just walking out and grabbing it somewhere else.   If your a football fan you may appreciate the screaming fans over a lame college game. Tigers fans apparently. I wouldnt have expected people and kids running and literally screaming in the dining area when there is a seperate bar area. Niw a bunch of people are in a chant to the marching band. screaming  I had been writing this as we were sitting and screw this place we just walked out  The good  Crab style french frys are really good"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had a good time each visit. It's decked out with TV's any direction you face. The service is great... well maybe I should say the service is tops, because this place and its attractive service staff put Hooters to shame. So, if you are looking for pretty good eats in a loud sporty atmosphere, BUST on over.   I was going to go with 4 stars because I have had pretty damn good experiences both visits. But last night I tried the Cheesesteak and it was sub par. So, currently Philly's is getting docked 1 star. I'm hoping on my next visit I can adjust this review to return that star. I like this place.  I ordered the Three Topping Philly with great anticipation. It goes for $9.50 and is described as: \"Grilled with white American cheese and three toppings of your choice (mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, jalapeños or cherry peppers). I got it with onions, bell peppers, and jalapeños.\"  If your place is called Philly's, your Philly Cheesesteak should be a house specialty served to perfection with pride.   My Three Topping Philly was way off game in that it was dry with very little cheese. The two critical, signature ingredients of a cheesesteak were way off. And I was sad.  :(   I could tell if those aspects had been up to par, the sandwich would have been outstanding... the meat had a good taste, but Man it was dry.   So, how little cheese was on it you ask? Well, there was not enough cheese to bind the meat together to prevent it from falling out of the sandwich each time I picked it up for a bite.   I'm looking forward to a moist Three Topping Philly with cheese throughout the meat on my next visit."}
{"text":"Mmm, try the buffalo chicken wrap. It's cheesy with a little spice, but not over the top. Pairs well with a Peach ale, if I do say so myself! Their fried pickles are pretty effing delicious, too. As well as the onion rings. Hey, you had me at \"fried.\"   Bartenders Megen and Chelsie are awesome! :)   I really like their daily deals as well."}
{"text":"3 Stars for the ladies! Great happy hour!!  Service until 5:45 was great. Then it sucked! Bring in the lady bartenders! Much better svc than you the 2 clown guys. All they were about was chest bumpin and jacking around! 0 stars for them! Stars 0"}
{"text":"Great menu with reasonable prices and a friendly, responsive staff.  Their happy hour is pretty decent too."}
{"text":"Overpriced! , very clean restaurant and friendly staff was a plus ! They have individual TVs at the booth that was pretty awesome our remote didn't work though (not too bothered by that i came to eat not watch TV anyways ) ...... fast forward to the cheesesteak sandwich ... it was okay .... that's why I'm giving this place the rating I'm giving it , a friend and myself split a 12\" sub . . We had Two house salads (no meat or anything special added to it ) , and 2 drinks which came out to 40$ ?? . Mediocre food but great service:) Wish they'd make it more mom friendly but it's a sports bar for a reason lol ..."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed!!  It took our waitress to even acknowledge us 20 minutes and then after 50 minutes we walked out!! We only had an hour for lunch and we had to rush to grab McDs to bring to eat at our desks!  Why did you spend the extra money for your patio and not in hiring better more attentive staff!  Bummer word of mouth is huge!!"}
{"text":"Great social local football bar. Always enjoy the Sunday football specials. Macy is a fun and friendly bartender. Make sure to give her kudos for her great service."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on this place. My husband and I got up and left after standing at the door for a few minutes. Piss poor service,especially if your not Caucasian. You don't deserve the star I had select."}
{"text":"excellent food, wonderful service and inside was nice and cool, definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From the outside, it doesn't look like much. I'll admit that I have driven by this place nearly every day going to and from work. One day, I decided to try it... and was pleasantly surprised!  It looks like they recently remodeled the place, and the interior was pretty nice. The food was really good! Nice portion sizes and well-prepared. I got the mushroom swiss burger, and the beef was seasoned nicely and cooked to my liking. The waitress was very friendly and personable.  Overall, I'd definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop here today like we have in the past. We had left another local bar due to lack of service, we drove out of our way to go to Philly's.  As usual always great food and great service!! This place has fresh delicious salads, burgers to my favorites pork nachos are really good! Staff here is always prompt, checks in on us  consistently and down to earth. We were here about 2:45 pm today and got a later lunch. I state this if management or the owners read this. I want everyone to know they are the best and you can't get better than that."}
{"text":"I stopped into Philly's for lunch. Food was good service was good bartender was friendly. The music that the bartender was playing was so offensive, fuck this, fuck you, fuck me, fuck up, fuck around, fuck fuck fuck fuck, Knigge this Knigge that Knigge Knigge Knigge eat me out fuck my puss... are you kidding? I've never been so offended. I can't speak for the elderly couple that were sitting next to me but the looks they were giving each other said it's own. If you wonder why you don't have any lunch service this is the reason."}
{"text":"Really good lobby bar. Great staff and amazing empanadas. Also get the handmade mudslide its to die for."}
{"text":"I was just passing through town (staying up the street) and looking for a place to eat. The music was great. The atmosphere was awesome, and the bartender was really cool also. We ended up staying late and playing the golf arcade they had. I wish I had a place like this near me."}
{"text":"Had the original Philly - it was delicious! The only reason for 4 stars is because waffle fries came out cold. Service was very quick."}
{"text":"I go here all the time for the same thing and mainly sit at the same booth. A couple times I had the same waitress. The tomatoes have not been good lately, so i point it out to the waitress when i leave. I always leave a really good tip. Today the waitress forgot she talked to me, i waited and someone came by and asked if i had been helped. Then i get the salad and again the tomatoes are bad along with the core piece of the salad head. I told her that the tomatoes were bad and she says, i know all the produce had been so spotty lately at the stores, since the change in government!! Then says, because of building the wall. So i left her a 2.00 tip for my salad."}
{"text":"I went there today for lunch. Very pleasant people there. I was so impressed with the little cute girl who I was told was the boss. Very nice, she spoke to everyone. I told her when I left how she was very pleasant and great for the bar. I'm from out of town and she made us all feel like we were regulars. I could have been in cheers or something. That's how comfortable she made us. I don't know how the bar was before but I would recommend anyone to go there. Not just for great people, but great food as well."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Had to bus our own tables, food never entered in the POS, and 30 mins to get drinks. Leaving and looking for a new bar!"}
{"text":"Don't go here on a Wednesday night. Just walked out after waiting 30 minutes just for someone to take our drink order and 45 minutes without even getting our appetizer. Asked to cash out on our drinks and cancel our food order and never once was apologized to or given an explanation for the horrible service."}
{"text":"Good food and a lot of fun right before the ASU football game. Kim was a great waitress and even comped our appetizer because we got it the same time as our meals."}
{"text":"Went here a a couple days ago. The server couldn't seem to pay attention to anyone who wasn't a male customer. Our food took half an hour, and then I heard her say she almost forgot about it entirely and she had to rush it in the kitchen. Ordered a vodka redbull (should literally be the easiest thing) and it tasted like shit. Maybe it was the ice/ water quality, but still. Then asked for a mtn dew instead. She got the drink, and sat it on the bar about 4 ft from me, like I was supposed to either reach and grab it or wait for her, so I just stood up walked over and got it myself. Server's boyfriend then came in and we didn't see her after that. Left cash because she didn't give us a bill because she was talking to friends and sitting down. Suuuper not impressed, even for a sports bar."}
{"text":"I have this place 3 visits before I wrote this. The fact I have come here 3 times in a row says something all in it self. They bar staff take the time to learn your name. The drinks are fairly priced. The employees are all nice and make a point to get to know you. The beer is cold. The good is good and hot. Typical bar food. The mixers strong. And the person next to you is not afraid to say hi.  I have been impressed with Phillys and if ever back in Tempe, will for sure be back here. Would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good when it comes to happy hour after a long day of work. The environment is cool, they have tons of tv's with games, and also a juke box with great music. The servers are very friendly, drinks are good and also the food."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. We had the fajitas and the cheese steak. First of all the fajitas were not thin cut and the meat was very tough.  The cheesesteak was dry and the bread seemed old. The best thing about the place was the televisions on the table. I'm pretty sure they are there because the waitress is going to leave you for at least 15 minutes prior to coming to your table. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and had a good experience, but last week I came again for dinner and had a horrible experience. We waited 10-15 minutes to even be greeted by our server. I watched her go to 2 tables next to us multiple times before even coming to us once with menus. Once we got menu's we quickly ordered chips, salsa and queso due to us being starving. 20 minutes went by and still no appetizer. Next time I saw her walk by we cancelled our food paid for our beers and left. Not once did the waitress apologize, or try to change our mind by checking on the ticket time. Being a server myself, that'd be the first thing I'd do.  I'm not sure I'd be wiling to try this location again, or would recommend it which is a bummer considering the food is good."}
{"text":"Tried this place and was pleasantly delighted! Outstanding service and great food!! Lots of TVs and sports everywhere!! Loved it! Would recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"This sports bar has really made a turn around....in a positive way! I went here to watch the Dallas Cowboys vs. Cardinals game & had such a wonderful time. The servers were great, we found comfy seats right in front of 2 tvs that were playing the game & although the bar was packed, we were never overlooked.  For 3 orders of wings, 8 michelob ultras & 2 24oz of bud light the total was $70.00 which is pretty reasonable. Their wings are really good too! And we had the pulled pork potato skins which were also great! Its hard to find a good bar with good food & drinks but this place did a great job with both....plus the great service was an added bonus! We'll be back for sure!"}
