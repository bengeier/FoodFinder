{"text":"Best place in Laval for take-out sushi. Made perfectly every time and the choices on the menu are diverse enough to please any sushi lover. They are also good with making sushi with rice or soy paper instead of seaweed. Service is fast even on busy nights!"}

{"text":"Nice discovery. The sushis are amazing! We got a Table DHote for lunch. For 2 people, 40$ , small soup, 12 sushis to share, as mains 14 sushis each and 1 fried ice cream (one of the best ones Ive had). Very good price. We even ordered extra sushis even if that was overkill, we were so full at the end. The lobster sushis are amazing. Everyones plate around us looked amazing as well. Would like to try the plates too."}
{"text":"Very good sushi restaurant. It's a little hidden away so if driving you have to look for it but, it's worth looking for. The menu is interesting if you want to get a little fancier and the mixed boxes are always fresh as well as nicely picked/priced. The only thing i would say is they are sometimes inconsistent on delivery times ranging from 15 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Although once delivered, your in for a treat"}
{"text":"Good basic sushi options. Definitely worth the wait and drive if downtown isn't of your preference."}
