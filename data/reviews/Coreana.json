{"text":"I have enjoyed Korean food all over the world (except for Korea!) and usually always love it. I was counting on Coreana to satisfy my Korean craving, but was disappointed. In my experience, one of the best attributes of a Korean restaurant dining experience is the generous array of pickled, spicy, and crunchy condiments that appear soon after you sit down. Unfortunately, Coreana is not so generous; they only bring out a few of these with your meal. Secondly, I was very disappointed that they do not offer chap chae as a main course. I had a dull bibimbap, which required a lot of spicy sauce to improve -- and the tablespoon of beef pieces that accompanied it was paltry indeed! I wish I had seen Oski T's review before I visited Coreana, because others diners' bulgogi and soup/steamed dishes looked far better."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and have eaten at pretty much all the Korean restaurants in Korean town. This new place is most definitely worth a visit. The pan chan was more flavorful than most places and their whole cabbage kimchi is killer! The barley tea super fresh - no sitting in a pot for two days flavor. I had the pork bone soup which was really well flavored and delicious. (Not every place does this staple soup this well.) My fianc√© lived in Seoul for two years and gives this place the two thumbs up! A really stellar addition to K-town."}
{"text":"Finally visited Coreana last Friday with the GF after having passed by the restaurant many times.  The restaurant is located in a unique downstairs space in the little concrete island of restaurants and businesses near the intersection of University and Randall Aves. It's easy to miss driving by if you aren't paying attention, so park around Union South and walk up.

A sign at the entrance promises Korean and Japanese food, but the menu is almost entirely Korean (a Japanese American friend of mine laments at the fact that many \"Japanese\" restaurants are in fact owned  by Koreans--not over the ownership, mind you, but at the quality of the food.  We joke that it's payback over the whole history of colonialism in Korea--i.e., we'll take their food and cook it bad : )

Asian American Studies aside, I ordered the Rock Bowl Bim Bim Bap and the GF got the Kim Chi Ji-Gae.  The Bim Bim Bap came out sizzling, the food and service was quick, ingredients fresh, and the meal overall was satisfying.  The GF's kim-chi had its usual kick, but my Bim Bim Bap took a lot of chili sauce to bring it up to the requisite level of Korean spiciness.

I have to admit that having lived in Los Angeles and haunting the restaurants in Koreatown, we were a bit disappointed with the overall quality compared to LA and the west coast.  With only a couple Korean restaurants in Madison, it's kind of hard to complain though. 

We did notice a lot of Korean diners in the restaurant, many of whom had ordered the bulgogi and other meat dishes which looked quite appetizing, so I would recommend anyone planning to visit Coreana to check these dishes out first, or perhaps some of the soups.  If we end up at Coreana again, we'll definitely choose one of these above..."}
{"text":"I came here after a long day of St. Paddy's day drinking, so this review has that obvious drunken bias where you think whatever you are eating tastes much better than it actually is. But fortunately, I am a pretty big food snob, so I can feel comfortable reviewing Coreana despite my altered state of mind!

The atmosphere is like pretty much every other cheap Korean restaurant in Koreatown - small, white walls and just plain boring. But that's not why we go to these places. Here are all the pros: cheap (most items on the menu are less than $10, I'd say per person, appetizer + main + tip, the meal will come out to around $14-17), a generous variety of free banchan (side dishes), cute and friendly waiters (think Korean hipster boy-band guys!), and of course, yummy food!

My friends and I ordered a pretty good range of items - we got dumplings and a seafood pancake to start, both came promptly and were piping hot! And neither were greasy at all which was great. I ordered the chicken bibimbap. It certainly is not the best bibimbap I have had in Toronto, but satisfying nonetheless. It had a nice home-cooked taste, my only complaint is there could have been more meat in it. My friends ordered a variety of bibimbap, gamjatang (pork bone soup),  and kimchi soft tofu stew (I can't remember the exact name). No one had any complaints and we all left happy and full!"}
{"text":"The ribs.  Enough said.  One of the best meals I've had in Madison and the prices are very reasonable.  The space is very clean and comfortable.   Aesthetically more pleasing than you'd expect judging from the exterior of the building. 

Service was decent and everything was cooked fresh to order.  We will definitely be back.  My only hope is that they do a good lunch business because we were one of two tables on a Saturday night.  Very surprising for what a great place it is."}
{"text":"Ok. The food is still awesome!
My only grouch is that they close the restaurant a lot of times without notice (probably coz they've been having a slow evening).
Once I called the restaurant at 4.30 and the manager said they'd start serving dinner by 5. We got there by 7, and the place was closed!!! I tried calling the same number I had called earlier, but no response...so they were obviously gone! 

Bottom-line....I would call to make sure they're open right before I leave home..."}
{"text":"Nice enough place, doesn't seem overly expensive and has a decent sized menu. They have all the typical Korean dishes, and served me boricha (barley tea) right from the start instead of me having to ask for it. They're generous with the banchan (side dishes) too.

I'd go back."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent Korean.
Caution: Staff generally has poor command of English. You might have to talk to other diners to get your order correct."}
