{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star I would! Tonight I attended a birthday party celebration that SHOULD have ended with a great dinner. Unfortunately not only did we have a completely disgusting experience, the night wad ruined because our string or waiters to management insisted on arguing with the group about incorrect food orders, cold food, and overall disgusting attitudes from simple requests. Ive never had a manager speak to a group of grown women as disrespectful ever in my life. A quick example of the service we received: Two out of the group of 10 women who ordered food selected a flash fried sushi roll and a deep fried sushi roll. Both initially came to the table freezing cold. We politely asked out second water for the night, after we were traded out with another because our initial waiter had a massive attitude bringing out JUST waters to the table, to bring out warmer sushi rolls. Mind you these two are put in a fryer, one longer than the other, and should not be freezing cold. They came out with the retuned sushi rolls and insisted the deep fried roll shouldn't be warm. The flash fried roll was warmer than the deep friend roll. The manager literally argued with one of the grown women in our group stating it shouldn't be listed on their menu as deep fried but flash fried and isn't a hot roll. He even had the nerve to go get a menu to prove a point not realizing on the menu it specifically states the deep fried in bold letters lol. Once he was proven wrong he crumbled the menu up in our faces and stated\" Im not going to argue with you all night', and proceeded to walk away from our table. Literally those exact words in front of a group of women who just came out to enjoy a friends birthday. The young lady who ordered the deep fried roll was so upset she couldn't eat and left the restaurant to sit in the lobby after coming in from out of town to celebrate with a friend and feeling completely disrespected by this member of management. THAT is just ONE of the disgusting encounters we had with this restaurant over the course of an hour and a half. Please be mindful the atmosphere is nice, the dj was excellent, so you will be fooled initially. However, the SERVICE and FOOD are well overrated for the price you have to pay. Management sets the tone in any business. As a member of leadership your job is to resolve the consumers issues with the mind that they keep your business running and you stepping into a position to provide a service. Those men and women from waiters to management were rude and completely untrained or aware of true leadership and customer service. Truly a disgusting experience and I will tell everyone I know."}

{"text":"Leaving this restaurant so incredibly satisfied! I don't EVER leave reviews, but I just had to for this one. They have some of the best sushi I've ever eaten; I got the Spider Roll & the Ballantyne Roll -SO GOOD. On top of that, the service was great, everyone was so kind and helpful! My friend and I were there during the Super Bowl and we still had quick & easy service. We actually were seated next to the owner who is one of the sweetest women I've met! We talked with her practically all night and she made sure we enjoyed ourselves and were taken care of! Really sweet people, amazing food, highly recommend!!"}
