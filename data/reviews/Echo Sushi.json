{"text":"Out of all the sushi restaurants in this area (there are a lot) this is my hands down fave.   Great service compliments great quality sushi at this place."}
{"text":"Definitely \"as good as it gets\"!  As a regular patron for some time, and an 'ex-pat' from Vancouver, I must say this truly is a consistently exceptional AYCE place - great quality, excellent selection, excellent (prompt, friendly, attentive) service, and an all-around great experience.. every time.  A must try for anyone that enjoys sushi.. and has a half-decent appetite."}
{"text":"This has been our go-to sushi place for the last year now.   We're greeted very nicely by employees as soon as we walk in. The service is very quick and prompt, which I really love. The food itself is amazing and so fresh. The shrimp tempura is my favorite. I was never big on sushi until I came to Echo, and now I've tried sushi all over and not much compares. Good eel!"}
{"text":"We went to Echo Sushi for the all-you-can-eat sushi (this place is always full every time I pass by). The sushi was very good, and very fresh. I love the variety of different rolls you get to choose from and that they have the option of brown rice too! They have gotten very creative with their rolls!  The food was served very promptly after each order and the servers were very polite and friendly. Overall, tasty food with reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Finally a Korean/Japanese restaurant in Tramonto!! Great service and great food, fast!"}
{"text":"A great lunch spot for AYCE Japanese. Much bigger selection and variety than other AYCE places. Even non-sushi lovers will find items on the menu they'll like. Just don't come too late into the lunch hour as all the tables get taken quickly. Haven't been there for dinner but I hear they also serve sashimi at that time."}
{"text":"Had to have AYCE sushi in toronto and we chose this place - well worth it! At $21/person, we ate a plethora of sashimi, sushi rolls, salad, assorted hot food, and dessert to account for the price.  I would definitely suggest getting sashimi instead of nigiri - the sashimi cuts were worlds better, fresher, and thicker than the cuts on top of the nigiri pieces.  Left very full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"If there's one thing Echo Sushi wins at, it would be consistency. We were here for dinner a couple years ago and was pleasantly surprised to find that nothing has changed since.   We came for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon and were seated right away. Food service was quick and they didn't miss a single order. Even though the menu doesn't have anything fancy, all the staples are there, and the quality of the food is better than your average ayce sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This sushi joint beats all other \"All you can eat sushi\" joints in Toronto hands down. Normally speaking when you put in an order at all you can eat sushi place you have to wait a life time for the waiters to bring you your order and even then they half whatever it is that you order AND the sushi looks either sloppily done and or shames Japanese food.  Boy was I surprised to see my order come after 2 mins top of giving the waitress my order sheet. The sushi is nicely presented and overall the food is well prepared and the taste rivals places such as Non all you can eat places like New Generation. For dessert I loved the mango pudding and loved it even more that it was served beautifully in a baby cup with a baby spoon. :) For $22 on a weekend I say check this place out!"}
{"text":"Although there are not many sushi options out this way - Echo stands head and shoulders above even the high rated Scottsdale sushi joints. The service is spot on, establishment is clean, water is filtered, fish is fresh...as is everything they serve! Black rice takes it over the top. All of the above for a very reasonable price!! This little place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I got all you can eat for $30. There was a large variety of food which was good. However, the food ranged from alright to good - nothing exemplary. Servers were nice. My only complaint is their menu: in the pan-fried section they have a dumpling option. The dumplings provided by these menu option are in no way pan fried unless they decided to not turn on the heat for the stove. That would be okay but they insisted that we pay for the food. I disagree with this sort of customer service and can't give it more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"We went for lunch this Saturday and the sushi was delicious. Well made and all that we asked came to the table. Great AYCE sushi place! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We are sooo happy this place is close! Tried or for the first time tonight and loved it. Will definitely be back!  Great service, amazing Sushi!"}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in Toronto in my opinion. Lots to choose from on the menu and the sushi is very good. The mackerel and eel are to die for, they just melt in your mouth. I make sure I'm starving when I go here!"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST AHI-POKE BOWL IN NORTH PHOENIX!  Large portion, very fresh, great flavor, and extremely satisfying. My wife had the Bibimbop (Korean Beef) and enjoyed it too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place for all u can eat!!! Only place I go to around the hood. So good. The price is so reasonable. Been there a bunch of time.  Best thing is the sashimi and the rolls. The beef ribs is also awesome!!!  Enjoy;)"}
{"text":"Out of all the AYCE sushi places in this city, I personally find this one to be one of the best. The fish always taste fresh and their sashimi is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I ordered the Tower, salmon sashimi, miso soup, and green tea Mochi.  I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants and this place is by far my favorite in Arizona.  I haven't been to many restaurants in the Phoenix area, but it knocks anything in Tucson out of the park.  The salmon sashimi in particular was amazing.  Thick, fresh pieces that honestly was comparable to the much more expensive fish I got in Seattle (our bill there was $200 for two people).    They aren't kidding around with the tower. I was expecting larger pieces of sushi, but what I got was one large piece, about the size of a cake for two.  It was tasty, the cake shape made it way easier to eat than traditional sushi.  The black rice was unique and added depth and flavor, I also feel like it does a better job of being sticky, but not soggy, than white rice does.   A small thing I appreciated was that the mochi ice cream wasn't too frozen to eat.  Way too many places I've been to have served me it while it was too frozen, and I end up having to wait a couple minutes for it to thaw enough for me to even stick my fork in it.    It's a bit of a drive from Phoenix but well worth it if you've got the time!"}
{"text":"My wife would give it a solid 5 star, cause she doesnt eat much red meat but for me it is one of the best part of the japanese kitchen. The service there is better than an avarage sushi place. Selection of food is just good enough. Only one thing is missing for me that is the red meat that they use is not that great but other than that thay are simply one of the best sushi place in toronto."}
{"text":"They're newly opened so we need to cut them some slack for a few months. I ordered a carefree roll take out with no avocado because I'm allergic to it and cucumber. when I arrived they said they were remaking it because the first one had avocado in it. The presentation was nice and the role was well-made, but had cucumbers in it which was not listed in the ingredients. I had to tear the roll apart to pick out the slivers of cucumber which was annoying. The ingredients were very fresh and the role was otherwise well-made. Prices are on the high-end with my roll costing seven $15.75 before A one dollar tip which I wish I hadn't left. I'll certainly try it again because they'll work the kinks out, but the prices will make that not my first choice."}
{"text":"I love this sushi place. The quality of the sushi is great for an all you can eat sushi restaurant. Their pretty quick with their service and everything tastes fresh. I've been twice and both times were a delightful experience."}
{"text":"My longtime trusty AYCE sushi restaurant. Being going here for years. Service and food is great. Servers are very friendly, I enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"We've been going to Echo sushi for almost 8 years now, it's our favourite place. We used to get a lot of \"all you can eat\" deals, which are always great, and a good value for your money. Now we're less greedy and still enjoy their food. Even our kids like it. Try the grilled eggplant, if you're not into raw fish; or cubed steak w/garlic; or katsu don. And the brown rice sushi is really yummy too. In short, a great place and I hope they stay there for a long, long time."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, the bf and I decided to give it a try for dinner on a Friday night.  When we arrived it wasn't busy and had our choice of seats.  Very clean, nice, simple decor, typical of most AYCE sushi places.   Service was very good...they are very attentive without constantly being in your face.  The table was always cleared shortly after we finished the last plate of food and a new menu appeared for any re-ordering.   It was a relaxed, peaceful atmosphere - didnt feel rushed to order and the noise level was great.  The bf and I could have a conversation without yelling across the table from one another :p Foodwise, we were happy overall.  For an AYCE place, the quality of the fish was fairly fresh and appetizing.  Good portion size and served pretty quick after ordering. With all the other sushi places around the area, Echo is my favorite so far!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday (Thursday night) for AYCE.   Price-wise, it's quite expensive for a weekday. The servers were decent, cleared our plates quickly and served water/tea efficiently.  The salmon sashimi was not the freshest, it was just ok. I liked the brown-rice option for 5-6 of their maki rolls, however, if you prefer brown rice for their other rolls, it will cost you extra.  Also worth mentioning, they don't offer all of their maki rolls from their regular menu on their AYCE menu.  Teriyaki beef and salmon were both quite bland. Oh, don't order the eggplant teriyaki, it was just a lump of tasteless mess.  This was my first time going to Echo Sushi, and it will be my last. There are better AYCE sushi restaurants out there."}
{"text":"The best All You Can Eat Sushi in Toronto? It definitely lives up to its title.  I went here today for my 18th birthday and absolutely loved every bite. The menu is vast with many options, ranging from regular sushi to more extravagant teriyaki and even sushi pizza (although we didn't try this).  The fish was fresh and flavourful, each piece seemed to be cut and crafted with care. The chefs also add a large amount of fish, unlike most AYCE restaurants, which use too much rice to save on the cost of fish.  Service was good, but they seemed a bit understaffed. There were only two waitresses serving and bussing tables for about 25 people during the evening rush.  Make sure to place a reservation if you have a party of four or more! The restaurant is quite compact and the majority of the tables were filled with couples out for dinner. One group of 6 had to wait almost half an hour to get a seat.  All in all, the experience was wonderful and I plan to return, despite the long drive from my home in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Racist place. If you are dark skin don't go there or get ready to be treated like 3rd class citizens.  So after reading all the reviews I walked into the restaurant all excited about the food. Just as I got in I was seated at a table, table was really sticky my hands were sticking to it. Just as I was about to ask them to clean the table, I saw a booth opened up and I was with my wifey and we were out on a date night so I requested the booth. The server rudely replied to me that the booth is not available. I am politely asked as to why that booth was not available? No reason was provided and just said it was not available. Just as I was about to hand in my menu for the order, I saw a couple walk in ( white couple) I clearly saw without any request for the booth they were given the booth.  That was clear text book racism. The service and the attitude of the servers is disgusting. I walked out ."}
{"text":"Good place. Fast service, clean place (bathrooms included), fresh food. It's $20.99 for dinner on a weeknight. They had a wide variety of sushi, hand rolls and sashimi. Their green tea ice cream was great (highly recommended). But their shrimp tempura was not as a crispy as I liked and it wasn't golden yellow. They did not have fried rice (like other places usually do) and did not have buttered mushroom (my favourite). Their teriyaki salmon was really good (big piece) and their shrimp skewers were also really tasty.   Giving them 3/5 because I think it's pricy for a weeknight, it's missing some of my favourite items, and the restaurant doesnt look that nice."}
{"text":"Awesome.  I am only bummed out that I will only be able to eat here every 3 years or so, as I live in Michigan.  Floored that I was able to order rock solid, amazing sushi on my way out of Phoenix this last July.  Locals, count your lucky stars - this is great sushi!"}
{"text":"Worst Japanese food I've had in Toronto. Ordered the chirashi as I do when I try out a new sushi restaurant. You can tell how fresh their fish is as well as the taste, texture, and consistency of their sushi rice when ordering this dish. Fail on all accounts. Run by non-Japanese."}
{"text":"I like this place about how they have their speciality. I visited with my sister for all-you-can-eat sushi.  Generally, their sushi, sashimi, and rolls are fantastic, but their kitchen food is not my best. It was my first time trying the multi-grain rice rolls (brown rolls). I love them. They are delicious. I think I have ordered them like 50 pieces at least. I would definitely go again for the brown rolls.  The restaurants itself was wonderful. The servers were skillful and kind."}
{"text":"The sashimi was delicious especially the salmon. Everything else was meh. The rolls weren't nicely done with rice falling off. The spicy salmon had more tempura bits than salmon. It did not satisfy my craving for sushi. The cook food was acceptable but nothing exceptional. There is a wide variety of rolls and sushi you can choose from but it is not any more than any other place. For the price, I think you can do better.   I would not eat here again"}
{"text":"Sushi is worth every cent! Lots of high quality fish used. Friendly staff. Just great!!!"}
{"text":"Very good experience. Stopped in for solo lunch. Ordered cucumber salad, spring rolls and sashimi appetizer choices. All were excellent and plentiful. Miso soup came out first followed by salad and then rolls. Sashimi came out last but was fabulous. I couldn't eat all and took salad and rolls home. Waitress was very polite and professional. Water was a little metallic tasting but it was city water after all. Prices were in line with higher end Japanese restaurants - not a cheap meal but great experience. Do again soon."}
{"text":"Decent for all you can eat sushi. However, the restaurant gets busy at times and I have had to wait for a table a few times, especially on weekend evenings.   The service is fast and friendly enough.  Selection is also quite large with the more expensive \"B\" menu.  Everything is quite fresh and brown rice sushi is offered as part of the AYCE menu."}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend with a large group for the AYCE dinner. The service was great and food was delicious. Will definitely come back here for my next bout of AYCE! (Also the fact that they have brown rice sushi is an added bonus)"}
{"text":"The first time I was there, I loved it. The second time , so so. The third time, I decided I will not come back. The quality of food decreased each time and seems to have more and more rice each time. In the end it was a roll of rice with a pinch of salmon. :(  I actually liked the restaurant in the beginning."}
{"text":"I went with my review collaborator for an AYCE dinner.  It wasn't anything special but it wasn't the worst place I've been to.  The unagi, chicken skewers,  avocado and salmon were outstanding, but the other dishes (red snapper, red tuna, octopus, scallops, surf clam, avocado and mango sushi rolls and salmon skin hand rolls) were merely decent, especially given the high price (~$31 after tax).  Service was excellent. The staff were friendly and attentive (refilled our tea, didn't take dishes away early, didn't smell like the food they were serving) and took our dietary restrictions into account graciously.   The tables were well sized and spaced out properly. The ambiance and decor were very pleasant.  Overall we wouldn't go back because despite the service and appearance, we can get comparable sushi for less elsewhere, but price is the only negative factor so if you are willing to spend more than usual, this is the place for AYCE sushi for you."}
{"text":"Nice little place and clean quiet ambiance. We had Tempura Udon and the Carefree Special with a Sapporo beer. Service was friendly and fast. Food was very fresh and the Las Vegas Rolls on the Carefree Special were awesome. Tempura was yummy and light. The Udon soup was well cooked but needed a little soy sauce to kick up the flavor. All in all a good meal and a great addition to the neighborhood. We will be back."}
{"text":"A disappointment.  Even in terms of AYCE (all you can eat) sushi.   What's different on the menu is the brown rice sushi roll selection. They were the worst thing we ordered. The brown rice on the outside of the rolls look red ,  red like red bean and tastes sweet to boot. Yuck!  The Udon soup with spicy beef, the beef was sweet not spicy?  The panfried dumplings were steamed?  What the heck?   Just an average all you can eat sushi place with the standard rolls and cooked food selection. Don't  expect good food, and if it's good it's a surprise. You can't trust everything on the menu will be done properly.  I had high expectations here. Why?  Because yelpers scored this place a 4 star at the time of this writing, plus I saw a sign on the store window being voted best sushi place from dine.to  We had to try it. It sucked and now we know.  2 stars I had much better."}
{"text":"GREAT place for All-You-Can-Eat Sushi!  A bit on the pricier side when it comes to this type of cuisine in this area, but well worth it if you're a fan of high-quality Sashimi and raw fish. Service is excellent and very prompt, and the focus here is on amazingly fresh and delicious dishes, not a 25-page all-you-can-eat menu with mediocre food.  I'll definitely be back and hopefully won't have to wait too long to get a seat this time :)"}
{"text":"Great buffet, slightly pricey for sushi, but worth it. Waitresses in traditional Japanese clothes and the fact that decorations on the wall are from Japan accentuates the originality of this place."}
{"text":"Used to be my fav AYCE place but its consistently lower and lower in sushi quality.   The salmon the last 3x is so fatty. And they've altered some previous rolls to make it easier/faster to make so there not as tasty.   Still a decent place but not what it used to be."}
{"text":"I spent $100 on a meal my family did not at all enjoy. We ordered sushi and were not not told that they only use black rice. All the food came out with \"black rice\" which appeared purple in color and was off putting in taste. Sushi was flavorless and over priced. We would not go back."}
{"text":"Good sushi but not amazing. The place is nice and clean and service is fast. I had sushi combo A which was more than enough for one person and it comes with tea and salad.   The place is small and was semi full when I went which was weekday. Also they close at 3pm which is less than ideal but they open at 5pm. Overall great and I recommend."}
{"text":"My friend and I were driving through the area and decided to go in. The place is small, and it was very busy, but we still got a table right away. We were handed a menu and three sheets on which to tick off our choices. We decided to go for choice B, ($20.99) as it has more options than A ($17.99). We went on a Friday night, and prices are higher by a couple of dollars on fri-sun than on weekdays.  We chose about 6 or 7 of their special rolls, some sashimi, sushi pizza, veggie and shrimp tempura, and some nigiri. We were a little scared that this would be way too much food for two girls, but we were really hungry. The fist part of what we ordered came out very fast and we were impressed. The sashimi was all very fresh, and the nigiri delicious.  We finished all we had in fromt of us, but we were still missing all our  rolls and a few other things from our order. So we waited. And then we waited some more. And more. 30 minutes went by and no one brought out the rest of our food, cleared our plates, or checked in on us. At this point my friend called over the waitress, who came by, dropped off a new order sheet on our table and walked away. Fine, we'd re- order what we wanted and had clearly gotten lost on its way.  A few minutes later the first half of our second order shows up. The shushi pizza was good, but it had pickled onions on top, which I've never had on sushi pizza before, however I didn't mind it. The spicy salmon roll was good, but no spicy enough for me. The crunchy roll was yummy, as were the green and red salmon rolls, all good. Not great, but good. However we were still missing the second half of the items that we had re-ordered.  I called the waitress over and she told me sorry, but we lost the sheet, so can you please re-order what you are missing? Again? Really? At this point both my friend and I were pretty annoyed, so we told her all we wanted was the \"firehouse\" roll and our bill, thank you very much. Well, the firehouse roll was good and weird at the same time. It had banana in it, spicy tuna and tempura flakes on top. The combination was yummy, but I'm still surprised to find banana in my sushi.  This AYCE is good, and the selection you get is great for the money, and everything is really fresh, however the service was so attrocious that for the first time in a very long time I found myself wanting to tip less than generously. I'm going to give this place one more shot, since maybe they were just having an off day, but that's all they get, and I hope that the next time around my food doesn't get lost on its way to my table.   Also worh noting, they don't have debit available, so have cash or credit available when you come here."}
{"text":"Liked the big selection for their lunch menu.  The place was clean, smelled clean and the food was great.  To sum it up I was happy and I will go back, hows that?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The portion sizes are great and the all you can eat price is really reasonable. They have deep fried bananas for dessert and they are the best thing I have ever tasted. I love their cucumber rolls, I live far and travel just to come to Echo sushi because I love the quality of food and the price. Staff are really friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"The sashimi was very good, fish was super fresh and AYCE was very reasonably priced. Service was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Great local sushi spot , seems they only have about two servers on at all times, which can slow things a bit, but nonetheless my wife and I received attention from both servers multiple times to ensure our cups were filled and our needs were met! So for the service I want to say great job!  Now when the food came out, I ordered the echo special , and each piece came prepared beautifully and made with black rice (a new superfood) which I personally love . My wife had the Chicken Teriyaki and loved the dish as well ! You will definitely see us again soon Echo Sushi !!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this establishment.  It is a very small location...only 5 seats at the sushi bar.  The wait staff took awhile to acknowledge me upon sitting at the sushi bar.  I first asked about the complimentary soup, which apparently is only when ordering a \"meal\".  Why is ordering sushi rolls not considered a meal?  I usually go for the sushi rolls, and their options were decent.  They have the typical rolls plus some others to chose from.  The rice, however, is black...a \"super-food\"...whatever that is (higher in vitamins).  I ordered the rainbow roll and the carefree roll.  The overall flavor of the rolls was good, but I did not care for the black rice...it was too soft, and my rolls kept falling apart because it wasn't sticky enough, compared to white rice.  Plus, I just didn't like the flavor of the rice.  Also to be noted...they use crab mix, instead of real crab sticks/cucumber in their California rolls (which I absolutely detest!)  It is a cheap alternative to good sushi.  If you are going to pay $13 for a rainbow roll...it should be a real California roll on the bottom, not some cheap crab mix version!  I also thought the seaweed salad was a bit over priced for what you got...it was good, but not worth the price.  Hopefully, they will have white rice in the future.  Overall, it was an over-priced meal that was just ok...probably won't return."}
{"text":"Geat food, especially braun rice sushi!"}
{"text":"If you don't care about the dollars it will cost you to eat at this place then go there for satisfactory food.  But don't drink their new MU bottle of Sacki that Daniel (the owner and chef) pushes on you.  I took his advice and drank the bottle (about 10ozs) but when the bill was given to me a charge of $29.00 just for this Sacki bottle was on my check.  (OUTRAGES)   Also don't ever eat their raw oysters on the half shell if you don't mind sitting on your throne at home for days on end.  What a horrible experience that was.   The store front environment also leaves a lot to be desired in dining there."}
{"text":"Cheap and affordable food! Lunch AYCE variety is pretty good, I wont say the best but good for what its worth."}
{"text":"I have been hearing good things from my customers getting donuts!  I tried the spicy pork bento box; it had a little bit of everything.  It was delish!  The sushi roll was good, I usually prefer raw fish but the tempura shrimp roll had good flavor... I would expect even better flavor with fresh fish.  Being in the food industry I can tell customer service was spot on.  I can't wait to go back and sit at the sushi bar with my wife."}
{"text":"So nice to finally have a great sushi restaurant close by! My husband picked it up and brought it home. Ramen soup was amazing and delicious. Fish was fresh and the rolls made with the forbidden rice was a neat change of pace. We have leftovers for lunch tomorrow! We will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in North Phoenix.  Small, the servers are polite etc but ultimately the food is awesome!  We love all of the rolls that we have had here.  Convenient, reasonably priced and great food.  What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"PROS 1. Fresh fish 2. Purple/black rice 3. Daniel (sushi chef) is really good at what he does 4. Non-strip mall vibe  CONS 1. The newer sushi chefs are not as good as Daniel. Really makes a difference in the taste/texture of the sushi. 2. Always a bit on the warm side in the restaurant. Turn up the A/C. They have fans that aren't cutting it. 3. Would be nice to have white rice option. I like the purple/black, but understand how others may not."}
{"text":"This has been our go to sushi restaurant for a couple of years now. Very consistent, fresh and great value. It gets busy during peak times so call and make a reservation if you can."}
{"text":"The service was great and the sushi was unique. They use black rice instead of white and it makes for a cool experience. The atmosphere in the place was great as well."}
{"text":"So it's a Saturday night and my brother in law who's down for Easter and I are hungry for some sushi. We head to Echo and being new in the area are still looking for some places to eat at. All I can is amazing. Service is spot on, friendly. The food. Wow. I've never had eel before and I got sent over the edge in a very good way. Please give these good people your business if you want good quality and amazing service. I couldn't be more pleased! Wow."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in over 5 years and still as good as I remembered. Came in on a Saturday,  The service was good, the food came at a reasonable time.  The quality of the food is better than most sushi places I've been.  So I am a fan and will be back :)"}
{"text":"Was just here for my first time this past weekend. Loved it. Small. Very clean. Efficient and friendly service. Would recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I came in again to try the ultimate dragon roll and it was amazing! still just as fresh and good as the first time. i highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Nigiri was good. They garnish with real wasabi and use purple rice which is always a nice thing to see.   The ramen unfortunately was VERY disappointing. The noodles and the egg were both overcooked. I felt like I was eating noodles from a can... that bad. We asked for extra egg and I guess that means you get one whole egg instead of a half an egg. The broth lacked significant flavor as well.  Atmosphere was quaint and the space was cozy. Just the way we like it. We will be back for some more nigiri, but I will skip the ramen next time."}
{"text":"Amazing quality sushi for its price.. and their staff is really nice too. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"This sushi place is actually so bomb! I'm really picky with sushi places, especially the ones that serve sashimi. But the sashimi here is so fresh and the pieces are a decent size. The other meat items are also really good. They aren't smothered in taiyaki sauce. The salmon teriyaki was also not dry l, which is a surprise from an AYCE place. The price is high but it's worth. Service is also good. Most of the food came out after the first time calling it."}
{"text":"This review is from my first visit on their 2nd day soft opening. I have high hopes for these guys and look forward to my next visit. Just some wrinkles for them to iron out:  - Complimentary miso soup was barely warm. It was tasty but almost cold.  - Hot sake was barely warm. Should be hot.  - Not everything on the menu was available. If uni is only there on the weekends I'd encourage that to be on the menu.   + Beautiful prep & presentations + Everything was fresh + Variety of rolls was on par with other places but with their own individual spin on some things  / Not sure if I liked the black rice or not. I think it is something that could go with certain rolls, but I might suggest making it optional vs the standard. It was a new experience for me which was great, but there's something to be said for regular sushi rice  All in all I will return and update or add a new review once they work out the kinks.   I do recommend you give them a shot."}
{"text":"I have to admit, when I first saw pictures of this place it really didn't appeal to me. It's a small AYCE sushi restaurant with an average-looking interior. But what I first noticed when I sat down at the table was how the chopsticks were neatly folded into the napkin. I guess it was an attempt at origami? (lol) But it's the intricate details that impressed me and made this place stand out. On to the food!  It's a pretty standard AYCE sushi place with the menu being very similar to other sushi restaurants. Not much variety compared to Heart Sushi but it's an easy menu to understand. It does the simple stuff right! Everything was fresh from the Miso Soups to Hand Rolls to the Sashimi. The quality of the food was on point! My friends and I finished everything we ordered and did not leave a single Sushi Roll to waste!  My only complaint about this place is they forgot some of our orders but hey, nobody's perfect. If you're looking a great sushi place to eat in Toronto, check out Echo Sushi! It's $15.99 for Lunch and $23.99 for Dinner.   This place is simplicity at it's finest!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, piping hot sake, great service. Finally a good sushi joint in the north valley"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place whenever we drive into the valley. We specifically make sure to drive when we know they're open. My avocado rolls are to die for. The purple rice here is so flavorful and the poke bowls are incredible. Love this place."}
{"text":"Decent local sushi. Quick service, you can order from the acye menu but I decided to try the lunch specials instead. The Bento box specials are pretty good and you have a good mix of items in the bento box. Unfortunately the chef burnt the heck out of my beef short ribs, probably my fault for not sticking with sushi.   So my tip is.... if you go to a sushi restaurant. Eat sushi...  I will definitely come back to this restaurant the sushi rolls are good the sushi does not fall apart when you pick them up with chopsticks."}
{"text":"Been waiting for sushi in this neighborhood. This was DELICIOUS!!  We did several cut rolls and they were all YUM! I like the dark rice instead of typical white rice, but it's also MUCH more filling (we ordered too much)  NOW, I would have given more stars, however they are new and have a LOT of kinks to work out on the service end. Everyone was pleasant, it was just chaotic and one person didn't know what the other was doing. They obviously didn't do a \"soft\" opening!!!  We'll go back, but not until they've been open longer and figure out their service issues."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the airport for our journey home when we realized a quick lunch detour was in order!  We stopped here on a Tuesday around 12pm. Seated immediately.  Their menu is great! Lots of sushi options, bento boxes, ramen and udon. What stood out was their seafood ramen!! You don't always see seafood ramen on a menu! So obviously, I had to try!  Service was a little strange. We asked the server how the pork for the bento box was prepared and he stated he wasn't sure and just stood there. Didn't offer to find out. Then I asked him if why the Baked Salmon roll only had scallops listed in the description, and if it contained salmon and again he just shrugged and said he didn't know. We had to ask him both times to find out for us, as we genuinely were interested in the items but wanted to know how they were served!  Then when I asked for the to-go box for my ramen, he brought the check but no box. By this time we had to leave to catch our flight so we didn't bother wait and ask for the to-go box again. Lousy service. Young kid who hasn't been trained in customer service yet.    As for the food, my bf got a bento box with the bbq pork I believe. The pork was dry. Wouldn't recommend. The rest of the items were good!  I enjoyed my seafood ramen! It was pretty spicy and made my lips burn, so if you're not one for spice, avoid this! I thought the seafood assortment in it was great! Huge mussels, clams and squid! Great! The bowl was probably the biggest ramen bowl I've ever seen! Huge!! And cheap! $11!!  Overall, we enjoyed this sushi restaurant, but were let down by the service.  Good menu and good food. Would return if we were back in the area probably."}
{"text":"Food was awesome service needs a little work.  A/c needed to be turned up but there fresh out of the shoot."}
{"text":"Everything was good about this place. The portions were great, the price of $19.99 that included sashimi was good and they were not slow at ALL in getting the orders out (they also got them out exactly as we had ordered them)  But at the end of the night, I wasn't feeling so good. I hadn't ordered anything out of ordinary and I think the red snapper might have been a smidge too **something** (watery, tasteless, bland..), and the food sat really heavily on my stomach that night.  I wasn't sick, I was decently hungry and I ---love---- sushi  I left full but not happy, if that makes sense. Even though everything looked and was good, there was something about that food last night that didn't make me feel good like AYCE usually does and I don't know why which puzzles me.  So I'm giving this 3 stars for now and if I ever go back, I'll see if I get the same feeling about the food before I leave."}
{"text":"Echo Sushi is my favourite local AYCE. Great service, super fresh sushi, a little pricey for week nights but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It is very tiny but inviting and the service is always great! Great vibe and great sushi!"}
{"text":"Finally, a sushi place in our neighborhood! Seriously, this is the BEST sushi I've had in a long time.. and I eat sushi probably twice a week. They just opened one day ago and they've already got great service, quick turnaround times, and phenomenal sushi. Their fish is so fresh and they use black rice which is a super food! I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. Caitlyn was our server and was so friendly. Super super impressed."}
{"text":"The service, food and the ambience are excellent. My favorite is the spicy salmon sushi."}
{"text":"I went for ayce lunch for $15.99. Food came out promptly. Everything was below average. The rice tasted completely unseasoned and plain. Fish was not particularly fresh. Tempura was soggy. Beef and chicken skewers had textures of dried meat. Seaweed salad was too salty. Epitome of fast food sushi."}
{"text":"The majority of the speciality rolls here are quite tasty. They also put large slices of fish if you order sushi at lunchtime.  However, most kitchen items (mainly all their beef dishes) are very oily and most of the ribs were burnt. With the exception of the chicken skewers, they were good. I would have rated this place higher because some of their rolls are delicious (snow diamond is one worth mentioning).  Seems like they are closed for a couple hours in the afternoon and my partner and I had arrived at 2:20pm for their lunch. We were handed the sheet for last call before 3 and had been receiving multiple frowns from one of their sushi chefs standing behind the counter for most of the time we were eating. I believe they should make changes to the location of where the chefs constructs the sushi, the counter is right in the middle of the dining area.  Its not exactly pleasant seeing a grumpy chef in the corner of your eye while you're eating!"}
{"text":"Yum! Went yesterday for dinner, did the AYCE and it was great! We went with menu A because my partner and I are vegetarian so the more expensive menu is pointless.   The food is sooo good. The inari roll, avocado salad, veggie tempura.. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the seaweed & avocado salad but I think that's more personal taste preference than anything.  The service is good, if not a bit pushy. They're so quick about clearing away empty dishes, and really fast about bringing new food. The only weird thing was when we finished we had to wait 5-10 minutes before any one came by so we could ask for our bill, not sure what that was about?  Other than that, awesome, beer is cheap, I'd definitely go back and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times over the years.  In short, I don't think this is a bad place nor do I think it's great.  They have a wide selection and the food comes out quick but only the Salmon Tataki comes to mind as something being sort of memorable.       I give this place 3 stars because it is average quality but it is worth the price.  But in all fairness, I've never been to an AYCE sushi spot in the city that deserves more than 3 stars.  If you want to do all you can eat sushi uptown (south of Sheppard), then this place should be on your short list."}
{"text":"Man oh man this place is a gem. My mind has been blown. I come from Vancouver, the city that pretty much invented the All You Can Eat Sushi, and over there we are grown up spoiled with excellent Japanese food at bargain prices. However, for the past 12 years I have been to countless of these AYCE sushi factories, and I had given up hope that any would be worth the money, whether in Vancouver or else where. So you can imagine my surprise when I came to this place and experienced the best AYCE experience of my life... And in Totonto of all places! The food here is just delicious, and the price worth every penny. The only downside is that the sashimi and the overall quality of fish is only as good and fresh as it gets in Ontario, which is not great by Westcoast standards. Other than that, everything is fantastic, especially the brown rice rolls, and many of the grill and pan fried items from the kitchen.... Dam, that egg plant teriyaki alone was worth the admission price. Most importantly, although you are getting the AYCE option, the portions are still dignified and nicely presented. This is in sharp contrast to almost all places when you opt for the AYCE they insult you as if you are a lower class citizen by bringing sashimi orders that are cut sliver thin or limited to max orders, or by 2 inch thick rolls of rice in the makis, or by putting a peanut sized fish on top of a mountain of rice and calling it nigri, all in their illusion that this somehow maximizes their profits, and the idiotic AYCE customers will still come back to eat that garbage. Nope, this place obviously operates by the right philosophy that if you provide good food at good value, people will come. I will be for sure, keeping fingers crossed that with increased popularity, this place won't start cutting corners and drift down in their quality.  You like Japanese food, and you eat a lot? Run, don't walk to this place and indulge in the deliciousness my friend."}
{"text":"This place has good quality food and a lot of variety of Japanese food. Decor is simple. Try the fried bananas for dessert. There was sometimes a lineup out the door early Saturday night."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  It's close to home and has wonderful service!!!  The spicy tuna roll and the rainbow roll are one of our favorites but to be honest I don't believe we have ordered anything we didn't like... Definitely will be one of our regular places to visit for sushi"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi for sure, specially the sashimi and its beef ribs. The sashimi is thick and fresh! Have been here for a couple years and I highly recommend it. *it also open on Easter Sunday.*"}
{"text":"Let me just echo one word: deeeeliiciouusss.   The sushi was fresh and the kitchen food was so yummy.  The interior of this place was really nice and the service was really fast.  As for the price, its affordable. I paid for an ayce ; $14.99 + tax which was worth it. Overall, my first experience was awesome and I'll definitely come back .  Tip: Come early because when I came around 12, it was so packed already."}
{"text":"To start off, I'm from LA and have had some amazing sushi back home. I've tried a few sushi places in Phoenix and this the first place I've really liked, so that's a great start.   My boyfriend and I went there for lunch this weekend and sat at the sushi bar, with Daniel as the sushi chef. I didn't catch the waiter's name but he was generally nice and pleasant. The only place he missed the mark was by not noticing both of our waters being empty when we were one of three parties in the restaurant (total of 5 customers). Other than that, no complaints.  Now, on to the sushi... we had three rolls between the two of us and enjoyed all of them. I wasn't a huge fan of the New York Crunch Roll, but that's just about a personal preference and I can still say it was great sushi. Overall the fish was fresh and was very tasty. The rice is very cool looking but I do have to say it doesn't hold up quite as well as sticky white rice. I'm more than willing to look past that, though.   The prices are a little high for a casual sushi restaurant but with enough feedback that may change in time. I'm still willing to pay a little more for the quality but I hope management sees that their prices are just a little high for what you get. I wasn't aware that this restaurant is new until after we went (new to this area) so maybe this is one of the kinks they need to work out as a new eatery.   Overall, we really enjoyed our lunch and will certainly be back! Also, I really loved their decor was simple yet very tasteful."}
{"text":"Been to this place two times now. First time we went we were not impressed BUT we decided to give it another try since it has such high ratings, we thought the first time we'd gone was a one off but were we ever wrong.   Service: 4 stars Staff very nice and attentive, zero complaints in that department.   Food: Sashimi 3.5 Sushi 3 Maki 2.5 Hot food 3  The sashimi was fresh, clean no nasty fishy smell and prices were a decent size. Sashimi was the best thing at echo sushi. The sushi I've given it a 3 simply because there was too much rice and the rice was bad. The rice was of the wrong consistancy, it was warm, tasted bad and made my bf and I feel not so good. Maki I gave 2.5 because of the rice. The hot foods were okay, honestly not the worst but not the best either. I did get some very burnt dumplings and tiny beef ribs (refer to photos).   Overall, echo sushi is not the worst AYCE I've been to but it's also not worth it's high rating it has. I would recommend Sushi One in the Yonge and Sheppard area if you don't mind the distance."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi joint in Toronto.   The fish is so fresh.  Service is amazing (they're so fast), and I think it's $20 a person (or close to that). You can't beat that.   Yes we've all heard that the quality of sushi you get at an AYCE sushi place is crappy, but that is NOT the case at Echo Sushi.   It's DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and sashimi. Fantastic, friendly, fast services. Small  cozy venue. Varied selection possibilities. Excellent quality, quantity and very reasonable. Why would you go anywhere else?  A must try. I will certainly return."}
{"text":"My favourite all you can eat sushi in the city. Generous portions (especially considering when my man orders 15 pieces of sashimi they bring him all 15), friendly and attentive wait staff, large menu but not too big that they don't pay attention to quality, and decently priced at around $20.99 on a weeknight. I've been here twice in the past two months and will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible, the food is not fresh. They offer lots of side dish and failed in main dish. I ordered spicy chicken and I can barely find actual chicken in it."}
{"text":"Looking for a bad review? look somewhere else. This place is amazing. The AYCE menu (lunch and dinner) are both great for a reasonable price: wide variety, fresh and food comes quick. I am a big fan of their seaweed salad, dynamite roll, steak teriyaki and cube steak garlic. The servers are fast, speak good english and are aware if you have an empty plate or an empty glass that needs to be filled."}
{"text":"Decent all you can eat sushi place. Good sushi all around including lots of rolls and sushi pizza."}
{"text":"The best quality AYCE sushi I have had in Toronto. Very reasonably priced without skimping on ingredient quality, taste, selection and service. I WILL NEVER EAT SUSHI ANYWHERE ELSE AGAIN - it's that good !!!!!! :D"}
{"text":"Echo Sushi is currently my top choice for All You Can Eat Sushi! The quality here is really very good, particularly considering that it's AYCE!  The place is always busy which you want from an AYCE place because it means that their ingredients are fresh due to high throughput. The service is pretty decent and the food comes fairly quickly. They have a couple of their own unique sushi rolls which are great, such as the riceless sushi roll and their deep fried football roll. I also consider their beef ribs to be the best I've ever had at an AYCE place relatively speaking.  Due to their popularity, their prices have been increased in the 2015/2016 time frame but if you really want AYCE Sushi and you want quality, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"A very solid 4/5 stars for me.  I went with a group of friends; I was pleasantly surprised to see the offering of brown rice, which turned out to be super moist and tasty. I ordered a couple Philadelphia Rolls for this reason. Others at my table ordered udon and meat dishes, and said they were tasty and cooked well. Our tempura was done well with a thin batter.  Our service was very efficient with rolls arriving quickly. The salmon sashimi tasted delicious and the portions were quite large. We went for dinner on a Thursday and paid $24.99, which is slightly more expensive but in my opinion well worth it. The location was spacious and they had multiple tables for groups of four."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We went on a Friday night and it was very busy so we ended up waiting about 40 minutes for our to go order. And they forgot to give us our miso soup. The rolls are pretty expensive compared to other places but they also seem a bit larger so you can order less and still have plenty to eat. We ended up with more than we could finish. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After trying a few different sushi spots near the Yonge & Eg area, I can say that this is my favourite. The sushi is very fresh and the staff are friendly. My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday evening and the place was very busy. Luckily we got a seat right away but others had to wait for a table. The menu had everything you could expect from a sushi restaurant and food came quickly.   If you're looking for a new sushi joint I would recommend giving this spot a try!"}
{"text":"First time at Echo, our tastes were very discerning. We love the fact they use black rice, which is a superfood. The rainbow roll was served with black rice (superfood) and a crab meat center, very good. The Hamachi Kama was very meaty a nice way to top off the meal. We plan to revisit to try different options. We also enjoyed the acoustic guitar playing in the background."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my friend based on the good reviews and wow, were we ever disappointed. We had to wait about 15 mins for a table which was fine. We ordered some nigiri sushi and sashimi to start. The salmon and tuna nigiri sushi were okay. The red tuna sushi tasted really bad and there was something off about it. The tuna sashimi was almost frozen and the salmon sashimi was okay. The maki rolls were okay - nothing special about them. I ordered seafood udon in hopes of washing away the awful red tuna taste in my mouth and had to remind them about it. l. When I got the udon, the broth tasted like \"plastic\" and it smelled bad. The beef ribs were dry. The oysters tasted like it was from a can and the deep fried scallop was burnt. They forgot 3 of our orders but we decided to not remind them because the food was not great. We also saw a waiter drop some napkins on the floor, pick them up and put them onto a pile of clean napkins!! Unacceptable. When we were about to pay, we were then told that they only accept VISA and Mastercard which was fine but I wished that they indicated that somewhere on their menu or in the restaurant. The customer service was not great. They don't tell you what the dish is when they bring it out and they don't really acknowledge you when you enter or leave. For the expensive price of this place, we expected better. Definitely will not be coming back and would never recommend this place to anyone.  tl;dr: food was bad and we saw a waiter put dropped napkins back into the pile of clean napkins"}
{"text":"For the price at lunch, I expected better.  The sashimi was served way too warm (eww), the nigiri was ok, and the tempura was gummy. Last thought is not food related, but they have the music up too loud for such a small place - the food servers can barely hear, and have to lean in really close so you don't have to shout!  The small sashimi plate, 3 orders of nigiri, and the tempura appetizer with 2 glasses of wine and a soda was over $70 at lunch. Bento box at Happy valley is MUCH better. Also, Kawaii Sushi is a touch farther but also terrific."}
{"text":"Quick service, very filling - with the actual fillings, not extra rice. Rolls appeared to have variety on paper, but really were the same 3-4 core ingredients with one or two changes. I didn't mind because I like all the classics, but if you're looking for super variety in rolls look elsewhere. The variety was everywhere else, though. Sashimi was good, the grilled and cooked was good, which is notable because often AYCE offer extras just to say they do. I should say though, some of the grilled items come with a char that I find tasty but you may consider burnt. I'd give all the ingredient quality an 8. Overall, it could be cheaper for what it was, but a satisfactory AYCE experience for when you really need it."}
{"text":"This place was really good, especially for an AYCE joint. The spicy salmon rolls are so delish! Everything we had was great (and we had a lot) with the exception of the shot ribs - they were a little dry, shriveled, and flavorless. The service was fast and friendly. The server checked in often and we never had to wait long for anything. Prices are super reasonable. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try Echo Sushi because it is right around the corner from my house. The sushi was tasty and fresh, slightly overpriced. The poke bowls are large and really great, I love getting them for lunch. The forbidden purple rice is a little off putting but it was good. I really wish they would consider a happy hour. Overall it is great to have a new sushi restaurant right around the corner."}
{"text":"I called this location prior to going as I knew it was a popular place so I wanted to see if I would need a reservation. The woman on the phone said it wasn't necessary as it would only be my sister and I.  Upon arrival, we had to wait 30 minutes to get a table, kind of annoying but we had a chance to look at the AYCE menu.   They served the food quickly. There was a good variety and unique combinations of flavours. Some of our favourites were the Echo roll and the Football roll.   Fish tasted very fresh and they had decent prices - $23.99/per person for AYCE.   I will go back but probably not as soon as parking was a pain in the butt and I don't live in that area! Very good!"}
{"text":"My friends/coworkers arrived here around 12 (right when it opened, we were literally waiting for the open sign to light up) and were seated immediately since we were the first ones there. Echo Sushi has not adopted the iPad ordering system so we used paper to record what we wanted. All the rolls and tempura were delicious. The food came out quickly and surprisingly (contradictory to other reviews), there was not a ton of rice with the sushi.  One note is that the potato and corn cake will catch you by surprise. Try it and you'll understand what I mean.  The desserts are limited, we were the first to order our ice creams but they already ran out of the red bean flavour for the day (which is a staple for all you can eat sushi restaurants)! I do like how they incorporated fried bananas and kiwi which I haven't seen before. Makes your dessert a little more fruity.  Almost everything was delicious and it was around $24 per person with tax and tips for their lunch AYCE menu.  Note: they only accept cash and credit, no debit. If you have debit, they'll direct you to the nearest bank/ATM and trust that you come back. I say if you don't have a friend to help you out, definitely bring cash/credit!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened. It's nice to have a restaurant this far north that isn't fast food. I stopped by tonight on a whim and I'm glad I did. The place is smaller but very nice and has a great atmosphere. The staff was very attentive and friendly. I ordered the sweet Hawaiian roll and the Las Vegas roll. Both were amazing! The sweet Hawaiian roll isn't sweet though. It's fairly spicy. They had my order ready within 10 minutes even though the place was busy. They also included 2 miso soups. This place is a gem and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten mixed reviews amongst my neighbors but I had a really good experience. I had the chirashi bowl and some eel nigiri. I actually don't mind the black rice (which looks purple). It tasted the same as white rice to me and it's better for you. I've seen complaints that it wasn't cold and I had the same experience. That's probably my only complaint. The fish was fresh and the pieces were cut appropriately. I've never seen fresh wasabi before so that was a nice touch. They have a good selection of wasabi. I was there for lunch and it came with miso and a salad. I liked both."}
{"text":"Came on a weekday for dinner ($24.99/person). The quality of sashimi was good, nothing too fishy and they are quite fresh. I also liked there was lots of maki rolls options on the menu. Other than that, lots of the menu items lacked flavour... dishes like teriyaki steak/chicken, cube beef w/garlic etc... were not the best I had.  The rice on the rolls and sushi was overcooked, leading it to became too soft, almost mushy texture. The vinegar on the rice overpowered a lot of the sushi dishes we ordered.   There was one staff serving and he was very friendly and accommodating. Another good thing was that the food came very quickly. This is an OK AYCE restaurant to go to if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, and great service. I go a couple times a week. Highly recommended. Carefree Special & Poke bowl are my favorite."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of AYCE sushi and they are mostly the same. You'll never find one  in GTA that serves truly fresh sashimi comparable to Japan (or even Vancouver). So I distinguish them by their menu selection mostly. Quality matters but most of them have been about the same, especially for sashimi. Most of them were frozen and you can tell because it's a little cool when you put in your mouth. Then price is also another factor.  Echo sushi is about average in terms of selection and about average for quality. You'll find your usual salmon/white tuna/red snapper/surf clam for sashimi, and similar choices for sushi but also with squid/fish eggs (small)/and some others. I don't recall any special items on their menu at all except for nicer looking desserts. You'll find almost everything on their menu at any other AYCE sushi place. I wanted them to have a grilled mackerel or saury on the menu.  Of all the things we tried, almost everything was good. The steak was a bit too heavy on garlic and tasted more Chinese than Japanese. The beef skewer was a bit overcooked. The rice portion on the sushi was fair. The grilled squid was excellent. The dumplings were ok. Spider roll was nice and crunchy inside. If I don't mention it, it was probably good.   Basically it's a very acceptable place for AYCE sushi. Every single AYCE will have its own flaws on select items. My only real complaint is the price. I can find cheaper AYCE sushi in the GTA. Echo is $25 for dinner on weekend. After tax and tip it's over $60 for 2 people. Lots of places have a cheaper regular price, and also give 10% off for paying cash. This puts Echo on the expensive side. If I happened to be in the area I would go. But it's not a place I would travel for. But this can be said about any other AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  That's the word for this gem.  My husband and I stopped by late this afternoon to try out this new neighborhood sushi place.  I'm not going to say I had high expectations, though I was hopeful.  They blew me out of the water, to the extent I'd say they are top 5 of any sushi restaurant I've been to anywhere in the country.  To put that in perspective, I am a sushi lover who travels weekly on business.  I'm adventurous enough to be willing to go out on a limb when I travel, but I've been disappointed a lot in search of great sushi.  The team at Echo have put together excellent, fresh fish, including blue fin tuna, paired it with black rice and fresh wasabi.  It literally explodes with flavor in your mouth.  We tried the yellowtail sashimi (melted on my tongue), the spicy tuna roll, the Philadelphia roll, the blue fin roll, crunchy California roll, and of course, the miso soup.  Bar none, everything was excellent.  We will be back again and again.  Go, and tell all your friends!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 6 years now. Always great service and the quality of fish is decent for AYCE! Prices have gone up slightly but that's to be expected, I'll be a frequent customer here for a long while yet :)"}
{"text":"Average food quality at a fairly high price and its very difficult to find parking....my biggest complaint is that the sushi is almost twice the size it should be, presumably to save them some work..."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a friend. We came here right when it opened at 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty busy. For an AYCE restaurant, I would give it a 3.5 if I could but I'll rate it on the higher end to a 4.0. Our items came out all at once and the server always filled our tea/water right away. The sashimi was fresh, however cut a little on the thicker side, some pieces were also weirdly cut like a diamond. The concept of the rolls were tasty but the rice used was a little too soft so it was mushy when you put it in your mouth. Most of the cooked items tasted decent however the portion sizes were much smaller than the usual buffet size. I was looking forward to the beef ribs but they came out overcooked and oily..pretty disappointed here. I must comment on the service, the sushi chefs and servers were friendly and attentive which is rare for an all you can eat restaurant. I would probably come back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and the food is always fresh and outstanding.  Love the salmon poke bowl!! They are always kind and provide great service and are patient with my oft-spilling toddler!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing and the staff was very attentive when explaining the menu! No complaints here! Definitely loved the black rice over the traditional white rice! Felt wayyyyy lighter."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today because we of Good Friday and were only allowed to consume fish (since all the fish and chips places were packed!).    Service was good, food was average (with little highlights and several lowlights) -- and for $19.99 (holiday price), would I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"Very small place (I went for lunch...not sure how he vibe is at night - can't imagine taking a big group with how small it is here...not sure), but very good food and wonderful service...and I mean WONDERFUL. Pricing is fantastic as well. 5-stars for sure."}
{"text":"I came to this AYCE because I wanted to try an AYCE downtown-ish.  So based on the reviews here, 80 reviews average at 4 stars..my family came here. but wow, were we disappointed.  Everything was sub-par considering the price of what I can get at other AYCE.  Let's compare: Sashimi - no squid, no sweet shrimp, no mackerel, no scallops,  Cooked food - no steamed eggs, no teppanyaki shrimp, no mussels, grilled salmon bellies, fried squid balls... no other kinds of noodles besides udon.. no baked seafood avacado...   basically, they don't have a lot for their price tag.. then add the additional parking fee  If you're looking for AYCE uptown, try ten-ichi (expensive but a wide variety of quality food, and you can request the items be served on a boat), or sushi on 7 (most economical at $19.99 - plus print 10% coupon from ccue.ca (chinese site, so if you can't read, just type sushi on 7 on their search bar)."}
{"text":"Love everything here. For your sure try Dumplings they have a fancy name for them.  Had the baked salmon roll. Yum. The Udon noodle soup is large but delicious. Oh and we loved the black rice just close your eyes people probably don't like it because it is different than the norm"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Friday lunch for the AYCE with 2 other coworkers. Overall we were quite satisfied with our meal, all of our orders were very accurate.   The rolls were a nice size, seaweed salad was good, tempura and sauce were excellent and also enjoyed the skewers.   What I thought were below average were the sushi pizza and some of the Grilled meat. It was okay, but not a fan of the sauce they used. It was a tad too sweet.   Good experience overall and would recommend anyone looking for an AYCE in that area."}
{"text":"Good sushi, good service. Not bad, but not wow I'm coming here every week. I would come again and it is worth trying if you are in the area. I would give 3.5 starts if I could."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and it is a decent sushi spot, especially for AYCE. The service is amazing here, as the servers are extremely nice and provide very speedy and consistent service.  I think what really stood out to me the first time I was here was the service, considering most places I've been to, downtown, takes long to prepare the food.  With that being said, on my second visit, I knew and expected the service to be fast, so I got the chance to really focus on the food this time. Most of the rolls I ordered tasted okay, but there was a lot of rice, which filled me up faster.  The AYCE weekday lunch was around $16-17 after tax, per person. Unfortunately, the commute from all the way on the other side of Eglinton, isn't worth it for me anymore, as I can find cheaper places downtown."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. Love stopping here at any time when I have to drive through. Customer service is also excellent. One of my favorite sushi spots."}
{"text":"One word I will forever associate with Echo Sushi is \"choice\". But it doesn't end there the sushi was very fresh. Probably the freshest sushi I have ever tasted in a AYCE sushi place. Everything was great the rolls, the Sashimi, and the small \"eats\" like the tempura battered veggies.  I would defiantly go back there and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of sushi. If you are one of those people who automatically poo poo AYCE sushi I urge you to try Echo Sushi, it might just change your mind.  Not only that the price is just right! It's definitely one of my must visits whenever I'm in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"If your in the area and want great sushi this is your place. It was so good I didn't even know I had fish eggs until I was done with my lunch. No doubt I will be back. 5 Star all the way!"}
{"text":"Wow! Some of the best sushi in or out of the Phoenix Valley! Poke bowls are excellent. Very fresh and the service is great."}
{"text":"These sashimi were fresh and well-fermented so i shouldn't criticize of it. Their service must be totally wrong. I could understand their limited English skill, but they didn't even escort tables when we stood up in front of door for 15 mins. Since I went there at first, I've seen that the owner always cooked. Last night, I saw that he was serving, but extremely unkind... when we ready to order, after he looked at us, suddenly shook his head negatively as well as he pushed us to pay faster. At that time, it wasn't crowded and we didn't order too many.  Before, I felt obviously uncomfortable with the service, last night was the worst day there. To be honest, if this restaurant wasn't \"All you can eat\" place, nobody wouldn't have needed to go there.   The owner must be change his attitude for customers, especially Asian and You don't forget about that you're also Asian. I sometimes saw he smiled western people."}
{"text":"I started typing this email as I sat down with my 20 month old daughter for dinner...and I'm finishing it 3 days later after recovering from a terrible bout of food poisoning. Now, I've eaten at Echo sushi a dozen times in the past and never gotten sick (either Celiac reaction or a bug) but obviously something was different this time. Also, I was put off by the $7.99 charge for my daughter to eat.   i don't think I'll be back there any time soon. The food is generally pretty tasty but this last experience was fairly unenjoyable from start to finish."}
{"text":"Used to go to this place often for All You Can Eat. We really liked it back then. But we came here last night for dinner with a couple of friends and this place has really gone down hill. The dynamite roll and beef enoki mushroom wraps were both bland. The spider roll was disgusting and it was cold. This was one if the only sushi restaurants we only go to. Unfortunately, this last visit left a disgusting taste in our mouths. Sadly, we won't be going here anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi and Ramen!  So glad we have a decent place in the neighborhood. I ordered the crunch California roll and seafood ramen. It was some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Well my review won't make any difference to anybody wanting to stuff themselves with farmed fish sushi for $30 but the owner appeared very grumpy, (it all comes from the top) the place was full of young folks coming for a deal and the sushi was average. Worst sushi pizza ever, sloppily rolled sushi and I felt as though I was in a factory. Shrimp tempura was good but teeny tiny. Avoid this place unless you're super cheap with low sushi standards."}
{"text":"Great selection for the AYCE, & most things tastes really well. Fish tastes fresh. One of my favs is Salmon tataki..  Despite the great food quality & taste, Would be nice if they work on the place setting.. fancier deco, dimmer lights in the evening... also we were sitting near the glass windows, cold was finding its way inside... we were feeling really cold!"}
{"text":"Echo Sushi is probably my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant in toronto. The fish is of very high quality, the selection is great and the service is incredibly fast. Unlike other AYCE places that don't bring everything you order, Echo brings everything - and super fast. Their salmon sashimi is great given that Toronto isn't near an ocean.  Must Haves:  - Salmon Sashimi - Spicy Chicken - Spicy Tuna Maki - A roll made with Brown Rice (it's more purple than brown and it's delicious.)  All in all, if you're looking for that AYCE experience, don't look further than Echo - heck, even their salad dressing is actually THE BEST. I have come many, many times and look forward to returning for many years."}
{"text":"Coming from Western North Carolina and traveling to the Grand Canyon, we were starving when we got off the airplane. We decided to stop at this place and it was the first of many great decisions we hope to make here. The sushi was fresh and tasty. I loved the miso soup and ginger salad served with it. We also had the spicy seafood noodle bowl which alone would make me was to go back. It had clams, mussels, shrimp, and little crawfish. It was a good spicy and not overwhelming. Will probably go back on our way back to Phoenix from the canyon!"}
{"text":"Amazing poke bowls!! Not much difference in quantity between the regular and deluxe though  Update: the amount of fish given has decreased over time.. disappointed"}
{"text":"We dropped by without a reservation tonight for dinner. We were greeted nicely a were seated quickly. The restaurant is brightly lit, clean and very busy. The service was prompt and efficient. The 2 sushi chefs were remarkably fast and their presentation was fairly good...especially considering their speed. We didn't know it was an AYCE   place but decided to order a la carte anyway. They were out of my favourite - Hamachi - but that can happen so I gave them a pass on that but the other fish in the sushi was average at best. We also shared a teriyaki steak which was rubbery and substandard.  I guess the AYCE standard is more about quantity than quality so if you're looking for a lot of average food at a set price this is the place for you. If you're looking for excellence try elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 or 4 times for lunch since opening and have typically ordered either the Spicy Seafood Raman Noodle soup or the Udon Tempura soup, and both are wonderful. Good, generous portions and friendly service."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and the restaurant was fairly busy.  Despite being a small restaurant, Echo Sushi had a cozy environment and attentive staff.  The AYCE menu included regular Japanese sushi staples like salmon sashimi (and several other types of sashimi), We also ordered Kalbi ribs, Salmon teriyaki, Chicken teriyaki, Tempura shrimp, Deep fried scallops, Udon noodles and an assortment of sushi / sushi rolls.  The fish tasted fresh, the food came fairly quickly and all the dishes were tasty.  Great food and excellent service.  The overall dining experience was excellent.  Overall: 4.2 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Usually when you go to a sushi restaurant for the all you can eat menu, well, you don't expect really good, different high quality sushi, you expect and \"ok\" sushi menu.  Let me tell you that here you will find -all you can eat and really good sushi.  I highly recommend it  I loved the spicy salmon by the piece  And all the unusual rolls  If you get too full the area it's nice to walk around :)"}
{"text":"Echo sushi is another jewel we found near Anthem. First time here , we were greeted by friendly staff. We ordered Yellow tail and salmon sashimi (so fresh ) grilled yellow tail collar (huge portion and delish ),mix tempura (tasty ) and don Katsu dinner (my husband is impressed with the black rice). Food were all dynamite!! Thank you and we look forward to try out more dishes at Echo sushi."}
{"text":"Great authentic sushi. Very fresh and quality choice of fish. The rice they use for the sushi fits perfectly and is above the norm in taste and quality. Definitely a hidden gem. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"After looking at countless sushi places midtown, and basing it on the reviews, Echo Sushi was our decision to try.   I must say that the interior of this is very warm, cozy, small with its Japanese themed decor.  The servers were very polite and extremely efficient. Though the ambience and service was rated a 4.5/5, the same can't be said for the food.   Our dishes that we ordered were beautifully presented but looks can be deceiving.  Both Iriana and I decided to share a few dishes: dynamite, California, Echo Sushi roll and mixed veg n shrimp tempura. First thing we both realized was the amount of rice used to make the rolls, it's disproportionate sizing was a bit of a turn off.  As well my echo sushi roll did not look appetizing that it began to fall apart as I tried picking it up with my chopsticks. The overall taste was ALRIGHT, their tempura was properly seasoned and fried.    Their prices are reasonable, however if you do not wish to order a la carte you can opt for AYCE (all you can eat). Echo sushi is mid range leaning towards my mediocre radar.  I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I order take out from this sushi restaurant at least once a week and I've noticed lately that the quality of the sushi is no longer as fresh as it used to be. Sometimes the fish is even room temp. Ick.   In addition, they keep forgetting certain items in my order. This happens at least once or twice a month. I often get the combo but they forget to give me my soup and salad. What's worse is when you call to tell them, they just tell you to swing by next time and they'll give it to me. What am I supposed to do with soup and salad on a random day? Makes no sense.  Anyway, not coming back again. I will get my sushi fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good place to try specialty rolls. Salmon and ginger roll make up for no sashimi. They even have brown rice rolls too.   Make sure you only order what you like. They charge you for leftovers."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, I am on the fence about the dark rice. The fish seems of good quality and the poke bowls are large and tasty. I wish they had some happy hour sushi specials but I understand why they do not. I am just glad I can get fairly good sushi in my area now without having to go 20-30 minutes."}
{"text":"Went there again today. For someone reason, the sushi wasn't very fresh. In fact, the avocado's in the sushi's that I ordered looked really old and seemed to have oxidized. Also got some spicy beef udon this time instead of the eel hot pot rice and the beef was not spicy at all."}
{"text":"Extremely efficient service and I'd say they have the best AYCE Sushi menu in Toronto.  That's all I have to say because they don't need anything else."}
{"text":"Echo Sushi is officially added to my list of great sushi restaurants in this great city we all call Toronto!  I had my first experience at this restaurant tonight but I was very impressed with the freshness and quality of the fish and veggies in the sushi rolls I hungrily devoured.  My friend and I decided to go for the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI option, but what makes Echo Sushi so smart is that they offer 4 different levels of ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI so you are able to either pay a cheap rate for amazing sushi or go a level or two higher to get insane stuff like octopus.  I selected the first level (BUFFET A) and I had a ton of things to choose from.  In the end, I ordered with my friend the following rolls, which were delicious:  - Rainbow Roll - Catepillar Veggie Roll - Spicy Salmon Roll - Fire and Ice Roll - Firecracker Roll - Red Dragon Roll  In addition to the large selection, you can get any roll in hand roll or sushi roll format.   As well, they offer up a ton of appetizers like warming miso soup, crunchy green salad and tons of green tea and water to go around.  The total cost for my meal tonight was $13.99.  This is what I call AMAZING for sushi that was delicious and for a menu that had pages of options to pick from."}
{"text":"Wow! Thank you Tramonto for bringing in another REAL restaurant! (Don't need anymore chains!). Echo is great! Fine Sushi dining and great prices! Tyler and Caytlin were great servers with knowledgeable recommendations! Had baked mussels and the Carefree sushi special (with purple rice!). What a great meal and experience! Happy Tramonto residents!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 6pm. AYCE dinner is $22.99.   Faves: - grilled squid. Juicy and tender and made just perfect - shrimp tempura - light on the batter and seriously delicious - deep fried oysters... Holy shizaaaahhhhh. So yummy and these guys are FAT - deep fries calamari - not bland and stringy like some places, seasoned to purrrfection. - sashimi - fresh and big pieces but the white tuna was a little cold. Hurt my teeth...  Mehs: - rolls. Too much rice, rice is a little warmer than I like and a little falling apart-ey - galbi. What the hell, I didn't order jerky!?!? They were over grilled and not fatty at all just thin and very dry. Disappointed.  - hand rolls. Too much rice. 168 is the only place that does hand rolls right, these were stuffed with rice  Seeing how most people go to AYCE sushi for the maki rolls I would say this wasn't my best experience. I peeled off like a pound of rice by the end of our meal... But it's a decent place if nothing else is close by.   Service was really really really REEAAALLLYYY fast. Our first order came within 10 min (if you know me you know it was a big order...). Servers was sweet as pie too and spoke Engriiish."}
{"text":"Everything I tried was very fresh, and service was quick even though the restaurant was busy. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I looove their sushi! Everything I've had in the four times we e eaten there since they opened has been amazing and the black rice is fantastic. Best fried rice too!"}
{"text":"Moved from Toronto to Vancouver figuring we wouldn't have a problem replacing our normal bi weekly sushi place echo sushi.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  We have tried numerous places in the sushi Mecca and none of them touch the overall value proposition of echo sushi.  We can't wait to be back for a visit and see our old friends."}
{"text":"I went to echo sushi during lunch time on Saturday. When we went at around 2, there wasn't a line up. They have increased the Lunch ayce price to $17.99.  The food selection was mediocre. Their best dishes were their sushi. The grilled food were ok.  Service is at par but we were not looking for amazing service at an all you can eat restaurant.  I wouldn't go back again because there are better restaurant with more food options at this price point."}
{"text":"A great all you can eat sushi place. The format should be familiar by now. You get a tick sheet, indicate which items you want, they bring it to you, and you can get another tick sheet when you're done and order more. The trick to some of these places is getting the items you've actually ticked.   Echo Sushi nails it. Their weekend AYCE is more expensive than a couple previous places I've reviewed but it's worth it. There's a more extensive salad and dessert menu. Fried banana and ice cream? Mmmm. And the avocado salad was a nice change from the salad with soy/vinegar/ginger dressing you usually get at a sushi restaurant.  Service is prompt, attentive, but not effusive or hovering. The items you tick, you get. The salmon and avocado roll was mind blowingly awesome.   It's a fairly small joint. Nothing fancy schmancy here either. But what really matters is the food and service and variety and they nail it nicely."}
{"text":"A decent sushi all-you-can-eat place. Lunch is about $21 including tax and tips.  The ingredients - rice, seaweed, raw fish - taste fresh to me (which is not true at every restaurant I've been to). The wait service is decent speed, and the restaurant is small and cozy. The menu has a comfortable selection of sushi, hand rolls, teriyaki, other things I forgot, and a small handful of dessert items.  Owners and employees appear to be Cantonese-speaking."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place!! They have awesome poke bowls, awesome sushi, and an awesome staff. I would eat here every single day if I could!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for lunch on a busy Saturday and were a bit disappointed given the rave reviews on Yelp. The sushi rolls were decent but they were lacking flavour so we asked for spicy mayo (helped a lot!). The beef ribs were extremely overcooked, stiff and dry and I love beef ribs so I asked for another dish of that cooked medium rare and they came back with another dish of beef ribs just as overcooked! The beef teriyaki was also overcooked which was disappointing. To add to that, why is the sushi shaped like a male part?! I thought it was quite humorous and I'm sure they didn't intend for it at all.   Good things about Echo Sushi was the service was excellent - servers were very attentive of our table and served water and tea quickly! The teriyaki salmon as delicious but I seem to like anything salmon. The garlic beef dish was amazing - I have never ate a dish like that before! Lastly, the udon was actually quite yummy. To be honest though, I probably won't come here again considering there are better and cheaper sushi places in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came to Echo Sushi because a good friend of mine insisted on going to an all-you-can-eat restaurant to satisfy his appetite and profuse hunger, and the Mandarin at Yonge and Eglinton was closed.  We ended up at Echo based on his recommendation.  They didn't give me the option to choose from the dinner menu, since the whole table needs to decide on one or the other.  I suppose this makes sense to prevent sharing, but I feel like giving that option to their patrons would make the atmosphere feel more welcome and comfortable.  The service was good, but one of the servers seemed to be confused about specific items and their ingredients.  I think educating the server staff to have a better understanding of the items they are serving would help provide a more enjoyable dining experience.  Overall the food was average, and although it wasn't anything to write home about, I have no complaints.  I enjoyed the short beef ribs and beef teriyaki in particular, and overall had an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Sushi was fresh.  Spicy pork bento box was way spicy and delicious.  They have non-rice sushi rolls!  They use black rice, not typical sushi rice.  Supposed to be healthier and lower in carbs.  The atmosphere was modern and very clean.  Service was great, quick and friendly.  So excited to have great sushi this close!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! The quality is very good and the AYCE menu has many, many options. The lunch AYCE price is good, but the dinner AYCE price, especially on weekends, is on the expensive side. Otherwise, a great sushi restaurant, and one of my favorites in the city."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time at Echo Sushi and each time has been a great experience. The food, service, and prices are all excellent. My husband and I each had the bento box lunch. It's a large portion of food that comes with gyozo, rice, sushi, choice of meat, soup, and salad. We're stuffed! It's so wonderful to finally have somewhere to eat in this area that isn't owned by a chain."}
{"text":"Awesome AYCE - my fave in the city. First of all, the service is good - sometimes they forget a roll, but they are generally friendly and helpful and don't give you attitude about their mistakes.   The sushi is delicious, the fish is fresh, they have some fun rolls I haven't seen before, and the price is very, very right. They generally do groups really well, even though it's a small place. The only thing is that the menu doesn't actually have descriptions of all the sushi on the ordering card - but hey, it's an adventure that way."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints everytime I come here for their ayce. It is my number 1, to-go, ayce sushi restaurant. I would recommend this place. Sashimi is usually fresh. Quality is always on point. My Olde faithful."}
{"text":"Another sushi place overrated.  When it comes to sashimi, the freshness of the fish it's very important. I'll admit salmon was pretty good, but everything else not so much.   Sushi was good, but average. At some point there was way too much rice around (Something common from AYCE sushi places)   Other thing I noticed was that the prices weren't updated. So when you go inside and sit down they bring you the menu and surprise! it's 2 dollars more expensive than expected. In my opinion it was overpriced, we paid 28 each.     Overall was an \"okay\" experience."}
{"text":"Husband and I wanted to go out for a quick lunch and chose Echo because we liked it before. He ordered the salmon bento box and it looked awesome! He said it tasted great too! (I'm vegetarian so I didn't try it) we will always come back great service too."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi is known in general to have mediocre food and atmosphere. This place actually is very good at both. Echo is a really good place in general, it's pretty much my go-to for a nice AYCE sushi lunch or dinner.   The facility is small-ish, and it's not massive like some of the other AYCE sushi restaurants. The sushi itself is fresh and tasty, and you have a wide variety with better quality, especially at dinner. They have this dish called Hot Pot (not like Chinese hot pot), where you have beef or chicken in a hot bowl with rice. My mom likes it, she orders it every time we go there.  The location can be easily missed while going along Yonge Street, so make sure you have your GPS for those of you are driving or who are directionally challenged. Just a tip: Look for Lola Road while you're driving, you can even sometimes get parking there!  My favourite AYCE sushi spot by far. Never had a bad experience here. Check it out! :D"}
{"text":"Always delicious and high quality! They served fresh wasabi the last time we went, and it was fantastic. The black rice adds a nutty flavor to all the rolls."}
{"text":"I love this place I've tried various ayce sushi places but the quality matched the price. This place is better. Must try. It can get busy."}
{"text":"Take-out review:   Food: the food here is great especially their rolls. Hands down they have the best rolls at this price range. They even allow you to customize some of the rolls. The spicy tuna roll was well priced and you get a good portion the food also comes out pretty fast. Overall this place is very good for sushi take-out in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the north valley by far. Poke bowl is amazing, highly recommend echo tower too."}
{"text":"Another great trip to Echo. Staff are always friendly and the sushi is fresh and unique. Love the black rice! Rolls are made with it too. Don't let it scare you. Tastes great and it sets this place apart. Nice and casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overall, not a bad place for all you can eat sushi. It's really one of the only acceptable all you can eat sushi places in the area. While there are better sushi restaurants in the area that aren't ayce, all you can eat is sometimes a must when being with certain friends and keeping in mind certain budgets. The sashimi and sushi itself was pretty good. Fresh enough, not too fishy. The addition of brown rice sushi was a nice touch that you can't usually find anywhere else. Teriyakis we're good as well. I was a little confused about the potato and corn pancake, usually it's more like a hash brown than anything, but I SWEAR if u close ur eyes and don't see you're having potatoes and corn it tastes like a boston cream donut. Haha not sure how I felt about that. Sushi pizza is a pass, green peppers in it threw off the flavour of the eel. Shrimp tempura could've been better. Scallop sushi, scallop tempura all of the scallops were great. Would I go again if I had to get ayce in that area? Yes. Do I think it's worth 26 dollars on a weekday dinner. No."}
{"text":"This was truly an incredible experience from beginning to end nothing but genuine politeness from the whole staff. The black rice is now my favorite thing, the fried rice was very hot and tasty. All the rolls were fresh and delicious! I loved this place and will be returning frequently. The Ramue beverage was perfectly ice Cold which is exactly how it should be. Even as someone who doesn't enjoy fish that much I was able split a spicy tuna roll with my Mickey Mouse action figure that I went to this special restaurant with. Highly recommended!   Thank you! Ill be recommending you to everyone :)"}
{"text":"It was an accidental spot that we found to eat. In general, I love sushi, and this place was a great stop  first, I have never tried black rice sushi, so I was happy to try it- tasted well! Second, the food came fast and fresh. The place wasn't massive nor small. I would like to come back here and try other things on the menu.  Try it!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try out Echo Sushi based on the reviews, however, we were extremely disappointed when we left the restaurant. Here are the reasons why:  - the oyster tasted like it was from a can - the salmon and tuna sashimi were almost frozen - the tuna and salmon sushi were good, nothing special - 5 of the items were never brought out - we saw a waiter drop a brand new napkin and chopsticks on the floor, pick them up and put them back on the new pile of fresh napkins and chopsticks! - the deep fried scallop tasted burnt  There are way better AYCE sushi places out there and for a much a cheaper price. Also, there's no sign saying they don't accept debit and we were told right when we were about to pay.   We definitely won't be returning to Echo Sushi and we would not recommend this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"Great place n deco. Quick serve n get to try different sushi that u don't c from regular sushi place."}
{"text":"Despite what some people have said the staff are super friendly, the food is great and they are the freshest sushi I have had in awhile. I went around to find different places in the neighbourhood and none of them compare to these guys."}
{"text":"My partner and I love Echo.  The sushi is very fresh and the AYCE menu is quite extensive, with many creative maki.  Teriyaki is also excellent here.  The tempura is crisp and tasty.  Brown rice maki is also on the AYCE menu for a change of pace.  Spend the extra bucks for the \"B\" menu - there are many more choices including sashimi, if you are watching carbs.  The ark clams taste really fresh here as does the white tuna.  Servers are very polite and pleasant and much more attentive than in many AYCE sushi venues.  Green tea ice cream with kiwis is a nice dessert offered with the AYCE menu.  Very busy on weekends."}
{"text":"Shrimp tempura- single layer of batter.you can actually taste the juicy shrimp. I usually don't eat shrimp tempura..but this place.  Made me eat 4  Salmon sushi- perfect. Not too much rice  Worth the extra 2bucks for lunch ayce."}
{"text":"I came across Echo sushi after having my 2 year old discriminated before seating at Sushi Rock in the same neighborhood.  Echo Sushi is small and they can get busy, but food is very good and the all-you-can eat is cheaper than the previously mentioned restaurant in the area. Staff is attentive and my friend's daughter got free ice cream when ordered a la carte! Nice touch. I'm so glad I discovered this tucked away restaurant! My new go-to sushi place!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy a night out at least once per month. My wife and I prefer the echo tower and the my children like the shrimp tempura. Can't forget the Gyoza. delicious."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why people say this is the best AYCE sushi in the city. The sushi came out super fast, which is awesome, but the service was subpar and the food was just okay. The rolls I had were bland and made with way too much rice, which I hate to see AYCE places do. I think it's dishonest, in a way, to fill people up with inexpensive rice so they'll order fewer rolls.  I left this restaurant pretty full, but not very satisfied."}
{"text":"If you want *good* AYCE sushi, there really isn't anywhere else to go (for under $25). Echo doesn't get everything right, so part of the fun is knowing what they do get fresh - and that is the salmon frickin' sashimi. Honestly, order a ton of that and whatever maki rolls you please (firehouse and jade dragon are 2 of my faves, but they are all ) and you won't be disappointed. I've had the salmon every single time I've gone and my visits have numbered close to a dozen times a year. Echo hasn't missed a beat in that dept.  As to what to avoid...I wouldn't waste time or stomach space with the tuna. But seriously, if you want good tuna, you shouldn't be going to an AYCE joint"}
{"text":"A lil bit pricey compares to other AYCE, but the food is well worth it. Fresh fish, crispy tempura with just right amount of breading, fast and friendly service, huge selection of food for dinner. One of my favorite places in the city!"}
{"text":"My new go-to spot for sushi. Tried 4 rolls, some traditional sushi, some cooked dishes and desserts with a buddy. All of the fish was noticeably fresher than the majority of sushi spots in Arizona and the mixed tempura and sesame chicken were both served hot and crispy, but not greasy, and flavor was on point. As for dessert, get it to go box and make sure you save room for their tempura green tea ice cream. Basically to sum it up, everything was beyond expectation, from the quality of the food to the friendly service. As for the people complaining about the price, yes it may be SLIGHTLY above average but when you get food quality that's greatly above-average, isn't that a more than fair trade off? The only suggestion I've heard people making I would agree with is a happy hour would be nice. I would probably be in there 5 days a week if they had it. Hahaha. Nothing but positive to say about this place though and can't wait to continue visiting"}
{"text":"Holy crap!!!! THIS IS THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANT IN NORTH PHOENIX.  Everything is amazing from the rolls to the sashimi!!!!!  I would highly recommend to anyone who like sushi"}
{"text":"This was a hard review for me to write. The sushi was great, very fresh good fish. The menu options looked good and everything I ordered was delicious.   Our server Branden was so polite and gave us great service. My huge complaint was who I think was the manager, she never came up to us, but I could hear her yell at the two servers and the sushi chefs constantly. Branden was nothing but nice but he seemed a little nervous (I would be to if I had a manager picking at my every move). I mean everything these two servers did was wrong in her opinion and she would yell and be rude to these two guys. I was in shock that she treated her employees in such a horrible way IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS. it's a pretty small place but we were sitting at the table farthest from the server station and we could hear her yelling. I find it so unprofessional.   I would love to say the manager was just having a bad day but my mother (who was with me and took me there) went a week before and said it was the same thing.   Like I said before the food was great and the servers were better but the manager needs to go before she runs off all her employees."}
{"text":"I \"echo\" the TOO MUCH RICE comments. It's a ridiculous amount both in the maki rolls and the nigiri sushi.   However, THE GRILLED MEATS were heavenly, and I recommend the AYCE just to get your fill on them. Everything else was quite good. I don't really have any complaints, other than the ridiculous amount of rice.   I will definitely return for the grilled and fried meats."}
{"text":"Excellent and unique sushi. All their rolls are made with black rice. The poke bowl was delicious.  Highly recommend the lemon roll."}
{"text":"Echo has great cheap lunch specials (bento boxes for $7 - $8) but the real reason to come here is the All You Can Eat menu.  I prefer to go at lunch.  The price is great (about $13 on weekdays and $15 on weekends) and the selection is awesome.  They don't have sashimi at lunch but they do have a wide selection of sushi, handrolls, and maki.  They also have a huge assortment of hot items.  My most favorite of the non-sushi items:  avocado seaweed salad, tempura shrimp, garlic beef, beef ribs, and teriaki salmon.  There are also a few desserts:  ice cream (vanilla, mango, or green tea), ice cream with kiwi, ice cream with tempura banana, and mango pudding.  The mango pudding is awesome and the mango ice cream goes well with the tempura banana.  The dinner selection is a little different as you get to choose between Menu A or Menu B, with one of them being about $3 more expensive but including sashimi.  I think the dinner prices are about $20 - $25, depending on weekday or weekend.  Regardless of lunch or dinner, if you choose to go with All You Can Eat, you will be given a pen and order form to place your order, and then your food will start coming.  Once you're done your first round of food, they will give you another order form.  The service is incredibly efficient, and I guess maybe some people could confuse it with rudeness.  The servers don't make small talk that's for sure - they really only speak if you ask them a question.  But they bring your food and clear your plates so fast your head will spin. I do have two annoyances:  One, the food comes in a totally random order, so it is not uncommon for example to get your tempura shrimp before you get your salad.  Second, on the order form you have to indicate the quantity of each item.  It's obvious how this works when ordering maki rolls or a salad - if you want two red dragon rolls, you write \"2\".  But on the other items, the quantities are a wild guess.  If you order \"1\" calamari, you get two tiny rings.  But if you order \"1\" spicy chicken, you get a big dish of breaded chicken that will make it hard for you to finish your meal.  They really need to standardize what it means to order 1 of something.  I have been there many times and still struggle to remember sometimes if \"1\" is a lot of something or just a little bit.  Having said that, this is great value and you can find me here for lunch at least 2 or 3 times a month."}
{"text":"Echo Sushi was so packed on a weekday afternoon that my boyfriend and I waited for a few minutes before we got seated. Sniffing the air, my boyfriend announced that it smelled strangely like sweat, but besides this alarming fact everything else in this restaurant was awesome.   We got a checklist of the food we would like to order, and the menu had lots of variety (except they didn't have sashimi). It consisted of maki rolls, nigiri, teriyaki, skewers, tempura and desserts. There were less brown rice options compared to white rice, but to have brown rice at no extra cost was very generous already. You either get EIGHT maki rolls or SIX, and they all taste pretty great. I was not fond of Echo Sushi Roll, however, which was 90% mayonnaise and 10% salmon.   If you order calamari or fried banana, the portions are very tiny. They are basically side-dish size. To sum it up, if you order anything that is NOT sushi, the portion will be small.   On a weekday, including tax and tip, we each paid $20 for AYCE. Not bad, considering we ate enough to feed a small country. I would come back if I was in the area again!"}
{"text":"I've been to many AYCE sushi restaurants and this one deserves 2.5 stars.  Considering the location and lack of competition in the area, it's decent enough.  There are better AYCE sushi restaurants north of the city though.  Three of us came here for dinner on a Sunday due to convenience and extreme hunger. I've actually been here twice. The first time was several years ago but the only thing I remember was that it was an average AYCE restaurant. This time around, I had the opportunity to assess better.  The variety and options were good. The size of the shrimp tempura were embarrassingly tiny. I had noticed that the beef dishes, including the garlic and beef and the short ribs were small pieces as well. The spicy udon noodles were good, with chewy textured noodles. The rice from the maki rolls were a bit plain and tasteless. The salmon sashimi tasted fresh. They didn't have a lot of sashimi options though.  The service was very good though. They were attentive, food came quickly, and our tea cups were always filled. The price was about the same as any other AYCE restaurant, which was $24.95 per person on a weekend for dinner."}
{"text":"Great service Tyler waited on me he did a great job and he was very Knowledgeable about the menu. Clean new restaurant. Prices were reasonable well priced. They use forbidden black rice for all there rolls, at first it might throw you a loop but it's very good tasting and very healthy full of antioxidants and vitamin E. Overall great new place I do recommend it and I Wil be back."}
{"text":"Used to have better quality food but the last couple years with price rising and quality decreasing I stopped returning back."}
{"text":"I have high expectations when it comes to sushi having lived in Japan for two years and downtown LA for four. I can best describe this as a watered down sushi joint that panders to people who don't know any better. The food is gross and overpriced. Take a drive south and go to one of the places closer to central PHX."}
{"text":"First visit: Had Chirashi bowl, excellent with lots of sashimi. Tempura side was excellent. Salad was excellent.  Bento dish was so-so. The gyoza was not to our taste, the skin was too thick. The teriyaki chicken was too sweet for our taste. But lots of food.  Second visit: Had the spicy seafood ramen very good ( it was very spicy ) large and tasty. Combination Tempura was excellent ( batter was perfect ) salad was excellent again."}
{"text":"Echo Sushi is a great place to go if you want to stuff your face with medium grade sushi. I used to stuff my face with their medium grade sushi all the time. I recently went to stuff my face with their medium grade sushi and it costed me a bit more to do so thanks to inflation - it's OK though, I can't complain about that. Out of all the all you can eat (AYCE) places, this is probably one of the best.   For each of their \"dragon\" rolls, I would price it out at as a $8 equivalent at a non-AYCE location. I would price out their normal rolls at $4 a roll. Assuming that each dragon roll has a 20% lower 'value' to you than the last (declining balance method), you would need to eat 6 dragon rolls to get your money's worth. Now, the question is - can you eat 6 dragon rolls?  When you get there, be sure to expect the typical AYCE sushi experience. That is, long wait times, lots of rice (which Echo actually doesn't fully pack on the rice relative to some places), and servers who do not give you what you clearly indicated on your order sheet.  Their medium grade sushi would start off as top-medium grade sushi and then come down to lower-medium grade sushi near the end. It was at this location that I was able to crush 12 pieces of Eel Avocado rolls (New York Roll excl. Cream Cheese) in under 9 seconds. I would recommend against getting any hand-rolls (in general and from Echo Sushi) as they are packed with rice and will not allow you to maximize your eating ability for the night."}
{"text":"Love it. Black rice is delicious! Wife and I  been here several times and love it. Tempura was not fresh though."}
{"text":"I went to this place twice for all you can eat sushi.  It was recommended by a friend.  The place was great, you wouldn't think that a sushi place this far away from all the others would be so good but it is!  Like other reviewers have said, the selection is stellar and they don't put too much rice or other fillers in their rolls. I like the option of having brown rice with the sushi too!  The thing is, if you ask for brown rice in substitution for an item that normally has white rice, the server will tell you they charge extra for that.  That's definitely a con.  I like their fruit with ice cream desert too, but again if you ask for extra fruit, that's an extra charge. Regardless of that though, I still really like this place and have ventured via TTC twice, and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Ok so I have a weird relationship to sushi. I love sushi, but cannot eat the raw fish! So what I usually go for is vegetarian sushi and tempura. Not being able to eat the sashimi limits the selection significantly. However, at Echo Sushi I found a good alternative to the regular cucumber or avocado maki. They have a red rice sushi filled with avocado and cucumber which tastes delicious. The red rice is healthier and has a crunch to it. It was a nice change to the regular makis. However, with that said I wish the sushi places could have a bigger selection of vegetable sushi and/or sushi with cooked chicken/fish etc. There are many people who like sushi but cannot eat raw fish because of allergies. I wish there could be a bigger selection for people like me. With that said I give this place 3,5 stars."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to give this place a go for our traditional New Year's Eve sushi dinner. They use black rice (looks purple) in their sushi which is a bit sweeter. We ordered 4 rolls (3 pictured), some gyoza and of course had miso soup to start with.   First things first, the service was really wonderful. Everyone from the server to the chef were smiling and we were greeted the moment we crossed the threshold. The small restaurant was actually about half full already but we were seated and didn't wait a minute before menus were in our hands and drink orders taken. Also I should mention our hot green tea kettle was never empty...  The miso came out not long after our order was placed, followed quickly with piping hot gyoza. A great start so far.   The sushi came out fast, but one roll at a time which was perfect. We hadn't finished one before the next was placed on the table. Not only did they taste great but the presentation was excellent as well.   We will definitely be returning and I highly recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone that happens to visit the north valley. 5 Stars, no complaints."}
{"text":"I I enjoy having this restaurant close to home. It has a nice cozy atmosphere.  I usually go for lunch and get the Bento box which is a ton of food, enough for lunch and dinner. I had never had black rice prior to this, it was fine and if it is better for me then why not? I think it is worth a try.  --"}
{"text":"Weekday lunch.  $15.99 for all-you-can-eat sushi is a bit expensive, but I feel like the premium is well worth it.  The sushi and rolls are small, but they pack quite a lot of fish in. The salmon rose was good, as were the salmon sushi. The soft shell crab in the spider roll was mostly crunchy soft shell and had little crab meat. The spicy salmon wasn't very spicy, nor was the spicy salmon dragon roll. Our top pick here is the spicy salmon dragon roll - we liked it enough that we ordered 3 of these rolls. The roll is filled with salmon and avocado, then topped with alternating strips of salmon and eel and drizzled with spicy mayo sauce.  What we did note about the sushi was that the presentation was poor and in some rolls, the rice did fall apart (eg. the salmon rose). The salmon sushi was also handled a bit roughly, the meat was not smooth and had small splits when pushed onto the rice.  The beef shortribs (eg. kalbi beef) listed under teriyaki was incredibly charred, oily and not worth ordering at all. The enoki beef mushrooms were good.  Service was good for all-you-can-eat sushi standards. The staff were happy to tell us what the rolls were, and to bring us extra ordering sheets and take away dishes. However, when we were first seated we were provided a booth in the back left corner that had lots of fruit flies buzzing around overhead. We asked to be seated near the front and were accommodated.   No WiFi. Look for free parking on Duplex Ave. parallel to Yonge St."}
{"text":"Man this place was awesome. I went for a mid-week lunch and the service was instant and the fish was nice and fresh. You definitely will not be disappointed when you come here. I was even able to find free parking on a side street. Score!  One thing they really could improve is that tattered old banner hanging out front, makes the place look like a hole in the wall from Yonge St."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The service great. Servers and sushi chefs are so kind and always have a smile. Clean, never too busy. Not one of those really big AYCE sushi places, quite cozy.  One time, we came an hour before opening (dinner). Even though we were both starving, we waited - trust me it's worth the wait. They also have beef sashimi!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi!  This small sushi restaurant is the real deal in the desert.  The raw fish is incredibly fresh and the cooked rolls are extravagant.  I ate here twice in one week and will be back on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is great - beats Au-So on originality . Rolls are on black rice (healthier) and fresh raw wasabi. Try the Kama appetizer either the Salmon or Yellowtail . They also have a different version of the Poke salad, again pretty good! Try the cold saki as well!  PS Dragon Roll (boom) it's different too!  Very original"}
{"text":"Excellent food, so glad to have a great sushi place this far north of Phoenix...Ebisu is DOA, have been looking for a new place for a while. Echo fills the spot. Shout out to our waiter, Tyler...high five buddy. Quick service, good food, cozy environment, great food (and sake). Two thumbs way up"}
{"text":"really dont understand the good reviews? Miso soup was way too salty...which is weird since it tastes like the powdered kind so I don't get how you mess up following the instructions for making it?   Specialty maki rolls were big which is fine, but had too much rice and I think the rice may have been over cooked because chewing a piece of the roll felt like chewing a big ball of gum or mochi....   Only thing going for this place is its low price. $10 for lunch set of miso soup, salad and two maki rolls (dynamite and tuna)"}
{"text":"After reading some poor reviews I was hesitant to try Echo but I am pleased to say it was a wonderful experience.  My first tip would be book it advance as we did have to wait an hour to be seated but it was a Saturday night. That was the only downside.  Food was super fresh and tasty. Loved the large menu with lots of different options I had never tried before. Seriously loved it all from the sushi to the sashimi.  Once seated service was quick and friendly. Food came out fast.  Would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to go for All-you-can-eat sushi. I've  been here multiple times. The sashimi is fresh and my favorite is the mackeral and white tuna; it is highly recommended. We ordered the dragon roll and it wasn't that great. But, the hand rolls and tempura are delicious; we had shrimp and oyster tempura, and spring roll.   Nice and cozy spot!"}
{"text":"Echo Sushi is amazing! The staff is wonderful and the food is great ! Damon is the best server ever!"}
{"text":"Honestly don't understand why this place has a 4 star rating. Poor service and medicre sushi. Sashimi was still frozen, if you have sensitive teeth it will bother you with every bite. Pricey for it's quality. Came here on a Sunday evening for AYCE dinner - 28.99 each."}
{"text":"We had the all you can eat and it was just okay and given the quality the price was a bit unreasonable.  Nothing amazing but not despicable either.  Service was great so for that they get the extra star.    The meat on a stick was dry and maybe deep fried so it was tough and chewy.  Short ribs were equally tough.  Sushi, sashimi, maki  were alright, nothing memorable though.  We're not going back, because the food isn't worth going back for."}
{"text":"When it comes to AYCE, you can count me out most of the time because I just feel as if the quality isn't the same + you just end up stuffing yourself to get your money's worth. Being a self-proclaimed food critic, I expect 2 things - good service and GREAT FOOD.  Have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised about the decent quality in some of their menu items (P.S IMO, you should never have expectations for AYCE, it is usually a hit/miss. Just expect to be full :) ) For helpful tips/what to order/pricing, please look below - this is going to be a long review, but it will be helpful, so get some popcorn/desert while reading this!  Review: 3.8/5 - For AYCE sushi, I believe you will be genuinely happy with the quality if you order the items I strongly recommend below. I'm not saying all their menu items are great, but please temper your expectations with AYCE - it's meant to be fast so they can keep serving you, thus, quality takes a hit!   Ordered - please also refer to my pictures!  1) Shrimp Tempura  - very thin, a little different from other places because there is less batter on this 2) BBQ Eel - this is like the 2nd best thing my friend and I ordered, **RECOMMEND** 3) Sashimi - if you don't like Makis. get this - White Tuna + Red Tuna **RECOMMEND** - Salmon is medicore 4) Mackarel - OMG, the most flavourful piece of sushi. My friend and I absolutely loved it that we had a lot of these **RECOMMEND** 5) Surf Clam - texture-wise, not as rubbery/chewy likes the ones I have had. If you like less chewy, get this 6) Red Dragon (comes in 6 - Maki) - pretty dry to say the least, was our least favourite - mediocre 7) Fried Oyster - surprise, surprise, they took the oyster out of the shell and actually fried it - try it 8) Mushrooms wrapped in beef - mediocre to me, friend enjoyed it. I thought the beef lacked taste. Teriyaki sauce on it made up for the flavour 9) Chicken Skewers - same as the beef, nothing special. Again, I thought this lacked flavour 10) Seaweed Salad - very generous with their portion. If you like it, don't order to much of it before you start. Trust me, it wouldn't be a wise decision on your part if you ordered big orders of sushi 11) Ice cream/fried banana - they only have 3 types of ice cream: Green Tea, Mango, Coconut - tried Mango/Green tea and they were quite good **RECOMMEND** - fried banana - not a lot of places have this, get this **RECOMMEND**  Overall, I was pleased with the sushi experience despite being skeptical at first. Despite coming here for dinner at 8:30pm on a Friday night, the restaurant was at full capacity and we were lucky enough to get a seat. Sushi orders came quite quickly.  WARNING - there is no waiting area, so be prepared to stand if you are waiting for a table. Would I come here again? YES, pretty good AYCE, only thing is, I don't like to travel so far to eat unless I'm driving haha  We ordered some additional items, but this review is quite long, SORRY, but thanks for reading/hope this helps. Below are some helpful tips for you!  HELPFUL HINTS/TIPS - Address: 2036 Yonge Street (TTC: Eglinton station - we ended up walking south on Yonge for about 10 mintues. About a 3 min walk from St. Louis Wings Price: Mon-Thurs dinner $25.99, Fri-Sun/Holiday = $27.99 for dinner  - Seating: It is a small restaurant and it seats less than 85 people. Good for big groups between 4-6. Have about 5 booths, 3-4 tables of 2's - Walk-ins: very helpful - they do not have a waiting area so if there are no seats, be prepared to stand!  - Methods of Payment: Beware - they DO NOT accept debit. They only accept cash, Visa & Mastercard (NO AMEX) - Wi-fi: Sorry, if you are running out of data on your mobile plan, you are out of luck. NO WI-FI!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a sushi bar in my neck of the woods, thought I'd give it a try. One of the other reviews mentioned loud music that made me a little leery, but I'm VERY glad I decided to check it out anyway. So, the background music is NOT very loud. This is a small place and it's fairly cosy, reminded me of Europe..It was very clean with pleasing decor and the staff are all friendly. There's a great selection of 'combos' as well as the roll menu and Sashimi. We tried the  Sashimi combo - and ALL of it was excellent! We also had the salmon Sashimi which was VERY good indeed. The Miso was good and the side salad was very fresh and tasty too. We tried the rainbow roll and the spicy salmon roll. Both were made with black rice and were excellent. Considering the quality of the fish, I'd say whilst it's not a cheap meal, it IS great value for money - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Newly opened for 3months Carefree Hwy & I17 At first glance it's a small strip mall style place but very nice decor. Less than 10 tables with a small sushi bar.  Super amazing fresh. No complaint at all Menu is completely over priced. $11 Philly roll, $7 salmon roll, $8 spicy tuna, $7 tuna nigiri Every new sushi place thinks they can charge Scottsdale prices.  Cucumber salad was large and big enough for 2 Average wait time for a few easy rolls Longer than average for the fried Cali 2 wait staff meant service was attentive with only 8 people here It's not a bad place but it's overpriced and underwhelming for the price.  It's new so they may not have settled in yet."}
{"text":"I am giving this spot a 4/5 because my good friend comes here once per week (she lives in the area) and the food and service is consistently good.   She and I decided to order take out that evening. We went with salmon, mackerel and butterfish sashimi (an order comes with 3 pieces each) and a few different roles. I liked how you could get brown rice rolls if you wanted. (For a small additional charge). The service was great and it didn't take them too long to put it together.   The sashimi was excellent! The rolls were coming apart a little but still yummy. A touch on the pricey side but given the quality I would say it was worth it...  Check it out if you are in the yonge and eglinton area and have a sushi craving!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a good sushi bar close to us.  I enjoyed the black rice.  very mild & good flavor. I ordered the echo lunch special and some of the nigiri sushi fish was too tough to cut with my chopsticks.  That is not normal, and I will try them again & hope that was just a fluke.  The flavors were good, as well as good service.  If the fish had been more tender, I would have given them 5 stars.  Hopefully, next time I will be able to do that."}
{"text":"I'm not a variety guy when it comes to sushi.  I am a bread-and-butter, give me huge quantities of salmon sushi/sashimi type of guy.  From this standpoint I was very satisfied with Echo.  Their fish was fresh, and the AYCE price was reasonable.  Prompt service, and a very tasty fried banana dessert that I've never encountered before at an AYCE sushi place.  Good job!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a 3.5 star because the service was slow and often servers would not bring all that we ordered and we had to ask for it several times before delivered. The set up is really small and tight and the lineup was out the door. We ended up sitting in front of the door and it was -5 outside. We were freezing every time the door opened thus not fully enjoying our meal. The food was good however. They need a bigger location and more staff and people who can keep up with what you've ordered. Also for $28/person is a bit steep to deal with all this."}
{"text":"I just finished dinner at Echo Sushi. Finally a halfway decent Sushi restaurant up here in the boondocks. The tempura was great. I had the hamachi Kama,@was delicious. Next time I will try the Sushi. They have a Japanese sushi chef. Smart move. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Not our first visit. Probably our sixth time there. We were a party of 6 including my wife, son, daughter-in-law and my 2 grandchildren.  Our entrees came out at different at different times. It service was terrible. I was finished with my food at least 10 minutes before my grandson received his meal. I complained but the waitress sad the kitchen was backed up. She was lying of thinking we were fools. People were seated after us and were eating before the last of our entrees showed up. The waitress never refilled drinks. I was so annoyed that I left a penny tip. The owner who makes all the sushi and the rolls was right there and never apologized or adjusted anything off the bill. It was not our first time at Echo Sushi but it is our last."}
{"text":"Other than fresh salmon sashimi and deep fried food (e.g. tempura and dumplings), the rest of the items on the menu were disappointing. Don't get makis. We ordered four makis (Spicy salmon, Avocado and salmon, Monster Roll and Red Dragon Roll) and they were ALL bad. Spicy salmon maki was not spicy; I couldn't tell if there was a sauce in it. It didn't have a lot of tempura; just a lot of rice. Spicy salmon sushi was better tasting than spicy salmon maki. Maybe the rest of the items containing rice were bad, because they used sushi rice that's not the best kind.   BBQ eel sushi tasted different from the typical BBQ eel sushi I had in other restaurants. The dipping sauce they gave us with tempura oysters tasted similar to A1 steak sauce. Tempura scallops and tempura oysters were pretty good. Plating was nice.   The service was quick and friendly. The server even remembered which ice cream each person ordered and placed each bowl in front of the right person. For an ayce sushi place, isn't that great service? They forgot a couple of items that we had checked off on the ordering sheet, though.     This restaurant did have a wide selection of sashimi, sushi, teppanyaki, teriyaki, udon, sushi pizza, salad, desserts and more, even beef sushi and vegetarian makis, but the only soup they offered on their ayce sushi dinner menu was miso soup.   $25.99 per person for ayce sushi dinner from Fridays to Sundays. I am not sure if there was parking available; you probably have to park on a street or in a municipal lot."}
{"text":"cute kimono outfits! and i LOVE this place! went here for the 1st time last night woth a friend and even though thw place was crowded, the service was speedy and they got all of our orders correct. the place is simply designed and well lit. i enjoyed everything that we ordered but my favourite was the cube beef with roasted garlic - so tasty and aromatic! the sashimi were so fresh and big! the food came out so fast! my experience here was very positive...i have nothing bad to say"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The sushi is amazing and they only use purple rice! The server told us their purple rice is healthier and less calories than traditional sticky rice. We tried their Las Vegas roll, eel roll, and the salmon surprise, all of them were great, but the salmon surprise was by far the best! The place is small, but it has a very intimate feel. They just recently opened, and I am so glad to have such a great sushi place nearby!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant so I was skeptical but I'm a big fan of eel so I had the Ultimate Dragon Roll and it was fantastic I was so happy I told the chef it was fantastic and I will be returning to this place on a regular weekly basis"}
{"text":"I am thrilled to have such an awesome sushi restaurant down the street!   The black rice is delicious.  Everything from sushi to poke bowls are delicious!  Portions are perfect!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here, we ordered the Bento box with Korean Beef.  It was very good, a lot of food.  We especially enjoyed the black rice.  Great service, we will be back to try the ramen."}
{"text":"I don't know how Echo sushi got the yelp rating it holds. This place is so unimpressive.   CONS:  No hostess or even welcoming staff  Terrible table service- hasty waitresses that quickly slap your order on the table and reach over your food for empty plates several times firing your meal  But worst of all- the sushi is just meh.   PROS  A large menu including some healthier alternatives like brown rice sushi with fruits (see pics)  Fast service, albeit unfriendly   The space is small but clean.   I RECOMMEND: looking for other places in the area. I prefer Ho Su Bistro up the street near Eglinton  EXTRA TIP: The beef teriyaki was very tasty and the spicy fried chicken wasn't bad, but order slowly because leftovers mean extra charges"}
{"text":"Great service and variety! Echo roll and brown rice rolls are must try! One of the best AYCE places in TO"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this sushi place given the rating. There's a lot of great competition in the area, so for a $30 ayce dinner, I expected more. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. The food lacked flavour and was just okay. The service was good, the food came out quickly. I've had much better sushi. I probably won't go back. There's great sushi in the area where you can order a lot for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I just moved to the area. Randomly had a craving for sushi and decided to treat myself. I saw Echo Sushi had the best reviews. I showed at 9:30. 30 Minutes to close and they hooked me up with the most delicious sushi and fried rice. When I got home and saw the rice was black I freaked until I tasted it. Best chicken fried rice of my life!! I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I went twice and both times I was extremely satisfied. They have a good selection of food and everything was fresh. Service was good (Great, said my friend who also works in the food industry!)... the only downside is no debit card and the place is kind of small, so make sure to arrive early if you're planning on eating dinner there."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 - solid quality sushi (not WOW), down sized portions, no edamame  Service 3/5 - didnt bring what I order some times, NO debit cards  Price 3/5 - $22 all you can eat  Will be back"}
{"text":"Very cheap place to go. There is no big variety on the menu, but the food is tasty. Small place."}
{"text":"The place was A-OK \"plus a little\" so I rounded up to four stars.   They have a diverse menu including sushi/sashimi, noodle/soup dishes (udon, yakisoba), Ramen (miso or spicy seafood), fried rice, poke bowls, and entrees like chicken katsu, Korean bulgogi, spicy pork, teriyakis (chicken or salmon).....   I tried the \"echo special\" for lunch - $11 includes: miso soup, salad, 6 pieces of sushi and 8 pieces of California roll (the latter has never been of interest to me but I was inclined to try it and I have to say that I actually enjoyed it.) The fish tasted fresh although that slice of snapper at first seemed a bit dry upon appearance. Overall, I really enjoyed the visit - service was nice however only one server at lunchtime so be prepared to wait a little if coming between noon and 1 pm or so. Overall, prices seem on the average-to-high-side but we'll explore that more later.    I liked the smaller size of this place (like maybe six or seven sushi bar seats and maybe eights table in all however it doesn't feel cramped.) The decor is clean and simple yet appealing.   The parking lot is a nightmare with which I been long familiar (Lake Pleasant nearby, people hauling toys, just busy overall and oftentimes lacking courtesy.)"}
{"text":"I feel this place is a bit over-rated and has good ratings because this area lacks good sushi. The AYCE menu offers mainly sushi rolls and maki, because of this we felt like a lof their dishes was packed with rice. We parted just a little bit of the rice out and the Manager came over and scolded us. I understand why she may be upset, but really no need to scold your customers. She tells us \"rice is the same price as sashimi\" and she will charge us for that. This was half way into our meals and we lost our appetite, so we just paid and left."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch based on former Yelp reviews.  Had the Echo Tower and the Carefree roll.  Both were excellent finished the meal with the green tea Mochi ice cream which is also wonderful.  Fantastic to have a good sushi place in the North Valley we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is a very small restaurant with only about 8 tables (22 seats total) and four chairs at the Sushi bar with nice atmosphere.   The quality of the food was top-notch.  I had Poke bowl - highly recommended.  Echo Tower - very delish.  Although the level of the service was not the best I could tell that the servers were trying their best and I expect it will improve in no time - after its \"growing pain\" subsides. I look forward to going back, and trying something new."}
{"text":"I had sushi and sushimi at many other restaurants, and never did I like them nearly as much as at Echo Sushi. Echo Sushi is this tiny Japanese restaurant just north of Davisville station; because it's so small, it's easy to get a waiter's or waitress's attention, which is especially beneficial when you have all-you-can-eat. I always take my friends to this place, and everyone loves it.  Recommended: plum wine."}
{"text":"Great spot for a nice dinner date! Everything was super fresh and tasty, their staff is amazing and really nice. We arrived early (around 6pm) and we got a table right away but by the time we left there was a pretty lineup (they do take reservations!!)   We had their ayce and paid around $80 (dinner for two and three beers). My bf and I always fill up on sushi really fast so I don't think we got our money's worth of food, next time we'll order from the menu."}
{"text":"Looking at the 4 stars with over 100 reviews, we had a positive outlook of this AYCE restaurant. It is a small store on a busy street that has decent decor and pretty decent washrooms. What let us down was the quality of the food!  The service was very good. One of the fastest and our waiter was on top of his game. He always made sure we had water, and took our orders, and all our food came at lightning speed.   Coming from Markham, sushi expectations are high and what was unfortunate was that a lot of the items were not up to par. Some notable items for me which are usually ultimate favourites of mine were the Green Dragon and Dynamite which were disappointing. I think it was perhaps there was too much rice and not enough filling. Some other items were just not tasty or weren't good compared to other places. For $24.99 I expected more from this AYCE sushi joint.   3/5. I would maybe come back for lunch if I was in the area, but I will not be visiting for dinner again."}
{"text":"We had driven past this place many times and FINALLY decided to stop and check it out. It was the best decision we ever made! The food was DELICIOUS. Best sushi we've had in a very long time. The staff was outstanding and very gracious. Food prep and presentation exceeded our expectations. We'll definitely be back and will refer this place to all our family and friends."}
{"text":"I waited for this restaurant to open so decided to try it for a TO GO lunch.  I do not eat sushi so ordered the Chicken Teriyaki.  It was terrible.  Their version of teriyaki is not good.  The chicken was so dry and it was not teriyaki.  I took a menu but threw it in the trash.  It was a waste of $10.  Need I say, I will never return."}
{"text":"Sushi and salmon rose over here is so delicious and fresh I love it and it is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Discovered this new spot with my girlfriend not too long ago.  Needless to say, we have been and will be going back for the foreseeable future.  Quick and fast service.  Food is great and fresh.  And best of all, they bring you everything you order and do not stuff the rolls with tempura batter as filler.  Amen."}
{"text":"I got the California roll and Salmon roll to go. They were good, but I felt like the rice overpowered what was inside of the rolls."}
