{"text":"I was craving sushi and happened to pass by i Bento.  This place is tiny and easily missed, however once I got inside I was glad I did as the prices looked reasonable.  The menu is small however there will definately be something for everyone.  I got one bento box which contained (Spicy Chicken, seaweed salad, tempura, california rolls, rice, and miso soup), and one maki special which came with california rolls and dumplings.  All the food was fresh particularly the california rolls, and the food was made quickly.  The girl running the counter and the lady working the kitchen were very friendly.  Overall, although the bento box was a little different then what I am used to, it hit the spot.  This is definately a take out spot."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly staff and the service was great.  I ordered spicy salmon roll and the salmon inside the roll was pretty fresh."}
{"text":"The service was quick and very friendly. The man greeted me once he saw me come in.  I ordered SB3 for about $9 (after tax). My first impression was the rolls looked small, but the entire meal was quite filling and tasty.  There's also a big pot of miso soup you can help yourself to. There are these little disposable bowls beside the big pot along with a cover. Thus you can take some to go if you're not dining in.  The man who was working there also gave me a free hand roll on the house. I think it was a crunchy salmon hand roll. It was very delicious. I think I would come back just for the hand rolls if I'm around the area.  Overall I think for the affordable price I got a very filling, delicious meal and the service was great. I recommend you check it out."}
