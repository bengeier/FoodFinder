{"text":"Great butcher shop.  High quality and great selection.  I wish they had more wild game.  Also, I find their bison a little pricey.  However, they have fantastic free range chicken and turkey.  Their beef and pork cuts look excellent, even if I don't buy them very often.  They also sell organic meat.  If you pre-order you can get a really good turkey from them for the holidays.

One of the things that make a butcher shop is the butchers themselves, and the butchers behind the counter here are very polite and seem quite knowledgeable and experienced.  The ladies behind the till are also quite easy to deal with.  I always leave here feeling like it was worth the stop."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey but you really do get what you pay for.  The customer service is excellent and the meat is phenomenal.  Sign up for the weekly flyer and Bruno points club to save a bit.  Great local joint!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Brunos off and on (don't live in the area) for close to 20 years!  I love their meats.  A little expensive... but worth it.  My favourite is the coffee/black pepper marinated pork tenderloin.  It is amazing BBQed!

I have also had the ham, beef tenderloin, sirloin steak, bacon, stuffed chicken breast(yummy), so I would disagree with the negative beef comment below.  I do agree that Costco beef is very good, but in my experience, the beef tenderloin here is tops.  

I have also had good experience the one time I had to call in for assistance.  They also sell bone marrow, and \"dog bones\" etc., if you are interested in that.

Their burgers are really tasty!  I do agree with the sausage comment... I bought a few different flavoured ones (raw ones that you cook yourself), and was a little disappointed in the (lack) of flavouring.... I was looking for more.  However, their pre-cooked sausages (roasted garlic, salsa etc) are very good.  

So, overall, I would recommend this highly.  Again, a little expensive, so don't go if you are bargain driven... but if you are looking for a nice cut - definitely don't pass it by.  

They also have a lot of frozen/prepared food entres - haven't tried those, but they look good."}
{"text":"This butcher is really a hit and miss experience.   Some products are good while others are mediocre to terrible.  

Turkey products are pretty good, pork are hit and miss, never bought chicken, beef products are terrible, and sausages are mediocre.  

I've tried their steaks several times and now given up.  Costco steaks are consistently better.  

Sausages have been a let down.  


As long as I'm marinating the meat myself, the end result is much better."}
{"text":"This update is based on their customer service over the phone.  

I called in to check on their pricing on sliced short ribs (like for Korean BBQ) and the response was, \"I don't know, you would have to come in.\"  Really, Bruno's?  So I asked, \"You don't know what you charge for a product?\" to which he replied, \"No, because I'm in the office.  You would have to ask the front.\"  

If it's too much effort for him to get his behind off the chair in the office to ask his own staff what the cost of a product is, I can't see why I should waste my time driving in to the store to find out.  My time is worth a lot more than that."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you only want to pick up one thing. I went in looking for head cheese, and came out with head cheese, liverwurst, two beef Wellingtons, some lebkuchen, some bread and a prime rib roast. And to this day, I still regret not getting more, it was all so good :("}
{"text":"My friend lives close by and was talking about this place so devotion check it out. There is a lot of parking space when you get there. I knew I wanted kabobs for the BBQ so went straight to the meat counter. The girl at the counter was friendly and answered my questions. They vacuum seal the meat in a container ( no brown butcher paper). I did not browse the store but noticed the had pre made meals for sale. The price was a little bit more than grocery store but the pieces of chicken were bigger and it tasted delicious (I bought the piri piri chicken kabob). It's not near my place but will return if I'm in the area. (Only four stars since I didn't try more products)."}
{"text":"Local butcher with tonnes of selection. I usually get Canadian bacon, sausages, hamburgers, seasoned skewers when they are on sale, and ready made salads and pizzas. They are expensive so I usually wait for sales which they do send e-mails if you sign up. The only thing I wish they had was pork belly, but they will do it if you ask in advance."}
{"text":"When I walked inside Bruno's Meat and Deli, all I think about is BBQ season is here!!

You can get your meat cut to your liking directly from the butcher or you can get their pre marinated chicken/tenderloin and just throw that on your grill... sizzling hot and delicious!

There are also their own house blend of cured meat, pate and prepared food (all you do is to heat that up).

It was so much fun browsing around. 

I want my MEAT!!"}
