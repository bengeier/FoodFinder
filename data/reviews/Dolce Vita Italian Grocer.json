{"text":"Excellent gelato at Dolce Vita.  I always enjoy coming over here, I often come over here after I go to Thai food corner to cool my palate off!"}
{"text":"This is real authentic Italian goodness. Run by an Italian, it couldn't get better. Gelato is handmade and most of their food is imported from Italy. I've lived in Naples and this place is good. Except the owner is from northern Italy and the food is different, still good. They always rotate their gelato flavors and we love their cheeses and meat platters! Just a little skimpy on the cheese and bread. Thumbs way up."}
{"text":"Very fresh pasta, great ravioli, good bruschetta, decent gelato, very fun, it was a bit of a splurge, but I will be back,"}
{"text":"The best gelato ever! They have a ton of delicious flavors, my favorite is their strattiatella."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite place in the city to be. When i need some delicious gelato and a fun atmosphere i always go to Dolce Vita. I bring every and talk to everyone about it .. i can't say enough good things. The staff are INCREDIBLE and of course the gelato is out of this world delicious .. i love love love LOVE this gelato shop. Goodbye ice cream, hello delicious gelato."}
{"text":"This is a little piece of small town Italy. The pasta is homemade with fresh cheeses and meats for appetizers. Authentic Italian food with great recommendations from owners Walter and Marty. We have brought friends on many occasions and Dolce Vita never disappoints. Also recommend finishing your meal with Walters amazing gelato."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. It has amazing gelato! Would recommend the chocolate and coconut. Interesting items in the grocery section. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This Italian grocer is as good as it gets! You step through their threshold and will find yourselves transported to La Bella Italia. Yes, you will find the smells and the food and the gelato just as you would disconver if you were in a small grocery store in Rome. The owner, Walter, is a wonderful friendly person, a delight to know. The cheeses and prosciutti and gelato and everything else he sells is top quality and delicious, and reasonably priced. We were so pleased to shop there, we will make the thirty-mile trip from our home often to cater to him.

Treat yourselves to the most exquisite gelato in Arizona. That's what we did. We really recommend this grocer."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Authentic Italian. Keep that in mind when talking to the owner. He is well, Italian! Had a very good and very fresh lunch sandwich one visit. On other visits the Gelato is amazinginginging..... Made in house..... Did I mention the Gelato is amazing??....... I like private owned restaurants. This one is not fancy but it is definitely a \"local feel\". Just what I wanted it to be."}
{"text":"Authentic italian food 100%. Pasta dishes and panini like only in Italy you will find, don't forget to step  in the gelateria  to finish your meal in the italian way: dolce , gelato o caffe?"}
{"text":"A STRONG RECOMMENDATION.  Just two weeks before my first time at Dolce Vita, I was swapping food photos with a BFF from back east.  I was showing her my tribute to a delicious, simple pasta dish her mother made for her growing up, and that she made for me when we lived together as roommates.  She was quick to point out that the dish was supposed to be made with Ditalini, not the Elbows I used.  I quickly defended that I couldn't seem to find Ditalini anywhere in Phoenix.

Enter Dolce Vita.  Not only is the gelato a sensual experience available in flavors to suit any taste, but there is a carefully chosen, fine selection of imported Italian pastas and Italian grocery items.  Many of the pastas are in hard to find shapes...including Ditalini (actually, Ditali, but they're only slightly bigger)!

When last there, I had the South African chocolate gelato.  It tasted as though the best chocolate mousse somehow found a way to morph into ice cold, refreshing gelato with a mouth-feel exponentially superior to even the best mousse.  

Before leaving I picked up a bag of the Abbracci variety (a half-chocolate, half vanilla, o-shaped biscuit/cookie for coffee) of Barilla's Mulino Bianco Biscuits, and they elevated this morning's coffee to levels only an Italian cookie/biscuit could.  If you try them, dunk them in your coffee.  They have an otherwise sandy texture.

I haven't tried any of the items from Dolce Vita's menu of prepared foods, but given my successes elsewhere in this store, I'm greatly looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Il gelato qua Ã¨ meraviglioso! Mille grazie!"}
{"text":"Gamely is out of this world!  So good!  And I'm Italian...and also love ice-cream,  errr gelato.  The servers were awesome and everything was out of this world great! Go here or be ashamed!"}
{"text":"The absolute best cup of cappuccino and the best service. The people are so friendly and the food is amazing! Authentic Italian food, but what do you expect, the owner is from Italy.  They also have the best gelato. I highly recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood shop for a handful of Italian items that you aren't going to find at your local grocery store. I stopped in to pick up an ingredient I couldn't pronounce (I showed a picture from my smartphone) and was quickly directed to it!"}
{"text":"Don't let the size of this place stop you from coming in. It is small and the grocery items and menu aren't extensive, but my sandwich and salad were delicious. The meat and cheese were sliced for my sandwich when I ordered. The owner Walter walked around talking to the tables while I was there. I'd love to come back and try the pasta."}
{"text":"Oh my word! The meats and cheeses at this place are amazing! You have to try the salami, best I've ever had! Not to mention the wide array of Italian products! They offer many items like pastas,  sauces, cookies, and specialty items. The next time I make a special dinner I plan to come here for supplies.  

In addition to the deli area you will find a small restaurant. We didn't eat there but it looks like a nice place for a weekend lunch.  It seems pretty laid back so it may be nice for kids too. 

Next door is a gelato store. Super yummy! I had a small cheescake gelato and shared it with my toddler,  it was just the right size since it was super rich. My husband got the salted carmel and son got the African dark chocolate.  They both loved it! 

Bottom line: check this place out for authentic Italian deli and gelato, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  The couple that owns this place come from Italy and they know how to do it right.  We not only love coming here for a little desert and a coffee but we just like to sit and talk to the owners because their accent is great.  They are so kind!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian meats and cheeses, bread that can only be made there (haven't found fresh Italian bread like that anywhere else), makes for the kind of sandwich I grew up on in an Italian family.  The gelato is also amazing.  My friend from Naples agrees too."}
{"text":"I accidentally posted this review under the Gelato Dolce Vita yelp, but it belongs here.

One of the true gems of the East Valley. Walter is a true character, and is very passionate about good food. I told him his food was amazing and he said \"No, Not amazing. Normal! People are just used to bad food.\" Seriously, just eat whatever he suggests. They have the real deal meats and cheeses. Guanciale, Bresaola, Finochiata, Gorgonzole Dolce, Pecorino Tuscano, Borchetto al Tartuffo! Great simple Sandwiches, amazing raviolis!

The list goes on and on. Here's a full review of one of my visits: http://forkvsfood.com/?p=126"}
{"text":"A friend took me here for gelato for the first time the other day. I've been looking for a good gelato place since I had my first gelato in Rome. This place is wonderful!! On a fluke, they had for the one night only my favorite flavor combination: Orange Chocolate. I could have bought a gallon of it. So delicious! Since then I've had their Red Velvet gelato and it is scrumptious. Their dulce de leche, Madagascar vanilla, and tiramisu flavors are yummy yummy in my tummy too. (Been back several times, in case you can't tell) My son is in love with their pistachio flavor.

The owners are wonderful and have a great sense of humor. I didn't realize I lived a 1/2 mile from them and I've been in the neighborhood for 5 years!

4 stars for now because I need to try their deli.... just another excuse to go in there and get some more gelato!"}
{"text":"Best gelato in Phoenix.  They also have a pretty good delicatessen and selection of Italian food.  I also really like their coffee."}
{"text":"In Northeast Mesa we find ourselves blessed once again. Dolce Vita Italian Grocer abounds with the unexpected!  Beyond the excellent selection of Italian groceries, deli meats and cheeses ....  Absolutely amazing meals are found here!  At $14 per entree we had the best (melt in your mouth) Gnocchi with Gorgonzola cream sauce I've ever tasted and Sausage Stuffed Ravioli with an incredible mouth watering red sauce.  We started with tomato caprese (best mozzarella I've tasted in a while). 

The only trouble ... you'll over eat! And when you think you've had too much you're going to want to head next-door for the multi year award winning gelato.  Wow!"}
{"text":"We went here for gelato recently. We didn't think they had a good selection and the gelato itself was so-so. We normally go to Frost but wanted to try something new. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We wanted Paninis. Had a craving. Went here and the Paninis were great! I ordered a basic mozzarella, basil, and tomato. Melissa ordered Prosciutto, mozzarella and tomato. Then we traded a half, so we each had a half of each. They make their own mozzarella and bread. They were delisioso. And only 7.00 per sandwich. Cheap great dinner. 
By the way, they also make their own gelato and cannoli. I just didn't have room for more. Definitely going back for desserts."}
{"text":"Gelato is top notch with tons of different homemade selections. The grocery store has things you can only find in a small Italian grocery store. The meat selection and cheese selection in the deli is second to none and their sandwiches are absolutely amazing. Definitely recommend the small hole in the wall place. You will not regret making a stop here."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in valley!!! Omg! Butternut squash ravioli to die for & the best cheeses & olives. Owners are so nice & they have these holiday sweets that are .... Heaven!!! Hayley is great & made a perfect ravioli for me! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Best gelato in the valley, hands down! Don't pass up the coconut or dark chocolate-simply divine!Sandwiches and pasta were tasty and affordable."}
{"text":"Great place, great service.  We are so pleased to have the gem come into the community as it is always a struggle to find a decent place for lunch that is not a chain or fast food.  We are now hooked and have had lunch here at least once a week the past 3 weeks and never dissapoints.  Portions are great. Pricing is great.  I don't know what else to say but you have to try it out."}
{"text":"I'm am so lucky I found this place. I was just in the areas looking for a place to stop while out and I happened upon this little gem. It's a store and deli. I had a daily special of pesto gnocchi, AMAZiNG! I cannot wait to bring my husband her next time we are on this side of town."}
{"text":"Was told by the owner and employees that the ravioli in their freezer were handmade and all homemade and stuffed there. All to find out it is all from Restaurant Depot.  All they do is box it and put their own sticker on it. They are a FRAUD!!!! Never going there AGAIN!!  I am Embarrassed for them that they think they can get away with that and that other people in the restaurant world wouldn't be able to tell by the shape, cut, and consistency is isn't hand or homemade.  Such a Shame."}
{"text":"First time visiting Dolce Vita yesterday and I was impressed. Purchased a variety of specialty meats, cheese and olive oil. Gelato was amazing. Owner was friendly and very nice. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Not only do they have a great selection of non gmo Italian dry goods but the meats and cheeses are delectable treats. They also whip up quick tasty Italian meals. Order a panino with sopressata meat called the \"Parris Special\" it is probably the best one you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"There isn't a place in the valley where you can find quality cured meats from Europe....until now! From Guanciale to Prosciutto Crudo it's all devine. My personal favorites are the Porchetta and Speck! If your looking for DOP cheeses this is the place Peccorino, Parmigiana reggiano etc.
I didn't try the pasta or sandwiches but I will be in the future. The owner was very helpful with choosing a variety of different meats and cheeses and let me sample everything. So folks the bottom line is if you want a place for quality imported meats and cheeses for your next wine party don't go to whole foods come here!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for Gelatos thy have many different awesome flavors. The real taste of Italy is here. The best in Arizona."}
{"text":"Each bite of their sandwiches taste like Italy!  Friend and I came for lunch and it's never busy but ought to be!  Every aspect of the sandwiches is special - amazing Italian bread, fine cheeses, artisan cured meats, olive oil, olive tapenade, etc.  They sell the cheese and cured meats by the pound as well.  As we slowly savored every bite, we did agree our husbands would complain there is not enough substance for their larger appetites.  They do not put more than 2 slices of meat between the bread but it was enough for me because the cured meat flavors are much more robust than your typical deli meat.  Being a grocer, there was only a few sandwiches, and 2-4 pasta and salad dishes.  Selection limited but quality present.  When finished, hop next door to their homemade gelato goodness!"}
{"text":"We are from San Francisco and have been in search of an excellent eatery. Dolce Vita is just as good as the best in San Francisco. The food is authentic and made with only the very best, freshest ingredients. Paninis, pasta, cheese and meat plates...all are outstanding! You HAVE TO COME HERE and see for yourself. We bring a bottle of wine and order dinner and even if we are full, we get gelato afterwards. Again, the very best quality you could ever want."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and authentic.  The food is unforgettable.  You will be thinking about it for days.  They were featured in the New Times.  Look up the article and eat everything it says!  The only one I can remember is the cheese plate \"Piatte fromaggia\" ... it was phenominal.  BTW it is byo Wine!  So you can save money bringing your favorite beverage!"}
{"text":"I don't see how anyone could find any fault with this place. Try their bread if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. Went with the Yelp deal and the food was outstanding.  Cute quaint little restaurant.  They import their meats from Italy so that should tell you right there they have a passion for quality. 

They make many different homemade gelatos that are by far the best I have had in the USA.

Love the authentic feel they all speak Italian random to each other and it is a plus.

Would definitely return.  I am stingy with 5 star reviews so this says something about this place.

Trust me it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Amazing. It is exactly Italian gelato. Nothing compares that I have ever eaten stateside!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in just to have a look. However since they had chocolate AND lemon, actually limoncello - but close enough, I decided to get a double scoop of gelato.  Over on the deli side...they had Bresaola!!!  So happy. The usual suspects too - prosciutto, mortadella, pastas, etc.   holy cow, they have anise oil!  Now that is really not common.  I have a feeling this store is gonna be on my regular grocery route. 

Great service, great deli and great gelato. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best gelato ever. Period. I have eaten a lot of the flavors and they are all excellent.  Do yourself a favor and run here for a party in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and lucky for me, we are staying with friends who live right by it. My husband had the Dolce Vita panino and my daughter and I shared a Parma but added basil. In addition, we had a creamy tortellini with ham that was Amazing. They were even nice enough to split it and portion it on separate plates for us. The staff is super attentive and friendly as well. The gelato....cue angels singing in a chorus... I had tiramisu and my husband had forest berries. Divine. The only negative is that the sandwiches are a little small for the price but the flavor makes it worth it.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Wonderful couple that own this establishment and are always so helpful. I had antipasto trays made for a party and what a success! The meats and cheeses were fabulous !  Not only a great deli but a great little restaurant too."}
{"text":"Really this place is kind of average as far as Italian groceries or salumeria are concerned.  Previously frozen food and poor service make this place very sub-par.  I wish there were more of these out here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for gelato - and WOW! So many choices - all delicious! Great little spot - feels like Italy!"}
{"text":"Best place for a frozen treat, so don't pass it up for the conventional. Marty and Walter are magicians when it comes to gelato. Do yourselves a favor and spare your mouth the coldstone craving by improving your tastebuds standards."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian, you'll love this place.  If you're looking for a suggestion, try the homemade gelato, spicy salami, pastries, paninis, baguette, cookies, do I need to go on?..."}
{"text":"First.  The Gelato is amazing.  It is the best in the East Valley.  

This review is about the deli.  Having had the fortune of living in San Diego for 20+ years and having Little Italy across the bridge from me I am deli spoiled.  I and used to fresh pasta to purchase, tons of cheeses, meats, fresh pizza dough as well as all the dried pasta you can imagine and everything in between that is  yummy Italian to eat.  This place has the \"basics\" of a deli.  The floor space is mostly open and the shelves are stocked just barely. I went in today for 00 ground flour and they had one bag.  Really?  One bag?  So anyway, in Mesa, this is as good as it gets.  But if you are from any big city that has real Italian delis, like Chicago, New York, San Diego, LA, San Francisco, prepare to be monumentally disappointed."}
{"text":"The BEST gelato that I've had. I love visiting this place and it can explain its continuity by the passion that the owners bring to the table."}
{"text":"I wasn't aware that this place was a restaurant as well but after having the food and the gelato I can say that this is the best Italian food I have had.

The staff is very nice and real Italians as well that adds to the atmosphere. I would highly recomend this to anyone with taste buds that want a new taste.

P.s. the price is very resonable; about $8 - $12 per person!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim. Located in a shopping center that is half deserted, but this did not disappoint. Don't be deceived by the location. Absolutely delicious authentic gelato! A bit pricey but worth it. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. We go for gelato once a week. They have fantastic dairy free desserts like lemon, grapefruit, and other fruit flavored gelato. You can also get fantastic authentic imported Italian meats, cheeses, pasta and sauces. Buonissimo!"}
{"text":"3.75 stars!

First time visiting Dolce Vita Gelato, although I've tried its gelati at Peixoto (2015 review) and at Paris Rendez-Vous (2016 review).  I came today hoping I could get something to eat at the Italian market connected next to it, and then get some gelato and coffee to finish the meal, but no one was tending to the cheese and deli cases, so a snack will have to do.

Was able to sample four flavors- \"Stupify,\" DVG's Gold medal winner at Gelato Festival 2017 America; South African Dark Chocolate; Bourbon Vanilla (spied owner Walter incorporating it in a float!); and Mango; and went with Stupify and the dark chocolate in a medium cup ($4.29), plus a cup of Americano ($2.09).  \"Stupify\" features \"spiced cookie, nutmeg, and cinnamon\" flavors and comes with a whole spiced cookie, but I had not noticed it in time for photo-capturing until it was too late!  It had caramel ribbons on top, as well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the South African Dark Chocolate!  Ever-so-slightly sweetened rich chocolate, and just enough bitterness-- dark chocolate lovers who enjoy 70% or higher will appreciate this!  The cup of Americano helped to keep the sweet flavors from overwhelming my tastebuds.

Will definitely return to try more flavors.  Now off to burn calories- my body is buzzing from the sugar and caffeine!"}
{"text":"Why did it take me so long to try this place out?!? It's so delicious! My husband and I both had the \"stupify\" in waffle cones and we just couldn't get enough! Do yourself a favor and go here ASAP!! I can't wait to try their sandwiches next!"}
{"text":"Wanting to try something different I talked my wife into dinner here. I wanted to shop more than eat but a meal sounded good.
     We looked at the sandwiches, which were appetizing but I knew my wife wanted pasta. We asked and they showed us their pasta menu. Being a small store I knew it would be limited. We choose a pasta with a sausage sauce.
     I'll be honest and say it came close in flavor to what I've had in Italy and other real Italian spots in Europe. It was a nice sauce but far from a sausage sauce. I asked and was told that the sausage was ground up in it. The only thing I could see was small pieces of Parmesan that we put on. It was more like a plain Bolognese sauce without any meat. The pasta was nice though under cooked as evidenced by being harder and dry on the inside when we ate it. It wasn't bad, but I think they should have tried the pasta before plating it and not rushed it to us. I should have sent it back but my wife didn't want to. I'm sure she would have felt embarrassed for them and it was good enough to eat. The price was $11.00 which I felt was high for what we got and the environment we were in. I could see it at a real sit-down place, but this is more deli than anything else. A side salad was extra and priced higher that it was worth also.
     After our meal I picked out 2 things from the meats and cheese cases. They have a nice selection and those prices aren't to bad considering what you get. Both were Italian but neither were made in Italy, Sausage and cheese.
     My wife had a little Gelato and to be honest, it was far better then any I've had in Italy or Europe. Much more flavor and a better price.
      
     My final view:  Have a sandwich, take some cheese home, enjoy the Gelato and look through the grocery items. There are some very interesting things I'll bring home on my next visit."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find!  I was in the area the other day and decided to give this place a shot.  This is the real deal.  A very proud Italian owner who insists on delivering the best quality and flavor in everything he does.  We had stopped for a sandwich, but ended up with meats, cheeses, and breads on our way out.  All of which is delicious!  Oh yeah!  The sandwich I ordered for lunch?  Awesome!  If you're looking for authentic Italian food and not Olive Garden or Portillo's chain food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't done a review for the grocer side of the business. 

I have been a frequent customer here for the last 2 years. The food is fantastic!  It seems like I'm getting a panini almost once a week. Everything is great from the bread, the cheese, and the meats. Extremely authentic and high quality products are used. Plus the service always comes with a smile!

Great hole in the wall grocer/cafe."}
{"text":"It is not recommended you go here between lunch and dinner, as I stopped in at about 3:30 pm to grab something to go and when I asked to see the menu I was told by the owner not to order anything hot and all cold items would take a min of 20 minutes because his wait staff had not come in yet because it was not dinner time.  So the owner waited on the people who were buying items and I ordered the Eggplant panni and waited and waited.  Then his wife came back from grocery shopping and he was able to make my sandwich.  I thought it was odd he only wore one glove but touched my sandwich with both hands. My dad loves eggplant and has had eggplant parm and eggplant sandwiches from most of the Italian restaurants and delis in town.  This sandwich was rated low.  My dad said it was just okay, very dry and needed some gravy.  (we call pasta sauce gravy).  We will come back to try the ravioli and other hot items, the menu is very limited but it will be nice to try some hot made home made Italian food during dinner time. So right now I give it 2 stars because the food was just ok and their was absolutely no customer service, it was as though I was bothering them, but will update when I return.  The grocery store had a very limited supply of items and I had hoped they had some home made pastries or something for Easter but no luck.  They did say they had fresh from Italy just flown in overnight mozzarella cheese. 4oz for $12.00.  They also have Cannoli shells and sell 3 pound tubs of ricotta cheese for the Cannoli filing. They do have music on Friday nights, not afternoon but nights."}
{"text":"We stopped by to try the cannolis, but we ended up having lunch here.  It was kind of a weird time for lunch so the place wasn't super crowded.  There was a group of diners who were kind of hanging out and speaking Italian with the owner.  That seemed like a good sign.  My husband tried the lobster ravioli, and I had one of their sandwiches.  Both were quite good.  The lobster ravioli was adequately stuffed, and the pasta was very fresh.  The mozzarella was definitely the star of my sandwich.  It was incredibly fresh and refreshing.  We were incredibly stuffed, but we wanted to try the gelato.  I had the salted caramel, and it was very creamy.  I think I would prefer Grateful Spoon if I was in the mood for gelato, but we will probably come back to try other food items.  The cannoli, sadly, remains untouched since we are still pretty stuffed from our lunch.  It looks yummy, though. :)"}
{"text":"I love love love coming here for a quick gelato treat. Every flavor is amazing, and I always have the hardest time deciding between flavors. Pistachio is an absolute favorite for me and my friends. I've also had the hazelnut and their award-winning flavor, the autumn dream (I think that's what it's called) - both heavenly. The store is a very cute family-owned Italian shop that sells many speciality items and foods. I haven't gotten the chance to try anything but the gelato, but I definitely can't wait to go back and explore everything else the store has to offer. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service is the best, ice cream is the best and all the favors are good. I found this place on yelp and since then I have came back 3 or 4 times a month . All my friends I bring fall in love."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and salad. Strawberry gelato to finish dinner was perfect.  Service was friendly, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've lived just down the street from them for 10 years, and somehow we never \"discovered\" them ( we thought it was just a gelato shop. I stopped in one day to look - think I came off as rude, as I was staring around open-mouthed at the amazing grocery items, and didn't even say hello until i made it to the counter.
   I picked up a couple of small packages of mortadella and spicy sopressata and some provolone and Parmesan to try to encourage my family to eat salads - and for a couple of days (as long as I still had meat left) - that's all they wanted.
   I went back in with my son-in-law got the Calabrese, and I saw a man there eating pasta that looked wonderful - and asked for the same. I'm not sure what it was called, but it was a revelation! Creamy white sauce with just a hint of lemon peel- can't even describe how good it was.
   I would absolutely LOVE it if the owners offered small cooking workshops for those of us that would like to learn how to properly USE all those wonderful products they carry ( and of course we'd need to buy our specialty items there). And I have no illusions I'll ever cook NEARLY as well as this wonderful family gem- so they wouldn't lose a customer. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat in beautiful Arizona! The food is outstanding and fresh. Walter and Marti are the best.

Sandwiches are unique and full of flavor.

Pasta is delicious and sauces are fresh.

Gelato flavored are vast and taste amazing.

I frequent this place weekly and love the atmosphere. It's as if you are transported to a different place, a more enjoyable place."}
{"text":"I ordered an insalatina (side of greens), tagliere (assorted meats and cheeses, with olives served as a platter), and a calabrese panino.  The service was very slow (but that may be because they were cleaning up after a very large party), and the ingredients were not all \"fresh.\"  The lettuce was made from tubs that look like they came from Costco and was not cleaned before use.  The dressing (vinegar and oil) also included a Balsamic dressing which I did not ask for (but I enjoyed).  It looked like there was someone in training making my food because the owners (they spoke Italian) were telling the employee how to make my food and helping with the dishes.  The sandwich was delicious, but nothing real special. The tailgate was all packed in the same plastic to-go container, which did not make it all home in one piece. All the elements in the dish slid into each other and into the various cheeses and sides that came with it.  I have been to the Gelato side of the deli, and I had no problems there.  I will try the deli again; I am hoping they were having a bad day."}
{"text":"This place has the best gelato the staff and extremely nice  and helpful and helping me choose my order when I had my tonsils removed this was the only this that I could eat and it was amazing so happy to have found this place and it's in the perfect little location. Its also awesome to have like a little Italian market on the other side of the shop and get cool gifts and food."}
{"text":"Dolce Vita's gelato is the best in town and their paninis and other foods are to die for. The owners Walter and Marty are quite charming and entertaining. My favorite gelato flavors are the blood orange and the mocchacino. These are  very hardworking people who sole mission is to delight you. The store also sells pasta and many other imported Italian foods. Check it out !!"}
{"text":"I found this place last year. I have a family with many allergies and picky about great taste too.  The gelato is the best I've ever found. Made on site by hand, allergen lists up and all marked which really helped. Wonderful taste. The little grocery side had beautiful cheeses and meats and real Italian pastas.  Even a great selection of gluten free pasta. The gnocchi is to die for."}
{"text":"Such a cute, unique little place!! Their gelato is AMAZING (pistachio! ) and their sandwiches are really good! Check them out!"}
