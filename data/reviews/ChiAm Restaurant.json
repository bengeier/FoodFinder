{"text":"The foods are really nice. The place is cery clean and modern. Would recommend thus food to anyone and any age. Good jo Chiam!"}
{"text":"Although located across from CSN, a potentially great location for a fast-food type restaurant, I can see why this restaurant is not busier.  While the food is made-to-order and it is good, it is a little pricey.  $1.88 per dumpling-- which are bite-sized-- is too much when you can get top-grade dim-sum for a lower price at any Chinese restaurant that serves the same.  We ordered Mongolian beef, and the beef itself was tender and flavorful, but there was hardly any beef at all in this dish-- it was overrun by onions and peppers. While I appreciated that Chiam offered organic and gluten-free specialties, I thought that the cost was too steep for the value.  Sadly, my companions and I decided that it was not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Food was really good, I would come back again if I lived in Las Vegas. I bit on the expense side for the amount of food given."}
{"text":"Its really a good dim sum the best love all of it .Service is good nice people and love the decorations."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place includes \"dim sum\" in their name. The only traditional dim sum item they offer is siu mai, and they charge $1.28 per individual piece. Their other offerings are the same standard fare you'd find at an average Chinese buffet. The setup is the same as Panda Express: choose noodles or rice and two entrees. But the food here is inferior to Panda Express (and I'm not a big fan of Panda Express). And to top it off, two meals without drinks was $28!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try ChiAm again and see if they had any organic options like their sign and advertisements say that they have.  Nope, still nothing organic.  Also, a weekday just before noon, and no customers and no beef.  I guess I know why no customers on both my visits."}
{"text":"The shrimp ball was cold on the outside and almost frozen on the inside. I had the Pork dimsum and it tasted and smelled like fish, but it was pork meat. The items are very expensive for things that are not prepared fresh and looked old sitting on the steam table. $13.50 for a 2 item plate on a steam table- No way."}
{"text":"The staff was awesome! Clean and made to order fresh food!. I would come back just for the staff! The dim sum is awesome!"}
{"text":"This was one of the biggest waste of money and time I've ever done.  Flavorless food. Awful service and time. Size wise. Tiny tiny tiny all it is is jus another Chinese food place with a couple of appetizers. Don't waste you time."}
{"text":"Unbelievably disappointing. My first thought is: why have \"dim sum\" in the name when the offering is so scant? Serving 4 different kinds of shumai hardly qualifies. I LOVE dim sum so I was excited when I heard a place opened nearby my home, so you must understand my disappointment. 
This is a Panda Express knock-off! Their sales pitch of serving supposed organic food may be the only thing going for them. For me, considering all things equal, go to Panda Express because they're their meals are better priced (I can't believe I just said that). Lucky for you, you still have a choice. I, on the other hand, was not so fortunate. My daughter and I were hungry so we settled. 

The cafe is clean, tastefully decorated, plays upbeat music, and pleasant staff hence the extra star. 

If I'm to describe my overall experience with 3 words, it's: \"not ever returning.\""}
{"text":"Amazing vegetable spring rolls, delicious tiger shrimp, great service! Highly recommend :)

All their shrimp products are very fresh, especially shrimp shu mai!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant twice with to-go orders. The only complaints I have are the side item was wrong on one out of the 4 meals we purchased and my husband felt his beef was overly spiced. That being said, the chicken has been consistently delicious and the fried rice is the best fried rice I've had from a restaurant. The restaurant is immaculately clean and I love the coca cola freestyle. All of the food we have received took approximately a 20+ minute wait but no complaints here as it was all fresh and totally worth it."}
{"text":"Opens at 10am, we arrived at 11:10.  Girl working the cash register was very helpful explaining how to order and our choices.  However nothing on the organic side was available.  Ordered the orange chicken and walnut shrimp, wife ordered beef and broccoli and also teriyaki chicken.  We also ordered the shrimp balls and some dim sum, everything to go.  WE FINALLY GOT OUR FOOD AT 11:55!!!!  I suspect that we may have been the first customers of the day, but if you open at 10 and have an hour of prep, we should have gotten our food faster.  They also forgot our dim sum order.  The only reason I added a star, was because the food was pretty good and obviously freshly made.  But the wait, half the menu unavailable, price, and order mess up...we won't be back."}
{"text":"Food has no MSG, I'll pay a bit more for that. Most if not all chinese restaurant uses MSG. The place is so clean and design good. I wish you guys goodluck."}
{"text":"Really clean restaurant. Staff is so friendly and helpful. Food is made to order and fresh. I recommend the Florida orange chicken and trying some dim sum. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Really fresh food. Great Vegetarian and Vegan options at a super reasonable price. Friendly staff. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I tried the Chiam at the boulevard mall. It was the most disgusting disappointment dim sum place I have ever been . I ordered the dynasty Mongolian beef and pork bun. The beef was basically ground beef the only time beef should be ground in a asian dish is almost never come to think of it I can only think of one dish that is dry cooked string beans with ground pork (Thai dish) . the vegetables were barely present their was no flavor at all . it looked like chili on top of white rice.. Wendy's chili taste better than that dog food.. And the pork bun wasn't bad but for $3 the portion was sorry . And the pricing is waaay to much they charge for each piece of dim sum lol like come I'm not that picky when it comes to food . By far worst place I've ate in Vegas get some authentic dim sum at \"Orchids Garden\". This place has never failed me . To everyone that gave this place more than 1* has never had authentic dim sum .. I honestly would rather eat McDonald's."}
{"text":"A very Panda-esque restaurant. They claim to serve organic options here. So hopefully it is a lot healthier.  Food is better tasting than panda and tastes more fresh.  Nice presentation upon ordering. Friendly service. Only reason it gets a four stars instead of five is because it's very expensive here. Two, two side order plates, one dim sum, and one large drink cost $32 and change. Will be back. But next I will split a three side order plate with who ever I come with or hold off for a coupon."}
{"text":"Horrible service, no selection 2 hours before they close.  Especially if you want Dim Sum.  Inflexible if you want to substitute items.  But the Thai Bistro restaurant across the parking lot is great and the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Pros: This place offers dim sum and doesn't use MSG. 

Cons: The prices are expensive, especially since it's an a la carte, order and seat yourself type of place. 

Probably won't go again, even though I'm allergic to MSG and love dim sum."}
{"text":"Nice staff, we were told 10 min thougha nd I'm still waiting half hr later. May update after I eat food but thought I woulda t least checki n...."}
{"text":"Good food...however I would like to have seen a larger selection of dim sum. I had the Sui Mai (which was very good) and Kung pao chicken. Right now they only offer Sui Mai and shrimp balls. The chef said they will be offering more dim sum soon. Otherwise everything was good."}
{"text":"Wonderful place and really good food .
Coming back to this place for sure .
Place is really clean and the personnel is very friendly .
A keeper !"}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I have ever tasted. We ordered two traditional chef platter because they did not have organic at the time. The server was helpful, she spent time informing me what they don't have. They were out of beef and walnuts for the walnut shrimp (it was Noon). So we ordered Garlic Prawns, Mandarin Port, Emperor Chicken & Mushrooms, Long Life Noodles, and King Fried Rice. Don't let the fancy names fool you. The Emperor Chicken is simply boiled gray dark meat with button mushrooms in a off white water. Long Life Noodles was a greasy pile of brown noodles with a few strands of scallions and cabbage. The fried rice was dry and had a few frozen carrots and peas. There were three small pieces of shrimp and three sprigs of broccoli. You can get much better quality and price at Panda Express and that's not saying much. We were the only patrons at the time and it took the cook over 15 minutes to prepare the food. The two traditional platter and two medium drinks cost $26. Their dim sum selection is a joke. They only serve dumplings and each bite size dumpling is $1.68 a piece. I used a Groupon ($12 for $20) discount and it's still not worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great ambience, friendly staff. The food is authentic and the portion is generous! I highly recommend everybody to come experience and you'll agree with me!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"The food and prices seemed reasonable. The food tasted good and without an overly greasey feeling that I've  come to expect from places like this. The decor is very clean and pleasant with lots of red and pretty umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. Overral I  feel like it was a good meal and a friendly place."}
{"text":"My family went here because we had yet to find a good asian restaurant in town. It was so good, we are looking forward to going back. The only thing I'd change is to have larger portion sizes because everything we had was so good. We ordered noodles, florida orange chicken, white rice and spring rolls. They have one of those awesome soda machines that allow you to have almost any drink you'd like which is a big plus! The cashier was nice enough to put the basketball game on the tv for us and the place was super clean :)"}
{"text":"How have I never been here? MY NEW GO-TO! A Chinese American (get it? chi-am?!) spot with organic & vegetarian options... AND no msg! Everything was so fresh & made to order; might have costed a tad more than typical dim sum places, but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! Quality over quantity, clearly. After eating Asian foods -- my skin feels oily, my stomach is in on/off knots & I feel sluggish. Not at ALL after this place! And I definitely indulged out of excitement! 

FOR HER: I ordered the TIGER WALNUT SHRIMP, which had surprisingly large battered shrimp in a creamy mayo sauce topped with candied walnuts. Paired with WHITE RICE & LONG LIFE NOODLES. I also tried the JUMBO SHRIMP SIU MAI (fave!), JUMBO SHRIMP DUMPLING, and SHRIMP & PARSLEY DUMPLINGS. All served hot and fresh, so delicious... ordered 3 of each! 

FOR HIM: He ordered the BEEF & BROCCOLI with WHITE RICE. As a Chinese food fanatic, he was very impressed! Very flavorful, fresh steamed broccoli (I don't even like broccoli and I liked it!),  and extremely satisfying! He also was impressed with the dim sum as he could not get over how it was not coated in oil like we're used to at other places! 

They also have some very cool promotions going on while we were there. They had good priced catering options with free delivery, a Spring Value Box special (entree & side for only $4.88!) and the cutest Chinese dress accessory for wine bottles given with any $20.00 purchase! Oh, and check in on YELP & you get 20% off your next visit! 

Also have to add this is probably one of the cleanest places I've ever eaten at. Even the bathrooms! The decor is very cute & modern as well (especially the ceiling!)... and the customer service was amazing from start to finish. Devonne & Chung the cook were so nice! I feel like I can go on and on about this place honestly! My only qualm was that I got too full to try more of their dim sum selection -- which I will definitely be back to try! :)"}
{"text":"WOW, THIS PLACE BOMB! All of their food is made fresh, full of flavor... AND has vegetarian & organic options! I enjoyed the dim sum but the beef and broccoli was my fave! Try the shrimp siu mai too! The prices might be more than usual dim sum places, but you get what you pay for... PURE QUALITY! Not oily and doesn't make you feel crappy after like other places usually do. I WILL DEF BE BACK SOON! :D"}
{"text":"Free WiFi,  quiet,  inexpensive Chinese American grub.  Very affordable price. They advertise a side and entree for under $5."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I noticed how clean the restaurant is. The staff on duty greeted me nicely and informed me that it was going to be cooked to order.  I was doubtful at first but gave it a try anyway. The food came out great! I ordered the chef platter, with noodles, orange chicken and beef broccoli. I can say it was really worth the wait! I cannot wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"A great little place when you're in the mood for dim sum and you don't want to drive all the way by china town and see the crazy traffic. I tried the fried rice and orange chicken with some shrimp dum sum on the side. It was really tasty. Orange chicken was nice and crunchy while the noodles wasn't salty and was really good. The dim sum was made fresh so it was super good! Going to try other items in the menu soon!"}
{"text":"i love the atmosphere there,everyone is nice and friendly and the food quality is amazing.i really recommend the orange chicken and the pork and shrimp sui mai!!"}
{"text":"This place is really clean, it's a nice enviornment,  staff is nice and I like that it's not far from where I live. I'm not an expert on Dim Sum but I enjoyed my meal. My boyfriend and I got a mix and match tray of 10 pieces for 12 bucks and some life long noodles. We both enjoyed it very much. Great place to pick up and go!"}
{"text":"Love the place!!! So great to be able to get Dim Sum quick!!! Food is amazing and they have the super cool coke machine that has a million combos!"}
{"text":"Really nice clean establishment with a friendly staff! They serve organic which is why the prices are on the high side. I was craving dim sum and was let down at how small of a selection they had. I was impressed at how nice staff was. The Pacific Shrimp Roll was perfect, tasted great!"}
{"text":"As we pulled in to our parking spot, we saw one of the ChiAm cooks walk out of Great Links a couple doors down with some food. Not a good sign if the cooks won't eat the food at their own restaurant. My wife and I bought the Groupon, and sampled a few things from the menu. We shared a shrimp ball, which was huge but lacked seasoning. We tried a couple pieces of the dim sum, which were tasty but falling apart. We also tried a platter with the noodles, orange chicken, and walnut shrimp. The walnut shrimp was a highlight of the meal, crispy and flavorful. But the orange chicken lacked flavor, and the noodles had way too much onion. There was more onion than actual noodles. We probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"great dumplings and shiu mai  at least close to SF china town's dimsum
bathrooms are clean and very clean"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Sui mai does not a dim sum restaurant make.

Lured in my the words \"dim sum\" on the exterior building, I knew I was in trouble when I walked in to the cafeteria-style setup. I looked at the menu, and the only thing in the dim sum category is sui mai (four types). The sides/apps section included a Pacific Shrimp Ball. 

Majority of offerings are premade, sitting-under-a-heat-lamp, exposed-to-the-air offerings you can find at any Chinese fast-food joint. They claim to use higher-quality, organic ingredients but if you're going to serve it this way, it doesn't matter. At 7PM there were no customers, so the freshness of the food was questionable. 

The items I sampled were average if not slightly below. Sui mai were huge, golf-ball-sized items, which helped to justify the ~$1.30 charge per piece. Shrimp items were fresh, juicy, and nicely shrimpy. Pork and chicken(?) sui mai did not stand out. I'm not fully convinced these aren't out of a freezer and just freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Finally managed to try this place but we were disappointed. The two stars are for the cleanliness and the friendly staff. The food ranged from \"okay\" to sad. A dim sum restaurant with only one dim sum, available in four different meats. They were out of beef, pork and shrimp were boring, and the chicken was disgusting. They're large, at least. I thought the long-life noodles were okay, but hubby's entrees were boring, tough & chewy. It doesn't matter how organic it is if it's badly cooked or kept out in warming trays for too long. I might return for noodles some day, but nothing else.

Post visit note: NOW they've added more Dim Sum, I'm sure I'll want to try them because I love dim sum but I'm sure it'll be quite a while before I do. I need my memory of this visit to dim more."}
{"text":"As we walked in, we were told they were out of pork and beef. Not a great start to our visit. Then we got the sticker shock- a plate with two entrees and a large side (similar to what you'd get at Panda Express) will run you $13 without a drink. Was the quality worth it? Debatable.

Pacific Garlic Prawns: they're shrimp not prawns, good flavors, but sauce was thin and watery 
Mandarin Chicken: BF said texture was rubbery, I found the sauce too sweet
Broccoli & Beef: Guess it was the last of their beef?, average
Teriyaki chicken: better than expected
Sides: fried rice and long life noodles were okay,  less greasy than similar spots. 
Dim sum: shrimp ball was bland, parsley-shrimp dumpling tasted good but the skin stuck to the serving dish and fell apart.
Drinks: They have smoothies for $7 with additional chia seed, protein, etc for +$1 add-on. Strawberry-peach flavor recommended by the cashier was refreshing. Fountain beverages use the Coke Freestyle machine.

Service was polite, but extremely slow. Despite the cafeteria-style setup, food is made to order, which is good but takes longer than expected for this type of restaurant. My noodles came out after my guy was completely done eating his meal.

TIPS: Join their mailing list for various offers. They currently offer 20% off coupons for your next visit if you check in on Yelp."}
{"text":"We don't say this about food often but this was awful, their dim sum was really poor. We tried all of them and honestly they resembled something that washed up on the beach. Not to mention each of them stuck badly to the paper plate that they were served on. We found ourselves having to choke down the pieces and immediately needing something to chase down the taste.

Their fried rice and teriyaki wasn't bad but the chicken seemed boiled and the flavored were just \"eh\". 

We won't be going back"}
{"text":"This place offers delicious, high quality food. The prices are a bit expensive Much of it is organic"}
{"text":"This is a new, contemporary Asian eatery tucked away in the corner of the Lowes shopping plaza, between Starbucks and Great Links.  Cute, fresh decor,. They've only been open 5 weeks and probably need to work out a few things. I was expecting a good variety of dim sum, since that's what their sign indicated, but there was only 4 type of siu mai--shrimp, pork, beef, and chicken, plus pacific shrimp ball. There were also standard Chinese entrees in steam trays. We ordered all varieties of the siu mai $1.98 each with hot oil and mustard sauces and the hot sour soup. (The cashier was helpful and friendly and gave us a 10% discount.)  These were generously sized dumplings, okay flavor.  The soup could be a bit more savory.    I really want them to succeed because it would be nice to have a good dim sum place nearby, so I hope they change up their menu to differentiate from other Chinese food places by maybe adding steamed and baked char siu bao, along with other popular dim sum that will appeal to a good cross section of people."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I have had the chicken corn soup, Mongolian beef both the organic & the regular gmo, organic tastes better, & the Pacific shrimp balls. The shrimp balls are huge & tasty, chicken corn soup is hearty & filling. 
The price is kind of high for what you get. I would think that for $13.88 for a large to go container you would be getting a small rice. But I guess \"organic\" means added cost. 
The restaurant is clean & the employees are nice. 
For Chinese fast food it's pretty good. Much better than panda express."}
{"text":"Found this place beside Denny's restaurant. Its a clean fast food restaurant. They have vegetarian menu if you're a vegan. The thing that i noticed about their place is that it is similar to Panda Express, the difference is they don't have their food out. Everything is cooked fresh when you order it. So you have to wait for 15mins which is why i gave them 4 stars since i don't like waiting. I ordered beef broccoli which was $4.88, that's the smallest box where i got a side and one entree. The food was good and tasty. The beef was soft. I looked up the reviews at yelp and saw that they have shui mai, and i remember my boyfriend wants those so i ordered some for to go which she said would take 10-12mins. The lady told me that she only have 2 shumai left which sucks. The lady was very helpful. I only saw 2 workers in the restaurant. The price is a little bit too much, but i guess its worth it for the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Immediately went in and was greeted warmly. The place wad very clean and I love the flower printed things on the ceiling. The menu was a little confusing but the servers helped me to understand how to order. Everything was made fresh and only took about 10 minutes total. I got the California broccoli beef with orange chicken with the long life noodles. It was delicious. I love how the servers greet you as you come in.  I would definitely be back sometime soon"}
{"text":"Well I waited a month for this place to open.  Some how 4 wings and 2 pieces of dimsum with some noddles cost me 20$.  I explained to them I had ordered the side of noddles 3.99 the appetizer 298 pick two (chicken wing and spring roll)  and two peiece of dim sum 188 each.  10 bucks is what I come up to 12 with my drink.  but it was 18.99.

It was bad.  It really isn't a dimsum place.  I had to throw away my meal after a couple of bites.  The staff was very nice and pleasant.

I went to jack in the box and got two tacos and a plain hamburger because I was starving.  cost 2.14.  

really bummed wanted it to be good so bad."}
{"text":"Love the no msg added and organic choices. Very good service too. Dim sum is pretty good."}
{"text":"Will never come back here again. The reason why i gave 2 stars was for the cleanliness of the place. Food wasnt good. I came in and all the employees were sitting down in the dining room and on their phones or laptop. The thing that really annoyed me was that they ran out of almost everything. I came for dimsum and they only have shrimp shumai and steamed pork bun left. They dont have bottled water...they were out of the shrimp on their list of entrees. I tasted the shumai and steamed pork bun and it wasn't even good. I regret paying $14 for my meal. Yes its overpriced too."}
{"text":"We finally broke down to give this place a try.  The staff are very friendly and the place is very clean but that is the only two good things about the place.  My husbands whole dinner went in the garbage, he ordered pork chop and shrimp which were so tough he couldn't eat it.  The rice and noodles seemed to of been cooked at another time and reheated in oil (a lot of oil).  A lot of the items on the menu weren't available. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good service,HORRIBLE & overpriced food. These morons need to go down to Chinatown & see what dim sum is. This place is like Panda Express,not dim sum. Worst shumai dumplings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pros- staff is friendly and food comes out hot and fresh 
Cons- Panda Express is just as good (if not better) and cheaper."}
{"text":"The food was hella good. I like the Mongolian beef, I like pretty cashier, they asked me if I needed anything.I just needed their number lol."}
{"text":"Came here to just pick up some steamed rice and they seem to be pretty unpopular. All of their steamers are off so I'm assuming their food is cooked fresh. 

I had a couple in front of me and while they were ordering they were debating what they wanted and the cashier told them that one of the items they were thinking about was \"nasty\". My jaw basically hit the floor when she said that. I don't think she intended to say it that way but it came out sounding bad. I haven't tried their actual food but I'm not sure I want to try it knowing an employee thinks it's \"nasty\"."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant in Vegas I ever walked out of and demanded my money back!  This is a fast food type place. It was a Saturday around noon and the place was empty, we were the only customers. When my wife and I got our orders the portions were tiny, they put them in those little sectioned off plates,  and the rice side was huge, the entrees  were about 1.5'x 1.5' and about .25' deep. Not a lot of food for 12 bucks (for one order) I  am a vegetarian and I had a vegetable dish, the only vegetables in it were snap peas and tiny cut up pieces of green zucchini, Nothing else no carrots, broccoli, water chestnuts, yellow zucchini and some gross liquids all over it. I think it must have been boiled and not steamed. The tofu dish tasted disgusting and looked that way too. they did provide a lot of rice which was the only decent thing on the plate. Oh for being a healthy place? no low sodium soy sauce-not too healthy!  My wife isnt a vegitarian and orderd a shrimp dish, and a chicken dish. She didn't know she ordered fake shrimp (which they charged me an additional charge for as it was real shrimp). It was disgusting- she threw it out. That's when she wanted our money back, they gave me 11 bucks back and a receipt showing they gave me 27 bucks back (the cost of both meals) I just wanted out of there! lunch was ruined. I will NEVER, NEVER NEVER BE BACK OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, Look if you want fast food Chinese there are other competitors that are much better (although with this place its not a high bar) and give you more value for your money."}
{"text":"Get the GROUPON!  Total deal!!  $24 for $40.  Nice clean place. You might think this is another fast Chinese food restaurant but it's all made fresh when you order!  I chose 2 items and a side for around $9.  They have some healthier and or vegetarian options!  The chicken and beef was tasty and tender not chewey or fatty.   Oh and great fried rice and loved the extra fat noodles!"}
{"text":"so there we go ...try and eat out instead of pick up....
we thought it was ok...commercially acceptable....
we don't like people much...so maybe I should not say ...then   the food could speak for itself...
commercially acceptable....
other places next....."}
{"text":"Food looked like it would be good but very bland and the fried rice was mushy... We were the only ones in the restaurant.  Thank goodness I had a groupon!"}

{"text":"Dim Sum = Dim Out
So excited when driving down Charleston and I see a restaurant advertising Dim Sum. So excited after passing it I made a U-turn to check it out. Appearing nice and clean, I entered during the lunch hour and only two other people were there. 
I walked up to the counter to place my order. I first asked for Chicken Shu Mai, I was told they were out. Then I asked about the Steamed Buns. I was told they were out of anything that had chicken. So I asked for the Steamed BBQ Pork Buns. The cashier went around to the kitchen, came back and said they were out of those too. Finally I said, what do you have? and proceeded to order. I had the Pork Soup Dumplings, Shrimp Shu Mai and Fried Shrimp Ball. By the way, they have no vegetable dim sum. I was told it would take about 15 minutes. That's time to get the frozen product out, thaw, steam and or fry. The food was ok.  I most likely could have gotten the same items at Costco and cooked it myself at home. Behind the counter, there are empty steamers. I'm guessing when they first opened they cooked a lot of food that unfortunately went unsold, so now they cook to order. I may try again, just to see how there entrees taste. They appeared to be freshly prepared and I did see some vegetables in one order."}
{"text":"From 3/5/16
Whelp, I hate to leave a bad review, but this situation left me with no choice. The food here is left out too long, to the point of becoming inedible. I ordered the walnut shrimp, but the girl mistakenly gave me garlic shrimp. When I sat down and noticed I had the wrong shrimp. I thought give it back, as I glanced down I noticed the sauce was gelatinous, I almost ralphed upon looking at it. I was like \"This isn't the right shrimp, need to say something!\" I go up get the walnut shrimp and it was the same issue; it was slimy seafood. 

Needless to say, we did not finish are food, only ate a few of the noodles. I hope this place wises up and starts putting out fresh food because there is nothing more disappointing than getting bad food."}
{"text":"ChiAm.  On craig and Jones.Drove by mutiple times couldn't wait to try. Wow just like Panda Express nothing to be excited about just allot more money, and food was cold. Tried and denied won't be back!"}
{"text":"Not good at all....walking in, the place had a super weird vibe, but we were already there and decided to give it a try.  There was one person there (besides the 2 employees working), and he didn't appear to even be \"dining\", just on his computer the entire time.  So we walk in, and there's many little covered tin dishes with labels, as if insinuating that those items were hiding under the lids waiting to be served up. When we ask to see the items, the gal behind the counter tells us that the items don't even exist.  So..... weird exhibit A.  Moving onto Weird exhibit B, we look above at the wall mounted menu and tell the girl what we would like to order.  And everything is made to order.  So..... it's a dim sum place, but made to order. Oooook. Fine.  Considering the depths of our hangover and hunger levels, the rice was on point, being compared to roadkill that is.  A solid 2 out of 10 stars.  Ok, that's being nice. But it wasn't awful... the mixed vegetables were no better than Panda Express, actually they weren't even that good.  And the teriyaki chicken sucked!  Again, considering the hangover and hunger, we ate it.  Even the \"hot mustard\" packets that Chinese food lovers adore had zero burn.  No nasal burn like we all love.  Don't wast your time...."}
{"text":"This place has a really good selection for food and their wait staff is extremely friendly - the only down side was their soda machine was practically out of everything to drink. The food was tasty and since it is cooked to order was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Great Dim Sum, queen steamed rice! Good portion and super tasty food. Really a little nougat to eat a snack or meal. Great friendly service too. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"There was an article in our local paper that said this was a fast casual Chines and Dim Sum Restaurant.  I guess that is true if you consider the dim sum 4 choices of siu mai with different meats.  The chicken corn soup was the best thing we had.  They do offer organic choices which is what drew me to this place but those dishes are $3 more and I wonder how they work that out when it comes to cooking (in the same woks? with the same utensils?).  Granted they had smaller portions that they served from so I would think that they would be fresher as they would have to cook them more often but many items looked like they had been sitting there for a while.   Basically it is just a glorified version of Panda Express."}
{"text":"Service excellent. Beef Broccoli very good. Orange Chicken good but there was no Orange sauce. Dim Sum was Just Ok. Kind of strange tasting. Shrimp Fried Ball was good. King Fried Rice has no Meat, Which makes it bland. To expensive for Just Ok Food."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dining experience!  The food is fantastic!  Can't believe how healthy everything is!!!!  Really top notch service too!  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, greeted me right when I walked in, was a nice touch.  Very clean, food was spectacular!  Wow!  And I'm from NJ so you know I take my Chinese food seriously!  Couldn't believe the price!  Very reasonable for made to order.  No MSG too.  They have the coke machine so have every selection imaginable!!!!  I strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decent food, ok taste, but quantity is not the best. I believe they could have given more food on my plate. A little pricey for the amount. Of food received. I am satisfied because I purchased a groupon for $12 for $20 worth. They were out of a lot of foods as well, which are the most popular foods at 3pm on a Saturday. Staff was very nice and it was very clean. Ok for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"I put one star so I could write the review. I would put 0 if I could. They didn't have half the items on their menu. No organic meats, no shrimp, no dim sum. I got a groupon for $20 worth and was 50cents under $20, and they made me purchase something else to go over $20.  The food quality was mediocre to say in the least. When I opened my plate I was amazed at how tiny the portion was! I will never be coming back and DO NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in town. Its always made hot and fresh and it tastes different...like...less salty than other Chinese food. I never feel blothed after eating it and its satisfying food. I love the Florida (Orange) Chicken and Teriyaki with noodles. Their noodles are the best! Icing on cake...the have Dim Sum...but only sometimes...and its variety is based off what that have which changes daily. When its available though...its delicious."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Bring back quadobas please.. looks like a fast Panda Express type of place. Me and my girlfriend were the only people getting food and it took over 20 minutes for them to make our food. The dim sum was disgusting not worth 1.68 a piece more like 5 cents"}
{"text":"While this is not a bad place to eat it's really not a dim sum restaurant. They have some dumplings but it's basically a nicer more modern version of your corner Chinese food take out place. I'm not sure I'll go back but it was worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night. It's a clean and nicely decorated fast food restaurant. They have vegetarian menu if you're a vegan and list of organic entrees. Everything is cooked fresh when you order it. We waited about  15 mins or so.

We ordered several dim sum such as Pork sui mai, Shrimp dumplings, Shrimp Sui Mai,  Pork Soup Dumplings and for entree, Tiger Walnut shrimp which was my favorite and I love the crispy Vegetable spring rolls. Also we tried Jumbo Pacific shrimp ball. 

The food were better than I thought it would be. 
A lot of stuff were out that night. I asked for Veggie Tofu soup but there were out and the girl that worked there said they could make Egg drop soup with corn. That was not on the menu but nonetheless the soup was very tasty.  I would come back for some quick dim sum fix."}
{"text":"I reviewed this restaurant at the grand opening and thought it was excellent. I took my wife there for lunch today and was not disappointed. The store was very clean and comfortable.  Apparently, the Health Department had been there earlier in the day and the location had retained its A rating. Now for the food:  we both ordered combo platters for $10.88 each, that included rice or organic noodles, two regular entrees and a beverage. Appetizers can be substituted for entrees. Unlike Panda, the taste was not bland or overwhelmingly sweet.  The meat was tender and the vegetables fresh.  No dreaded MSG, only healthful organic ingredients, I really feel good about having lunch there!  We ordered the beef and broccoli, chicken wings, shrimp balls and noodles. I have included a photo below. I am very suspicious about the lower ratings given by a few others and would suspect they are written at the request of competitors."}
{"text":"I had previously reviewed ChiAm's first location at Jones and Craig shortly after opening.  I saw the Charleston location, and decided to give it a try.  The business is hard to see from the street, but right across from the Community College.  It was noon, but the business had few customers.  Nonetheless, based upon the excellent experience at the other store, I ordered the $8.88 combo.  Noodles, rice or vegetables plus 2 protein entrees.  I had the mandarin chicken and the beef with broccoli...then waited 10-15 minutes.   Everything was made to order, but worth the wait.   Piping hot, large quantities of very tasty food rivaling the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas.  Quality ingredients make it really stand out against Panda (my opinion).  I posted a photo of my order with this review."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious, this is definitely a different (and delicious) experience. Service is great, restaurant is immaculate, and the food is definitely worth waiting for. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. They no longer carry the vegetarian pepper steak or any vegan dim sum. I ordered the walnut shrimp ($13.88), Mongolian beef ($11.88), and vegan shrimp ($11.88) total ($40+) and received three little cardboard cartons. Period. Definitely not the portions I received at the Jones/Craig location that closed, and definitely not worth what I paid. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Dimsum at its finest at ChiAm Restaurant.  Siumais are tasty and not soggy. Buns and dumplings also are fresh and flavorful. Food are also served in huge portions. Place is decent and casual looking."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh Chinese dishes to choose from! My soon to be daughter in law & I decided to check this new place out for lunch. Affordable and fresh delicious Chinese food and a fortune cookie  too! Love the decor with pretty red parasols hanging from the ceiling!"}
{"text":"ChiAm is located in a little corner across from the College of Southern Nevada, and claims to specialize in Dim Sum. The exterior is simple and appealing, especially to those who appreciate good Chinese dumplings. 

I felt immensely welcome waking in, save for the usual awkwardness of coming into a (personally) new restaurant. The overall layout mimics a basic Panda Express, and the food itself looked somewhat old. This could be due to their lack of consistent clientele, considering that they are fairly new. I'd like to say that the food would have probably been fresh had we come at a busy hour. The food itself was both delicious and disappointing. The sweet and sour shrimp dish was my main concern. I should have sampled it beforehand; the texture was a bit off. 

However, their tofu and chicken dishes were excellent. Specifically the tofu. It made up for the inconsistencies of the shrimp. The Dim Sum was tasty, but again, probably sat out for a little longer than comfortable. The textures were great, flavor was there, and appearance was on point. 

The young lady at the front was patient with us and absolutely wonderful. A very great personality who jumped at the chance to assist us. Overall, the service was excellent. 

I'm positive that with more customers, this place would be a five star eatery. We intend to come again, with even higher expectations."}
{"text":"My food was made to order and was very fresh and tasty. The order-taker was super friendly and the vibe wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food. The place is clean and has a friendly staff. I was the only person when I went it, so the service was really fast. I see a lot of of people complain about the pricing, but they reduced the prices from what I saw. You can get a two item combo with your choice of white rice, fried rice, or noodles. Everything is made to order, so everything you get is fresh. Its in a shopping center right by CSN on Charleston, so it was weird that no one else was in there."}
{"text":"Freshly made food, reasonable prices, perfect portions. Super clean. Best orange chicken."}
{"text":"Horrible. Serving shumai does not make a restaurant a dim sum place.  This is a terrible copy of Panda Express.  Tried the teriyaki chicken and walnut shrimp.  3 pieces of shrimp and 4 pieces of chicken and rice for 12 bucks.  If it was good then maybe. Yuck"}
{"text":"Five stars on service alone. They were so sweet and accommodating. But we're not all here for just service right ... This place also offers Chinese food. Good selection of dim sum! Didn't have my fav beef balls but that's ok lol I love that they use organic ingredients and have veggie options. 20% discount if you work nearby! They're a new place so show some love!"}
{"text":"It's a 15 minute wait for it mediocre fast food dim sum and they won't even serve you a glass of water this place is a joke"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  Now the bad part is this particular unit. And shopping center, has the worst luck staying in business.  Every place that faces the street has good luck in this shopping center but this particular unit was both a Smash Burger and a Mexican restaurant (I can't remember the name).  So they were set for struggles from the get go.  

This restaurant's biggest problem is identity.  They continuously try to identify what they are.    The menu board stays the same but how they represent the items change.  Sometimes it's a lot of food, or a little.  Prices are fluctuating   The lunches were big when they were 10-13  and became small when they developed a spring lunch special (that is still going on).

The food quality has ranged from freshly cooked and delicious sauces to rip off of Panda.  I still like it for that quick bite since I work across the street, but it's hard to predict what my food will look like and that is straying my business away over the past couple of months.

The identity crisis only increases when I see other locations in town that don't seem to struggle.  My suggestions, change the dim sum menu and face it towards the front entrance and find ways to make that be part of the special for the day.  If you get more focus on items 5 dollars or less, you will appeal more to the neighborhood we are in.  From there, advertise to CSN with food samples and flyers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch (around 2:30 pm) a couple weeks ago. The steam tables were all shut down. They fixed my Mongolian beef fresh, but that didn't help--it was oily, had no spice, and was a really small portion.  The fried rice was a huge pile, and it was salty mush."}
{"text":"Not sure why there's so much bad reviews for this place, it was really good honestly.... Not up to par with the most amazing dim sum but I enjoyed it! 
The shrimp was really good and my kids loved everything... Place is nice and clean and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food!!! Tin Sing's was a favorite of mine when I lived in Cali, because it feature amazing dishes and egg rolls big as a cucumbers:). I am particular because Panda Express  is the only option for fast Chinese American food.  

Everything is prepared fresh in this place. The front end ladies are very personable. I had the Pacific Shrimp Ball. Great signature dish. Never had a shrimp ball. Yummy, yummy - it was hot and light. The shrimp was fresh and the coating crunchy enough to give the perfect balance. I also ordered the vegetable roll, crispy and light outer shell that allowed you to actually taste the delicious filling inside. Yum!!! 

I am a foodie!!! I also ordered the shrimp vegetables and spare ribs for the entree. Light not greasy. Clean and freshly ptepared. The staff was very accomadating. I am glad they opened in that shopping center and I will return.

Best of luck, to you!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but wow.... that food was the worse I've ever had. I couldn't even finish my first bite of my favorite siu mai, made me nauseous.

Again nice staff, just food was horrible. This explains why they are empty."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't get it. ChiAm? Haven't we already turned Chinese food into American food? This felt like the same thing in a different wrapper. It reminded me of Mexican places that sell Tacos and Enchiladas served on a fancy plate and charge $11.99 for 3 tacos. Had the mandarin chicken with rice and tried some other dish my gf ordered. It was fine, tasted like Panda Express to me. They were out of shrimp. It took forever to get my food and it cost $13. Strange décor that's neither American nor Chinese. Like there's nothing I liked about this place. The end."}
{"text":"The dumplings were very tasty...but a bit expensive for one--they are sold individually.  It would have been a little better had they come two in an order for that price.  My family ordered 12 & it was over $20.  The cashier was friendly & restaurant was clean.  Perhaps we will have to try the other entrees."}
{"text":"The food is way too good here. Especially shrimp ball. I have tried every single menu here and they are all delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"This place NEVER has their full dim sum menu. Before the w craig location was the same. Service always friendly,  food always good and price is ok."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon $12 for $20 worth of food. Good thing I got the Groupon because the food is pricey for what it is. The food was not that flavorful and some of the quantities were small. Might as well go to Panda and pay $6. They also didn't have some of the foods we wanted to order. However, the restaurant was nice and clean. I loved the ceiling deco."}
{"text":"Well, I think this place has potential but it's not there.  The food was good but way to heavily sauced.   The Mongolian beef tasted great but again over-sauced.  Same with the chicken.   I think the food needs a bit of a fix.   Everything is done fresh.   Location is a bit hidden.  I think if you improved food, lowered cost, and moved to better location it may be a to-go place.   For now, not on my list."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because I wanted to try a dim sum place near me and this didn't disappoint. A little bit pricey but the quantity of food sure did fill me up. Quality of the food wasn't too bad for a fast food dim sum. They have free wifi and the service is phenomenal! I would definitely recommend this place to others especially in the area."}
{"text":"It seems every time I come here the main thing I come here for is pork & shrimp siu mai which is my favorite. They are either always out of it or only have a couple pieces left.... The staff tends to know very little about customer service and often is not capable of taking care of issues without contacting someone at another location... I don't know how this location continues to function...."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 3 stars for right now.  We have been seeing commercials on TV about this place having Organic selections and natural items.  The commercials also advertise they are having their grand opening, so we decided to go support them as we LOVE organic and really wanted to try this place.

The day we went, Meagan was very helpful along with Karla the Manager.  Unfortunately last week was NOT their Grand Opening, it was a soft opening which means, they did not have anything organic or natural available as of yet.  Also, they only accepted cash, they could not accept credit or debit.

Everything was explained about the menu and the Dim Sum has a much larger selection then the other store.

So, wait about another week as they were not sure exactly when the Grand Opening would be or when they would have everything up and running and ready to go.  I am sure once this place gets up and running to full capacity it will be a 5 star place.  

As for now, the location was pretty easy to find, right across from the CSN Campus, it was clean, they will run out of seat once fully open at certain times throughout the day but that means they are having some great success. 

Give this place a try and give them support as there are NOT a lot of places in town that serve this style of food and go out of their way to use Organic and Natural ingredients."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. It's very clean. Friendly without being in-your-face friendly. The food tasted good. Not crazy awesome but better than I thought. Tasted better than biting into a handful of grease or nothing at all, as I tend to describe most Asian cuisine places like that. I enjoyed it and it wasn't too expensive. Was like $24 for two platters of two entries and rice with two free drinks. Might eat here again."}
{"text":"Introduction:
We were definitely reluctant in trying ChiAm out based on the reviews.  I must say that my friend and I were super glad we decided to try it out.  From the reviews, it appears to us that the owners must have made some adjustments since. For example, everything is now made to order. Which is awesome, pro-everything was so fresh.  Cons-you do have to wait, but totally worth it.

Quality: 5/5
We had the King Fried Riceu, Mongolian Beef and Florida Orange Chicken combo, probably one of the tastiest fried rice and Orange Chicken I've had in awhile. The Mongolian Beef was good too, but I've had better.

In addition, we had the Chicken Sui Mai, Chicken Dumpling, BBQ Pork Bun and Red Bean Bun. I must say, I was surprised how good they were as well. I love the fact that you can order any of those options without shrimps, usually, I have to remove my shrimps from other Dim Sum places and by the time I am done, I get exhausted.

Quantity & Price: 5/5
The portions were generous for the price.  $8.88 for three items is amazing. Two Dim Sum items from a portion of the Menu for $2.88 & three Dim Sum items from another Menu for $4.88 is definitely a killer deal.  

The one thing I must caution you on is that you need ro read the Menu's carefully. For example, if it reads two for $2.88, Mix and Match, that means if you want two of something, you have to let the cashier know. I was a dork, I completely missed that \"Mix and Match\" verbiage. But that was my bad, thank goodness I had enough to eat because of their combo portion generosity.

Cleanliness: 5/5
The place was super clean, including the restroom. The utensils, quality napkin and self serve drink areas were kept up and maintain immaculately.

Customer Service: 5/5
Claudia was amazing, super accommodating and very patience with us.  Because it's our first time, she answers all our questions with ease and did not appeared annoyed by us. Thank you Claudia! We appreciate that :)

Tips:
Check in on Yelp to get a 20% off. In addition, right now, you can get $20 for $12 from Groupon, that's what prompt us to try ChiAm out in the first place. It works, cause we're definitely going to be back.  I hope this place will be sticking around cause we really like it."}
{"text":"We should have gone next door to DickBlick, bought crayons and ate them. Worst Chinese fast food ever.  Glad I did it as a Groupon. I would needed astroglide if I paid full price. I bet this place tanks soon.  The pork dim sum tastes gamely and smells like a stockyard. The shrimp was watery. They cook to order so that is one on the first signs of trouble. Just don't do it! Think of the children and whales and gorillas in the mist. This is drunk food to throw on booze after a binder"}
{"text":"Groupon ftw! Came here to redeem a Groupon on $20 worth of food and wasn't disappointed with the portions and quality. Also loved the organic options which meant the hubby who isn't a Chinese food fan and eats organic enjoyed his meal."}
{"text":"Not bad but I'm confused... I was really excited to try this place because I thought it was a dim sum place. There really wasn't much to choose from as far as dim sum goes and the couple that I tried were overpriced and not that great. This place is pretty much a glorified Panda Express that costs nearly double what Panda Express charges. If the food was that much better than Panda then ok, but it wasn't. The food was fresh, I'll give them that but WAYYYYYY too salty. I'd rather just go to Panda across the street. I'll try this place again later if/when they actually have dim sum."}
{"text":"It was horrible experience. We ordered 2 plates and some dim sum. We waited more than an hour to get our order! The food is mediocre. I would not recommend to go to this restaurant for bad service and not so good food."}
{"text":"Like other reviews said. I'm confused. Where were the dim sum choices? Only shumai and shrimp ball. They should change their signage. Wasn't a fan of the shumai. The shrimp balls were really good I have to admit. 
Honestly I would have knocked this Place down to 2 stars but the other dishes were decent and my boyfriend liked it.  You can taste the food was fresh. Except for maybe the walnut shrimp.  Looked like it had been sitting there for a while. They make the entrees in smaller batches. They offer \"organic\" option for a higher price. I say pass and save your money get the traditional version."}
{"text":"just wasted my time driving all the way across town to try this place and apparently they're closed because too many people were getting food poisoning here! good to know!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that this place isn't closer to my house/work. Yes, you'll pay a little more than other places in town, but the food is obviously higher quality... No mystery meat like at other Chinese places. It's worth it to me to pay a little more to know what I'm eating. 

Also, the staff is really friendly. I've never walked into a fast food restaurant and been greeted so warmly. I'm glad they'll be opening more locations around town."}
{"text":"Came here around the afternoon. The Cashier was very helpful and attentive. Food came out in a timely manner. I like how its freshly made. The food was good and service with a smile."}
{"text":"The place looks nice and modern inside. We were excited to eat dim sum... unfortunately getting there an hour before closing wasn't enough because they stopped serving 2 hours before closing! Very upsetting. Did I forget to mention the young lady who was waiting to serve us was unaccommodating and the menu gave us no options. Literally had 6 options of meals. Don't even bother asking for a substitution for veggies instead of the rice or noodles. Save your time and money for the real dim sum restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Very very slow to order and get food. Interesting. I'd say similar to Panda Express but far less food and not as flavorful.  Quite expensive, too, for the little bit of food. Plus they were out of organic vegetables! We thought they must be a new place with everyone learning but they've been open 8 months! Doubt we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Everything at this restaurant is made to order and excellent. It is casual, clean and friendly. We had Dim Sum and it was delicious as was the Long Life Noodles. I highly recommend this little gem of a restaurant. Don't forget to try the Chocolate Espresso"}
{"text":"They were out of half of the things on the menu.  They let us know ahead of time of the things they were out of and then 5 minutes after I ordered they said they were out of that too. They didn't have water bottles and when i asked for a water cup and went to the beverage station they didn't even have water. The food was very good though so still 3 stars."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the whole concept of this place seems off.  Are you trying to be the next panda express? But wait you serve fast food Chinese food, but it's not fast...it's cooked to order.  Hmmmm how are you going to survive?  I walked in and this place was empty, albeit friendly staff that showed me the menu and explained the food.  No clue why this is labeled dim sum, there is shu mai and dumplings...that's it.  I ordered the longevity noodles and beef and broccoli.  The noodles were tastier than Panda Express, but the beef and broccoli was very similar.  They also have a very limited menu of food options compared to Panda Express and the food is more expensive.  They do however have an organic option...  All in all, I don't get the concept and I don't think they are going to make it very long.  More expensive and slower than Panda Express with less options.  If you are going to setup like a fast food joint, you have to be fast and you have to appeal to that clientele.  It's like they want to be one step higher than Panda Express but they don't deliver the goods."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 2 stars because of the soda fountain and the finalized customer service, not the start of the customer service tho.  They close at 8pm from what I overheard, and I arrived at 705pm to see everything clean and shiny, so I got excited about great food potential.  First time there, and couldn't quite figure out the menu and prices, but I saw what I wanted up there and was told, \"we're out of\" to the two items I really wanted.  So, then I ordered and was willing to pay extra for the shrimp options, only to be told; \"just so you know, when you order shrimp there is only 3 pieces\"...so...scratch the shrimp option!  

Basically, for $11+ this dinner was a disappointment for something I could have gotten at PandaExpress and known exactly what I was getting.  She did try to redeem herself, between chat messages on her cellphone, by stating \"we make everything fresh to order here\" as she saw me start to ask a question.  That's great, happy to know it's going to be fresh!  And that I can say was true, the food was fresh!  I'm also going to add the food was not saturated in sugary or salt - and had decent flavor - but it begged something more - not sure what that \"more\" would be, but it was missing that \"ohhhh yeah, I'll be back\" factor.  

Then, call me picky, but I've never EVER been to any kind of Asian based food establishment that doesn't give a fortune cookie.  I was truly disappointed with that.  Kinda happy to see the cashier put down her phone long enough to check up on my food, and bring it to me personally rather than leave it on the counter.  Figured it was because I was the last customer of the day, or close to it.  I'll probably be back, because I really REALLY want to try their walnut shrimp or tiger shrimp but I can guarantee I won't go at the end of their business day again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by this place. I regret going here for lunch today. Panda Express is way better option than the food and service here."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Both times not one soul dining in the place , yet they have 5 employees behind the counter. It is exactly the same setup as Panda Express , but their pitch is they have organic options and dim sum. The Dim sum is nothing to rave about and I ordered food to go and they told me there would be a 10 minute wait. It looked like everything was already out , but they probably cook the Dim sum to order so as not to waste. After 10 minutes I asked if it was ready , and it was another 10 minutes. You get that impression when you're eating the food , that \"I waited for this ?\". One Asian woman walked in , asked a few questions , and walked out ! Probably misled by all the Dim Sum banners hanging outside. In my experience , if there is never anyone at an eatery ; it's probably NO GOOD !!! I'm not going back. If you go there , check out the Proclamation certificate hanging near the drinks. It states Chiam is changing the field in Quality Chinese fast food. I don't know about that !!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  I like that the food was made fresh for us and tasted great.  The wait seemed a little long just because there were only two people working.  However those two that were there were very helpful and rushing around trying to get everyone their orders as fast as possible."}
{"text":"I like ChiAm better than Panda Express because the menu is much more varied and extensive, primarily because of the dim sum and made to order items."}
{"text":"I am not sure what to make of ChiAm.  They seem to have an identity crisis with the dim sum as part of it's brand name.   I was hoping for a good quality dim sum place opening up in North Las Vegas, but I was highly disappointed with the selections of dim sum.  The few varieties of shumai, which were okay and nothing to rave about.  The other dishes were really salty and blend. The food was also really expensive for what they offered compare to Panda Express and other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I am totally confused about this place. Went to this place to get some dimsum and all they have are shumai's ( chicken, shrimp, beef & pork). No varieties whatsoever to be called a dimsum place. The shumai that I tried are dry and does not have the best of taste. I guess back to Chinatown for me. Not going back to this place coz I just wasted my money."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant because they have the friendly staff and good dim sum. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"First impressions are always the greatest it took me forever to get someone from the back to the front of the restaurant to create an order. They do not even let you see the food by lifting up the cover only in pictures but it is available on the front line which I thought was interesting. Also by the time I want it to make my order they said they ran out of noodle and the lady said she didn't know when they were going to make any more.

This place did not leave me dying to come back"}
{"text":"It's new so it's clean. Friendly employees.. I got 2 of each shumai (chicken, pork/shrimp, and beef). All were good and fresh except the beef. It had a funky taste. Also got the pacific shrimp ball which was good. Only gave 3 stars because of \"dim sum\" selection and price was a little on the high side. 
They said they'll be getting more of a dim sum selection.........

Note* I'll go back for a quick snack"}
{"text":"Came here for the grand opening after we heard about it on the radio. Before setting foot inside we saw a couple of customers, so we decided to give it a try. So we walked in and then we were told they are not open. Why would you have the lights on and doors open if you're not open? Bad business! So, we went next door to another restaurant instead. We had a great meal at Great Links, as always! When we went back to our car we noticed a few more customers inside getting food. What the heck????"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and pushes cooked to order vegetarian choices. Clean kind and friendly courteous service I think I'll come back specials as low as 4.88."}
{"text":"No Stars Here!!! 

Drove a long way to have Dim Sum and got there 1 1/2 before they closed at 8, but they stop serving all but 6 items on the menu at 6pm. They wouldn't even do any substitutions. 
So I saw a Thai place in the same parking lot, Thai Bistro! Really nice place and great service!! 

Don't bother coming to this Chinese Restaurant it's a waste n bad attitude n service!!!"}
{"text":"There's never anyone in this place (it's next to Walmart where I buy my groceries) but I thought I would give it a try anyways. I have only come one other time to get some quick dim sum but only left with two shrimp dumpling because everything else I would have had to wait 15 min for. This time I got the side + two entree special. I also wanted to see if I could pick up some dim sum as well but again, there would be a 15 min wait (I get it, there's not enough foot traffic in this place for them to have the dim sum sitting out) but still, disappointing. So I opted not to wait. One of my entrees was the honey walnut shrimp, so understandably there was an added cost. I was very disappointed with the shrimp; not only did I receive only 3-4 of them, but the mayo cream sauce was OLD. It was pretty disgusting, I could barely eat it, it smelled so bad. Overall, too pricey for the quality of food that is given. Would not come again."}
{"text":"This is like a healthier, fresher version of Panda Express, except they actually cook the food fresh for you!! Super friendly service, however menu is often limited with not much dim sum to really choose from.  Since they are a made to order type restaurant, it's not really all that fast. But overall, the quality isn't bad :) 

I had shrimp and fried rice, and the shrimp (big prawns) were fresh and cooked well. The order came with 3 pieces. The rice on the other hand was just mediocre, about on par with Panda Express....

Would recommend if you're in the area, but would not drive out of the way to come here."}
{"text":"I figured they would close by year end last year- made it a few more months then closed door- too bad tho- it had potential as a quality Chinese food grille."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious the food is so unique and it's friendly to everyone. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to try Chinese style food. It's super convenient, right in the corner to be noticed."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this place. I was anxious for it to open as I often make my Starbucks run next door. I decided to try it tonight. You can get a two meal option, or Order items individually. The first issue I have is for the \"organic two item\" it's $13.99. For the regular two item it's $10.99. This seems a little higher priced, but fine totally I'm willing to try it... Especially if I find its worth being a little more pricey than most Chinese we have tried in the area. The problem is more than half of the items are \"organic\" so your options are pretty limited. In closing, we get our food and it was HORRIBLE. I don't even know where to start!The noodles were sticky and dry... The rice was crunchy like it had been sitting for days, the Mongolian beef was probably as equivalent to dog food as it comes, and the orange chicken tasted like it had been microwaved several times throughout the day. On that note we demanded a refund and walked out! Our first clue should've been that the place was empty! Yes it's Beautiful, and clean but extremely over priced and terrible food!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. It was really good-fresh very clean. It's very modern looking sleek inside. Everything is cooked on the spot (takes about 15mins after you order). Just remember Dim-Sum is Small portions-combo fried rice was good. They did not have chicken-for any of the meals .
The drink machine had some issues but the pink lemonade was good."}
