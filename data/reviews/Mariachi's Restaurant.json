{"text":"It near my feieds palce so we come here once a month.


It is very authentic mexican food.   We shared 


Polls poblano    it was ok but nothing as special as it sound  on menu


Chicken fajitas    very solid , very Flavourful and not dry or iver cooked like other place.

Chip and quacamole   is amazing but pricy .sounds simple but most do make it that well





Sat in the back . It ia nice and quiet."}
{"text":"I had the guacamole and the fish tacos which were both good but not amazing. I like Mexican food and I've definitely had better - especially considering the prices were on the more expensive side. The service, however, was definitely lacking. It took a while to order and the food took well over 30 minutes. Afterwards we asked for the dessert menu as we were craving Churros but also wanted to see other options on the menu. The waiter forgot to bring over the menu until we reminded him 10 minutes later, and once we finally ordered Churros he told us they had just served the last one and they were out. So we waited for the bill which took another 10 minutes and then just walked up to the cash. Overall I still think it's a good place to eat in the neighbourhood (probably more so when their patio is open) but they could benefit from focusing more on the quality of the food and the service."}
{"text":"Wow - absolutely everything was wrong. Hadn't been here in years, although had a vague recollection the margaritas and food were good. I guess when it's dark outside you don't notice how dirty and tired the place is. Stairs to washrooms in basement are dangerous to start with. The rubber matting on the stairs is buckling and washroom feels somewhat less than clean. I actually made a reservation for lunch (silly me) as the place used to always be busy. There was one other table occupied when we arrived, this on a Friday at Yonge & Eg. Even the menus are dirty - the coated plastic variety that never seem to get wiped down. Ditto for the dessert menus. Pretty basic menu of Tex- Mex which was disappointing. We ordered the guacamole which was nice and fresh, and the mixed fajitas for two, which were nothing special, in fact, make better ones at home myself. Toppings include some shredded lettuce, a tiny bit of sour cream, and a little bit of grated cheese. But the kicker was when we received the bill, which seemed a little high. Guacamole on the menu is $6,95, yet they charged $8,95, double fajitas $24.95, and they tried to charge us $32.95 on the bill. When we pointed out the error to the waiter he said he would have to call the owner (on his cell phone). I said there was no point in calling the owner, as it was illegal to charge us different than the advertised amount on the menu. Will definitely never go back, and suspecting that Mariachi's is not long for the restaurant world."}
{"text":"Great guacamole, they put a little salsa on top which gives it a lot of flavour! A lot of places don't do this, but it's the trick. Good portion of guac as well. 

I ordered the taquitos, those were very bland, but everything else that my family ordered (enchiladas, steak and tacos) were great! I got a piece of the steak and it was sooooooooo good. It also had bits of cactus on too. 

They could really improve on service. The service was slow, they look way too long to take our food order, even after waving down 2 servers to get our server, it at least took 10-15 mins. 

Great desserts, we got the churros, and those were delicious. My boyfriend really loved this place and is eager to go back."}
{"text":"Dear fellow reviewers: this is not real Mexican food...it's not even particularly good food.

This place commits what, in my mind, is the greatest possible sin in so-called \"Mexican\" cooking:: the \"beef\" is ground beef. Mexican food is all about the meat--the texture and flavor of thoughtfully prepared steak, pork, or chicken. Here, the \"beef\" wasn't slices of grilled steak but little mysterious bits of ground beef floating in sauce. It was like eating trashy American food--if I wanted a sloppy joe, I'd go to a cheap diner. The chicken, on the hand, was dry and flavorless.

Second strike: canned salsas. Mexican food isn't particularly complicated, and its success rests on using fresh ingredients, particularly vegetables. My burrito was smothered in a canned-tasting sauce with little bits of canned of vegetables. If I wanted supermarket Mexican, I'd visit my mother (Mom: sorry, though I do love you).

Finally, the dishes are served with rice and salad....yes, salad...not beans. There is nothing better than the way that rice and beans mix together with each other and the other food on the plate. But this place isn't really Mexican food, so why would they even bother to provide beans?

In fairness, the food was edible but mediocre, but it's not Mexican."}
{"text":"Growing up in Southern California I tend to know good Mexican food when I taste it. Mariachis, is the best I've come across up here in good ol' Canada. From the decor to the menu everything is pretty authentic.  We started out with the queso fundido, a personal favorite of mine back home and boy it did not disappoint, melted cheese with chorizo and served with flour tortillas is a great way to start off your meal. For my entree I had the chicken fajitas, they were amazing served piping hot still on the skillet like they should be and all the fixin's on the side. And what Mexican meal isn't complete with out a Patron Margarita? Dinner for 2 including a shared appetizer and 2 patron margaritas came to $58 pretty reasonable considering all of the food we had. all in all this cozy neighbourhood spot satisfies the authentic cravings of home that I miss."}
{"text":"Mariachi's is one of my go-to restaurants. The staff are always so friendly, the drinks are delicious (we usually get a pitcher of sangria - pricey, but lots of booze!) and the food is fantastic.

Highly recommend the flautas as a starter - crispy, topped with the right amount of sour cream, cheese, tomatoes and guac. I usually get the pork tacos, which have the right amount of spice balanced out with pineapple. 

The hot sauce is homemade and amazing (very spicy). You can buy bottles of it to take home, which many of my friends do after having it for the first time."}
{"text":"The service is horrible.  We had one older woman, one younger woman and one gentleman serve us & he was the only one who spoke English. We ordered drinks and the appetizer right away. Once the app came we asked the younger woman if we could order the main but she didn't understand us. We ate the app waited about a 1/2 hour until we flagged the young woman down in the tiny place, to order the main. She then sends over the gentleman to take our order who was acting as the bartender. We then waited over 1/2 hour for our meal.  
Atmosphere and music resembles what I think Mexico would be like.  
Food is pretty good.  I had the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. The chicken was tender & juicy. The sangria was delicious.  We shared the appetizer plate. Flauta is good.  vegetarian quesadilla was my favourite because of the flat grill taste. Taquitos were alright. Guacamole is good but they only give you a couple of tablespoons.  
 I will not return because of the service."}
{"text":"10 years ago we use to come to this restaurant with our kids for family meals. Kids now grown and having been to many other Mexican eateries we ended up back here tonight. 
We were surprised and impressed by the nature and quality of the menu. The food was delicious, the chicken taco special with black beans and grilled vegetables was excellent. The beef and chorizo quesadillas were also excellent. 
The guacamole was fresh and tasty. 
The staff were genuinely friendly and interested in making our experience enjoyable. 
We will plan on returning much sooner!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mariachi's several times, with different groups of people, and always had a great time.

The interior is fun- bright colors and dim lights that are cozy during the cooler months of the year. The back patio is small but an enjoyable spot to enjoy a tasty margarita or daquiri during patio season, and there is also an outdoor seating area on Yonge street that's great for people watching on a nice day.

The food is tasty, authentic Mexican cuisine. I've especially enjoyed the chorizo burritos. The guacamole is also delicious and a good way to start a meal. Although I've seen others complain about the portions I have never left hungry- either they've fixed the problem with portions or I'm just not as hungry as others!

Service is great and the people are very friendly. However the service can be a bit slow sometimes- nothing I would ever complain about but perhaps not the perfect place to eat if you're in a big rush."}
{"text":"Nice food, very nice food. 
It was my first mexican restaurant (besides taco bell and burrito places) and man, I regretted all these years without Mexican food. 
Guacamole is a beauty! Pure creamy avocados without fillers like sour cream. Just with a zest of fresh lemon.
 I forgot what I had for main, but it was chicken cooked in a sauce that contains chocolate. I know it sounds weird but It isnt sugared chocolate, just pure kakao. It came with a scoop of rice, salad, black beans, and a soft Wrap.
I'll have to agree that, yes, their rice portion is small,and yes, their salad is quite tasteless. 
I also had a virgin piña colada, also beautiful, very fruity without that cheap slush-y syrupy tastes. Their dessert is the belle of the ball !! I've never had churros as good as this one. They make crunchy sounds with every bites and melt instantly in your tongue. Mmmmmmm ... Will def come back even just for the desserts.
Price was reasonable. The staffs are very friendly, I wish they paid a little more attention on the floor cuz I've had some hard time getting them to notice me calling them, but still friendly. Very nice people smiling all the time :) 
The atmosphere is good too, it is cozy with pretty stained glasses on windows and tables."}
{"text":"small and tacky inside, yet somehow charming -  but the most authentic tasty mexican food. not a huge selection on the menu though.
i'm waiting for an opportunity to go again."}
{"text":"Mariachi is a Mexican restaurant with a simple Mexican decor, dimmed lights, and a calm and casual atmosphere. They have a front and back patio, but I opted for the booths inside which I did regret because of the spider webs hanging over my head from the ceiling.

Mariachi's menu had Mexican seafood, meat and vegetarian options. I've tried the quesadilla tapatia ($10.95) and pollo poblano ($13.95). Both dishes were served with rice and salad. The food took a while to come and when it did come my table all agreed that the portions were tiny, especially the rice and salad. You get about three tablespoons of rice and a baby handful of tasteless salad. The main dish itself was good but nothing special. Also, it doesn't fill you up.

Desserts were really yummy but overpriced for what they were. I've had the churros and platanos machos- both $5.50 each and not that big in size. The churros were hot crispy pastry fingers with caramel and half a strawberry- really filling. The plantanos machos were cooked bananas with cream and honey and way too sweet and soggy.

The service here is friendly but very slow even though the restaurant was almost empty. Half way through our meal a sweet 11 year old boy took over and provided better service.

Overall, Mariachi's food is okay- it's nothing special and they could improve on their portions. Also the service is very slow which can put a downer to any dining experience. I also didn't find the restaurant too clean as I found dust around my table and spider webs on the walls. Personally, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"A staple of any Mexican restaurant is tortilla chips & salsa when you sit down.  After realizing they needed to be ordered, we were presented with a handful of cold & stale-ish chips ($1.75- though the menu stated there would only be a charge for an additional serving).  Then we had to ask for salsa, after which we were given a small ramekin of warm ranchero sauce. ?
My husband had the fajitas which were fresh & sizzling, but served with just a pinch of cheese,a tablespoon of thinned-out sour cream and a couple sprigs of wilted lettuce.
I had the enchiladas- the chorizo tasted like cinnamon (?), and the rice was about as bland as it comes.  
I can say with confidence that the staff is quite attentive, as all four servers came to our table at one point or another.  The servings are surprisingly small given the high price tag. I've never been hungry after leaving a Mexican restaurant.  I can only assume that the folks rating anything above 2-star have never had Mexican outside of Toronto :-("}
{"text":"I've been here five or so times and it was great every time. It's usually not super busy and the people working there are always nice. They also make some excellent Margarita's (and fairly well priced compared to other Y&E restaurants). I've ordered a few different dishes but their enchiladas are very delicious, especially with the poblano sauce. I usually get the churros for desert which are delicious. 

The only thing I would suggest to them is to update the restaurant appearance. The booths, table are chairs are quite old and really starting to show their age. It's definitely a casual restaurant but I wouldn't mind it to be just a bit classier. Overall though, excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a excellent choice for dinner great authentic Mexican cuisine,atmosphere was as I recalled from Tulum Mexico :) the sweetest waitress and waiter, and of course the traditional margarita an absolute must have! If your missing Mexico this is the place to go xoxo"}
{"text":"Walked into this cozy place on a cold winter evening. The ambiance was warm and welcoming. We were welcomed by a smiling server who seated us in a booth. Ordered the Queso Fundido for the table and a bunch of spicy enchiladas and tapas. The Cheesy Fundido was tasty indeed. For that price point, I expected it to serve 3 but it was barely enough for one. The enchiladas and tapas were delectable. Overall, tasty food but small portions."}
{"text":"Worst \"mexican\" restaurant I have ever been and the worst 20 bucks spent in my life. I am mexican and I was expecting something a little bit better, but what I got was the most horrible lunch in my whole life.

We ordered a Guacamole as an appetizer and it was clear that the \"Chef\" (If you may call it like that) is very cheap with the ingredients. It barely had tomato, cilantro an onions, hell, it barely had any taste at all.

Then I ordered the Chorizo Tacos, two super small, not mexican chorizo, tacos for 13 dollars. Are you kidding me? I felt I got robbed. Horrible taste, horrible tortillas, horrible chorizo, horrible service. And super expensive for what you get. 

This place is a no, no. Save yourself from a really bad experience."}
{"text":"Went there with my coworkers for lunch and it was good. The ambience of the place is cute with Mexican music playing in the background 

They had great service, polite and friendly staff which is always great! 

The guacamole was deliciously amazing. For the main course I ordered the taco special (beef), it wasn't too bad. I did ask for a side of sour cream and it tasted a little off, which I wasn't too happy about. I love my sour cream with tacos! 


The other thing that I wasn't too pleased with was the smell of the restaurant, it did smell a little funky. 

Overall, not bad for a small restaurant!"}
{"text":"A family-run gem in the heart of midtown! Mariachi's is the real deal when it comes to Mexican food -- not to slander any of the tens of mexican-hipster joints popping up all of the city, but they ain't got nothin' on these authentic mexican flavours!

Highly recommend their guac+chips, fajitas, tacos, and burritos... but I would imagine all the food to be great! Also try their Palomas -- awesome cocktail with grapefruit juice and tequila!

Expert tip: sit in the rear patio which is absolutely beautiful and tucked away from the business of Yonge street!"}
{"text":"Awful food. We were a group of 15, she handed us 2 bills and said we could wait 3-5 minutes while our sever finished her dinner if we wanted separate bills. She then told us we should have told her we wanted separate bills before dinner....

Awful service. Don't go here. We won't be back."}
{"text":"A restaurant first action of business should be to satisfy the patrons who go to their place, this particular restaurant needs a lot of soul searching before they can please their customers. I've ordered a la Tampiquena beef style plate which is overpriced at $21.95 or at least how they do it, the beef was fine however the rice in the plate was equal to the one contained on a espresso cup, the little salad was the most miserable serving I have ever experienced in an eatery, there were not tortillas with the orders ( come on..was this supposed to be a Mexican restaurant ?). My wife ordered a beef enchilada ($15.95) which were made with ground meat with taste very similar to the one used in meatballs sandwiches in any low price fast food, the guacamole which we ordered as an entry ($11.95) was for a pigmy size stomach and the hot sauce which had a familiar Ragu taste came along in a little ceramic cup so small that we barely could dip our tortillas chips in. A regrettable experience were good food was the missing factor  with a high price ransom ($ 58.10 plus taxes) for two. I think not everything is lost in this place but they need to work a lot harder to find the ability to please."}
{"text":"We went with my children to this restaurant and the service was good but the food was mediocre and heavily priced for the value. I ordered a cheese melt, and got more sausage than cheese and the cheese was cheddar (this dish is not done with cheddar). For $40 dollars per person without alcoholic beverages, one would expect so much more. It was 7 pm and the place was empty. Very disappointed. We won't go back!"}
{"text":"If you value atmosphere - this is the place for you!! The family atmosphere and decor really add to the experience. There is also a pretty outdoor patio for summer. 

The food is reasonably priced, tasty and quick! 

The drinks are amazing but pretty pricey.  They are, however,  really boozy and get the job done!  

You haven't lived until you have done a shot with queen Lupita! !

Great for dates or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"¡Estaba muy sabrosa!

A taste of Mexico at Yonge and Eglinton!

This cozy restaurant has been around for ages.
The decor is festive with bright colors and tables painted with geckos.

It's hard to find kid-friendly family spots in this part of town.

This restaurant is owned by Mexicans and their menu has a lot of Mexican favorites.

We started off with drinks and margaritas for the big kids.
Tasty, perfectly salty with enough punch.  I enjoyed mine!

The guacamole ($8) is fresh and served with toasty tortilla chips and mild hot sauce.  I don't think there was any garlic but the guac was creamy and tasty with chunks of onion and tomato.

The Plato de Tapas ($12) is an appetizer platter with an assortment of flautas, and quesadillas.  The Flautas  were my favorite item, deep fried corn tortillas stuffed with mashed potatoes. 

I had the seafood burrito and enchilada with rice and salad ($13).
The serving was huge, and everything was smothered in delicious green poblano sauce.  The seafood was fresh, firm, and not overcooked.  I was so full I started to just eat the burrito filling.  The rice wasn't bad, even though I'm not a huge fan of Mexican rice.

The fajitas were popular as expected.  You can get single servings or a serving for two.  The sizzling platter is huge but I didn't find the meat as tender as I would have liked.  The fajitas come with small servings of cheese, lettuce, and sour cream.  Additional sides (like tomatoes) are available at extra cost.

They have a selection of desserts here, churros, fried ice cream... we were too full for desert, but I wish I had room!

Overall, it was a nice meal and the service was good.  I don't eat Mexican food much, but this restaurant is one of the better Mexican restaurants I have tried in the city."}
{"text":"Low quality and over-priced, not a good combination. I ordered Cancun, which is supposed to be fish and seafood burrito combo, but they are filled with low quality bad tasting imitation crab meat stick you can get tons of those frozen from Costco, 1 piece of small shrimp on each burrito, no fish like the description on the menu. Very disappointed. One good thing about this place is an interesting interior. Missing Asada"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the margarita is 5 stars. I tried the fajitas, enchiladas, burritos and everything is pretty good but definitely the best part of every visit is a pitcher of margarita"}
{"text":"Mariachi's is a cozy little Mexican restaurant just south of Eglinton station. We can here for lunch and it didn't take long at all to get a table. The price-to-portion ratio is really good! So much food for less than $10! I got the Canadian Tire combo which had seafood (shrimp and crab) but I think next time, I would go for the beef. We also got guacamole and chips, which was good (but not amazing). Just a quick tip about the hot sauce - even though its not red, its really hot!"}
{"text":"Went here this afternoon for lunch with a friend who wanted to try it out. 

I like the inside of this place, its authentic and has a certain charm in a non corny way.

We sat in one of the booths and no sign of spider webs thankfully :)

My friend order a chicken dish with a sauce containing 40 ingredients. I wish I could tell you what it was called but if you go you will know which one. 

I ordered a shrimp dish with spicy chipotle sauce. 

The service was good and the food was explained well when asked for the waiter to recommend a dish

Food took a reasonable amount of time to come out but if you saw the kitchen with the one chef you would know why.

Now down to the food, both dishes tasted great BUT the portions were too small.

Therefore this place lost two stars simply because I walked out still hungry! 

No Bueno :(

A hungry Bobby is a sad Bobby"}
{"text":"My friend and I started going to Mariachi's once or twice a year over ten to fifteen years ago and the food was excellent, authentic and extremely flavourful. We loved this place.
I had lived in Mexico for three years so I was familiar with authentic Mexican cuisine. Then I think either the owners changed hands or the kids took over and the food changed because this old lady was no longer in the kitchen and an older man. So many times when you change the cooks, the food changes and the food was bland or over salted. Sometimes it tasted like it was missing something, some ingredient that should have been added. Unfortunately, I have not returned since."}
{"text":"\"I don't have to\" and \"you can't make me, phrases usually uttered by pettulant two year olds and rebellious teenager, imagine my surprise when order after order was met with phrases disturbingly similar to the aforementioned. Walking into this adult playpen I was greated with shockingly hopeful scents and a flirty outgoing waiter. I was shown to a table in the space of a few minutes and began to peruse the menu. After reading several of the reviews I was excited to try the Ensalada chela and the Molette. Shortly after my companions arrived the high hopes I had were dashed over and over. The waiter (now sullen and rude; why the change, not sure) announced that there was no guacamole or avacado left in the restaurant, effectively removing half of the menu. Really a mexican restaurant without guac, give me a break, regardless we soldired on. As we ordered dish after dish we were met with \"sorry we don't have that\" over and over. After going through three quarters of the menu our table settled on a few appetizers and entress. All of which were twice as expensive as originally planned, and instead of offering to make our stay more pleasant the sad waiter left abruptly after ordering and left us to fend for ourselves for over 35 minutes with NOTHING. If we were there closer to closing some of this bad behavior may have been forgiven, but bas it was only 830pm I think was hardly warranted. The fun apparently was only beginning, our meals came short of the promised additions of salsa tomatoes avacado and pico de gallo. When we were finally able to flag down the waiter he \"supposed\" he could gather up the missing ingredients. Hmming and hawing that everything was freshly made. I must impress that all of these misisng ingredients were in fact on the menu, not extras. Imagine my surprise when the missing ingredients showed up as additions on our bill. When we questioned the ever helpful waiter he promptly ( and I mean he had the second bill in his pocket) gave us an updated bill with out the last minute additions. There are so many ways that this restaurant could have gone from a 2 star to a 4 star, but they refused to be helpful or give any semblance of customer service. In fact the only thing that bumped this review from a 1 star to a 2 star was that the food we did receive tasted ok. Bottom line... I am thininking that customer service is a lost art and there are probably one or two other mexically friendly eateries that deserve my business, and taste just as good."}
{"text":"I love this place, great food and atmoshpere. Very reasonably priced, and good variety. Food is prepared very quickly, so good if your in a hurry. Friendly staff there as well. Margaritas are a good size. Hidden gem, for sure."}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends for dinner, drinks and chats... 
The people who own/run this place are adorable. They're not the quickest, but they certainly try! They love taking photos for you. A lot- we must have at least a dozen photos from different angles of us having a laugh. 
I didn't have one, but apparently the margaritas are awesome. Strawberry, an line are the most popular- but apparently the mango and guava are good too.
My friend and I ordered this:

Parillada- Our Mexican Ranch style platter feeds two with a variety of grilled meats
para dos - including steak, chorizo and chicken. On the side, we include a variety of sauces, refried beans, guacamole and corn tortillas,. This dish does need a
little more preparation time, but once it's served, you'll forget that there
was ever a wait! $37.95
 The steak was literally unedible- it was a large flat piece of fat. We gave it to one of the meat eaters at the table and he couldn't find any meat on it either. 
The chicken was delicious and lean. We didn't eat much of the chorizo. It came with a little chicken burrito and a little beef burrito. They were both delicious. 
The beans were yummy- and so was the rice. 
I wouldn't order it again- but I'd come back and try something else. It's a fun place and the people make it worth the visit."}
{"text":"Almost gave it two stars (read to find out more) but the one thing I can't get over is serving an alcoholic drink to someone who specified \"virgin\", when you delivered it to the table she checked again that it was \"virgin\", you agree verbally it had no alcohol, she tries some, tastes alcohol and then you go -- \"Oooh actually this one is the virgin\".  Sure, if she was pregnant or on medication or driving, maybe the sip of alcohol wouldn't be *that* big a deal.  But if she was recovering alcoholic, that one sip could literally change her life, and it's up to you as a business to be honest and knowledgeable about what you're serving.

Things that were terrible:
- we had a reservation, they called us to confirm it was for 700 pm, show up, they say oops we thought 730 pm, they literally have to move people from their seats to accommodate us
- during the 45 minute wait for all this to take place, they took drink orders from us multiple times, but never served us drinks
- they dropped an entire plate of steaming hot chicken fajitas on the ground, it splashed boiling sauce all over people, and their clothes as well
- when i went over to the owner at this point to say - now that we are covered in fajita sauce - can we please have the drinks we keep trying to order? she made a HUGE stink about it, just immediately responded, \"We didn't do any of this on purpose, do you understand? We are doing our best\" and then going to every member of my party reiterating that, as though I had done some rude injustice to her, it was super embarrassing and unprofessional
- drinks still took an extra hour and they weren't good
- they served the birthday girl fajitas with no tortillas or sides, just the meat (she didn't ask for that modification)
- the food was so awful my poor fiance actually sent his BACK -- and this is a guy who complains about NOTHING
- bills took over an hour after asking MULTIPLE times
- the place was so warm they had to keep opening the front door to let in cool air

It almost got 2 stars because they did pay the dry cleaning bill for the jacket that was covered in fajitas sauce, but honestly, I can't forgive the alcohol incident.  This whole experience was stressful and awful. I have no idea why they took our reservation (none of us had been there before), we were clearly too big a group for them at 700 (or 730..or 800...depends who you ask) on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"If you crave for some really good Mexican food, this is one of the best options in Toronto. Great food, their enchiladas are just awesome and they serve some great guacamole. It has a really good patio too that faces yonge street and they serve some specialty Mexican beer. Highly recommended for overall experience."}
{"text":"Friendly service, reasonable prices however chips and salsas should included like at every other Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican place on Eglinton. Nice staff, good quality food, reasonable price and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food there is amazing, and I'm a fan of this place now :)

The Guacamole and Corn Tortillas are the must to order!!!

Overall, the food is amazing there and I will definitely go back for another round."}
{"text":"First things first: Great service! They were so polite, friendly and for the most part fast 

The margaritas were fantastic! I will definitely be back for those! However, the food left my taste buds in complete disappointment!! The appetizer was alright- everything was bland for myself and my boyfriend. 

Entrees: my boyfriend ordered the beef enchiladas. They looked fantastic and I would know, I was looking at his meal for awhile.. I was kept waiting for my chicken enchiladas for about an additional 5-10 minutes after he got his. When it finally came, my rice was cold! Not to mention? I found a hair in it. I pretty much lost my appetite right there. But I was just too hungry in the end- so I ate around my nasty rice. Again, food was bland! For Mexican food, I expect bold flavours and spices... I got none of this. Not to mention, the \"spicy\" sauce was not even a hint of spice in there. 

I gave them three stars because they were über nice and the service was good. However, this is a Mexican place I won't be visiting again for the food."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Mariachi's on a Friday night sans reservation. This establishment is not a big one, but we were able to get seats without waiting too long. The hostess was quite friendly and seated us promptly, while exclaiming Spanish greetings. Clearly my level 1 Spanish course from Queen's was helpful as I had no idea what she was saying.

The menu is extensive with a variety of Mexican items that you can choose from. To start our dining experience, both my friend and I decided to order margaritas to celebrate the end of a tiring week. The drinks were served to us instantly, but I cannot say the same about the food. Once our drinks arrived, we were not ready to order food. The server said that she would be back soon. Somehow this 'soon' was synonomous for 'eternity.' We waited and waited, eyeing our server and her colleagues numerous times, but no one came to take our order. After twenty minutes, our server finally came to ask if we were ready to ourder our food.

The drinks were awesome... not too sweet, but not too 'alcoholy' (?). Our food was okay - it's not like I'm dreaming about the next time I can eat here again.

If someone invites me to Mariachi's, I wont object, but I feel that I've experienced better in Toronto. Take it or leave it, I say."}
{"text":"There aren't too many well-known Mexican restaurants in Toronto. At least not any I am aware of. So when I found out about Mariachi's, I was excited about going.  

This place is fairly small. There's a patio in the back. The inside is a little dark and dingy, but it feels authentic.  They give you a basket of nachos with salsa, which is quite delish. We ordered the veggie fajitas which were really surprisingly big. I think enough for two people, but I'm sure one person could finish them up. The servers were friendly, but they weren't that attentive, it wasn't even that busy the day we went."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for excellent authentic Mexican food with delicious margaritas at a very affordable price.  We have gone to this cozy, family run restaurant countless times over the years.  It's a hidden gem in the Yonge and Eglinton area where places tend to come and go and prices are often high.  This spot has stayed the test of time with enormous value and excellent food.  You must have the margaritas- they are excellent.  For food, it's hard for me to choose as I love their entire menu but if you are looking for something unique to traditional Mexican food I would suggest that their mole chicken is excellent.  I love everything and you can't go wrong.  One reason why I LOVE them is because I don't eat cilantro and they don't give me any grief about it being essential to Mexican cuisine, they just omit it for me.  It's a small place so be prepared for some wait time while they prepare your delicious meal to order - have a margarita - enjoy!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chorizo quesadilla (comes with a small amount of rice and pickled cabbage salad) had almost a cinnamon taste to it (roughly $15) Also the combo that came with a beef burrito and chimichanga (roughly $15). Also, I don't understand why they added a ton of large cubed potatoes and cubed carrots... The seats felt filthy (cloth seats felt dated and looks like they were not cleaned), waitress took forever to come, food was over priced for the portions given.  On a positive note, they nailed the whole Mexican ambiance, felt like I was in Cancun. 

Overall I probably wouldn't come back, they don't even provide complimentary chips with dip."}
{"text":"This is yummy Mexican food. Very filling & very satisfying. Portions are good. Service is pretty good (family run).  Very good Sangrias, fyi."}
{"text":"I am Mexican, this is a \"Mexican style\" restaurant, this is not a Mexican restaurant, the menu sounds really good, everything sounds very traditional and appealing, however once you try it it's less than average. 
I've been here a few times, I tried to give them a second and even a third chance, I thought that maybe if I ordered something g different I was going to like it, but no and on top of that  the dishes are extremely overpriced, I don't recommend it at all, if you want Mexican food go to el trompo and if you want a \"Mexican style\" restaurant go to Milagro, this one is also more chic and less casual than el trompo."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and they never disappoint.  I think it is owned by a family that works there and they are always smiling.  I have ordered all types of stuff and nothing has failed me yet.  Guacamole is a MUST here because they make it fresh and it is sooo creamy it tastes splendid.

Ask them their reco for Tequila and they are sure to make sure they choose what fits your style.  We were recommended the Jimador chilled and he was absolutely right it was amazing...so we had a few more lol"}
{"text":"It's hard to compare to the sangria served on the cobble-stone streets of Seville in Spain... but Mariachi's sangria comes close!! On a warm summer night, pull up a seat on their small outdoor patio and watch the world go by in the Yonge & Eglinton neighborhood. Soak up the alcohol with some homemade guacamole and nachos and pretend, for a moment, that you're somewhere more tropical! The main courses: burritos, tacos and fajitas are delicious and affordable. As far as Mexican food goes, this is some of the best our city has to offer."}
{"text":"Weird smell when we entered, not a lot of flavour and so so service. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"The place was awful!   The women's bathroom was so dirty and gross I couldn't use it.  I had to go upstairs, tell them and use the men's.  It was dinner time too.  If I can't use the bathroom at a restaurant I won't eat there.  The food was overpriced, subpar and service was not great.  Had much better Mexican food elsewhere.  Not vegetarian friendly either."}
{"text":"Great guac, tasty and filling entrees, yummy margaritas and sangria, front patio seating....not too shabby! I've eaten here a bunch of times and I've never been disappointed. True it's not as good as Frida (Eglinton west) or El Trompo (Kensington) or La Carnita (College St) but it's a solid choice for a Yonge-and-Eg Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Great vibe! My table of four ordered lime margaritas and beers, chips with guacamole, chorizo & chicken enchiladas and pork tacos for dinner and all were fabulous! For dessert we shared the fried ice cream and the churros (these were a little doughy then I've had in the past, but still good). It is a casual scene and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Their food is good, I love the sauces and the décor and the super-friendly staff.

My favourite are Chicken Taquitos. I have tried the Mole Sauce, I am not a fan. I have tried a few other things like Pablo Poblano, Fahitas, etc. but tend to order Taquitos more than anything else. When I want sit-down Mexican food, I go to Mariachi's.

Go if you want a cozy experience."}
{"text":"Food was decent. The place was smoky from the kitchen which was kind of distracting, but the servers were very nice."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I go there often because it's close to my office. There aren't any really amazing Mexican places in Toronto anyway. 

The guacamole is a bit bland, in my opinion. But it is pure and unadulterated. No fillers like mayo or sour cream, which ruin the texture. I add a little of the complimentary red sauce and I'm happy. The chips are great!

The servers don't all speak perfect English, so they've screwed up my order a few times. I love enchiladas, but one time they brought it in a creamy green sauce and I don't like cream sauce. Also, don't bother paying the extra $2 for white meat. Last time, the meat came burnt. It completely ruined the meal. I stopped ordering the enchiladas because they can never seem to get them right. I think $14 for a dark meat enchilada is very expensive (the prices are higher than the website suggests). 

The steak fajitas tasted great. But the meat is low quality and overcooked. Very chewy. Not tender. But the flavour is good if you're not a texture person. 

The shrimp and cactus is not a meal. The shrimp are very, very tiny. They were a bit overcooked (seems to be a theme). Once again, the flavor was great. Just wasn't much food and I was hoping for larger, perfectly cooked shrimp.

The drinks are SO EXPENSIVE! Watch out! A mango daiquiri is $7 (and I don't think there is as much alcohol as they claim) and they charge alcohol tax AFTER! Ends up being about $8.50 a drink plus tip. It's delicious, though. 

And yes, I am spoiled. I've been to Mexico twice and I've eaten real street food there. I've also had amazing Tex-mex by the Gulf in Florida. I have not found anything in Toronto that even comes close."}
{"text":"This is my Mexico in Toronto! 

Ever since I came back from my most memorable gastronomical adventures in Mexico 5 years ago, I have become a big fan of Mexican cuisine, its flavors, and tantalizing spices. From its chocolate chicken (mole) to my new favorite vegetable, nopales (cactus), Mexico has become one of my favorite destinations to visit. 

When not in Mexico, Mariachi is my Mexico. Specializing in authentic Mexican cuisine, I highly recommend their Mix platters for appetizers and meat and seafood combos. This way, you get the best of everything. 

Beverage wise, their Margaritas and Sangria's are not to be missed! Don't leave home without a shot of their house Tequila!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the presentation was awesome but I expected it to be more flavourful. 

The place is clearly family run and the service was great because of that. The lady who served me was super sweet."}
{"text":"I was hesitant about eating at Mariachi's because of the mixed Yelp reviews. However, I now regret holding out for so long.   Walking in, we were seated right away.  It's a very casual looking restaurant, but nicely decorated. 

We started with the guacamole appetizer, which was probably the best part of the meal.  A very generous portion and nicely presented. 

My \"Mole de Pollo\" was a dish of chicken in mole sauce, a small serving of rice, a dish of refried beans, and a green salad. My friend had a combo plate called East LA which had both a beef burrito and a chicken chimichanga, rice, and salad. 

Dessert was three (one order) hot and crispy churros served with tasty whipped cream. 

Our food was all fresh and tasty.  I did not experience any of the slow or inconsiderate service that others described. As a matter of fact, all three courses arrived very quickly and the two servers were very polite. And this was on a busy weekday evening during March Break. 

Shared appetizer, two meals, no drinks, and a shared dessert  - $50."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. We will go here from now on for awesome Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"It's pretty good Mexican food, and the atmosphere is cute. I sometimes come here for lunch when I am at work. Service is friendly and the food is decent. I've ordered the tacos, nachos and the churros. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Yey Mexican food! I am a big fan, so when a friend of mine suggested we go to a Mexican restaurant that made authentic Mexican food, I had no choice but to say YES! 

I loved it. The decor was cute and the people working there were super nice. Our table was very well taken care of at all times. 

The food itself was extremely satisfying. I tried pickled cactus. It was a first for me. It had that strange taste to it where you're not sure if you love it or not, but your body quickly gets used to the taste and soon wants it more. Kind of like olives. I also had the chicken fajitas with tons of guacamole and I stole a whole bunch of stuff from my friends (burritos, taquitos, enchiladas). All of it was mmmm.

I will return."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a whim after walking along Yonge between Davisville and Eglinton. The staff was friendly and relaxed. We decided to sit on the patio, which can get very noisy at times from the busy street. However, the people watching could be worth the noise. We ordered the veggie fajitas and Cancun meal, which included a seafood burrito and seafood enchilada with rice and salad. I was a little disappointed with the seafood dishes because the filling consisted mostly of surimi. I believe the dish would have been better off using only shrimp or a flakey white fish. The sauce was really delicious and creamy, but the quality of the filling brings the rest of it down. The veggie fajitas were decent, but there were not enough tortillas to eat the entirely amount of fillings. I find it annoying when that happens, like not having enough bread to mop up the bottom of a yummy soup. I would definitely think twice before returning again, but there were a couple of dishes that perked my interest including a shrimp and cactus appetizer."}
{"text":"Great margaritas!  Homemade Quacamole - YUM!

Family run, authentic Mexican restaurant just south of Young & Eg. 

Decent food selection and unique sharing platters. Only gave it 3 stars because the quality of the food has varied from visit to visit. Some times its excellent and sometimes its just ok. Its never been bad however, which is why I  still go back time and time again."}
{"text":"Their home-made habanero hot sauce is AMAZING. I believe they sell it...but call ahead, as they often run out and re-stock weekly. 

Staff are friendly, and accommodated my friend's keto-diet (happy to switch rice out for salad) . Food was yummy, great place to bring friends and family to relax and get a good bite :)"}
{"text":"After having visited a number of mexican restaurants in Toronto, i was baffled at how few good mexican restaurants Toronto really has.  

I can't even recall the number of times that i got up from a $20-$30 dinner from a nice mexican restaurant and thought about hitting up taco bell to quench that thirst for the perfect mexican meal.  Over time, i have learnt that what i was looking for was more of a tex-mex restaurant, kinda like sneaky dees which is amazing for those types of foods.  

When it comes to actual mexican food though, i think Mariachi's is the real deal.  You start with a very satisfying guacamole dip that will leave you questioning whether or not you even want to order an entree or scrap that idea and replace it with a stomach ache full of guac!  Four of us went and each tried something different off of the dinner menu, after sampling everyone's food i was shocked to see that all of the food was actually really good.  Also noteworthy is the hot sauce.  Only available upon request, but coming from a pakistani/indian...its spicey...and its good spicey!  Not frank's spicey, but the kind that goes really well wtih mexican food.  

With a live mariachi band, a nice patio, and a delightful drink menu, this restaurant makes for a very nice date place.  Fair prices (under $20), good tasting food with quality ingredients.  Portions were fair and there was nothing but happy faces in this establishment!  A great addition to the Yonge and Eglington area and finally a sit-down mexican restaurant worthy of taking your family or date to."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food. Great food every time I go with fantastic service. Definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants in Toronto! Well done!"}
{"text":"Was at Mariachis on Saturday night for dinner and I left a happy camper! It is a family run establishment; sweetest ladies ever!

Its not fancy and pretentious, very laid back vibe, decor that is typical of mexican restaurants and they have a live band playing. The waitresses laugh and joke with patrons and give great recommendations for food and drinks. Test out your Spanish skills with them, they love it!

We waited a tad long for our food but the staff apologized a few times and checked in so we didn't really notice.

All in all a great experience, I definitely suggest making reservations!"}
{"text":"From the outside, you'd never know that such a nice, authentic Mexican experience awaits you inside this unpretentious little joint situated roughly halfway between Eglinton and Davisville subway stations on Yonge Street.

Upon entering, we were greeted with a warm smile and were told we could seat ourselves - which we did, in a cozy booth, surrounded by Mexican decoration on the walls and even the tabletops.  So far so good - and the delicious aromas emanating from the kitchen plus tasteful Mexican music added to the great first impression this place creates.  Anticipation for the meal was running high by this point.

Service was prompt, efficient and very friendly - we had drinks and chips with guacamole within 5 minutes of sitting down.  The guacamole, by the way, was deliciously buttery and arrived in a mortar and pestle - extra bonus points for the nice presentation.

The menu selections were well thought out, clearly explained and un-fancy - which is exactly right for this kind of place.  We weren't looking for some pretentious chef's interpretation of Mexican - we wanted actual Mexican food!

Ordered the Mole de Pollo - which came quickly if simply presented (but again, not complaining - nice and simple does it when the food tastes this good).  The portion size, while initially looking a bit small, turned out to be exactly right: the chicken came with a small salad, refried beans and - the only knock against this place - some Uncle Bens-ish looking rice.  Still, the combination of flavours was great, so really, thumbs up.

The bill was maybe a tiny bit expensive (dinner for 2 with 2 soft drinks & 1 beer was $53), but the place reminded me so fondly of my time exploring Mexico (the non-touristy parts) that I didn't mind forking over the dough.

You know when you sit down to dine somewhere new and everything goes so right that you know as soon as you get home you're going to Yelp the shit out of that place because you want everyone to know how awesome it was?  Well, I just got home from Mariachi's and here I am.  And I can't wait to go back.

PS There's TWO patios - one out front on Yonge and a secret one in back..."}
{"text":"I was at \"El Mariachis\" this evening for dinner with a friend and it was both our first time eating there even though it's located in my friend's neighborhood. The atmosphere was pleasant but I didn't feel like I was in a real mexican restaurant. Besides having the name of the items on the menu in Spanish and the staff being Hispanic, I still felt like there was something missing in the whole \"Mexican\" experience.

I had a veal steak with rice,beans and a side salad. I was surprise at how small the rice portion was because it was the size of an ice cream scoop and I didn't have enough to mix with my black beans. The side salad was okay but the highlight of the meal was the veal steak which I really enjoyed but it's unfortunate that it was the only thing that I liked on my meal.

I would defintely come back to this place because it's a great place to bring a date or or to catch up with friends but I might have to ask for extra portion of the side dishes because I was still hungry when I left the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant's cozy ambiance and service is always friendly. Orders may come in slow but that's a good sign, meaning they make fresh food and don't just heat up stuff in the microwave. Not to be missed is the guacamole, which is served in an interesting stone bowl. If you're really nice to your server, you might be offered free refill of tortilla chips! Enchiladas are decent, but I don't like the burritos. And for dessert, fried ice cream is quite a treat! One thing though, Mariachi's is pretty expensive for the size of their food portions."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Mariachi's since they started 12 years ago.  The Franchise restaurants have their place. but there is nothing like a Restaurant Run by family who take great pride in what they are making and serving. I have always found them to be very friendly, helpful, 12 years ago I found their meals to be genuine compared to most of what was available at the time. 

Tonight I went back for my birthday, and thought it was about time I wrote a review on my Favorite Mexican restaurant in Toronto. We all had something different. I love the sizzling Mariachi's Fajitas,  I prefer the mix of beef and chicken , done just right.  I have had the Carne a la Michoacana  Grilled strips of sirloin finished with a tequila and ranchera sauce. Very good! Very casual and relaxed evening, with great service, they brought out the sombrero and sang happy birthday at the end of the evening. The others with our party had never been, and were very happy to find a real Mexican resturant, that is not another chain, and were happy to have found a new place to eat.."}
{"text":"It's rare that I give 1 star for a restaurant.
Thats how bad it was.
Food tasted awful, overpriced, Sangria tasted like juice with barely any alcohol or fruits, and didnt feel the restaurant was clean.
Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went to Mariachi's based on previous Yelp reviews.  I had the \"East L.A.,\" which is a chicken chimichanga and beef burrito entree, with guacamole as an appetizer.  

I found the guacomole to be a little bland, and the chicken dry.  The beef burrito had good flavor.  

Overall, the service was very prompt, and our meals were served promptly, and for $12 the entree was worth it."}
{"text":"Mariachi's is like a mini fiesta. That's the restaurant's tagline and it couldn't be more accurate. After being turned away by a string of inexplicably-closed-on-Sunday Italian restaurants in the Yonge Street strip between Davisville and Eglinton I stumbled upon Mariachi's, as authentic a Mexican restaurant I'd ever seen in the city that was packed with families young and old. 

Many things on the menu tempted me. Hominy cooked in seasoned chicken broth. Ensalada \"Chela\" (named after the chef), a green salad brimming with tomatoes, avocado, seasonal fruit and \"special\" dressing.
Molletes (Mexican bruschetta), with black beans, pico de gallo and cheese.

Think of every tortilla/bean/cheese combo that ends in \"A\" and it's on this menu. Flautas, taquizas, enchiladas, quesadillas, fajitas and more. Once again, you can take a glance at the restaurant's website for a look at the menu and a bit of a giggle - the site's set in Comic Sans, complete with clipart waving Mexican flags and a menu that can be downloaded in WORD. Not PDF my friends - MS Word. But web design isn't the specialty here - mothereffing genius Mexican food is. 

We started with a silky lime-infused guacamole, pico de gallo and chips that was hailed as \"sweet as a stolen kiss.\" It was devoured within minutes. I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas - two corn tortillas stuffed with black beans, mushrooms, red and green peppers and covered in creamy poblano chile sauce and cheese, baked and topped with sour cream. 

This place screamed \"Mexico!\" from the moment I walked in - from the authentic decor, Mexican artwork on the walls, music playing on the stereo and Hispanic servers. I can't wait to return and try the famed sangria and some of the other menu items I was lemming but didn't select."}
{"text":"Very nice neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  Staff are very friendly (we were served by a young Mexican girl student) and the food was outstanding. Even my Venezuelan girlfriend was impressed!
We will go back there for sure."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Mexican and had always walked or drove by this location. We decided to finally give it a shot and were not disappointed. 

The location is small but has a authentic feel about that stands or among other local restaurants. We had a guacamole, chips and a few tacos for an appetizer and both had great flavour and came pretty quick to our table. The chips for the guacamole were still warm. 

We had a few main courses. Fajitas were a stand out with a zesty tomato sauce as the base. 

Over all great experience, large portions and classic authentic Mexican feel. We will absolutely go back!"}
