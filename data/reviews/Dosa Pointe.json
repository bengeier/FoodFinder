{"text":"I had visited this restaurant along with my friends for dinner on this weekend. Several of my friends had visited this restaurant and said the food was great and it's really famous for its Dosa's. We went there for the dinner and by the time we reached there, it was already bustling with guests. We were told, we never get served, since it's gonna close by 10:00 pm and there were 10-12 people before us. My friend persuaded the kind owner and he let us in after half n hour. We were served within 10 minutes we gave the order for the food. Each one of us had different dosa. I tried the Chettinad Paneer Dosa. It was an Indian crispy pancake served with grated cottage cheese and spices. It was really delicious. We ordered the lamb Biryani. The meat was tender and properly cooked with the right amount of spices.  The owner was cool and made sure we were served. We had a little chat with him about the food in the menu. He did mention that he had taken the food inspiration from different parts of southern India and added it to the menu. We finished our meal with large amount of food in our bellies and to give it a satisfying end , we had finished it with desserts. We had a good experience here and I definitely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Nourriture du sud de l'Inde.  Restauration local de parc Extension, clientèle majoritairement indienne. Spécialité dans les dosas, crêpes fines indiennes. Service lent dû à la préparation. La nourriture est excellente et plein de saveurs."}
{"text":"On what planet can you get a 6$ masala dosa? At Dosa Pointe, that's where!  Their food is delicious and consistent. I've eaten here several times and they maintain their quality.  The owner is often there, and he is one of those jolly Indian uncles from the Bollywood movies. A thorough gentleman who takes the time to get to know his clients. He'll talk to you and ask about your life like a real restauranteur.  The paradox of Dosa Pointe is that you'll get a superior dosa, and pay less for it than the competition.  Go figure."}
{"text":"Couple of my friends raved about this place for the longest time. My sister and I were in the neighborhood, so we decided to have our lunch there.   The restaurant is very simple. Few tables and chairs. The owner was our server, very helpful, despite not asking for it. He goes through the details of the food. I can see he is very passionate and knowledgeable about the food. When I saw the menu, I got overwhelmed to see the extensive of list of the menu. I asked our server to help us to choose one. My little sister chose a spicy chicken dosa. The server kept asking her if she is sure of her order because it's spicy. It was getting annoying.   Finally, we got our dosas! Omg... it was absolutely a delish! It made us forget the annoying server. Especially, the spicy chicken dosas was the best!  All I would say, to be patient with the owner's talking, do go there for the most delicious dosas."}
{"text":"I think I would give 3.5 stars. The owner was super nice answering our questions about the menu. Simple decor, small dining room. The biryani was really tasty. We also ordered a green tamarind dosa and vadas as appetizers, which were both nicely flavored. A very nice discovery!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find! Though it shouldn't be considered that I suppose since it's right there in 'Little India,' but for someone who grew up eating South Indian (Kerala) cooking and who finds most of what's offered up as Indian food in Montreal not quite up to par, to put it mildly, this place is indeed a find. Sanjay the owner met me warmly and remained a consummate host throughout my dining experience. He and his family are from Hyderabad and they do all of the cooking themselves. At lunch today, his wife was running the kitchen. Hyderabadi dishes are quite renowned for their brilliant flavours and innovative mix of Northern, Southern, and Middle Eastern cuisines. Although the menu looks rather typical now of \"South Indian\" food outside South India (dosas and idlis) he says they are gradually introducing the full range of Hyderabadi dishes in the form of daily specials. (He had a funny story of how when they went to print the original menu which listed basically everything they knew how to cook; the printer laughed at them and told them what they had was not a menu it was a book!) Okay to the food: all fresh and delicious. First, I had a bowl of rasam to warm up my bones. It was rich and spicy and sour all at once. Hit the spot. That was followed by a plate of vadas, which are basically yummy savoury lentil donuts (!), served with sambar and two kinds of chutneys. The coconut chutney has the Hyderabadi \"extra\" touch, which is to mix in a peanut paste. Then of course I had to try the good old standard masala dosa: perfect. The filling could probably be a little spicier but then this is the basic dosa from which there are a million permutations, which I think included spicier versions.   Dosa Pointe is a true gem, anyone who likes Indian food should go right out and try it (or maybe you shouldn't; I would hate to stand in a line in this cold!). I can't wait to go back and try one of their biryanis!"}
{"text":"Delicious food & fair prices. They were also very nice and helped us find the vegan options.  As their name suggests, amazing Dosa, highly suggest!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best dosa I've ever had.  Both my chicken keema dosa and my girlfriend's mysore masala dosa were outstanding.  The chutneys were fantastic as well.  My girlfriend even said it's just as good as the dosa she's had many times in India!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, but after walking in for the second time in my first day, I was treated like a lower than worthy guest, seemingly for embarassing the owner in front of the better guests. I apologize for accidentally turning off one light, for one second, but if it's a repeated thing perhaps your advisory shouting across the restaurant could Begin with 'the light is inside!' VS (don't turn off the light...).  Was looking forward to coming back many times for the quality eats, but can't be drawn toward terrible treats. Did I not tip to standard? Change the options?   That was pure humiliation!! I'd have brought 10 guests back, but should they be white so you can return a pearly ^ smile like when we walked in this morning with delight, I'd hope you'd might. Second time in a day guests returning alone might get second to best in way of  lighter skinned folks at rest.   POINTE sur cette place, à parts des dosas:Tournes tes mots sur leur dos:améliorez vos traitements des gens, peu importe nos races, même si FRANGINS. Peut être je ne vais plus sentir attaqué pour la semblance de mon sac à-dos..? so'dat I can feel comfortable to come back... White, blue, or black or brown in this supposedly diverse town...!"}
{"text":"The owner was extremely rude to us on multiple occassions.   When I first arrived at the restaurant, I wasn't so sure about the menu. The owner was very curt , irritable and rude about making suggestions when asked. However, one overlooked it and I quietly ate my meal.  Having forgotten the incident I visited a second time. Again, he was extremely rude to our group ( three students) as a person just arrive 2 minutes after we did while we placed our order. He stated, that it would be very difficult to take an additional order if placed ours and the late person decided to place his later. Afterwards, we barely finished our meal and the lady picked my plate, he approached our table and told us to hurriedly get up as \"another group is waiting\". I'm sure he did not have dared to that to a large family group or a non-Indian crowd.   The disaster are strictly okay, I can make better ones at home. The logistics of this place are a mess.   And I from Bombay, where they run fast paced Dosa joints at a lightening pace and efficiency, bit never have I been told to get up and leave ever.   Not one to create a commotion, I quietly left the place, but definitely no tips and not coming here again!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy family business run by extremely nice people and the food is delicious!  I'm not sure that I've been to another place with such a wide variety of dosas. I highly recommend the chettinad dosas, the vindaloo dosas, and the red onion uttapam. The flavour profile of these dosas is very different from a lot of the dosas I've tried at different places. I'm looking forward to trying the gongura and the achari style next visit. The idli and the vada look very enticing."}
{"text":"4th time here now. The dosas and Biryanis are amazing highly recommended the lamb Biryani and the Mysore Masala type of dosas. Also be sure to grab a lassi for some great times!!!"}
{"text":"Owner is very friendly. This place has large varieties of dosa and accompanied condiments are good too. Must try their (spicy) chicken biryani."}
{"text":"My favorite place for south indian food. The prices are great, food authentic and fresh. I do not miss being in India when I am here. The variety for dosas is huge. And I would recommend trying their rasam instead of sambhar when you irder idli or vada. I also love the spring rolls here. Best value for money a place can offer with customized and attentive service."}
{"text":"Ordered Sambar-Idly and Dosa to-go.  The quality/taste of both and the cutney was awesome.  Given a chance, would go again."}
{"text":"We waited outside for 20 minutes because it was a very tiny place and then they took our orders after 15 minutes, and on top of that they came to tell us their sambar was not ready at the last minute, so we wasted an over half an hour to tell us to leave."}
{"text":"Honestly it's a shame.. the food is great is but the service is just terrible.. we ordered apps and main course right away as we knew the menu well.. the table next to us which sat down 10 min after received their appetizers and main course before us... 35 mins later I ask the waitress that I would like the apps to come before the main order... she said they are busy and should be shortly ready, I asked her to please make sure the apps are fresh... 46 mins later she brought cold appetizers not even considering the fact our order was nowhere near ready and we didn't even get a follow up... 1 hr later I had to approached the waitress a second time, she said they're busy... another table sits down, receives main course.. still no dosas for us... such a shame.... been here a few times and same experience every time, if ever you are hungry I suggest you so you this place as you'll be disappointed... defo not returning"}
{"text":"I don't know much about south Indian food but went there because of a friend and was delighted by the food. First I had a spicy lamb dosa which was amazing, freshly cooked and crispy with pieces of lamp inside. Liked it so much that ordered after that the lamb biryani, it was nice but perhaps it's not for everybody and had too much lamb at that point, lol. Overall we were really satisfied at the end and really full for a great price. The place is ok, not  much decor and kinda small, but the service is nice. They don't accept credit cards."}
