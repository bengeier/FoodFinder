{"text":"World famous and likely most forgotten, old style Montreal Deli with the best smoked meat sandwich, corned beef and cabbage and cheesecake I have ever eaten. Miss it dearly!"}
{"text":"GONE! I think Pierre Trudeau (if that is his real name) hasn't been to Montreal in a while.  Ben's ceased being legendary or second to Schwartz's more than a decade ago. The restaurant's slow decline (food became worse and worse, restaurant dirtier and filthier) culminated in a worker strike over a year ago (protesting conditions as much as salaries), a pretext with which the widow who owned the restaurant used to close the place so she could sell the building (now slated for demolition to make way for a new office tower). I guess back in the day it was something but even the first time I ate there in 1999, it was a pale shadow of what it was."}
{"text":"Second in the world of smoked meat sandwich delis only to Schwartz, Ben's is another legendary Montreal institution for which websites like Yelp exist. During the summer I spent at McGill, I came here way too often for my own good and would've gained 80 pounds if it weren't for the fact that I walked and rollerbladed everywhere in this most awesome of awesome cities."}
