{"text":"A new gem in the Yonge and Eglinton area. If you have a diverse palate, you will love Kabul Kebob. The prices are very reasonable , staff are friendly and nice, they play lovely Middle Eastern music, and most importantly the food is delicious. I ordered the Sultani Kebob, comprising of 2 skewers of beef chunks and minced beef , well seasoned , very tender and soft, especially the skewer of beef chunks . The dish is served with a choice of white rice or Barberry rice or lentil rice accompanied with charcoaled tomatoes and a bowl of salad. Definitely add sumac to your meat , to make the meat even more tender and a bit zesty :-) (Sumac being a great meat dish spice used for balancing the strong flavor of meat in middle eastern Kebobs) . don't expect a fancy restaurant, this place is a hole in the wall with a great menu. The other dishes such as the white or dark chicken kabobs and shawarma are good choices too :-)"}
{"text":"Very delicious! Generous portions and low priced. Great place for a casual lunch or for getting take out.  I always get the chicken kebab plate which comes with a choice of saffron barberry rice OR a dill lentil rice. I usually get the first but they will allow you to mix as well. It's absolutely delicious. The chicken is so fresh and tender, the most tender I've ever had. It's seasoned perfectly too. You also get a side salad and they will give you tabouli, pink pickled turnip, hummus and all the other delicious veggies if you ask for them. I've also had the falafel which is good. I would like to try the beef too. The hot sauce is homemade and so tasty! The service is very friendly and it seems that the owner is always there. The staff seems to be Persian and this place truly is authentic!"}
{"text":"Yummy shwarma! Went in a little after 11 to a woman at the counter who didn't know what the lunch special was... then a man helped me who said the chicken maybe wasn't ready. After he took the temperature he allowed me to have a chicken shwarma. Lots of menu options including kabobs and vegetarian options. Tasty! Very 90's style inside, but with plenty of tables and chairs."}
{"text":"Glad to have found this place! Food tastes good. The set up is like a fast food place. You can see what they have and order. I got ground beef kebab combo. Came with 2 skewers, choice of rice, grilled tomato, and salad.  They are tasty, though the saffron rice a bit dry, maybe for sitting there for a while. Service is friendly and fast. Great addition to Yonge and Eglington area."}
{"text":"I've never given a rating so low before. I decided to check out this place on my lunch break because it's so close to my work. Man do I ever regret it. I decided to try something simple so I ordered a chicken shawarma... 1. Pale pickled turnips- When the lady was filling my shawarma I noticed the pickled turnips were extremely pale. I've had my fair share of middle Eastern food and never have I ever seen turnips that were so pale but I gave it the benefit of a doubt.  2. The pita- it's not your usual larger thin pita, it's a smaller and much thicker version which I've seen at places and can be very good if heated/toasted a little. This place didn't do either.  3. TASTED LIKE FISH- i was two bites into my shawarma and it tasted like fish, I spat it out so quickly! What a waste of $7.50.   It's really too bad this place didn't work out, I was looking forward to having a good and close by shawarma spot.  The only positive - staff are really nice and the place looks clean."}
{"text":"Service - beyond amazing! The service deserves 6 stars.   Food - it's ok. I'd give food 3 stars.   I've had a chicken shawarma here a year or two ago. Since then, I never came back. The pita was meh. It was somewhat bland. I actually feel the same way about the beef plate that I got. It's filling, portion is good. Taste was meh. Will I go back here again? Maybe...maybe not.   The guy who served was very nice. My meal came up to $10.16 and he just took my $10. I asked for rice that is apparently extra charge, which I didn't know, but he gave it to me anyways. He said it's normally extra. It was really nice of him.   I'd probably check out their lunch special. It's $5.99, but I'm not sure what it is. Though, I feel like Villa Medina in the food court is better."}
{"text":"I hardly ever come to Yonge and Eligible, but I had a doctor's appointment near this restaurant.  Huge and enormous portions.  Rice pilau/pilaf cooked nicely - grains were separate - sign that someone in the kitchen knows how to cook!  Chicken korma was exceptional - but a little on the oily side.  (I don't cook with much oil and taste it when I eat out).  Service was ok.  The food, in a nutshell, is tasty.  However, I am familiar with this food and can only suggest that they please RAMP UP YOUR SEASONINGS.  Please don't adjust them - keep things original, i.e. a little more spicing, please!  I did taste the cinnamon and it was good -- add some more of the other (original) spicing and I'll rate this place a 5-star.  Lots of potential in this nice little restaurant."}
