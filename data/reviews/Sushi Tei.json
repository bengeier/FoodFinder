{"text":"My first time here. I came because I saw it on yelp. We ordered the spider roll and the salmon sashimi it was ok a best. The dipping sauce for our shrimp tempura look like it was already used. 

The salmon sashimi not the best grade. Our servers took awhile as well to check on us. I will not be coming back here. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I came here awhile ago and had their Sashimi Boats as well as their Bibimbaps.  The quantity and quality of the food here is absolutely bomb.com.  You must try the Double Dynamite roll, sooooo good.  Crispy and very fresh tasting, not soggy or oily at all.  INCREDIBLE spot for their pork bone soup!!!  Over the past few months ive turned into a pork bone soup connoisseur, trying out different spots.  Sushi Tei hands down surpasses them all; alot of meat and the broth is very tasty and spicy. 
Always good times coming here, and I will return again very soon!!!  Cheers everyone!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Arrogant host.  You come here only because the choices in Mississauga is pitiful.  Pitiful because there isn't a sushi place run by Japanese chefs in Mississauga so us real sushi lovers have to put up with average quality sushi."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the price and quality of the sushi. The staff were very nice and I cannot vouch for the Korean food, but, sadly, this is not a good place for sushi."}
{"text":"I visited Sushi Tei last Friday night and thought the atmosphere is nice, the service is okay, but the food wasn't as great as I had hoped. (We come here maybe once a year...and now I remember why.)

We ordered a kimchi with pork belly dinner and chirashi sushi. The kimchi with pork belly dinner came in less than 5 minutes. It was a busy Friday night -- I figured they had probably pre-cooked the pork belly, so all they had to do after we placed the order was to stir fry it a bit more with some kimchi... But there was really no sign of pork \"belly\" and I could count with my fingers the number of slices of pork that went into the dish. I was unimpressed...

The presentation of the chirashi sushi is nice and I liked the touch of sesame, seaweed and tobiko on the sushi rice. However, the fish did not taste very fresh. For the price I had paid, I immediately thought of the fish I had at Fune in Toronto. Fune is ever so slightly more expensive, but the fish was a lot more fresh and the slices were thick. It's unfortunate that we don't have very many choices in the area, unless you're willing to drive all the way to downtown or uptown for fresh sushi if you're looking for a non-AYCE restaurant.

The complimentary soup, salad and ice cream is not bad...but that's not enough to bring me back here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times but the service last time really disappointed me cuz I was wait in the counter for check out and the waitress just stood in front of me chatting, and I was waiting for like 5 mins for check out while there's no one in line and they are chatting. Pretty rude that was, and the food is only okay level with not really a worth price, prob going to sushi 168 next time"}
{"text":"The food here should always get 5 stars -- very fast service, and very good food! 
You should know that they recently raised their prices $ 1 or $ 2 PER entree. 
I think that I would have given this place a 5 star review, however, because of one particular server (perhaps the owner's sister) who almost always looks like she is in a bad mood, we will have to take one star off. Otherwise, the other servers are always fantastic, and very quick!"}
{"text":"Sushi Tei gets my vote as having the best ikura--and best sushi-- I've ever had to date: fresh, not too salty, with the roe crisp and delicate in flavour, the perfect mix of soft brine and creaminess that keeps me coming back visit after visit. Complimentary miso soup, edamame, kimchi and spicy fried tofu are a customary part of the dining experience, as is excellent overall service. Note: this place gets very busy Friday and Saturday nights, so if you're starving, or going to dining in a group, save yourself the line-up and make reservations. 
      Parents: Spacious and private booths allow for families to eat comfortably, making this place a great spot to eat out if you've got two or more kids in tow. Also, the booths make for a great undisturbed dining experience, ideal for a date or intimate dinner. 
     Love Korean food and sushi? You're in luck: this place is Korean owned, so expect to find a wide variety of standard Korean dishes. 
      A regular for over 5 years, I've been treated by the chef team extremely well: extra ikura, salmon sashimi, hand rolls and beautifully prepared unexpected treats \"appear\" on my plate every time I go, courtesy of chef Tony and sous-chef Justin. These guys know how to treat a customer, hands down. The waitresses greet me by name, and are forever refilling my green tea. I've brought friends, co-workers and my boyfriend to this place and the vote is unanimous: this is fresh, high-quality sushi and great service.
     Fans of spicy tuna and salmon, uni, ikura and big rolls will not be disappointed. Tell Tony that Ikura Girl says hi and that he's the best..."}
{"text":"This place goes as average Japanese restaurants go. Not bad or amazing. 

I know the start of this review sounds somewhat negative, but on the contrary, the service was good and the food filled me up and I have no complaints about it. It just didn't put that \"wow\" factor unlike other restaurants have. 

So overall, definitely a casual place to eat and a very clean calming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi..! Especially their spicy salmon/spicy tuna. Very different spicy sauce is used.. (not spicy mayo). Very friendly wait staff and will always try to accommodate your needs. Green tea ice cream is also amazing here!

My favourite sushi place in the GTA for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent place for sushi but nothing close to being 4 stars.  Service is always quick and attentive.  I occasionally come here with friends who insist this is the best place in Mississauga only to be disappointed time and time again."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I first began eating sushi years ago.  I've found their fish quality to be mediocre in the last year.  The last time I went, my husband and I ordered two different dishes - sashmi for me and some sort of tuna roll for him.  Needless to say we were sick shortly after."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's our go-to friday night place, but only if we can get in early enough.

The service is friendly and quick, the food is always consistently good and served quickly. They always greet you as though you're their best friends, it's such a nice feeling. The atmosphere is great, the music is hilariously cheesy but it's such a warm place."}
{"text":"Amazing Korean and Japanese food.  Everyone is correct in saying the service is the icing on the cake, everyone is very friendly :)  One order at our table came with soup, I ordered a matching soup for myself and the server brought it for me on the house.   The sushi presentation was amazing, I ordered a party tray for an event that weekend!"}
{"text":"Good food. Always returning. 

Everything on their menu is delicious and their staff is really nice !
The only thing I don't like from their menu is the spicy salmon sushi! It tastes funky :3

The restaurant is in a good area too since it is near BR ;) YES ! Win-Win."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in our neighbourhood and our regular go-to for take-out and sit-down dinner. The restaurant is routinely packed, mostly with east asian clientele. Their semi-private booths are a nice touch that is similar to the types of private rooms you can get in restaurants in Japan, although admittedly without the same elegance. They are fast, reliable and tasty. The tempura is good but not excellent. Our son has allergies to fish and they are generally good about cleaning all of their knives and cutting boards before making his avacado rolls, which is very much appreciated. Overall, a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Before new management took over a few years ago, this was one of my favourite Japanese restaurant in Mississauga. I still appreciate the decor, ambience and service, however the food is really lacking. The sushi portions are not filling or mouth-watering at all. I miss the old Sushi Tei!"}
{"text":"This place has decent food. But the waitresses there are extremely racist and sexist. 

I went there with my friend who is Korean, they would only speak with him. I would ask them questions and for them to explain in English, and the waitress only nodded to me, looked away and continued to speak in Korean. I even had to explain to her that I'm a customer too.

I was very upset with their service overall. I've never left so invisible in my life until I came to Sushi Tei. If you want to be treated with disrespect, and be discriminated - Sushi Tei is the place to be."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. They forgot my order completely, when I asked them when it was coming, they kept saying soon. I waited an hour for 18 pieces of sushi. The rest of my table had finished, so I got up to find my waiter and told her to cancel my order. I was pissed, but polite and calm. 

The waitress then argued with me saying it would come out soon. My table is finished! They are all ready to go, I'm not waiting for my food, so they can watch me eat. After a lot of fuss and arguing, did she finally cancel it. 

They offered nothing to apologize and I walked out starving. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Has been one of my favourite sushi restaurants in Mississauga for a very long time. Ban chan to start your meal and they offer green tea ice cream at the end. 
Consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried the Yuk Gae Jang, spicy fish soup, and we also shared the dragon roll as an appetizer, just to try something from the Japanese menu. My friend's Yuk Gae Jang looked great and she loved it. When I ordered the spicy fish soup, the girl asked me if I was sure, twice. The soup wasn't as spicy as I expected, so I wonder if they gave me the vanilla version since my friend's YGJ was a lot spicier. It was still good though, no complaints. I'm docking a star, however, because of the lack of banchan... and even more so, because of the lack of kimchi. How do you serve Korean food without kimchi?"}
{"text":"I've been here many times but after my last visit I'm never coming here again. The server was extremely rude and the sushi rolls were poorly made. I'd suggest to skip out on this place and just go to AYCE."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi spot! Food is great. Love the private seating areas. I love that they play either Japanese or Korean music. I have never had anything here that I did not love. My husband and I usually get the course birdie meal. Very yummy! Completely recommend! !!"}
{"text":"Good reliable sushi place, the little rooms are very nice. Staff is great and service is stunning. Better reserve it gets busy sometimes."}
{"text":"Sushi tei has a really nice intimate atmosphere. The sushi was pretty decent, I've had better, but I really enjoyed the Korean food. I would recommend then place to anyone, I'd most likely cone here again."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place in general all around as soon as you walk in greeted by all staff and very fast service. Is great for a very quick lunch and taste is exceptionally good.

You can sit in one of many private seating areas which I think is cool."}
{"text":"I only had a couple of sushi rolls (red dragon and golden dragon) and they were awful..the worst sushi..the roll pieces were oversized, too much rice on them, and no flavor..pretty disappointed"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the GTA.

I am slightly confused as to the YELP-ers that recieved mediocre service here- I have been going here for years, and I have never received anything but the best service!

There is rarely a long wait- the best seats are in the small rooms with the curtains, if you have a medium sized party.

I have never eaten anything that wasn't good here, and I have tried a fair few things. Consistently excellent service & food.

Meals come included with everything- dessert as well! (Delicious green tea ice cream.)

I would come back to Mississauga just for this place! A+ from me."}
{"text":"Came here for a take out dinner on sat evening. 

Tried the white fish sashimi - YUMMMMM
California rolls - fresh but had fish eggs mixed in ..
edemame - they stuffed the little container with it..I thought it was sweet. 
Calamari maki rolls - this was amazing. It was my first time trying it and it was delicious. The calamari had been cooked and dipped into some sort of a bbq- sweet sauce. The texture was perfect. Try it!!
spicy tuna maki roll - very delicious. It was a tad more spicy than regular but still went pretty well with soy :)

The take out was so fast.
I finished paying and the chef heard me ordering and started to make the maki roll's right away. AWESOME!

{"text":"Came to Sushi Tei on a Monday night. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a cold breeze. Only 2 waitresses working the entire restaurant. Our table area was freezing so I asked for a warmer area on the main dining floor. The banchan was terrible. Fishcakes were over cooked, kimchi was warm, egg casserole was watery and inedible. Reminds me of Holiday Inn breakfast buffet eggs. 

The porkbone soup kamjatang did not come out hot or bubbling. I took a bite of soup and it was warm. I had to send it back to get it reheated. 

Food quality and service here is absolutely garbage. I will never return to Sushi tei.

$70 after tax and tip for 3 people."}
{"text":"This place has the best pork bone soup I've found yet.  Once it came only slightly warm to the table, and even then it was so good I couldn't complain.  I'm sorry I find their yuk gae jang too salty, because it would otherwise also be as excellent.  I love their grilled mackerel as well."}
{"text":"This place has cool decor and you may even get a private room to dine in! The free sides include fish cake which i love. Food is grear and i highly recommend the karaage, seafood pancake, beef sashimi, bulgogi, and any of the korean stews. For dinner, they give complimentary green tea ice cream. Service is always great. The only thing is that the quality of sushi is inconsistent. Highly recommend for othee dishes though!"}
{"text":"Writing an update as I have now tried dinner at Sushi Tei, and again, the quality and service is still quite solid. I came here in a large party on two occasions and the service was very good - we were always given free small dishes and sometimes appetizers on the house. 

I recommend getting sashimi boats and order some side specialty sushi rolls if you come in a large party. The fish is fresh and the rolls are quite tasty. If you order a large boat and split amongst friends, the cost goes down per person instead of ordering a single bento box entree. I always order spicy salmon roll here - I love the way they do it! The green onion touch is so refreshing, light and yummy!

Definitely a solid pick if you're craving sushi/sashimi but want good quality and non-all you can eat."}
{"text":"Decent size place, plenty of seats.  Miso soup was good. Salad dressing was only so so. Sushi was okay. We've had better, and there are so many options in Mississauga. We did take out, service was fast and staff were nice."}
{"text":"I stand by my previous rating regarding their sushi quality, which has definitely gone down the drain. My friend ordered the Sakura lunch special, and the fish in her meal was as hard, dense, and plasticky as ever. That being said, the special was a good value for its price point of $13.95, as it included a big bowl of udon, three nigiri, two dynamite rolls, 6 pieces of sashimi, and 5 pieces of assorted tempura - in addition to salmon.

My rating this time, however, reflects the quality of the beef sashimi bibimbap that I ordered and the service that I received today. The waitresses were quite attentive for the most part, and very good with answering my questions about the raw beef bibimbap. They had pleasant smiles on their face the whole time. When my bill came out at the end with an incorrect amount (we had asked them to split the bill, and although the bill was split, the final cumulative total was not and it appeared on my part of the bill), the waitress apologized and was very sincere and nice about it.

It was my first time trying the beef sashimi bibimbap. I was initially surprised that it didn't arrive in a dolsot (hot piping stone bowl), but instead, in two separate bowls with the hot rice separate. I was, however, pleased by the fact that it came with a healthy dousing of vegetables (almost half)! I mixed the egg with the beef and veggies, then added the hot sauce and ate it with the rice. It was very flavourful, but beware of the spicy pieces of raw garlic! My meal also came with miso soup and a salad, so that was also the pleasant surprise! 

Next time I come, I am definitely ordering the Korean food instead as its quality seems to be more superior than the Japanese food."}
{"text":"This was my go-to for sushi place before I found Hinote. Compared to them, Tei's sushi rolls are too small for my liking (which I guess is the typical sushi size everywhere. Hinote's rolls are above average) 

The restaurant has nice decor, fun small japanese huts for more private dining, and seats a lot of diners. The waitresses, cooks, and hosts are also very friendly. Most, if not all, immediately greet you as you enter the restaurant. You feel at home and very welcomed. My bf and I joke around and often call it \"Bob's Place\", making it seem like we know the owner himself. We actually met him one time as he was walking around table to table asking people if they enjoyed their meal. Nice man. His name isn't Bob.

Prices are a bit more expensive than compared to other sushi joints, but the quality and service makes up for this. Regardless of what you order, they always have on-the-house apps, usually 6 of them, that are offered while you look over the menu, alongside with tea. These include edamame, fish cake, bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, some fish dish, kimchi, etc. It sometimes changes. Also, last time I went, although it didn't come at first, my dad mentioned how he loved this fried fish he had before. The waitress immediately whipped us up an order- also on the house. The fish was huge! Definitely entree portion. I live for the fish cakes, bean sprouts, and edamame.Even more so that it's free. The fact that other jap restos typically charge you per app, I find it this a nice treat. Another reason why people often come back.

LOVE the sashimi. I always endulge and get 8 piece to myself. I believe its about $11+ for that. A little pricey, but the cut and grade of the salmon is worth it. I'll sometimes get 3-piece if I get a large entre. Whenever I get the actual dish, it always comes with 4 pieces though. YAY! haha. I joke around about this too, saying that it's because I'm pretty that the waitress decides to give me more. One time, however, I made the slip of saying \"4 piece sashimi\" instead of 3. Sad to say, that time, they gave me 3 pieces. followed by a, \"I guess you're not pretty today\" from my bf. LOL. This rarely happens though. The occasional time it does, my boyfriend makes sure to let me know how unattractive I am that day. haha. anyways...

Their Korean food is AWESOME! Great selection. Super Delish. Kalbi, Bulgogi, Spicy Bulgogi, Fried Yaki Udon are my favs. Love, love, love their yaki udon. Such good sauce, huge portion, and I loveee all the seafood in it. Have seen pork bone soup, udon soup, etc. Haven't eaten them myself, but people rave of them.

If you want delicious Jap and Korean food, I highly recommend this resto.

*Cheers*"}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place! It's always packed around dinner time. 

I usually get korean food but the sushi is great too. I like the sashimi donburi the best. 

It was my friend's birthday a few weeks ago and they made her a sushi cake. That was delish too but we were all super full afterwards to really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Sushi is great, we normally take out and have for large family gatherings. They are fast and on time for our pick up. Definitely a go to spot."}
{"text":"My go to sushi spot in Mississauga. 
It's nice casual and quiet.. Service is nice quick and friendly. 

The menu is easy to read and has a lot of variety. It's a good spot to go for quality fish. Meals come with 3 sides a miso soup and salad. The spicy fish cakes are the best, I always get two. I usually get anything sushi/sashimi or the bibimbap. I recommend the seafood bibimbap. Also did I mention free desserts! 

What you get for the price is definitely worth it. Domestic beer goes for 4.95, and meals vary around 10-18$. One seafood bibimbap is 14.95$ and will fill you up.

Overall, this is one of my favorite sushi restaurant. Good quality food. Good quantity for what you pay."}
{"text":"I recently ordered takeout from here. I got the SPICY YAKI IKA for $14.95 which is stir fried squid and vegetables with hot sauce. Its under the korean portion of their menu. While waiting, the waitress bought us some green tea. Very nice touch.

So spicy squid dish was crazzzyyyy tasty. The portion was huge and the sauce was sooooo good ... you'll love it if you are a fan of gochojang. Aaand it came with rice, salad, soup and two side dishes (kimchi and something else) ... so a lot of food for $15.

Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Food quality.  Sushi was good, not amazing, but good.  Some types of fish tasted older and frozen.  

- The decor is nicer than a lot of Japanese restaurants in Mississauga.

- Freebies. They give you some super cheap freebies on the house.  A nice touch that might get customers to come back.  It did for me, once.


Cons:

I booked a reservation for one of their booths.  Upon arrival I didn't get one.  Whatever.
It took about 15 minutes after we all sat down for a server to come and bring us menus or drinks. Another 15 minutes go by and I had to grab one of the waitresses to ask to order.  The recurring theme of the night is that I had to keep getting up to ask waitresses passing by to get service.  

What really got me mad was how my table got food.  Four of us ordered and the first person got their food 30+ minutes before the last person got their food.  This is not All You Can Eat people.. This is a nicer sit-down restaurant and the prices reflect that, so you'd expect everyone to get their meals at the same time like how every other restaurant in the world does. 

At some point (after asking 3 separate waitresses where our food was) the manager came by and said the last plate didn't get there because they accidentally gave it to another table.  No apology, just the simple explanation.  We randomly got handed our bills before I could get up and complain about the service, and of course there was no discount offered.  Furthermore, we had to ask for drink refills multiple times.  The waitresses never smiled and seemed bothered at any of our \"requests\" which shouldn't have happened in the first place - things like drink re-fills should be automatic.  I regrettably tipped them too, idiot move.

To be completely honest, it was the worst service I've ever received in a restaurant in my entire life.  I will not be coming back ever again.  It was embarrassing to recommend the place to my friends and have their meal ruined."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with some friends; I regret not trying this place out sooner.  They have a wide assortment of Japanese and Korean dishes to choose from and the portions are huge.  (at least during dinner).  The prices are average for a non-AYCE sushi place, but I'd say the portions make up for it.

The restaurant itself is clean and has nice ambiance.  You and your party can sit in booths to give yourselves some privacy.

I don't generally frequent non-AYCE sushi joints, but I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"The deep fried California Rolls, Calamarie rolls and Spider Rolls were awesome!!
 
The service was very homely and comforting.

 I would definitely go back for round 2 at the Sushi Tei!!

The best part, the total bill for 3 people game upto $70"}
{"text":"Sushi Tei is one of those restaurants that you can trust to be fail-safe.   Conveniently located near Square One and Celebration Square, it's a good spot for mall-rats and festival-goers to grab some grub.  In fact, my friends  and I went here after the Japan Canada Festival 2017.  The first thing you will notice when you arrive is the \"traditional\" decor with its wooden booths and paintings of geishas.  We enjoyed the clean interior and spaciousness, but, other than the decor and the polite service, nothing else blew us away.

The food here is decent; it's good, but it doesn't have a \"wow factor\" to it.  The portions were average, but the prices were a few dollars  above average.  The price to quality ratio was a concern as well.  We ordered the chirashi bowl, unagi donburi, sukiyaki, angry tiger, takoyaki, and donkatsu.  Here were our thoughts:

- donkatsu - my bf, who is a self-proclaimed donkatsu aficionado, said it was one of the best donkatsu dishes he has ever tried in the GTA and surrounding areas.

- angry tiger roll - it was bland, dry, and the size was too large to eat without difficulty.

- unagi donburi - my friend said he would rate it 6/10 because it was decent in flavour and size, but the price was too hefty for what he received.

- sukiyaki - the broth was flavourful, but it was too sweet for some and there was only a small portion of meat.

- takoyaki - it looked very-well plated, but it was 3/4 the size of takoyaki that you could find elsewhere

- side dishes - unlike other Korean-run restaurants, you only receive two side dishes (tofu skins and bean sprouts)

Overall, we didn't dislike the food.  It just wasn't impressionable.  We would still recommend others to give it a go because they had a constant traffic of customers, which is a good sign of well-received food by the general public."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi and my boyfriend brought me here. I loved the interior of the restaurant, so beautiful. They started us off with miso soup and some side dishes (edamame, fish cakes (amazing!) and bean sprouts). We ordered the vegetable spring rolls, the double crispy dynamite roll, spicy salmon roll, volcano roll (the best one!) And the deep fried California roll. They all were good but my boyfriend and I loved the volcano roll the best. At the end of the meal they also served us green tea ice cream.  

We usually go to all you can eat sushi places so this was a nice change. Service was good but the staff rarely came to check up on us. I hope my boyfriend takes me here again! I really want to try some of the Korean dishes.

*4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while. Food was average but good size portions. Service was mixed. Some staff were good, others were extremely rude. When the check came, girl took mobile payment machine out of my friend's hand, threw his card on the table and walked away even though we gave 15% tips.  No thank you/usual greetings. Since we tend to recall the first & last things, all that I will remember is the last imagine. It will be a very long time before returning again."}
{"text":"This place, and Hinote sushi are the only decent places for non AYCE sushi.  

Good assortment of food and nice ambiance. The little booths with dividers are cute and great for an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"My all time favourite sushi place.  Been going here for years! I choose this place over any fine dining Japanese resto in the GTA.  Excellent food, service, clean, and casual atmosphere.  The only disadvantage is, its not a AYCE and there is no teppanyaki."}
{"text":"In my top 5 for Korean and Japanese food. Always amazing, top notch quality, good service."}
{"text":"Sushi Tei is just one of those places that my family always comes back to because of its great quality and options for Korean and Japanese food. The price is pretty average for this type of restaurant but it's not really on the \"cheap\" side. The appetizers are always plentiful and delicious- they never skimp out on the kimchi. 

I've tried a wide variety of items of their menu and I have never been disappointed. Bibimbap, sushi dinner, sushi boat, kalbi, kimchi stew, udon soup, chicken teriyaki bento box.. They are all great. The sizes could be a bit bigger but if you're ordering the dinner sushi boxes, those will fill you up! 

The waiters sometimes need to be reminded of things to bring you (water, forks or extra tea) but they are good at checking in sometimes. Depends on which waiter you get. 

It's always clean here and it's great for kids (not too loud, they have enclosed eating areas so they aren't bugging the people next to you). 

I come back here all the time!"}
{"text":"Sushi Tei is my go-to place when I want sushi a la carte. What keeps me coming back to Sushi Tei is their lunch specials. In addition to a fixed lunch special menu, there are also two daily special features - the Ume Special at $7 and Sakura Special at $14. The Sakura special that I had today included a big bowl of udon, 4 pieces of tempura (2 shrimp pieces and 2 veggie pieces), and a big platter of sushi (6 sashimi pieces, 4 nigiri, and 2 dynamite rolls). For $14, this is extremely worth it as the tempura udon by itself would have been $13. The quality of the sashimi wasn't the best but that was expected because of the price point. The Ume special was salmon teriyaki meal, with two pieces of tofu tempura as the appetizer, a miso soup, and a side salad. I believe these two dishes are the Wednesday special. 

I usually find their service to be pretty good as the waitresses are attentive. For example, despite my arrival being 15 minutes before my friend's, the waitress still remembered which booth I was in and was able to guide my friend to our booth. However, I was disappointed today as I felt that they were rushing us. My friend finished her meal before me, so her bowl was taken away, and then we were asked if we wanted separate bills or one bill while I was only halfway through my meal. It was also clear that I was still working on my meal as I still had sushi pieces left on the plate. It was a Wednesday afternoon, and the restaurant wasn't packed, so I'm not sure why they would rush us. I don't recall this happening during my previous visits to Sushi Tei, so maybe it was just an off-day.

Overall, I'd recommend coming here for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Sushi Tei has been opened for many years and is well-known in the city for fresh fish. The price is slightly higher than a lot of the sushi restaurants around. The menu has a good selection from a la carte to dinner course to korean dishes. Food is good... but I am not so happy about the customer service. They are always low on staff and every time it'll take me 5-10 minutes to get seated, even though there were a lot of empty tables everywhere. That's fine. Today the waiters and waitresses were busy doing their own thing and no one looked up to check if customers are waiting at the entrance. It took them 10 mins for someone to come to us. It is definitely not a welcoming place. The waitresses never smiles and every time I come it feels like I am begging for them to fill up more green tea for us or to get us more chopsticks and plates. Overall, food is good but customer service is terrible and there are better places around in Mississauga for sushi."}
{"text":"Have been to sushi tei several times over the years and it has been consistently good. There is more traditional Japanese dishes you do not find at most Japanese restaurants nowadays. The food is yummy, the service is friendly and my friend knows the owner and staff there which is nice when they give him recognition for being a regular there. We all got free green tea ice-cream even though not everyone ordered a meal.

The also have the really cute booths with curtains instead of doors which I like, but it is sometimes hard to wave a server down because of this. they should have bells or red lights like some korean restaurants do.

The only sour point is the price :s they are a bit more then other Japanese ala carte. 2 pieces of sushi ranges form 3.95-7.95 :s and 18.95 was the cheapest dinner bento box. Nowadays when there are so many Japanese ayce with really good sushi it is hard to justify paying $20 w/o tax/tip for chicken teriyaki, 5 pieces of sushi and tempura.

I know they also have a franchise in Thornhill but I have never been to that one."}
{"text":"Sushi Tei is Korean owned but the food here is still very good. Can't choose whether to eat Korean food, Japanese food or both? This is a good place to come to then! 

I was pleasantly surprised to get the beansprout and the spicy fish cake (Korean) side dishes which were the perfect start to the meal in addition to the soup and salad. They were quite simple but were a good addition. 

The spice salmon handroll was full of actual spicy salmon with NO breadcrumbs/tempura bits which is a pleasant change from many sushi restaurants. 

The rice in the charashi was very flavorful with sufficient sweetness. The sashimi was quite average but was still quite tasty. I wouldn't say I was blown away by their quality here but it certainly did the trick for satisfying my sushi fix. 

And last the meal was finished off with green tea ice cream which came with the meal, a nice gesture!

I did really like the booths they have here which contribute to an extra level of coziness. There's also plenty of seats and tables available which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Came here recently with my family and ordered the 72pc sashimi and sukiyaki. The servers were really nice, however service was a bit slower. They didn't forget what we asked for, just took long. The sashimi boat came out not long after ordering as it should be but the sukiyaki took so long to come, even after we finished the sashimi we waited another 10 minutes for it. 

A few pluses were that they gave us miso soup on the house and I think they even gave us a few more pieces of sashimi! Comes with free green tea ice cream as dessert :)"}
{"text":"I will keep this review plain and simple.  No Japanese poods for me.  I went to ST for Korean Poods.  Korean Soup to be more precise.  I have tried many a Yuk Gae Jang (Spicy beef soup) in my life and have to admit that ST's rocked my boat!  Packed full of Beef, Veg, Noodles, and Spicy goodness.  Delicious!  Service was fast and efficient.  Plenty of parking.  North West corner of Burnhamthorpe and Creditview. 
Peace!"}
{"text":"Yesterday , I went to there ate lunch with my family, sometimes we go there feel not to bad. But this time I found there something change was about payment , they change the machine you must choose one  of  the tip on 15%' 20% and 25%. we knew normally gave 15% is  befor tax, but they set after tax, and they didn't mind service is good or bad you all need pay less 15% tip . Unfortunately they service change bad , let me felt not good, if they service still good , I will pay, but they didn\"t keep high quality, and also to force customer pay high tip after tax total amount...."}
{"text":"I trust this place for takeouts because they're probably one of the very few that don't cheat ya.

Staff is polite and organized. Prices vary depending on hungry you feel at that moment. I'd say it's about average.

Fish and rice is always fresh, I know this because they haven't already turned to stone when I touch them. 

This restaurant is very neatly & traditionally decorated.  Seating areas are available to guests in private rooms where no noises can't be heard from the outside. Good for dates, business deals, or peace & quiet for those who need to recharge their chè.

10/10 guys. Well done."}
{"text":"I don't come very often anymore on account of the fact that I live a little further away and that I'm a vegetarian (which severely limits my sushi options). That being said, I will still endorse it as the best sushi place in Mississauga...perhaps not the most notable of achievements, but I think it's worth something!

If you're looking for AYCE, I suggest you go elsewhere because it's strictly a-la-carte, something I have no problem with. Sure, it's a little more of a strain on the wallet but I was never a huge fan of the all you can eat, even back when I did eat fish. I don't mind paying a bit more for what I really want. 

The quality has always been high, the décor quite pleasant and the service impeccable. They're efficient and expedient (as is usually the case with sushi restaurants) but without being the least bit pushy. Plus I don't think that there has been one time that I've gone where they haven't offered my party something on the house. It's a nice touch. 

I must confess that I do sometimes miss the Hamachi (always my favorite), but I guess it's my own fault for being one of those daft vegetarians! Still, highly recommended and pretty excellent for a sushi place out in the 'burbs."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese/Korean restaurant in Mississauga area. Services are great.  You can get tons of side dishes for free. Food are served fast as well. 

Only drawback is that they have been keeping increasing the price. I can remember that a few years ago, a  Sashimi dinner was around $18, now  is $25 with less piece of Sashimi"}
{"text":"I want to give a higher rating for the atmosphere and friendly, attentive service. But the food was just okay.

Ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box. Tempura was good. Salad was fine. Chicken was dry, drowned in sauce and lying atop a bed of sad-looking sprouts and zucchini. The sushi wasn't the freshest.

It was just okay."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi not really fresh, the place is nice. The service is good. We had lunch special, the prices is not good value compare to what you get, it should be more fresh and more meat on it."}
{"text":"It's not great, not bad, I'd say about average in terms of sushi taste and price. Comparatively speaking I prefer Dai Ichi and Hinote But this place is close to my house. Their lunch specials are a better deal. I e always had pretty good service here but if I was basing it strictly on taste and if you're going for a non AYCE, may wanna give the other two places a shot"}
{"text":"This place has the best bibim bop around!  Worth the trip to Mississauga -- I go to this place almost every week.

The sushi's good too, and in true Korean form you'll get free little side dishes.  Attentive and friendly staff.  Lots of private booths."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Came here for lunch today: has sushi, sashimi, maki, tempura, udon, kalbi... Not all by myself of course! 

The kalbi was too chewy for my liking, by the seasoning was great. The maki was delicious. The tempura was soggy. The udon was alright. The thing that disappointed me the most was the sushi and sashimi. I hear people raving about how fresh it is here: I beg to differ. The salmon was quite fresh, but the tuna and the white fish was very noticibly not as fresh. 

The service was impeccable! The servers were lovely and kind and they made the experience really nice. It's unfortunate that the food wasn't as great."}
{"text":"Sushi & sashimi are good but dun order the miso ramen......is disastrous  service was very slow, I asked 3 times for an extra bowl until it arrives, that's probably another reason why the ramen was extremely soggy lol"}
{"text":"(1) California Maki - not good. they dont break up the imitation crab meat and just leave it in a chunk -- one of my biggest pet peeves when ordering california rolls!

(2) Salmon Maki - pretty good sized pieces of salmon 

(3) Spicy Tofu Soup - decent

I dont really know how this restaurant compares to other japanese restaurants in the area. Being from Vancouver (awesomeee sushi), this place was bad. I probably wouldnt eat here again."}
{"text":"A little confusing that their website says they have AYCE and a la carte when it's actually only a la carte.

Awesome quality fish, great service. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Went here for a pretty casual Friday night meal with my fiancé and when we walked in the place was packed, always a good sign.

We started by looking over the menu. Not a huge selection, but enough for us to pick some sushi and sashimi favourites. The service was extremely quick and we were waited on almost immediately even though they were busy.

We ordered a couple of beers as well as spicy tuna, rainbow maki, calamari roll and tuna sashimi. After ordering we were brought a bunch of complimentary items, miso, edemame, etc which was really nice!

The food was great, not excellent (still my favorite sushi is Fork and Spoon in Oakville) but it was quite a nice casual Friday dinner.

I would definitely recommend it for the food, but definitely for the friendly service and speed. We will go back again I'm sure."}
{"text":"Decent food with good service. Ambiance is great and spacious. Pricing is also decent. For the amount you pay, this place is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Double Crispy Dynamite rolls has tempora  shrimp on top and in the roll, very big and tasty.

Bibimbab was sizzling hot, veggies were fresh and not overcooked. 

There were two of us sharing one serving of each and we def left full!  Our meals came with complimentary miso soup and small appetizer salad dishes to start.  The meal was finished off with complimentary green tea ice cream.

We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Sushi Tei has been renamed Sushi Tomo.  We were very surprised after coming here over 20 years.  Prices are higher and portions are less.  No more Kimchi and the boats have eliminated shrimp and hamachi.  Still good but way less value.  3 stars since I loved Sushi Tei's value.  Wondering was this a change of ownership?"}
{"text":"It's a la carte and it shows it in the quality of food. But more importantly, the service is the most attentive, and some of the best you will get at a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, not quite a \"fan\", but this place is decent for what it is, a non-AYCE sushi/Korean restaurant that offers quick service, and good value (sides are always included and some kinda dessert - whether that's fresh slice of orange/green tea ice cream).

Sushi Tei also offers Lunch Specials until 3pm, even on weekends, so that's definitely an incentive for people who don't want to eat fast food, but are on-the-go!

While service isn't the definition of pleasant, it is efficient.  Your tea/water will be refilled on a regular basis and there are a few waitresses who service the dining room.  So it isn't difficult to flag someone down.

I really like the banchans like sprouts, slices of pressed bean curd, edamame, and soup/salad, so again, another incentive to go back."}
{"text":"ya, this place has a monopoly in mississauga.  There isn't much choice to choose from unless you're willing to be inconvenienced.  the fish is NOT fresh, back in the days, eons ago, yes it was.  but i've been back once or twice over the years, and each time i regret coming here.  the price does not match the quality.  chewy, unfresh fish is what you'll end up with. the complimentary appetizers, soup, salad and ice cream are not bad and give it an average thumbs up. rolls are average as well. 

decor 5/5 (i like the wooden booths)
service 3/5 (waitress somewhat unprofessional, but i guess quick to serve, ask how things are etc.)
food 2.5/5 relative to price
price 2/5"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE coming to this restaurant about 10 years ago, but their management changed multiple times over the past 7 years and each change has made the restaurant one step worse. This recent time had me not wanting to return anymore.

Food wise, it was alright. We ordered the medium platter of sashimi, a stone-pot bibimbap, and donburi. The taste and portion were average, but they have raised $1 more on each item since the last time I went. However, they were ridiculously STINGY in their Banchan. I understand that people take advantage of the banchan and kept asking for refills since it is free of charge, but on the first go, 5 pieces of those spicy fish slices and a spoonful of beansprouts just do not cut it. When we asked for refills, they gave us even less. I brushed it off since it was \"free\". 

The service was what I had problems with. I was half way through the bibimbap and was taking a break from eating, with my utensils down and talking with my family when one of the waiters came over and asked whether I was finished with my meal. I was surprised she asked because it was obvious that I was not. It was 9pm at that time and I thought maybe they had wanted us out since the restaurant might be closing. In fact I saw all their waiters cleaning up already at that time. So I brushed it off. 

Whenever we finished one dish, whether small or big, they would ask to take it immediately. It is great if you feel like the dishes are in the customers' way, but I felt SUPER RUSHED as if they wanted us out. We asked for more green tea, and they didn't want to give it to us. We quickly finished our meal and they immediately gave us the ice cream and the bill. At this time, it was 9:20pm. Literally 2 minutes later, the waitress came over with the credit machine and made us pay. WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE CHANCE TO GO OVER THE BILL. I immediately got angry and asked the waitress what time they closed and she said 10:30pm!! So I asked her, \"are you guys in a rush?\" It seems like you're all rushing us out!! She was shocked that I asked her and said that they are not in a rush. The credit card machine also had a lot of problems!!!  

Sorry, I don't take rude service. I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Always one of my favourite sushi places in Mississauga. The atmosphere is authentic and the food is excellent.  The service is fantastic. The restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Sushi tei never disappoints. I've been coming here consistently for years and have never had any negative experience. All the servers and staff greet you as you walk in (sometimes yelling from the kitchen). The sushi comes out fast and tastes delicious and fresh. I definitely suggest you try their mushroom butter yaki or their huge sashimi boat!"}
{"text":"Love this place. 
The waiters are friendly, service is good
The fish is really fresh. My family always comes here to get sashimi."}
{"text":"Why does this place still exist? This place has the worst sushi ever! I'm not sure about the other food but if your called sushi tei then you should definitely get the sushi right."}
{"text":"I work across the street so we come here for lunch often. Good sushi and prices are fair. Everyone who works here is really nice and service is pretty fast, even during lunch rush."}
{"text":"Fave sushi place is Mississauga. Blows Hinote out of the water any day. I don't know what the people who like Hinote are even thinking. 
I have probably eaten at Sushi Tei 100 times since I stared eating sushi lol. They have my favourite spicy tuna roll ever!!!!! Had their sashimi & sushi party tray yesterday for lunch with a friend and she was impressed. I will be back soon... Love you Sushi Tei!!!!

I just want to say that I just go back from picking up takeout from Sushi Tei. Just walking in and smelling the delicious food made me happy. Can't wait to dig in :)"}
{"text":"This place gets a 4 or 5.  

The service is great, always fast, pleasant, and efficient.  The food is great, and they offer both Japanese and Korean food.  The food quality is one of the best Japanese I've had, but not THE best.  They have private tables available.  

The prices are fair as well, and if you're looking to spend just a little, you can get by here.  

I recommend this place for groups, family, and couples.

{"text":"I think that this is the place to get the best sushi in Mississauga.  It's fresh and the service is fast.  I have gone here many times and I am always trying new things but today, I went in for lunch with my husband and we decided that we were only going to have maki rolls.  They have this new menu with a variety of maki roll.  We ordered Ocean's Roll (wrapped in a thin slice of cucumber instead of sushi and rice, with salmon, crab, red snapper), Deep Fried California Roll (the staple dipped in tempura batter and deep fried) and Hawaiian Roll (with Salmon, avocado, payaya and mango).  My favorite was the Deep Fried California Roll, it's so different and delicious.

There are many more items so the menu that are good, too many to mention but the choices are endless and it gives you the opportunity to try something new each time to go."}
{"text":"*Definitely* had a different experience here than other Yelp'ers.

For one, the food was run of the mill. Not blow-your-mind if you've got a lot of experience with *good* Japanese food, nor make-you-gag if you have the same level of experience.

They seated us quickly and came back within 15 minutes or so to take our order. This boded well. Except that once the order started to arrive, the problems started, too.

Most of it was minor - I had to ask for my rice three times. They delivered the Tempura sauce twice. All the empty dishes from the apps were left long after we had cleared the table ourselves and stacked them up to make room for dinner. No lid on the Miso so it got cold quickly. I ordered a Diet Coke with no ice, got a regular coke chock full of ice. And so on. Like I said, mostly minor annoyances... But it added up.

Other issues... the Beef Sashimi was frozen. I don't mean it was cold, I mean it actually still had ice crystals. My friend had to put in into the bowl of sauce that accompanied it just to thaw it.

My tempura tasted like it was from a package. Not soggy, but not really crispy and tasted kind of bland.

The mushrooms in butter was lovely, the mushrooms had just the right texture - but there were granules of something crunching between our teeth. Felt like they hadn't been properly cleaned.

I don't eat shellfish, but my friend's spider roll was missing claws, she said.

In general, the food was fresh, the presentation clean and neat, but the tastes were just... slightly off. 

On the plus side:

Many chefs put a lot of wasabi in Ngiri; Sushi Tei put more than I like ( just don't like wasabi), but less than most. The fish was quite fresh, not fishy-tasting at all.

The Hamachi Maki had a bit more shallots than most, so had a bit more kick. Wasn't quite right but the fish was quite fresh and smelled good.

Many Japanese restaurants serve wheat tea and let customers believe it's green tea. Sushi Tei's free tea was real green, and much appreciated.

Finally... 

When my friend complained about the ice in her beef sashimi, the waitress was less than helpful and kind of implied it was her fault for ordering it that way (my friend has eaten beef sashimi in many cities, including those in Japan, and has never had it frozen before). 

BUT: We received a free order of Tako Yako moments later as an apology. I don't eat octopus either, but I'm told it was quite nice. So they got the extra star in the review for quickly trying to make amends for issues."}
{"text":"Sushi Tei is my favorite Japanese/Korean restaurant in Mississauga. The restaurant is clean, the sushi is fresh (they don't skimp out on fish in their rolls!), the servers come often to fill my tea and they are so friendly! And reasonable/affordable prices!"}
{"text":"I usually go here during those days when I'm in the mood for sushi but everyone else I'm with wants something more hearty. This place has a great variety of sushi that is made well and with reasonable prices. The korean food is great too, unfortunately they lack variety for vegetarians, whereby they have like around two Korean vegetarian dishes. However, having tried those vegetarian dishes, they have been pretty good, especially the bibimbap.

The decor of the restaurant is so unexpected because from outside it doesn't look like much, but upon entering it will leave you surprised as they have gone all out and made it look traditional and classy. 
As for all Korean restaurants, I really enjoy the banchans they serve immediately after we sit down.
I don't really have many complaints, as the service was great. For example, once on a really hot day we got the cold udon noodles and the sashimi rice salad. The waiter made sure we knew the method to which we should eat these foods (i.e. dipping the noodles into the broth).
The only complaint I do have is that they don't serve the food all together, but rather serve as they are ready. So once when we ordered a sushi, a bento box, and a bibimbap, the bento box and bibimbap came around 10 minutes before the sushi, which left me eating my sushi alone when the rest were done eating, which I hate. 

So as a conclusion, I will keep on eating at Sushi Tei for their reasonable prices, good attitude, and pretty decent food."}
{"text":"Straight forward, point-form review.

Pros
- average to above average tasting maki rolls/sushi/bento boxes
- one of the better options in Mississauga
- meals generally come with complimentary small side dishes 
- environment/ambiance: average to above average - clean and nicely decorated

Cons
- a bit pricey; not that many price point options

Overall
- not bad for Mississauga, but you do pay a bit more than what the food quality is worth. But in Mississauga, this is pretty good."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I've come here and this place still isn't great. I got the niku don dinner which was okay. The beef that they used was way too rubbery although they give you a lot of it. The spicy salmon hand roll I got was good though. I also tried a few of the maki rolls from my friends, and they were also passable. You also get two banchan (side dishes) to share with your table. The service was frequent but kind of cold. Also, I should mention that my stomach felt off the day after I ate here although it wasn't anything serious."}
{"text":"I hadn't come to this place for awhile, but when I did I was a little surprised to notice that the price had gone up from the last time we were here. The food is good - I have the veggie bento box which is tasty, but it's nothing too crazy for the price. However, the atmosphere is amazing - they really decorate it up, and the service is good as well. I'll definitely be coming back eventually, but I'm not in the biggest hurry either."}
{"text":"We came back again because some of us were craving Japanese food. After the minimum wage increase, seems like Sushi Tei responded by raising the price too because the prices was different from the last time I came here. 

Because Sushi Tei is opened by Koreans, there were also Korean options! We had both Korean and Japanese dishes at the table. 

What's unique about some of their Korean options include the beef sashimi bibimbop! It's not commonly found at other restaurants so if you're a dare devil, you should try this bibimbop because the beef is definitely raw!

For the seafood soon tofu, it was alright. After having tried many places for soon tofu, i thought it was too spicy and it wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be. There was definitely a lot of seafood like calamari in the soup. 

The maki rolls like green dragon can be huge! So for the price you're paying for, it definitely fills you up!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time with my family. Its our go to sushi place when we're not feeling like AYCE.
Sometimes the service is a little bit slow, just because it's hectic, but they usually make up for it by giving us dishes on the house.
My usual is the Niku Donburi (I-13); stir fried veggies with egg and bulgogi with some sort of special sauce on top of rice. 
If I don't feel like rice, I opt for udon, usually Kaki, but sometimes tempura if I'm in the mood. 
The actual sushi is kind of hit & miss depending on what you order. The California rolls are kind of weak but you can substitute parts of your sushi order, so it's not a big deal. 
My favourite part is that they give us green tea ice cream at the end. Last time they gave us a deep fried banana too! If you read my other reviews, you'll see that I really love banana."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi Tei ever since  I was 8 years old (before the changed locations in the same plaza). I am now 24. I think they have now changed ownership, the son might own it now, but I am always happy with the service and food.
 I typically get the Tex Mex roll. It's so good topped with papaya, mango, tomato and really good sauce. Just enough spice how I like it. 
The Bibimbap is always a hit as well. 
 The service is always very fast and  they always give you those appetizers depending on what you order. 
 With the old owners we used to get some food on the house because we would order so much. The quality of the fish is always good. The thing I love most are the spicy rolls because they are actually spicy and put spicy pepper in it rather than just spicy mayo that isn't even spicy. These people making your sushi are legit. 

 You are always greeted right away when you come in and when you leave, it's nice. Like they actually care about the customers. 
I think there has only been a few times where I had to wait to get a seat but that is rare. They are quick with service so there is usually always a spot. 

 The decor and environment is nice. Might be loud for some but it's not bad you can always hear the person you are talking to. 
The best place to sit are in the booths because they are well lit and private. 

 If you're looking for a mix of Korean and Japanese cuisine this is a great place to go. Better quality than all you can eat but also a little more pricey. Definitely always worth it."}
{"text":"It's pretty standard fare, and pricier than other Mississauga restaurants with similar food quality.

ATMOSPHERE: They're one of the larger Japanese restaurants in Mississauga, so they can comfortably fit larger parties. They've grown from a small lot at Deer Run Plaza, to the corner spot they currently occupy. It's often quite busy on weekends as it's one of the well known joints for sushi.

SERVICE: Average. And when it's busy hours there, I feel like service goes way down - more than other places.

PRICE: Average.

FOOD: I feel like the food's gone down. They have a large menu, with some Korean dishes too, so I feel like they don't have the best quality of food. Places with smaller menus tend to excel at their few offerings, i think. I don't like how when you order a large sashimi boat, sometimes they just give you more of a cheaper fish, rather than higher quality for the higher price you pay.

Overall, I think this place is okay - but I'd rather go to Sushi One (Mavis/Eglinton) for similar price but better offerings, or pay a tad bit more and eat wayyy better at Hinote (Mavis/Bristol)."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here. It's not too far, has nice ambience and the intimate booths are really cute.

The prices are very reasonable and for the dine in tray and lunch specials have always satisfied my cravings!

I think the Korean selection is worth trying out as well as classic Japanese entrées besides sushi!

Go and get you sushi on!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to have a late lunch at Sushi Tei after doing a random draw on deciding where we would go for sushi.

There was no one in the restaurant so we had great service throughout our stay. Rolls that you should definitely try include: deep fried dynamite rolls, calmari rolls, and the spider rolls. The salmon sashimi were sliced thickly and tasted great!

After our lunch we sat there for at least half an hour just talking and they didn't even kick us out (y).

The bill came up to approx ~$70 for three people not including tip yet."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Tei and their lunch specials. Always great service, quality sushi and love the sides they provide. A little bit extra goes a long way! :)"}
