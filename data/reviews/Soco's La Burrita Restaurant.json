{"text":"We LOVE this place!  Their steak tacos are delicious and their tortas are my new second favorite.  My 8 yr old son says their burritos are the BEST.  We often place a second to go order to enjoy the next day.  They care about the food they serve and it shows.  As mentioned in other reviews, their food isn't fast food - which I appreciate and I don't mind waiting.  Bring a crossword puzzle to occupy your time or visit with your lunch/dinner companions.  Soco's food is worth any wait.  If waiting really, really bothers you, call your order in ahead of time and they'll have it waiting for you.  The restaurant is in an older building that could use updating, but it's clean and tidy.  Try it, you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Met my husband there for lunch as our preferred restaurant (La Tapatia) was closed that day. The place was busy but there were only two people working so we waited 30 minutes for our order to arrive. None of the tables around us were cleared in all that time and the flies became very annoying. My husband said his carne asada was tough as shoe leather and while my tamal was tasty, the rice left a strange taste in my mouth. $21 later (no alcohol) and we were both a little queasy for hours afterwards (and I have a cast iron stomach!). Not going back."}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant a couple of times a month to get my authentic Mexican food fix. Service is slow so don't be in a hurry but the food is worth waiting for. The burritos are huge, rice and beans are delicious too. I even get extra rice and beans and salsa to take home for later.  I'm a vegetarian so I've never tried the carne and pollo dishes but I know they are popular since I see people order them all the time."}
{"text":"Formerly Soco's Mexican Restaurant. Still excellent service and food (same recipes). The new owner is friendly and welcomes input. Some changes will be coming and they are now open on Saturdays  (which is when my wife always suggests we go)."}
{"text":"My daughter, my mother and I ventured into Phoenix to try Soco. Though the service was slow and the ambiance was less than desirable (2 stars), the food was amazing (4 stars).  My daughter ordered the cheese enchiladas. Yes, basic BUT the chile colorado sauce that graced the enchiladas was amazing. The sauce possessed an amazing balance of spice, garlic and heat.  My mother chose the pollo torta. This sandwich was flavor heaven! My dish was the pozole verde with chunks of chicken, hominy and a bit of chile heat. Also exceptionally good!  If you are looking for a casual Mexican restaurant with authentic Mexican food, Soco is the place to go."}
{"text":"I may be generous in giving this three starts but I had just one meal here recently and this restaurant has met the community's approval for many years. Their chili relleno was not a chili stuffed with cheese but a pastry stuffed with cheese and chili placed on a large tortilla that was spread with guacamole then piled with beans and rice. The tortilla was firmly wrapped around it all. It was very mild, even bland tasting. Most people will definitely want to add  sauce, but for those who cannot eat peppery food, this is a place for them. Most \"Mexican\" restaurants in the USA serve what was basically peasant food: tortillas, rice and beans (usually refried beans--how leftover beans are served).with cheese and a bit of chicken, pork or beef. Soco's features an authentic peasant food with tripe stews, beans and so on. The portions are large and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Best Tortilla Soup ever.  The broth is tomato and chicken based and very spicy.  Excellent."}
