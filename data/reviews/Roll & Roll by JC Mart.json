{"text":"I was quite content with both the quality and quantity that this hidden gem offered. Just a simple crunchy spicy salmon roll for 10 but definitely worth it... They had various other really delicate rolls and also a great value lunch menu on weekdays. Will definitely be back when around the area"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's like a one-stop shop that has a convenience store, dry cleaners and even sushi. I go at least 2-3 times a week. The owners are really friendly and sushi is amazing. They have lunch specials for $6.99 and other dishes are cheap too. I recommend for anyone nearby!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole in the wall sushi place. But it was like a hidden gem. The portions are big. Definitely value for money. I ordered the dynamite and spicy salmon(8pc) lunch special which came with miso soup and salad for $11. The quality was decent as there are better sushi elsewhere, but for value for money, I will come back to this convenince store. Don't let the fact that it's at the back of the convenience store intimidate you(cuz it did for me), but there were other positive reviews that I decided to try it."}
{"text":"amazingly good for a hidden bar in a convenience store, outstanding value.  fresh fish, gets all the basics right, great service.  the only sushi joint thats probably better is yuzu for 2-3x price.  i live in the area and go at least twice a week."}
{"text":"the quality of ingredients are quite good for an affordable sushi lunch joint (i would prefer this over a lot of budget lunch places) but the rice has a bit more sugar than i like. i prefer my sushi rice and wakame salad more fresh-tasting, less sugary."}
{"text":"Read reviews the other day and I just so happen to walk by on lunch and thought I had to check this place out.  I ordered the scallop & spicy salmon roll.  Very good!  Very friendly staff.  If I crave sushi on lunch i'll go here instead of the crappy places in the PATH."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the seemingly sketchy dry cleaners/corner store attachment! The sushi bar is truly a hidden gem in this neighbourhood. For $10, I got a lunch special sushi combo (6 pcs California Roll + 6pcs Spicy Tuna Roll). It's very reasonable for the price. While I wouldn't say the fish is top quality and freshest, I have no complaints (ie. no fishiness or stale texture!) You won't find anything novel and fancy here - just the basic North American rolls/sushis. Overall, mediocre sushi but good value. It's close to where I work and I'd definitely return just to speak with the super friendly sushi chef and when I want to crave regular sushi for lunch during weekdays."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Do not let the words \"convenience store\" or \"dry cleaner\" scare you away. It is clean, and a very good experience. And definitely sit at the chef's bar.  Fantastic, delicious, beautiful food served in a rather out of the ordinary setting by super friendly staff.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Literally a hidden gem in the core. Not only are the prices great but the quality is superior to anything you will find a long Queen.   Only downfall is limited space and if they do get busy it is a pretty long wait with only 1 or 2 guys working the bar.   Definitely recommend their lunch special and the \"Salmon Lover's Roll\""}
{"text":"Best sushi take I've had in Toronto. Get the C4 sushi combo. Fresh fish and great selection. Takes about 5-10 min but you can order ahead of time."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today to get dinner after searching here on Yelp for decent sushi places close to my work. I was a little skeptical, but decided to give it a go, since I was craving sushi and needed something quick.  Like others have said, this place is located within a convenience store and drycleaners, but appears to actually be called \"Roll & Roll\". I was surprised to find that they have quite an extensive menu considering the size of the place, and decided on my go-to of chirashi (assorted sashimi on rice, $16).   The chirashi was a decent but standard mix of salmon, tuna, hamachi, butterfish, and imitation crab. For me, the chirashi was just okay. Some of the slices of sashimi were very small, and also not the freshest. It's decently priced for the area, but the value wasn't amazing to me considering I can get a larger and fresher quality chirashi in my neighbourhood for just a few dollars more.   Will likely return when the craving hits while I'm at work, and may give some other items a go."}
{"text":"Sushi amazing   Best in the city.  Keep up the great work!   Highly recommend.  Sushi is presented creatively, great service.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Combo L5 (spicy salmon roll and dynamite roll) is awesome! Taste is good, quantity is large, good bang for the buck lunch!"}
{"text":"Found the best sushi in town through Yelp when looking for clothing alteration...   The quality of the food is remarkable, prepared in front of you by a passionate chef from Japan, who will accommodate your taste if need be. The sushi is delicious but do also try the butter fish...it melts in your mouth...delectable!   The atmosphere in a convenience store is not ideal but then again for this quality of sushi prepared by someone who truly enjoys and knows what he is doing, would cost close to double if you were sitting in a high end restaurant .   I would rather have a better price, and first quality food then atmosphere. Furthermore it is very entertaining to have the food prepared under your eyes!  I will be back whenever, I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that it's in a convenience store fool you, this is some damn good sushi!! I got the red dragon roll ($12.99) and the spicy salmon roll ($5.99) and both were delicious! Comparable prices with other inexpensive sushi places.   There is a little bar area inside the convenience store so you can stay in and eat or take-out. The sushi maker is a friendly guy and does his job well. Will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Sushi is good but service really isn't. Called for take-out a number of times and they always tell you to come in 15-20 minutes, regardless of how busy they are. I've arrived a bunch of times when they asked and they haven't even started making my order. Worse, the employees are just standing around and don't even seem apologetic about it. Clearly, the customer service needs some serious work - it could otherwise be a yummy and convenient sushi spot."}
{"text":"Despite the weird location (I don't think I have ever seen a sushi restaurant inside a convenience store/dry cleaners before) the sushi is pretty decent. The chef is friendly and happy to answer any questions you may have.  I had the $10.99 lunch special (dynamite roll and spicy salmon) which came with a side salad. The sushi was decent, although the dynamite roll was a bit on the chewy side and the tempura was soft. I suspect this was because my lunch special was pre-made, so I will be sure to order from the menu next time. The spicy salmon roll was amazing, and the side salad was tasty and fresh.  I will be back again to try some of the other rolls on the menu. At $10 for a HUGE lunch you really can't go far wrong!"}
{"text":"Late lunch after 2pm.  L5 spicy salmon and dynamite rolls for $10.99.  Came in a bent box with salad and miso soup. FILLING!!  Fresh ingredients and quick service."}
{"text":"Had a bento lunch here on Friday, and ordered the California roll and salmon avocado roll (total of 12 pieces). My friend highly recommended it, praising literally everything about it - from the sushi rice to the dressing.  To be completely honest, I didn't find it that good at all. The sushi rice was very soft indeed, nothing like the portions you typically find elsewhere. However, the salmon pieces weren't that flavorful at all, though there were generous portions of avocado.   The dressing was forgettable, in my opinion, and the wasabi lacked in flavour. Was not good at all! Overall, it was an all right meal."}
{"text":"JCmart Sushi is my go to spot for simple sushi. Lovingly called the 'cleaner sushi' by everyone at the office.  Yes... it's in a convenience store that doubles as a cleaners, but don't be fooled - their rolls are legit and very decent price. They've changed sushi chefs recently and their new lunch chef is pretty good. Also, the guy at the cash is super nice and friendly. It can get a bit slow during the lunch rush since there's only one chef and maybe a helper, but it's not too long of a wait. They have a special lunch menu that's fresh and filling (comes with salad, miso soup and orange slices). Can't go wrong with the L3 combo and it won't break the bank.  Definitely a good stop for fresh affordable sushi/roll/sashimi. They'd get full stars if they serve some hot food tho.  Note: Rabba next door also sells sushi but it's pre-made so who knows how long it's been there."}
{"text":"Just awful. The sashimi was NOT fresh, it was slimey and smelled bad. I ended up throwing it out. The prices are not cheap enough to warrant this quality. The place will also try to cheat you by giving you the least expensive ingredients. When you order the 20 pc sashimi on JUSTEAT, it asks you to pick one fish (which is strange). If you choose salmon, then you get all salmon because salmon is the cheapest fish. If you pick eel, then they will give you an assortment of sashimi. It does not make me feel good that they think they can deny me a proper assortment when I picked salmon, but at the same time, they are unwilling to give me all eel when I picked eel. They also forgot to include the soup, and when confronted, their attitude is just atrocious. I strongly advise AGAINST this place."}
{"text":"Fast service, fresh sushi, large pieces, friendly staff, and cheap. My lunch special (12 pieces-6 California and 6 salmon avocado, with side salad and miso soup) was around $11."}
{"text":"Just like other commenters say, it's weird but press on through the convenience store to one of the city's best sushi experiences. Normally sushi is rated in terms of quality, but the draw here is amplified by the creativity and variety of rolls -well beyond typical sushi offerings- plus the way they are *loaded* with ingredients. For your first visit, go when you have plenty of time because you WILL wait a while (it's totally worth it). When ordering, be forewarned that the rolls are thick and filling. After you've gotten a taste for their style of sushi you can can call ahead and pick up like most regulars."}
{"text":"Great sushi combo made to order, fish is very fresh and price is very reasonable, chef is friendly and the roll is delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Friday night after reading good yelp reviews. Like other yelpers have mentioned below, the place is a cleaners, convenient store and sushi shop all in one. But don't like that fool you, this sushi place is super good!   We ordered the Chirashi Bowl (which is Sashimi with rice) and Combo 8 which came with 10 pieces of dynamite roll and 5 pieces of sushi. Sashimi was fresh and everything tasted good. I really enjoyed the dynamite roll and will be back to try the other ones on the menu!   Reasonably priced for what you are getting, good portion and I was super full after dinner.   I think their lunch deals are better based on when we were revieweing the menu. Nonetheless good experience overall"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Having read about Roll & Roll several times on Yelp, I decided to at last give the place a try. My was I delighted! The chef was extremely accommodating of my friends' dietary restrictions (vegetarians), eager to modify the menu items we selected as needed. I tried the Volcano Roll and Yam & Avocado Roll. Both were quite nice, but the latter especially stood out - warm tempura yam with avocado tucked tightly into nori and fragrant rice really has a special place in my heart (and stomach). I really thought the quality was similar to more upscale sushi restaurants (e.g. New Generation on Bloor), but for a fairly reasonable price. If you like sushi and are in the dt core, this unassuming sushi haven is worth trying just for the sake of having a \"convenience store sushi\" experience anyways :)"}
{"text":"These fine people use a fantastic cleaning service. I've been going there now for 8 years and I would go anywhere else. Very honest, returned $60 I had left in my pocket."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the randomness of this sushi restaurant/dry cleaners/convenience store. The sushi here is incredibly fresh, beautifully prepared, and absolutely delicious! This place is by far my favourite takeout sushi in the downtown core, and hey, there's something to be said for being able to pick up your dry cleaning and dinner all in the same spot."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Not that cheap for a roll - $9.  But i'll be back for the noon-3pm M-F lunch special."}
{"text":"Straight forward affordable food. Thank goodness this place exists."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place, walked by a hundred times and never thought to step inside until someone recommended it to me. But seriously though, it's a dry cleaners with a neon \"sushi\" sign...I can't be the only one who's a little sketched out.   I found out recently that the dry cleaners, convenience store and the sushi place (inside the convenience) store is owned by the same family. The 3 storefronts are all connected in the back. The owners also have a super cute poodle that runs around the store if you ever pop by for a visit.   I've been to a lot of sushi places and I have to say that for takeout sushi, Roll & Roll is amazing! They have a huge selection of rolls and some really unique ones. Their rolls are also ginormous, with an average of 10 pieces. The prices are surprisingly high (min $9.99 per roll), but I think that's because they're so huge. They also have a variety of platters starting from $35/$39. We got the sashimi/sushi/roll platter (38 pieces) for $44.99 before tax and couldn't finish it all with 2 people.   The rice was good, the fish was fresh and I would 150% come back! I think I've found my go-to takeout sushi place that's close by my condo."}
{"text":"The sushi was very fresh and so delicious. I walked in and it was a late lunch for me. Very quite store and very polite chef and helpful. He made my sushi so great. I enjoyed every bite of it. Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've ever had!! Such a hidden gem, I absolutely loved coming here to pick up sushi during lunch. I mean, dry cleaning and a convenience store too - what else could you ever need in life? It definitely is a casual takeout place that serves its purpose of selling good sushi and doesn't do much more in terms of ambiance and decor (so you shouldn't take a first date here).   My go-to is the white dragon roll and its absolutely delicious! The fish has always tasted really fresh and the rolls have the perfect texture. Each piece is probably bigger than an average sushi roll so the serving sizes are fairly big too. I get pretty full without even finishing the whole thing so for the amount of food you're getting, the price isn't bad at all! I'd honestly prefer dry cleaner's sushi to AYCE just because I feel like the quality and price range is better.   As a tip, I highly recommend calling in for pick-up to avoid waiting there."}
{"text":"i was visiting my gf and this place is conveniently located near her so after parking i decided to check my curiosity by getting some takeout. i just wanna say im REALLY surprised these guys dont have a restaurant. we ordered 3 rolls (double dynamite, deep fried salmon and black dragon) the first time around and were blown away when we opened the boxes. they looked super legit and tasted totally amazing/fresh too with a good ratio of filling-to-rice.  *update* we came again and ordered rolls as well as some sashimi. thumbs up for consistency. meal was just as superb the second time around. young man behind the counter is very hard working. i think theyve found a loyal customer in me!   P.S. if u order a lot of food be prepared to pokemon go around the block and come back in 25-30 min while they prepare ur food or better yet call ahead to avoid the wait!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick bite or grab and go it would have been 4 stars if it wasn't for all the mayo. When did this odd sushi and mayo couple meet and decided to be together ever after. Divorce the god damn mayo."}
{"text":"Being a visitor to this beautiful big city, I was a bit skeptical of ordering sushi from a cleaners.  Based upon the recommendations on previous reviews, and the fact that it was so cold outside that even Santa wouldn't have delivered presents on christmas eve, I opted for delivery.  So, Miso soup to start.  Nothing special, just regular ass Miso soup.  3.5 stars Rolls.  Spicy Salmon, Cucumber Roll, Dynamite and Yam Roll.  These rolls are big.  Bigger than your average roll and very filling!  My delivery person was very nice, and took care of my order in transit.   Thank You Delivery Dude.  I'm ordering from here again before I leave."}
{"text":"I usually come here about once or twice a month if I want a quick sushi fix.  It is hidden within a convenience store offering lunch specials.  If you are in a rush, they also take orders over the phone. You can either eat at the sushi bar or just order for takeout. In both cases, you pay at the convenience store counter which is odd at first.  Their lunch specials come with salad and soup.  Then you add a choice different variety of rolls, sushi, and sashimi.  I order L6 as I like nigiri with some rolls as a balanced lunch which tends to fill me up.  Don't expect too much for the price but it pretty good value plus the fish is fresh as they have a large lunch crowd. I think more people come in for the sushi than buying from the convenience store.  It is outside of the path but a quick run from between the subway stations. Definitely will come back since it is close to my office.  Only wished today wasn't that cold."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi in Toronto.  A bit unorthodox being that the tiny restaurant is inside of a convenience store slash dry cleaners but whatevs!  The same gentleman seems to be the person making the food each time I have visited and it is very clear he takes pride in his food.  My fave rolls are the spicy salmon and green dragon - perfectly rolled, super fresh, and just YUM!!"}
{"text":"Ten bucks for a sushi lunch downtown with big portions is a win. We 'dined in' and then four others came in after for take out. Everyone of us were confused where to order and pay. You order at the sushi bar then pay at the cashier of the convenience store. If you 'dine in' you can just leave your finished trays and plates there. They also offered refill of miso soup. Quality can't be compared to a high class sushi restaurant downtown but for the value and quality given at the back of a convenience store, definitely can be a go-to place to satisfy sushi cravings or grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi place! Never would think a sushi bar in a convenience store would be good. Great quality and great price. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in downtown indeed! I was browsing on yelp for a a more affordable sushi place since all the sushi places in the PATH financial district are ridiculously expensive for the amount of food you get and I am so happy I found this!  Tucked at the back of a Korean convenience store, I was kind of skeptical at first, but $7-$9 for a lunch combo that comes with rolls, sushi, salad, orange slices and a miso soup, I really had no reason not to try.  And I'm glad I did!  I've been back a few times ever since! Sushi is fresh although the salad could be iffy sometimes, but overall, this IS a bang for your buck!  If you want something different outside of lunch combos from this place, I HIGHLY recommend the charashi as the portion is massive and the variety of sashimi it comes with is amazing (go look at my pictures later)  If you want an affordable and GOOD sushi takeout spot in downtown and don't mind walking outdoor for 10-15 minutes from the PATH, this is a place you must go!"}
{"text":"Nice place, they make the sushi for you fresh in front of you.  I orders the Yellow Tail sashimi and Salmon Sashimi.  Salmon was super fresh and oh-so-tasty.  The Yellow Tail, however, was a bit frozen :/  I don't know if the fridge they had it stored in was too high, and that kind of fish freezes easier than others but... yeah I had to let it dethaw a little bit before I ate it.  It was tasty and refreshing (lol) once I did but still have to take a hit for that.  Would probably go back if it was closer to my work but alas...."}
{"text":"The sushi counter itself is located at the back of the convenience store, arguably a little sketchy, but so well worth it for the price + quality. They have a couple of lunch specials for 2 rolls + a miso soup and they're super quick, so you can walk in and out in less than 10 minutes for sure. As others have mentioned, quality isn't amazing, but solid, and definitely much, much better than you might expect from a convenience store. Their workspace seems clean and they get quite a lot of customers especially throughout lunch and dinnertime."}
{"text":"I just had to check it out....because I couldn't believe it's a sushi + dry cleaners + convenience store in one.    Less off putting then I expected cuz there's a separate entrance for the dry cleaners and one for the convenience store with a sushi bar inside.  When I went inside I was impressed at how clean it was.    Not too busy at lunch time today but a nice steady flow of people, not chaotic and kind of calming from the normal Toronto Path lunch time lineups.    I ordered the lunch specials.  L2 which is the California roll with the dynamite roll for 9.99 and ordered the L5 which is the spicy salmon roll with dynamite roll for 10.99 and the total came to about $23.71.     Meal had very large portions and came with a mediocre side salad and miso soup.  But the rolls were pretty decent, though next time I would ask for more wasabi and no sauce on my dynamite roll.      Once you get your order (mine was takeout) you pay at the convenience store cash and head out.    They take credit card too so it's pretty good.     I'll drop by again for another quick, cheap, sushi fix on the go in downtown Toronto.     Thanks Yelpers for recommending this place, wouldn't have found it without you.    Was looking for a version Sushi Bong (in North York) but in the heart of Toronto and I think this comes pretty close.      I'm not giving this 5 stars because the food is mind blowing...but it's satisfying, quick, great location, kind service, filling and hits the spot without breaking the bank.  It's probably the only sushi joint around that happens to be inside a convenience store and a dry cleaners."}
{"text":"I was intrigued after hearing so many great reviews and how unusual this place is. A sushi restaurant inside a variety store/dry cleaner? wow.  In a city littered with AYCE Japanese restaurants, finding quality sushi has proven to be difficult. Even the ones that pride themselves on quality and the very idea of \"fresh\" sushi hasn't really lived up to the standards I have come to realize since my last visit to Japan. But...that's another story for another day.  This place is genuine. The sushi is made with great care despite their shoddy appearance. There's no denying that all the ingredients taste as fresh as it can be however fresh doesn't always equate to quality. This is after all...a takeout place. I applaud their efforts and their pride in what they do but in the end of the day the sushi while is fresher than most is still lacking. The prices are very reasonable and I really have no complaints if you're looking a quick sushi fix but it's not really as mind-blowing as everyone claims it to be."}
{"text":"When I read about this place, I had to try it! And, the reviews were all true. The sushi was very good and I've actually gone there twice on our trip to Toronto. And, when they say the rolls are big, they were not kidding. I had green dragon, red dragon (my favorites) and then the dynamite and spicy salmon. They are literarily 2x the size regular big sushi rolls and probably 4x the size of small sushi rolls. I usually eat a lot and my typical order size is 2 rolls as I love sushi, but I can barely eat one of them by myself. I'll be definitely back! The only disadvantage is that the convenience store does not accept American Express."}
{"text":"I was first skeptical about ordering raw fish from the back of a convenience store, but after trying it once I was convinced that I would be a regular. The sushi chef makes the rolls with care and the ingredients are fresh. Despite the location, there is always customers ordering takeout and I've always had to wait 5-10 min. Prices range from $8-$15 depending on the type of roll. Overall, it's a great place for takeout sushi if you live near by."}
{"text":"The best fresh vegetarian sushi I have ever had!! The staff is very friendly and don't mind modifying or customizing your order!! If your vegetarian ask them for the Veggie Dynamite with Spicy Mayo sauce. It's delicious and includes Yam Tempura, Avocado and Cucumber and topped with Spicy Mayo. They have lunch and dinner specials as well and they are priced reasonably cheap."}
{"text":"A dry cleaner, convenience store and sushi bar all-in-one? Yep, this is it. If there's a way to do this right, JC Mart is a shining example.  When I came with my partner, the condo above was having a fire. No worries though, I was still waved in for business. We decided to sit down at the sushi bar, the only place where you can sit, and we ordered a few rolls and some nigiri à la carte.  The sushi maker really seemed to take pride in his work -- it's hard not to notice since he's making it two feet in front of us. The sushi comes quick and it comes fresh. The salmon was smooth and the tuna had just the right firmness. At this price point, I'm used to gritty, just-thawed textures in my fish. The sushi rice was packed tightly enough that the pieces held their form during excursions of soy sauce dipping and wasabi spreading. Rolls were tasty, sauced properly and very satisfying.  But in the end, the cramped bar and bustling convenience store (and watching sushi master) made the entire experience slightly awkward. Definitely ordering takeout in the future. But if food is what we're judging, JC Mart Sushi (& Cleaners) comes out on top."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and decided to finally post a review. Location-wise, the sushi counter is tucked away at the back of a convenience store. Not an area with the highest traffic and I rarely see more than one person in-store, but I imagine enough condo owners give it their business.   On to food: Having moved to the area half a year ago, I was at first sceptical about purchasing sushi from a convenience store. Do they follow adequate hygiene practices? Is the fish fresh? Fear not. On my roommate's recommendation, I eventually caved to my salmon sashimi craving (I am a die-hard fan) and bought the Salmon Lover combo. This consisted of salmon sashimi, salmon sushi, and salmon nigiri. Sashimi pieces were larger than I had expected. Everything was fresh and succulent. Price was on the higher side (-1 star), so this would be an occasional indulgence. I hear they have lunch specials for select rolls, though I have yet to try them.   This is primarily a place for take-out, but they have a few (4? 5?) stools at the counter, should you wish to eat there. Call ahead of time if you don't want to wait.   Overall, excellent place for a quick, convenient sushi fix."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if I could. But being inside a convenient store is a bit off for me lol. This is a true hidden gem. Just off the financial district a bit you'll find this sushi take out inside a convenience store/ laundry store. There's only about 3 seats not really meant for ppl to sit down to eat. Just buy and take out.  The price is reasonable and sushi is fresh. Since I cannot eat sushi there's still a vegetarian option which is nice. The dinner comes with soup and really filling."}
{"text":"The sushi is made-to-order, fresh. It's delicious. Lunch is a deal, including a salad and twelve pieces.  I successfully consumed the spicy salmon as a gluten-free eater; however, note that you may wish to ask for no tempura and supervise if you're gluten-intolerant. He was really nice about re-making some rolls for me when he accidentally included tempura the first time.  Anyway, this place is awesome. Check it out."}
{"text":"It was good, and I'd gladly eat here again, but to give it more than three stars would only be because it is in a convenience store / dry cleaner!"}
{"text":"Most of the business they do here is take-out, but they don't know what they are missing by eating in at the small chef-side counter. (Wait, maybe I shouldn't be saying this or it'll be harder to get a seat next time.) Everything they make here is fresh and to order right in front of you by the friendly sushi master. I especially enjoyed the roll wrapped in a cucumber skin filled with fish. Watching him expertly cut thin layers of cucumber was hypnotic. The regular Japanese ginger dressing is fresh and bright, but don't try asking for the recipe, it's a chef's secret (I asked!) I usually just grab a drink from the convenience store fridges and pay for it afterwards. This is a no frills experience, but worth it for the quality and quirkiness."}
{"text":"Great sushi made on the spot. Could use a bit less rice. Like others have said, it's a small stall located inside a convenience store/dry cleaners with limited seating.  Variety is good and the guy makes it in front of you to order; nothing pre-made. Price is average ... around $10 for special rolls. Would return."}
{"text":"Very friendly guys there. The rolls are huge and fresh and unlike other places reasonably priced. This truly is a gem. Just try it."}
{"text":"Heard about this convenience store sushi place for a while now and finally got a chance to visit! We ordered a couple of special rolls, a chirashi (came with miso soup), and a salmon don to takeaway. The rolls are not cheap for a sushi takeout place, as most of the special rolls are minimum $10. We ordered the dynamite roll, rainbow dragon roll, and black dragon roll. The portions were huge, the rice and fish were fresh and of good quality! Definitely exceeded my expectation. I can't wait to come back to try other rolls and will recommend this place to anyone looking to get sushi takeouts in downtown toronto."}
{"text":"Not very fresh. I ordered it as soon as they opened and it already tasted like yesterday's sushi. Hard rice. Fishy taste. Lots of better options nearby."}
{"text":"What an awesome hole in the wall place! It's a tiny neighborhood Mart/Dry Cleaner that has segmented a portion of the store into amazing sushi bar. Very attentive service and extremely tasty sushi. Would highly recommend this for a fun dine-in experience solo (very limited seating) or for great take-out."}
{"text":"This place is quite good.  It is downstairs from my condo and we walk by the convenient store everyday but never went in.  Last Saturday, we were having a lazy day and wanted Sushi.  We were about to go on Queen but noticed that this place had really good reviews.  I joked to my husband to try the convenient store Sushi thinking it was grocery style meaning everything is premade.  However, after reading the positive reviews we had to give it a try and were pleasantly surprise.  There is a Sushi cafe inside a convenient store!!!  The sushi is made as your order and there are quite a few specialty rolls.  The prices are very reasonable and even better than some of the Sushi restaurants I have been to in Toronto.  Definitely worth a try if you live around the neighborhood and want take out Sushi."}
{"text":"awesome. chef used to work in big expensive sushi restaurants in the city and suburbs, but wanted a simpler life. he maintains good quality and house specials, even though there are standard options. great little lunch spot in a district which has few good sushi places, either sky high or rock bottom. only 6 bar seats, nestled in a convenience store. You pay at the store cashier, with cash, credit or debit. Last call: 10:15pm"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give it a try working across the street. Sushi Trumps the Rabba next door, definitely recommend to the lunch goers around the area. The Spicy Salmon and Dynamite roll were delicious and very filling. Will definitely be my go to moving forward ."}
{"text":"Definitely the most interesting sushi \"restaurant \"I've ever been to. A budget sushi restaurant which exceeds expectations. This is why I love Toronto. Tip: there are no washrooms."}
{"text":"I frequent this place far too much to not have a review. I always get the spicy salmon crunch roll. Huge portion and well-priced at $9.99.   Surprising quality, not what you'd expect from a convenience store/dry cleaners sushi store. Protip: Come early or order ahead during lunchtime. It can get busy as they make the rolls fresh one by one each time.   I'm sad I don't work near the area anymore because this is one of my favourite hidden gems in the city."}
{"text":"It's your one-stop shop for fishy smelling dry cleaning and mediocre, stale sushi!"}
{"text":"Rolls are large and filling - good price for downtown sushi and good price for the portions that you get. Their salad dressing is very tasty! It's not the greatest sushi rolls, but I think it's a really good lunch option if you are in the area. 4 seats at the bar only.  Good idea to call ahead and order take out. We ordered when we got there and waited 25 min for our bento boxes; not a big issue but if you are on a time crunch. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"The best sushi you will find in a laundromat/convenience store IN THE WORLD. The selections taste fresh, rich, and delicious, and it's not too heavy on the wallet. The lunch combos are definitely something to try out and well worth the money.   Not to mention the sushi guy who makes everything is very candid and willing to please.   If you are ever in town and craving sushi, check out JC Mart!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to find a casual sushi place in Toronto. I am not a huge take out fan, but I wanted to try this place from the reviews. I ordered the Kame Sushi (16.99) and the Dynamite Roll (9.99) to go, which came with miso soup for two.   I browsed the convenience store while waiting and they have quite the random assortment of things (from party favors, eyelash curlers, light bulbs, to frozen wontons).   The rolls were okay - not super memorable but nothing wrong with freshness or taste either. I was surprised the miso soup didn't have anything in it, usually there's some tofu and green onion. Not amazing but not bad for the price and convenience!"}
{"text":"L08 combo was great, who knew dry cleaning places makes sushi, it was around 10.99 for a lunch combo"}
{"text":"Great sushi served quickly at a reasonable price. My spicy salmon was as good as I've ever had. Wife and kids gobbled down their rolls. There was seating for 5 when we were there at 6pm on a Wednesday. You order at the sushi bar, then pay at the convenience store cash register.   The people were very pleasant and helpful. Don't let the multi-purpose nature of the business discourage you. Try it."}
{"text":"I was so intrigued by this place when it came up on Yelp and it's only a 5 minute walk from my work so I finally tried it today!!   It's such a funny concept- a convenience store, dry cleaners and sushi bar all in one but it's really not as weird as it sounds once you're in there!!  They have lunch specials until 3pm...I got one with a california and dynamite roll and it also came with a soup and salad....about $8.99  I don't think I've mentioned this before but I am a BIG dynamite roll connoisseur, they're my absolute favourite and there's definitely places that make better ones and worse ones.  The rolls were super fresh and had a good ratio of rice to the stuff inside! It was also a really cute presentation in the box and he put some oranges and the salad had blueberries! Different but cute.  Now to the dynamite rolls......UNREAL!!! I noticed there was something different in them but couldn't tell what until I finally realized..DILL! they had dill in them!! I'm a huge fan of dill flavoured everything, throw it on some dynamite rolls and you've stolen my heart. I don't think I can get sushi anywhere else now!!!  The California rolls were good too but tasted like any other California rolls...the soup cold have been saltier and the salad dressing was a little too gingery for my liking but I am not knocking off any points because I was so satisfied with those rolls!!!  The guy working there was also super nice, I chatted it up with him and he said he's the only one that works there! He said he has a lot of regulars- people who work in the surrounding buildings. I also told him he had really good reviews on Yelp which he had never read so I was reading some to him while he made my sushi! :)  I will 10000000000000000000% be back!!!!"}
