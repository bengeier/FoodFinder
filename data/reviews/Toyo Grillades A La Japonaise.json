{"text":"Had a great experience here. Our chef had lots of fun with the meal and put on a good show. Food was fantastic and a large portion. Great time all around."}
{"text":"Such a cool environment .. its awesome for partys snd the chefs always entertaining the guests I find it a very new york feeling... I love it. The food is great and so are the drinks , we went once for sushi .. it was great!! So fresh and clean."}
{"text":"Cuisinier qui met la bonne ambiance et une viande de qualité au rendez-vous !  Le restaurant est très calme et conviendra pour un bon restaurant entre amis ! Les prix semblent raisonnables vu la quantité dégustée."}
{"text":"It is not just a meal ... It is fun evening with a delicious food and a great presentation . I gave it 4 star because it is not at the same level of Benihana in Toronto and the US. I believe it is the best available Japanese grill house in Montreal island . It is a bit expensive because of the location."}
{"text":"It's a really nice restaurant , very similar to benihannas if anyone is interested ...I ended up getting the jumbo shrimp & it was made to perfection anyone that loves Chinese food would understand"}
{"text":"I  have been going to this place regularly for over ten years. It is consistently awesome. I agree with another reviewer, if you're in a rush, it's not the place for you. And it is awkward to sit with a bunch of people you don't know. However, more often than not, my fiancé and I are seated at a table alone which is nice.   Considering the portions, this place isn't that expensive. It is one of the only restaurants where my fiancé doesn't need to eat a second meal 30 minutes later. Our bill (with tax but no tip) usually comes out to $115. This includes a bottle of sake (I order the chicken teriyaki, he orders the shrimp and filet mignon).    In terms of the \"show\" aspect, I'm not a huge fan of this. I have only experienced chefs who really put on a show when dining with large groups. But this, for me, is a positive.   This place is our go-to when we want a filling, casual and awesome meal. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great staff, great location and great food. The chefs are amazing and make the experience memorable. Great Japanese food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date or even a party."}
{"text":"I was going out to dinner with a client and wanted something good near my hotel. My brother, being a local, recommended Toyo. Although you can get sushi here, the main attraction is the Teppanyaki.  As other Yelpers have mentionned, if you don't come with a large enough group to fill up the whole table, they will seat you with others and you'll have to wait until the whole table is full before the chef will start the show/dinner. Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.  Our chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).  Half way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special. We weren't there for anything in particular but my birthday was coming up that weekend so I told him I was turning 28. He surprised us with something spectacular (see the pic I posted!).  We really had a great evening here. I highly recommend Toyo if you're in the mood for a fantastic dinner and a show."}
{"text":"Bring a sweater and leggings/pants with you, because this place is freezing! There's something wrong with their ventilation/air-conditioning system. It might be warmer if you sit next to the grill.  The sushi is always good but I've never had the grill. It's a great place to get together with friends, family or colleagues for any group event. Children's birthday parties are celebrated a lot here. I plan on celebrating mine here in September."}
{"text":"the cook was really entertaining ! food was delicious and well seasoned and cooked. great for small groups !"}
{"text":"I don't have any complaints about this location. The salad dressing before you start is delicious and when I say delicious I mean the best out of all this grilling places.  Can't go wrong with the shrimp and beef or lobster tail and chicken teriyaki. Can't cope without sake or a Sapporo.  Haven't been in ages I miss this spot can't wait to come on by!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday. We were a group of 9 people all seated at the same table.  The food was very good and overall i had a nice experience. The cook was funny and highly entertaining.  Definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"bit pricey but great for groups. Not sure if it's good for dates. Food: teriyaki chicken was great! Shimps and beef were ok. It's just salt-pepper and soy sauce in cooked food. No special spices/exotic ingredients. Portions are ok, too.  3 starts just because it's entertainment else i'd have given this 1 star based on just food."}
{"text":"It's always a fun time with the food cooked in front of you. Nice quality and decently healthy... Price point is a bit high, but it's fun from time to time."}
{"text":"Showed up to a place less then 20% full. Guess it was Monday night. Waited 40mins before chef came to cook for us and only after I went to the manager to complaint. Chef quickly came, cooked out meal within 15mins and we were done in the same amount of time. Definitely not repeating due to mediocre food with little to no selection. The staffed blamed the 40min wait on a 20% filled restaurant on the chef being slow! Good way to throw your chefs under the bus."}
{"text":"Toyo, Toyo, Toyo... where do I begin. I was first introduced to this place 4 years ago, for my friend's 18th birthday. We had an unbelievably fun time with the tempenyaki grills and a wonderful chef/performer.   I came back another time for a company dinner (my suggestion, woo!) and they were able to accomodate close to 25-30 of us at 2 facing tables. We had another great performance by a chef and everyone left satisfied.  I've come back several times since, in much smaller groups. Unfortunately, the chefs never perform or make a spectacle for smaller parties only the large groups, pretty disappointing. Also, the food can be pretty bland if not seasoned perfectly - which has been the case the last couple of times.  It's also not really that cheap given the portions. Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - soup, salad and the meal for one price (rice included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion. Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties... which by the way, is incredibly awkward!   I'm sure there are better tempenyaki places in Montreal, but Toyo will make do."}
