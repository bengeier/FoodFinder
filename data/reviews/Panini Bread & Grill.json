{"text":"My wife and I had the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Wrap wrap (2) with potato chips and drinks.  The chips were more than good, they were FABULOUS.  And the wraps were nearly perfect.  OK, I can't think how they could have been better.

The only bad thing is we're traveling through to see my cousin Tom in Tucson on our way home to Santa Barbara.  But you can be sure I marked this place so I can return easily next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I usually frequent the downtown location off of Van Buren because it is in my office building, but it is owned by the same people. They make, in my opinion, the BEST cappuccinos. I also come here for lunch quite frequently and love the paninis. I've tried several, but my current favorite is the Italian, previously the Turkey Portobello. The owners are super sweet and go out of there way to make sure the service is good. Employees have been there since I've been working in that building too, which says a lot. This is my favorite sandwich shop, and I don't typically like sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yelp never fails to bring me to an awesome place and this one is no exception. Adorable mom and pop type of place with excellent food! They use high quality ingredients (boar's head) and they keep the price low. My panini was $5, which is a hard price to come by these days. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing food !! First time at this place and I was so pleased the food was tasty , fresh and the customer service was great !!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but I don't like to wait. Three times I've called to place an order for pickup and was placed on hold and they never picked me back up. Once I called in an they pick up the phone and slammed it down, hanging up on me. I'm done. However, if you don't mind a long wait, go for it."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick lunch spot with good food and free Wi-Fi that a girlfriend of mine could meet me at, and I happened upon this place in Yelp. We became instant fans, and are SO glad we found it! As soon as we entered, we were immediately greeted by a very sweet gentleman with a big smile, perhaps the owner? He later told us he was from Detroit. They have an extensive menu, which is clearly posted for you on a huge board - you can't miss it. We both ordered the Chicken Avocado Panini. It was fantastic! They use Boar's Head products...so good! Everything was SO fresh, and SO TASTY! We both just took turns saying, \"Oh my...goodness!\" My girlfriend, a tea lover, was impressed with the variety of fresh teas available. In addition to the great food, the Wi-Fi was fast, the place is clean and bright, the service was great, and we were asked how everything was - with a suggestion of what to order next time. Smart - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just ordered food for a soccer team dinner catering. Manager Neil was very helpful and the girls loved the food"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. Always a good choice in anything you pick off the menu. However, the only down fall there is here at times is when its gets busy, you can sense the tension from the owner to his employees which makes it uncomfortable to the customers while they are enjoying their lunch. Other than that I still love coming here to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious the best I love coming in and so glad they have extended the hours thanks for make food with care"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service and great tasting food!! Great selection of paninis and salads."}
{"text":"New restaurant in our neighborhood. Stopped in late but they stayed open to make us some sandwiches to-go. The staff was super friendly and even let us sample some cheese. Had a delish chicken buffalo sandwich. The panini bread was GREAT. Can't wait to go back and try another sandwich."}
{"text":"Just recently moved here to Arizona and I must say this is one of the better spots we've stopped and splurged at. I had the Ham and Havarti cheese sandwich recommended by the polite young man at the counter and it was absolutely delicious! My favorite thing about the place was that on the menu they had what's called the 'New Yorker', that being added extra meat and cheese (which you won't need because they give you plenty on the sand which!) being we are New Yorkers ourselves we had a quick laugh and enjoyed it. My boyfriend had the Rubin on a panini and he enjoyed it. The man whom I assume to be the owner was very funny. We had a very quick and funny exchange on the way out. Over all, I'd say go for it if you're planning on stopping here. It was an overall pleasure!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is delicious, fresh, and good sized portions! They deliver, and they cater too. Nice people, even veggie food, good variety, and they have desserts too!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this restaurant. The lemon cake was awesome and very dense and moist. The employees were all very friendly and accommodating and even gave us a free plate of their home made potato chips! They were delicious! They use boar's head meat in all of their sandwiches. I had a London broil panini and it was very good dipped in their au jus . Very clean inside as well. Also, one of the best indicators of how tasty of places is when you see cops or firemen at a restaurant. There was a crew of Phoenix firemen in the restaurant while we were there and they all enjoyed their meals as well (as evidenced by not a single crumb left on any of the four plates, ha ha) ! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We ordered some food for a production shoot and were pleasantly surprised. Everyone thought I did a great job picking out a spot, so thanks Panini Bread for making me look good."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've had in a looong time!! Chicken was sliced perfectly and panini hot off the grill was soft and delicious! Anistas the owner takes extra care to make sure visit is amazing and his passion for excellence is most definitely a part of his family history. LOVED!"}
{"text":"Great, food just found my new favorite place A+ staff members are super friendly quick service"}
{"text":"Great panini!  Prices are okay but are about combo prices for just the sandwich. The bread was perfect though. I'll definitely be returning with my family so they can check it out. Staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"in love with this place, since the prices are great, will be returning often. The Caprese is so fresh and delicious! Very friendly service."}
{"text":"A regular stop for brunch for me. The service is always great and the food is amazing. I love the variety of options they offer. There is something for everyone and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Great service very helpful and the food is
Delicious. Don't let the empty building around it discourage you."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and waited over 30 minutes to get a Ham and Havarti panini. Once I expressed my displeasure with the wait, the young Mexican girl in there yells at me saying, it's not our fault, it's lunch rush. Absolutely rude. Never had anyone in a restaurant or any other business talk to me like that. The sandwich was very good, but after the experience, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome taste .. I love the welcome from the folks works here . Other restaurant should learn . You guys rock .. 

Best I like is. Buffalo chicken and all soups"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while on the road. First off, this place smells like an authentic Italian deli and I spent my childhood on them back east. The employees were friendly and accommodating. I had an Italian po boy which was stuffed with Italian meats, peppers, and tomatoes. Also got a pasta salad which I though would be scooped out of a bucket of pre-made salad but I was pleasantly surprised that it was home made and delicious. It was very fresh and the pasta was still al dente, which a lot of places don't provide. They also have coffee and deserts. Really liked this place."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night for dinner.   I had the very berry spinach salad with the half cranberry chicken wrap...also had a small chicken enchilada soup.  Both half portions we're more than enough for my husband and I.     The place smelled really good and was very clean.  They have a large selection of panini sandwiches, wraps, salads and other things.  I will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Excellent find- a hidden gem! Try the Very Berry salad - fresh and delicious! Friendly service."}
{"text":"Best Paninis in AZ! High recommend. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The team here is super nice. I love the chicken Chipotle!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner! The menu is huge. My 5 year old especially loves their chicken nuggets and grilled cheese sandwiches. The Turkey Monterey Panini is excellent! The counter service is great and the owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Delicious food.
Owner is awesome.
Fresh fruit cups and other snacks.
Service is never compromised"}
{"text":"Perfect go to lunch hot spot. I have gone here about 6 times already and have tried something different every time and gets better every time. The owner is such a sweet heart and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  The service was great, the facility is very clean and the food was fantastic!  I had the chicken avocado panini and my husband had the turkey monterey panini.  They were both so good.  I told my husband I will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to have lunch and get some homework done. I got a coffee and a chipotle chicken panini. The coffee was cold and clearly leftover from breakfast. The panini was really good. Everything was fine until the owner or manager  started yelling from the dining area at his employee in the back. \"I pay you to make sandwiches not to sell weed!\" And so on. It was awkward and uncomfortable so I packed up and left. I definitely would never dine in again .."}
{"text":"I love this place ! The owner is very kind. And so are the employees here. They go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied with the food and service. The service is second to none ! And the food. Don't get me started on the food. The chicken chipotle panini is delicious. I always get it. And I always make sure to get the chicken enchilada soup which is also delicious ! Also the cookies. These cookies have everything in them. Coconut, chocolate chip, and macadamia nut. They are called everything cookies they are to die for ! Anyways. If you love supporting small business, love great service and food then you need to give this place a try."}
{"text":"The food is good. I had a Chicken Avocado panini with some chips. The sandwich was solid and the chips were really good. The bread was good and that goes a long way with making a good sandwich. Service was prompt and friendly. Our food was out fairly quickly. The establishment was well kept and clean. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"The food is good but if you want to walk in and eat plan to wait. Their latest priority is fulfilling online orders from Yelp/Uber type services. If you can't serve the customers walking in your door maybe you should be declining online orders. Twice I have waited over 30 minutes for a wrap. Last time the cashier warned me of 30-45 minute wait at 1pm. Hope they make some changes to how they manage orders. I will give them one more try but don't have high hopes of actually eating."}
{"text":"Delicious. Ordered #45 combo. Food was made quickly and is very high quality. Definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"The service was excellent ! Owner was very friendly ! Not to mention the food was delicious and fresh. I had the Monterey sand which  with portobello  mushrooms roasted red peppers-With pasta salad!!you know ingredients are fresh because carrots and lettuce were nice and crisp . I will be back and brining friends"}
{"text":"Our first visit and we will return! My husband & I went here for dinner tonight which served fantastic fresh food which was a great substitute in a city with so many fast food options. All of their sandwiches are served with Boar's Head meat. Yum!! We got the Turkey sandwich with avocado and the freshest red onion ever! The cole slaw was the best I've had in a super long time. Lovely selection of teas. Friendly staff; looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The sandwich was great! My wife and her cousin had eaten at Panini before many times, and she had always come back to Lubbock and tell me about all his delicious meals. So when I came to Phoenix, I wanted to eat there and the food was fantastic and tasty! Everyone was so friendly and the owner was super! We had a super meal!  I could eat several meals every week if I lived here! You know next time we come to visit, Panini will be my favorite place to go."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week and absolutely love this place. Their food is healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"The sandwich I ordered was very , very good. The problem with this place was the wait. I got there a little after 11 in the morning, no one was in there and it took me almost 20 minutes to get my food. I had to time to get back to work. I would suggest ordering ahead so maybe you will have time to eat it."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Delicious Very Berry Spinach Salad. 
Great Manu with lots of good options."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and delicious food. Haven't tried their desserts but I'm sure they're just as amazing as their paninis!!!!"}
{"text":"Update on my review from July....
Panini Bread has the most amazing food.  Everything I have ever eaten here has been freshly made, customized to my requests (if needed) and at a price that makes eating out both healthy and affordable.  This has become my favorite go to place for a lunch during work hours and I have even brought in the family a few times on the weekend.
The owner and his employees absolutely care that you enjoy your meal and they get to know repeat clients with a friendly face each time they see you.  I cannot say enough how good the food is and I am glad I went back and discovered more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite little places. I always recommend the chicken chipotle panini, but everything I've had there is very good. I am a big fan of their hummus."}
{"text":"DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE BY!
They have some of the best food I've ever had. Okay so let's start with the food, the paninis, I've had a few from their selection and they always blow me away every time. They are delicious, they are filling and the proportion size is fantastic. Their kettle chips are just as great, they have that great crunch to them and flavor, you get confused as to if you're eating French fries or chips. (Which I love) I've had the spinach and barley soup and the lentil soup and both were creamy, rich, and tasted great. If I didn't mention before about the proportion sizes? Big! You get delicious food in a great serving size that is cheap! The people that work there are so sweet and friendly, they are patient and very helpful. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an inexpensive mind blowing experience. You're going to love it here!!! I also recommend you bring everyone you know because you're going to want to tell them about this place ANYWAYS. I wish nothing but the best of luck to this place and I hope they prosper with business. They really do deserve it from the amazing food down to the friendly service."}
{"text":"I have to say I agree with all of the reviews. This is a family owned deli so when you come in and they remember your name and what you want to eat it makes you feel special. There are reviews on the wait times but all of the sandwiches are made to order not pre made and I make paninis at home and to get the perfect  crisp it takes time! Please be patient and keep trying new things very good food."}
{"text":"I came here for a breakfast panini. I got egg whites, provolone and bacon. It was delicious. I asked for tomatoes and they forgot but, I'd still be coming back here. Next I want to try their lunch paninis."}
{"text":"Very frustrated! I used to visit this place all the time, food was good. Went in today for two salads and a fruit plate. Order placed everything just fine until two sets of women came in after me, one for dine in other for take out. First the dine in got their food then the other ladies with take out got theirs.... they both came in after me and orders placed after me. We all did not walk in at same time!!!  I waited 20 minutes for 2 salads and a fruit plate...can't really say fruit and cheese because the amount of cheese was so minuscule. I like to support neighborhood businesses but this will be the last time I visit this one."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. Excellent service. Great price. What more could you want. Had a great experience when I went there. Enjoyed the sandwiches I got! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I went here while my car was getting worked on at Firestone. I was concerned about this place because I thought it was the same owner as the last place that was there, luckily it was not and the food was great! Simple, good food and very friendly staff. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great food, we walked in and my wife ordered a chicken avocado and I ordered the pub burger, and my son just a plain ham sandwich, and everything tasted on point. The burger was so tasty, the potato salad was quite delicious. The only that kept me from giving it a 5th star was the price, expect to pay 8-10 for a sandwich. But it was worth it"}
{"text":"Just tried this place last week. I had the chicken avocado panini with pasta salad. It was delicious and all of the staff was extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"I got the harvest chicken salad wrap with the enchiladas soup. Oh my goodness, deliciousness overload. I am so glad i found this place. Wildflower has gone down hill and so has panera bread. I like small shops with quailty food. Plus its super close to me, like walking distances"}
{"text":"Excellent panini's! Great Service! I wish i lived closer but we will definitely make the trip to eat there."}
{"text":"Waited to make sure this wasn't a fluke. I've been here three times with multiple friend. Between all of us we have had over half the menu and everyone has loved what they have ordered. The place is clean, the food is delicious, and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I live right behind this place. I won't lie that when I saw it being built I didn't have any expectations. But let me tell you... Just walking in the door I was very pleased! Right off the bat! Very welcoming, clean place. Their menu has panini's, wraps, salads, soups, deserts, appetizers, sides and drinks. They will soon be serving Coffee, protein shakes, and smoothies! I've very excited about that! I got the chicken chipotle. SOOOO delicious!! It was a bit spicy, but so good. One of the great things about these sandwiches is that the bread, even though it's grilled, it's not hard; the bread is still very soft. My husband had they Turkey Mediterranean. Also very good!! We decide to have one of their fresh home made cookies before we left and o-m-g AMAZING! The girl we ordered it from warmed it up for us.... Wow.... I might be there everyday for a cookie. It was an \"everything cookie\" nuts, chocolate chips, and coconut... Mmmm.... Hello favorite new spot!! Ohhh and the owners... So sweet!! Great costumer service!! I cant wait to try more thing. Prices also very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life?! There have been numerous times I've craved an amazing Panini sammy, but all the ones I've found (other than here, of course) were extremely sub-par. But lo and behold, I came across Panini Bread & Grill *happy dance*. 

Babe and I were hungry, and since I'm the Yelper, I did what I do best and found this gem of a spot. I love that I was able to place my order through Yelp, and just show up and pick it up. I ordered the Chicken Chipotle (added avocado) and the Chicken Avocado with the homemade kettle chips. 

Wow. Just wow. I barely made it home without devouring the paninis while driving. They smelled so delicious and fresh, and the gentleman working (not sure if maybe it was the owner?) that gave me my order was so kind and helpful, and greeted me with a smile -- great customer service! Thank you! 

Both Paninis were absolutely phenomenal! Babe and I were both happy with our sandwiches -- and so were our tastebuds and tummies -- and the kettle chips were so fresh and crispy, with just the right amount of salt sprinkled on top. You can't stop eating them... until you run out, that is. Perfection, I tell you! 

Sure it's a bit out of the way and traffic can get crazy around here, but it's so worth the drive. Good thing I found them... I am not ashamed to say I will be a repeat customer (aka frequent flyer)."}
{"text":"I came in for the first time today thinking I had made an online order through yelp, when I showed up the guys were so helpful & in showing me that I had not finished checking out my order & even though it was my mistake gave me a free cookie. Thanks for the learning lesson. As for the chicken avocado Panini it was really tasteful. The side of pasta salad was also delicious. Now the cookie, which I believe is a peanut butter cup cookie was so yummy & soft. I will definitely be returning to try more. Again thanks guys."}
{"text":"Little sandwich shop, brand new location at 35th and Bell. Owner was so friendly and welcoming. We had the chicken avocado panini and my husband had the chipotle chicken panini with homemade kettle chips! Pretty decent but not a lot of seating and was very challenging to find."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today on the recommendation of a friend.  I usually am not a fan of toasted sandwiches or paninis mainly because I don't like bread toasted.  I am a convert now.  

I got the chicken avocado panini with the potato salad.  It was made fresh and took a few minutes to get out to me but I really appreciate that.  It wasn't sloppy and thrown together but was perfectly stacked and neatly presented.  I loved that it was fresh avocado and not just some sloppy guacamole spread.  You could taste freshness which really makes or break a sandwich.  It had a pepperjack cheese I believe and a spicy aioli of some sort.  Not overly spicy but it definitely let you know it was there after a few bites and was phenomenal.  The potato salad is the best I have ever had.  I don't know what they add to it but it has a nice little sweetness to it.  I only wish there was more than the little side cup I had.

Not overly expensive by any means.  My combo was under $10 for a good size sandwich, 20 oz drink, and choice of side.  I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.  I live super close by so I expect to be a frequent visitor now."}
{"text":"Due to the disrespect that the owner had to his employees I will never go back. You do not speak to yo your staff, a person like that in front of customers...sad since my family liked the food"}
{"text":"This place is great. Everything is fresh and delicious. The salads, omg, the salads! Freshest salads ever! The service is always lovely. Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. My sandwich and homemade chips were fantastic. Definitely will be coming back to try more of the menu. A little sorry I haven't tried this place sooner!"}
{"text":"This restraunt is a small hole in the wall we even sat out in the parking lot debating whether to go in . Once we went in there is a lot to choose from on the menu. I got a chef salad and Italain poboy . The sandwich was so good and the chef salad was great also. Everyone that worked there is super nice we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have a great selection and everything is fresh. My kids were not the most excited when we got there and told them we were eating here but we had them try it anyway. Boy are they glad they did. They loved it. It is really hard for us to find a nice place where our kids will actually eat the food. They finished their whole meal! The customer service is great. It takes a little while to get your food but when it's fresh I don't mind. If you are in a rush I would recommend calling first and seeing if you can order that way. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, everything we order is really yummy except for the chips! 
High price 
The manager seems to talk down to his workers ! Which I didn't like! We have noticed that the last few times we have been there. Maybe he's stressed?"}
{"text":"Chicken Cobb Salad, Taco Salad, and Kids chicken nuggets..... this place is amazing! The veggies were fresh and had great flavor. The meats and cheese were good quality. The employees were very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the sandwiches in town!!  Try the bruschetta...  it is to die for! Potato salad is ver yummy too!"}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic. For that alone you should eat here. The bonus is the delicious food and generous portions. All of the wraps, salads and sandwiches are delicious. I want to try the amazing looking brownies and cookies but willpower is preventing me from partaking! The casual atmosphere, friendly staff and one-of-a-kind owner make this place a perfect stop. I almost forgot to mention the homemade kettle chips. Try them. Then next time have the potato salad. It's great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were wanting salad so we came across panini bread &a grill and decided to give it a try. We love it! So many great options for an unbeatable price. We liked it so much we got some to go orders for lunch and dinner the next day. Definitely our go to spot for yummy salads. Everyone was super friendly and service was also great."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  Clean, fast and super friendly!  Customer service is superb!!!"}
{"text":"Panini was needed in the neighborhood. Fresh made to order sandwiches and a great selection and ability to customize. Boars head  meat, excellent cheese & fresh bread. Will definitely try their homemade kettle chips next time."}
{"text":"I dont know where to start .. amazing place amazing food best service 
I love everything about this place"}
{"text":"Panini Bread & Grill has become our go-to place to order lunch. All of their sandwiches and panini's are made to order, have great portion size  and taste phenomenal!! Yes they are more expensive than a fast food place, but you definitely get what you pay for! This food is made with fresh, high quality meats, cheeses and vegetables. The bread is the perfect compliment and really makes the sandwich. They have a great eat-in area and they deliver. We have both ordered in store and online and have never had any inconsistency in quality or taste. 
HIGHLY recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Something for Everyone

This place is amazing, one of those restaurants you mentally note to yourself that you want visit again.  Today, I stopped by Panini Salad and Grill with a couple of friends for lunch. This was our first visit to Panini Salad and Grill but it won't be our last.

The staff at Panini Salad and Grill are friendly and helpful with menu questions and recommendations. On this visit I ordered the Chicken Harvest Salad (half size). This salad was fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  I couldn't believe the size of the half salad, it was large, definitely enough to fill you up. 

My lunch companions had the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad Wrap with fresh Kettle chips.  They both said the wrap was fresh and delicious and the kettle chips were incredible.  On my next visit I know what I'm going to order.

Panini Salad and Grill is a gem. Great food, large portions, incredible aervice, and reasonable prices. What more could you ask for.  If your ever  in the area you should stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how much I love this place, best sandwiches in town. Fun and friendly staff. Neil the owner is always around making sure that his customers are being taken care of. Fresh ingredients variety of choices excellent excellent excellent food."}
{"text":"I ordered the Reuben and the taco salad with humus to have for lunch. They both are super good and the delivery got here right on time. The chips are fantastic"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is inviting. Reminded me of a few delis I used to frequent on the east coast. That being said, the service has much to be desired. I ordered a turkey panini with a side of potato salad. Took 17 minutes for food to arrive. After two bites the food began to come out of the sandwich. The food was ok with a mix of turkey dison mustard pepper and cheese. The potato salad was really dry and think I should have got another side. I want to try this place again when a bit less crowded and hope it will be better."}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order for a few of us ($50 min) was excited to read reviews of the homemade chips !!!!
After order was over 25 min late I got call from driver can't find my house (I get delivery s ever day) I've never heard this before) order is delivered over 35 min late, the food and homemade chips are all soggy, I normally don't ask for anything in compensation, but this was a $60 order and this is Terrible  service with Terrible food quality, 
Neil the manager gave a 20% discount but I will contest the 80%, and never use again beware, 
I would think the food quality would be good if you ate there, not delivery. I will never know, won't go backn

Wow now customer being attacked for terrible food and poor delivery but thanks for the help were I can improve I have six one star reviews not 31 and I don't do social media, that's why I don't befriend on this site, so know u not only insult your customer but lie on them wow, lets see how long this place stays open, or has this many stars it's just a matter of time"}
{"text":"Need catering? This is the place!

So far so good. Five stars for catering; I still need to make it actually in to the location and update my review then. However, their catering excellence definitely makes me want to go.  Come rain, sleet, snow, or sunshine, they're reliable like the mailman (Ok, so mostly always sunshine here in PX but non the less). I was a little nervous having never stepped foot in the restaurant or met any of the employees face to face that my delivery would be there, on time, and no idea about the quality.  Well, all of my worry was assuaged as soon as I walked into the office. The food was already delivered and looked proffesional and delicious. Even better is that it actually was delicious.  

I spoke to Neal on the phone and he was very helpful with what I would need to order. Their invoicing process was a breeze.  I received a link in my email and it was easy to pay with my credit card right on my phone.  Very mobile-web viewing friendly.  

I will definitely be using them again for catering and I suggest you do as well.  Based on the quality of the food that was to go and packaged for a group I can't wait to get to go and relax while having one of the healthy items off their menu."}
{"text":"Got the panini gyro and pasta salad. Both excellent and customer service was amazing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I'm here at least twice a week. The food is good and the prices are low. The people are very friendly as well. I've never had a bad experience here. Just be prepared at lunchtime because they get extremely busy."}
{"text":"A friend suggested Panini Bread & Grill to cater my daughters 13th birthday party. I went into the restaurant to inquire and decided to place an order. The information and service was great. I'm happy I did because the kids loved it! When we picked up the order everything was ready, all of the sandwiches were marked so everyone would know what to pick and they provided plates and utensils. The homemade chips are my favorite. SO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This place that I stumbled upon is absolutely awesome. Great paninis and great wraps. They have the most amazing kettle chips that are even more awesome with some hot sauce. The chipotle chicken panini is the best panini I've ever had in my life. Let's begin with their meat. They use the brand boar's head and they slice thick like actual chicken. None of that nasty slim deli style cold cut bs. The chipotle aioli is so delicious. It went even better when I ordered the aioli on the side and dipped my chips in it. So bomb"}
{"text":"i really really enjoyed my gyro panini, that was great, my salad was huge too! I must come here more often!"}
{"text":"Solid sammich. The panini was nice and warm but not too crispy so it rips the roof of your mouth apart. I has the Italian and it was delicious. Also got a side of warm homemade potato chips. I was pleasantly surprised. I will be back."}
{"text":"Not bad for the first time. Its a pretty average  sandwich/salad spot, nothing spectacular but no complaints."}
{"text":"I left my wallet at work and set off to get me a grill Chicken sandwich. After the order was taken I realized I did not have any money to pay for it. I was beginning to walk away and they guy who took my order said I could pay another time. That was the nicest thing ever. I called once i got back to the office and I was able to make my payment over the phone. The Chiptole chicken panini is sooooo Delicious and the customer service was A+++++  Thanks again"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning for breakfast and it was lovely! The owner is the nicest person ever. He suggested getting the breakfast bagel sandwiches made as a panini instead and it was amazing! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the strawberry salad and added chicken. It was served with a delicious vinaigrette. The salad was crisp and fresh! Grilled chicken was cooked perfectly. They brought our food to the table and the beverages are self-serve.

You can order it to go, or eat-in. They have bar-top height seating. It's on the corner of a strip mall and easy to miss. Just keep your eyes peeled and check out this delicious deli!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Panini restaurants that I have ever been to. The owner/servers are so kind and always accommodating. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich place! The food is fresh and super delicious. I usually get a panini and chicken tortilla soup but also have enjoyed their salads.The staff is wonderful, this is a family owned business and they take pride in the services they offer. Give this wonderful place a try- you will love it!"}
{"text":"Love the food here it's always so fresh, when you're on the mood for a good sandwich or wrap it's a good alternative to hamburgers!  The only thing holding back the 5th star is the hours.   We wanted to go for dinner last night but they closed at 4 on a Saturday that seems a little too early and they're closed Sunday.  Other than that the food is delish and the owner is really nice"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, with quick and helpful service.  Very clean and comfortable.  Doesn't have the greasy smell and feel that some sandwich spots have.  Instead, has a light atmosphere and tasty food."}
{"text":"I met up with my husband here for lunch. The first time we came here there were only two customers. Everything on the menu looks good and the prices are reasonable. My husband ordered the corned beef panini  with a side dish of potato salad and a drink. I ordered the turkey avocado panini with a side dish of potato salad and a drink. We also ordered the Thai salad to go for later. Our panini were made to order and the ingredients were fresh. They were both really tasty and the potato salad complimented our panini. The Thai salad is a great portion and was fresh. We ended up going again for the second time in one week because it was good and we wanted to try something else on the menu. The second time around my husband ordered the turkey avocado panini and I had the triple decker club. Our sandwiches were fresh and prepared nicely. This time the place was packed. All tables were taken except for one and we were just in time to grab a table. We got to have a chat with the owner and he was a very pleasant guy. Great staff, great customer service, and delicious food."}
{"text":"yesterday, my husband and i stopped in for lunch and i'm still so pleasantly surprised at the experience we had! My husband had the pastrami, i ordered the chicken avocado.  I had asked the cashier to have them cut the chicken and avocado up very small. (i had a toothache)  they brought the food to the table & i saw that it hadn't been cut up. 'irritating,' i thought, but no worries. i could cut it up myself. I opened the sandwich and realized there were onions on it, so i picked them off & put them aside. The owner saw me from across the room and asked if everything was ok. I told him that i just didn't want the onion.
He came right over to our table and offered to make me another sandwich! I was really surprised.  Who does that in this day and age?  But it was what he said next that sent this experience over the top: \"Please give me another chance to make the sandwich you want.\"
I nearly fell off my chair! i started to give him back the sandwich i had, but he replied, i'll bring you a box, you can take that home for someone else.\"  Un-flipping-believable!!  Blown. Away. 
In just a minute, he was back, with a new sandwich, exactly like i liked!  I do have to admit that the posted ingredients of that sandwich, i now realize, include red onion. This makes his attitude even more impressive!  The food was phenomenal.  My husband says their coleslaw is the best in town & he said the pastrami was the leanest he's ever had.  All in all - complaints? none! compliments? a hundred and one! 
Thank you, Panini Grill for treating me like my business matters to you."}
{"text":"Awesome place for lunch. Their systems were down so they were only taking cash but they we're still so organized and the food came out fast and delicious!! We got 2 chicken avocado sandwiches and one side of their kettle chips which was all so yummy!! At the end of our meal, the owner came to our table to clear our plates and brought us out a fresh batch of kettle chips still hot from the fryer  to go just because he was friendly!! I will definitely be coming back and bring others to try this gem!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here a handful of times and everyone that works here is so nice and inviting. Very helpful when you're unsure about what to get, and very prompt when making it. Food is fresh and tasty every time I come! Very generous healthy portions for a great price!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service fantastic and I wish we would have found this place earlier. I would eat most everything on the menu. Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This the most cleanest most welcoming small place to eat in this whole area. The owner is the nicest and welcomes everyone in. The food is more than delicious and the cheesecake was to die for! This place has me hooked I wanna eat here all the time. The prices are very good to for what you get. The cashier lady is the nicest lady in the world she will recommend good stuff."}
{"text":"Our sandwiches were very good and the service was friendly! I would recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing! BEST POTATOES SALAD EVER! Seriously the best. And they use boars head which everyone knows is the top shelf of sliced meats and cheese. The staff is super friendly and they know how to recommend their menu. The prices for what you get are great. The place is warm and inviting and did I mention the potatoe salad? Plus I literally just left there, told who I presumed to be the owner his potato salad was good. And he sent me home with one to go for free! Talk about amazing service! He even walked around to check on his guests himself! I really love this place please eat here and definitely get the potato salad!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and won't be our last. I had the Turkey Monterey Panini and it was loaded with Turkey. The sauce/spread was tangy and delicious along with the peppers and mushrooms. My son had the burger which he said was juicy and seasoned well. We will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The best panini i've ever had. The fresh french bread was incredible. i would recommend this place for anyone who likes sandwiches...Very delicious and great staff!"}
{"text":"Good food but I waited 30+ minutes for a ceaser wrap and a kids meal grilled cheese sandwich. Kinda ridiculous"}
{"text":"The soup and sandwiches are awesome here, great and friendly service.  Cookies are tasty too. If you come at noon there might be a small wait but totally worth it.
It's a must try!"}
{"text":"The young man at the front counter is one of the nicest people I have met in the food industry. He is extremely helpful he knows the menu and is very polite. The food is always good and fresh. I love the salads there"}
{"text":"Will definitely be a regular at this place. Their panini selection is awesome and all of it is fresh and delicious! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great place! 
You walk in to a very warm and friendly atmosphere, then met with a friendly smile. The menu is in plain sight from all views, with many fresh and healthy options and great recommendation s from Neil, so dont feel like you have to sacrafice taste for healthy food. They have Paninni sandwiches, the best salads, a london broil w/ au jus that cant be beat. I am not kidding when I say they know how to serve it.
They serve very lean meats, on quality bread with everything else equally placed or spread on the sandwich. You wont find blobs of condiments. It is top quality. Everything is fresh made when you order it, nothing is sitting around waiting to be put together.  
I have been here many times for breakfast, lunch and dinner due to work nearby,  it is a great! 
I have to admit anyone who knows me knows how picky I am about my food. They have a great dessert section with fresh fruit and fresh baked cookies.  
If your like me I would rather have fresh food for about 2.00 more than the fast food joints. 
These people remember my favorite orders and me.
Next year I wont be at weight watchers paying to get the fast foods off my waist. Lol
This is a great place to eat! You dont want miss it"}
{"text":"My office had lunch catered from this restaurant a few weeks ago, the assortment was great! Great salads, panini's, chips, and cookies! Since then I have visited the restaurant twice. The food is fresh and the staff is nice!"}
{"text":"We ate lunch Thursday and Friday. Had garden salad, turkey panini, pastrami panini, chicken chipotle panini, lemon cake, carrot cake and a couple of cookies over 2 days. It was excellent. Owner (we are same age) and staff are great hosts!!!! You can tell they care about customer satisfaction. Will be back very soon.
Jim from California."}
{"text":"New place just opened up on Bell and 35th Ave. I tried their breakfast wrap and it was very yummy. All good ingredients. I will definitely go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a quick lunch. The food is good and the staff is always super welcoming."}
{"text":"I got the Mediterranean pizza. It was so good i wanted to get it again the next day. And they serve breakfast, I'll have to try it if i can pull myself away from that pizza."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this please and this weekend I did-and  I am glad I did!  I ordered the buffalo chicken panini and the chicken was perfection. No rubbery fake stuff or deli chicken meat here-real genuine thinly sliced chicken breast!  

My only complaint-Not open on Sundays!  But in all fairness it is a family owned place so they do need time to rest-so I am just being selfish."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast and lunch.  Never had anything short of amazing!  Great cooks, staff and owner.  Recently opened their coffee bar which is also great.  Local family owned and super friendly folks!  Will make to order most anything.  Have not tried anything yet that I don't like."}
{"text":"First time here, the girls from work always come back with amazing looking salads so I figured I'd give it a try. Staff was very friendly! I ordered the Italian po boy and it was SOOOOO good! Can't wait to come back and try everything else!"}
{"text":"A remarkably pleasant surprise. Stopped here for a quick lunch on our way up to Sedona. Both the chicken and rice and vegetable soups were excellent. Panini are perfect size and toppings were just right for each one. We had the turkey and the london broil. Need more lunch places like this in this world of crappy fast food and overpriced corporate fast casuals!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place at least 50x, never thought to stop in. I tried it last week and was really happy with the taste, quality and portion.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a better alternative to chain sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Great lunch place. Their salads and wraps and A1. Good extensive menu. Their southwest salad and veggie wrap were delicious."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! What a great place to stop for a quick lunch. All of the people working here are exceptional!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and timely delivery....only giving 4 stars because one order was missing the side of slaw we ordered. Loved the kettle chips though."}
{"text":"AMAZING. This place has so many great options and some for vegetarians! We started with the chicken enchilada soup, and it was great. I had the Turkey Monterey Panini with potato salad and I couldn't have been more pleased! Thank you, employees of panini grill! I appreciate you! I had the pomegranate green tea and it was delicious also! They have homemade desserts and I tried the peanut butter cup cookie that was so good! Perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"My first time here, the service is amazing! The environment is very welcoming! The food was delicious and they are not skimpy with their portions! My sister and I will be coming here more often. :). &&& Check out this huge delicious cookie!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast sandwiches. The owner is very nice and friendly and goes out of his way to accommodate you! I had the vegetarian panini and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch and highly suggest the London Broil with potato salad. Food was fresh and we (wife and I) split the extra meat size. Only bummer is don't split next time. Great service and friendly staff. This is going to be a popular spot for us and others. Great job"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place for lunch! They have a great menu selection  and everything is made with quality ingredients. Definitely recommend checking this spot out on your next lunch break!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better customer service. Staff is friendly, make great recommendations, and provide a fantastic overall dining experience. Food comes out quick but is of great quality. I hope this place stays around for awhile!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place the other day and i will definitely be back!! Delicious sandwhiches and sides for a very reasonable price! The restaurant is very  clean and plenty of seating. Employees were very accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Mediocre panini. The staff was friendly. The place did not smell very good. The sandwich was okay. The kettle chips were also just okay."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time. The
man who helped us was so friendly and patient. He let us try some samples and recommended some vegetarian options.

I had the Portobello pesto panini with a vegetable soup. It was so good. The bread was crisp in the outside and soft in the inside. Everything tasted wonderfully.  I'd come back here again for the portobello pesto panini."}
{"text":"I am not much of a sandwich person, but I could eat these sandwiches any day. A friend took me for lunch and it was delicious!  We each ordered a sandwich and then shared both were amazing.  Just took my husband, who is also not big on sandwiches, and he can't stop talking about how much he liked it.  He even called his boss to tell him about it. In addition the service is prompt and friendly. Try it out!"}
{"text":"We came in after reading since reviews on yelp and I must say this place is delicious. My wife and I tried the chicken chipotle panini and the chicken avocado. Also, their enchilada soup is pretty good! We'll come back for sure!"}
{"text":"An unexpectedly great find in the north valley. I've repeatedly searched for a good sandwich/salad place in north Phoenix and always came up empty, except for the usual chain suspects. This place is different. Unpretentious neighborhood shop. Friendly owner. Broad menu. Food with fresh ingredients that aren't just thrown together. Enjoyed a great veggie wrap and soup that tasted homemade. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Was looking for a lunch spot for a to go order and found this in yelp. So glad we tried it!!! Food is fresh, portions are generous, and staff is so friendly!  The selections are vast and appealing - it was hard to decide what to try! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! First bite, amazing!! Everything was very clean and nicely presented! The food did not take very long and was hot when i got it. I got the Chipotle Chicken which was a little spicy but very tasty! definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the neighborhood and we were very excited to try this new place.  Unfortunately our experience was lackluster.  We ordered the Turkey Monterey Panini, my husband said it was ok but could not taste any mustard on it, he said he would not get it again.   Then we also got the Buffalo Chicken Pizza Pita.  I ended up throwing this away.  It had giant chunks of cold chicken on it, hardly any buffalo sauce and zero ranch.  It was also given to us ice cold.  We also ordered the Cheese Quesadilla to have something neutral in case.  This was just ok.  It was also served ice cold to us and the cheddar cheese was super thick and the tortilla was not crispy.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Update:  There food here is so good that I couldn't resist returning. While I wasn't happy with the service, I can say this has improved. Worth a try if your are in the area, but know that due to their high volume of phone orders there may be a wait during peak times. 
Did not eat here today due to a 30 minute wait for food during the lunch hour. This is the second time this month that we have encountered this issue. It's unfortunate because I have really enjoyed their food, but after repeated service problems, I won't be back."}
{"text":"what a find. great sandwiches, sides, and super friendly service. loved it. will be back"}
{"text":"Clean, fast, friendly, great food and did I mention clean. We'll be back to try more. Will update review again."}
{"text":"Ahhhh had the London Broil today...better than I was expecting. Onions were perfect and sooo good!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm...mazing!
Too cheesy? lol I love love love this place. The workers are friendly and always make great recommendations. The food is OUTSTANDING. I recommend this place to anyone who asks about good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome panini and yes save room for a cookie or lemon bar. Staff very helpful and friendly. Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff who were more than accommodating with my son's special request sandwich. I had a tuna that tasted more like desert (I'm thinking a little cinnamon hidden somewhere???).  Good shop for lunches, friends and family."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I come here for lunch and for less than $10 I get sandwhich/panini (I love the chicken avocado and the chipotle chicken best), a side (usually kettle chips but the coleslaw was good too), and a drink. The gluten free bread is good too. It's a bit small but most are and at least here they still load it up with meat"}
{"text":"Wow went here for lunch and the place is immaculately clean, the staff was very friendly, prices are great and I got my food in about 5 mins. The Caesar Salad (chicken is a little extra but salad was still very cheap) was delicious. I think Ill be back later for some take out for my sick boyfriend. This place should be packed everyday, I love to see a quality local business like this one!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Stopped by again tonight. Good food, great desserts, and Neal the owner is a gem. Great local spot. Check it out."}
{"text":"AWESOME food and friendly service! The soups and sandwiches are delicious!"}
{"text":"Just realized my favorite lunch place is open for dinner too! We LOVE the very berry spinach salad and while you are at it, pick up an Italian P.O. boy to share! Cookies are AMAZING, our favorite is the \"Everything\" cookie. Top notch, get it to go or eat in."}
