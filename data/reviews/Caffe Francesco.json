{"text":"Francesco's Italian Market and Deli is an unassuming little shop with a lot more to offer than you might expect. The authentic market has all the elements needed to create your own Italian masterpiece at home. The deli boasts a wide variety of cured Italian meats (Capicola, Mortadella, etc) and a large selection of fine cheeses. The shelves are lined with premium Italian canned goods (no Chef Boyardee here!) and a vast assortment of dried pastas and olive oils. If you don't want to cook, not to worry, as the fridge is stocked with a variety of already prepared pastas and homemade sauces, so all you have to do is heat n' eat. If you just have to eat right away, that's no problem either, as the deli offers fresh made sandwiches that you can munch on at one of the few tables they have upfront. 
Viva Italia!"}
{"text":"Francesco's is a sweet and cozy little neighbourhood cafe/ deli. I went in on Good Friday, and ordered the most delicious veggie panini, and americano. The young man working by himself was super friendly, and let us stay and hang out without rushing us, despite the fact that he could have probably closed earlier, since it was a holiday.
The have some amazing looking pastas in the freezer,that I'll have to go back for at another time. Calgary could do with a dozen more local places like Francesco's."}
{"text":"The frozen pizza dough is incredible. (I would definitely give them a 5 if they had wholewheat). Unfortunately Francesco is a white crust purist.

Try the meats, cheeses and Mario's gelato."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee shop! The cheese selection is amazing but yes sometimes they have had issues restocking the better ones. Love the espresso they stock from Fratello roasters. There is also a selection of food including items from the famous Valbella deli in Canmore. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Bought fresh pizza dough here on Sunday. It was so fresh, it had been made an hour before we picked it up. I wish I had waited to get cheese and meats. The prices looked great! The owner so friendly and helpful. Will be going back often."}
{"text":"Located in Killarney, Francesco's Italian Food Store & Deli carries everything for that Italian inside of you.

Famous for their home-made tomato sauce, calzones, pizza dough, takeout dinners and pasta, Francesco's stole my heart on my very first visit.

Their locally made frozen ravioli is to die for, as is their locally-made Calgarian Pesto,  and thier Italian and Canadian cold cuts & cheeses draw crowds from all over the city.

Open Tuesday through Saturday, and boasting some of the greatest service I\"ve had in awhile, Francesco's is one helluvah find."}
{"text":"I love this little place! Great coffee, great service and great food! Too bad it's so far out of my way, otherwise I would be there more often. 

My #1 concern when going to a coffee shop is if they offer dairy free alternative. Francesco's has two, both soy and almond. Score! No milkmageddon for me today. 

#2 concern: is the coffee delicious? The answer is yes. Yes it is. Get in my belly. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about the food offerings. They have a huge selection of delectable-sounding cheeses. Oh how I wish I could eat cheese. Then there is the deli meat that comes from Scarpone's (a local Italian market). Then, there is sausages and meats, from Valbella, a gourmet food place in Canmore. Then, there is Take Home stuff, made in-house, like Mac n cheese fondue and lasagne. Then, there are sandwiches. It just doesn't end. 

So many cheesy things I can't eat but want to, so many temptations. I have to go back. I have no choice."}
{"text":"I host a grilled cheese club at work and was looking forward to Francesco's \"large selection of fine cheeses\", yet there were only a dozen cheeses in total. Regardless, the staff was really helpful and able to describe any one, and offered samples. I was happy with the cheese and meat she helped me select, so I'll have to go back to try the coffee and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this cafe. The latte was excellent and the panini was delicious.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Went in and ordered some deli meat and cheese. Then the clerk made a coffee for a man who came in after me. So I continued to wait at the counter. Then a girl walked in and ordered a sandwich. The clerk told me she'd get me my items after she made the sandwich. I asked why the man after me got his coffee first and she said that was a quick order. So I asked why the sandwich was also going to be made before I'd get my deli items and she said that they take a long time. I was very confused. So a quick order and a lengthy one would both take priority regardless of my presence in the shop first. So I left. I aim to support local businesses, have been going to this place for years (and it's not close to me) but now I'm done."}
{"text":"This is a little coffee shop with great coffee, great selection of cheese and Sandwiches. There is also a mini market inside which you can find Coffee Beans, Pasta, Pasta Sauce, Olive Oil, etc. all imported from Europe.
The service is great in there, staff very welcoming."}
{"text":"This is easily my favourite coffee shop in town. It's a true hidden gem with tonnes of character and some of the best food I've ever tasted. 

The guys who work there are unfiltered and hilarious, and they make sure to make everyone feel at home.

It's just a few blocks from my house, so lucky for me I've had a chance to try literally everything on the menu... you can trust me when I say, you truly cannot go wrong (but I suggest you start with a breakfast sandwich, beef dip, or a meatball sub). 

If I ever move away from Killarney, I'll be certain to make regular trips back for Francesco's!"}
{"text":"I love this little place. Most of all the service is so friendly, they really want you to enjoy your experience here. 
It is a little offbeat caf√©, nothing fancy, but a great selection of meats and cheeses in their deli, sandwich is made to order and terrific revel stoke coffee is served. 
Thanks also for the extra attention you show to my little granddaughter, she enjoyed her homemade tea biscuit!"}
{"text":"Coffee is okay but on the sweet side. Place is pretty cute and serve a lot of different sandwiches. Recommended if you want a cute place to hang out with friends.

Note: they are going through renovations so it might be loud inside the store."}
