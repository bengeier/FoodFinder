{"text":"First time tried it today with our friends, very disappointed and never return again. we ordered spicy Crab for $42 and it is stale and unfresh. The owner said we ordered it and they can't do anything with it. What a Awosome hospitality! The waitress was nice, we didn't want to give her hard time just asked her to take away Junk food. Guys if you are dare enough go for it."}
{"text":"After hearing bad reviews of all you can eat noodles like this restaurant I want expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised. Even though the side dishes look small and sent refillable, they are definitely enough for your whole meal. I've been twice already and both times I got the spicy soup both times and it's amazing. My friends tried the numbing spicy, hot and sour, and tomato ones. But the spicy one is by far the best one. I really liked the texture of the noodles as well. The soup is enough for at least two whole bowls of noodles, depending on how much soup you drink while eating. I recommend you guys try this place and I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Mississauga so far.  Noodles are great! Fried chicken appetizer the best!!!! Pig's hock or pig's feet whatever you call it sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Very good rice noodle, traditional food with perfect spicy soup. Even can be paid by Alipay or Wechat!"}
{"text":"Service was quick. Soup was tasty and loved the unlimited noodles. Just wish they were a bit more aldente."}
{"text":"The signature broth was good but the flavor was a little weak. The ingredients included on the side varied from lackluster to average. They provide unlimited refills on noodles but the noodles didn't inspire me to abuse the offer."}
{"text":"Went in last weekend for the crawfish. I went for medium spice cause I wasn't sure what they considered spicy.  It came up to about $21 after tax for 1 pound of crawfish. Expensive but absolutely delicious! I would totally go back in for a pound if I feel like treating myself."}
{"text":"A considerably quiet restaurant given that they had just opened for business. The restaurant specializes in rice noodle soup but also offers side dishes as well as crawfish for dinner service.   We ordered the Rice Noodle in Spicy Sauce and a side of Beef with Soy Sauce. The side of beef was disappointing as it was bland and even the chill dipping sauce couldn't save it. The noodle soup was on the other end of the spectrum. The soup was delicious... just right on the level of spiciness and sourness. It came in a set of 3; a bowl for the broth, a bowl of noodles, and a tray consisting of 'side dishes' and meat. At first it seems like you're getting a lot of food. Essentially, you put everything you get into the bowl of soup which gives you option of only putting in the vegetables you want. In my opinion, I think they should make the soup hotter to allow the 'side dishes' and noodles to cook better.   Note: They give free refills on the rice noodle!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The different soup bases! They have about 7 or more soup bases for you to choose from. I personally liked the spicy soup more than their signature soup because there were more flavor to the soup.   This restaurant would be the second one I've been to that has this type of eating concept where you get your soup and your noodle separately and then you're suppose to add the ingredients to your boiling hot soup table side. There's definitely more soup at this restaurant but the ingredients were lacking in quality. I thought the ingredients they have were rather not worth the price tag they put with soup noodle. Parsley and some green onion like vegetable were one of the toppings?!? And the vegetable you get was one green lettuce?? I think they could do better in terms of the ingredients they provided with the soup.   Like the other restaurant I went to, they also have all you can eat noodle. So you can keep reordering noodles as long as you like!  We also ordered a beef shank dish and the marinated pork feet. Beef shank looked dry and out of the fridge. It had no cool to it and it looked like a day old. The pork feet on the other hand was good. The feet were marinated well and very flavourful.   Last tip?!  Come hungry so you can take advantage of unlimited refills on the noodle hehehe. I personally thought their signature broth was okay, nothing special. I rather recommend you the tomato broth if you don't like spicy but if you like spicy, go for the one to three chilies. They're all better than their signature one!"}
{"text":"First time. deco is good. service is good. lady tried to explain how to order, but i didnt really understand.  ordered soup with 1 chili and another soup tomato based.   i suggest not to get the tomato based if your looking for a ramen flavour. the noodles are spaghetti like which i didnt enjoy  the 10sides were ok.   ultimate question: would you go back?  no, there are better noodle places to go"}
