{"text":"I've never in my life ordered fish tacos and had a waitress bring me 3 flour tortillas with what appeared to be tuna fish inside...no lettuce...no tartar sauce...no tomatos...no nothing just dry shredded fish meat in a tortilla. Some black beans with unmelted shredded cheese and cold rice. I ate one bite and left. I'm also bilingual and the men inside obviously didn't know. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"The food is served so quickly here, I swear they have mind readers spying on us in the parking lot.  But that doesn't detract from the food.  Everything is flavorful without being TOO greasy (I mean, it is still Mexican food).  The salsa is fresh-tasting and not too spicy.  The chips are warm and salty and the margaritas are just right.  The waiters are friendly, not so much for the hostesses.  The prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I'd give it a zero if I could. This place is weak as fuck. Mexican food? Please. I'd rather go to Taco Bell. There's a taco truck down the road that you're better off spending your money on."}
{"text":"Had a delicious introduction to El Salvadoran food. We tried the tortilla soup, the pupusas, and pork/chicken tacos. It was quite a lot of food but we came with an appetite. Hostess was very sweet lady from Mexico. All the dishes we had seemed to be authentic according to my limited knowledge (Wikipedia) of El Salvador. I highly recommend El Toro for something different and satisfying."}
{"text":"Food here is good service is always awesome portions are big. atmosphere is just ok but you always see smiling faces. All in all a good place to meet with family and friends for a good meal at a great price."}
{"text":"Great food...but they throw whipped cream in your face if anyone requests it.  No birthday necessary....sorry...not professional.."}
{"text":"I ate here after a day of near fasting and a long walk. My relatives in Monticello had no idea they served breakfast so as an out-of-towner I had to try it. 
Service was fantabulous. Friendly and attentive. I went there on a Sunday morning. I was super hungry so I got a sausage breakfast burrito and a side of pancakes. First off, they are serious about their portions. I had to leave the restaurant in a wheelbarrow. 
The burrito was good, but could have benefited from seasoning. I understand that people like varying levels is salt and spices so I'm not complaining. I just used half a bottle of Cholula hot sauce on it. Only complaint is it wasn't served with salsa. Otherwise, awesome. Did I mention it was the size of Popeye's forearm?
The pancakes were splendid. Perfectly cooked clouds of griddle cake, they were a scrummy buttery maple delight. 
I'd highly recommend them for breakfast."}
{"text":"Of all the El Toro restaurants, THIS one is the BEST! Service is always fast and meals are large. If you want things done up a certain way, they are happy to accommodate!"}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and efficient keeping you supplied with chips and fresh salsa while you wait for your food. Good food, very reasonable prices. Dad comments that the El Toro salad never shortchanges the chicken. And mom likes the generous portions! A must visit every time you're in St. Joe!"}
{"text":"Love all El Toros! Good family run businesses and the food is always good! Quick service and friendly!"}
{"text":"Oh El Toro, how I miss you so!  We knew when we moved up to Chicago that we would miss you, but never realized that we'd have such a problem finding a replacement that even comes close to your awesomeness.  Seriously, El Toro possesses the Mexican food trifecta - great taste, great service, and great price.  Thank goodness Urbana is a half-way point between where we live now and where my parents currently live.  Is it wrong that we stop there both on our way down and on our way back up again?   This weekend will be no exception.

Do they still have the antler chandeliers?"}
{"text":"Prix abordables, ambiance agréable, nourriture traditionnelle et savoureuse. Avec une bonne Corona sur la terrasse, la musique latine et les serveuses super sympathiques, c'est une très belle découverte! :) les tamales de elote et les pupusa fèves & fromage: miam!"}
{"text":"The service is some of the best in B/N food was great (I got the burrito loco) and a good place to watch a sports game, Definately one of my new favorite resturants."}
{"text":"had lunch here about a month ago during a site visit for work. my co-workers said the restaurant was recently renovated and i thought it was very nice. 

the food was quite good, was as good as any mexican meal ive had in arizona and mexico. the prices were very reasonable - we all were able to get quality sized meals for under $8. 

id like to go back and try some of their margaritas - i think this is a staple for a mexican themed restaurant."}
{"text":"Belle découverte. Un petit menu plein de fraîcheur et de saveur. Service accueillant."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican food.  Try out the Pepper appetizer to see how much of a man you are.  It puts hair on your chest.  Great overall."}
{"text":"I believe this place has gone down hill since it first opened in Rantoul.  The prices are getting higher, and the portions getting smaller.  

Service is always great thought.  Never a single complaint.

It bothers me that they have now brought in video gambling.  It just makes the place look more like a tavern and not a restaurant.  I'll be finding other areas to eat in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in from out of town for lunch. Very attentive and gracious service. The food was enjoyable. We will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Great place and friendly faces! Great food and service. Always leave feeling great and full! Never had a bad meal. Many birthday celebrations. It's a place to see and be seen! Our family favorite!  We eat here once a week or more!"}
{"text":"Okay, I've never been to Mexico, so I don't know how authentic this food is.  What I do know is that I enjoy it.  There are so many things to choose from.  You can go basic with tacos, burritos, and the like or try something more exotic.  The Milaneza (sp?) is a particular favorite.  The Burrito Loco is a challenge.  The salsa is excellent.  My family loves this place.  Whether it's going there for dinner or getting take out, we always say yes to El Toro.  The problem with take out is that we can't enjoy one of the best parts of El Toro: their Golden Margaritas.  Preferably the HUGE ones.  Staff is always friendly, service prompt, prices very reasonable.  Fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Out of all the El Toro's in the area (I believe there are 6) this is my favorite.  They are fast and cheap and good.  If you are looking for 100% authentic, this ain't the place.  But  if your looking for a decent cheap good Mexican restaurant than this is your kind of place!"}
{"text":"I did not feel welcomed here at all.  Our server seemed impatient and annoyed with us.  He asked us immediately after sitting down what we wanted to order.  I had no idea and asked him to come back after we had time to look over the menu.  He looked horrified but went away anyway.  He came back a couple of seconds later and asked what we wanted.  I felt rushed so I ordered something I have ordered in the past.  I really wanted to try something different and read the menu  But they don't give you time for that.  

The food came out in a matter of seconds.  I thought that was a mistake so I told the person balancing the plates that was not our order.  He went and got someone who could speak English to to tell us that they were what we ordered and placed them in front of us.  I had burritos deluxe and my friend had a steak salad,  The salad came without dressing so she asked the serve for some dressing.  While not pleased he did go get her some dressing.  My burritos were boring and tasteless.

They moved their business into a doomed location.  Nothing seems to stay there for long.  This is one place that really needs to go away!  It was awful!!"}
{"text":"Great place! The food is good and the staff is really friendly.  They even played peekaboo with my toddler."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service. Nicely decorated. If you are a soccer fan: they play the primera division."}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant needs to be updated.  They moved and changed the name to Taco Loco: http://www.news-gazette.com/news/business/restaurants/2012-11-20/el-toro-urbana-moves-gets-new-name.html 
The decor in this place still smells faintly of wet paint, and somewhat reminiscent of La Bamba in Champaign, if much brighter.  In the table, beneath the top layer, there appeared to be a footprint in the under layer.  Weird.
The waiter immediately asked us if we were ready to order, and when we said we needed more time, came over about every 2 minutes to ask if we were ready yet.  It wasn't \"Do you have any questions?\" or \"Can I help you find something to your tastes?\" but just \"Are you ready to order yet?\" every time.
We were brought chips and salsa and I ordered a bean dip to go with it.  The salsa was mediocre at best, and the bean dip was lukewarm and a soupy mix of queso and beans.  We were not brought appetizer plates, and so it was challenging to eat these without dripping.
The food came out unreasonably fast.  I can only imagine that they keep food in a warmer and not cooked to order, since food that comes out that fast should be HOT.
I ordered the Quesadilla Roja with ground beef.  The plate contained a folded tortilla, scorched on the bottom, and filled with a ground beef that was a bland version of Taco Bell beef and a smidgen of queso.  The other half of the plate was filled with shredded lettuce, a half slice of underripe tomato, a generous dollop of sour cream, and a teaspoon, maybe, of what they call their \"Special Red Sauce,\" which seemed to be nothing more than chili powder added to tomato paste and thinned.  I had a pepsi with that which came in a glass with a crack in it.
My dining partner had a Burrito Loco, which was about a foot long, covered in cheese sauce, and came with as much rice.  He wasn't impressed, but I declined to taste it to compare.  He also ordered a margarita which had this tiny bit of salt on the rim, and he said it very sweet, but it didn't seem to have a noticeable amount of tequila in it.
Compared to the time I dined at the old location, this is a very poor showing, and I will not be returning to give them a second chance, since the staff seemed marginally friendly, but indifferent at best."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food. If you liked it before ownership changed from one sibling to the other, drive the 10 minutes and go to Toro Loco off of Cunningham. Much better food, better lunch menu, and the serving sizes for food are much more generous."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Always busy and yet pretty quick service. Staff is friendly eaten here half a dozen times. Guacamole is great burrito loco is always a good choice but be warned it is huge !!! Chips and salsa are fresh and tasty, easy to make a meal out of that"}
{"text":"I've been there many times and I've never been disappointed. They have all the Salvadorian specialties you'd expect, and everything is delicious. Staff is very friendly and you really feel immersed in the culture. I especially recommand the pupusas and the ceviche. Careful though, they're not open all week and it can be a long wait if you're a group."}
{"text":"The food was inexpensive, but not very tasty. 
The chips and salsa were the best part. The enchiladas and tacos were made with the same tasteless ground beef. I would have liked more of the salsa, but the waiter never came back.
It took forever to get our check which negated the fast food aspect."}
{"text":"Just another chain joint food was fine, margarita not bad in its plastic cup. Food was a little plain really needs a few spices. Chips and salsa were fine salsa needed to be kicked up a notch, same with the guoacamole and the pulled beef burritos. So two burritos, guoacamole, one margarita, and the free chips and salsa $18.49 not including tip so not real cheap. I will say the service was top end fast and on top of everything."}
{"text":"As a lover of mexican food,I appreciate this place. Highly recommend the Pollo Asado."}
{"text":"Wife and I have been to lots of Mexican places from Taco Bell to really fancy joints that over fancify the food.  Of all places, this is my wife's 2nd favorite, her favorite being a joint just up the road in Rantoul.

Wife has been going since her college days in the 90's and to date she has not had a bad experience (maybe the only eating establishment that holds that distinction).  Had the lunch fajita's which I thought were mehhh. . but wife loved.  I am a fan of the burritos which I look forward to having the next time we are back in the area."}
{"text":"great restaurant with a great selection of inexpensive tasty dishes. Also, good for gluten free diets. The manager spoke to me personally and made a big effort to accommodate my special diet."}
{"text":"This is the blandest \"Mexican\" food I've had since my mom used to buy Patio Frozen Dinners. The salsa tastes like V-8, our guacamole was bitter, and the fresh tomato garnish on my plate was as hard as wood."}
{"text":"A typical hole in the wall type place. Menu is rather large with plenty to choose from. Food is average. Burritos are best thing on menu. The wait staff is friendly and helpful. Overall decent place to dine."}
{"text":"Sometimes they are understaffed at this location, but they are generally pretty fast. Very TexMex and not spicy at all, but cheap and consistent. Plus, their news brand of chips are crisper than the old ones."}
{"text":"I have never seen a better casebook for Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.

Setting aside the garish atmosphere, the first thing that established the tone of the visit was a server who came within a minute after taking our drink orders and asked brusquely if we were ready to order.  Despite the fact that we were still poring over the menu he came again three more times before we'd finally set our menus aside.  Mind, the place was almost entirely empty and hours before closing time.

My girlfriend ordered Quesadilla Roha with ground beef and a special sauce.  The beef was utterly dry and flavorless.  The primary taste of her meal was the burned tortilla.  Accompanying it was a salad which consisted of shredded lettuce topped with a single, thick slice of under ripe tomato (totally inedible) and their 'special red sauce' which tasted like tomato paste with a bit of red pepper.

I ordered the Burrito Loco which came with rice.  It came with enough rice for three meals and a burrito the size of my head.  The chicken inside was largely flavorless and there were some sizable bits of gristle inside.  The enormous quantity of rice was entirely unadorned in a large sticky pile.

I ordered a Lime Margarita.  I wasn't asked how I'd like it prepared and it came with salt, but so little salt that there was barely a trace of it on one edge.  It was also very sweet, and I'm not sure whether there was any actual Tequila in it.

We shared a 'bean dip' which was sized for a party of eight, and was almost entirely cheese sauce with few discernible beans in it.

Adding to the failure was that the food came out less than ten minutes after being ordered, which really highlights the fact that the food was almost certainly not cooked so much as reheated.  I would urge them to go INTO fast food if that's what they want to serve, but their beef compared unfavorably to Taco Bell and their Burrito was vastly less appetizing than any I've ever had at Chipotle, so I'm not sure there's room for them there either."}
{"text":"Always good food. Incredibly friendly service. It's fairly quick and easy with the best mexican food in the area"}
{"text":"I expected more.   OK Mexican food - part of a local area chain.  Atmosphere is only ok - needs a few screens or decor to break up the big square room feeling.    Food is ok, but nothing real special.  Another Mexican Restaurant (1 mile South of Town near Parmida) is about the same level.    I cannot believe both will stay in business too long.   But for Monticello, good to have some variety.    Wait staff is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is one of several restaurants owned and operated by the Fuentes family in the East Central Illinois area.  Good food, excellent service, fast authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price.  Its slightly tailored to American tastes and expectations, lots more cheese and sauce than one would find south of the border, but the waitstaff are almost all native Mexican, the chips and salsa are free and the food is served hot and fast, but you are definitely not in Taco Bell.  For a town like Monticello, this is a welcome addition to the Courthouse Square."}
{"text":"A poor substitute for Tex-Mex food. Uninspired and bland food choices. Seems to be typical for Champaign-Urbana :("}
{"text":"Fast and family-friendly Mexican restaurant that serves chips and salsa the moment you sit down. They also serve one of the largest margaritas I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Mmmmm....delicioso!  (Thank you Dora for teaching me something.)
Very kid friendly and very speedy!  Really good food."}
{"text":"Food was terrible! We ordered chicken fajitas. Chicken was incredibly dry. This is the worst El Toro I have ever been to. They had Pepsi, that was a plus, the only plus. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Upon my first trip to Urbana, the locals brought me to El Toro for dinner.  Being a city girl who has tried about a million Mexican places, granted I was drunk and it was 3am for most of those experiences, I didn't know what to expect from central Illinois.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.

I cruised the menu for my standby favorites but I spotted a Hawaiian fajita.  It was huge.  Seriously, I ate as much as I could and handed the rest to my boyfriend.  Even after both of us ate a ton, half the entree was still on the plate.  Wowza.  And let me tell you, it tasted great.  Perfect blend of authentic Mexican flavors and textures with a bit of a Hawaiian twist.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I'd also like to give them kudos on their guacamole.  It is so refreshing to find a place that doesn't overload the guac with lemon juice to preserve it.  I also appreciated that it wasn't too spicy, something that has been hit or miss lately.

We were there on a Tuesday night in early August so I wasn't at all surprised that they were pretty slow.  So obviously, we were well attended to and the staff seemed happy to have us there."}
{"text":"I've only been to this E Toro a couple times when I was close, usually I go to W Springfield.
If you like the one in Champaign you won't be disappointed here, great food and staff."}
{"text":"Very fast service. Good chips and salsa. Food was 'ok' except for the chili relleno I really liked."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Good price. Their refried beans are not good though. Hot sauce on the table tasted moldy. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Going to this place after Maize Mexican Grill in Champaign is like ordering a steak medium rare and getting it well done. Or like going to Disneyland instead of Disney World. Let me elaborate a bit.

I went here for lunch on a Sunday. I decided to get my tacos to go since I would be watching hot White Sox baseball at my place in Paxton! I was expecting the standard Mexican joint tacos a little bit of cilanro, onion....maybe some lettuce and tomato if I decide to get crazy?!

I went with combination number ten (two beef tacos, rice, and beans). I also added a chicken taco for 2.25. So all total, it was 11.06. I also got all corn tortillas. 

Word I would use to describe El Toro?

Flavorless...just like previous reviewers! Again, this is coming off Maize Mexican Grille...which was AWESOME! I can't wait until their sit down/restaurant place opens!
 
I had Taco Bell and Kankakee a few weeks ago and it was much better. I should have known this place was nothing special when all my students rave about how amazing it. Then again, said students also think Lil Wayne, Cheef Keef,  and Ke$ha constitute music. I 

Why do I keep coming to Rantucky? Well...there is a McDonald's and Walmart! I wish the Air Force Base was open. I bet there would be a lot more businesses! This town has gone down the tubes (that's what people say...I can't really judge). 

I believe I will be back due to the fact that my friends swear by this place. Maybe I will just have to try another item? Stay away from the tacos...I would rather have Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"This place has gone to hell! I just paid $12.00 for a plate of fat and grissle, smothered in cheese. They call this carne azteca. Not the first meal I've complained about either. Ever since Martin left, this place is mediocre at best. We used to love their food. Now we're just happy if its edible! I guess they think these small town gringos don't know the difference between good food and garbage. We'll just smother it in queso, and they'll love it. Get your shit together, and have some pride in your work."}
{"text":"This place is now called el rodeo Azteca, and it's awful. Our server had 2 tables, including us. He brought our friends Pepsi out when he figured out he forgot it, at the end of our meal. He brought my meal out wrong, the other table that came in after us was served and gone before our food even got to the table, and all we had was bean burritos and chicken nachos? We never got a refill on our salsa, just on chips. When he IDed me for my drink, he didn't know how to read my drivers license and had to go to the back and ask. The front of the store states the birthday customers need to have and I'm almost 25, so there should have been no issue. My margarita was virgin strawberry and I ordered a regular, with alcohol, raspberry. Food was fine. One of my friends got charged .33 cents? For her entire meal. I won't go back and I don't recommend anyone else to go either unless you appreciate crap confusing service."}
{"text":"The name has changed, but it's basically all the same menu and workers. We don't eat out much, but I do go in and order to go so we can eat at home. The food comes out quick, and they give us plenty of chips and salsa. My teenager is a vegetarian and really loves their vegetarian platter. It is a burrito with lots of green peppers, mushrooms, and onions. I personally would prefer the veggies sauteed a bit more, but she likes it. I almost always get the chicken soft tacos and I love them! I mix it up and get grilled and shredded. My husband lives their steak burritos. The portions are large, so you leave full. And the price is comparable to other Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Good little restaurant!  We stopped while traveling, and in a bit of a hurry.  The service was really quick, and the food was good!  They have a very extensive menu, and have a number of fish and seafood dishes, which many Mexican restaurants don't have.  I had the tilapia Mexicana, and it was very nice.  My husband had the fajita quesadilla and said it was one of the best he's ever had.  Chips before the meal were thin and crisp, with just the right amount if salt.  Salsa was good, too.  Wish we'd had time for margaritas, so I could evaluate those, too.  I guess that gives us a reason to go back again!    If in the area, I'd recommend giving El Toro a try!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this neighbourhood before. Find this one by Yelp. The outside of the restaurant is not sharp. 
Behind the restaurants there were several parking spots reserved for the customers. 
We had several plates to share. A tortilla soup, a fish ceviche, pupusa, a platter with fried pork and manioc to share. The soup was very good, thick and flavourful, very filling. The full portion would make a meal. I had a small one to share. The fish ceviche was sooo good. The freshly grounded black peppercorns and the lemon juice make the dish so fresh. And the chips were crunchy. Pupusa is new to me. I liked it. From the picture you can't tell it has filling inside. The fried pork was ok, and it would be better if with some spicy sauce. I would trade it for some tacos next time. Nevertheless it's my first time to try manioc, and I liked it. 
This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Oh pupusa, what simple yumminess (whatever autocorrect to me that's a word)! I loved the cow feet and tripe soup! (Yes I'm diverse in my taste )

Really get the cheese pupusa dessert  that's next to the cash register, they are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"New location, time to update my review.  I got fajitas and they were just...not very good.  Not bad, just not good.  There also weren't enough tortillas to use up all the filling, and I wasn't sure if I would be charged extra for more tortillas.  Ended up bringing the remaining filling home as leftovers and used my own tortillas so it worked out.  Food was served piping hot--no complaints there--I just felt like there was a complete lack of flavor.  Pretty disappointing, since I've never had a dissatisfying experience at El Toro before.  While looking at the menu, it also seemed like the prices had increased....not sure if I'm just crazy or if that's actually the case."}
{"text":"As with all the El Toro's the service is almost always excellent and it's always clean.  After Martin left this one, the biggest change here is the food.  It's quite often bland and over cooked and lacking any sort of kick.  The salsa is frequently nothing more than canned tomatoes with barely added cilantro and onions.  It's almost like they took all the \"Mexican\" out of the food.  I frequently order Fajita Quesadilla Chicken and I swear the chicken isn't seasoned or if it is, it's drowning in grease.  I had a hard time writing this review as we have been frequenting these El Toros since the beginning and really like the people who work here.  I've always wished they would all do more \"from scratch\" cooking.  I'm still grateful to have this option here in St. Joe."}
{"text":"Um, if you have ever been to Mexico or Texas, you will HATE this place.  The food has pretty much no flavor.  No cumin, no cilantro, etc.  It is bland, bland, bland.  I guess by northern standards it isn't bad but if you're from the south and know what it is supposed to taste like, you will be very disappointed.

The service was good but the food tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"We ordered Chicken Fajitas for Two for my birthday dinner tonight. It was completely tasteless!! As in absolutely zero spices and completely dry. There is some machine that they keep running constantly that has a worn bearing or something and just has this constant high-pitched sound that blasts your ears the entire time you're there. I wish the owners at El Toro would take lessons from other restaurants in the area to figure out how a fajita is supposed to be made. It was just an overall unappetizing experience. 

6 months Later....
Alright, so we are trying this experience 6 months later. It's January 1, 2018 and they finally fixed that machine!!!! But unfortunately, not the food so much. I am finally submitting a picture. Absolutely ZERO spices/flavorings!! Just totally plain bland. Guess I'll try again in another 6 months! (Agave was closed for the New Year and yes, we drove there first; this was a \"last resort\" for Mexican cuisine). From the image, you can see how there's nothing but plain-ness and bland. The \"ONE-star\" will stay for now."}
{"text":"El Toro is OK.  But as I state in all my reviews for Mexican food, I grew up in California  so I am a severe Mexican food snob and probably do not grade places outside of CA without bias.

first of all, I tried there Enchiladas, which was a mistake since oiut of 5 of them 3 were different kinds of beef.  Pot Roast, steak, and ground beef.  non are what I would call good.  The chicken one was OK and t he pork one matched the chicken.  

On the plus side my spouses burrito was decent but not the best that it could be.  

The chips were store bought and the salsa seemed pretty mediocre.  

The one thing I view that El Toro really did right was there re-fried beans, them were delicious.

the staff was fast and friendly as well which that alone is one reason I will go back.  I just wish they has a variety of authentic tacos.  But i guess you don't have to really try to hard in a state that doesn't know good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the chille Colorado last week.   It was a fantastic dish with beef in a hot red sauce.   I went to their sister  restaurant in Champaign on Neil and that dish was terrible.    I appreciate the effort here in Rantoul   Service was good as well.  Very fair prices"}
{"text":"Had dinner by myself here.  Other guests are latin-american (a good indicator).

Had ceviche and a glass of white wine.  Great!

Small pastry as a dessert:  excellent, light, sweet.  Coffee was great.

Recommend."}
{"text":"El toro was a delicious meal and the service was very good and the food was delicious and my lunch was delicious and the staff was really friendly and I left feeling satisfied with the choice of eating at El toro"}
{"text":"Well, I had no expectation when I came here. I ordered a Burrito Loco and I liked it. It was a good meal because it was a big & delicious burrito. Rice was good too. Overall, I like the place. I would definitely come back here if I come to Rantoul."}
