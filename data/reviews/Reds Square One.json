{"text":"Hubby and I tried this place out.  Funny enough we were hungry and were about to grab Popeyes, but walked by and were intrigued by the menu on the wall.

Glad we did because afrer a few small plates( appetizers) as it was refrerred to on thier menu. Were were delightfully surprised. Beautiful presentation and delicious food. We look forward to trying their brunches ( which they are known for) and the entrees!

Service was also fantastic. Very professional promt and polite. Our server in particular was very good, genuine sweet and professional young lady! We will be back"}
{"text":"Bit expensive, but good food. 

Highlights: butter tarts. apple pie, fries, 

At the very least come by and get a 2 dollar butter tart."}
{"text":"This might just be our new favourite restaurant right now. My daughter came out with my friends and I last Friday and requested to go back 2 days later for her birthday to have the cheeseburger.  She loves it!  This is my third time here in the last 2 weeks but have tried something new each time.  Tried the lobster guacamole for an app, it tasted pretty good but I find the serving so small for $19.95 and some of the chips were extremely salty.  Family and I ordered the tasting menu for $74.95 which came with half chicken, half rack of ribs and an 11oz steak.  Everything tasted good even the coleslaw that came with it.  You also get to pick 2 side dishes to go with it.  Service in this place is excellent.  My daughter even got a butter tart with a sparkler for her birthday!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a group of 11. Service was a bit slow for a table even the restaurant is not full. This place is fantastic with wide selection of Gin. I've order the make your own G&T with the floral taste.  The gin is serve in a giant glass with lots of ice, small bottle of tonic water on the side and the floral adds on (strawberry, cucumber and lavender). 
My bf and I ordered the tasting menu which includes 11oz new York steak, half chicken, ribs and 2 sides. It was suggested that this tasting menu is to serve 2-4 ppl but the portion given no way it can fill 4 ppl up. Maybe max 3 people if you are not hungry but 2 ppl was perfect if you are hungry. The steak with perfectly cooked. The chicken was still moist and you could taste it has been marinated for a long time. The ribs are so good and the meat can easily get off the bone. Side dish we ordered ceaser salad and truffle parmesan fries which it would be better if they added more truffle oil to the fries as the truffle taste was super light. 
For dessert you have to order their apple pie with vanila bourbon ice cream. It is the best apple pie I've ever had in Toronto so far. The crust was flaky and soft and the filling is not too sweet and you can still taste the freshness of the apples. 
The food here worth 5 stars but the slow service makes it only 4 stars."}
{"text":"We had a great time at this restaurant! I got the ravioli with shrimp which was delicious and fresh and the perfect portion! My boyfriend got the burger with sweet potato fries and it was real fresh good food! My cocktail was great and the mini butter tart which we just had to find room in our stomachs for was to die for. It is on the higher price point so will be keeping reds a top pick for special occasions! Thank you Red's we polished our plates. 
Recommend reservations on weekends as square one has become so busy."}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times now and have yet to be disappointed. The atmosphere and ambiance is elegant yet not over bearing, as to discourage from casual dinner or drinks with a couple M8s. The service here is on point with a friendly and outgoing approach. It proves that a smile goes a very long way to compliment a great meal. The steak here is divine. The menu is made from scratch and I absolutely love this concept. Everything is made fresh to order and it arrives hot and in a timely fashion. The drink selection here is also quite nice, although I am not a drinker my guests have all enjoyed the drink selections from the bar. If they don't have it the bartenders do an awesome job of creating something special just for you and give you the opportunity to name it. This is a nice personal touch and if you visit more than once you can be sure that you will be remembered. That is also a good touch of personalised approach to service. I've had the Meatpie and it was absolutely fantastic and thier home chips are made very fresh and crispy to my liking. I've also had the Rotisserie Chicken which is month watering and very tender with every bite. Again the veggies are freshly cooked to perfection And seasoned just right as to not take away from the freshness. The burgers here are delicious and very juicy. Well seasoned Beef Patty and grilled to perfection. Definitelya class act when you eat at Red's. 

I would recommend reserving a table online via thier website with the easy table reservation tool to avoid having to wait. However if you have a wait it is relatively short and there is lots to do in the mall while you wait for your text. I highly recommend checking out Red's Square One. You won't be disappointed and you will find the service friendly and the food divine. Enjoy your visit to Red's."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here but this review shows its my first.....they probably didn't have the square one location when I visited the 1st 2 times so those reviews are just under \"Reds\".
Anyway......an absolutely fantastic experience!
My niece and I went for dinner on a Sunday and the place was full, with a lineup at the door at one point.
We skipped apps and went straight for the quinoa bowl. My niece had it as is and mine was with no cheese. Fantastic taste, great presentation!
I had the butter tart(S) for dessert and my niece had the apple pie and ice cream. I know the tart has gluten and dairy but I could not resist. It was small, warm and delicious. So good in fact, I ordered another and 2 to take Home for my son. Sadly my second wasn't warm but still tasted good. Needless to say, my son never got his 2.
My niece enjoyed the pie but I wasn't a fan of it.
Our server was excellent! Friendly, helpful, attentive and constantly filling our water.
In my last review I commented on how there was only one male and female washroom....I was wrong!! There is another hallway with several other stalls!
The bar was busy, Olympic closing events were airing on the tv screens, but the noise level was bearable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a glass of Red Wine and maybe a snack. If there is one thing that bothers me it is when the bar staff are more preoccupied with each other or whatever. There were two or three bartenders (or maybe random staff behind the bar). I waited while they passed me several times before acknowledging me. Another gentleman sat near me and had to ask for the server... as did an other group. Haven't decided yet whether I will eat. Basic menu with normal unimaginative fare! 
Nice crystal water glasses... teach the staff to acknowledge new customers instantly even if they are busy!"}
{"text":"Went with a business associate, nice atmosphere. Service was fine. Food was absolutely terrible. We both ordered prime rib $30 each. It came out undercooked and cold. The fat on the edges was pure white and had thick greasy cold fat taste. The potatoes and vegetables were cold too. It came like 5 mins after we ordered it. I didn't say anything to the server because I was in a biz meeting. I will never go back for food. Maybe for a cocktail."}
{"text":"Went to Red's for the first time. A little disappointed as they dont serve frozen margarita. I thought it would have been perfect for Calamari and Tuna Tostadas for a start.

I had ordered Salmon Bibimbap with sauce on the side. It was tasty but not so great.

Their Butter Tart was good as well."}
{"text":"I visited the Reds at Square one with a friend on a Monday evening. The restaurant had a pretty good atmosphere and good customer service. We were seated right away and the didn't wait too long for the food. The food was really good. We ordered the following dishes, 
11 oz mushroom new york steak cooked well done, the meat was tender and nicely done with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The bangkok nachos was delicious and the sushi press as well. I didn't get to try the Ahi tuna tostados because I was full after finishing the steam but my friend told me that was also a great choice! 
Will visit again!"}
{"text":"What a cool place! 
Rustic retro feel.
Old shoes and purses displayed in the bar area on the walls. Billiards table in the back and shuffle table.
We sat at the bar tables attached to the bar and got served by the bartender which was cool! He was very friendly and talkative.
This place was a feel good, fun vibes only! 
Everyone was drinking and having a goooddd time.
We ordered the kale quinoa salad and the beetroot hummus- YUM!
Prices are a little higher but that way you get a decent crowd coming in.
For the salad, hummus and a glass of wine came to about 45$.
Really nice place to go have a drink after a long day of shopping."}
