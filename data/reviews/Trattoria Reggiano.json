{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it only gets better. The service is fantastic and it has the charm of a cafe in Venice. I would highly recommend the fillet mignon meatballs and the eggplant appetizers. Great wine list and great prices for AMAZING food. Will be back soon! If you want a great time ask for Lyndsay as your server."}
{"text":"Nice lady that seated us but it was all downhill from there.   WAY OVERPRICED!!!!  They charge $8 for an iced tea!!!!  So we ordered a diet Pepsi instead $4, thinking I could choke that down since this is a Vegas hotel and $4 is standard (albeit criminal)...... Out comes a super tiny glass bottle of diet Pepsi with a glass of ice. I didn't even know they made glass bottles that small. It was sent back.   The linguini bolognese was bland. Plus, we ordered spaghettini (thin spaghetti) instead of linguini, but got linguini.... Maybe that's because the guy didn't write anything down.  He also didn't check on us, despite walking by about 5 times (this place is VERY small) until we were half way through our meals. He offered to remake the meals, but we said not to bother.   Conclusion: A RIPOFF FOR BLAND FOOD. GO ELSEWHERE."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and it was okay...not impressed at all. It was a cute place but the waiter was unapproachable and seemed annoyed by us every time we asked him something (aka to get the menu again etc.). After reading the other reviews I was expecting amazing food and service but it was very average and not good customer service. Oh and the garlic rolls weren't that great either like others said. Wompssss!!!"}
{"text":"Our server Reilly was very sweet and gave us great advice. Reasonably priced and very tasty."}
{"text":"We had a great attentive server. Lobster ravioli was to die for! Did not try the meatballs but they looked good. Garlic knots were delicious"}
{"text":"Ordered the gnocchi with pesto and penne with meatballs, both were delicious and large portions. Service was friendly. Food came very quickly."}
{"text":"Alright yelpers maybe we went on an \"off-night\" and didn't get the experience some of the others have described in their reviews, but this place is terrible! Right off the bat, my husband & I stood around like weirdos waiting to be acknowledged to be seated...when there was an empty table...yes Mr. Waiter we are here to eat & not just standing around in front of your restaurant to watch others eat...jeezz! So we get to sit & don't feel very welcomed. ..money is still green right? Anyways we order the ceasar salad & shrimp scampi, the salad was just like any other you can get anywhere & our pasta dish was blah! It didn't look appetizing and had unnecessary bread crumb crap on top of the shrimp that my husband & I both had to scrape off to taste the flavor of the shrimp. Oh and the garlic bread that I was sooo looking forward to after reading the other reviews wasn't great, I don't know if we got an old batch or they cooked ours differently, but they lacked flavor. We will absolutely never eat here again even if it's the last Italian restaurant left in Vegas. Our waiter never checked on us once delivering our food, only to leave the overpriced bill for our overrated food that lacked flavor & quality. ...to others reading this & craving Italian food late at night...go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came during our anniversary trip. I was looking for a great non-celebrity chef Italian place for dinner and read all of the great reviews on this little gem. We were not disappointed! It is kind of hidden away from other restaurants, has limited seating but we had no problem getting a table immediately. The garlic rolls were so fresh and garlic-y! Husband ordered a delicious red wine - dont recall the exact name but it was a $38 Primativo. Our entrees came out very quickly and piping hot. Husband had gnocchi with pesto sauce and I the linguini carbonara. Pesto sauce w as extremely fresh and vibrantly green. The gnocchi was the perfect texture, not gummy or pastey. The carbonara was so creamy yet light. Even though we ate all of our entrees and were extremely full, we decided to share the tiramasu. We managed to polish it off quickly! Highly recommend! We will definitely make this a regular stop on all of our future trips."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised, actually shocked, by this place averaging 4 stars after 60+ reviews! I definitely do not get this one at all!!! I guess I must be a little jaded because I grew up in an small town area of New York where probably half, maybe more, of the restaurants were owned by Italians. When I first walked up to this place I was a little reluctant to eat here. In fact, after looking at the plates on the tables my friend and I kept on walking. However, we couldn't make a decision on where else to eat so we turned around and went back. Oops! (why didn't I listen to my first impression?) The dinner rolls that were served at the beginning of the meal were cold and tasteless. I certainly hope they were not the garlic rolls that I see praised in several reviews. If they were then they must have forgotten the garlic with these rolls. The only redeeming part of my meal was the eggplant rotelli appetizer which was rolled up eggplant with ricotta cheese covered with a pomodoro sauce. If I was forced to eat here again then this is what I would order.  The meal I ordered was Chicken parmigiana. I guess I must have strayed too far from their mainstays on this one. The chicken was very tough. It tasted as if it was frozen the heated up in a microwave. The pasta served with it was covered in the pomodoro sauce which actually is uninspiring but goes well with the eggplant and ricotta. The pasta also tasted like it came from the microwave. In fact, the past was so hot I cannot see how it could have been made any other way. It didn't dawn on me that an Italian place could not at least make an edible chicken parmigiana.  The service was okay, but I would not call it a friendly place. I guess their goal is to serve 5% of the people that walk by their establishment at least once in their lifetime which is enough to make a go of the business.  If you ever spent time eating at restaurants in Italian areas back east then run as fast as possible away from this establishment.  By the way, this was $37 each even though we split an appetizer and had no drinks other than tap water. It was a horrible waste of money. This is definitely not a $$ place if you are ordering a meal. I guess it fits the bill if ordering a pizza."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner place! Delicious food great outdoor seating, good service. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I hope I could give ZERO star!! The service is horrible. My friends and I have a flight to catch so we were sit on the bar to avoid the 45 min wait. We got the menu and everything and were excited about the food. Then the manager came to us and kicked us out. He said there was no server to serve us at the bar. Why would they seat us in the first place and then kick us out?! The service management is truly horrible. Which business does that???"}
{"text":"3 1/2.  Pros: Good service Nice waiters Dishes have generous proportions.  Two people could split one seafood special. Yummy soft bread smothered in garlic.  Sooooo good.   Con: Pricey.  The dishes aren't worth the price.  It's good food but not THAT good. For a family of 4 it was $160. Crazy. We all got pastas. No drinks.  I feel like the seafood quality should be a little better but that's just me. I'm picky with that cus my parents have a sushi restaurant.  So i like the fresh stuff.  And for the price i wish they would make fresh pasta.."}
{"text":"Tried to make a reservation... Called to get some information first. Spoke with a hostess named Kendra. She was very rude. Not helpful. She had an attitude the entire time and before I got to finish asking  a question she hung up on. She was so unprofessional I could hear her talking to other customers in the background as she was suppose to be helping me get a reservation. when I called back she put me on hold and had me talk to another hostess. I ended up not even making a reservation because of this."}
{"text":"The garlic knots are so delicious!! Clams with linguine lacked luster, but the pizzas were pretty good. I like the atmosphere and the convenient location. There is a cute outdoor patio and paper table covers so you could color/draw during your meal; I thought that was a nice touch. Seriously though, I must repeat myself, the garlic knots are pretty insane."}
{"text":"I went here based on the 4 star rating.  The service was ok, but the food was below average.  They had plenty of empty tables visible but still made us wait 20 minutes for one of them.    I ordered the linguine bolagnese and it was not good.  Noodles a bit under cooked and the ragu was very average.    The rolls were good, but they arrived cold.  The salad dressing was too vinegary.     Definitely not worth what they charge per plate."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving Italian, so we made a special trip here after reading the great reviews. Before writing this, I actually pulled up the photos to make sure we'd eaten at the right place!  We arrived at 8 and found a wait of about 15-20 minutes (after calling about 30 minutes earlier to inquire about the wait and make a reservation and being told we would have no problem being seated); oh well, not a big deal. We went next door to the magic shop and returned at 8:05 to the four parties or so waiting next to the host. The two parties in front of us were still planted inches from the host (including another party of two that had been waiting when we first arrived). As we stood there, we saw two people walk up to an empty table that had just been cleared. The host hurried up to the party and told them that the table hadn't been bused but there was a table in the back that had been and he led them to it. WTH?!  Clearly, this annoyed those of us waiting in line. After seeing this, a party of two that was AFTER us on the list rushed to the host and demanded to be seated. And they were. Just like that. My husband talks to the host and of course we are blamed because he called our name and we didn't answer. Hmm, so he called our name within 5 minutes of us arriving (after JUST estimating that the wait would be 15-20 minutes), ignored the fact we'd been making active eye contact with him since, and somehow he called our name before he called the parties of the same size immediately in front of us in line. Right. Dude, no sympathy for the fact I've been waiting patiently with a big pregnant belly?  For some reason, we stayed and the host did apologize for the wait when he finally seated us--but not for being unfair and likely dishonest about calling us. The garlic rolls were tough and bland except for the topping. The service was polite, rushed. We saw our waiter a few brief times. The gnocchi itself was very good; the pesto lacked bite. The meatballs were the highlight.   Overall, a disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Vegas. Everything was fresh and the service was incredible. The waiters were these two Italian guys. Hilarious!  This is our new regular stop when we're in town. My wife loved it so much she gave the waiter a hug!"}
{"text":"I signed up for a Yelp account just so I could review this restaurant. Best Italian food I've ever had besides my Grama's. I'm so upset that its in Vegas and I can't eat there everyday. ( I tried to get them to let me live there in exchange for free food, they said they'd think about it.....) We had the Caesar salad, spaghetti & meatballs, their garlic rolls and our friends had the warm spinach salad, every single thing was amazing. The server/owner Domenico was adorable and so nice. He called my friend signorina and she blushed and giggled like a little girl. My only disappointment was that I found it on the last day and we only got to eat there once. Can't wait to get back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended from a family member and did not disappoint. The food was authentic Italian. Reasonably priced. And DELICIOUS! The service was so sweet. Upon making our reservations, we mentioned it was our anniversary and got a free cannoli! The only downfall is it's in the mall area of the Venetian, so not as secluded  as I'd like, but still worth it. If you're looking for good food at the right price, then def visit!"}
{"text":"It is the best pasta I would recommend everybody thank you so much they have the best service They have the best dessert thank you again I will come again I will tell all my family and my friends"}
{"text":"My family decided to eat out this Sunday. We yelped Italian restaurants and saw the four stars so decided to give it a try. The restaurant was clean and the staff were attentive.  The restaurant was not busy(maybe a third full). The food had little to be desired.  The food was no better than the popular Italian chain--they even use the same boxed pasta! We started with calamari which were rubbery and greasy and served with an odd colored \"red\" sauce that was actually orange. I had tortellini with Alfredo sauce which was melted butter mixed with cream and very watery. No herbs or flavor whatsoever.  The tortellini was not house made and over cooked to boot! They were happy to take my tortellini and remake something else but after eating a stick of watery butter from my first bite, I lost my appetite.  My husband ordered veal parmigiana but the waiter brought some odd fried meat with a salad on the top!  Oops. My son ordered chicken parmigiana.  He said it was ok. We were out for a family meal and my son ended up eating alone while my husband and I watched.  Right about the time my son finished eating his meal my husbands actual order came so we got to watch him eat.  Not exactly the family dinner we had in mind.  Very pricey for \"chain\" quality food.  I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I wish there was less than 1 start to give to this place.  \"Very rude management,\" that pretty much summarizes the experience you should expect there."}
{"text":"This is a nice Italian restaurant in Downtown Sumerlin. I have eaten here at least 6 times since they opened. Sometimes it's just me and my wife, and other times with our (grown) kids. When it's just the two of us, we usually start with the calamari. I'm not a big fan of calamari, but at this restaurant, I make an exception. I've tried the calamari at Red Lobster, and thought I was chewing a pencil eraser. The calamari here was better than any other I have tried. I actually finished the large portion (I did have help from my wife).  If we go with the kids, we will oder the antipasto platter. Yes, it is pricey, but it's a generous size, and the quality of the meats is first rate. I'm pretty sure the prosciutto is imported from Italy.    For my main course, I seem to be stuck on the salmon. I really like their spaghetti with meat sauce, and the veal parm is awesome, but the salmon does it for me.  It is always tender, juicy, and flavorful.  It even tastes good the next day for lunch, when I can't finish it at the restaurant because I ate too much calamari or antipasto.  Oh yeah, if you have room, the carrot cake is awesome. Get three or four friends to help you finish it.    I see in a couple of reviews people were complaining about slow service. In all the times I've been here, I have not had that experience.  The staff was very friendly, and the service was professional.  Obviously if the joint was jumping, like on a Friday or Saturday night, it takes a little longer for food to arrive, but that's how it is at any busy restaurant.     Do yourself a favor, next time you have a taste for Italian food, and you're near Summerlin, check out this place.  They have indoor, and covered outdoor seating.  It's a great location to \"people watch\" while you are enjoying a drink and a great meal."}
{"text":"Ask for lyndsay to serve you great service. Great food  a must eat place. Good atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas. Since my last visit about a year ago they have expanded their business to the unit next to them -- business must be good and I can see why. They make one of the best if not the best meatballs. Really no lie! Their meatballs are consistently soft, plump and tasty. I have yet to find another Italian restaurant that makes better meatballs. Good decor and ambiance -- felt cozy inside with opera like music playing in the background. Clean restaurant and attentive servers were a plus. Other dishes (Caesar salad, pizza, etc) were good, too, but I go there for the spaghetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"My husband and I were vacationing in Vegas and our friends said don't leave Vegas without going to Trattoria Reggiano.  We trust them so off we went for lunch today.  Our waitress, Ricki was so friendly and helpful  we asked for her recommendation.  I had soup and my husband had lobster ravioli. OMG food was fantastic but Ricki made our meal extra special.  Besides being helpful with our food choices she is friendly and never got annoyed with our numerous questions.  When we were ready to leave we hugged Ricki, by then we felt like she was family.  We will recommend this restaurant to everyone who goes to Vegas and it is a must to have Ricki as their server.  We will be back.  Ricki is a definite asset to this business and deserves kudos."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner while we were staying at the Venetian. My thoughts:  - The place is really small - probably 6-7 tables inside the restaurant and another 7 or so in the mall just outside the restaurant (still indoors). But I liked the feel, it's a cute place.  - Our waiter was great. I asked for a wine suggestion and he gave it to me. It was a house wine, nothing amazing, but I did like it better than the cab that my friend got, which was my alternative, so that marks it as a positive. He also joked with us, was very nice and courteous, just all-around good service.  - The food was very good. Granted, I was really hungry, so part of the satisfaction was certainly just getting food in my stomach. My friend got the chicken francese and I got the baked ziti. We semi-shared (I gave her a 1/4 of mine and she gave me a 1/4 of hers). I enjoyed both dishes, although maybe the baked ziti a bit more than the chicken.  Overall, I would recommend this place. Definitely convenient if you're staying in the Venetian or Palazzo."}
{"text":"Went here on a friday night at 8:00. There were a few tables open so the 2 of us got seated right away. Our waiter, an older gentleman, was funny and friendly. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and my fiancé ordered pesto gnocchi. Both dishes were good but the spaghetti was definitely better than the gnocchi. The garlic bread balls were so yummy so we asked for more and finished it all! As the night continued all the tables got filled and there was a line of people waiting. Our waiter seemed a little flustered and didn't give us as much attention. At the end of the meal when things calmed down he was back to his usual self. Overall we had a delicious meal for a decent price. This is a great place and we will be back when we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I prefer other foods than Italian. Pizza is pretty much the most Italian I'll ever eat. I thought pizza is oh well another pizza  But oh no !!!. The pizza I had was outstanding   It's the Quattro Stagioni. Ummm. Yummy.  Ingredients were fresh. Crust perfect.  Our waiter Wyatt  (and no his last name is not Earp) was very attentive. Overall, am visiting AGAIN !!!   Grace & Pete"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight with my son, and I must say I was not pleased. I ordered gluten free pasta with chicken and no butter. The waiter said that the chicken was going to be dry. I said that I would rather have it be dry than to get sick from all the oil and dairy. When the food came, I was surprised to find out that my chicken was breaded. I don't understand why they would give me breaded chicken with gluten free pasta. The waiter never came back after that, so I tried to take off the bread unsuccessfully and ended up giving the rest of my chicken to my son. He got the linguine with shrimp pasta with a watered down sauce that he said was disgusting. $85 later, I feel like I was robbed and have a stomach ache. I wonder if that pasta was really gluten free. My recommendation is that you don't go here and go to the many other places around."}
{"text":"Very good food and service at reasonable prices for a Vegas hotel restaurant.  House wine was very drinkable.  Food quality was excellent.  Very good, properly prepared pasta.  Wonderful service.  The reason for only 4 stars is that the restaurant is hard to find in the labyrinth of the Venetian hotel, which was frustrating.  Parking is free in the hotel lot."}
{"text":"This place is so f*ing good.  Yes I have been to Italy multiple times and enjoyed the amazingly cooked pasta and pizza there and yes 99% of restaurant in America screw it up.  Pasta is supposed to be al dente ok?  Well yes the pasta here was cooked perfectly and the sauce so tasty.  The bread is garlicy just the way I like it dripped in olive oil. I heard the manager or owner speaking Italian which explains the authentic dishes.  The only draw back the tiramisu was just ok"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is a must try. Food was delicious and the garlic bread was great. My dad can't stop raving about the salmon dish. But it was the service that will bring us back!! Eric our server was great! Very attentive and pleasant. My son accidentally spilled my drink and they were there in a flash to help clean up, prepare a new table setting and refresh all our drinks. They really made the night special. Come eat here and be sure to ask for Eric. Dora the manager is also soooo amazing. She was there in a flash to make sure all was ok after the spilled drink. She was nice and talked to us. With the million places to eat on the strip these people really know how to make your experience special."}
{"text":"Excellent service and staff!! And some of the best pizza you can find in Vegas!! Will come back here every time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"You must try this restaurant! Four of us each had something different and everything was amazing. Be sure to  try the Filet Mignon Meatballs and the Caprese salad as appetizer.   For the main course we covered everything from chicken, veal to pasta and none of us were disappointed. Everything was  fresh and delicious.  Now dessert....try it all.  I had the best Canoli I've ever had and trust me I've had plenty of them in NY and Italy. My friends raved about the Tiramisu and the Cheesecake.  Now to the service...if I could give more stars I would. The waitresses and manager were very attentive and friendly. Thanks Amanda, Riley and Stefano.  I was there five days and had lunch/dinner there three times!   Be sure to check it out"}
{"text":"Superb food and even better service. Paolo was our server and he's brilliant. The other staff was very good too, the ladies who served us drinks too.   They served us bread while we waited for our food and it was yum. Covered with Parmesan cheese, buttery.  We ordered fried calamari, gnocchi with red sauce and spaghetti meatballs. The portions were huge and food was very very tasty. Loved the place. Absolutely brilliant."}
{"text":"This restaurant was average at best. Pasta from a box, oil pooling at the bottom of my dish, nothing seasoned well...save your money."}
{"text":"Came here based on the good reviews, and the meal was just average. The garlic knots were cold. My boyfriend had the pesto gnocchi, it was a good portion. I ordered the lobster ravioli and I've had better at berrys in Beverly Hills. The meatball was 80% filet and 20% pork, my friend said it tasted a bit weird. Plenty of other choices in Vegas, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"I have found heaven on earth.  There are not enough adjectives to describe the amazing meal my friend and I had last night.  If you are looking for a TASTY gluten free pizza look no further. I have tried endless gluten free choices for pizza and this was by far the BEST I've ever had!   We also had the filet mignon meatballs which were RIDICULOUS and the eggplant rollatini melted in your mouth.  Finally an Italian place in Summerlin that brings you back to New York Italian.  Yummmm!  Can't wait to go back and try more.  My neighbor was eating penne Alla vodka and RAVED about it so that is next!   Oh and did I mention the staff was friendly and service was thumbs up!   Located right next to movie theatre in downtown Summerlin! Thank you Trattoria!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time dining here and we were impressed with the service. Everyone was very friendly and efficient and they took excellent care of us even though it was a busy evening. The calamari was excellent. The baked clams were very good. The Caesar salad was good as was the lasagne. The lobster ravioli was the only thing that didn't live up to its billing. All and all it was a nice evening and if you are in the mood for Italian it is worth trying."}
{"text":"No wait on a Sunday afternoon.  Expect to wait if you go on Friday or Saturday night (I tried once before and was told 1 hour wait .... no thanks).  Great selection of Italian dishes.  I had the lobster ravioli and wife had the linguini and claims.  Both were very good.   The flavors were very authentic. Lots of claims.  Also had the espresso martini that was well prepared (not too strong on the alcohol and a good espresso flavor)  Another big thing with this restaurant are the complementary garlic knots.  They are great.  They have olive oil and vinegar on the table, but some butter might also be nice.  Also, when we got our first batch, they were very cold and I mentioned this to the waitress who said \"Ohh, they just came out.  So do you want a new one?\"  Yeah, right -- they just came out (15 minutes ago).  Nice try.  The correct response is -- \"I'm sorry, I'll get you a fresh batch right away.\"  But they were replaced with a hot fresh batch about 3 minutes later.  In fact, if I had any complaint, I would say that our server was not the most attentive (took a while to bring drinks, took a while to bring the bread, the aforementioned breach comment).  The other complaint was the prices -- almost $70 for lunch for two with no dessert and one martini drink (including tip).  A bit pricey, but this is appears to be the new norm in the bourgeois downtown Summerlin area, so I guess its to be expected.    The dessert tray looked good (and I would like to try the TIramisu) but I was full so will have to be next time.  Anyway, I will definitely go back and try out some other things."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant the day we checked into The Venetian.  The meal was so good we returned again the next day.  The service was wonderful both nights.  The food was delicious and worth every penny.  You could tell they use only the freshest ingredients.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had a group of 10 celebrating birthdays. Staff was attentive and professional. Food was really excellent.  Reasonably priced, too."}
{"text":"Food was medico at best, and the service was terrible. Sat for 20mins with no drink refills, and the meatballs taste like they were baked in the morning then microwaved for the lunch crowd. Not worth it..."}
{"text":"Speechless. I don't ever write reviews. This food made me write one. I mentioned I was craving Italian sausage and he made me something not on the menu. It was the best pasta dish I have ever had."}
{"text":"10/27/16 Lunch. This is a quaint place.  The food was really good and we shared family style.  They start you off with freshly baked garlic bread - oh so garlicky and buttery.  I could eat the bread alone as my meal.  We ordered the Pasta e Fagioli Soup, Filet Mignon Meatball, and Linguini Carbonara.  The soup was hearty.  The meatball was moist and had enough sauce.  I really liked the Linguini Carbonara because the pasta was al dente and the sauce was creamy but not heavy.  The Italian Sangria was OK.  We also had the Ricotta Cheesecake for dessert and this was delicious.  This restaurant is good for families and I would dine here for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is good, the ambiance is mall-like.   Had the spaghetti and mignon meatballs. Very tasty! Perfect portions, it's nice that they don't overload you with food since leftovers don't really work in Vegas when you're on vacation.  I thought the pricing was good, too."}
{"text":"We eat here every time we are in town. The food is authentic and delicious. The staff is attentive to every last detail. They remember us each time, especially Dora who is wonderful. We just dined here again last night and once again had a terrific experience. All of the pasta options are amazing and so is the pizza!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was the highlight of our weekend in Vegas. The caprese saiad with burrata cheese was spot on. My wife (who is Italian and makes homemade sauce (or \"gravy\" as they call it) loved her spaghetti carbonara. I ordered the veal parmesean and the portion was HUGE. I only planned on eating half of it, but due to it being so good (combined with a weakness I have of overeating) resulting in me eating the whole thing without even realizing it. Our server was very friendly and attentive and if you are ok with the restaurant's location / relaxed atmosphere (that other reviewers capture quite nicely), this one exceeded the expectations of someone that cooks with family Iitalian recipes, and let me tell you, THAT is tough to do!"}
{"text":"My family keeps coming back to this wonderful restaurant.   Vito is the best host.  The food is  top notch made from quality  ingredients.  Generous servings.  Excellent service.  Very comfortable  setting."}
{"text":"The worst, over priced, and the kind of service that belongs at a truck stop. Was man handled by a waiter with a attitude like he just caught his wife in bed with his brother. Ordered baked clams that were thrown on the table as was the rest of the dishes like a set of dice and tasted like oiled bread. The shrimp scampi was so salty I drank a gallon of water over a two hour period. The shrimp was hard, rubbery, and chewy. Dropped a $100 bill on that miserable experience. BEWARE !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. The food and ambiance are fantastic! We usually eat at the bar, No need to even look at a drink menu...we just ask Eli to make us something delicious...and he always comes through with an amazing concoction!!!!!"}
{"text":"The bottom line: as far as I could tell this is actually an authentic family joint. The food is basic Italian food. Nothing to write home about, however not bad.  The pros: the service was very friendly, professional, and quick. They made an effort to seat us despite being quite busy. As everybody before us has noted, we also agree that the garlic bread is really tasty. Perhaps too tasty :)  The cons: I've had better Italian food. I had the eggplant Parmesan which was mediocre and much too cheesy for my liking. Another person in our party had pesto gnocchi, which was good but not exciting whatsoever. The Caesar salad was okay, but there were quite a few hidden calories in the amount of dressing. On the upside the anchovy dressing was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ordered the meatball app and arugala and cherry tomato salad.  The meatballs tasted good but they were served barely warm in the middle.  The plate was cold and the sauce was room temp.  Disappointing.  Salad was good."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience. Came here with my family for lunch. The food was amazing. The appetizers mussels, calamari and eggplant rollatini were delicious. Chicken franchise was cooked to perfection. The desserts tiramisu, cannolis and chocolate cake were unbelievable. Our waiter Giovanni was the best. If you are looking for great Italian food and a warm and inviting place to dine I highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"We would give this a 4 out of 5 stars. Our first restaurant in Vegas was a great experience. They forgot to bring out the bottles of olive oil and baslmic but made up for it for with extra attention. No big deal, just glad we had a good time!"}
{"text":"The reason we went it was because the waiter was friendly and allowing my dog to sit with us outside.  We ordered pizza, it came out buried,  the garlic knots  were  too greasy for us..  The coffee were like hot water, no coffee taste at all. The spaghetti with meatball is nothing to get excited.  The only thing good about this is allowing my dog to sat with us."}
{"text":"A small quaint little Italian restaurant. The prices, wine, and food were outstanding!! I thoroughly enjoyed dinner at this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Great service, great pies, great chix Parmesan and damn fine wine and a doppio.   Loved it."}
{"text":"2.5/5.  Atmosphere was great, bread was DELISH, service was abysmal.  I couldn't hate on the entrée though but our meal was over $100.  Good experience but not worth going back to."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner.   Started off with garlic rolls were good.  Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic vinegar were provided on the table for dipping.  The Balsamic vinegar was sweeter and not as acrid as the one from DOCG.  I accompanied my meal with a Moretti, an Italian beer and really liking this over Peroni.  There is less of an aftertaste and more pleasing to my palate.  Ordered the Linguine Carbonara.  I wanted to taste it so I have a reference of how it should taste.  Most comments online say why order it when you can just make it at home.  They are correct.   Most restaurants serve carbonara but they often add heavy cream and a whole bunch of other items.  Trattoria Reggiano was the only one I found that serves it how it is should to be, Pancetta, Cheese, Egg, and Pasta, that's it.  Overall, the taste was close to how I make it so I'm glad I'm in the general vicinity.  The criticism I have though is that they a used a little too much pancetta and the sauce could have been a little looser.  Additionally, there was little or no black pepper.  Should have asked for freshly cracked black pepper but instead used black pepper on the table, which didn't add much.  My friend had the Chicken Marsala.  It was very good.  The dish overall was not greasy.  The sauce had a lot of flavor.  Unlike a lot of Chicken Marsala we get in Hawaii where they use too much butter/oil where it masks the Marsala and chicken flavors.  Regarding they other parts of the meal, service was ok.  It lacked in the beginning but picked up later on.  Didn't really care to eat outside in the mall as the tables were too close to each other.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for simply Italian food."}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT IS AMAZING! Great, authentic Italian food and hospitality as well. It definitely is a hole in the wall, it took our group a while to find it because it's so small! The owner is a very nice, cheerful Italian man who makes you feel right at home. Their complimentary bread rolls are just...I don't know, they're just beyond delicious. Smothered in garlic and full of flavor, plus they were unlimited (not sure if they usually are, but we had a rather large group of 10+) so we definitely took some back to the hotel with us. Our entrees were great as well, truly delectable. You really cannot beat authentic Italian food, the dishes are cooked with care. I was beyond satisfied with my meal, and we left a hearty tip. Will definitely go here again when I vacation in Vegas again :)"}
{"text":"After a reply from restaurant, I decided to give them another try.  Last night had a very enjoyable dinner.  The food was very good and they have a great kids menu. I will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"I know I'm a pizza snob coming fron NY area but this pizza (with burrata)is outstanding!  Cooked purfectly with fresh ingredients.  We tried it a few days ago and wanted it again before we left. Service great and prices reasonable.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Nice little Italian restaurant in the Venetian. A little bit hard to find as it is tucked behind the food court and surrounded by a couple of other restaurants. Made reservations last minute for 6:30 and was happy that they could accommodate my party of 4 at such short notice. We were able to get a table on the outside of that restaurant that gives a view of the Grand Canal Shoppes. The place itself is a bit noisy with the open kitchen and the foot traffic around the restaurant.   First off, they provide the table with garlic knots. Very aromatic and fresh and warm and soft when I pulled it apart. Very happy that they give it to us complimentary. For appetizers, we ordered the calamari to share. Nice light batter on the calamari so it wasn't too heavy of an appetizer. For the entrees, I had the penne a la vodka. The rest of my party had the chicken parm, linguine with clams, and shrimp scampi. Let me start of by saying that penna a la vodka is my favorite pasta dish so maybe my expectations are too high. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the pasta as it was decent but the sauce wasn't as thick and creamy as I am usually used to. There wasn't that much sauce to cover all the pasta and the sauce was a little watery. The rest of the dishes were alright as well but not the best we have had.  On a side note, our waiter was very nice and made jokes throughout the night, which was entertaining and appreciated. He seemed to really love his job. Also on top of the tablecloths, they put a sheet of paper (I'm guessing to keep the tablecloths clean) and provided the table with crayons, which was nice to pass the time as we waited for our food.  Really good garlic knots but other than that your average Italian restaurant. Nothing terrible but nothing superb on the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place last night,July 26 for our anniversary since we live close by and both love Italian food. We went in at around 8:45 and were seated immediately and were told that they close at 10- which is fine.   Our night quickly turned when we met our waitress. She was extremely rude and was reluctant to answer any of our questions. When I asked \"what is the difference between a small Caesar salad and a large?\" She rolled her eyes and said a small is a small and a large is a large.\"As if we didn't already know that. So then I asked another question, \"is a small salad enough for two people to share?\" To which she replied, \"it depends on your appetite.\" ABSOLUTELY NO HELP AT ALL. So we ordered the small Caesar to share and the portion was so small my boyfriend just told me to have it. After this our waitress didn't check in at our table one time. She walked past and would say \"is everything ok?\" But wouldn't even stop walking to hear our answers.  This type of behavior would be somewhat understandable if they were busy but we were one of only three tables in the restaurant!   I could go on and on about how rude our waitress was but I think that about sums it up. I will say this however, at the end of our meal when we asked for boxes, she boxed up my boyfriends food and I boxed up my own, which I didn't mind. My boyfriend took his left over baked ziti with meatballs to work with him today and guess what? The waitress didn't put the meatballs in the to go container.  After paying the high prices of the entrees and wanting to take some home one would assume you would get everything you paid for in the to go container but apparently not.    We went here to celebrate what should have been a great night, but our service was so poor, half way through the meal both of us were upset.   I am in the food industry as a waitress and I usually don't write yelp reviews like this but this was the WORST dining experience I have ever had in my life.   I did give two stars however because the food was good, and the hostess and busser staff were very friendly. But our experience was so sour we will never be back."}
{"text":"In Vegas for the weekend with my wife, we decided on some Italian after eating steak and lamb first few nights. We found this little place in the shopping center of the Venetian. Extremely happy with our selection, out server, Paolo, and our food, were more than what we had hoped for. I would recommend this place for the food and decent pricing!"}
{"text":"Had the Shrimp Scampi and loved it!  Great environment and the staff was wonderful. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Ok.  My friend raved about this spot and how she gets it every single time she's in Vegas but I thought it was just okay.  We went for lunch and we were the only 3 people at the restaurant at the time.  It did slowly start filling up since it's a pretty small spot.  I ordered the special, which was a sausage rigatoni.  Nothing special.  It was your standard italian food.  I may come back and try something different if I'm around the Venetian/Palazzo."}
{"text":"Save yourself and eat somewhere else while you're in Vegas.The food was really mediocre. It tasted like mall food court food yuck.   The service sucked, and the seating is awkward you sit outside amongst all the venetian shoppers.  The only good thing was the garlic bread"}

{"text":"I just finished reading a review of an incident at this restaurant on 8/10/15 written by someone patting himself on the back and being untruthful about what happened.  My family and I eat here quite often.  We love the food and the service.  I don't know what place the writer was in but this restaurant doesn't have 15 people working on any shift.  When the lady fell, the bartender (who was an EMT) immediately rushed to her.  At the same time, one of the servers was doing exactly what she should by calling mall security.  The \"gentleman\" really didn't have to do anything since the staff was very knowledgeable about the appropriate actions to take and took them.   I very seldom write anything on Yelp, but I do read reviews of places we want to try.  It really bothers me when someone writes inaccurate reviews.  That is not to say that things can't be wrong at times with food and service. However, let's at least be honest.  The food at this restaurant is not New York Italian, but rather, true Italian from Italy.  It is authentic and excellent.  The servers, bartenders, and manager are always helpful, polite, and accommodating.    I have tried to correct an injustice by explaining the event and stating our enjoyment every time we dine here."}
{"text":"Sorta disappointed after all the good reviews.  I'm hoping they only had an \"off\" night but the service seemed disorganized and slow.  In fact the tables being seating next to us noticed our discomfort and asked if they should leave or stay.  The food was decent so I recommended they stay, although I don't think it was anywhere worth the large bill.  Doubt I'll return next time I'm in Vegas.    I will say that the hostess and waiter were very friendly, but it seemed they were short staffed or suffering from problems in the kitchen.  But they never explained or apologized, just acted like everything was okay.  A bit of honesty with their situation would have made me feel a lot more sympathetic.  Hopefully others have a better experience."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best food we had while in Vegas!  Mind blowing garlic bread, pizza, and cannoli.  We also tried the eggplant appetizer, which was both unique and delicious.  The eggplant was pounded very thin and wrapped around a bit of cheese, all topped off with a vodka creme sauce and fresh parm. Typing this is seriously making me salivate... Anyway, it was the first restaurant we tried while staying at the Venetian and we should have just eaten there the whole weekend.  It couldn't get better.  The service was also fantastic.  Our server was very attentive and went above and beyond to make our dining experience enjoyable.  They were out of chocolate chips to sprinkle on the cannoli so she offered to go to Haagen Dazs to get us some!"}
{"text":"I came here with my parents for dinner. We REALLY liked the complimentary bread they started us off with. It was garlicky and slightly cheesy, rather buttery - absolutely delicious. I wish I spent more time on the bread as that was my favourite thing during dinner. We ordered 3 dishes to share: carbonara, chicken marsala, and the Arugula & Gorgonzola pizza. Everything was pretty good, but it kind of paled in comparison to the bread."}
{"text":"A bit difficult to find but MAKE the effort - ask directions if needed! Pasta primervera was fresh and light, linguine carbonara was fabulous, so were the meatballs. Save room for dessert though tiramisu & homemade cannoli are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give 3.5 if available, but I'm feeling generous so I'll round up.    4 of us went for a Saturday night dinner.  We had reservations for 7:30 and they seated us immediately.  Restaurant was clean, staff was about as friendly as you could reasonably expect with a packed house on a hot Vegas night.   Here are a few, admittedly minor, critiques. - our waiter was an older gentleman, with a thick, we thought possibly added on and emphasized for 'authenticity' accent.  He clearly struggled with the whole placing the order via iPad thing, especially when one in the party ordered something he wasn't familiar with (but was on the menu and no changes were requested).  - The pasta e fagioli was certainly nothing to remember, which is disappointing with the 'we're in DTS so we can overcharge' pricepoint on all the dishes. - and one of my pet peeves, they didn't bring all the entrees out at the same time.  They brought three and one in the party had to wait for a while until theirs arrived.    Not sure if I'll go back.  Food was solid (save the soup), but the price was rather high for what you get and there are better Italian options in town."}
{"text":"First time here and had a wonderful experience. We sat at the bar and Bethany was our bartender. Service was spot on. We started with a couple glasses of red wine recommended by Bethany. They were exactly what we were looking for. We only wanted an appetizer to share and Bethany recommended the meatballs. This was a good choice as the meat was flavorful and the pomodoro sauce was divine. At 7pm the live music started and it was a great touch. Hi quality lounge music I would call it.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food and service was good.   The atmosphere was nil for the tables were too close together and most of the tables were out in the Venetian mall.  My main gripe is that the meal and one drink for the two of us was $100.00. I think a $$$ dollar rating would be more appropriate for the Trattoria."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The pastas are delicious. There was a spaghetti with this wonderful garlic sauce, roasted peppers and, roasted garlic. The pizzas are wonderful as well."}
{"text":"OK, I've eaten here twice now.  The first time was about two years ago, and I remember my entree as being very tasty and worth a second visit.  The second time was last week, and my entree this time was just okay.  Nothing special.  However....I have to rave about their caprese salad with imported mozarella cheese.  It was awesome!  My wife and I just returned from a two-week Italy tour, and we ate all Italian food and drank a lot of Italian wine.  We had our share of caprese salads, and I tell you, Trattoria Reggiano's caprese salad is as good, or better, than those served in Italy!  It is worth recommending.  They use imported buffalo mozarella, and it is wonderfully delicious.  You must try it, even if you're so-so on tomatoes.  The combination is terrific and not to be missed.  As for an entree, I would suggest maybe ordering something with a sauce other than tomato based.  Their pasta is very good al dente; I just think a sauce other than tomato-based gives more suble taste and texture back to the pasta dish itself.  Next time I'm here I'll try the veal.    Do not be dissuaded from trying this Trattoria from the setting.  Yes, it is in a hotel mall next to a magic shop and a Coffee Bean, but the food is good and it is run by genuine Italians.  Not as expensive as the numerous famous chefs' restaurants at the Venetian Hotel, not in as nice a setting, but the proof is in the pasta and sauces. Give it a go; I don't think you'll regret it.  Sit \"outside\" and people-watch.  And don't forget the Caprese Salad!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny and doesn't look much from the outside but check it out. I live in New Jersey where good Italian restaurants are common so the bar is set pretty high. We went with a group of 6 people and we all loved it. The food was great and the service was even better. The price is reasonable too! It's a go to spot on my next trip."}
{"text":"Average food, pompous waiter, poor service and overpriced.  A small cheese pizza and three meat balls came to $31.  The waiter never smiled, he seemed to look down on us when we ordered three waters (but he only gave us two), not once checked on us and no pre-bussing.  I wish I could say the food made up for it but it didn't.  The garlic rolls that everyone was raving about were comparable to doughy dinner rolls.  The food was nice but that's about it.  Bummer.  Oh, the quickest the waiter got to our table was when we stood up and he rushed to see what his tip was; that time the bummer was his.  I think the economy brought him out of retirement."}
{"text":"Best Italian food west of the Atlantic.  I go every time I'm in Vegas.  The tortellini Alfredo is one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  The staff & atmosphere are great too.  No trip to Las Vegas is complete without dinner at Trattoria Reggiano"}
{"text":"Trattoria Reggiano must have taken note of my critical review. In my three times being back at this establishment since my less than exceptional first experience, I have found that the service, food, and ambiance has improved tremendously. This location has gone from one that I nearly disdained, to one that I recommend to colleagues without hesitation. The unprecedented turnaround that this fantastic restaurant underwent is nothing short of astounding, and I look forward to enjoying the impressive Trattoria Reggiano for a long time.   (P.S.) My Reccomendations:  1st Course: Calamari 2nd Course: Chicken Francese or Veal Milanese  3rd Course: Tiramasu"}
{"text":"Maybe our mistake was eating close to closing time 10pm on a week day. Our 60 something Italian male waiter with a heavy accent seem to care less if we were there or not. When I asked how large the pizza was he seemed insulted like, \"what a stupid question, they are10 inches, not enough for two people\" he said. Wrong it turned out the pizza is more like 14 inches plenty enough for a late snack for two. This waiter who could have been the owner or manager was unfriendly.rushed, and worse, uncaring. He could care less if we enjoyed ourselves or not. My bill was $38.50 for one dull over cooked pizza and 2 drinks. $8 for a beer $11 for a glass of wine. When he returned my change he couldn't be bothered with returning my 1.50 so he just skipped the .50 change and left a dollar bill. Remember we hadn't said as much as a word or 2 to this guy and somehow he just didn't like us. My suggestion take your Vegas dollars elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Having attended Rock of Ages at the Venetian, we were looking for the best Italian restaurant within walking distance. We did our research and hit the jackpot.  The restaurant is currently being remodeled/expanded and so we sat outside along the mall walkway. This was great for people watching.  The rolls are hefty, buttery, garlicky and delicious. But the real reason to come is the authentic and fabulous Italian food.   The filet meatballs are as awesome as advertised and worth the price of admission. The chicken parmesan and lobster ravioli were fabulous.  If there is better Italian food in Vegas, I would be suprised."}
{"text":"My first time here, food was delicious! I recommend this place, if you want real Italian food. Love it..."}
{"text":"omg..this place is awesome ..great food .entertainment... Betheny the bartender ...is frickin awesome...love this place ."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place..the staff is friendly..always attentive...Bethany the bartender is always keeping my drink full...Ricky and Hilda are great.the food is terrific..made just the way it was supposed to be made..hot and delicious..they have great live music in weekends..si incredibly fun..youll love this place..go..go now"}
{"text":"My brother and I were in Vegas on vacations, and after a long day of walking, we craved some good old pasta for dinner. We saw many places while exploring the Strip, but I went to Yelp to get more options. After reading the reviews for this place, we decided to give it a try. Boy, the reviews were right! The garlic rolls were amazing. We ordered the lasagna and a four cheeses pizza, and everything was flavorful and delicious. Food quality and service were great, and prices were very reasonable. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It was my first trip to Vegas and of the 4 days, this restaurant was the #1 most disappointing part of the trip. PLEASE go to a different restaurant.  4 girls total who ordered similar things: 3 girls ordered the linguine and replaced the clams with shrimp. ($24)  I personally ordered the agio e olio ($14) and added shrimp (+$6) - it was embarrassingly horrible. Oil was splattered to try and mask the low-quality, dry pasta. Even an attempt to make the dish tolerable by adding spices did not work at all. It was beyond disappointing.   The other 3 dishes were just as dry. One of the girls ordered Alfredo sauce as a replacement to the original and let's just say, they all looked the same.  None of us finished.  Our conversations at the table consisted on how much better we could have made pasta, and how awful our waiter was. While asking for drink options, we merely said water. To which he asked sparkling or regular. We said regular and that was it. He brings out a bottle and slaps on a $19 charge for 2 bottles water. Of course we complained and got that taken off, but we should have also complained about our food. That was one of our biggest regrets.   All in all: do NOT come here. There are SO many better restaurants. Even across the restaurant is a much better looking restaurant. Please don't waste your money.  Us 4 will remember this place as the worst Italian restaurant we have all been to."}
{"text":"Found this gem thanks to Yelp and couldn't be happier about it. After reading all the reviews the one constant was garlic knots and meatballs. The reviews did not lie. I never order spaghetti and meatballs out but wow, just wow at how good those meatballs are. Also had the calamari for an appetizer which was also extremely good.   Only thing that kept it from a five star is it's small inside. Like really, really, really small. Outside of that, I don't have a complaint. Thank you Yelp for leading my wife and I to Trattoria Reggiano."}
{"text":"The complimentary bread is AMAZING! Soft, buttery, and delicious.  I ordered the linguini with white sauce and clams and the calamari. The linguini was a bit too al dente for my liking and could have been a tad bit softer, but the calamari was scrumptious. The fresh marinara sauce and the touch of lemon was perfect.    The service was superb. The waiter was attentive and friendly. They were more than willing to give me extra marinara sauce when I asked for take out boxes."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a drink while shopping. Food was great. Ricki was AWESOME!!! Best service I've had in Vegas so far. I would definitely recommend this place. Ask for Ricki"}
{"text":"I came here around 4 times and the food is amazing I tried many italian food and I am really picky about taste but  this is best among vegas italian restautants.  One thing that i did not like is Service from server.  I hope server check customer more often and give nice smile at least"}
{"text":"Very good. Service was good. Price was decent especially for being in the Venetian. I had the pasta e fagioli and arugula cherry tomato salad.  They could have used some more seasoning, but other than that very yummy, especially with the garlic bread twists that come with the meal."}
{"text":"After looking at several different dining options in and around the Palazzo, my fiancé and I chose Trattoria Reggiano for his birthday dinner. If you are looking for an intimate and romantic dining experience, this is not the place for you... But all we wanted was good Italian food, so it was fine. He had linguine carbonara, I had linguine in clam sauce. Both were very good, we we went for a cannoli for dessert. I mentioned it was fiancé's birthday (a cardinal sin) so our waiter threw a candle in the cannoli but did not embarrass him by singing.   It was about $20 a person, but good food is worth that price."}
{"text":"On my recent trip to Vegas I had a hankering for Italian food.    We decided to give Reggiano's a try after reading the reviews for casual Italian restaurants.  Maybe we were just Strip weary by the time we arrived at the Venetian, but my lord...it took us forever to find this place!  We almost gave up and went to one of the easier to find restaurants in St Mark's Square.  This place is small.  I think there were maybe 3 booths inside and the rest were tables set up in/outside the main storefront.  There wasn't really any hostess station to check-in at, just a waiter standing guard near the opening on the \"street front\".  The garlic knots were amazing! I had the bolognese and my hubby had the carbonara and both hit the spot.  The service was nothing special.  In fact, I thought the waiter here was the coldest we experienced in Vegas.  I got over that though, because the food was what I came for and it did the trick.  Casual, hearty and filling."}
{"text":"First time here and we love it. Food was great. I had the gnocchi with Alfredo and side of meatballs. Sam was our waiter and offered great service with a touch of good humor. We will come back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food was barely warm, bland chicken parmesan, service was not service, lobster ravioli had ok sauce not what I expected from all the reviews. The balsamic vinegar was the highlight! Disappointed."}
{"text":"Finding this restaurant was like finding a hidden gem.  The thing with Vegas is it's either really expensive, or really cheap, with not a whole lot in between on the strip. Trattoria Reggiano was the one place I found that was neither.  It's a very little restaurant tucked between the food court and the shopping in the Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian.  There are maybe 10 or 12 tables total.  It serves what I call Italian comfort food.  Generous pasta dishes and hearty bread served just like a neighborhood Italian restaurant in Anytown, USA.  It was $40 for two of us to eat.  We had Linguini Alfredo and Shrimp Scampi.  Both were tasty and filling.  The service was polite and non intrusive.  No back waiters, no captains, none of that; just a guy who might own the place who's happy to feed you whatever you want, and then leave you be to eat it until you want him next.  Two thumbs up for casual Italian with no fuss!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Service, food, beverages. Everything. We order a pizza and spaghetti meatballs."}
{"text":"What a find!  Salmon was fresh and cooked perfectly, mouth watering  garlic rolls , frothy cappuccino. Can't wait to go back and try riccotta pie!"}
{"text":"Eli is the best bartender in Summerlin. Creative, inventive, and gracious.  Have him create a berry grappa martini or a chocolate espresso martini for a sumptuous beginning and end. Going back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Really small place in the food court but the food is good"}
{"text":"Very disappointing for the price and given high ratings of other reviews.   Like many Italian restaurants in the US i'm pretty sure that this all came out of the Sysco wholesale food catalogue and was frozen and so just microwaved out back and dumped on our plate. Nothing was very flavoursome or fresh though all was heavily coated in butter/oil/sauce.   All pretty tasteless and for $150 for two after tip it was bad.   A simpler menu of proper/fresher food would be so much better and italian food is not that difficult or complex so why not do it. I guess it's all about money as frozen food is higher margin.   Anyone serving this food in italy to an italian would be out of business within a week."}
{"text":"We've been back to Vegas a few more times since my last review and have tried our place each time of course.  Unfortunately, things seem to go down a little bit more each time.  I didn't want to believe it at first thinking they were just having a day off, but after three subsequent not so great visits, I really have to knock down the stars from the 5 to a 3.5.  The bread used to be served hot; but now they're cold, hard even.  The last two pizzas we ordered had way burnt crusts, and adding meatballs to a dish was way way overpriced - 4 bucks EACH meatball!!!  This used to be destination eating, but now it's an \"oh if we're in the area and want italian\" place for us."}
{"text":"We went here based on reviews.  We got a Caesar salad which was to die for.  The meatballs in the baked Zito with Meatballs was to die for.  Maybe the best Italian food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Italian meal! Don't be fooled by the very small footprint. This place is absolutely fantastic! Our group had a wide variety of items from the menu and each one was better than the last. The baked ziti was incredible as were the spaghetti and meatballs. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped by this evening to enjoy some great Italian food.  However, they seemed to be in the middle of a team meeting at 6:20 on a Saturday night. There was no notice or sign about the closure so I'm not quite sure what is going on.  If you have plans on visiting tonight, you may want to call ahead!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were out for a date night.  We both had the urge for some great Italian food.  Well we found it.  We ordered the burrata, soup, chicken franchese, and linguine bolognese. Everything was delicious and reasonably priced for being in the Venetian.  Would recommend for anyone who's in the mood for some traditional Italian food.  Service was good as well"}
{"text":"I was recently in Las Vegas and my friend looked up this restaurant on yelp and it had gotten good reviews and we decided to try it....SO GLAD!  The Italian gentleman who seemed to be the owner or manager was funny and on his game.  The waiter was super fast and the food was DIVINE!  I had seen other reviews recommend eating the doodle out of the free rolls that come while you wait, and boy did we!!  The food was delicious and perfectly cooked and we were sad when we accidentally left our left-overs on the table!  So good, and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I loved it! I could totally imagine myself eating at a little restaurant like this in Italy. No wait to be seated. The waitresses were great and on top of everything. She listened and treated my wife and I very well. The food was great! I ordered Tortelloni Alfredo $15. My wife ordered Penne Primavera $14. She added shrimp $6 because the plate is pure vegetables. They also give you their homemade garlic rolls while you wait only 5-7mins for your food. We were very satisfied and could barely finish our plates.   ---5 star restaurant quality but at half the price.---  I've tried Taqueria Cañonita which is a restaurant located close to Trattoria. Their food was good but with smaller portions and double the price.   I recommend Trattoria Reggiano, unless your looking for a pricey romantic dinner next to the gandalas, then go with Taqueria Cañonita."}
{"text":"Great food and great service by great people.  Definitely a must to dine in at Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"If there was a negative star,  would have no problem giving that.  Crappy service,  poor quality of food ( infact some of us feel sick at night). Customer service is foreign to this place.  Over priced for what you get.  Please don't waste your money,  you can have a better meal at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Our server, Giovanni, was delightful. The food was great! I had the chicken parm and spaghetti. Also had the chocolate cake, the cake was very good also."}
{"text":"The appetizer bread is flavorful and good :) Kinda like chips, if you eat to many you might not have room for the main course.   Gnocchi with pesto was great.  This is my 2nd visit.  I need to leave room for the deserts next time."}
{"text":"Pizza and wine...the rest was fine. That pretty much sums up our experience. We sat at the bar and despite it not being crowded, waited quite a long time before we were acknowledged by the bartender and even then had to wait longer for him to take our order...which came out half wrong. Another couple was also waiting at the bar and ended up leaving because the bartender never helped them.   The pizza was very good and I would come back for it but I do hope the service improves."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible waiter.  Not at all helpful had to ask for water.  Took forever to get drinks.  Waiter spilled a glass of water on my friend  literally the whole glass  and later knocked into her hard barely any apology for any of it.  To make matters worse food was that great if I could give zero stars I would"}
{"text":"We got here through a show and restaurant deal.  Really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  The service was almost too attentive (the empty dishes were wooshed off the table almost the minute we took the last bite.)  It was hard to find the place but it was worth the mileage we put in to find it in the enormous complex."}
{"text":"We ordered a few dishes, everyone agreed the food was uneatable, I can not believe someone can fuck up Italian food like this, paid the bill and left all of it uneaten.  Those of you who gives 4 stars, are U insane??"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a glass of wine before our movie. We ended up having 4 glasses total, two of which were on happy hour. I will preface this by saying that I did not look specifically at the prices of the wine or the specifics of the happy hour specials. Our bill came to $60! Needless to say I was shocked. I could have gotten 4 bottles (of the same wine) at Costco for that price!! I really do love the atmosphere and have enjoyed their food in the past.  I would go back but definitely recommend checking out a corking fee or have your wine before you go!  The manager stated the pricing is related to the night rental on retail space at this complex."}
{"text":"First off the service was great.  Though it seemed forced or routine. The bread is awesome. My carbanara was ok. The price was expected for small italian restaurant inside venetian. If you're looking for no frills real italian then it's your spot otherwise I would pass."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  It is tucked away inside the shops at the Venetian (not a big place).  The meatballs are made with filet mignon and are a must have.    The baked ziti was cooked perfectly (sometimes it can be over cooked).  The lobster ravioli was very good also.  Garlic knots are brought before your meal, it's the bread they give.  Very good try not to fill up on them.    The best part of this meal was the dessert.  The cannoli was the BEST I have had outside of New York."}
{"text":"Great food and easy access from the parking structure. Take advantage of the free valet parking. Enjoy the garlic rolls. The staff was very accommodating of our toddler and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a late lunch/early dinner, nothing over the top, but not the usual 'chain' meal. Based on the reviews I read on yelp, we thought we'd give Trattoria Reggiano a go. We weren't disappointed.   Never have walked through the maze of shops within and around The Venetian, so we enjoyed the stroll to find T.R. tucked into a small curve in The Grand Canal Shoppes.  We arrived around 5:00 and had our choice of dining 'in' or 'patio' (which basically means the wide side-walk of the shoppes). We joined two other parties on the patio (it's always entertaining to people watch in Vegas!).   Warmly greeted by Amanda (who was fabulous); gave us time to look over the menu. I wasn't sure about the chianti served by the glass and she offered to get me a sample. Pleasantly surprised to find it was a nice little chianti and was poured a very full glass of wine ($11).   Hubby and I decided on a starter of Filet Mignon Meatballs ($12) since many reviews highlighted them; very good start to the meal. Good flavor, great sauce, and nicely proportioned.    For dinner, my husband order the Salsiccia pizza ($15) while I, based on Amanda's suggestion, tried the special of  mushroom fettuccine ($16).  In the meantime, the home made garlic rolls arrived (yummy) along with the above mentioned meatballs. May I add...the leftover pomodoro sauce from the meatballs is amazing with the garlic rolls. Hey, we're on vacation, calories and carbs don't count, right?  Our entrees were served within 12-15 minutes.    My husband enjoyed his pizza - especially the pieces of fresh garlic that were cooked in the pizza sauce. Said it had very good flavor although it didn't look anywhere as good as it tasted. The crust was nicely browned; crisp but a nice soft center. However, he agreed that my dish was definitely better.  The pasta was cooked slightly al dente (perfect); the sauce was delicious and not too overwhelming (as I've had at other restaurants); and the mushrooms gave a wonderful depth and texture to the dish.  Amanda had said it was her favorite meal but typically is only served once a month. Lucky me - it was wonderful.   The pizza was enough for two as was my pasta. As we (luckily) have a hotel room with a kitchenette, we took the leftovers with us.  Nice late night snack after spending an evening in the casino, lol.  The ambiance of T.R. is quite nice; quaint vibe of a Italian cafe much like you see when visiting Italy. As we visited for an early dinner on a Monday night (10/8/12), there was seating available. But leaving an hour later, all the tables were full and I noted some people waiting.   If you're looking for some good Italian food, in a casual setting, with some top-notch service, you'll want to visit Trattoria Reggiano."}
{"text":"1. The employees were incredibly rude an unwelcoming.  We had a larger group (8) and they were openly irritated at our size.   2. Overpriced!!! An iced tea was $8 and a soft drink (Pepsi products) was $4  3. Apparently they don't have the technology to split checks.   Needless to say, we ended up not staying so we didn't have a chance to try their overpriced food."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing. I would definitely recommend as the top restaurant in downtown summerlin!"}
{"text":"Great Veal Parm and Eggplant! Service was fantastic ! Only thing I don't like is the seating is a little too close together , otherwise it was delicious real Italian food!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food! I spent two years in Italy 25 years ago, and Trattoria Reggiano brought back tastes that I remember and forgot about 25 years ago when I was in Italy. The only difference between a restaurant in Italy and Trattoria Reggiano is the service: Trattoria Reggiano gives excellent, prompt service, whereas in Italy you might have to wait 45 minutes before somebody takes your order. Try the Vodka Pasta - a unique taste that very few American Italian restaurants have."}
{"text":"We were in the mall and came across this restaurant it looked ok so we went in to have a hopefully nice meal for our 20th anniversary. First we were given fresh rolls which were nice. My wife ordered the lobster ravioli I was surprised how fresh tasting and good these were. Then I took a bite of my meal, veal parm which I have eaten and many restaurants around the US. The sauce was heavenly, the breading was exquisite and the veal was so soft, juicy and mouth watering and the portion size was unbelievable. This was by far the best veal parm I have ever eaten. The waiter was very polite and attentive. Then they brought us a k alone on the house that was very tasty. This was the perfect anniversary meal thanks to the staff and cooks at Trattoria  Reggiano"}
{"text":"The meatballs were excellent. I don't know what people were talking about. The bread is good but not as good as some reviewers make it out to be. I ordered spaghetti carbonara and it was a little too oily and a little bland for my taste. It was good but nothing so exceptional that I'm inkling to come back again. But if you want decent food at the end of a long touring day and just want an Italian option close to your hotel, this is a good spot"}
{"text":"Started strong but the lackluster service.  With all the options Vegas has to offer, move on unless you're really tired and hungry (as I was).  Garlic rolls were good but oily and cold.  Linguine in white clam sauce was average.    Started this review months ago and didn't realize I haddn't finished it. Thinking back on my experience I remember the tea/coffee stall and Quiki-mart next to the restaurant, the rude waiter and slow service and i still think I would have been happier with a soft pretzel and an ice tea from the place we passed on the way there."}
{"text":"Great place, great service and authentic Italian fare. The fresh bread is outta site!!"}
{"text":"Still an excellent choice for Italian food.  Recognized many of the staff from previous visits. Veal parm chop was excellent.  My wife's dinner was just ok. Hence the four stars."}
{"text":"My family choose to eat here based on Yelp reviews.  The wait staff was nice but the food was below average and we had to wait over an hour to get our apitizers.  My wife ordered spaghetti and meat sauce and it seemed like it was ground meat with tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Good traditional Italian food. Pizzas are a bargain and pretty large. Fresh garlic rolls are complementary and phenomenal"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. We have been there a couple times. Leave completely satisfied and totally stuffed every time.  Everyone whom works there is very nice. They were super sweet and interacted with our one year old daughter. The Cannolis are to die for!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Trattoria Reggiano at the Venetian before. Staying in Summerlin, we chose to go to the new restaurant in Summerlin and (finally) found the restaurant in the new shopping mall \"Downtown Summerlin\". Good food, not cheap, but certainly a place to go back to. What made the evening complete and why we give this 5 stars was Danny, the waiter, who really did everything to make this perfect. From asking the chef to make some changes to a plate without butter but olive oil instead to giving recommendations and helping to clear the table. Great ! Keep this attitude Danny ! Fantastic."}
{"text":"Everyone that worked there was Italian, at an Italain restaurant.  How could it be bad?  The only thing to keep it from 5 stars, the bottle of wine ordered with diner was on the warm side."}
{"text":"Even before I was seated, I was warmly greeted by the owner. When we were seated in the homey, comforting room, we were immediately waited on. The food was exceptionally good and authentic. I felt right at home. Steven C. Is an idiot. The place is great, even though its inside a hotel."}
{"text":"Really great! Very attentive, listened to everything I wanted. The food was great, the wine was great, the ambience was great. Had an awesome time."}
{"text":"We had read good reviews on this place so we took a taxi from Mandalay Bay to the Venetian to try it. The place was good, the service was good. I probably won't take a taxi so far to try it again, however if I am there I would definatly eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is just unbelievable. It really got my attention, as it's really the opposite of most huge, loud Las Vegas restaurants. We decided to try it, and we were amazed. Our server was actually Italian, so we made some conversation with him because a few of us spoke Italian. Very nice guy. The dinner rolls were great, we're still talking about them. The food and wine were overall fantastic, though on the pricey (normal for Vegas) side. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since I have been back in Vegas to go to Trattoria Reggiano again. I've been to many Italian restaurants since but nothing comes remotely close to this place. It's a fairly small and quaint location hidden within one of the most beautiful hotels. It usually has a lengthy wait because it's fairly small, but it's definitely worth it. The staff was very nice and remembers my friends whenever they go back.  I had the Spaghetti Puttanesca with no anchovies and asked for broccoli instead. They brought broccoli on the side and it was the best steamed and sauteed broccoli I have ever tasted. I have tried so hard to replicate it because the chef gave us the recipe but there has been no comparison. The garlic rolls were delicious, we kept fighting over them and the server would keep refilling them.  The food tasted like what Italian food should taste like. I think this is the closest I've been to authentic. I can't wait to go to Italy if this is what authentic is.   I definitely can't wait to go back. I miss this place. It is currently the most memorable Italian restaurant I have been to."}
{"text":"The food is very good quality and the staff is very happy to accommodate particular requests.  The atmosphere is very nice with nice outdoor terrace seating available.  There is enjoyable live singing entertainment after 7 PM.  I like that it is open at those odd hours between lunch and dinner.  My only complaint-- they don't have dark field green lettuce; if they did, I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yumm!  I've been there 2 years ago, and I fell in love with the authentic Italian food.. I went there 2 days ago, and I found myself falling in love all over again! The complimentary bread as yummy as it used to be! The chicken Parmesana was so delicious.. The only thing that's changed since my last visit is the restaurant size.. They expanded it a little.."}
{"text":"Charming Italian restaurant with authentic Italian. The atmosphere is great. The service fantastic. Loved our waiter."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time this evening and was not disappointed. The calamari was very good and crispy just the way I like it. The Caesar's salad was bold and tasty. I had the chicken parmigiana. It was tender and juicy. The marinara sauce was thick and with just the right amount of flavor. My wife had the margarita pizza. She said it was very tasty as well. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice atmosphere and good food the the price."}
{"text":"Just one meal here and I am now a super fan!  I already can't wait for my next trip to Vegas!!! I just want to eat here.    If I knew I was to die tomorrow, my last meal would be their pizza and garlic bread!  My husband, who is very finicky, LOVED his pasta!   Lastly, the service is impeccable!  It's the Nordstrom of restaurants, they want to make you happy and take great care to give you nothing less than amazing service!   The ambiance is great and it doesn't make you feel like you're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice. Filet meatballs are very very good. Service is outstanding and homey. Gnocchi pesto. Frutta di mare and bolognese consumed at our table. All Good, certainly not great, but straight ahead, simple, honest, good. When's the last time anyone said that about anything in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Read reviews on Yelp. Took forever to find in the maze of shops, and the location was not  quaint and quiet like we were hoping (it's between other bustling and busy restaurants). But... the food made up for it. Excellent pasta! Our order came out very quickly (5 minutes after we ordered!). The baked ziti with meatballs was piping hot and scrumptious. My wife had the Chicken Francese, which, she says, is the best chicken she's ever had. Good service. Great bread. Left stuffed."}
{"text":"We drove from Grand Canyon to Los Angeles, but insanely decide to drive off the path just to come and eat here, not the city (Sorry Vegas!). Well! It's our first time since their expansion. Same menu. Service and food were excellent as always, but food came in not as hot as usual. The great addition as part of expansion is the wood burning pizza oven!!  I love the oven."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Must see Eli at the bar. Amazing appetizers, salad, main course!!! Eli's wine selection was superb!! Bringing friends back here soon..."}
{"text":"BETTER THAN EVER! I think I ate there 20 times this year!  Bethany and the entire crew (including managers) make the experience fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for food and drink. Bartender Bethany is GREAT!! We go at least 3 times a month."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Been to Vegas twice and out of the many restaurants we tried, this was our favorite restaurant. We actually bought a discounted coupon for it and just figured we would try it out, and we ended up loving it. Garlic bread/knots to start which were very good - always a plus!"}
{"text":"Lovee this place. It's kinda hidden in the Venetian. Garlic bread rolls are yummy!! If you like a sauceless pasta try the Spaghetti Aglio E Olio, it's just perfect."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I use a Yelp all the time, but this is my first checkin. So worth it!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dining experience for dinner. Everything was excellent. The bread was delicious, calamari was perfectly done, pasta e fagioli was just right, tortellini alfredo, chicken francese, and baked ziti - All wonderfully prepared. Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! The owner or manger came by and she was also so nice! The garlic knots are amazing! Calamari was soooooo good and the filet meatballs were OMG delicious!  No wait and can definitely share a meal! Best food we had the whole time! Sooo glad I read reviews and they wee correct"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Italian place. Bethany at the bar is the best!  Great service and fantastic food. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely little restaurant inside the Venetian and near the Grand Canal. It is set up to seem like a street side cafe, even though it is inside. We ate out on the patio, which is great for people watching, but can be noisy if there is a lot of foot traffic going by. There are more intimate tables inside. Service is attentive and friendly and prices are very good. Portions are huge! There were 6 of us and our favorite dishes included: filet mignon meatballs, garlic knots, kale salad with peanut dressing, pesto gnocchi and pasta carbonara. We also had 2 bottles of a great Sangiovese our waiter recommended."}
{"text":"The food was good,however the place was understaffed.The server really didnt know italian food or wine.We asked several questions about the wine list and nobody could properly answer them.If you work in an Italian restraunt you really should know the difference between chianti and barolo.Surprised they dont hire more experienced serversll"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a quick dinner. It was not busy and the service was great. The garlic knots were amazing. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was really good. The best part was the lasagna. It was fresh and is probably the best we've had. This will be our new go-to place when we go to Vegas. Overall great food and fast experience."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend last night and we had a great experience! Everyone was very nice, service was fast and friendly. We had the calamari to share and it was really good. I got the carbonara and my boyfriend got the linguine in clams. Everything was very good, will definitely come back soon for another date!"}
{"text":"Ordered the veal parmigiana, waiter commented \"it was the best in town\", and I was not disappointed. It was DELICIOUS!! The breaded veal was thin and crispy, not oily or soggy, and it was  huge -like 10 inches in diameter - and came with a bowl of spaghetti. It was very fresh and tender. Hubby ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and the Filet mignon meatballs were similarly fresh and very tender.  Highly recommended for fantastic Italian food!"}
{"text":"Åt pasta carbonara,den var supergod. Min sambo åt hummer ravioli och tyckte om det jätte mycket.  Bara bra,rekommendera denna restaurang."}
{"text":"had italian a couple times in venetian strip, but this was my favorite place. feels like a mom & pop, no frills italian joint.  the spaghetti and veal meatballs was perfect. the table bread was unbelievable -- already brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with cheese"}
{"text":"This may be one of the best Italian meals I've ever had.  Maybe I was really hungry, maybe I had a bit too much of the Fat Tuesday drink, or maybe, Trattoria Reggiano is just that good.  I visited for dinner on a Sunday night and the place was packed.  There was one free table, 'outside' and we snatched that up.  Our waiter very quickly brought us menus, waters, and took our orders promptly too.  About the food:  -Garlic bread (free): delicious.  If you aren't afraid of carbs, which no one in my family is, these are your best friend.  Warm, soft, and garlicky.  These were so good that we asked for another serving after devouring the first basketful.  -Calamari ($14): a very generous portion.  It was almost too much for the four of us, almost.  There was a nice balance of both the tentacles and the rings/body and the marinara dipping sauce was just right.    -Baked ziti ($16): cheesy penne pasta; my sister seemed to enjoy this dish quite a bit.  -Spaghetti and meatballs ($18): the spaghetti is good, but what makes this dish great is the meatballs.  They are certified angus beef filet mignon meatballs.  These meatballs are perfectly seasoned, perfectly soft and flavorful.  I would definitely recommend this dish.   -Gnocchi ($18): they were out of pesto so we opted for the alfredo sauce.  The gnocchi was perfectly soft and the alfredo was nice and creamy.  In fact, the sauce was excellent for dipping the garlic bread into.  -Cannoli (free): it was my birthday and the waiter let me pick out a dessert for free!  He brought out four spoons so that we could all share also.    If you can't tell already, I really enjoyed my dining experience here.  The service was very friendly and helpful, the food was hot, and tasty, plus- I got a free dessert!  The prices are very fair and the food is high-quality."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Venetian in August for our anniversary and were looking for a place to eat for lunch on our last day in Vegas. This place is hidden away close to the Food Court area and behind a few of the shops on Canal street. There is a outside sitting area where you can watch people walking by and some booths inside.   The GF and I were craving some pizza and the pies looked good (yes I was looking at peoples food while walking by :-p). So we decided to stop in for lunch, it was quiet as it was a Tuesday afternoon. We sat in a cozy booth and it was quite comfortable. They brought us some garlic rolls with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The rolls were just ok, but they were free so no complaints from me. We shared the Pepperoni and olive pizza. It was quite a tasty pizza, the sauce was really good, and tasted great with the peperoni's. I was quite impressed with how good the crust was, thin and crunchy, not too doughy. It was the perfect size pizza for the two of us and I was not overly stuffed when we left. While we were eating an Italian tourist came in speaking Italian to the wait staff, for a second we felt as we were in Italy. Our waitress was great, attentive and provided to the atmosphere.   Overall a good experience, would I eat here again if i was in Vegas? Probably not but that is not because of the food or service but simply because there are too many place to try in Vegas. Why eat at the nearby food court when this is right next to it? If you're looking for an relatively inexpensive, tasty meal, I would definitely recommend Trattoria's."}
{"text":"Best pasta I had in the last few years!!! Was just perfect! I had Linguine bolognese with a looot of meat( filet mignon) and a great sauce. The appetizer was also amazing . Loved everything! I will surely come back."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find this small place. Their salads are divine, perfectly covered with the right balance of oil and vinegar / lemon. And the whole food is wonderful. I would never have thought they were like that."}
{"text":"Hubby and I searched far and low for this spot based on Yelp, and finally found it!  We were not disappointed either, the food was yummy and generous, the garlic knots were delicious and of course, I had a relaxing glass of the Monterey Pinot Noir!  Eric, our waiter, was polite, provided great service and made our dining experience lovely!! We will return!"}
{"text":"Had a terrific meal here. The quality to price ratio is terrific anywhere, let alone Vegas, a barren wasteland of restaurants that actually live up to the hype.  The waitress/bartender makes a terrific martini to boot.  Finally, the place is very family friendly, were one inclined to bring their kiddos to Vegas for some reason."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place based on Yelp reviews. EXCELLENT, personable service. I love how authentic everything, including the employees were. I have an Italian last name and they pronounced it beautifully. The rolls are to die for- warm and dripping with butter and garlic. Mixed green salad was so fresh and tasted so good with the house dressing. Loved the Linguine Bolognese - it's the real deal! Portions are very large. Servers are super attentive to every detail and so very kind and appreciative. No wait and fast service. I will refer this to anyone who wants an amazing Italian dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and stellar service. My fiancé ordered the lobster ravioli and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. I couldn't be more pleased with this quaint Las Vegas dining experience!"}
{"text":"Amanda, the server, is AWESOME.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs, my boyfriend had the shrimp scampi. We loved our meal and the portion sizes were more than sufficient.  The garlic rolls were heavenly. Rolls should not be that damn good.  I had not read the reviews prior to trying out this restaurant. But the reviews are on point. If you are in the area, and in the mood for fantastic Italian food and superior service, you should try Trattoria Reggiano.  If you do, tell Amanda that Don and Yolanda from Chicago said hello, and that we'll never pay for parking in Vegas again (insider)."}
{"text":"Had a blessed evening!   The waiter SERGIO is a sweet person! Lovely food!  Huuuuge for those hungry ones lol"}
{"text":"So completely average... This place wouldn't get noticed in NYC. Its a decent affordable option"}
{"text":"When visiting Las Vegas,this is the place to have dinner, the food was great and so was the friendly staff"}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite restaurants in Vegas! Every visit to Vegas includes dinner here. I'm the type of person who wants to try new places all the time. That's how I found Trattoria Reggiano. It is the only restaurant in Vegas that I can't miss when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Summerlin next to the movie theatre, I strolled in here late last Sunday night. There's a lot of options for Italian in downtown Summerlin, but I was curious to try this place out after walking past it so many times- I'm glad I did. I tried the Chicken Parmesan and pepperoni pizza, so delicious! Their marinara had excellent flavor and they immediately give you garlic knots upon sitting down, (mouthwatering) but be careful not to get full before your food comes! Portions are on the larger side and the restaurant is nice but not elegant, perfect for just a casual date night or dinner with family. Also, friendly staff! I was one of the last tables and didn't feel rushed at all."}
{"text":"we were staying nearby, so moseyed over for some italian.  the mall/food court-like environment around the place isn't great, but once inside, it feels cozy enough.  we had the burrata special app, garlic knots, and penne vodka with shrimp and spaghetti & meatballs.   Garlic knots were fantastic, and the sauce for the spaghetti & meatballs was great.  penne vodka was also very good.  service with a smile, and not crazy expensive, which we somewhat expected, as it is in the Venetian on the strip."}
{"text":"We went on a busy night during the holiday season but were able to make a reservation for two anyway. They were nice about accommodating. I thought the food here was surprisingly good. I had shrimp scampi and my husband had swordfish. Both were very flavorful and nicely prepared. The service was very good albeit a bit slow (not over the top great, but still good). The ambiance is just okay....we were seated inside and it's very cramped (indoor dining area is really small). Overall, a tasty meal. I would go back again for the food."}
{"text":"This place was perfect for our needs- we were all starving, one of our party is a vegetarain so Italian works for her, the Venetian wasn't that far from our hotel AND we wanted to to stop at Bouchon Bakery anyway so bing, bang, boom Trattoria Reggiano it was!  The prices are a bit high for basic Italian food ($20 for an entree vs. $15) but it was the tasty, saucy, carby mid-range Italian food of our dreams.  And the bread! Maybe it's because I was so hungry but the garlic rolls were extra delicious and buttery!  I liked that it looked like a little hole in the wall and had \"outside\" seating, we didn't have to wait at all, food came out quickly, I would reccmomend this if you were looking for moderatly priced satisfying meal on the strip."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially the bread. Bethany is the best bartender and we will keep coming back often as long as she's there"}
{"text":"The food was awesome, great service, welcoming environment. Our server Victor was so helpful, he gave us great suggestions. The food was amazing! We got different kinds of pasta. They were all so good & the garlic balls were just perfect! Love this place. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"This is a excellent restaurant but it's very small.  We have never had anything that wasn't good.  I love the pasta sauce, the salad dressing... If u go on a weekend plan on a wait but most week nights it's no more then 10 min wait.  I wish they were able to give a little more elbow space but it's still a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not a big fan. Was comparable to a regular food court Italian eatery but with a $$$ price tag. Ordered the caprese salad and was void of flavor. The wine was weak and did not pair well. The eggplant appetizer was soggy but there was potential for something pleasant. The tortellini tasted like a micowaved Marie Calendars. The garlic  knots were under cooked and lathered in a salty butter crust that was nearly defibrillator worthy. I am not going to return and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Such a fun place.  Waiters are yelling in Italian, kitchen is right there and noisy, tables are close together, the bread is freshly heated and smothered with garlic,  so Italian.  Love it.   I'm very specific with food but it is always yummy, fresh and satisfying."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant at Downtown Summerlin. Daniel G was outstanding!!.he made us feel right at home... the food was excellent, the service was great definitely a Hidden Gem. Good portions for the price, please don't change that and Please keep the Broccoli  Raab on the menu, the Tiramisu was off the chain!! Locals should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out for a late Sunday dinner. The outside seating was cozy and the weather was perfect. The bread served before dinner was amazing! The server called it bread but it was delicious garlic knots. Calamari also amazing as an appetizer and finished up with a bruschetta pizza.  It was all plenty of food to share for 2."}
{"text":"Always amazing, we are now long time repeat customers for years to come. Authentic Italian is hard to find. Super fresh food, great atmosphere in downtown summerlin, great staff. Love it! Can't go wrong with the Filet meatballs, calamari is so fresh-you can see them cutting it there, the CANNOLI and chocolate cake TO DIE FOR! Yum."}
{"text":"Very good lunch. Bread is awesome, if you are a garlic butter kind of person. Chicken parmigiana alfredo w/chicken. Very tasty and hot."}
{"text":"Thanks to the Yelp community, my friend and I stumbled onto this lovely restaurant nestled in a far corner of the Venetian right next to the magic store and coffee bean.   I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this place. As when you're walking through the Venetian feeling like you're \"outdoors\", strolling Venice, Trattoria Reggiano exuded a relaxing respite from shopping and the many, many frou-frou Vegas restaurant options. The smell of the fresh-baked garlic rolls becomes more pungent as you get closer and the warm, welcoming personalities of the staff definitely made us feel as if we were walking into our neighborhood Italian restaurant. Everything felt very authentic from the quality of the olive oil, the fresh-grated parmesan cheese, and the colorful options of Italian soda and (iced) teas.   Food standouts (SOOOO good my friend and I ate there two days out of our 3 day Vegas trip):   - Garlic rolls: Ridiculously delicious. Served piping hot.   - Spaghetti Aglio e Olio: generous portion of pasta cooked perfectly al dente with olive oil, crushed red pepper, parsley, and fresh grated parmesan cheese. A simple but traditional dish so you know the flavor was REALLY good.   - Penne in Vodka Sauce: another generous portion of pasta cooked perfectly al dente with shallots, vodka, proscuitto in creamy pink sauce. My friend is super-model skinny and she ate the entire dish - it was THAT good.   - Cannoli. Holy eff. This is the best cannoli I've ever tasted. The marscarpone cream was light and fluffy, the shell was crunchy, and there were just enough chocolate chips for sweetness.   Considering all of the trips I've taken to Vegas, Trattoria Reggiano is definitely a standout. I can't wait to visit again. Delizioso!"}
{"text":"An older, grey haired waiter with a name tag that read Sergio, ruined my birthday celebration!! My husband and I are a middle aged, well groomed couple. There was no obvious reason why this waiter should decide he did not wish to wait on us or be civil in any way. He took our order after waiting on tables that arrived after we did. Then he said to me, I am not making this up, \"What do you want?\" He did not ask if I wanted a beverage. HE was equally rude to my husband. He did not check on us after our meals arrived but spent much time doting on the couples who were seated on both sides of us. He refused to make eye contact with me. He did not clear our tables nor ask if we wished to have desert. I was in tears, utterly confused, angry and very upset. We will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Service was excellent. I went with a group of 6 on two different occasions and it was excellent both times. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The garlic knots are to die for! We had amazing service and our food (lasagna and baked ziti) was awesome. We were very pleasantly surprised and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The food here was so delicious! I can't wait to come back! The space itself is tiny, but worth the cramped quarters once we started eating. The bread is great, as is the pasta. You can tell everything is made fresh, it's just so good."}
{"text":"Trattoria Reggiano is a great local Summerlin Italian restaurant for causal alfresco dinning. Our bartender and cocktails were fantastic! I love that they allow you to bring your own bottles of wine (for a small pour fee) adds a fun personal touch to the dinning experience. The appetizers and entrées all around the table were on point, well seasoned, excellent portion size and absolutely delicious! This place will definitely be our go-to when in the mood for Italian!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened today! Service was excellent!! My wife is pregnant and not able to have bleu cheese. The item she ordered had some crumbled on top. Ben took ownership and insisted on remaking the dish without it. After my wife was cool enough to say she would just pick it off, Ben insisted and had the dish remade. Wonderful staff, great food, and most importantly to me great service. We highly recommend this new spot at DT Summerlin, we will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"Dad says best clam sauce pasta outside of Venice!  Cute restaurant inside the Venetian. I've been to Venice so I can vouch for how much like Venice they tried to imitate!  My parents and I got the Warm Spinach salad, lobster ravioli, and linguine with clams in white sauce. Warm Spinach Salad: huge portion. Meant to be a shared appetizer or a main dish. Not a side salad. All the ingredients were fresh The tomatoes, nuts, bacon, onion, cheese... EVERYTHING WENT SO WELL TOGETHER. Lobster ravioli: good portion of lobster in the ravioli. Did not taste seafood-y at all which was pleasant. Linguine with clams in white sauce. My dad said it tasted like the ones we had in Italy... and that must be a good thing!  A little slow.. but still friendly service!"}
{"text":"My very favorite spot in LV. A fresh alternative for all of those lame overpriced places.  Everything is tasteful here. Meatballs, salads, bread, you name it. The prices are pretty reasonable (LV standards) and the setting is cozy, charming and great for people watching.  I like to call this place the hidden gem of LV."}
{"text":"The 4 star rating is for the food, service was more of a mixed bag.  But, let's start with the positive.  The food was spot on and really nice for a casual, relaxed neighborhood place.  The garlic rolls are some of the best I've had in town.  For some reason, most of the garlic knots I've tried here in Vegas have not been up to par.  These are the exception.  They're soft and have that stretch and bounce of a good knot, garlicky with olive oil and a sprinkle of Parmesanm and served with extra bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Margarita pizza with burrata was excellent, Caesar salad was tasty with dressing on the vinegary side, kids meals were decent and each meal came with a mini cannoli for dessert.  Meatballs looked great but didn't try. I would absolutely come back for the food.  Ok, here's the scoop on the service.  I think we just had an overworked server that day and that person was not at their best.  I prefer to give them the benefit of e doubt bc we all have our bad days.  Suffice it to say, service and attitude were subpar but not enough to complain to management.   In the end, we just wanted to pay our bill and move along.  The hostess and manager were very nice and courteous and greeted everyone at the door.  Conclusion:  food's great but the waitstaff could use a bit more training.  We'll be back to try again."}
{"text":"Right when we checked into the Venetian I was really hungry. I wanted to eat somewhere close by. Trattoria Reggiano is located on the second floor right next to the escalators near the floors 1-16 in the Venetian.  It's a small restaurant with few seating.  In fact there are more tables outside then inside.  When I say outside it's actually indoors where people walk by.  Their menu consists of salads, pastas, and pizzas.  They bring out complimentary bread to your table.  These small bread pieces are covered in butter, seasoning, and parmesan cheese.  I ordered the bruschetta pizza and it didn't disappointed.  It was freaking delicious! The bottom of the pizza was crispy but not burnt.  The toppings include tomato sauce, shredded mozzarella, fresh cubes of mozzarella, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and basil.  All of the ingredients were fresh.  The service was great because they checked on us often and got us refills on bread and drinks.  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.  Can't wait to go back and try other pizzas."}
{"text":"I've walked past this little gem many times while at the Venetian. When we trying to decide on a late lunch, we both thought of Trattoria Reggiano and decided to give it a try. We were both pleased that we did. It reminded us of a small italian family place with great food and a great staff complimented by a cute setting. We had salads and shared a pizza. It was really a great choice. Trattoria Reggiano, ya done good! Thanks for a great dinner."}
{"text":"Do not walk by!!! Go in to eat here. Delicious!! We stayed at the Venetian for 3 nights and while shopping I kept walking by. Finally I had a craving for spaghetti and meatballs....oh baby baby wow!! From the garlic rolls dripping with olive oils ad garlic, to the house salad, to our spaghetti (mine with meatballs, the other with clams). Given how expensive meals can be in Vegas, we averaged $100 each meal while here, our check was a surprising $75 including two glasses of wine. Yeah!! Now i can get my revenge on the blackjack tables."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great time here. We came here on a rare, childless Thursday night and had a wonderful meal. We ordered the eggplant rollatini to start, which was wonderful. We were pleasantly surprised when they brought out garlic knots as their bread and an amuse bouche of Parmesan hunks, olives and roasted red pepper slices. I had to deliberately not fill up before my entree came out. I ordered the tortelloni and they were perfection. Delicate, flavorful perfection. I speculate that they hand make them because of how well they were cooked. My husband had the gnocchi and he thoroughly enjoyed that dish. We will definitely be back. I look forward to bringing my 8 year old foodie next time."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this restaurant after reading so many positive reviews. Unfortunately my experience was that it was just average. I guess it's location near the back of The Venetian Food Court area should have been the first sign. I was seated outside sandwich between two other tables. It took awhile for the waiter to come by with the menu and my water. The complimentary garlic rolls were okay, nothing to rave about. I saw the owner, or someone in management, walking around and talking to some tables. I was hoping he'd stop by mine, but it looked like he was just stopping by familiar faces. I almost always order eggplant if it's on the menu. I must say I was very disappointed. They were length wise slices layered on top of each other with tons of cheese on top - it reminded me of an eggplant lasagna. The great thing about Vegas is that there are tons of restaurants to choose from. Skip this one."}
{"text":"The over all taste of the food was very good.  Lobster Ravioli and Bucatini with garlic knots. Our order was a to go order.  First call had to hang up and call back into place my order because the guy didn't know the menu.  Second call the young lady was on point.  We will be going back to try more items on the menu. I approve this message J K KUHL.."}
{"text":"We ended up at eating here after missing our dinner rez and getting out of a cirque show after 11P. One would think there would be several more dining options open and serving late night dinners, especially on the weekends and after shows but the options are a bit scarce.   The best thing here... the garlic rolls! I really liked them. Everything else was just mediocre.  Our drinks - I had a carafe of red sangria. Not great! Didn't finish it. I didn't think I was very picky about my sangria, turns out I am. Perhaps I just like Blake Shelton's version. My boyfriend had a mojito, he didn't seem so fond of it. I was looking for a nice Sangiovese on the menu, they don't have one.  I had Linguine in Clam Sauce. Gotta love a meal that puts you to work after midnight ;) the baby clams sautéed in white wine, garlic and olive oil were yummy, the linguine was lackluster. Did not taste like fresh pasta at all.  My boyfriend ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs so I refrained from ordering the Meatball appetizer since he'd have them with his dish. Our server was so sure of these meatballs made with filet mignon he even said he'd take care of us if my boyfriend didn't like them. I thought for sure they'd be amazing. My boyfriend wasn't impressed at all and since I don't eat a lot of meat I wasn't going to even give them a try. My boyfriend finished his meal and we both replied politely when asked how things were.  I mean who wants to be the couple at closing to tell them their food isn't great...? Not us, apparently :)  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place, unless of course it's late and your options are limited. There are other better nearby options."}
{"text":"Two o'clock and we showed up with a scooter that I need from an injury. 2 tables taken. An empty restaurant and they would not accommodate us. Went to Mercato. What a blessing in st marks square. Best Italian dinner in Vegas with the best ambience. Thank you for turning us away."}
{"text":"We ate there last evening. It was late for us getting into town and we wanted something close to the Venetian.  The service was quick, there was no waiting and it was excellent food.  I will agree with the other comments about the meatballs - they were excellent.  It was a little different atmosphere with not a lot of indoor seating but that made it unique and all the better."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent burrata and tomato salad!!  Good service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First off props to the awesome busser Donald! He is the only reason we had any kind of decent service. He is treated so bad by the server Ricki and it's sad to see someone work so hard for someone so rude.    We had a party of nine and from the beginning server Ricki was helping the hostess seat us. They were both annoyed and we just seemed to be an \"inconvenience\" to them. After we sat down Ricki was our server, and she asked what we wanted to drink. She offered alcohol we said no alcohol. She stated that she didn't ask if we wanted it. Okay well whatever than. After she bossed her busser to get drinks she took our order and we asked for bread please. She stated \"once your food order goes in than you will get bread, you will have to wait\". The whole time she was treating her busser like he was a slave.   She got our pizza wrong. The food was okay. Nothing to rave about.   We couldn't get her attention for anything she was to busy hanging out at the hostess stand talking and chatting. On the way out I told a manager about the experience and Ricki had the nerve to come chase us down in the walkway to the stores in downtown summerlin to tell us she didn't have an attitude and we were wrong. Talk about uncomfortable and so awful! Horrible customer service. We won't be returning! :("}
{"text":"Service was good. Asked for extra lime, extra sauce, extra cheese... got them all.  We asked for a booth for us 2 and they were glad to do it.    Spaghetti and meatballs was about as good as the dish gets.  Calamari was solid... we get it often.    I got a Bloody Mary and asked for it spicy but it really just ended up being salty, but that happens.   Meal with an appetizer and a drink each was $95... just kind of a fact. The strip isn't cheap."}
{"text":"If you are looking for reasonably priced italian fare or the best Spaghetti and Meatballs in Las Vegas, come to Trattoria Reggiano.  I love Italian food and this place does not disappoint.  From the large portions, delicious food, and friendly service... it's no wonder why there is wait.  If you love Italian food and are able to find this place in the shopping malls of the Venetian, you'll be in for a real treat.  The meal starts with the complimentary garlic butter rolls... sinfully good.  As usual, we shared a number of entrees for the table including a appetizer, pizza, and pasta.  So we ordered calamari, prosciutto pizza, and the famous spaghetti and meatballs.  All were very delicious and are actually making my mouth water while I write this review.  I do have to point out that their meatballs are far from regular.  Their claim to fame is that their meatballs are filet mignon... and I believe them 100%.  The meatballs are very tender and almost fall and you cut through them with your fork.  They are ridiculous good.  Don't miss out on Trattoria Reggiano if you are in search for good italian food in Las Vegas.  I've had my fair share of Italian in the city including Scarpetta, D.O.C.G, etc. and the food here is on par (if not better) than any of those fine-dining establishments."}
{"text":"The food was alright for the price we paid, however the service was absolutely horrible. It doesn't take 2 hours to serve two bowls of pasta. Additionally, they had my order wrong. This place doesn't deserve a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Came in earlier this week with some girl friends for lunch. We were seated right away at a great table. Our waitress came very quickly and made some great recommendations . I remember her name as Ricky. Short blonde hair. Our food came in a timely manner and everything was superb.  My friends and I have decided to make this place our new regular meetup place. Great food. Excellent staff. And loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious italian dinner.  We had the Filet of Sole Meuniere.  Nice friendly atmosphere.  Live music on the patio.  Very personal staff.  Ask for Sam he is awesome. Great place to relax and enjoy at the Downtown Summerlin mall."}
{"text":"There are really some great Italian places at the Venetian.  Surprise, Surprise!  The food at this place was great.  I LOVED the eggplant parm and the penne.  We also got some baked ziti, which I didn't particularly care for.  It wasn't bad, but the sauce/cheese combo just didn't jive with me.  The bread could have been good, but it was very cold; like they took it right out of the fridge.  I do want to call out that the waiter was kind of an ass.  It was strange, because he would do everything we asked and would return relatively politely, but whenever we asked for something he always grimaced, sighed, or pouted.  Very strange.  All the waiters here were old men.  Maybe he was just tired due to old age.  I don't know, but I found this strange and worth calling out.  And it wasn't just him; even the guy we talked to in terms of seating was pretty rude.  He said we could have this \"inside\" table right away and when asked about an outside \"table\" he rudely just said, \"NO!\".  The service is the only reason I bumped my review down to 3 instead of 4 stars.  There were at least a couple of other highly rated restaurants at this hotel.  I wish we had gone to one of those.  I'm sure they would've had great food AND service.  I don't know what it is, but I've been on a really bad streak with restaurant service."}
{"text":"Amazing food well cooked pasta and great service and they really liked this place.. And I got a really big dish"}
{"text":"A nice place tucked away in the Venetian.    It came recommended by some other tourists, so we gave it a try.  The food is pretty good for a cafe style restaurant. The pizza marguerite is better than the one at Otto and Reggiano offers a better more casual experience overall: win-win. The wine and deserts are good as well.    Service was smooth and attentive and there are good vegetarian options.  I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!  The only thing worse than the service is the food. Overpriced bland food served by staff who would rather shoot the breeze with each other than actually wait tables.   Because of the poor service, I left a small tip (I probably should have given nothing) and believe it or not, when I checked my credit card statement I noticed that the amount had been changed. I called the restaurant and after investigating, they confirmed that the waiter had actually crossed out the amount of the tip and written in another amount! Blatant theft and credit card fraud!  If you go (which I wouldn't recommend), pay with cash."}
{"text":"Good food. Absolutely amazing sangria. The restaurant is located right next to the Gondola ride at the Venetian and the ambience is very good."}
{"text":"Love love this place Las Vegas location inside the Venetian great food especially the lasagna and I'm from New York I know lasagna!!! The waiter Victor was awesome pleasant and super helpful!!! If your visiting you've got to go eat here!!"}
{"text":"Perfect service, bad food. Didn't like the chicken Parmesan nor the fillet mignon spaghetti."}
{"text":"This a gem hidden in the Venetian of Las Vegas. After doing some research on affordable more personal restaurants in Vegas, this was the obvious go to. After finding it in a mall like food court within the Venetian we were surprised at how small it was! It was pretty packed, but we offered to wait, and it was worth it! The food was great and it was nice getting away from the craziness of Vegas for a little bit without breaking the bank.  Sadly, we were seated by a group of young drunk guys who were spilling their drinks and being loud and rude to the waitstaff. If we didn't have the misfortune of this, I would give the place 5 stars. I understand that this is more common when you're in Vegas, but I have to judge the overall experience fairly, and with the place being so small in size, it was very hard to ignore.. Outside of this, the restaurants was 5 stars itself, keep up what you're doing and maybe throw in a apology or two when your guests have to put up with other rowdy customers ;)."}
{"text":"the food is totally average italian, but its actually reasonably priced, and this is a great place to take a big group for dinner. i was having a hard time finding a place in vegas that didnt have a pre fix menu once you had 15 people or more. this place lets you order whatever you want, and no minimum per person. if youre staying at the venetian and you have a big crew, this is your best bet."}
{"text":"This place was fine. Like everything in vegas it was overpriced and I can make much better pasta at home. I got the spaghetti and meatballs, since it had a lot of positive reviews and I found the sauce to be kind of watery and bland. The meatball was huge and dense and also rather flavorless.  I was starving however and the service was quick and friendly.  Frankly, I was disappointed with the food and wouldn't return, but the servers were really nice and made the experience more tolerable."}
{"text":"Best Italian Resturant I had ever dined in.  Small and quaint with super friendly staff. My wife loves pasta and she tried many dishes from many places but she actually said this maybe the best Resturant she ever visited. I gave it a five star. If you are in vegas it is a must restaurant to dine. Do not miss this opportunity; you will regret it."}
{"text":"I had great meals all over Vegas but this place wasn't one of them. I saw the great reviews and decided to give this place a try but it was mediocre at best. The food was pricey considering its simplicity and it lacked flavor. Even the garlic rolls left much to be desired. The atmosphere is odd and the waiter was a little snooty."}
{"text":"On our most recent Vegas trip my family chose to dine here again instead of trying a new place because it is THAT amazing.  About three years ago we celebrated my sister's birthday here and we loved it so much we celebrated my mother's birthday here this time. Three years and it is STILL consistently great!  I made a reservation on Open Table for a Monday at 5:30pm. We arrived on time and our table was ready. There were other guests, but it wasn't too busy - understandable given it was early and a Monday.  The atmosphere is kinda casual dressy - there are white tablecloths and cloth napkins, but it is brightly lit and open. There were children dining as well so it is kid friendly. I think they'll even give the kids crayons.   The waiter was VERY friendly and funny! Made casual jokes but wasn't inappropriate or anything like that. He promptly brought us water and their delicious buttery/oily/garlicky rolls! They're so soft and fluffy! There's olive oil and balsamic for dipping as well. Mmm the perfect way to start a meal. Our food came out pretty quickly too. It's an open kitchen so you can see them preparing everything fresh!  Chicken Cesar salad ($16): a little pricy for a salad, but I had it as my entree so not too bad on Vegas price standards. They give you a big plate of romaine perfectly coated in creamy dressing. It's topped with shaved Parmesan and grilled chicken that was marinated in balsamic. So good and a good amount to share.   Calamari appetizer ($14): perfect size for the 6 of us to share. Each piece fried crispy and there was a good ratio of rings to tentacles. Served with yummy marinara sauce and lemon.   Filet mignon meatballs ($16): my sister and her husband shared this appetizer, but let us all try it. The most tender meatballs you will ever have! Mmm the tomato sauce is perfect with it to. Topped with Parmesan and comes with three to an order.   Penne in vodka sauce ($18): perfectly cooked penne in a creamy tomato sauce cooked with onions and topped with prosciutto. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed it.   Chicken Marsala ($22): my mother's boyfriend ordered this and said it was the BEST chicken Marsala he's ever had! I tried it and it WAS good, considering it's something I would probably never order. The chicken was tender and the sauce was well balanced.   Spaghetti bolognese ($18): my sister and her husband shared this and said it was very tasty - they ate the entire plate.   Since we were celebrating my mother's birthday they gave us a tiramisu on the house! So sweet of them. It was served in a glass cup with two lady fingers sticking out of it. The cup was held to the plate with caramel which was tasty and cool to look at.   Once again this restaurant did not disappoint and I would return and recommend! I'm sure everything on the menu is delicious, but then I always want to eat my favorites because they're that good! If you're in Vegas and want good Italian food that will not break your bank - go here!"}
{"text":"Second time here and it was a wonderful meal for all of us. The bread was delicious!! We had a great salad and split three main dishes that were great. Cannot say anything bad about the place, even our waiter, Victor was a delight! We will go again when we visit Vegas"}
{"text":"The worst Italian food and service from Surgio. Olive Garden is 5 stars compared to this place. I could just rant forever but it's not worth my time."}
{"text":"Today was the first day of their opening after the remodel, this is my favorite place to eat and the food was so good the spinach salad was so fresh the chicken with the white Alfredo sauce umm how do I say this the taste was Absolutely amazing!!!  Our server is a sweet heart the whole staff there are great people and we will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Located in downtown Summerlin..has plenty of parking. Came here for an early dinner and was very pleased. You can sit either inside or out...we sat outside because it was perfect temp out at the time. We were greeted by a friendly hostess with a smile. We were immediately seated and brought water and a complimentary plate of olives, cheese and roasted peppers. Very tasty!   After we ordered we were given the best garlic knots I ever had!! Warm, lightly salted and moist. So delicious we asked for more! Perfect to dip in the wonderful balsamic vinegar and olive oil.   We started with the arugula salad. The dressing is light and tasty. We ordered the large size and they split it for us. We really appreciate that type of service. We also ordered the ziti pasta with meatballs. The meatballs are made with filet and pork. The dish comes with 2 huge delicious meatballs. The pasta is covered in a creamy and cheesy sauce. The dish is huge and we all took some home. I recommend you split this dish..as it's very filling. The service is excellent, the food is delicious! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I am with the food at this restaurant. Our waiter was excellent! He always kept our drinks full and our table attended to. Unfortunately, the food was crap. The pictures of the bread looked soooo good on other reviews - I had such high hopes! But, alas, the bread was rock hard and nigh flavorless (more pretzel like). The pasta, I kid you not, tasted EXACTLY like Chef Boyardee ravioli. We will not be going back. Macaroni Grill beats this place by miles."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant; food is good so was service however the crowd is 50+ especially at the bar."}
{"text":"Worst service- be prepared to lose your appetite from the frustration!  Asked on three separate occasions to three separate folks for oil and vinegar- got it on fourth try .  Manager offered to comp the bill- I refused !  This high potential restaurant need serious training/corporate attention- it's on a rough start- sorry!"}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza! Small, tucked away restaurant in the Venetian with great service and engaging bartenders."}
{"text":"Here on a quiet Wednesday evening with nice weather so we are enjoying it. It's our first time here and we like it. The pizza was great and the calamari was... Good but not exceptional.   The manager Vito is great."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Summerlin. Great food, great atmosphere. The only complaint I have is the limited bar selection. They carry a good selection of wines and they have your basic hard liquor. I'm a Scotch guy, and I REALLY wished they served Balvenie 14 year Caribbean Cast."}
{"text":"For our last night in Vegas we were looking for something a little on the cheap. The roulette wheel was not kind to us. The Venetian website listed this as a casual dining place in the one $ price range so it seemed like it'd be the perfect place.   For two glasses of wine, some meatballs for an app, and two pasta dishes we walked out $90 poorer. When you start approaching the $100 range I'm thinking of a decent place back home on Federal Hill in Providence or the North End in Boston. While Trattoria Reggiano wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't worth it.   It's a small place with some very crowded tables outside the restaurant. We were quickly seated at one of these and it had all the atmosphere of a mall food court. By the end of the meal I felt as I intimately knew the couple on the side of us because we could easily hear the conversation as well as we could hear our own. Luckily the small children on the other side of us were extremely well behaved because being stuffed so closed to them, it had the potential for disaster.   The service was ok, but there was a team of four guys working the place and each of the four had a hand in our service. We didn't have one set waiter. One of the guys didn't like to talk and took our order with mumbles and gestures, but the rest of the guys were nice enough.   The small plate of tortelini I had was decent enough, but nothing to write home about. The gnocci that the girlfriend had was drowning in pesto and wasn't homemade.   We would've had a cheaper and more enjoyable dinner at Olive Garden. We threw money away like drunken sailors all week and then picked a bad time to try searching out an inexpensive option. We would've been much better off dropping a few extra bucks on a nicer place."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I got the baked ziti and meatballs. Very good!! Definitely recommend this if you feel like Italian."}
{"text":"Great food but I agree with a previous reviewer, they take the plates and clear the table too soon.  Makes you feel rushed. It's a small place, that could be why.."}
{"text":"This is me and my girlfriends go to spot when we come down to Vegas.   The location is a little hidden but the closest  entrance is close to the Tao nightclub. It doesn't have the nicest scenery but the food is what makes us come back.   Since my first time we ate here I have gotten lasagna and it has been my go to dish every time I come! My girlfriend and friend have gotten other dishes such as pastas and fettuccini and although they said it was good, they said it was nothing to rave about. But my girlfriend decided to get the lasagna like me the last time we came and she said this would be her go to dish from on now. She loved it so much!"}
{"text":"Out of all the restaurants in downtown Summerlin this is by far my favorite!   Offers both indoor and outdoor seating. Very Italian and fun atmosphere.   For starters I think the kale salad is exceptional. I don't usually like kale but in this form it is delicious. Chicken Parmesan, gnocchi and baked ziti are among some of the entrees I have tried and all are very good! (My favorite being the gnocchi).   Canoli's are also excellent!  I recommend this place if you are ever in down town Summerlin. I will continue to return. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing place for lunch service, a good wine selection to compliment most meals. It did take a while to get food but everything seemed like it was made when ordered, with quality ingredients. The portions are very generous, as they should be to meet the higher than average prices."}
{"text":"This is not one of the fancy restaurants you see inside of the hotels on the Strip.  The restaurant itself is super small and you might end up seated outside the restaurant in the aisle.  So if you are looking for an intimate romantic dinner, this place is not for you for sure.  But if you are just looking for a good Italian food reasonably priced, then this place is for you.    My husband loved his lobster ravioli and I liked my dish too.  The dessert was too sweet for my taste but I bet a lot of people like it.  Two pasta dishes and a dessert = $55 plus tip.  The service is good... the owner (I am guessing he was the owner) stands outside of the restaurant, greeting people and keeping eyes on the tables.    This place is a bit hard to find so ask a security guard for a direction when you enter the Venetian."}
{"text":"Fresh and the best Itailian food you will get that is the closest to being to Italy!!  Garlic rolls are awesome!!!  All the salads and pasta dishes are wonderful, especially the meatballs!!  Everytime we come over to vacation in Vegas we make this a must have dinner on our list!!  Very small mom n pop place so big groups is not really ideal, keep it to 6 or less.  Small kids would be bored so be respectful and don't take them.  Good date night dinner place!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment, I was really looking forward to trying this place. All the great reviews for mediocre type of Italian food. It was like eating at an expensive version of an olive garden with the same crappie food. Don't know if maybe it was the wrong time or what but I definitely expected a lot more out of it. (Came around 2:30pm) The price is never an issue for me as long as you give great quality food and authentic...none of that here."}
{"text":"Another amazing meal at this fine italian restaurant. It was a birthday celebration and we had a group of 5. The server was very nice and attentive and provided great recommendations. The kale peanut salad is so amazing. The large portion is plenty for sharing. Also, the server recommened i add shrimp to the pesto gnocchi and it paired perfectly. Everyone at the table tried it and agreed it was a great choice. The pesto sauce is very good and the portion size is large. The garlic knots are to die for. The espresso drinks are made on a fine imported italian machine. Pairs perfectly with a cannoli or chocolate cake. There was great live music and the performer even sang happy brithday to our mother. The atmosphere is very inviting and everything on the menu is delicious! What more can yoh ask for?  This place is always packed for dinner when I've been. I hope they open a bigger location at some point to accomodate more patrons because the food is so darn good!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars but I always round up in the businesses favor. I called in my order and Ricki answered. She stated she would need to put me on hold cause she was way too busy to help me. Umm ok. I'd rather the business pick up and say \"thank you for calling xxxx Can we place you on a short hold??\" Not say we are too busy to help you. Anyways, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.   After I place my order for the Margherita con Burrata pizza, I was told 10 minutes. I arrive after about 12 minutes and am greeted by Ricki, who happens to be the waitress. She's serving multiple tables and answering phone calls?? Come on, are you serious? Now I understand why she told me she's too busy to help me. So I sit at the bar and wait about 10 more minutes for my pizza. I ask for red pepper and she tells me \"if you want some I would have to go next door and get it\" (next door is also their business). I just felt like she didn't care.   Thankfully the pizza was delicious and I care more about the food then the service. I'll be back, just hope for a better interaction."}
{"text":"Great food and great experience, our second visit before visiting the Beatles Love show! Sammy our waiter made the experience great, with his wine and food knowledge his recommendations were spot on! Just a note don't be put off by the fact that the restaurants in the Venetian food court this is a 5 star quality food & service! Thanks again SAMMY !  Grazie... Grazie...Grazie"}
{"text":"This restaurant openly discriminates against people with children. If that appeals to you, great, but wait - there's more!  It has terrible service too.  We walked up with our three kids when we saw there were at least six tables open.  We were told \"there was a reservation\" and that we could put our name on the list.  We did and went for a walk, for about 45 minutes.  We walked by again and guess what?  The same tables were open.  I asked again and guess what we were immediately seated, though the hostess seemed unwilling to do so.  What about that list? It was never mentioned.  They put us in the back corner.  I saw the same open table in the front patio that had been and still was open when we first asked to be seated.  And when I asked, you guessed it, a \"reservation.\"    The hostess had an extremely unwelcoming attitude. She said that they didn't have a kids' menu and we would have to order off of the adults menu.  Once we sat we were ignored for about 10 minutes.  It was clear that we weren't welcome, so we got up and left.   When I walked by an hour later after eating somewhere else, that table was still open.     Let's get one more thing straight - this is no gourmet restaurant - it's in the middle of a mall adjacent to a food court!  There are kids and families everywhere.  Yet another business that has no need for paying customers! Don't bother going there!"}
{"text":"Great place, small, but good service and very delicious. Filet Mignon meatballs, and Veal Parm both fantastic!  Highly recommended, one of the best Italian places in Vegas.  Best of all, prices were incredibly reasonable.  Great value, great eats!"}
{"text":"It could have been a really good experience but the service ruined it all. I would recommend everyone to double check what they are ordering."}
{"text":"I squeezed in at the end and the sauce had excellent flavor, and they served it well... I did think it was a little pricey but location is the cause..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Sunday night before a show at TI.  We decided to go here based on the reviews, but also because it was close and convenient for us.  As luck would have it a table for two opened up and we were able to be seated right away!  All-in-all, not a bad dinner, but it didn't blow either of us away.  I think it was because of our selections...  Started the meal with the FANTASTIC garlic knots... boy were they tasty.  We then shared the meatballs and chicken marsala.  The meatballs were very moist and flavorful and the sauce was top notch.  The chicken marsala is were we had the biggest issues.  It simply lacked flavor.  There wasn't enough marsala and the chicken itself wasn't seasoned.  The accompanied pasta was bland as well.  After that miss, we skipped on dessert.  With all the great restaurants in Vegas, I'm not sure I will be back to this one.  It's a shame we didn't have a better experience, since there are great reviews.  That's why I think we just made a wrong choice with the chicken..."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! First of all let me say I'm super picky when it comes to Italian food -- I love it but I'm so picky. So I wasn't sure how'd this place would be.   The bread they serve is so yummy~ and I think it's all you can eat so that won me over. I shared the spaghetti with my mom and dad and we all had enough. It was pretty good... I keep craving it actually and I want to go back to Vegas just to eat it!! My other family members got the pizza, a salad, and ____ they all loved it.   My aunt and uncle said it's the best they've had since they used to live in Italy. So it's gotta be good!!   I was happy to hear the staff speaking Italian to each other, it really gave it a more unique feel."}
{"text":"Excellent food but very poor service. For the prices I expected a higher level of service. I felt like I was at a cafe style, rather than a resturant. They are very slow and others seemed to feel the same."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and sat in the outdoor area. The food and wine were great, and the complimentary garlic knots were HUGE. Pricing is the only thing that kept me from rating this place higher. Some of the basic pasta dishes are a bit pricey, but it IS Downtown Summerlin, so it was kind of expected."}
{"text":"This place is so exceptional...have to get the garlic bread with olive oil, they are so good! I ordered linguine clam with white wine sauce, it was like a clam party on a plate. We all agreed that this is the best meal on our whole Vegas trip. MUST TRY!! You will not regret!"}
{"text":"Everything was great from the food to the service. The meal started with delicious bread, yes, the bread was amazing, and it only got better from there. I don't go to Las Vegas often but when I do I will come back here."}
{"text":"Kind of  disappointed... wahhh  My expectations for the garlic knots were way too high.  I thought they were going to be warm freshly baked soft bread... they took a while to come, and I saw the server pull them out of some metal container thing which I thought was a little oven or something... The knots were barely warm, I don't even want to use the word \"warm\", but yeah... sad.  I believe they were tossed in some oil, herbs and garlic.  hmm oily cold bread.. meh.  I ordered the chicken marsala which I did not find anything special about.  It was rather bland and the sauce was not sticking to the pasta.  I also tried a bite of the bolognese and was not wowed by it either.  The pasta didn't really seem to absorb any flavor.  I was pretty sad because I wanted to try this place and dragged my friends there.  Most of them seemed \"meh\" about the food.  On the other hand, I tried my friend's lobster ravioli, and I really enjoyed it.  There were chunks of lobster inside, and the creamy sauce coated the ravioli well.  I would recommend this dish.  This restaurant is located near the shops.  You can also get there walking through the food court that's next to the parking structure (it is behind the Coffee Bean at the shops, not by the escalators).  It's pretty small but could fit a big party, as we had 10 people and there were still a few other open tables.  Service was good.  I called a little ahead to reserve a table for a late lunch, and we did not have to wait at all."}
{"text":"5 stars for the filet mignon meatballs.  DIVINE.  Best meatballs I've ever had!  So flavorful and yet simple with a simple marinara sauce accompaniment...  5 stars also for the garlic knots!! OMG... so buttery bad for you but so good.  The pasta here is fresh but not memorable.  Wine list is extensive for such a tiny tiny eaterie that spills onto the mall floor.  They do have a few by-the-glass options.  MEATBALLS!  If possible, just come here for the meatballs.  It's so worth it......"}
{"text":"This place was great! We did not wait long for a seat and the staff were fun and friendly. The food was yummy. We ordered the ravioli stuffed lobster, filet mignon meatballs, and stagioni pizza every dish was delic. Entree prices were between $15-25. We will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Hubby picked this place for dinner, and I'm so glad he did. This was the best dinner here. Yeah it's just Italian food, but the service was so great, I could write forever about it! I won't though, because I'll bore most of you. But our server knew what we wanted and finished our sentences. He was attentive and just very experienced and perfect. Our meal was great and the bread that comes with was excellent. The wine made us giddy for the next two hours. I would come back here again and again!"}
{"text":"A-ok pretty much sums up this Italian restaurant hidden in the back recesses of the Venetian. It's moderately priced and the food is just ok. The pizzas are more authentic which is nice, but don't get the gluten free crust, it's nasty. (and really aren't they all??)   The calamari was good and the wine selection was acceptable. I would have wanted more selections, especially more ITALIAN selections from an Italian place, but like I said acceptable.   The desert was quite good and I would have ordered more had I known it was going to be my favorite part of the meal. The after dinner drink selection leaves something to be desired, however.   On top of all of this our service was terrible. Eric was not friendly, greeted us with a strange sense of annoyance and skepticism and was not prompt about his service. The entire time I felt like I was in his way and not welcome. It was very uncomfortable.   Anyway, I know there are other servers, but there are also other Italian restaurants, I probably wont' be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. Both times I've gotten great service and the food is delicious. They bring out complimentary garlic bread and it's so good! We ordered calamari (crispy, fresh, delicious), gnocchi with bolognese sauce (my favorite and perfectly cooked) and hubby had linguine with clam sauce (he said it was great). Great decor, ambiance and location! (next to movie theater and close to parking) Food is a bit pricey for what it is but I don't mind it being a special night out."}
{"text":"Lyndsay our waitress was amazing from the very beginning. Very warm, friendly & welcoming!! Tables allow children to color, which is great!!! The food us exceptional. Fresh, authentic and simple. This is the only Italian restaurant with canolis. Must have!!!!!"}
{"text":"This truly is a delicious pizza. We stayed at a hotel nearby and saw an advertisement dropped off under our room door. (Great Idea) We decided we were staying in and having drinks, playing cards and enjoying each others company. We decided pizza would be a great idea and boy was it. Not only were they quick, but the delivery person was nice and polite. The Pizza was great, wings were crispy and delicious. We have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place, as far as pizza goes. Lol. Definitely a place to order pizza."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner with the family after shopping. Very nice ambiance, live entertainment. The service is superb! Ordered a pizza which was suppose to come with ricotta, i appreciated that they handled the situation very professionally. Regardless of the missing ricotta on the pizza they quickly made us a new one to go & we still left as satisfied customers. The only con I had was the price, it was pretty pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"Food is a 10!! Our server, Domenico, was okay, but a little strange. Again, our pizza, arugula salad, and eggplant rollatinis were AMAZING, but watching Domenico touch our leftovers with his fingers while putting them into a to-go box was tough. Two stars off for that grossness. We intended to leave a $15 tip on a $53 bill, but took back $5 once we saw our food get manhandled.  I think we will be ordering from Uber Eats from now on instead of dining in."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this locally owned Italian restaurant four times since October.  My husband's family is Italian and the food here is like eating at Nannie's Sunday dinner.  The Veal Piccata is amazing."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. You'll read elsewhere, and it's true: they're generous with their calamari which is fresh and delicious. The filet mignon meatballs were naturally tender given the cut. I had the aglio e olio with chicken for my entree which I found good but not fantastic, but I had the luxury of polishing off my mother's and sister's clam linguine and carbonara respectively. I especially enjoyed the latter. For dessert, consider the carrot cake which we unanimously decided is one of the best, most sinfully moist ones we've had. It's also massive. Our waiter, Paolo was fantastic and added much to our experience. All in all, it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"We were starving after catching The Blue Man Group and decided to stay in the Venetian for dinner.  The restaurants in St. Mark's Square were buzzing and had at least 20-30 minute waits, so we decided to give Trattoria Reggiano a try.  It is off the main canal areas and is definitely lacking atmosphere compared to many of the other Venetian eateries.  I had hoped the tucked away location would mean excellent food to make up for the lack of glam, but unfortunately the restaurant didn't deliver.  My husband's wood fired pizza was good and had great flavor & tasty crisp crust, but my meatball panini was more like a hoagie and was just ok.  The meatballs lacked flavor and the hoagie style bun ended up soggy.  I definitely regretted not going for the pizza!  I felt it was pricey for the quality.  There are so many wonderful restaurants in Vegas that I would choose another.  Trattoria Reggiano left me wanting more."}
{"text":"The food was mostly great and the service was acceptable. They were very very hard to find and right off of the food court. The place is small and somewhat crowded but not too bad. We had to ask for bread which I believe should be brought without having to ask. It was delicious however. My wife ordered the lasagna, which they were out of (I'm still not sure how an Italian restaurant is out of lasagna). She ended up with the spaghetti meatball plate which was very tasty. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo truffle, which they were also out of. The substitute was passable but nothing great. Overall I would try it again and hope for a little better, more friendly service as well as a more complete menu."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service was great. Drinks never got empty. John our server was very helpful and friendly! Would come again!"}
{"text":"I was with the GF looking for a light lunch on our last day at the Venetian.  After scrolling some reviews, this place sounded good and convenient so we took a seat \"outside.\"  It took us a while to find it since it's tucked away, but if you find the coffee bean, it's right there.  Wait staff was good and I'd give this place 4 stars if you want a quick pre-show bite or you're not worried about the ambiance.  That said, you're butted up against your neighbors and I was having to stare at a $150 gorilla suit and a crazy magician trying to sell a disappearing light that got old after 30 minutes (they have a magic shop next door). NOT A GOOD DATE PLACE, it's a cafe.  The tables are small and a bit cluttered (I don't need an industrial size of balsamic and olive oil, but I do need a plate to put it in).  The garlic bread knots were good, but as stated below, room temperature which took a bit away from them.  I do not agree with the other reviews as I thought the balsamic vinegar is a bit sweet for my taste.  The GF got hot tea and it was a packet of the cheapest tea in existence (I don't know that they get many people asking for tea, so wont dwell on that one.  We started with the warm baby spinach with goat cheese on flat bread, it was ok, I'm not a big fan of flat bread that's soggy in dressing, but the first couple were decent.  We split the spaghetti with meatballs which equated to a meat ball each with spaghetti.  It wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about either.  In short, it's a decent quick & easy bite for relatively cheap in the Venitian.  For better Italian, check out Enoteca San Marco or Postrio's pasta dishes in St Mark's square."}
{"text":"Calamari perfect and fresh. Mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes should be paired with a nice glass of wine. Their garlic bread was Amazing."}
{"text":"Very small establishment - probably has twenty tables most of which are located in front of the restaurant (in the mall area next door to a magic shop with a stuffed pink gorilla). The bread was tasty, but served cool/room temperature. Serving the bread hot would have kicked it up a notch. We weren't given a plate for olive oil, so we took one from the adjacent table. The food was decent. Ordered the lobster ravioli and thought the sauce was tasty. Granted we arrived 45 minutes prior to closing, I will pardon the waitress & waiter (we had two individuals checking on us - we were a party of 4 - attentive, pleasant service) for not offering us dessert."}
{"text":"We had Such a amazing experience! Sergio made the experience a million times better . The food was so amazingly great. True Italian dinning . I definitely recommend this restaurant. Thank for the amazing experience Sergio!!"}
{"text":"I was unimpressed. The service was disinterested. The food was average. My husband ordered gluten free pasta, but we're fairly sure he was not given gluten free pasta because he was ill afterwards and we were not charged the additional *$5.00* when the bill arrived. If you are gluten free whether by choice or by necessity, be sure to check."}
{"text":"Final dinner during this trip and the best. The food was even better than most restaurants we tried on Italy. Tiramisu was the highlight and must try."}
{"text":"Shock and awe at how great this place was. I always have low expectations with Italian restaurants, but I knew this place would be a winner after they brought out the bread basket. Top notch! I ordered the linguini cabonar I believe, it was delicious! I also tried the spaghetti and meatballs which was also tasty. Overall it was some of the best Italian food I have had and completely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"We read good reviews and went in for lunch in here. It was our Christmas lunch so we were extra generous and patient about everything. The ambience was nice inside the resturant and they had some space outside as well giving the feel of an European street side cafes or resturant. We had ordered spaghetti from the pasta menu and a margarita from the pizza menu. They had decent collection of wine but we went for a cocktail which was nice and refreshing. They had served some complimentary bread which I was very very surprised as it did not taste well at all. Spaghetti was good and the sun dried tomato sauce was very yummy. The pizza was very very average, I would go for a corporate company pizza over this any day. The dough and thus the crust did not taste good at all. All in all I would not recommend this place for pizza and bread crust related food items."}
{"text":"Venetian is full of Italian restaurants, but this one stood out for us to try because it was small and intimate.  It turned out to be a very enjoyable dining experience, a vegas-sized \"street side\" intimate dinner.  We had simple pasta dishes cooked right (al dente!) and having reasonable prices made it even better.  =)  The waiter even had an Italian accent.  cute! woot.  Conclusion:  Simple dishes for a decent price with a satisfied stomach p.s.  We should have been smart like other couples and SPLIT ONE pasta dish, instead of being lil' piggies and ordering one each.  hahahhahaha"}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers have yet to steer me wrong   Trattoria Reggiano was an absolute delight as our last meal in Vegas. The flavors and consistency of their sauces is what going out for Italian is all about! I had the Baked Ziti entree with a side salad- caesar of course. My friend ordered the tortellini alfredo.  We arrived without a reservation around 930pm on a Friday night. We were seated immediately with no issues. There were a variety of menu options to choose with a primary focus on pasta and pizza dishes. Prices very between $10-22 depending on your level of hunger. But considering it's Vegas (inside the Venetian hotel at that) the prices were moderately fair.   Our server was very attentive and courteous throughout our visit and the service was excellent. I would say we were in and out within 45mins-- I'm serious.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot for an inexpensive, highly satisfying Italian dinner. The walk along the way also helps too. Soo many photo ops!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this Trat.   Visiting Las Vegas last week, we wanted an intimate dinner before seeing The Phantom at the Venetian, and the Trattoria Reggiano is only a moment's walk from the theater. In light of the other reviews here, it seemed an inspired choice. It was less than that.   On arrival, on a not-terribly-busy Thursday evening after the theater - about 9 PM - it looked terribly inviting: Tables in the walkway as if a true Italian trat, and a few booths and tables inside near the open kitchen. Charming. We asked the Maitre' d for a booth (it helps my hearing, which is very poor), and were told we would not have it, and were shown to a table inside by the wall. OK, but a disappointment, even though it saved me $10 top to the Maitre' d, who seemed oblivious.    Delicious bread, with decent oil and vinegar, rapidly arrived, as did our waiter, who I asked for a recommendation between the spaghetti with meatballs (\"filet mignon\") and the linquine bolognese. \"Eh!\" He said. \"It's the same sauce, just not in a meatball.\"  Ummmm. The staff says the food is the same?  Disquieting.   My pasta and my wife's Ziti arrived almost immediately, as we were still on our first piece of bread. Good service is not the same as fast service; this isn't Pasta Now, but a relaxing meal. Still, it was hot and freshly prepared. The Bolognese was tasty, and (as usual) I ate half, expecting to take it back to our room for lunch the next day. My wife, who eats like a bird, ate about a quarter of her Ziti, and as the second waiter came to remove our dishes, I said, \"It was delicious, but we want to take it with us.\" He nodded and left.   A few moments later, our waiter returned with a check - strangely, for an Italian restaurant, without asking if we wanted dessert - and I asked, \"Where is our food.\" I got blank looks; the second waiter said, \"Thrown out.\"  Argument follows. Finally, the headwaiter said, \"Wait. We'll recook for you.\" This time, it takes longer, but when the bag returns, there are two tins inside; I look in the top one, and find bread. \"Where is my linguine?\" I ask. Blank looks all over again. More argument. Finally, another recook, we take the food, and leave.   The service is obviously challenging, perhaps due in part to there being several languages and accents going on among the staff. The food was good, but not great; the meat sauce lacked seasoning (garlic is not all there is in this world). The Ziti was nice, but as it sat on the table, the cheese started changing from gentle yellow to bright orange. \"Cheese powder, perhaps?\" said my wife. But it was good, albeit a bit incandescent in appearance.  The ambiance was very good, with a slight hint of New York Italian as a result of the dark stained booths.   Overall, better than the food court next door, but not the place for the intimate and relaxing after-theater supper that many might wish."}
{"text":"Took a few minutes to find, but well worth it! From the second we arrived the hostess quickly made us feel very comfortable and had us seated immediately. Our waiter, John, was super awesome! He was very attentive and his personality made our dinner that much more special. As for the food, amazing...the garlic bread rolls, the lasagna and the chicken parmigiana (chicken was extra delish!) Highly recommend, both for service and food!"}
{"text":"My husband is quite Italian and quite picky when it comes to food!! Trattoria is our \"stop before the movies\" in downtown Summerlin mall. Easy to get to, simply valet at the movies and a few steps your there! Indoor/Outdoor concept and super during this time of year.  Bar is extensive, food has always been amazing and seems like employees love it here because we see the same ole faces :)  Stop by and I would recommend the blackened Ceaser salmon salad for those counting calories + a glass of merlot.  Fun Fact: Did you know the dough for their pizzas are imported from New York!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food. Not what you would expect in a food court. Filet mignon meatballs are phenomenal and the garlic knots are hard to stop eating."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was phenomenal, a great deal for being within the venetian, authentic Italian cuisine, desert was great, all around a great place for dinner; very reasonable, lots to offer! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The best gluten free pizza in town. You can sit outside on the patio, sometimes they have live music  the servers especially Britt knows her craft!!! Bravo"}
{"text":"Had a friend in town and we wanted to go someplace different.  So since she was staying at Red Rock so we chose italian.  Truly great food, good wine selection and a very cool spot with indoor and outdoor seating.  Great service too.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"In the mood for Italian food before seeing a show. We decided to try Trattoria Reggiano in Downtown Summerlin. The ambience he's quite nice. You can choose between eating Outdoors on the patio or inside. Both good options. The service was excellent. The complimentary garlic knots  that they serve  at the beginning of the meal  a truly outstanding . Unfortunately the rest of the food did not rise to that level. For my entree I chose the chicken marsala. It comes with a side of pasta. The chicken was chewy and the flavor blah. My wife went with the meatball baked ziti. Also very mediocre. My buddy order the lasagna. He had difficulty eating it and rated it as poor at best. I gave it three stars rather than less because of the garlic knots and the outstanding service period but I certainly would not return here when there were so many other options for good quality Italian food in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious! I really enjoyed this place and the service! The manager came over to our table during one visit to check in with us and was extremely attentive and friendly. I could go back every night just for the garlic knots. I've never had the pizza here but can tell you the pasta meals and appetizers (chicken parm and marsala and the fried calamari) are amazing! Not a large wine selection unless you buy by the bottle which is a bummer for me, but still worth the trip! WOULD LOVEEEE gift cards available for here... especially with the holidays coming up. Also would LOVE a to go menu. With gift cards and to go menus, this place would be that much more amazing. Gift cards please!! :)"}
{"text":"We purchased discount tickets at tix 4 tonight that provided 50% off our main entree. We were not disappointed.  My Caprese salad was delicious with the most creamy mozzarella cheese I've ever had. The baby green salad was big enough to share. The garlic rolls were warm and wonderful. We ordered Chicken Parmigiana and Chicken Masala.  Both dishes arrived freshly made and hot. Our waiter, Paolo, was attentive and adorable.  The location of the restaurant was difficult to find. It's near the food court which seems a bit misplaced. I would definitely return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Have passed by this restaurant for years ....but never will again.  The service is prompt, the food is authentic and delicious, and without all the Vegas hype and $$$$$$."}
{"text":"I rarely find myself in the mood for Italian, and after visiting this restaurant, I've realized that I've done myself a disservice.  I wonder why the restaurant occupies such a small space when in fact the experience it offers is absolutely sublime. We didn't get very far past the garlic rolls to finish our ravioli and the spaghetti entree. They were awesome in their own right, but what really stole the show were the rolls.  In fact, the garlic rolls were so awesome, we asked the service person to bag what rolls we couldn't finish. To our delightful surprise in our hotel room, we realized they gave us a full serving of rolls!!!  The real server was our bus boy. He was attentive to all of our needs and was practically a super serving robot. Our waiter, not so much."}
{"text":"Wow ! Had dinner there again last night . The bar was hoping and the drinks were flowing . Jennifer the bartender followed me around the bar and offered me a drink when there were no seats .  They've added live music and added several new dishes . My wife had the Dover sole and I had the veal Milanese .  Both were generous portions and excellent. Highly recommended !!!  Just an update to my previous review . We visited this establishment again this week and probably had the best eggplant appetizer . Perfectly cooked covered in delicious red gravy and cheese . Mmm Best of all was the service , ambiance and of course the prices .  It's the most authentic Italian restaurant in town ."}
{"text":"By far the best the value on the strip for authentic Italian cuisine . The service is provided by an experienced staff members who make sure you are well taken care of .  The eggplant is out of this world and the pasta is perfectly cooked.  It's a not to be missed placed in Vegas ."}
{"text":"Our group got food poisoning from eating here. The service was great, but we got so sick afterwards we can never come back.   Stay AWAY! there are many other options for eating in the Venetian"}
{"text":"Experience was delightful!! Victor was amazing! Dora is the manager was attentive and so kind! The food was outstanding! The kale and peanut salad was a 10, and for a small salad it was generous for 2!  The linguine bolognese was outstanding. Great service and amazing staff  One of our highlights in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food and the service was incredibly bad. I sent the pasta back and I should have also protested over the horrible sword fish dish. I relied on the recommendation of the concierge at the Venetian for an Italian restaurant. Did I forget to mention that I was looking for good Italian food?"}
{"text":"the best italian restaurant i have ever had. We ordered linguine (in Clam Sauce)and spaghetti Aglio are FANTASTIC!  a must try in Las Vegas, Its much better than any buffet here"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. The rolls were a bit too garlicky for my taste.  I mixed up with a combo that wasn't on the menu. Big mistake.  The service was very gracious and attentive.  I think you should order what others did."}
{"text":"Sun @6:15pm, I was within a party of 5 and pressed for time to make our gondola ride (in 45 min). Victor was very mindful by making sure were were taken care of and on our way in a timely matter. This did not take away from the quality of the food which was great! Victor was very attentive and helpful. We were able to enjoy 3 large appetizers (eggplant, soup, and calamari) in addition to the entrees. Don't typically care for eggplant and it was delicious! Calamari was fresh and also delicious. Table garlic bread also delicious.  I will be returning for great food and service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Quaint and tucked away this ristorante serves decent portions with awesome taste. The head patrons are friendly and serve to please. I ordered steak and it was sliced up at serving but it was really moist and flavourful.   Others in my party were pleased with the pasta. The large antipasto however is not good. Prosciutto, cheese, olives  were good but mortadella  and salami do not constitute a good antipasto. Too many pickled peppers just to make the platter look full. All around it was all good."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. Spectacular Italian food. Chicken Parm and Cheese Ravoili is our go to dinner. Wendy the GM is a dream and treats you like family. Bethany tends bar and is the sweetest person we have met since moving to Las Vegas. Always friendly and goes out of her way to make every visit the best part of the day"}
{"text":"Sick of the buffet food we searched out a restaurant that was closer to the room in the Palazzo. I used my phone to locate something with decent reviews and found this place. It was kind of tucked back in the hotel compared to some of the other places we walked past.   Once I got past the fact I felt like I was eating in a hallway of a shopping mall and paying $25 a plate for that luxury, I had fun. They were busy and we waited for the table we got. All of us ordered the spaghetti with filet Mignon meatballs. The two meatballs were a decent size. My dad said he wished they had put more sauce on the pasta, which I think I could have agreed.   The drinks comes in cans or bottle so don't expect a regular refill situation here. I ordered unsweetened iced tea and got the largest bottle on the table. The food came out quick. It all felt kind of rushed. The minute your fork was down they were taking your plate away. I enjoyed it, but I would not eat there again even though I gave them four stars. I think there are too many other places to pick from that don't give the frantic feel while you eat. The owner did come out and take our order and was very nice. They were all very nice to us."}
{"text":"I have dined at this restaurant a few times now. I have always been very satisfied. The food is absolutely scrumptious and cooked to perfection. My favorites are the meatballs, rollatini, and any of the seafood dishes. Whether dining with my wife or with friends Trattoria Reggiano is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"- I would come back JUST for the Complimentary garlic knots at the start of our meal. They were huge, fluffy, buttery, garlicky pieces of heaven that definitely filled me up because I ate 2...whoops! - Penne vodka was a solid choice and had a sweet vodka sauce topped with prosciutto - Chicken Alfredo was decent, not the best I have ever had as the sauce was a little thin but the flavor was delicious and rich - Caprese salad came with a generous portion of mozarella and it was wonderfully creamy in the middle, tomatoes were just ok. Make sure to add balsamic vinegar as it did not come with any and their vinegar was divine!!!  - Hefty prices but at least it came with generous portions of pasta - We added chicken to each of our pasta dishes which was an additional $6 and the chicken made the pasta a bit soggy and watered down. It would have been nice if the chicken was sliced into strips instead of coming out as a whole breast  Our lunch was $90 and we didn't even order any alcohol - pretty steep but it IS vegas... Service was just ok. Started out good as she rushed to take our order but then we had to flag her down for boxes and the check. It definitely hit the spot for our pasta craving but we weren't blown away by the pasta. We might come back on our next Vegas trip to try their meatballs since that seems to be their specialty."}
{"text":"Came in to town for the weekend and found this place on yelp. The best decision ever!!! I will fly out to vegas just to have dinner there again! Everything was delicious, from the garlic knots, the salad , to the main entree, even their water was amazing. Great service as well. We will be going back again and again!"}
{"text":"I went to Trattoria Reggiano on the strength of its Yelp reviews. How could so many people be wrong?  First, the restaurant is located within the Venetian Hotel, which is like a maze inside. Even a map is unhelpful and we had to constantly ask people where to go to find the place.  When we walked in the waiter asked us are we ready for some \"real Italian food.\" If his statement was right I never want to have it again. First we had Spaghetti and Meatballs, Pasta with Bolognese sauce and Chicken Francese. The Bolognese sauce and chicken had no seasoning. Literally the chicken tasted like absolutely nothing not even a hefty dose of salt and pepper could save those two dishes. The Spaghetti sauce tasted like it came out of a can. On top of that almost everything is in the $20 range. There are so many better Italian restaurants in Vegas than this place.  This was our last meal in the city before we went home. What a way to go out on a bad note."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here on Saturday night. We were visiting from out of town and staying at a nearby resort. We wanted Italian, but wanted to get out of the hotel. This place was close and had some good reviews. We are so glad that we decided to eat here!!  Our server was fantastic. The receipt said \"Dominico\" but I forgot to look at his name tag. Anyway, he was an older gentleman with an accent. He made great recommendations and steered us exactly where we wanted to go. We ended up ordering the Italian Kale salad to start and let me tell you....it was amazing! Then we got the Lobster Ravioli for our main course and it was fantastic as well. We were both very impressed. There was also live music and it was perfect.  We only make it to Vegas about 2 times/year and I can't wait to come back to enjoy another meal here. Next time we will make sure to save room for a cannoli!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing...marble countertops, full bar, fans pulling fresh breezes, and tv's with the latest sports. However, as a mid-level wine lover the wine list suffers. Especially the white wine...no Sauv Blancs, no non oaked chardonnays, no Albarinos, no white burgundys...if you're going to be a good Italian restaurant in LV....have a great wine list!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food that even my kids enjoyed!!!. We had a Caprese salad for our appetizer that was great. Some of the freshest basil and creamiest cheese ever. The garlic knots are hot and fresh and with the complimentary cheese, olive and marinated peppers, a great start. Our entrees were piping hot, great taste and filling. We had chicken parmesan, baked ziti and meatballs. All were fantastic. Desert was great !  Finally found a good cannoli and Tiramisu. The price point is a little high, but the location has to be factored in.My only complaint is that my wife substituted whole wheat pasta and charged $2.oo without letting us know. I would pay , but just let me know."}
{"text":"I am in Vegas a lot for business and stay at the Venetian often. I discovered this place in January and have eaten here every trip, including ones where I didn't stay in the hotel (5 or 6 times now). The linguini with clam sauce is the best I've had anywhere. But tonight when I ordered it, my waiter who I think is one of the owners, said no the clams were not good today so he wasn't serving it. That is service with integrity. I had the eggplant parm instead. Solid. Also, the filter mignon meatballs are to die for.  I love this place. Fantastic food, great service. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place just just so...bland. My eggplant parmesan, though a very large dish, was unsatisfying. Very few spices used, and the ingredients just didn't seem fresh. Additionally, everyone in my party had huge stomachaches after going here-we have no idea what from. And it was pretty overpriced for what it was. I had picked this for my birthday meal and was very disappointed. The service was lacking, too- it seemed like we were a bother to the waiter every time we waved him over.  Oh well, maybe we'll choose better next time."}
{"text":"This place have good Yelp rating so we gave it a try. We were very disappointed with the food. The shish kabob was the worst I have ever had. The texture of half of the meat was more like apple than beef. They were a little crunchy. I should have sent it back to the kitchen."}
{"text":"I was staying at red rock this week and went to see downtown summerlin Thursday night. I stumbled upon this restaurant because I could hear the music outside. My friend and I went into eat and loved everything. The staff was so friendly and our waitress Rikki was amazing. We ordered everything she recommended starting with the eggplant rollatini . Our main meal was chicken Francsisse and we finished with ricki's favorite tiramisu. The restaurant outside was a little busy but Rikki was so attentive you would have thought we were the only table around. She definitely loves her job and it shows. I'm coming back to town next month and I will absolutely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly. Food was delicious. Will definitely come here again the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Eats more like a little Italian restaurant in your home town rather than one of a thousand in Vegas. Highly recommend the Filet Mignon meatballs they were Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant, emphasis on little. Great rolls to start.... they have been dredged in olive oil but I still dipped them in olive oil and grated parmesan. I ordered the linguine filet mignon bolognese and I have to admit it was pretty good. I would give it 3.50 for the food alone. I have to knock off a half star because of the environment. Ambiance is nice and quaint but one of the waiters was pretty snippy with his fellow staff and b/c the place is soooo small it was hard to ignore. At one point it was uncomfortable but it seems that they were oblivious.   Would I come back? Yes"}
{"text":"This is some pretty descent food for being in the middle of a hotel mall... great people watching when you sit in the cafe seating and I have to say that the garlic rolls are really good."}
{"text":"It's a small place and as such it's not always to get a table without a long wait but it's worth it.  Crazy good.  The filet mignon meatballs were outstanding... best meatballs I've ever had.  The veal parmigiana was to die for.  Literally amazing.  Some good red table wins and remarkably inexpensive for Las Vegas... like it's actually reasonable!    Do yourself a favor and put this on your list.  It's a great place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 6:30pm for dinner. Surprisingly they had a lot of open tables, so we got seated right away!  After we ordered, our server brought us a basket of garlic cheesy bread with olive oil and black vinegar. The bread was warm and delicious!  For the appetizer, we got the filet mignon meatballs. There were 3 big meatballs in marinara sauce. I thought they tasted good but really tasted like normal meat balls to me but a little softer? I'm not really sure haha.  For the entree I got the lobster ravioli. They were very generous with the amount of lobster. The ravioli was delicious and the filling tasted like some kind of cheese with lobster! The sauce was an orange colored lobster sauce.  The ambiance was quite nice. This is in the Venetian so you kind of do get the feeling that you're in Venice. Also the server was very very kind and attentive!   We left super full! The servings here are very generous. It is a little pricey though, since the total for our meal + tip for 4 people was around $140."}
{"text":"This place is amazing from the garlic knots to the atmosphere.  Their bruschetta pizza is out of this world."}
{"text":"Jackpot!  If the slots aren't treating you well, at least you'll hit the jackpot here! After passing this place up many times before, I had to stop in on my most recent vegas trip.    It's easy to miss this place because it's located in the food court behind the Coffee Bean, but follow your nose and let your heart be your guide... either that or ask someone.  Filet Mignon Meatballs -  Holy meatballs!!! They're good.  The pomodoro sauce that the meatballs are served in is delicious but even without the sauce, the meat is tender, juicy and is filled with subtle flavors.   Penne in Vodka sauce - I had to get my alcohol in some how, even though it was only 11am.  The penne was cooked to al dente perfection, sauteed in a pink sauce with bits of prosciutto.  The prosciutto pieces are very small, so if you want some meat, make sure you opt in on adding the grilled chicken, shrimp, or meatball to your pasta order.  Gnocchi al Pesto - How do you say it? GnoKki? GEenotchi?  Doesn't matter, because once you start eating, you wont be saying anything except, \"MmmMM.\"  Probably one of the best gnocchi I've ever had and the pesto sauce is not too watery, not to thick -- divine.  I wish I had enough stomach room to try one of their desserts, but their good sized portions filled me up.  This place isn't \"cheap\" but it's so worth it.  So, why didn't this place get a 5 star rating?   The bread.   I am the queen of carbs and I love my breads.  The service bread looked like it would be amazing --buttery, golden brown, with parmesan.  But it was actually fairly dense and it wasn't warm.  I'm not sure if this is how they always serve their bread but if the bread was hot and soft, this place would merit a five star rating."}
{"text":"If you're looking for casual Italian, this is a good place to go.  I really wish I could complain more about this place because the waiter messed up my order, but the wrong item he brought me was really good.  Here's what happened: My friends asked the waiter what he recommended for pasta and he suggested some kind of pasta BOLOGnese, and they ordered that.  When he took my order, I said \"I'll also have the pasta BOLOGnese,\" I was craving pasta.  When our orders came, they got pasta dishes and I received something piled deep under green leaves.  Turns out he heard me order the Veal MILANese, and then he gave me attitude about it. Dude, you just recommended some bolognese stuff to half our table and I said I would also have that!  He did offer to replace the item, but I was too hungry to wait and didn't want my friends to wait for me to finish whenever I did get my replacement order, plus I already angered the guy that brings the food, so I wasn't going to risk it.  Conveniently for them, the Veal Milanese was one of the pricier entrees...  It should be a sign to you how good the food is that I gave them 4-stars despite my little kerfuffle.  Seriously, it was not easy trying to maintain a pissed-off front while eating that rather great Veal Milanese.  A lot has been mentioned about the quality of the bread, yes, it is also really good.  The pizzas aren't necessarily great, they're alright, we shared one as an appetizer, didn't really leave me craving more, I didn't even try to fight for the last slice.  Also, and this is very European of them, they serve the tiny-bottled sodas, meaning refills aren't free, and that is annoying.  To recap: great bread, good entrees, meh pizza, tiny sodas, and a waiter you should be REALLY clear with."}
{"text":"Turned away when more than half the restaurant was empty for \"reservations\" when I counted at least 10 empty tables. Was told the wait would be approx 2 hours! Went to CPK & walked by again about 45 minutes later, all tables still empty.... I understand how reservations take precedence as a former host, but a lot of people no show. I've never been turned away from a restaurant with this many empty tables before. Management seriously needs to reevaluate how you do business with walk ins."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. We've passed by in the past during our visits to LV but the place was always crowded. We got lucky this time and got a table for 4. I really liked my linguine with clams, not many places make it the way I like but their clams were very tiny, smaller than a quarter size, so not enough meat, $28. Hubby had a glass SV Cab, $11 and it was really good.  Our companions also liked their dinner: Eggplant parmesan, $20; Spaghetti carbonara, $22.  We shared a fried calamari appetizer and it was excellent. The rolls were good too and our friends could not finish their meal, so they asked for it to go and the waiter, Eric, was so nice that he brought her extra rolls.  Good service, good food.  Must come back next time in LV."}
{"text":"Such great food!  A small unassuming atmosphere with some of the most authentic Italian you'll find in Las Vegas.  Very reasonable prices.  Linquini with clams was super....sweet little neck clams.   Great meatballs, Caesar salad.  Went next day for lunch and sampled pizza, also excellent!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots were actual heaven on earth. And they were very generous with providing us more when (or even when we didn't) ask.   Started with a Caesar salad to share and the freshly cracked pepper really made the salad delicious.   I then had penne with the filet mignon meatballs and they were absolutely delicious. Perfect taste. Very flavorful.   It was nice to have such a quick yet delicious Italian restaurant within our hotel."}
{"text":"I ordered Fettucino Alfredo to go. For the low, low price of just $25, I got a 2 scoops of noodles in a tin container - no parmesan, no cutlery, no napkins. Adding insult to injury, the pasta was undercooked. A travesty by all measures... if someone DOES want to have a relaxing meal in the restaurant, they would have to try to find a spot that doesn't have sports TV's as a feature. Nice music and décor but really? The TV's are in poor taste. But then, so was the meal."}
{"text":"Comfortable Italian restaurant. Staff was polite and friendly, service is quick and attentive, food came out timely and hot. I recommend the Shrimp Stuffed with Crab Meat with Scampi sauce. Delicious. Attire is business casual."}
{"text":"This was our second time here and it was much busier than the first time we came but there was not a wait. Food took a long time to come out but we also didn't tell our waiter we had a movie to catch and our food wasn't going to make it out in time. We asked them to hold it for us and if we could pick it up afterwards. They kept it under the heater for us and the manager came by and offered us a $100 gift card for the inconvenience. It was our fault for not telling them we were going to a movie but the manager took it upon himself to accept responsibility. How amazing! We will definitely be back based on the customer service alone!   PS- meatballs and calamari are a must try!"}
{"text":"I loved this little restaurant in the main shops area at the Venetian. We went there for lunch and it wasn't crowded; not sure about dinner time though. It was small and cozy with enough tables to fit all 6 of us girls. The garlic rolls were free flowing (huge pieces of rolls) and the plates are big enough to share. We ordered four dishes: the lobster ravioli lunch special, spaghetti and meatballs, prosciutto di parma pizza (absolutely my fav) and the chicken balsamic salad. We even packed some up for the night."}
{"text":"Great Italian option at the Venetian - one of the less expensive places. Not glamorous but the food is really good!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave one star was for the calamari.  I didn't think it possible but this was hands down the worst attempt at white tablecloth Italian trattoria food ever.  The manager and wait staff were attentive and apologetic yet really baffled by our comments.  It's pricey as well however it's Vegas    I want to be more specific however every time my group of four chats about it we all get a wave of nausea.  Too bad.  Again the manager was awesome"}
{"text":"Wow! Great Food and Great Service.   Ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti was perfect and the meatballs had excellent flavor. The sauce was perfect.   The garlic not were served cold and would have been much better if served hot.   The waiter recommend an excellent bottle of wine and I ordered another to go, perfect.   I would definitely come back here to try some other food."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem..... Come on, Filet Mignon meatballs... NEED I SAY MORE?!?  I loved the sevice and food, we actually visited this restuarant twice during our say in Vegas.."}
{"text":"Was walking around Downtown Summerlin shopping and decided to try this amazing Italian place. We were greeting right away and sat outside on the patio. They had several heaters which was great.  Our server was also the bartender. She was super sweet and attentive.  They start you out with some awesome bread accompanied by olives, peppers and cheese! We ordered the meatballs, eggplant rigatoni and the sausage pizza.  Everything was absolutely delicious! For dessert we had the tiramisu which had to be one of the best in town!!! They also had live music which made it so much better. I love this place and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Cute patio with air!! I wish DT Summerlin wasn't such a concrete jungle- too hot even before summer has heated up. Good was quite tasty and service was good. Not sure about the free garlic knots with oil and balsamic for dipping? They were already pretty oily. Portions look small for lunch but don't be deceived, it was more than enough food but a little pricey for lunch. I had pasta with garlic, olive oil and cracked red pepper. The chef forgot to add the pepper and the waitress failed to notice so I had to ask for them to bring a shaker to the table. Simple flavors are an indicator of a chefs skill and the pasta was perfect and the sauce flavorful (can't believe they forgot an ingredient though). I'll definitely give them another chance- when summer is over ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Italian food. The bread was on point, food was unique, and restaurant has a great ambiance. This was a fun spot to try out in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation a little over a year ago and thought I died and went to food heaven lol. The garlic knots were to die for!!!had the tortellini Alfredo which was divine. Best Alfredo sauce I ever had and a chocolate cake for dessert for which I have no words. Absolutely delicious and a VERY large portion. The second time I came to Vegas I couldn't wait to go back but they were closed for renovation. :-(  however, I will be back by the end of the month and can't wait to give my taste buds what they have been craving. I really hope the food is still great."}
{"text":"The host was rude and violated ADA laws! My dog is trained for seizure responses, and I had paperwork from my doctor explaining everything. My dog was quietly sitting next to me while I handed the papers to the host, and he asked for an ID card. I explained to him ID cards are not real, people buy those online and are complete frauds. I even informed him that in the ADA website it clearly states IDs are not real. I had paperwork, a vest and leash that have giant letters imprinted \"SERVICE DOG\" but that was not enough. I told him that I could buy an ID card right now in front of him to show him that's not real. He said \"that's our policy. If you don't have an ID you can't eat anywhere.\" Yeah there's no way possible your policy is to break the law.   Oh and then he has the nerve to say \"oh I have a bichon frise at home. Is your dog a bichon? Looks just like mine.\" No jerk. My dog is a trained for responding to my medical emergency. Just because my dog is small like yours doesn't mean it's the same.   So glad there was another restaurant 1 minute away that knew the laws. Thank you to the unfriendly and untrained host for showing us a better restaurant.   Management, train your staff https://www.ada.gov/archive/qasrvc.htm"}
{"text":"I could not sing this place's praises enough. I've now been here about five times over the last four years (each time I go to Vegas with a different person heading here is an absolute must). I have never been disappointed. The place is tucked away in the Grand Canal Shoppes, it might take you some time to find it but trust me, it's well worth it.  Came here early on a Saturday night (5:30) knowing that the place would get crowded as the night went on and we could not have been happier. We (a table of 6) were seated right away and garlic knots were at our fingertips before we could blink. Our waiter was lovely and our dishes came quickly and everyone was overwhelmed by how delicious it was.   We tend to stick to cheaper places but everyone agreed the price was well worth how delicious the food was. Plus, on the strip $20 more or less a person for a great sit-down restaurant is one of the best deals you'll find. A really phenomenal place, if you're going to Vegas make sure to stop here for dinner."}
{"text":"We really wanted Italian food, didn't want to spend an arm and a leg and wanted it to be close to the Mirage where we were staying. Read the Yelp reviews and they were all over the place, some five star, some one, so decided since food is pretty subjective we'd give it a try.  It's in the middle of the restaurant row and it's not quiet by any means.  Service was prompt and our server was pleasant but had absolutely no sense of humor and apparently didn't get that smiling is a nice gesture.   We were immediately offered bread which instead of large hunks or bread sticks turned out to be rolls which were very good.  The server brought oil and balsamic to dip them in.  We each had a salad, big mistake.  They are huge and easily could be split.  Nothing to write home about, just a salad.  My husband who thinks the only Italian food is lasagna had that and said it was not bad.  Actually for him that's pretty high praise.  I had shrimp scampi which was strange to say the least.  Apparently I didn't read the description very well.  It was 7 shrimp sauteed in wine, garlic and butter which was fine, but then they topped that with some sort of odd stuffing.  I've never had shrimp scampi like that and I scraped the stuffing off after eating a bite.  The pasta is obviously home made and tasted very nice, cooked al dente but way too much pasta.  They have a nice wine list and I had a delicious pino grigio.  Would we go back again, probably not.  It was ok, just not great."}
{"text":"The concept seemed lovely with an indoor/outdoor feel, but the food will not make a repeat visitor out of me. The garlic knots and an antipasto plate were very nice, however the salads we ordered were entrée sized rather than starters-would have preferred half the size at half the price. The Kale salad with peanut dressing was difficult to eat as it was very spicy and very heavily dressed. The Margareta pizza my husband ordered which comes with no cheese (lactose intolerant) was COVERED in capers which were not mentioned anywhere. That is a very specific ingredient that serves mention on the menu. He is not a fan so rolled most off and ate half. I ordered salmon and vegetables-the preparation was fine although a lot of oil appeared on the plate mixed with the lemon sauce-not a fan of that much oil. The vegetables were heirloom squash and zucchini-really cute vegetables! Overall just very hefty priced and neither of us was impressed with our items. Perhaps the pasta is the way to go as there is a very authentic vibe-but we'll pass on by next time in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"This was a petty good resteraunt located in the Venetian. It's a little hard to find it but just ask a worker. The bread is delicious. Really liked our waiter Sergio. I got the Alfredo and my husband got the chicken parm. Husband wasn't crazy about chicken but loved the spaghetti."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after driving all the way from Florida. Four of us sat down and placed our order, and then our waitress Hilga disappeared after that. Thirty minutes have now passed and our beers and drinks are empty but no food is present. Finally flag our server down and she looks at us and tells us yeah yeah it's coming it's on the way and she didn't even refill our drinks! Later, she comes back with a notepad and asks each of us what we ordered and began to write it down! 45 minutes in and she hadn't even given our order to the kitchen. Our server was replaced and they gave us a free antipasti platter that we didn't even want - we just wanted our food at this point. No one touched the platter at all. Our food finally came and we were approached by the manager offering us one cannoli or one slice of cheesecake for the four of us to split. One dessert for four people after sitting there for an hour waiting for our food! When the bill came, there were no apologies and no comping on any of our meals, and the food here isn't cheap at all. Hilga has been our server two times in the past and after the third time, we won't be coming back until she is gone."}
{"text":"This place was an utter disappointment.  We had difficulties finding it, and the staff would not answer our repeated phone calls. The food was extremely greasy and resembled something you'd find on a foodcourt menu. There was a limited selection... If you're looking for a good Italian dinner then I suggest you move on to the next review. Thank god the wine was on par."}
{"text":"Delish! Excellent service.  Calamari, eggplant parm, veal bolognese, veal parm, and cannelini bean soup: delicious. WARNING: serving portions are huge.  Share if you can."}
{"text":"Hosted a business lunch there last week, we planned ahead and made a reservation due to having 6 in our group. We were seated as soon as we arrived, and drinks were delivered rapidly. That was about the best part of the rest of the meal. Five of us ordered various salads and one ordered a pasta dish. We waited more that 40 minutes for our food. Once arrived is was good but certainly not worth the wait and not a place to consider for a work related lunch if you are short on time."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time four stars, this time two. It would have been less but Beth came in to save the day! The first time 4 stars due to the horrible tiramisu. This time I would have given 1 star but like I said Beth, the bartender, came in and made the experience so much better with her great personality and social skills. Ricki our \"server\" was not attentive, OVER charged us, did not bring our antipasto (I had to ask the manager for it). We were there early, at 4pm, when happy hour starts. I recommend waiting until the bartender comes in at 5pm. The restaurant was not busy, there were us and 2 other tables, 6 people total. If you can go Wednesday through Sunday Beth works then, she is amazing. So helpful, always recommending, attentive, pleasant, sociable, etc... Just a fabulous gal all around. This is what I want when sitting at the bar. The kale salad was fabulous, as was the pizza. Last time we were here the Bolognese and calamari was fabulous. The food is outstanding, but Ricki is horrible. If you hate your job, stay home!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Chicken Parm is huge. Bread is great but don't fill up because portions are very big. Francesco is a great waiter."}
{"text":"We had an exceptionally great meal here. I had not been to Italy at that point but would later realize that like many of Rome's sidewalk cafes, the food is fresh, aromatic and so delicious.  Above is a ceiling painted to appear like the sky. You will find it after walking past all the shops and if your lucky you will pass living statues and people dressed in baroque/Renaissance costumes. It is very entertaining to sit 'outside' eventhough it only looks like you're outside. The prices are great for it being Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews. But the fact this restaurant received 4+ stars is beyond me. First. Olive oil and balsamic vinegar is nearly not palatable.   Costco 's organic Olive oil and balsamic is 100x better. The filet mignon meatballs was good. However the sauce was basic and not much flavor. The lobster ravioli tasted like it came from trader Joe's.   When I inquired about where the pasta came from. .. she looked beWildered and said it's from Italy.  Fresh frozen? ??"}
{"text":"Yummy food. Sam was an awesome waiter. The garlic knots were wonderful. The outside sitting area will be a great place to sit in nice weather. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"I am so very happy we went in to this AMAZING place today with my son for lunch! Very pleasant atmosphere, quite, clean, excellent service and attitude. We got all attention, everything was served just right on time, simply delicious! Pizza is just not comparable with retailer's or other restaurants, hand made, thin crust, smells and looks so yammy. Thank you, the owner and our server. We will be back to this little Italy!"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner here on Sunday. We were looking for a reasonably priced dinner option and this place looked promising. Had a bit of a wait (20 mins) before being seated. I was impressed with the wait system, they text you when your table is ready which allows you to wander the grande canal shoppes while you wait.  We were seated and our orders taken quickly. Nice warm bread served with EVOO and balsamic to start. Shared a caprese salad to start. Definitely a shareable portion. Buffalo Mozzarella was creamy. Tomatoes were a bit mealy.  I had the spaghetti puttanesca. Yum. Lots of good things like capers and olives. It had anchovies but they weren't overpowering. My mom ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs are their specialty and it showed. They were juicy and flavorful. Portion sizes are generous. Both of us had trouble finishing our mains.  Not super cheap -- dinner for 2 without wine and only one app was $80. But overall a solid dining experience. If I was craving home style Italian I'd go again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and looking for a place that took room charges/comps. Wife and I ordered the Caesar salad, calamari, linguini in white clam sauce, and baked ziti with a side of meatballs. The calamari was great, but the portions were enough for probably 4 people as an appetizer. My linguini with white clam sauce was good and my wife thoroughly enjoyed all her food. Overall great experience in this small restaurant. It was a loud atmosphere so I wouldn't suggest it as a romantic date but a great place to catch dinner. Bill came out to $85 bucks with tip so not cheap but not too pricey considering what we ordered."}
{"text":"It was awesome!!! The food was very good!! And I loved my server Rodolfo and Hilda and Tony and Bethany but most of ALL GM WAS THE BEST VITO!!!!!  I would reccomended to anyone !"}
{"text":"I was attracted to this place because it really reminded me of the small restaurants in Venice, Italy. This is a small place, a few tables inside and a few tables outside; we chose inside because i thought outside could be a little noisy. We LOVED this meal. Granted, we had basic items -  however everything was delicious and the waitress was superb. My husband and I split a Caesar salad and split the eggplant parmigiana entree. Dad had spaghetti and meatballs. Loved(!)  the bread and the bottle of Bon Anno Cabernet. of course, i had to try the tiramisu which did not disappoint. We can't wait to return to Las Vegas and have another meal here. The total including the wine ($48/bottle) and tip was $128.00. I highly recommend this place for those seeking an excellent Italian meal."}
{"text":"Charming little restaurant in the Venetian.  Loved the atmosphere.  Italian accents, delicious pasta, old-school Italian music, wonderful service, and decent prices.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza came out late and cold but it was still good just wish it would have been warm. The spinach side dish was great. We also ordered the swordfish silicon which was a little dry but good sauce and nice veggies. Service was slow but we met a nice couple next to us from Australia so it helped pass the time.  Overpriced for the food court location."}
{"text":"Amazing little place inside the Venetian. If you are coming make sure to come with 4 or less individuals as seating is extremely limited. Service is excellent but the food, mama Mia!!!! Wow! Phenomenal Italian food, perhaps the best Italian food in Vegas, the state of Nevada, and just maybe the US. Go for a quick lunch, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you want to go to a sidewalk cafe in Italy but don't want to fly.  This is the place.  I love their spaghetti and meatballs.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.  But last time my meatball was a little dry.  (too much bread crumbs or leaner meats maybe)  But the fresh baked rolls were great.  Olive oil served with the bread was very good.    Service was great.  The price was reasonable.  I am glad they expanded."}
{"text":"Good tasting food that I'll probably never taste again as I don't want to subject my family to that poor of service. I don't necessarily think that the place has bad service overall, for I witnessed our server take great care of the tables around us - offered fresh pepper, cheese, refills, dessert, etc. None were offered to us, we had to chase her down for refills and remind her the kids meal came with dessert. But what really puzzled me was the portion size of my entree. My linguine with clams entree was smaller than my 2 year old's spaghetti from the kids menu. Both served in the same bowl that's only slightly bigger than the small bread plate. We were excited to try their dessert but we never got that far. I normally base my reviews mostly on the taste of food and just explain my experience with service and ambiance, but the service was just THAT bad."}
{"text":"Good tasting food, but less than satisfactory service. I wouldn't say that the service is bad all around, I witnessed our server take great care of the tables around ours. Offered fresh pepper, cheese, refills, etc...just not to us. But what really puzzled me was the portion size of my mother's entree. Her $20 linguine with clams was smaller than my 2yo daughter's spaghetti from the kids menu, which was served in the exact same size bowl that is only slightly larger than a small bread plate (see pics). We had to wait 15min, after asking, to receive the check, another 10min for her to take payment, and had to remind our server that the kids meal came with dessert, which we ended up having to take home. The rest of us wanted dessert but we couldn't handle being there any longer (nearly 2hrs). There were only 5 seated tables in the entire restaurant at the time, so it was frustrating that we had to chase our server down so much. Needless to say, we're very disappointed. 4 stars for food (5 stars for garlic knots). 1 star for service."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5star! The food was perfect and out waiter was amazing. It is one of my new favorite restaurants when in Vegas. It is in the Grand Canal area."}
{"text":"We called in a pizza order and everything went well so far. Food was good. But after approaching the restaurant was when the bad service happened. Three workers were outside conversing with one another and did not acknowledge us. We spoke to who we assume as the host who told us to proceed to the bar for to go orders. The bartender was nowhere in sight. When she got back to the bar she did not notice me standing in front of the pizza box that was mine. She started grabbing glasses and assumed I wanted a drink but I told her I had a to go order. She roughly throws the bill on top of the pizza box to give to me and then immediately walks away to take an order of a table far away from the bar top. She spends longer than normal taking their order as I glared her down. I've had my credit card on hand since before she got to the bar so there was no wait in me giving her my card. She scans it and sets it down and proceeds to help other customers again! Needless to say, this to go order took as long as a dine in order. We could have finished our pizza in the time it took to wait for her to ring us up so we could leave. Terrible service at the bar. That woman deserves to be fired. Shorter brunette curly haired older woman. Rude and unapologetic. She is the sole reason we will never return even tho the food was decent and the phone call went normally."}
{"text":"I wouldn't consider this spot a hidden gem but it's pretty damn hard to find if you're looking for it. We stumbled upon this place just walking around the Grand Canal Shoppes and decided to give it a try based on seating availability. Who knew it had such good reviews on Yelp! It's located right before the food court and has a nice patio seating area.   The food came out pretty quickly. Before your entree comes, they give you complimentary garlic knots and they are to DIE for. It comes out super hot, soft and delicious!! Dip it in some balsamic vinegar and oil and I could eat it for days. It's definitely comparable to the garlic knots at C&O's in Los Angeles if you've ever been there. I was thinking of ordering the lasagna but our waiter said they were out of lasagna for the day. HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF LASAGNA AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT? Sure, it's one of your more popular items, so shouldn't you have a lot of ingredients for your popular dishes? To say the least, I was severely disappointed. I settled for the penne a la Vodka which is topped with diced prosciutto. The creamy pink sauce has a nice, delicate taste to it. I wish there was just more sauce though. The penne was cooked al dente and had a firm texture to it. I'd definitely recommend and you can't go wrong with a penne dish!   My heart was set on ordering the lasagna... maybe I'll get it next time if they don't run out... so disappointing."}
{"text":"Trattoria Reggiano is the kind of place you can easily walk past and not even realize it. We were supposed to go to a fancy restaurant but doing all that walking inside the Venetian with my heels was a killer and when I went to take a break I saw bunch of tables and seats out in the middle of the walk way... figured it was close enough, so we tried it. Best decision ever! It's a little weird because it's self seating but it's still an adorable venue. It's also a delightful place for people watching. The staff was super friendly and fast. I ordered the baked ziti... and let me tell you it was the best baked ziti I have ever tried! The pasta was cooked just right and the cheese wasn't too overpowering and the sauce mmmmm have no idea what made it so different but I'm not going to question a good meal. And the best part of the dinner was the bill! It's completely affordable place with amazing food, please try it! Def coming back here when I go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I went during the lunchtime hour with a co-worker. The food and service were great. The staff members were friendly and attentive. A good spot for a date night with the wife."}
{"text":"We chose this place in the Venetian mostly because the other restaurants were SO loud! My mother in law would have never been able to hear any of our conversation. What a great surprise, the food was great! Probably the best meal we had while we were in Vegas. They were accommodating to a menu substitution and friendly from beginning to end. It's not a destination place, the decor isn't going to wow you, but if you just want some great food then this is the place!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was so-so, but the food and the service were great.  Ordered pasta agoglio and they accommodated the request even though the item wasn't on the menu. Our server, Victor, was superb.  I asked for sauce (other than the marinara they provided) for the calamari and Victor made an awesome suggestion and charmed our table.  The best server ever and good food.  I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and it sort of tries to have a family-run vibe despite being on the Strip. I ordered the clam pasta and thought that it was a little bit underwhelming and lacking in flavor. Perhaps they could have amped up the herbs and the butter? I also thought that the garlic knots that they served at the beginning of the meal were too greasy! The paper was covered in oil...I've had garlic knots before, and i know that they're an indulgence, but this was a bit overly oily..."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as well as customer service. Fast and friendly! Chicken marsala was incredible!"}
{"text":"I never would have considered this place if it hadn't been for Yelp. Thanks Yelpers! ;)  Anyways, this place is tucked away at the end of the Canal Shoppes at the Venetian. No, it doesn't have a big, neon sign and dim lighting. But it does have FABULOUS food in HUGE portions for CHEAP in VEGAS.  FABULOUS. HUGE. CHEAP. VEGAS. YES!!!  I enjoyed the Penne in Vodka Sauce much more than I did the Linguine Carbonara, though that was really good as well. But by the time I was getting really full, the Carbonara was getting too rich and cheesy, so the Penne was a bit lighter and therefore tastier to me.  Service was friendly and the people there are very non-pretentious and warm. The bread at the beginning, although a bit on the greasy side, was great too! Nice place to eat a meal without killing your wallet in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I came to Trattoria Reggiano to give it a try after some friends recommended it to us. I would have to say that this place is great. You can tell they are still getting come grand opening details figured out but the food and service were excellent! I have to make sure to mention that Vito the manager went above and beyond to make sure our experience was pleasant. It's not easy going out with a 15 month old and I felt welcome here. I hope they keep it because I plan on returning. Oh and before I forget the meatballs were unreal!"}
{"text":"Perfectly prepared chicken for the chicken parmigiana. The ricotta is amazing! Our server, Rodolfo, got everything right"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing!   I ordered the clam and pasta. It was sooo good. The complimentary bread was also very delicious. The service that the waiters provided was so caring and sweet and definitely patient to provide excellent care for their customers.   Although this place was very small, it was indeed very nice."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch after checking out the Venetian canal and saw that this place had good Yelp reviews. I thought the food was good, but I would not go back. The restaurant is located in a food court so I did not like the atmosphere; there was no scenery and it cheapened the experience even though our pasta dishes were $20. The penne vodka and carbonara were both good, but definitely nothing to write home about. There are so many cooler restaurants on the strip such that I cannot recommend going here unless you happen to be walking by and are in need of Italian. Again, solid food, but was not memorable and the restaurant had a cheap ambiance."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with my husband and friend. Small place that was busy! Our table wasn't ready for our reservation and we had to wait 15 minutes, but that was forgotten quickly as the food was delicious. Paolo was a great server, engaging in conversation and making recommendations. We started with the mussels, which were delicious! Caesar salads came, I am not a fan typically but picked off their plates and enjoyed! Not overwhelming Caesar dressing. My friend said she would have preferred it stronger, but everyone has an opinion :) Hubby had lobster ravioli, my friend had linguine &a clams in red sauce and I had the special (rigatoni with mushrooms, sausage and red sauce). We all cleaned our plates! I can be pretty picky about red sauce, and this was fabulous! Just enough sweet to cut any acid from the tomatoes, but still a really delicious tomato sauce! Chocolate cake for dessert. All desserts are homemade daily.   Reminded us of a mom and pop hole in the wall place, which we love. Serving sizes were just right, enough that we could eat it all but not feel over full.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It was worthy of its 4-star rating. We used the half-price coupons from Tix4Tonight. It would have been overpriced food if not for the coupons. Complimentary garlic knots were pretty good. I had the parts carbonara. Very good. Husband had penne with vodka sauce. Good. Daughter had gnocchi with pesto. Good. Son had grilled salmon. Very good. Caesar salads very good. Decent service including a free birthday dessert."}
{"text":"The food here is the real deal. Absolutely delicious. The host helped us trade for a terrific waiter. (Our first one was a grump.) Ask for Victor. He will take care of you. Try the clam linguine and Italian kale salad."}
{"text":"Not sure what the high star ratings are for. Hard to find as it's basically in the food court. Food was quite good. Service was OK on the surface (to our face) but we overheard them talking badly about us when we were leaving because we were Australian and probably wouldn't leave a tip. We did leave a 22% tip. Wish we didn't.   Given how many restaurants there are in Vegas, there would be 500 better options than Trattoria Reggiano."}
{"text":"Go to Yelp or some of the other review sites and look this place up and you'll think, OK this place seems pretty good.  All I can say is that it is amazingly over rated.  We with started garlic knots . . . Bathed in butter.  Not what I call a good start.  We decided to make up for the bread with an appetizer of Calamari.  It came out over breaded and with a rubbery texture.  The sauces were tarter (can you say bottled), and marinara that was close to ketchup.  For the main course I had Salmon.  It was not well prepared and two carrots with mostly potatoes were what was supposed to be a vegetable side.  My son had veal piccata which again was bathed in a lemon butter.  Has no one learned that you can't cover bad food with butter and lemon?  His vegetable was the same as mine so nothing to rehash here.  I know we're in Las Vegas and meals are inherently expensive on the strip, but the quality and value of what we received was horrible.  It belongs in the fast food chain category, not Las Vegas.  The Venetian / Palazzo should be ashamed for having such a restaurant in their venue compared to the other wonderful establishments they have on site.  Run, don't walk past this restaurant to one of the other gems on site."}
{"text":"I am always apprehensive to go for Italian cuisine outside of the Northeast because let's be honest, we do it best here :) But my good friend and fellow Yelper Geri R recommended Trattoria Reggiano and there is no way that I would discount the recommendation of a fellow Italian (and an Italian Yelper, at that).   This place was legit. Everything from the filet mignon meatballs, to the cold antipasto platter, to the pasta, to the chicken, to the veal, to the seafood...it was all amazing. Like New York amazing. This was probably the best dinner we had during our 4 day stay. I only wish we had room for dessert. We were such fatties that there was no way we'd be able to eat something sweet and not need a nap. There was gambling to be done, after all!  Service was efficient and they made excellent recommendations when we were torn between a couple of items. They take pride in their food and it shows. You cannot go wrong here. The only negative is that it packs up quickly so you might have a little bit of a wait. But that's okay - put your name on the list and go shop for a bit. You'll be thrilled you did.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Due to our meager mini-meal at Japonais, we came to Trattoria Reggiano to fill our stomachs.  We were seated right away in the last open booth, which was perfect for the 4 of us.  It is very cozy on the inside, yellow walls with lots of framed black and white pictures.  There are also several tables outside.  The bread basket looked very promising but it definitely would have been better if warm.  You get a whole bottle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to mix at your own will.  We ordered the Pizza Margherita and the pasta with vodka cream sauce and proscuitto.  Both were very delicious!  The pizza was very hot and satisfying, and the pasta was flavorful."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  I know that the garlic knots are all the rage here but they didn't wow me. They were good but not something to rave about  On the other hand, the bolognese sauce was definitely praise worthy. A copious amount of delicious and tasty bits of meat coated in a wonderful rich tomato sauce. Pasta was done well and portion was good  Overall Thoughts  Would have no problem venturing back to Trattoria Reggiano to see what else they have to offer"}
{"text":"What a gem for great Italian food. The garlic knots were great to start with. We had the spaghetti and meatballs and pesto gnocchi which both were amazing. The staff are so nice and warm that you feel you are in Italy. The only thing is the capacity of this restaurant is small, so expect to dine in the middle of a busy walkway but its so worth the taste."}
{"text":"Auf der Suche nach einem netten Restaurant mit einigermaßen vernünftigen Preisen in Las Vegas bin ich durch Yelp auf diese kleine Perle aufmerksam geworden. Das Restaurant hebt sich mit seiner Größe, Intimität und authentischer Führung deutlich von den anderen Restaurants ab.   Ich hatte die \"Spaghetti mit Meatballs\", die vom Geschmack und auch vom Garzustand sehr, sehr gut waren. Für 18 Dollar und Vegas auch angemessen. Die kleine Weinauswahl ist vernünftig und preislich ebenfalls ok. Nicht zu empfehlen sind die frittierten Calamari, ich hatte einen gegrillen Calamar erwartet und nicht diese deep-fried Häppchen.   Durchaus kinderfreundlich vom Service allerdings kein Kids-Menu oder die sonst in den USA üblichen Stifte/Malbücher. Auf Wunsch wurden uns Nudeln mit Butter aber problemlos für die Kids gemacht, dann aber mit 14 Dollar doch saftig berechnet.  Insgesamt dennoch ein Tip für einen kleinen italienischen Abend im großen Venetian."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner here. Bethany was attentive and friendly! I had the bake ziti with meatballs (took half home just as amazing heated up the next day.) great atmosphere we will definitely be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Food bar and atmosphere is great!!!!!!! Lobster ravioli and the bartender was my favorite."}
{"text":"We are generally not big fans of casino restaurants. However after reading the yelp reviews decided to try this. And we are a big fan of this restaurant. Wonderful location great service The meatball appetizer is as good as advertised fabulous!  The arugula and cherry tomato salad with the lemon olive oil dressing is wonderful and bright in flavor.  The salad was easily large enough for us to split.   Prices are very reasonable.     The garlic knots  are also worthy as others have said.    Great flavors and fresh.  We finished with the gluten free bruschetta pizza which was equally wonderful.  Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"given the location of this place, I have passed it 10000 times since starting at The V.... I have heard from a number of people that it was good and man... they didnt lie... I had the calamari and chicken marsala.... everything was cooked perfectly and our server was very efficient.   I will definitely head back sometime soon!   Very impressed.  :)"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had. The staff was friendly and helpful. They recommended the special of gnocchi with bolognese and it was AMAZING!! We also shared a warm spinach salad which was different and tasty. The garlic bread was also a real treat. It's kinda hidden and away from the activity of the Venetian, but it was so worth it."}
{"text":"I thought this place was amazing.  We came to Vegas for a race, so we ate a lot of pasta the nights leading up to the race.  This was by far my favorite pasta we had while we were in Vegas.  The waitress was also very nice and accommodating of all my weird requests.  I am a vegetarian and so she pointed out all of the things that had a meat or cheese in it that I wouldn't expect.  It was very helpful and thoughtful."}
{"text":"Great service. Love the decor makes you feel at home. Ordered the filet mignon spaghetti and they were the best meat balls I ever tried they're very tender. I Also tried the sausage pizza and it was very cheesy and crispy."}
{"text":"Remember to buy \"Tix tonight\" for 1/2 price. But not all booths have this coupon, i went to \"fashion show mall\" to buy coupon. All the pasta here is good."}
{"text":"Don't let the small size and relative lack of crowds fool you - despite the fact that it's not on the main drag, this has the best Italian food on the strip.  We had pizza, pasta and salad and it was all delicious.  The pasta was cooked to perfection and the pizza had a nice thin crust.  We were also given garlic bread which was delicious, albeit very oil/buttery.  For the strip, the prices are reasonable.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who has a hankering for Italian food in between gambling and clubbing :)"}
{"text":"Poor Service and High Priced Average Food. Best thing is the small free cheese and olive plate. Bummer 4 people over $200+ we had 1 appetizer, 4 entries and 4 cocktails. Server could care less if we received what we ordered and provided zero assistance or recommendations. He missed several items and the only time we saw him was for the order and the check? Properly survives due to great location."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome. The food is great, the service is superb. I'd like to shout out to my server Lyndsay. She's very good and attentive and I'm really glad I went with her recommendations!! My cabonara was very authentic and tasty. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"A casual Italian restaurant with classic fare - chicken parmesan, spaghetti and meatballs, etc. We ordered a salad, meatballs, and the linguine with clams, and it was the perfect amount to share between two people. Yes, the rolls were good but we didn't over indulge because we wanted to have room for the delicious food. I loved the meatballs; they packed a lot of flavor! I could've honestly been fine with some balls and wine (personal preference). My husband is a huge fan of linguine with clams and theirs definitely measured up. Definitely worth checking out if you want something low key."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today and we had a great experience. The food was really good as was the service. The tiramisu was the best part! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food is good, but did not knock my socks off. Atmosphere is a little \"food court\" feeling as they are brightly lit and open into the Venetian food court."}
{"text":"I like this unpretentious restaurant's food much more than the dinner I had at Zeffirinos.  Why?  Because this food actually had FLAVOR!  We started with the Filet Mignon meatballs which were tasty and saucy.  As for the garlic rolls, I found those to be too doughy.  For dinner  my adult children had caesar salads, pizza and pesto gnocci, which they enjoyed.  I ordered the baked ziti which was delicious.  For dessert, we enjoyed the very dense chocolate layer cake, which the three of us were unable to finish.  This place made me wish we had a refrigerator waiting in our room so we could bring home our leftovers.  One of my favorite things about this place is the authenticity of the wait staff.  I enjoyed the energy in the place, including the yelling at each other in Italian, interacting with the patrons with personality and genuine interest, and the attention to the patrons' comfort.  You can tell this is a family owned restaurant and that they take pride in their establishment."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight for dinner. Both pizza and pasta were outstanding. Waiter brought some extra freebies while we were waiting for food to arrive. Placed was packed inside and out which was great for a Tuesday night. Will def return"}
{"text":"Great service! Great coffee! Great food!!! Love this place! It's so hard to find such a great Caesar salad and this place has an amazing one!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! I ordered a cesar salad because I was scared of what to order- YUM!! My Mother in law ordered a chicken and spaghetti dish that blew my mind!! I instantly regretted ordering the salad!   Downside- sodas are 3.50 a pop and no free refills-Iced tea is imported and 8 bucks. Few seats but super cute.  The wait staff was awesome!  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I had the eggplant parm and it was delicious. The bread was great and the casear salad was exceptional. The soup with meatballs was very good as well. The only downside was the lack of inside seating. We had to sit outside and it was pretty windy."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, excellent service. I had made a reservation and we were seated exactly upon arrival on a Friday night. Food was large portions, well prepared but I was most surprised by the attentive service. I've eaten at every restaurant in downtown Summerlin and this one just jumped to one of our favorites. Much better than Grape Street both in terms of food quality and definitely in terms of service. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  We loved this place so much we are going back for lunch today.  Fantastic food,incredible service and great atmosphere.  Every entree being brought out looked incredible.    Bread,calamari wine,salad, marinara sauce.   Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Judged us and seated guest after guest before us so we left and spent our money elsewhere. Yes real money you know thw thing that this restaurant lost and now has gained a 1 star. I shouldn't have to beg to have someone take my money."}
{"text":"The service alone makes this place a five-star restaurant. However, the food was spectacular as well! Fresh, flavorful, hot and served with style and a friendly smile. Highly recommend this small trattoria amidst the myriad of stores and other food options, don't miss it!"}
{"text":"The food was really tasty and service was great!! Teeny tiny place, but we got there early (11:30AM). There was no lunch menu, prices are a little steep for lunch, but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"The calamari with spicy marinara was great and so were the garlic knots. Pasta was just okay, a little bland. Paulo, our server/bartender, couldn't care less about his professionalism or even his job, for that matter. We had to ask for water twice and all he said was \"oh I didn't bring them huh\". We asked for the check and we waited 15 minutes because he forgot it...again. No apology.   The Venetian location is 10x better. I won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"I love Italian food, and this place was amazing! My sisters and I asked for a table of three and I liked how the man (I believe he was the manager or owner) was so outgoing and happy. In fact, throughout our meal, we noticed him interacting with the other guests, joking etc. The bread was nice and soft, and we had the Filet Mignon Meatballs as an app. I'm a picky eater, but holy crap, it was delicious. It had the perfect texture, taste and everything! I had the linguine bolognese and that was delicious as well. One of my sisters ordered the chicken parmigiana and she loved how tender the chicken was. We were stuffed, but we just had to try the chocolate cake. This was like a chocolate mousse cake and that's my favorite kind of dessert. So I absolutely loved it. One slice was plenty enough for the three of us. Safe to say we walked out completely stuffed. Our server was a tiny bit shy, but other than that, food is amazing, service is great, and we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Recently ate here this past weekend.. It's a little hard to find but it is a GEM once you find it in the canal!! Located in a small quaint spot underground the canal-- tried this place since we had resort credit for staying at the palazzo. There are many Italian spots in the Venetian and palazzo-- but I highly recommend this one if you crave Italian! From the fresh garlic bread-- you'll want more! My husband ordered the lemon chicken-- which the only thing was the portion-- I guess he expected more- although the taste was on point. I ordered the linguine bolognese-- mind you, not a fan of spaghetti, but this was delish! It had chunks of filet mignon meat , in which I thought was just ground beef. The portion was huge ! Had my husband finish half of my plate. I recommend you come here If you want to try !"}
{"text":"Very cute place. The meatballs and Garlic rolls are fantastic! Had the shrimp carbonara, wasn't real flavorful. Would pass on this the next time. My boyfriend had the shrimp scampi pasta and it was fabulous. He is a picky eater and he loved it! Will be coming back again real soon."}
{"text":"I would call it sort of a hidden gem. The place is hard to find inside Venetian....dwarfed by the bigger adjoining restaurants but we were glad that we kept our reservation. Both the food and the service was great."}
{"text":"Tough to find but worth it. It's located by the food court. Came here for early dinner about 6pm. People started lining up around 630pm. Everything we had was excellent: Caesar salad, linguine with clams, lobster ravioli, Veal picatta, and shrimp scampi. Typical vegas resort pricing but food was very good."}
{"text":"We had great pasta and wine at this restaurant last year.  I had to look it up again because we just wondered in and couldn't recall the name.  The waiter was very skilled and professional.  Great dining for a family of four, pricey, but such a relaxing and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"For on the strip dining Reggies  rocks. Very authentic style Italian food in a low key semi \"out door\" environment. It's a small place, feels like you were tucked in a side street in Rome, not like the expansive Maggianos down the street. Its in the back of the blue sky area. Very reasonable prices and wine list too. Our server, Sergio, was the real deal,  from Italy, who knew the food and wine inside and out. We had meatballs, cabrese and the calamari for apps ..perfect way to start off. Meatballs were outstanding, as was the cabrese.  Their pasta dishes were on the mark, pasta primavera... very light and fresh. The pizza was cooked perfectly, the dough a bit thicker that typical romano style but quite tasty the Quattro Stagioni was great. They have many good choices of pizza and pasta. We stuck to the pasta /pizzas mostly. Chicken parm was good as well. I'd definitely recommend this on the strip."}
{"text":"I love this place. Plain and simple. The food is fantastic, the service perfect, and the atmosphere welcoming. The party I went with all got different entrees from the menu and we shared them. Everything was good, and we couldn't agree which entree was the best. I loved the pasta a la vodka, my wife loved the linguini Bolognese, and my brother loved the tortellini alfredo. Bottom line it was all great. Be careful though, I highly recommend saving room for dessert. The cheesecake is one of the best I've ever had, and the tiramisu was delicious. On top of all of this or server made great recommendations, was extremely friendly, and made us excited to return again. The manager introduced herself to us and chatted with us for a minute. It was a wonderful dining experience and I can't wait to come back and try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with meatballs.  I want to say I have tried about 30 different meatballs in my life.  Some may say, \"HA!  That is not many meatballs at all!!\"... but you know what?  It's a lot to me!  So yea, I love meatballs so I really wanted to try the Filet Mignon meatballs here.  Yes, they were delicious.  I'm a huge fan of meatballs that taste good without to much seasoning.  And that's exactly the case here, you can taste the meat.  But you know what?  I wonder if it would taste the same if they used regular beef as opposed to Filet Mignon.  My gosh their bread is amazing with the garlic and butter on them.  But it's almost like a heart attack.  Anyway, we got the arugular salad, a pizza with prosciutto, and eggplant parm.  Right now, it's my favorite Italian place in Vegas.  Wish it wasn't in the middle of the shopping plaza at Venetian, seems almost out of place!!    Service great, waiter very VERY nice.  Def will come back here."}
{"text":"Preface: this Italian restaurant is not 2 dollar signs -- more like three or four. And at that , this is way too pricey. 24$ for linguine balagnese ? Geez, even more expensive than Beverly Hills or Santa Monica in Los Angeles.  The garlic rolls come complimentary , which alleviates some of the cost, but I'd rather go off the strip for Italian food that is of equal quality and cheaper."}
{"text":"Table for 3  The pro: -Service   The con: -Lobster Ravioli  *Lackluster on the sauce when it came to flavor and depth.  *Pasta was still doughy  -Gnocchi al Pesto *Lackluster on the flavor of the sauce as well, however beautiful color and consistency that is pesto.  -Seafood Linguini *Oddly there was a pool of sauce or pasta water, I don't recall, but wasn't at all pleasing to see.   Not the best or worst Italian food, it was just okay. The food lacked a lot of the hearty flavor profiles that is Italian."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Best restaurant in the Venetian. Found this restaurant on Yelp and couldn't have been happier.  It's hard to find within the canals of the Venetian.  In fact, we could barely even find it on the property map, it's that small and several employees we asked didn't know where it was located.  I had the Veal Parmigiana which may have been the best veal I have ever tasted.  The serving was huge and the veal was nicely breaded with a crispy crunch.  The sauce was an unusual orange color, but extremely tasty as well.  The bread, to die for...  I travel quite a lot to Vegas for work and have eaten at many of the famous chef restaurants including Batalli, Flay and LaGasse.   This was far better than any of those restaurants and I look forward to my next visit.  Note:  if you are having trouble finding the restaurant, it's right next to Harry Houdini Magic Shop..."}
{"text":"New to Vegas, so I'm still exploring all the good spots to eat. Seeing I love italian food, I had to try it here. They didn't have my favorite dish which is chicken piccata but they did have my second which is shrimp scampi so that is the only reason they got 4 stars and not 5 stars.   I started my meal out with their steamed mussels, hot cheesy rolls and with oil and balsamic vinegar on the side. Then ordered their shrimp scampi, the shrimps were larger and cooked to perfection. The pasta tasted awesome with the lemon butter sauce.   They also have a bar where you can come just get a drink and watch a game or something.   The service was on point and they made sure you had everything you need, not pushy at all. Sonic your ever in Vegas and want some Italian food, I recommend you come here."}
{"text":"I seriously love this cute Italian restaurant. Located inside the Venetian near the food court. It is closer to the back, a few shops from near the entrance of the parking garage. (You'll understand when you go there.) We went in and was seated in a booth. The inside was very small, but the booth made it feel spacious. The yellow walls and rustic photos made it feel very cozy and charming. The music was very nice too. It felt like I was in Italy, but not quite. But it made the ambiance a lot warmer.  Our server was very nice and was quite speedy. He had our waters out to us and our bread to us quite fast, but it was okay with me because I was thirsty. I read some of the other yelp reviews, and decided that I wanted to get the calamari. Calamari is probably one of my favorite appetizers. It was a huge portion. The calamari was so crispy and it was just delicious. It wasn't too salty and it had a tomato based dipping sauce which complimented the calamari perfectly. The added lemon juice made it extra delicious for me. This calamari dish was one of the best I've had. My boyfriend and I devoured that, hehe. The bread was wonderful too.   For our main dishes he had the chicken parmigiana with the spaghetti. It was a good sized portion, if I would've known better I would have just shared with him! You could really taste the tomatoes in the sauce. I had a lemon dish with chicken, I forget the name. Sorry! I won't lie though it was a little too lemony for me, and I am a big lemon fan. So rethink that dish if you don't want to be overwhelmed by lemon.   But I do love this Italian restaurant. Would definitely be back in again when I'm at the Venetian!"}
{"text":"Great meatballs... A must try. I loved how the waiter split an dish for us with no extra charge. The garlic rolls were buttery and warm, with excellent oil and vinegar."}
{"text":"Weirdly tiny restaurant in the middle of a shopping mall... erm, I mean the Venetian. Though it really does feel like you're eating in a restaurant inside a mall.  ...but it's good! The garlic rolls were quite awesome and the caesar salad and meatball appetizers were also satisfying and tasty. My swordfish was pretty good, though the veggies on the side were boring and meh. Like everything on the strip, it wasn't exactly a great value, but overall it was pretty good. This place wouldn't survive in San Francisco or NYC... but then again, not much in Vegas would."}
{"text":"It was an okay meal. The tortellini with alfredo was a very small serving for the price. Sauce was bit bland and very thin. The pasta itself was tender and very good. My husband had the baked ziti with meat balls and enjoyed it. Calamari was good. The spicy marinara was delicious.   We both agree we will not go back but it was okay for a last minute lunch. $77 before tip for two people. No salad with the meal.  We are Italian, rarely go out for Italian food as it is hard to  find authentic/really good food around here. Can honestly say this is no better than Olive Garden. Olive garden is less expensive and the food is the same quality"}
{"text":"We were looking for an Italian restaurant to eat dinner before the Human Nature show in the Venetian Hotel and reading the reviews and having two people I knew who ate here before, sealed the deal and I made reservations for 5:15 pm.  The place is alittle hard to find, but it is located near the food court.    Our server was friendly and attentive and when we first got there, it wasn't busy but by the time we finished dinner, the place was packed!  Luckily, dude found a Tix 4 Tonight booth that had 50% off entrees and pastas at Trattoria Reggiano.  These tickets cost $3 a person and can only be used Monday to Thursday from 11 am to 10 pm.  Menu prices are high for a hotel restaurant.  We started with the delicious garlic knots, then shared a kale peanut salad (crunchy and tasty), veal milanese (light and crispy light batter with arugula sprinkled on top) and lobster ravioli!  I liked the veal milanese more than the lobster ravioli although they were both pretty good.  And I think because I told the server that we had a 7 pm show, the food came out pretty quickly!    Had a very enjoyable dinner!"}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places to dine ! Delicious Authentic Italian Cuisine,  attentive service and a beautiful atmosphere. My Favorite Mother's Day Dinner choice.  Five Stars"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Being local I've tried many others on and off The Strip yet Trattoria Reggiano is still the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas! Ask for Amanda and she can tell you the best wine to go with anything and maybe even suggest something tasty off-menu."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and I was pleasantly surprised! Probably one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to. Everything went right during my visit, and I definitely want to return on my next trip to Vegas!  Pros - The FOOD! I ordered the Linguine Bolognese and it was perfection. Also, the food came out piping hot which I definitely appreciated. I and everyone else in my party loved our entrees  - The garlic bread was to DIE for. I'm a huge garlic fan so their bread was freaking amazing! - Service was great! Our server was attentive without being too pushy or annoying.  Cons - As other Yelp users mentioned,  this restaurant is in more of a food-court type of setting in the Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian Hotel. We had to walk quite a bit from where we entered to find this restaurant, but it wasn't a big deal at all."}
{"text":"Maybe I didn't order the right thing. Maybe they were having an off-day. Or maybe...I was just excited to catch up with my friend I just picked the first thing I saw on the menu.  I came here on a Saturday evening. Surprisingly....parking was easy to find. I saw plenty of parking spaces in the lots AND in the garage.   I ordered the Linguine Bolognese-ground beef with some kind of tomato sauce, fresh herbs and spices, tossed with light Parmesan. It SOUNDS delicious but really, it was a let down. Wasn't very flavorful and tasted bland. Too much pasta but not even meat sauce. Also....this restaurant is pretty pricy for what it's really worth. $22 freakin dollars for my entrée. If you want to add chicken, shrimp etc....it's like $6 extra. For this kind of price...I could have gotten a much better quality dinner at Bootlegger Bistro!! Ugh.... =/"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp when a friend was craving Italian and we wanted to have a nice dinner on our last night in Vegas. This is a great small establishment. I had the lobster ravioli, which was delicious. The garlic knots which came with the meals were really good. The others in my party also enjoyed their meals which included the tortellini and veal parm. The prices were fair and the portion sizes just right. The staff were all friendly, happy, and pleasant. They also joked with us a little which was fun. Our party of 5 had a short wait for a table since the place is very small. It was worth it, but you may want to make a reservation during busy times if they take them."}
{"text":"Great place. It looks very touristic but it's actually really good. When we first ate there we were skeptical how good it would be. But it's almost authentic Italian. Very friendly service. Pizza is great. Pesto Gnocchi great as well. Ate there three times now and it's been great."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find this small place. I had the vegetarian pizza, it was a great choice. I definitely recommend if you want to eat not too pricey Italian food."}
{"text":"Paolo was our server and he was nothing short from amazing. Great service and even better food! A must dine for the entire family! First time here but returning every visit to Vegas for sure! Amazing job to all thank you again."}
{"text":"Trattoria Reggiano is one of my all time favorite restaurants in Vegas.  I always get an appetizer of the meatballs which are absolutely amazing and I order the veal parmigiana.  Everything is superb.  I've brought multiple teams here during conferences and each person walks away extremely satisfied and excited to come back the following year.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First, this place is really hard to find.  Its tucked away far in the back of the shopping area.  I suggest looking for Brighton or the Coffee Bean and you \"should\" be able to find it.  Was all excited to eat here after reading other reviews but it fell short of my expectations.  I ordered the chicken parm and it came with a small side of spaghetti.  The spaghetti was delicious.  The chicken had a reheated chicken taste to it and I did not enjoy at all.  My hubby had pasta puttenesca.  He ate it all.  Was enjoyable but not fantastic.  Two glasses of wine, our two entree's and and iced tea was $65. Maybe I didn't order the right thing but wont be returning... sorry.  The service was pretty good.  Everyone was extremely friendly but the food just didn't do anything for me.  Plus, I just hate that reheated chicken taste."}
{"text":"This is not worth trip. Sauce tasted canned. Nothing special about the lasagna or fetucinne Bolognese. Wont be back. Better places around"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner. Our waiter was awesome. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waiter quickly as well. I had made a reservation however it probably was not necessary. This was my second time visiting this restaurant. The first time was 5 years ago and I was very pleased that the food still tasted as wonderful as I remember it. I had the fettuccine alfredo and it was wonderful. Not too overly buttery and the perfect size portion. My husband had the chicken parm and raved about it as well. The bread they give is delicious and cheesy. Highly recommend this restaurant. It is tricky to find since the grand canal shoppes have a lot of twists and turns so definitely allow yourself enough time to find it if you're not familiar with area."}
{"text":"Debated between 2 or 3 stars.  Thought this place would be good based off the reviews.  Maybe we got here too late (around 9pm) but that's really not late for Vegas.  Anyways, I settled for good ol' spaghetti and meatballs.  Not a fan of the marinara sauce at all, way too salty for me.  But loved the meatballs.  So I gave them 3 stars since service was decent.  Also, the garlic knots were yummy!"}
{"text":"First timers, No complaints here. Food was excellent, service was outstanding, especially bartenders  Eli and Bethany. Spicy calamari, lobster ravioli, and baked ziti with filet mignon and pork loin meatballs were fantastic. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The veal Parmesan was excellent.  A generous thick portion of veal, covered w/ a flavorful sauce and cheese.  The pasta and bread complimented the veal perfectly.  We were truly impressed with the outstanding customer service.  No wonder the place was packed.  But we didn't feel rushed.  One of the best Italian meals we have had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has the best pasta in Summerlin! Ask for Ricki to be your waitress, she'll give you top notch service!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Get the meatballs.  They are the best I have ever had.  Pasta was perfectly cooked.  Clam sauce was light with excellent flavor.  Canoli was amazing.  Only reason it doesn't get five stars is the ambiance is lacking."}
{"text":"The food was great, and the atmosphere is lovely. Most restaurants of this caliber neglect the vegetables not this place they were cooked perfectly. Unfortunately I couldn't give it five stars cause the restaurant is located across from Dave & busters ."}
{"text":"Had spaghetti and meatballs which was way too salty, I understand Parmajano Reggiano adds salt flavor but the salt I taste came from Spaghetti sauce. Prachstto Pizza was unremarkable, arugula Caesar salad the dressing lacks flavor. Barely had any food and lied to waitress I already ate when she asks you hardly touched your food. Best part about the meal is 3 glass of coke I had, and the server was attentive."}
{"text":"Location: Venetian hotel  Hi there! I only have two photos of two different pasta plates due to my other friends devouring it before i got a chance to capture an image of the pasta. Many things i want to say about the 5 different pasta dishes. I am a pasta man.  5 types of pasta dishes we had:  - Chicken Parmesan  Breaded chicken breast in our traditional San Marzano pomodoro sauce and melted mozzarella, served with spaghetti  - Chicken Francese Fresh chicken breast sautéed in lemon-white wine sauce and a touch of butter, served with spaghetti  - Linguine Bolognese Slow simmered ground filet mignon in San Marzano pomodoro sauce, fresh herbs, spices, and Parmigiano Reggiano  - Spaghetti Carbonara Spaghetti pasta, imported pancetta, egg yolks, and Parmigiano Reggiano are combined to create this classic Italian specialty  - Spaghetti & Meatballs Housemade filet mignon and pork loin meatballs with our classic San Marzano pomodoro sauce, olive oil and spices  All descriptions are from the real menu itself.    1. Texture of pasta and meat itself: Pasta was cooked nicely. Softer than Al dente. I'm sure the chef would be able to boiled the pasta to give it a chewier texture if asked. So if you enjoy soft pasta, but not too soft, then you'd like their pasta.  Chicken wasn't dry and had a very nice texture! Any beef plates, such as ground filet mignon sauce in bolognese, and meat sauce in spaghetti had plenty of flavor!  The Carbonara is your typical pancetta, egg, and parmesan mixture. Initially, the plate is bland itself because of how easily the pancetta can make it salty and I felt like an addition of salt was needed but overall, it was a good dish.  Only reason why i didn't give the place a 5 star was because of the amount of lemon was added to the chicken francese. Though reading the menu, i knew the dish was going to be a semi-sour dish, but lemon-wine was also added to the spaghetti making the dish dominantly sour. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was cooked perfectly, i preferred this chicken itself have the taste and maybe the spaghetti should become less sour and more sweet. Maybe add a sauce that would dress the spaghetti and not drench it? My personal opinion of course. I personally had the linguine bolognese, and although i very much enjoyed the dish, i felt like it was drenched in oil. The oils that came from the grounded filet sauce. Near the end i had to take the meat out from its original plate to finish it off because it was very oily.  Overall, i would definitely recommend and would go out of my way to eat here. But not often because it's fairly pricy   Rating 4.2/5  My third picture is the cost of all the plates. You can assume that the pasta dishes are around ~20$ Trattoria also serves other entrees that vary around 25-35$   Tips: GREAT TASTING GARLIC KNOTS AS FREE STARTERS! (Only first order is free) Plates look small in picture, but are big in person. Don't let it deceive you! We order an extra pizza and didn't even get to it!  Bone Apple tea"}
{"text":"Best spot for Italian! Service is great, food is amazing and a crowd pleaser (we've told a lot of friends about our find). Located in the Venetian shops, it's definitely worth it to get there a little earlier than you want to eat because there is sometimes a line, but they're expanding which I think will be great for service. Amazing garlic rolls with fresh Parmesan, garlic and butter! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is very hard to find but it's totally worth the hunt!   It's strange that this restaurant isn't listed under the Venetian directory but thankfully a nice security guard directed us to the restaurant.  Because it's tucked away you won't be dining next to the tourist craziness next to the gondolas which i think is a big positive too.   As for the food, first off they have one of the best pre-meal breads I've tasted.  Nice and garlic-ey and Parmesan-ey.  It's so good.  If you're with a eating companion I recommend that you share a large size salad.  It's a perfect size to share.  We had the Caesar salad which was excellent.  The entrees were also really great and reasonably priced.  We had the baked ziti and the baked salmon both made to perfection.  Now I know where to go when I'm craving some great Italian food on the strip!"}
{"text":"Food was spectacular. The set up was ok. You eat in what feels like a hallway connecting two other places.... But it didn't matter as the chicken Parm was amazing and the meatballs just right."}
{"text":"New favorite place at DT Summerlin request Paolo he treated us like we were the most important people in the room and he's Italian from Milano. Gives the place a REAL vibe.  Felt like we were sitting in Italy.   Great place to go right before seeing a movie, it's literally right next door to Regal DT Summerlin.   They have a Happy hour too which is nice and the outdoor seating is really comfortable a real plus is you can hear yourself talk. Unlike some of the other restaurants in DT it's a great place to connect and meet with friends, we loved it! Service by Paolo was superb, I know I said it again but it's worth repeating. Great calamari, Chicken Parm is one of the dishes they're known for. We had such fun and loved it. See Vito the manager and ask for Paolo you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"The ribeye meatballs are da bomb!!!!  The pizzas are nice size & the service is fast.   On the pricy side but overall bomb ZA......  \"Thunderlips\""}
{"text":"This is a small place - about 6 tables inside and a dozen outside. Even though its located in the Venetian - it is independently owned. They serve up some of the best Italian food in Las Vegas - the pictures posted by Yelpers will attest to that.  I had the veal parmigiana, breaded pieces of veal melded with sauce and cheese with some pasta on the side. I would think this is a heavy dish but I found the veal to be light and perfectly battered. I posted a picture of this dish and am embarrassed to say I finished it all. Yup, every morsel. Paired with some great wine, this made for a memorable meal.  I was well taken care of by my server John and will definitely be here next time I am in Vegas to try the filet mignon meatballs."}
{"text":"Looked like a decent place for a meal, reasonable priced. But when we ordered we asked for a substitution on a pizza. Obviously was a crime since we were scolded by an older Italian man (only because he informed us he was Italian and they don't have sorporsetta only salami) I said weird as it says you have it on the menu (proceeded to point out to him) we were repaid by being served scorching hot pizza - enough to cause a 2nd degree burn."}
{"text":"A lot of Italian options in Las Vegas.  Most don't take over an hour to get the main course to the table.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went here with my co worker before we went to a concert on New Year's day.  The hostess was a little rude when I said I had no RSVP and seated us in the patio in the freezing cold.  Luckily they had heaters.  The food was good.  I had the Scampi and my co worker had the Frutta de mare.  I'll be back to try the desserts with my husband.  It was pricey but I think it was good overall."}
{"text":"It took almost an hour to find this place and go through hordes of people at the Venetian after deciding not to wait 2 hrs for the buffet at the Wynn. Huge mistake, the buffet would've been a much better dining experience with much tastier food and more variety, for about the same price. Yelp definitely steered me wrong in this case. No idea why they would rate this 4 stars on average?! Mediocre at best and I can make much better pasta at home. The complimentary garlic knots were not soft and pliable like a doughy rollout rather hard and dry. I only ate half of one. I ordered the seafood pasta and the hub got the meatballs. Both were just ok. Waitress was ok as well. Nothing spectacular about this dining experience, and wouldn't come again. Definitely not worth $80 for 2 entrees and a glass of red plus tip."}
{"text":"Yelp you failed us on this one. There is no way this place is not using a microwave. We had the chicken parm and shrimp linguini. The chicken was absolutely disgusting almost in edible. The shrimp fared a bit better but still not up to par. Do yourself a favor for 5.00 more a plate go to lavo you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good... the 4 cheese pizza was okay.. would have been better with sauce. Cheese and bread .... got a side of marinara to dip it The kids were very pleased, could have split the pizzas between 2 people"}
{"text":"Based on yelp-reviews, I decided to give his place a try. I got there but no tables were avaliable. A server asked me to come back in 10 minutes, so I did, and a table was ready for me.   This is a very small, hole in the wall type restaurant with great service and great food. I had the carbonara, and it was top notch. At 19 bucks, it's not the cheapest pasta I have ever ordered, but well worth the price."}
{"text":"Service has considerably improved.  Food is really good. Like the atmosphere.  Happy to see things have changed."}
{"text":"So, I'm not Italian but lived in Rome, Italy from the end of second grade through High School and have returned to visit many times. It is one place I call home. Coming to Tratorria Regiano reminded me a bit of what I come to expect when revisiting Italy. Good food and excellent service are both on display here. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and specials, which was very nice indeed, but I was more focused on the native Italian busboy who cleared the table and supplied the Reggiano to my party's salads and pasts dished. The man couldn't have been much younger than 70 years old and he was totally committed to making sure our table was always well-attended to. I forgot the man's name but I want him to know that I give the restaurant the extra star for his exceptional service. I had the ravioli and it was made al dente just as it would have been made back home, in Roma. The salad was huge and my friend's plates were delectable looking as well. Buona fortuna, Tratorria Reggiano e ci vediamo subito!"}
{"text":"Very festiv atmosphere for Christmas shopping, and great Red wine sangria to take the edge off!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots are massive and so delicious! The pizza was pretty good, I got the Salame Piccante - Pepperoni but I've never seen garlic knots so big in my life and I'm kind of in love with them now."}
{"text":"Went there with my mom she really picky with Italian food ! Everything taste amazing !!  Mimmo was our server he treat us with worm hospitality and make us feel like In a real authentic restaurant . Good atmosphere great vibe we defiantly coming back again."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant three stars. Although the drinks and the food came out in a timely manner our waitress did not check on us. Our busboy; however, did a great job. He checked on us more than the waitress. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Good for the price!  Pretty true italian."}
{"text":"Very happy with our experience here. Unlike the \"other\" Italian restaurant around the corner, the host staff seated us quickly and at the table we requested. We ordered our meal and were rewarded with some excellent buttery garlic rolls while we waited. The wife's spaghetti with meatballs was pretty good. I rarely order salads, but the Italian Kale salad with grilled chicken, white beans, boiled egg, bacon, and Gorgonzola dressing sounded good, and tasted even better. Our waiter Brandon was on top of his game, and his service easily warrants the fifth star on this review."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.  I ordered the linguine bolognes.  This dish was a great balance of flavors that were light and full of freshness.  The linguine was perfectly al dente, the quality of beef was on point and the portions were perfect.   There are a few things that I feel could be worked on just a bit and they are all service oriented.  First, I thought it was a nice gesture that they wanted to place your napkin on your lap for you, but, the first napkin was dropped on the ground and we were told they would get us another and well....she never came back.  Needless to say one lap was napkin less and the other didnt even get the attempt the first did.  Second, our server really looked like he hated his job.  I get it...you work at a trattoria in a mall in vegas.  I can see where you get the feeling of despair, but please, PLEASE put a smile on your face.  Aside from these two small things everything else was great and I would come back and dine here again.  After all, we aren't always on point and we do all have a bad day here and there."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while staying at the Venetian. Super easy to grab a reservation ahead of time via OpenTable. Our waiter was great - friendly and attentive. Food was good too. No kids menu, but our kids liked the pepperoni pizza they shared. I wolfed down my linguine with clams (they give lots of clams), and my wife really liked her chicken salad. The free garlic knots were good too."}
{"text":"A small restaurant with 20 tables so expect a wait. It felt like a small tratorria in Italy. The food and wine were well priced and very good. The meatballs were flavorful and the sauce well balanced."}
{"text":"Just skip the food court!  Don't walk by like we did several times while attending a convention at the Venetian. For a value price, enjoy a delicious pizza to share!  My husband and I only a 30 minutes to eat before an appointment.  The staff was able to accommodate our time crunch and our pizza was out in 10 minutes!  Besides the food being yummy, our waiter, Eric, was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Tasty Italian cuisine in a bit of a cheesy spot. Our server, who was actually Italian took the time to describe the difference between carbonara from northern Italy (with cream) and that from Rome (egg, but no cream). The pancetta added an extra layer of crispy texture to the dish. A bit on the expensive side for what you get, but that's to be expected at any Strip eatery. Nonetheless, We would definitely return if we're ever back at the Venetian."}
{"text":"I am so glad we found this restaurant. We took the outdoor seating area and ordered Eggplant Rollatini for appetizers and Tortellini Alfredo for a main course. Complimentary garlic bread was simply beyond words, real good!  Both the appetizer and the main dish were delicious. Service was great. To sum it, it was a wonderful dining experience with mouth watering Italian food!"}
{"text":"1 word for this place, EXCELLANT!! Service and food were both very good. The owner makes you feel like you're part of the family. The bread to start was out of this world. I got the Eggplant Parmesan and my boyfriend got the Cheese Ravioli w a side of meatballs, everything was so good and the price was very reasonable. The place is small but don't let the size fool you. I will definitely visit this place again the next time in Vegas. Thanks for a great meal!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Gave the place a try. Wanted a new change of pace to Vegas. We ordered the stuffed baked clams app. Was a daily special at the time they clams where so small and filled with breading there was not any clam at all. We then ordered pasta both our pasta dishes were undercooked. We took one bite of each and could not finish it. Then the waiter came and when we told him they were undercooked he almost laughed and it knew it was going to be. We then asked for the bill. We ended up paying 24 bucks for 8 tiny tiny clams and 2 pops. Never eat here. if you can't cook pasta don't call your self an Italian place. Wouldn't even go back for the bread total rip and I warn you stay away."}
{"text":"Good food. Family friendly. Good service. Only reason not a 5 star is because we were seated close to the walkway."}
{"text":"This little piece of Italian heaven reminds me of Superman. When you walk up the restaurant looks like any other jack in the box Italian restaurant. Then the food shows up and Clark Kent transforms into Superman. I had the Lasagna for dinner and if there had been enough room in the restaurant I would have done cartwheels. It was the second best Lasagna I have ever had which is saying a lot since I love lasagna. Then to top it off the cannoli was unbelievable. The others in my group all raved about the quality of the food along with the incredible flavors. This is great spot if you love Italian, oh did I mention they have real Italian waiters which adds to the enjoyment."}
{"text":"Really good Italian food.  The bread knots with garlic were yummy.  My husband had the spaghetti bolognese and I had a seafood pasta dish.  Both were very good."}
{"text":"Right now a big thumbs down. Our 20 minute wait has turned into 70 minutes.  Dear hostess learn how to judge time there are right now a good 20 angry people outside and pissed"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is so spectacularly fantastic! We had a wonderful waiter, Paulo (I believe). He was friendly and attentive. Did I mention how wonderful the food is? It really is and its fairly reasonably priced for the high quality of food received. Our table ordered lasagna, chicken marsala and quattro formaiga pizza. We didn't have a single complaint. In fact, it was funny how many sound effects we were all making (yum, oooo, ahhh). I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The wait was a little bit long. So we sat at the bar for a couple drinks. It was all just okay. After we finally got seated we decided to have the Meatballs! They were delicious, probably the best part of the experience. My boyfriend got the truffle Alfredo and it was 44$. I had a bite and it definitely was not worth the 44$. I would not come back here for anything in particular. The experience was just okay."}
{"text":"I really wish they would get some servers who had a sense of urgency. The last time we went i swore it off, but its right next to the movies. The food is really good. Ill either get a pizza or the veal chop parm on the bone. All the food is good but they have zero attention to detail and they are so slooooooooooooow. Last time was the worst. This time things started off well, appetizer came out quickly, food came fast too. Then it's just crickets. Sit sit sit sit.. I decided to walk around to find our waiter. No where to be found. I ask the hostess if she can locate him. She came back and said the guy is in the bathroom. I get it, guy has to go, but use ur head and ask someone to look after your tables if u r gonna be 20 mins. Finally, we got the check, i left 10 bux on 70 and a note telling them how slow they are. Im not going back anymore. It good food but not worth guarantees awful service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here this past sunday we had a 530 reservation, it was not packed at all, The service was great, the food was great and our server Hilda was really nice.   Oh and real cannolis just like NY  yay   we will def be back"}
{"text":"Portions were pretty good and their bread was amazing. The food was decent, but I kind of expected better from a restaurant at vegas.   My friends and I (party of 7) went and we ordered 5 items, the waiter was not pleased that we didn't each order a dish and gave us really nasty attitude as soon as he realized our appetite wasn't up to his expectations."}
{"text":"Stuff to try: Calamari and Lasagna. The garlic bread was great too! I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service all around.  Everything tastes high quality and the portions are large.  Every time we go the food is equally delicious and the servers are attentive.  Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"I went here because of the rating.  The place is not worth it.  The food was terrible, and it's very expensive for what they give you.  The waitress was the only good thing here."}
{"text":"Not that good. The service was great! The food was just okay. Really expensive for what you got. Had the mussels and they were fishy and still had some sand in them. The meatballs were a weird consistency. Just not that good. I will not be going back.  l"}
{"text":"Great little Italian food restaurant!  I got the lobster ravioli and it was fantastic. The ravioli was huge.  Their pizza and garlic bread rolls were also very good, though the rolls were a little cold.  The service was fine, though the host was not as friendly as he could have been. He was a bit condescending when I didn't know how to pronounce the name of a pizza, and was quite unresponsive.  Our other server was great, though."}
{"text":"Beyond amazing! Eat here like ASAP everything you want in an Italian restaurant and perfect service too! Victor was our waiter and he was more than informative with amazing recommendations! We picked everything he suggested and it was perfect. It's awkward to find yelp's location in the corner of the property is wrong. You will have a small adventure through the Canal Shoppes to get to it, but persevere it is 100% worth it and follow he posted maps in the Venetian ;) portions are HUGE keep that in mind and share if necessary. Salad in a small will literally feed 3 if that helps for a reference. All the pasta dishes you could feed 2 on. Again, great service fast and never left our glasses empty! All around epic!"}
{"text":"Let me begin with this: I spent 4 months studying abroad in Florence, Italy. I am extremely picky when it comes to eating at Italian restaurants, and I am highly critical when reviewing said restaurants.   Upon arriving, we were promptly seated and pleasantly greeted by our server. The service reminded me of what they offered back in Italia with the tables being out within the walkway of the Venetian itself. The tables were already set up with flowers,placemats, and silverware ready to go. I must say the environment and ambiance seemed to quite right to me.   After being seated, we were brought garlic bread that tasted pretty awesome. I ordered the chicken parmesan while my boyfriend went for the slightly more fattening veal parmasean. We opted out of ordering alcohol- they had a fairly extensive list that consisted of both domestic and imported choices- so that we could allocate our funds to dessert instead.   Our food came and was absolutely delicious. It wasn't dry but both our meats were tender and juicy. We had pasta and pasta sauce on the side, both of which did not overpower the veal and chicken. The sauce atop our meats too wasn't too much- just the perfect amount, along with the cheesy mozzarella slice.  We had to box the remainder of our meals, and order our cannoli to go, because we were stuffed to the brim. It's a good option though so you can return to your room, let your food settle, and enjoy a nice, romantic dessert later.  I would recommend this place if you are in the area. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it is well worth it. Great meals in Italy are not cheap; the same rule applies for the states. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, we ate outside even though it was chilly. They kept the outside patio very warm for us and there was a live singer outside while we ate. This made the experience better and relaxing as well. The server was kind and efficient with our entrees. The dinner overall was pleasant."}
{"text":"I eat at many Trattoria's and Italian Restaurants so I was thinking \"same old\" as I perused the menu.  I ordered the Bone In Veal Parm as I had never seen Bone In - Wow.  Succulent, tender, and yummy bites by the bone with great cheese and sauce.  I was very pleased.  Their free bread is dough round like a sticky bun except loaded with cheese on top and a butter sauce poured over it - decadent.  My friend had the Clam linguine which was excellent - Little necks loaded with flavor and clams."}
{"text":"Been here before and had a good experience with one of the friendly bartenders. I guess that was our only lucky day here. Things went downhill fast this visit. This time was completely awful. It ruined my daughters birthday dinner! Very disappointed in how they OVER CHARGE for dietary restrictions or substitutions. Since when does it make sense to sub out prosciutto for broccoli florets for $5 charge? Well it was $5, and There were maybe 6 broccoli florets in the entire dish. Felt like I was being nickled and dimed. Had I known that they were importing the broccoli from Mars or blessed in holy water, I could've went to Trader Joe's across the way and brought my own to save money. Anyways, We ordered the gluten free version of penne ala vodka. This item comes with prosciutto. The server informed me I would not even be receiving anything close to the menu item that was already priced at $30. No vodka no prosciutto no pink sauce. So what was it that we were receiving? Still have no idea to this day. The server had such an attitude problem about everything from the start, we should've known it wasn't going to be a pleasant experience. We also put an order in for a Cesar salad as a starter no croutons. I asked if we could add onions to the salad. Insert eye roll from server here. She finished taking our order and walked away. Our salad arrived with our pasta, 30 mins later! The server made sure to bob and weave away from us as to not answer any of our questions. She did not want to come up with an explanation as to why it took 30 mins for a starter salad to arrive! The really nice busser was kind of enough to refill our waters and provide my 5 year old daughter with bread. My husband and I had our food come out before my daughters basic spaghetti with marina! Everyone knows you serve the kids food first before the adults, especially when it's simple pasta with marina already cooked in the back. Alas, our server was unaware of such hospitality. We flagged her down asking where our daughters food was, she said oh lemme check and never came back. The friendly busser came to the rescue with my daughters food. We finished our meal and asked for the check. We were shocked to see a $6 charge for gluten free pasta and a $5 charge for broccoli. We asked the server why so expensive if it's technically not penne ala vodka and substitute broccoli. She said that was policy. Wooooow. We then noticed a charge for $3. We asked what was this about? She said it was for the onions in the salad?!?!?! So you're telling me it was $4 to put 6 onion slices in a small cedar? Was it farmed to table in that very instance? In what universe is this acceptable? I've managed some high end restaurants and been bar manager at others, none of these \"standards\" would've been acceptable. Broccoli is nowhere near the price of prosciutto. Why would you charge someone for vodka sauce if they're not getting vodka sauce? She might as well charged me for a steak and said well it's the same thing. To round off the crap night, I had to ask the server 3 times if she could sing happy birthday to my daughter. She brought a cannoli with no candle or anything. She was too busy to even acknowledge my kid or smile at the very least. She set the plate before her and did not even try to light the candle. She just walked off! Two tables down it was someone else's birthday and what do you know? They had a wonderful server who got the whole restaurant to sing a joyous happy birthday to them and with a smile! Must've been a nice feeling. Explain to me why she's in the hospitality business again? Thanks for a horrible memory on a special day. Do not waste your time or money at this place unless you're a masochist and love flushing money down the drain. Go to the other Italian places in downtown summerlin or wolf gang puck. They always treat you with respect and never charge you extra."}
{"text":"A jewel in the Venetian you would miss if you weren't looking for it. I was so pleasantly surprised and pleased about the unstuffy vibe and focus on FOOD!   Read reviews about the filet mignon meatballs being the yummiest and juciest. So, of course I HAD to try 'em for myself as an app. Goodness, boy, do I ever agree. You could just eat the serving which comes with three meatballs and share an entree because these bad boys do their justice as a mini meal. The chef and owners of Trattoria Reggiano are not shy about their food. Oh, plus you are treated to homemade, soft garlic rolls as a starter. Mmmm.  A quaint and intimate restaurant, half the dining area is inside the tiny restaurant and half is out in front, what would typically be equated to the \"sidewalk\". I ate with my family in this latter area which I preferred because the inside seems a little tight.   Ok, on to the oh-so-tasty and al dente pasta entrees we all had. My linguini with clams in white sauce was so light and perfectly seasoned, and came with BIG, fresh clams! Family had the linguini carbonara and shrimp scampi. Sauteed in a buttered, olive oil sauce, the shrimp in the scampi was again, not a greedy amount. They were huge and fresh and not overdone.  The applewood smoked bacon pieces in the bolognese sauce for the carbonara really takes this dish to another level.  Service got better as the nice progressed but I can say see how others thought there was crankiness goin on. It's a tiny place and 2 waiters are pretty much doing everything. So, for that, couldn't give it a full 5 stars. But, i'd have to say that our waiter did warm up and took good care of us!! Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé had the Linguine with Clam Sauce and it was pretty good, but clams were a little overcooked. I had the Baked Ziti, and it was delicious! However, I thought it was a little funny that the pasta was actually penne not ziti. Unless ziti can be considered multiple types of pasta? News to me if that's the case."}
{"text":"Warm friendly service, inside the Venetian resort near the canal but not right on the water,  authentic busy atmosphere and fairly good food. We dined December 2014"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like this place. I had seen the one in the Venetian many times and it was always crowded. I now realize that that was filled with tourists, most likely one-time only patrons. The food here was kind of flat and monotonous. The marinara sauce is bland. This is a beautiful restaurant if a bit pretentious. I get a sense that this place is run by a heavy-handed egotistical owner or manager that cannot see-through to its problems. I watched the management while I was dining here, and they seemed stern and unaccommodating. Our waiter was very friendly, almost too much so. I will probably try it again, just in case I was there on a bad day. All in all however, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to try this place, I was reluctant. I am SO GLAD that I said OK! Our dinner was really great.  I ordered the caesar and cheese tortellini....I know a little boring I was feeling \"classic\" (don't judge! LOL). The caesar was dressing was creamy and flavorful. I think the tortellini was homemade. Not sure if it was made right there, but either way tasted very homestyle! Yes, that is a good thing!  My friend had an Arugula Salad - It was SO SO SO good! (better than my caesar) and spaghetti carbonara. Delish as well.  For desert we had a piece of chocolate cake that was as big as my head! There you go, judging again! LOL....It was GOOD!!! And no, we did not even eat 1/2 of it! Although I wanted to!   Great place, and it can get busy because Downtown Summerlin is catching on as the new spot to go play and eat! If you are thinking a weekend night, I suggest making reservations"}
{"text":"This tiny hole in the wall is easy to miss with all of the grand displays in Las Vegas.  We stopped here for dinner as part of a bachelorette celebration.  The service was really kind and friendly.  I was very happy with the attentiveness of the staff and how I was treated.  The food was good.  Not great, but the cost to taste ratio is good.  And in an over priced town that is a tough find.  I got the gnocchi pesto and I enjoyed it very much.  The rest of my group was in love with the bread knots they served with dinner.  Over all it was a positive experience."}
{"text":"Wow. First time and last time. Reservations for 6:45. Seated at 7:30. Service was terrible. I ordered primavera pizza. Soggy and tasteless. Sent it back and ordered Bolognese. Husband ordered Scampi. Pasta undercooked and tasteless. Shrimp were ok. Terrible experience. A lady came in with a dog that sat in a chair and we overheard this was a lady with the owner. Wow."}
{"text":"Amazing old school italian food!!! Back to the basics, no fancy reworked recipes, just good old Italian food!!! The meatballs are 100% ground up filet mignon ... OMG good!  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is bc it's soooo small."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the prices reasonable, the service friendly. Get the Bruschetta Pizza or the ziti. We go here everytime we go to Vegas. A perfect spot for a solid lunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here and it was delish!  We were seated quickly and the service was prompt.  I got the spaghetti with  filet mignon meatballs and they were delicious!  I don't think that any other meatball is going to ever compare to those!  I would highly recommend them.  My boyfriend got the calamari and normally I don't care for them - but these calamaris were good.  I would recommend this restaurant to a friend."}
{"text":"Great food, pizza  drinks amd service Moscow Mule was excellent and Garlic bread appatizer / olives awesome!!.. I had eggplant Parmesan which was good but the sauce was very Sweet boarding on A Chef Boyardee vibe!! The entertainment and outdoor patio is a nice bonus at DTS.. Hey Trattoria please just overhaul your red sauce and you got the 5th star!!"}
{"text":"Ironically none of us had pasta, but we did have Filet Mignon Giambotto,Veal Milanese, Spinach Salad, Filet Mignon Meatballs.  Meatballs were wonderful.  Tender and melt in your mouth goodness.  Warm spinach salad was great.  Loved the pecans and goat cheese.  Veal was good too.  Tender inside and crispy breading; lots of arugula on top.  The filet was great too.  Just one thing, it appears there were jalapenos or something that was really hot.   Did see green pepper like bits in the dish.  Not sure what was really hot so was surprised because we didn't think this was going to be a hot dish.  Overall, loved this place.  Service was top notch.  I'd like to come back to try the pasta."}
{"text":"A nice place to eat if you are wandering around the Venetian. Not one that I would personally seek out if I wasn't already on the property.   We got a Caesar salad and a pepperoni pizza. Crust is nice and thin. Pizza isn't cheap, but it was definitely delicious. Caesar salad was heavily overdressed, and I don't think they make their dressing from scratch.  Yes, they serve a garlicky house bread... while I love bread and find it a critical element at a nice restaurant, I wouldn't quite spooge my pants over theirs, but you be the judge."}
{"text":"Food was great!  First time here...quick bite in between showing homes today...Joli and I split a chicken parm sandwich...perfect for 2.  Our server Ricki was great!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"My first review of this restaurant was in October after we went with some friends and everything was delicious.  Well not so this time.  While the service was good it was not as good as last time.  Last time they brought out a plate of cheese, roasted peppers and red, green and black olives that were fantastic.  This time there was only one of those green olives on the plate and when I asked the waiter for the more and for the other colors he found a few more green ones and said that was all there were which I find hard to believe.  Last time the garlic knots were wonderful.  This time they were very doughy and undercooked although very brown on top.  I had the same meal, baked ziti and while last time it was delicious this time I could hardly eat it.  The other meals were just ok.  Nothing to rave about like our last visit.  Towards the end of our meal they sat a very large party behind us although there really wasn't enough room and the waitress kept bumping into me every time she had to get through.  At one point she told me I needed to move my chair in.  If we were not getting ready to leave I definitely would have said something.  I also think that either the prices went up or they have a higher priced menu because it is during the holidays but I can tell you that we probably will not be going back there."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and although it doesn't have a view of the canal it felt like a cafe in Italy with people watching from where patio table. We ordered Caesar salads, eggplant rollatini, and meatballs. We are still hungover and didn't feel like drinking but probably wine would have been nice. They gave us homemade rolls that you dipped in high-quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Very professional waitstaff and the food was delicious and prepared beautifully."}
{"text":"Never really experiencing Las Vegas done right and from eating most of my meals in Vegas at places off the strip, like dim sum at Ping Pang Pong.. I was excited to eat something at a touristy place.    Loving Italian food and all things pasta, I couldn't wait to be seated at this place.  We chose to sit in the not-so-outdoor dining area to people watch and enjoy the 'view'.    When our server came along he seemed to be nice enough as he took our drink orders first.  While waiting for him to come back to take our actual food orders another duo came and sat in the next table beside us.  He proceeded to take their drink orders and walked past our table even when we tried to flag him down.  As we waited for our drinks to come he once again passed us while chatting away with a fellow server.  WTF?  Finally giving up I decide to use the restroom while I tell my friend to order for me in case that husky slob of a waiter finally decides to come to our table.     When I get back surprisingly my friend has ordered for the both of us and even has his coke he ordered, however my glass of water is no where to be seen.  The other table who came in and ordered after us has both of their drink orders as well as some bread on the table.  20 minutes have passed and we only have one drink and no bread.   We wait another 10 minutes and I still don't have my damn water or any bread and by that time I'm starving.  While during the whole time our incompetent server is leaning at the bar chatting away.    Who the fuck hired this fool?  In the end we ask another server for a refill on my friend's coke, once we get it we proceed to walk out with glass of coke in hand.  I bet the imbecile didn't even realize we left and came to the empty table with both entrees.    I would come again, just because I've heard the food is pretty good, but if moron ends up being my waiter again, I'll be sure as hell to throw a bitch fit with management and insist I have someone else."}
{"text":"this place impressed me so much. all the waiters are Italians, and they are all very nice, polite, and funny!! i've been craving for real italian food, so i yelped and accidentally found this place. i love how this place is so small, so they can keep the qualify of their food and service. you can tell this place is authentic italian from their aglio e olio and their tiramisu. it is the kind of italian that i've always been looking for. i'm surprised that i can find it on the trip to vegas with my family."}
{"text":"Great service from Ricki, even better food. Be sure to order the calamari. The garlic knots hint at how good their pizza must be. Penne ala vodka had a great, subtile guiancale flavor to it. The Linguine with the white clam sauce was perfectly seasoned in a slightly thick bodied sauce of deep complexity. The clams, in shell, were ocean fresh, impeccably clean and plentiful. The linguine was prepared perfectly al dente. Service was like a light breeze, barely noticeable, but just there and appreciated. Consider re training your hostess, as we requested a quiet table and she attempted to seat us in front of the restroom!"}
{"text":"We like simple dishes especially Pasta. I love the margarita pizza and aglio olio pasta. Service is good and you don't have to wait very long for the food. The cappuccino is expensive and some of the dishes are a little over priced  but this is Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night and I liked it. We were seated outside so it was a little chilly, but at least they had the heaters to make up for it. Their garlic bread is delicious and is a great way to start your meal. I had the chicken francese and really enjoyed it. The chicken was cooked right and it was tender and juicy, while the pasta was alright. It's pretty awesome that they have a live performer as well when I went. I can see this place as a great place to go for a date night."}
{"text":"I have worked at the Venetian|Palazzo for 8 years, and eaten at almost every restaurant here. I can honestly say that Trattoria Reggiano is my favorite. It's got a classic Italian vibe to it, and its location inside the Grand Canal Shoppes makes it a great place to people watch. The food is always perfectly prepared, and I've always had great service (tonight Eric was my server, he's Fantastic!).  If you come to the Venetian|Palazzo, you must try this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner recently and had some first impressions. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The ambience was bustling but not loud. There was a guy singing pretty good covers on the patio but not loud as to impede normal conversation. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and helpful with the menu. I ordered a glass of pinot grigio, a caprese salad and spaghetti carbonara. The wine was dry and crisp, perfect for what I wanted. The salad came out first. Large everything; tomato slices, basil leaves and a ball of fresh mozzarella the size of a billiard ball. The tomatoes were as you would expect in the winter, the cheese was divine. Overall above average for the salad. The spaghetti carbonara was exquisite. Flavors, textures and smells all worked together to produce a fine dish I would order often. Good ambience, great food and friendly staff all come together extremely well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised,  that's why I gave this place 4 stars.  This restaurant is located right on the fringe of the \"food court\" area.  The location leads one to think it's going to be very \"bleh\" experience.     The average service was what I expected but the food was much more delicious than expected. The garlic bread was great,  the carbonara was amazing, and the spaghetti was excellent.    Honestly, this place was better than Rao's at Caesars Palace and much cheaper too."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant in an informal friendly atmosphere. Food sensational.  Everything made to order. Great cocktail menu. All entrees made to order. Veal chop amazing, mussels in white sauce fabulous? Cant say enough good things. Great red sauce and meat balls.  Pasta sensational.  So was the broccoli Rob.  Their manager, Wendy, a pleasure to work with.  Friendly, came over to the table to make sure everything was alright. 5 stars.  Highly recommend! Mike and Beverly, Henderson"}
{"text":"Went back again on this trip. And if I thought the lobster ravioli was delicious I was even more impressed with the Penne with Vodka sauce and prosciutto. So unbelievable!!!  Can't wait for my next trip to Vegas so we can come back!"}
{"text":"Pork was great. Good experience but not over the top. Not sure why a 3-star but I am comparing it to other experiences that were 4-star. Perhaps it's the cost/experience factor that lead me to this rating."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Real Italians and real pasta. Al dente to perfection!! Great service too. Will return!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food on the strip! The carbonara is great! Not too heavy, just perfect! Calamari is good. However is service is the best!!!"}
{"text":"What a major disappointment!  I ordered penne primavera and it was served sitting in warm water. There was no flavor at all.  I pointed it out to the waiter, who replaced it, and also had it taken off the bill.  The replacement was ok, but not flavorful enough to bring me back.  I truly wonder if the food quality is dependent on who is in the kitchen.  The reviews go from 5 stars to \"blah\". I also ordered the kale peanut salad which was too acidic for my taste.  The two stars are only for the waiter, \"Giovanni\" who I would give five stars, but I don't want anyone to think it is for the food.  I think management needs to do a better job on what leaves the kitchen and goes to the table."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner- we wanted Italian and the other restaurants had to long a wait.  The service and food was very good.  The location should have overlooked the gondolas- I think.  The foot traffic because of the shops could be a bit much. Wife was reluctant to eat here because of that.  Each had a glass of wine, split an appetizer and a plate of pasta each. $80.  Sorta pricy, but it's Vegas and your paying for eating on the strip."}
{"text":"This place was delicious, especially compared to everything I had consumed this past weekend in Vegas... it had to have been one of the best meals I had during my trip. However, know that I had food at 7am like a crackhead without sleep, room service, nasty sushi and crawfish...   I ordered the Linguine with shrimp and my company ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Both yummy dishes and totally affordable on a Vegas budget.   Also, the service wasn't bad! I read reviews here about the bad service, but our server was great!"}
{"text":"Walking away after standing at the hostess station for 3 mins while being stared at by the kitchen staff and not seated or acknowledged.   Guess they don't want our business."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and this was our first experience at Trattoria restaurant and we truly loved it.  The food was excellent, between the 4 of us we had lasagna, swordfish, shrimp scampi and chicken with noodles.  The waiter, Sergio and manager Dora treat all their customers like special guests down to every detail.  We will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"My cousin is in town visiting so I got to have a nice staycation since I love in Vegas. We were craving some \"good\" Italian food so decided to try Trattoria Reggiano based on other Yelp reviews. I must say they more than exceeded my expectations! Every single server who we came in contact with had a smile on their face & a pleasant voice. I asked one of the servers of he could recommend one of their red wines by the glass. He said he could & would be right back. He returned with 3 wine bottles, gave me tastes of each,  & allowed me to choose which one I preferred. I greatly appreciated this! I then asked about bread & he came back with the most amazing garlic knots! Oh wow! Lastly our meals were delicious. My cousin had the chicken marsala, which she said was wonderful & I had the cappollini pomodoro. The tomato sauce was full of flavor, not just tomato. Everything about our meal was completely satisfying. I cannot wait to go to their restaurant in Downtown Summerlin now!!! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"In the meandering maze of mercantilism that is the shops and restaurants and kiosks of the Venetian's Grand Canal is hidden a very nice Italian gem.  Although not easy to find, once there you will find a very cute, mom and pop vibe eatery with tables extending out into the walking area.  Depending on the time of year and body mass index of those strolling the shops, this can be good people watching or good impetus to cut down on portions eaten.  We arrived and were immediately seated by a quiet, older gentleman with what seemed to be an old world accent.  The orders, food, and flow continued seamlessly sand resulted in a very satisfying dining experience.  The Good: Cute atmosphere.  If you prefer not to be on display in the walkway while you eat, sit inside and enjoy a cute kind of deli feel. The bread they bring with the meal tasted fresh, hot, and garlicky/buttery like good bread should.  Our waiter was very kind about accommodating our individual requests (\"no ma'am I'm afraid the kitchen does not have any fettucine pasta today, but the tortellini is excellent with the alfredo sauce\" and \"I'm sure we can substitute the puttanesca sauce with your Chicken Parmesan\"), and his helper kept our drinks filled. Everything flowed nicely from start to finish.  The tortellinni alfredo was good as advertised.  They used the large pillow style pasta that I normally associate with ravioli, but they were cooked perfectly.  The sauce relied heavily on butter for it's flavor, but then it's alfredo.  If you want diet food, order sliced fruit. My Chicken Parm had nice flavor and the breading was not as thick and KFC-like as I have had at many spots recently (although sometimes that heavy fried/batter thing can be a guilty pleasure.) They were nice enough to make my side of spaghetti with the puttanesca sauce instead of the normal pomodoro which makes me a fan from jump.  I'm going to give the puttanesca a 7/10 just because I like a little stronger garlic flavor and more fresh basil ribbons, but that is just my quirkiness.  Did I mention the great bread?  The Bad: Nothing.  The Mediocre:  Getting to the bathrooms to wash your hands before the meal requires navigating about 4 right turns and not missing the passage off top the side, but then that was my experience of the whole Venetian Grand Canal Shopping area itself.   Overall:  Nice Italian food, in a difficult to find location, but still well worth the effort."}
{"text":"The service was top notch. No complaints there - our drinks were always filled and my brother took his last sip of his beer just as the waiter asked if he'd like another. Really on top of things. However... The prices they charge for their food is a little ridiculous. I got the chicken parm and while it was good it was just your regular chicken parm, not worth the $26. The salmon my mom got was dry and flavorless. The pesto gnocchi my sister got was super bland. The pizza my brother got was good but didn't really have much to it in terms of flavor. The entire meal was definitely over priced. They had an Italian band playing too. And his voice was nice, but it was really too loud. We can barely talk to each other without screaming. It kinda threw it all off. Maybe it would be a better ambience for a one on one date? But not for a family. We won't be back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"We have been here three times and all three times I have been very disappointed.  The service is great but the seafood dishes have been very disappointing!  The first time I ordered linguini and clams. at least six clams didn't open and the sauce was bland and flavorless and the clams had a very fishy taste and smell.  They did give me additional clams but half of them had broken shells that led me to believe they took the ones that didn't open and just broke the shells to get the clams out. I didn't eat them because if a clam shell doesn't open on its own it is because the clam is already dead and who knows how long it has been dead.  Second time there I had the shrimp scampi. The shrimp were not over cooked but they were stuffed!?  The breading they were stuffed with were soaking in oil.  There was no delightful garlic/wine sauce it was just butter and stuffing.  So I removed the stuffing and ate the six or seven shrimp.  The third time I ordered the shrimp and linguini in their red sauce.  The shrimp tasted very fishy again and the red sauce was utterly bland! It was extremely disappointing.    My husband had their veal parmesan and said it was good except that the veal wasn't pounded down and the thickness was a little off-putting and a too thick breading covered the veal.  He also had, on another visit, their carbonara and he liked it a lot and on our third visit he had the baked ziti and thought it was very good but the meatballs were  horrible.  Our friend had the lobster ravioli in a pink sauce.  The pink sauce had a very mild flavor and he said it was okay.  The garlic knot bread is good and the service is good.  The manager or owners ask you how everything is and we always say it's good but I just don't like to make negative remarks in front of their customers so this review is more for them and I just pray the read it.    We love everything about the restaurant but the seafood dishes need a major overhaul and they need to remake their meatball recipe."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Its very tiny- only about 5 tables inside and then a more tables outside in the venetian.  We got the arugula salad which was very fresh and simple, the pasta e fagioli soup which was very light and scrumptious.  All the food seemed to have been made very authentically. My sister had the swordfish, my mom- the linguine bolognese, and I- the spaghetti alili e olio.  Everything was really good. The best thing about this place was our server- an older Italian man who was so accomodating. We wanted wines by the glass that were not on the \"wine by the glass  list\" and he said, you can do whatever you want. I thought that was really nice of him.   Cool ambience, great food, and great service."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was terrible. Took over an hour to get our food. I don't suggest coming here unless you have three hours of spare time to eat a half decent italian meal."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place to me. I was hesitant at first, but then just decided to try it out. I was very pleased. I went with my husband and our 9 yr old son. I had the Gnocci al Pesto and...OH. MY. GOD. It was so delicious. My husband had the Baked Ziti with Meatballs - it looked do good, I had to taste it. Oh the cheesy goodness! And my son had the pepperoni pizza - normal 9 yr old boy food. He loved it too! He ate more than half of it which is a miracle in itself, because he's not a big eater. Our server, Theresa was very nice and very pleasant. The restaurant is small and quaint but felt authentic and welcoming. We couldn't have been happier with our experience, and will definitely be returning soon...especially since it is our new favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. I even like it more than Maggiano's."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food, great service and great ambiance. I love the garlic knots instead of bread. Our server was nice and funny. I love the open kitchen and the classy decor throughout the restaurant. My food was delicious. The chocolate cake is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, very good service. Food was good. Pizza seems to be their best menu item. Garlic knots were very good. Baked ziti was good. Portion sizes are decent. Surprisingly, filet meatballs weren't as good as I thought they would be - caprese was presented nicely but lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Came her for dinner after a family friend's wedding. I ordered the \"your way\" with strawberry. Had to send it back since it was awful, but I got the Italian sangria. It was much better. I ordered the swordfish. Freakin delicious. My bf ordered the chicken parmigiana. It was tasty, but there was nothing special about it. Other people at our table ordered the lasagna (said it was the best Italian food they've ever had), linguine bolognese (couldn't stop chowing down) and the linguine in clam sauce (said the clams were delightful. All-in-all a great experience. Very kind and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Cute cafe style restaurant across from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at the Venetian. Expect friendly staff and cramped seating. The pizzas are great, I specially enjoyed the veggie one. We also had the clam vongole which offered a handsome portion of seafood over perfectly cooked pasta. Great to see many Europeans eating here!"}
{"text":"The original Trattoria Reggiano location inside the Venetian is pretty popular, and has had a 4 star average for as long as I can remember. So, when we first arrived to this new second location, it wasn't too shocking to hear we'd have a little bit of wait (30-45 minutes) even on a Sunday at 7pm. But it wasn't until nearly an hour and fifteen minutes later that we walked in and got seated on the patio of what might be the smallest restaurant in Downtown Summerlin.   Up until we got seated, there had only been one other party that put there name down to wait. In the time that we waited the place really started to clear out, and shortly after we got seated, there was only a handful of tables sat. The place was pretty much dead. But for whatever reason, a table of about 6 people had the whole staffs attention. They had been there the whole time we waited for a table, and were there during our whole meal. Obviously either very close friends, or family of someone associated with the restaurant. Food was coming out to them in waves, and nearly every staff member was waiting on them hand and foot. It took 20 minutes just for our waiter to come over after being sat, and throughout the meal, it didn't improve. Drinks and food took forever to come out, we had to ask for refills multiple times, and the guy seemed to barely know the menu. To put it lightly, the service sucked. Even if every waiter here was new, this restaurant has enough experience that they shouldn't have untrained staff, or even crappy service in general.   When it comes to the menu, it looks like it's pretty much exactly the same as the original location. They have a variety of classic Italian dishes, some pizza, seafood, etc. Pricing doesn't seem to be any different, and is about average for this style of Italian restaurant.   We were brought out an order of complimentary garlic knots. The flavor was actually pretty good and they had good texture, but holy friggin' grease. These things felt like they were made and then just rolled in oil. They also brought a little pepper, olive and cheese tray. It was okay, but I'm glad I didn't pay for either. Not really an impressive start.  I had pretty much already made up my mind on what I was going to order before we even came here. The filet meatballs sound good, and usually get great reviews. So, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The noodles were cooked well, obviously not hand made or anything, but decent. What really let me down was the meatball. I'd say mentioning filet mignon in the title is just a way to sucker you into ordering them. If there is filet mignon in them, the amount is so little it's impossible to taste. They really just taste like straight up pork meatballs with no seasoning. At $14 for an appetizer order of meatballs, and $18 for the spaghetti and meatballs, there should be no doubt that filet mignon is in them. Their supposed house made pomodoro sauce is alright, but this is far from an $18 plate.  At this point, I was done and not even thinking about trying their dessert. But most of my table wanted dessert, and oddly enough, it was the best thing about this place. Sort of. They have a \"homemade\" chocolate cake that looks just like the garbage Claim Jumper serves, so I passed on trying that. Their tiramisu was excellent though, and really was the saving grace of the night. I'd literally come back just for that, and would likely try the ricotta cheesecake too.  Maybe I expected too much...but with a pretty dang successful restaurant, in the Venetian of all places, I thought TR would have a lot more to offer. Long waits, horrible service, and below average food just wasn't what I had hoped for."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous food!!!!! Must eat here when in Vegas. We will be back. Excellent service and our waiter, Eric, was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations for pairings of dishes and wines. We had the lobster ravioli, spaghetti and meatballs, and tortellini. The tortellini was out of this world!!!  A must eat!!"}
{"text":"We came to Vegas for 4 nights and we had such a good meal here our first night that we came back for our last! So yummy! They even accommodated my special requests, no extra charge and no funny faces for not ordering directly off the menu. I can't rave enough. The wine list is superb, the pasta is fresh and the service is excellent! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. There is nothing better than good food and even better service. The filet mignon meatballs are a must! We ordered these based off other yelp reviews and were not disappointed. The food was authentic, flavorful, the pastas are cooked to perfection and the service here sets the standard for all great restaurants to follow.   Id like to give a shoutout to Eric, our server, who was personable, funny, attentive and fun. His recommendations are great and he gives exceptional service.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"Do not come here unless you want to be intimidated and made to feel stupid.   I give this establishment 0 stars but Yelp won't allow me to give less than 1 star.  I came here tonight (December 24) for our first meal with my mother after we arrived in Vegas. I found a killer vacation deal over the Xmas holiday and thought why not do something different this year. Anyways,  I found this restaurant on Yelp (like most restaurants I visit while out of town). It had great reviews and I was also very excited to try the buttery buns Yelpers raved about.  My experience here was terrible. I have never felt so unwelcomed and ridiculed. The buttery buns arrived at our table with a bottle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I asked our middle aged Italian server if I could have another plate to pour the EVOO and vinegar in. He flat out told me \"this is not how we eat our bread. Use the same plate you have\". I was completely floored and just looked at him. I guess he realized that wasn't a good answer. He then grabbed a side plate from the empty table near me and pretty much threw it on the table. The underlying tone of his comment was condescending and made me feel like the way I like to eat my bread was completely irrational. I should have asked him who this \"we\" is. I didn't know a oil and vinegar police existed.  Our server then ignored us while being attentative to all neighboring patrons. I was quite peeved and blurted out loudly- \"the service here is TERRRIBLE\" so that all my neighboring patrons could hear me and also conveniently while he was serving them. This quickly changed how he treated us. He quickly came over and asked me how the pizza was. I said \"it's OK\", then he has the audacity to say \"it's ONLY OK?\". There was no underlying joke behind his comment. I just ignored his comment and he left.   We quickly finished our meal and asked our busser to send the bill. I paid, leaving a 5% tip (the bussers shouldn't be punished, even though they only get a small cut of the tip).   On my way out I flagged down the manager, a middle aged Italian woman, and told her the situation. The first thing she says is \"what do you want from this?\", as thought she thought I was expecting a comped meal. I said \"nothing, I already paid and am not happy with the service\". She then defended our server saying that he is very good and that I misinterpreted him and that he was probably joking. I was thinking in my head what a joke THIS IS. No wonder service is so bad when management can't set an example of basic customer service and makes the customer feel stupid. I told the manager we are leaving since this was hopeless. The manager then clues in and says \"let's discuss this with the server and have him apologize to you.\" I declined and she told me to come back tomorrow and she will make sure we \"get served right\". No thank you and we walked away.   Do yourself a favor and don't eat here.  There are plenty of other delicious Italian choices on the strip which provide excellent or even decent service and good food."}
{"text":"Wow! Pesto was GREAT! But for $22 I don't think so. If you want something a little better than Olive Garden COME! But also CHEAP ALCOHOL"}
{"text":"While waiting on friends and deciding what to eat the first night in Vegas, our friends in our group recommended this restaurant. Take the escalator in the Palazzo forum, above the waterfall, and it's not hard to find, but it's a small restaurant. Even though they have additional seating out in the corridor/walkway, you're there for the food. If you come during rush hour for dinner, be prepared to wait depending on how large your party is. We had 6 and it took us about 45 min - 1 hr. Wait was totally worth it for the following reasons:  1) They serve hot fresh bread, garlic olive oil bread with option of dipping in balsamic  vinegar and olive oil  2) The portions are filling and very affordable for Las Vegas prices - $16 - $30ish for entrees (I recommend the pasta)  3) Service is attentive and they speak Italian (great sign for an Italian restaurant)  I personally had the Linguine with Shrimp Marinara and it was the highlight meal of the trip. I would love to take a date to this restaurant or a small group of friends. It's not the most romantic environment, but the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I leave very few reviews as you can see...  THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!  Every part of it from the garlic bread that starts the dinner to full bellies after perfect lasagna, the best kale salad you'll ever eat and crisp/light calamari...and so much more...  This place is legit.  Every time we go to vegas this is our ritual. Run, don't walk to this joint. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! We were visiting Las Vegas for 4 days and ended up eating at Trattoria Reggiano 4 times! One day we ate lunch that was so good we went back for dinner. From the spaghetti and meatballs, tortellini and cream sauce and lasagna to the cannoli you can't go wrong! If it would never embarrassed my wife I would've licked my plate. No matter what Italian restaurant we go to. I always compare our food to the Trattoria Reggiano and it never matches up! We will be going back many many times!"}
{"text":"Alright, decided to try this place out before seeing 'O'.  Here are my thoughts:  The bread was ok, I guess I was hyped up by the yelp reviews and let down once I got there.  The bread reminded me of the garlic knots at Sbarros, or the crazy bread at little caesars..lol and it was a bit worse because it wasnt even warm/hot.  So, I guess if i wasnt all hyped up by reviews, i wouldnt have been disappointed.  Either way, it was just ok.  I had the chicken parm and my husband had the chicken fresca (something like that).  We both enjoyed our meals.  My husband ate his and then finished mine.  I dont really think there is anything special about this place above and beyond major italian places like Maggianos.  Overall, good food, tasty, would come back, but nothing to write home about.  Oh! and the seating was kinda strange out in the open.  Maybe if they had some of those movie theatre ropes there would feel like some separation between you and the women with the baby in the stroller walking by..."}
{"text":"Try to eat here last night since it got good reviews. Just letting you know the place is CLOSED. They are expanding!"}
{"text":"This place a excellent! The spaghetti and meatballs were the best I have ever had. The staff were very nice and helpful. My husband and I both enjoyed the food and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We always saw this place while staying at the Venetian.  Decided to stop by when we saw some tables available; and let me tell you: we were not disappointed! Small place, but very delicious food!  The staff is very courteous and attentive.  The pizza Marguerite: nice and crispy crust, very good tomato sauce and cheese.  The spaghetti and meatballs: mmmm delicious! The linguine carbonara: very tasty and yummy.  Will definitely recommend it and come back to eat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat lunch in Downtown Summerlin. Rikki is always so attentive and friendly. She knows what I like to eat, and how I like it prepared. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Yummy!  The garlic bread and the Chicken Parmesan very really good.  The Pizza primavera, I have had better, it wasn't comparable to the other dishes we had.  Pricey, as expected from a restaurant at Venetian with ambiance and all.  Would recommend to eat."}
{"text":"Happened to be in Las Vegas again with family who had never dined here so I told them they had to try it.  We made a reservation although it didn't look like we needed one for as early as we had dinner.  We had the meatballs for an appetizer and actually had to order a 2nd portion because we devoured the first order.  I had the linguine bolognese for dinner and it was phenomenal.  My dad had linguine with clam sauce and really enjoyed it.  My mom had a pizza and said it was the best she'd had since we got back from Italy.  My aunt had the eggplant parmesan and said it was outstanding.  Our food was superb, service was great.  My aunt actually wanted to go here again the following night but didn't want to walk all the way back to the Venetian.  Going to this restaurant is my favorite part about coming to Vegas!  You can't go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"Recommend:  Tortellini Alfredo: was my favorite last time and it's still good. Cheesy on the inside with the middle just perfection.  Spaghetti and meatballs: I looked at my friend with a face that said \" really?!\" But it turned out to be so good. Definitely will get again.   Service as always was excellent. Once again I had john who took care of us. Very friendly. One of those servers with the kind of great personality that is hard to find.   Restaurant has expanded since the last time I came. PROMISING!   Other items:  Latte: my friend ordered this. Very coffee taste.  I like my things sweet. My friend loved the taste though. Probably more recommended for those who prefer black coffee (but not too harsh)"}
{"text":"One of the new additions to the Downtown Summerlin dining scene. The dining room is nicely decorated with warm colors and is brightly lit. The outdoor patio has comfortable seating and  has some privacy from the adjacent foot traffic. Ceiling fans and overhead heaters make this a year round venue. Our party of four chose the patio on this evening. We were seated immediately and welcomed by several staff members. Our server Amanda was attentive and helpful. She had a up beat attitude and I felt that she was truly interested in providing us with great service. Amanda along with her associates  followed up throughout the meal.  The complementary dinner rolls with bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar were provided  for the table. We ordered the Filet Mignon Meatballs as a starter. The three large meatballs were plenty for sharing. The shaved Parmigiano Reggiano was offered as a topping. Four different entrees were ordered. Eggplant Parmigiana was  layered in traditional pomodoro sauce and lots of melted mozzarella. The Chicken Caesar Salad included several large pieces of grilled chicken. The Lobster Ravioli was topped with shrimp, sauteed in a pink sauce and white wine. The ravioli pillows just melted in your mouth and the shrimp were tender and juicy. The Chicken Francese was a breast sauteed in lemon-white wine sauce and a touch of butter served with spaghetti. Both the Eggplant and Chicken Francese were especially large and resulted in some to take home. All of the entrees were cooked perfectly to our satisfaction. Freshly shaved Parmigiano Reggiano was also offered as a topping for the entrees. Two desserts were ordered for sharing. Ricotta cheese cake was moist with a long lasting cheese flavor. The tiramisu is served in a goblet with two sticks of cookies. The saucer on which the goblet sits has drizzled caramel sauce. The location of the caramel adds eye appeal but scooping it up is not easy. I would rate the tiramisu as just OK.  One note on the restrooms. A restaurant this size should have more than one restroom. As I waited in line a server mentioned that there is a public restroom next door to the restaurant. The woman behind me decided to check it out but she returned to say the line at that one was longer."}
{"text":"This had many good reviews so decided to check it out. The service was friendly but very slow and forgetful. When the food came- we ordered the veal Marsala special- it was very bland. One of us ordered the baked ziti with the same response. Nothing here to write home about."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. We ordered Pasta Fagioli soup. This is my favorite soup and this was by far the best I ever ate.  I  then had Spaghetti Aglio E Olio and surprisingly (I felt) was a very small portion but it was very flavorful. I had a side of meatballs  which consisted of 2 nice size meatballs. Everyone has their own preference of how a meatball should be made/taste  and to me these were perfect! My husband had chicken parmigiana with spaghetti and the chicken was huge.  He said it was good. Our server was Ricki and she was great. Though quite expensive.....$70.00 for lunch! (no dessert, no drinks except for one soda) we enjoyed the food and service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was awesome, the prices were a little too much in our opinion.   I also do not agree with restaurants that charge for gluten free options. Being gluten free for some isn't just some fad diet. They charge $5 for gluten free options. It's not fair for those who have no choice in being gluten free. That's why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"We were walking back to hotel when we passed this small Italian restaurant and decide to eat there especially when we saw other customers food which appeared to be appetizing. The offered fresh garlic bread, which was delicious! We ordered the calamari which was really good yet bad for you because it was fried. The texture of the calamari was soft, well seasoned and hot. The shrimp scampi portion was huge. Depending how you like your pasta some like it with some flavor but I like my pasta with flavor. I guess the only good part of this is that they didn't use that much butter! :) The shrimp however was perfect not over cooked, nicely stuffed and well seasoned. We also had the Salsiccia pizza which was delicious. It's a pretty small restaurant that serves pretty good food. But when the employees speak Italian you kind of know the food is legit."}
{"text":"Best place in downtown summerlin for food quality! The place is small but it's nice!   All the items we ordered were fresh and tasted amazing! We will travel here even if no plans at DT summerlin...recommend for everyone!  I recommend a reservation due to the lack of size"}
{"text":"This was a pretty solid Italian restaurant in the Venetian! It's a smaller restaurant and I believe that is why the service was on point. Some of these bigger restaurants in Vegas are not dishing out good service. We walked in around 8:30 with no reservations and got seated right away. I took a look at the specials menu and as soon as I read Cavatelli, with turkey sausage and broccoli rabe I was sold. Cavatelli is my favorite pasta and it's something that you may have a hard time finding on menus. They also bring you complementary garlic knots. These knots were so warm and covered in Parmesan cheese. They give you really nice portions so you will not leave hungry. Portions are important to me. If you are spending big money on a pasta dish there better be lots of pasta to go around. Our Italian server was my favorite too! He was very tentative and even brought out a cannoli for dessert. Cannolis are the way to my heart and this was probably one of the best cannolis I have ever had."}
{"text":"The food here was very nice and the service was second to none. But never order a glass of wine you will only get a quarter glass at $11 for a Zinfandel. Not good. And the food also is a little high someone has to tell them that they are not on the strip. This is my second time there and I will return after I get a loan from the bank. LOL. Give it a try just bring a little extra cash. The first time I came here I love it and still do. I just don't remember it so pricey."}
{"text":"We stopped in to the restaurant with my wife and two small girls (5 & 9 years old) on our family vacation. We were not sure what to expect, but it was one of the best meals we have ever had. First, the staff was very friendly. Our server could not have been nicer. Also, everyone who stopped by our table with food or drinks were very nice as well. So great with our kids. Our server suggested a nice bottle of wine which was amazing, yet reasonably priced. My wife and I had salads while the staff brought the kids out fresh blueberries to eat while we waited for our food. In addition, they also brought out the most AMAZING garlic knots I have ever had. They were almost like garlic muffins with butter and garlic...WOW!  Our dinner was great. I had spaghetti with the filet mignon meatballs which was very tasty. My wife had a delicious vegi pizza. Kids has basic pasta which they ate up quickly. Overall, just and amazing meal. I really wish we lived closer so we could dine at this restaurant all the time. Great food, good prices and kid friendly...what could be better. I highly suggest restaurant and can wait to visit when I am in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Went here after reading the good reviews. That was not a good decision. The food was only Ok. Not bad, but not the quality I would have expected.  The rolls were not warm which I would think they should be with the garlic and all. One was flat out cold.   The server was horrible. Didn't seem to care that we existed. I asked if there was a special and he just shouted to a coworker and came back with basically \"brocoli and something.\" I had to finally flag him down just to ask for the check.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time I had the spaghetti and meatballs, and the latter was supposed to be filet mignon, so it was tender and juicy. One of the best meatballs I have had. Second time, 11 months later, I had carbonara. I don't think it is traditionally made, as in the cream seemed to thick to me, and the pork did not seem like guincale, but it was OK. On the noisy side and not really a top-notch romantic place, not truly \"fine dining\", but good old robust Italian eats, worthy as regular Vegas place to re-visit."}
{"text":"The second star is for the garlic knots. We ordered a pizza. I've lived in NYC, I've had great pizza. Been wanting to try this place for a while. I'm not exaggerating: the pizza came to the table cold and soaking and flimsy as a wet noodle. Literally like a cold, wet noodle. The \"crust\" was so incredibly thin and floppy and wet and cold that I started to take a photo for this review BUT before I could do that, a woman collapsed in the restaurant and hit her head and wasn't getting up. Please understand this next part and read carefully: I was sitting at the far end of the restaurant and there was a ridiculous amount of servers working in this place. Like two servers to a customer. At least 15. The bartender, servers, hostess, and manager just stood there like stunned sheep, so I was the first person to call 911. After running across the restaurant by myself, they obviously had no kind of training in place for an emergency situation. People acted like I was a hero for merely possessing common sense. After the ambulance showed up and took the woman away, the general manager commended me and comped our entire bill. I explained the pizza issue to him and he acted like he knew about it and was embarrassed, but here's the kicker: the guy was from New York....and he allows his kitchen to serve sloppy cold pizza!? But hey, the free garlic knots were incredible!"}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst.   -Garlic knots- good but if you've been to C&O trattoria in Southern California then these garlic knots have nothing on C&O. I was able to stop myself after two pieces which is saying a lot. It's good but too doughy and not enough garlic -lobster ravioli was pretty good, especially the sauce  -calamari was just ok- don't like it when I get more tentacles than rings (btw if you're ever interested in a this American life about calamari.... )   Overall, it was an average meal for Vegas. My travel mates picked this restaurant for a Friday night- I would have chosen differently. Save room for dessert if you can- the chocolate cake looked amazing"}
{"text":"This place was great. The atmosphere is very welcoming. The staff was professional and accommodating with  menu items. If your a seafood lover please know there is no scallops and lobster on the menu. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and they gave her cute bday card ....\"Classy touch\"  All this after we arrived 15 min. late for our dinner reservation. .. Party of 9"}
{"text":"Great dinning experience, the service was amazing and the food was great"}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant! Last time I had antipasto platter & penne a la vodka which both were amazing! Tonight's calamari & baked ziti were equally as good! Friendly staff that was very personable! Bethany at the bar was awesome and had great suggestions! Easy to see why there were so many regulars at the bar recognized by name !  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food here was ok, nothing to write home about.  We had a large party and we got several different items.  The biggest problem I had is why I'm giving them 2 stars - their bartender apparently doesn't know what Blue Moon (the original wheat) is.  They had both the regular wheat on the menu and the \"seasonal\", which is a white IPA.  I told him that I wanted the original Blue Moon, to which he proceeded to argue with me telling me that Blue Moon IS an IPA. He said that they'd been getting people complaining because they thought it wasn't an IPA.  That's because it is most definitely not!!  He assured me that it was the regular Blue Moon so I ordered one.  It was the seasonal.  I didn't want to argue with him any further so I just let it go and someone else at the table drank it.    I hope that management will take this review into account and train their staff about the difference here.  This isn't an uncommon beer and most places carry it, so for it to taste like a completely different type of beer means that either your lines are mixed up or your staff doesn't know what they're serving.  If you're out of the regular that's fine, but don't try to tell me that something I've been drinking for over 6 years is something that it's not!  Please see my picture for proof of what I'm referring to."}
{"text":"OK... first of all, garlic knots. They're denser than most places but really really good. If you like garlic, get these.  Their lobster ravioli with crab and shrimp is really good. I liked this the most of all the things we got. Not a huge fan of their pizza. Their Linguine Bolognese was good, but not something I'd stay up at night and hunger for.  They also serve a special italian bottled lemon iced tea. It's good!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the place had an awesome atmosphere. The food was also top notch! We are vegetarians and had some great options to choose from."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.   Very good food with a good atmosphere, but the overall experience of the meal just didn't meet the standard of the other location in the strip. We had he house specialty pasta which came with a red sauce, sundried tomatoes, and spinach, as well as the gnocchi in a vodka sauce. Both pastas were delicious and fresh but extremely bland, with not much going on besides the pasta and sauce. I guess that's normal for good Italian but I usually enjoy busier dishes. The bread, garlic knots, were actually quite good and I devoured 2, especially dipping in the entree sauces. We were finally given a complimentary olive and pepper dish to start out that was just par. Drinks are expensive and not very good to be frank. I ordered a Manhattan and it was just alcohol thrown into a glass, with no real craft. The house wine is $11 and truly is a house wine. Meal came to around a surprisingly expensive $70. Not worth the cost in my opinion with service underwhelming as well. But nonetheless a strip type of restaurant in downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I will be back next time I'm in Vegas.  The garlic knots were to die for and the lasagna was probably the best I've ever had.  The atmosphere was also very nice and romantic.  We went around brunch time so the shopping area wasn't too busy yet, but I imagine if you go later in the afternoon or for dinner you can do plenty of people watching.  Don't waste your time looking in the food court for something to eat, come here!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and reasonably priced for Vegas. Very large portions so come hungry! Our waiter Sammy was the best part of the experience and took wonderful care of us! He brought the Italian hospitality and service to Vegas. Thank you Sammy for treating us like princesses the morning after a long night in Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place.  The wait time and the other reviews made me salivating for a meal at Trattoria Reggiano and I insisted that the rest of my group eat here at least once before we left Vegas the last time I went.  AMBIENCE: The Venetian was my home away from home for the weekend last month when I was in Vegas, so it was in a convenient location.  Walking past the place, it looks like a small, quaint little restaurant, but inviting at the same time with the warm lighting.  There are also tables that sort of stretch out of the restaurant, so people walking by can get a good look of what people are eating and the diners are able to people watch.  It was a little bit awkward waiting for a table because there really isn't any designated \"waiting area\".  Standing too close made me feel like a stalker and standing too far keeping watch on whether my name would be called also made me feel like a stalker.  Recommendation - get there early to avoid the awkward wait.  FOOD QUALITY: First thing we got on the table was garlic bread.  From my previous posts, you'll know that I love carbs/bread with a passion.  I was sorely disappointed when I took my first bite out of the garlic bread.  I was expecting warm, delicious bread - what I got was cold, oily bread.  Gross.   I thought maybe it was just an off day with the bread, but the bad didn't stop there.  If the pasta sauce that I buy at the grocery store tastes better than Trattoria, then you know there is a serious lack of skill in the way they cook pasta here.  This is especially disappointing considering it specializes in pasta and Italian food.  My group and I all ordered pasta and ALL of our pastas were undercooked.  Andrew D. ordered spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were a little bit cold? - How does that even happen??  All of our dishes were not hot.  All of us didn't want to finish our dishes, but we also didn't want to just throw away $20 per person for our dishes right down the drain.  So, we all just sucked it up and ate our subpar pasta.  SERVICE: Service was poor.  The hostess seemed a little spacey.  The waiter also took forever getting to our table to take down waters and when he dropped off our food, he was basically MIA for the rest of the time.  I had to wave down the hostess after she was done zoning out to bring us our check since our waiter went MIA on us.  I was not on my Yelp game that day and my group let me have it.  It is safe to say that I will probably not be returning to Trattoria again."}
{"text":"Went with a group.  No white wine by the glass, Fail for an Italian joint especially in vegas. Had to remind waiter twice to bring me water.  2d fail.  Then they brought my dish 5 minutes after everyone else's.   just a disappointment.   3D fail.   Eat somewhere else - so many better choices."}
{"text":"Simply fabulous dinner and service. Sat out on the patio, immediately greeted by our server Tony and he brought us a bottle of Pellegrino within a minute, with ice on the side and extra (very fresh) limes.  Ordered garlic bread, small side Caesar salad and fettuccini Alfredo. Bread was perfectly seasoned, large portion and baked to a nice golden brown. Salad was exceedingly fresh, perfect amount of dressing and just the right size for a side salad. The main course, the fettuccini Alfredo was simply the best I have ever had, and that includes comparing this dish to restaurants from all around the world. The combination of ingredients and the preparation demonstrate an exceptionally skilled chef. Likewise, the Tiramisu is not to be missed, complemented by superbly prepared cappuccino.  To top it off, the service was excellent, left a 40%+ tip - well worth it!   A restaurant not to be missed on a visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was disappointed when I came here! I came here because we wanted some food after a long night and somewhere close!  We were staying at the venetian and we also wanted something not too pricey as well!   We came here and all their dishes were around $20 or so.    I got the vodka pasta which was ok.  Nothing great.    The boyfriend got the pizza which was way too cheesy!    I don't think I'd be returning to this place in the future."}
{"text":"We all came back here again for my parents 40 year wedding anniversary.  These guys are great!! The food is superb as ever. Cooked on order and fresh. It was like eating mama's cooking at home. We love this place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the food.  The filet mignon meatballs are the best I've had and olive oil was very good.  Pasta was nice as well.  I stayed at the Wynn for a few days, and felt the food and value here was noticeably better than the wynn restaurants I frequented. That said, ambience at most wynn restaurants is hard to beat.  Mojito had room for improvement though..."}
{"text":"Service = A+. Food = A+. If you are looking for some legit Italian food that is amazing and delicious, this is the spot! The meatballs made of Filet Mignon literally melt in your mouth, and our server John was a doll with an Italian accent. The entire staff made us feel welcome and took good care of us. For an affordable and delicious meal I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First, our waiter Paulo was the best......we accidentally left a tip on the bill, not paying attention to the auto gratuity calculated. He ran out after us to let us know of the mistake.  My faith in humanity restored!! Order the shrimp scampi and chicken parm!  FANTASTIC! Atmosphere is great.....just like being in little Italy in New York. Service was prompt and professional and Paulo took care of us. Maybe Morrels in the palazzo should have Paulo come over and teach them what service is all about."}
{"text":"I think it all started out on a bad note and there wasn't a recovery during our visit.   Asking guests to wait outside until a table inside is ready (aka 108 degrees) while there is only 1 other table of 4 seated in the restaurant (should have been my first clue) is a bad start. Being pressured to order= I really hate that. It was my first time here,  I needed some time. I was also confused why the host is asking for my order minutes after we sat down? If your host is going to take orders, they should know the specials of the day! Alright, so that was an awkward start...  They bring Garlic knots that are generous and appear very appetizing. Overly greasy, soggy in olive oil, a raw garlic flavor; lighter on the oil and some nice crisp on the bread would be a big improvement.  Fella ordered the meatball sandwich (comes with fries); I went with a Caesar salad because I was already suspicious. (AKA: servers and line cooks talking about their dates last night loudly by my table in a big empty restaurant, doesn't make me feel like kitchen is strong on their game). Our food arrived so quickly I was surprised and a little suspicious (microwave?); the cheese appeared oddly coagulated, melted but not bubbly like a nice toasted meatball sam.  The salad- flavorful dressing but overdressed and I wasn't a fan of the full anchovy presented on top. Top it off- last bite was a sour tomato. Trying to eliminate that flavor from my mouth, I took some fries from my fella's dish, and sure enough the oil had a strange taste. I couldn't get the strange oil taste of my palette from these fries.   My favorite things from the experience were the fresh flowers on the table and the Andes mint that finally neutralized the weird fry oil taste."}
{"text":"Great Italian place in the Venetian! As other reviewers have said, it is a surprising little place tucked away near the food court. The service and food are really great, if on the pricey side. The garlic bread they give you to start is fantastic, but the pasta was not to be outdone. I got the chicken marsala, which came with spaghetti, and I licked the plate clean of that good good sauce. Lots of mushrooms and shallots make the dish really flavorful!  It might not be the most exciting restaurant to try in comparison to the other big-name places in Vegas, but they definitely serve some delicious classic Italian food."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant.    Sometimes what you really want is a good meal that, while decadent, has a home-made comfortable feel.  Add to the experience an intimate atmosphere (yes, it is possible to find intimate atmosphere somewhere in a hotel restaurant on the strip), a personable chef and staff, and a sense of authenticity (not post-modern authenticity, but the actual authentic kind).  We go to Vegas to do two things:  play poker and eat.  And we pack a lot of both into each trip.  It's safe to say that for all of our eating in Vegas, Trattoria Reggiano has no rival.  When you go, it might be tough to find in the maze that is the Venetian.  Head for the food court in the canal shops.  It's a few doors down from the food court seating area, but don't let that fool you.  Fake al fresco is fine, but for a nice quiet meal, see if there's a table inside.  Another online review that says it all, by \"pepprdine\" on yellowbot.com: \"The Best of las Vegas.  Trattoria Reggiano is one of those street side cafes that you think of when you are strolling down the streets in Italy. Instead of traveling to Europe you can now just visit the Venetian to find this outstanding restaurant. Excellent service, original menu and true Italian owners who care about their heritage are just a few of the reasons you should visit. Acclaimed Chef Jack Borruso is there most days and nights ensuring that every diner is satisfied. If you end oup visiting the restaurant you need to sit down with Chef Borruso and let him tell you some of his stories about cooking in Italy. You can sit there for hours listening.  You can go to those other \"trendy\" restaurants in Las Vegas and take out a second mortgage on your house to pay the bill and you might be satisfied or you can go to Trattoria Reggiano and get a taste of what a true Italian Trattoria conveys; chbefs visiting your table, authentic Italian Cuisine, smaill, intimate atmosphere and a menu that is better than most high end Italian eateries in Vegas without charging you so much that it would be cheaper to fly to Italy and dine in Rome. This is a must visit when you are in Las Vegas. \""}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I gave this place a 3 star review solely because of the food. It looked really nice inside and because of our Italian craving, we found this spot to be something new to try. The food was presented wonderfully, but the taste just doesn't match its good looks.  To be honest, this was nothing special. Their food, for the prices that they were, didn't seem to really be worth it. My pasta was mediocre, our pizza was as well.   I think the one thing that stood out was the really friendly customer service from our server for the evening. She was very attentive and accommodating. While we waited for our food she brought us out a little tray of cheeses and olives to snack on.   I don't think we'll find ourselves here again, but it wasn't a bad place. Would I recommend this to anyone else? No, because it wouldn't be the first Italian restaurant to cross my mind, BUT if someone were to ask me if they should eat there, I don't think I would try and dissuade them."}
{"text":"Simple, classic Italian cuisine. Nothing fancy as it is a corner of the Grand Canal Shops. Sangria was pretty good-- not the typical over sugar-ed type. Garlic twists were a nice break from standard pre-dining bread. Lots of variety in the menu so something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed our meal here. Ate out on the patio. The venue is is really nice. It was nice to be outside as there aren't very many good outdoor venues in Vegas. The service was good as was the food. Prices are reasonable. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delivered on the food quality.  Hard to find meandering through the canals of the shops at the Venetian!    The ambiance isn't as nice as the more expensive Italian restaurants in the area but the tasty food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were seeing the Blue man group and needed a place to dine before the show. We were in the mood for Italian and happened to stumble upon this little joint. It's rather peculiarly located-- as though it's purpose as a restaurant was an afterthought in the tiny enclave's design. It almost feels like a genuine old fashioned mom and pop-- if it weren't located in a major strip resort. It's a quaint and intimate little dining experience with all the decorations you need for a casual italian dinner.  Aesthetics aside, let me simply say that I give this place my stamp of approval. The bread is tasty, and the food arrived fairly promptly. Our waiter seemed to be an authentic Italian immigrant who had an excellent knowledge of the menu and provided valuable dining advice. My girlfriend went for the tortellini and I settled for the swordfish piccatta. The food arrived promptly and did NOT disappoint. The swordfish was succulent and the seasoning was just right-- so as not to overpower the flavor of the fish. Delicate capers draped over the fish helped me finish my portion in no time. I tried some of my girlfriends dish as well and was pleased to find that the alfredo sauce was rich and well crafted. The portions are just right to fill an average appetite and you probably won't have leftovers. For the price I paid I was quite satisfied with the quality of the food and would recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, but the restaurant charged me for my bill twice and caused lots of frustration and time spent trying to dispute it. When I called to notify rthem, they said that there was only one charge on their system and that it was a mistake by the waiter. Beyond that, I wasn't given much of a solution.  Too bad that this problem spoiled my experience with them. Check your bank statements after visiting!! Update: No resolution to the double-charge issue after a week even though I was told it would be dissolved within 3-5 days. Management was very defensive and unhelpful when I called a second time to follow up."}
{"text":"The service was very good,the server was also helpful, but there was a lobster shell in the lobster ravioli. He laughed it off and said yeah it happens a lot,not the first time,sorry. Ok, that's it?... I'm thinking well is there some kind of compensation, and are they CPR certified here, what if someone chokes, there's no warning written or verbally about eating the ravioli. Smh, anyway the lobster ravioli was the best tasting out of everything we had from here. The chicken Caesar salad was ok, the chicken had a VERY grilled smell to it, very strong, not sure why, but the chicken was also a tad bit dry. The cheese on it was yummy though, and I expected to see a smaller salad but it was meal sized. The caprese salad was just ok , the cheese was fresh and moist,the tomato was ripe,but I added a little balsamic vinegar to up the flavor . The shrimp linguini was not too bad, not as much sauce as I expected and a smaller plate than I expected but I was still satisfied and got full. They gave us soft garlic bread in the beginning while we waited for our food, it was good with and with out my dip(olive oil,balsamic vinegar and black pepper). We also had \"Italian lemonade\" lol don't even waste your time on this mess, I've seen these in the 99¢/dollar stores where I live, not just that, it's just not that good. Well in the end it's will I go back or not. Like all places we all go to, there's pros and cons to every spot, so even with the cons to this place I'd give it another shot."}
{"text":"Essay is the worst waiter I have had in Vegas. Rude and unaware of the customers needs.  Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"If you've never been here before, be prepared to take an extra 15 minutes to find this place because of how huge the Venetian is. This restaurant is in an indoor mall within the Venetian. Though it's indoors with a controlled climate, most of the seating is still \"outside\" of the restaurant on the patio, so you might have a bunch of random people and kids and strollers walk right past your table. If you don't mind that, the food is great and the staff is kind and attentive.  I went with my friend and her mom, dad, brother, sister, sister's husband and their baby girl. The menu is big but not too large, but big enough to make it hard to decide because at least two things sound awfully good. I teetered between gnocchi in pesto cream sauce and lobster ravioli. I absolutely love ravioli and thick, chewy pastas. I went with the lobster ravioli. The texture of the ravioli pasta was just right, and the filling was a mixture of cheese and lobster. I forget what was in the pink sauce, it was tomato and a bit creamy or buttery and I think they put some shrimp on it as well. My friend enjoyed her very cheesy rigatoni, her sister's gnocchi in pesto looked amazing and I wished I had ordered it, her husband got the same thing I did and ate it all up, her mother I think got the eggplant parmesan but don't quote me on that... I believe it was gooey and flavorful and cooked to her liking. My friend's brother ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and of course that was done very well with al dente pasta and a good sauce. The meatballs are very large and a bit more delicate than they seem from looking at them. I accidentally dropped half a meatball someone had ordered on the side into my water glass due to underestimating the strength of the meatball in relation to my fork. The waiter smiled and just brought out another big meatball in sauce free of charge. I believe everyone was satisfied with their meal. I I didn't end up finishing my ravioli however, but it's my fault because I ordered something too fishy for my tastes. On occasion a bite of the lobster ravioli was too strong and lobstery for me. Don't ask me why, I'm picky and mild with my seafood flavors. The shrimp were fine. Ultimately I had hoped they had my favorite on the menu, mushroom ravioli. I order those everywhere I see them, they always have such a rich nutty taste and they mix so well with cheese and make a great filling! I think that's the reason I ordered the lobster ravioli... I really craved mushroom ravioli. Anyway, I think I should have gotten the pesto gnocchi, that looked INCREDIBLE! I bet it was. If I ever go back I'll try that."}
{"text":"We went to Vegas to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary.  While purchasing tickets at one of the discount ticket booths on the trip for a couple of shows, we were offered a discount at this restaurant.  We walked to Ceasars (granted it was mid August, so we were in shorts and sweaty) to go to dinner and didn't have time to change clothes. When we arrived at Trattoria Reggiano, we were graciously greeted by the host.  While the host was grabbing menus for us, a server walked up to the host stand and rudely rolled his eyes at us and then he whispered something to the host.  Luckily we didn't get that rude server's section.  We were served by Paolo.  He was EXCELLENT.  Gave great suggestions, didn't snarl his nose up at the fact that we had a discount dinner ticket and treated us with respect (even though we were casually dressed).  He made our dining experience pleasant.  The reason I left off a star was because I asked for a specific pasta (penne) but I got something totally different (fettucine) but Paolo graciously apologized.  I will go back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you.. this is one of the best Italian restaurants you will dine at.  Everything about this place is great... the food. The service, the ambiance.  I ordered the lobster ravioli and it was incredible. Large raviolis with an awesome sauce and a very generous portion of lobster. We also had the red sangria and it is very very good.  If you are looking for Italian on the strip then come here.  UPDatE. The dessert tray is awesome.  We had the carrot cake which was very moist and exceptional."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars. I wasn't impressed but I wasn't really disappointed. It's closer to A OK, but I've definitely had better. Everything was just alright. It tries hard but falls short. They do offer complimentary garlic bread and an antipasto plate. The cheese on the plate was not good at all. The olives were eh, and the canned roasted peppers were just that....canned...or jarred..whatever. Not fresh made. So, as much as I enjoy free stuff, I like free stuff thats good. I'd pass on the antipasto next time. There were 8 of us so we tried a bunch of stuff. I really enjoyed the eggplant rolatini, that was so good. The calmari were OK, but I didn't think the meatballs were great the way people raved about them. I ordered the fruit de mare pasta dish. It was alright. I'd try something else next time if I decided to come back. We had a couple of bottles of the sangria (half price during happy hour), and we enjoyed that.  I'm a HUGE fan of eggplant rolatini, and theirs was good, so if I did come back, it would be for that. Service was alright. Cost was what you'd expect for Summerlin. Oh, be mindful of prices. They differ from menu to menu."}
{"text":"Nice little place to sit with wine, bread, and  good Italian food. Salad and the meatballs alone are enough.  Delicious."}
{"text":"The best thing you might eat here are the garlic knots. I think I came close to eating two baskets worth all by myself. I didn't care if I wreaked of garlic or that I'd be sweating it out of my pores the next day, they were pretty damn good. As for the rest of the stuff I tried... meh. The menu is typical Italian-American food, the kind of stuff you'll see in a million other spots. Perfect for the non-adventurous eater -- the kind of diner who thinks not eating at a national chain is a bit risky.   The kitchen plays it safe and turns out unremarkable food. Meatballs ($14) made from a filet mignon and pork loin mixture were too hard and dense with a sauce that lacked depth. The small portion of the kale peanut salad ($8) was plenty to share, but the underdressed dish had me reaching for water to wash it down. The end of the meal took a turn for the better with a satisfying, but uninspired, lasagna ($22) with ground filet, ricotta, and mozzarella.  Kid menus are available as well. My son's spaghetti (ordered sans tomato sauce, just butter) was a sizable portion that he devoured. Each kid's meal comes with a beverage and mini cannoli.  Located steps away from the movie theater in Downtown Summerlin, it's a nice looking space with a large patio and a smaller than expected interior, with a bar and open kitchen. The food is more paint-by-numbers than Monet, but is just good enough to satisfy a suburban customer base used to eating recognizable Italian.  2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"The truth is we went there because I bought my self a %50 discount coupons from tix4onight. But oh boy, the pasta is the finest I had in Vegas. You can have better pasta at Mario Batali's rest but for quadruple the price.  The vodka pink sauce is amazing. The tortellini with cheese is amazing too. We also had veal Milanese and it was good.  I would come back anytime if I crave pasta."}
{"text":"This place has been really busy every time I passed by this week because of conventions. I finally put my name down on a wait list for a table and the hostess gabrielle was very nice when telling me the wait was 30 mins. So she took my phone number and sent texts about our table availability. While waiting I was inquiring about the menu and the manager Dora and the hostess knew a lot about this place, only making me more excited to eat here. The table was finally available the hostess kindly showed me to the table. I promptly got my order taken and soon after the delicious garlic knots arrived. Then a little later my tortelloni came and I was offered fresh Parmesan to top it off. The overall service was great I hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"was hard to find, but so worth it ! food was delish and the service was wonderful. loved the experience."}
{"text":"Long time Las Vegas resident (over 33 years) and must say this is a wonderful place. Great food, terrific ambiance and service. Never had a disappointing meal from pizza's to spaghetti and meatballs, seafood, and more. Great bread, olives and peppers to kick things off.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great food. Great atmosphere. Do not go there without trying the meatballs, they are fabulous!  Oh, and the service there was the best."}
{"text":"small restaurant, no reservations inside the venetian shopping area. waited about 15 mins and were seated and served fresh bread with balsamic and oil. ordered some pasta and it was delicious! so delicious i ate the whole thing hahaha"}
{"text":"Dinner. Table for 4.  This was some of the best Italian food and service I've ever had! It felt like a mom and pop hole in the wall Italian restaurant run by a tightly knit family. Loved all the old black and white pictures on the walls. Made me feel like I was having dinner in someone's house.  Tried the Eggplant Parmigiana and tasted my friend's Tortilloni.  Both were absolutely delicious! Every bite was just as good as the last. The filet mignon meatballs were tender and full of flavor as well. The garlic knots were too good - unfortunately we filled up on the garlic knots that we couldn't finish our main course.   So worth the stop if ever at the Venetian."}
{"text":"Great little place in the Venetian.  Our meal was a little expensive, but the service was great and the food was great.  I would recommend this place if you are looking for some good Italian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas to ring in the New Year and we wanted to get some dinner. My parents decided to let my brother choose the food that night and he wanted to eat Italian. After looking up some places, he chose this one, and I am extremely thankful that he did.  Looking at the menu, I immediately freaked out because of the pricing (double what I usually pay for). However, I decided to roll with it, as we don't splurge that often, and it was Vegas, after all.  What we ordered:  Starters: Filet Mignon Meatballs ($12): These were absolutely amazing! It comes with three plump meatballs, much bigger than we were expecting, with a delicious tomato-y pomodoro sauce and some spaghetti. We wished we ordered it from the Pasta menu, but maybe next time?  Pasta Specialties: Gnocchi al Pesto ($18): Soft ricotta dumplings with a creamy pesto sauce in a large plate that I simply could not finish! These are a meal on their own, and in my case I had leftovers. These cheesy dumplings should not be underestimated, as they do fill you up!  Individual Brick Oven Pizza: Primavera ($16): A light vegetarian pizza loaded with flavors. I have had a pizza with similar toppings, and that pizza absolutely pales in comparison. This pizza was not very greasy and seemed to be quite authentic.  Drinks: Cappuccino ($6.5): The most expensive cappuccino I have ever had, but one that I will never regret ordering. After having that cappuccino, I have craved it many times over. The drink comes in a small cup with a small piece of biscotti on the side and a small stick of rock sugar. It was the perfect cup of cappuccino in my opinion.  My family (4 including me) shared these dishes and we had leftover pizza and gnocchi, which we (I) later on devoured at our hotel room. The service was great, with our server giving us time to eat and periodically refilling our water glasses. I was surprised that he didn't come by to check on our food as often as people usually do, but it was a nice change, and I'm guessing more authentically Italian? Anyways, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Our service was great and the food was good but I feel like it was a little over priced.  Maybe it is because Trattoria is in downtown summerlin but $18 for a salad seems excessive to me. We ordered the Kale salad, a margherita pizza and a cannoli. The garlic knots served before hand were amazing! I could have eaten a whole basket of those and left content. They were warm, fresh and smeared with butter and garlic. Carb heaven.   Our server was great and split the salad for us so we each had a good portioned amount and the pizza came out perfectly with a chewy crust and a little char on it from the brick oven. They use authentic Italian tomato sauce here and the flavors and unmatched. The cannoli was authentic and perfectly sweet and a nice finish to the meal.    I forsee enjoying the patio here when it isn't oven temperatures outside and I would like to come back to try a happy hour here as well. I appreciated how well our server took care of us."}
{"text":"Came here after 5 years. The place has gone bigger. It was small nice corner before. Now its full blown restaurant. Great service and great food. Our favorite in Vegas."}
{"text":"The Hubby and I went to get him his alfredo fix on his birthday.  We noticed everyone was sitting outside once we walked up and asked for a table inside... It worked out nice because we were the only ones inside and it felt like we had the place to ourselves :) I ordred the carbonara and the Hubby ordered the alfredo.  Our meals came out fast.  They loaded my pasta up with bacon, it was yummy.  The sauce very thick and creamy, different that what I am use to, but it was good.  The Hubby LOVED his alfredo.  I didn't love the garlic knots, but dipped in some balsamic it was good.  They seemed to be over steamed so they got hard and dry.  Overall, we were happy."}
{"text":"Loved this little hole in the wall restaurant! It's tucked away in a corner of the grand canal shops on the Venetian side. It's a family run business and authentic Italian as they're actually from Italy, including the wait staff. They made great recommendations and we loved all of them! I ordered the linguine fruti de mare (clams, calamari, and shrimp in a spicy marinara) while my mom orders linguine in clam sauce and my aunt ordered the swordfish piccata style with steamed vegetables. I loved my dish and I usually don't like red sauces. I also loved the swordfish, the piccata was so flavorful and perfectly cooked! The garlic knots were also really great, which came free! We ended up ordering the tiramisu for dessert even though my aunt was hesitant because the example looked really creamy. It was really creamy, but surprised us in how delicious it was! It was a light cream and my aunt was glad we ended up ordering it! I was happy to hear that they would be expanding because they deserve to be seen! Great service and food and decent prices for Vegas!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Everything from service, food, drinks and  atmosphere is excellent. I don't love everything on the menu but we LOVE the meatballs, soups, several pasta dishes, caprese salad and the pizza is excellent!! Tiramisu is fresh, homemade and unlike all other restaurants. The indoor/outdoor restaurant always feels cozy. We love the patio but when it's chilly we like inside just as much. Saturday night with live music is fun and relaxing for date night. We've even run into a few famous folks here while enjoying the live, old school (rat pack type) of music. Great for people watching too:)  We've been many times, and I failed to write a review sooner. However, after visiting another Italian place also in DTS that left us regretting our need to try something new,  I felt compelled to write this review before I forget again."}
{"text":"I had the Stromboli and a slice of pie. The pizza was good! The service could you some work, but they did the basic job. I did have a couple flies flying around the place when I was inside so they need a door fan or something like that. Good prices for its location in downtown Summerlin! I would come back!"}
{"text":"This was a great decision in an area with so many options. Fine dining Italian at it's very best with a beautiful decor.   We didn't have a reservation on a Friday early evening and we were quickly accommodated on the patio which has heaters. We shared a few dishes including the fantastic meatball app, some of the best ever! Gnocchi with pesto was perfect, finished with fresh roasted pine nuts and the pinot noir matched nicely the dishes we selected.   Service is top notch and the staff works as a team. Our server was right on, checked on us and knew when to leave us to enjoy. She was awesome! I'm very picky with Italian, this was the best we've had in the area. We had a very delicious and comfortable experience and we'll be back soon. Highly recommended!! 5 star all the way!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant in downtown summerlin!! Love the open atmosphere enjoying dinner and looking out at the shops. The food is 5 star Italian with great dishes, favorites are chicken parmigiana, pesto gnocchi, and old fashioned spaghetti and meatballs. Bethany at the bar is an amazing server and will keep you entertained with great conversation and good company. This is my favorite spot for dinner go check it out for yourselves!!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the good reviews. A little hard to find it is deep within the Venetian Grand Canal Shop area. The staff was really friendly and we had an awesome waiter! He was very attentive and accommodating to my pickiness. I ordered the Gnoochi with meat sauce and it was awesome! The wine list was a little pricey (nothing under $50) but at least it was good! I will definitely be retuning next time I am in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. Great for dinner before a movie. Pizza was amazing. Service exceptional.  Love meeting friends on the patio during spring and fall."}
{"text":"A great, affordable option for Italian-American fare in Vegas. The staff are friendly and service is fast. The boyfriend and I went twice during our stay and enjoyed our dishes so much that we got the same things both times: spaghetti and meatballs for him, eggplant parmesan for me. The second time we went, we also started with the baked clams special, which was delicious."}
{"text":"My best friend and I were doing a lot of running around and needed to grab a quick lunch so we came here. We heard they were great for the meatballs and garlic bread.   The garlic bread was in the shape of a knot and they where huge and very garlicky. They tasted really good but  a bit too much garlic.   The meatballs honestly weren't the greatest and they where overly used with garlic!  The pizza was just a normal brick oven pizza nothing special at all.   A little while latter man was I sick. I think it's way too much garlic used in the food. My friend and I were vomiting from the food. It was so bad."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely scrumptious! My family was aching in the hot Vegas heat and was craving I nice filling Italian meal. Luckily, we stopped right by this nice little restaurant and all our needs were fulfilled.   We began the meal with some delicious garlic bread with olive oil and vinegar. For our entrees I ordered a kale salad while my wife ordered baked clams, my son ordered baked ziti with meatballs, and my daughter- spaghetti bolognese.  My kale salad wasn't extraordinary but exactly as I expected: healthy. very healthy. My children on the other hand had delicious plates of cheesy, meaty, pasta goodness. I highly recommend the pastas. My wife's clams were also delicious with the bread crumb and cheese toppings.   The service was great. The waiter was very polite and the food came very quick. An overall great experience and delicious meal. 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Very small tucked away in the Venetian shoppes area, this place was a good find for us. We ordered three dishes for four people, but was more than enough for us. Garlic pasta - simple, seasoned, and delicious! Clam linguini - i am allergic to shell fish but my party LOVED it. And margherita pizza was crispy, thin, and simple.  If anyone is looking for simple italian but don't want to deal with the vegas wait or publicity, check this place out."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Vegas, enjoying the sights, when we decided to try out this restaurant for dinner. We were dressed casually in t-shirts and jeans. We did not have a reservation, but the hostess was friendly and told us it was a 30 minute wait. We put our name down and we waited maybe ten minutes tops before she texted that our table was ready. We were sat and our waiter came over. We explained that we were still pretty full from all the good food of Vegas, but that we wanted to split the chicken parmesean. We chose to not get anything else, and to drink we had water. The waiter took our order, and then he spent the rest of the night giving fantastic service to the table next to ours, while ignoring us completely. A couple of helpful bus boys brought out our garlic rolls, and then later our waters. The female manager brought out our meals which they had split for us, and she grated fresh cheese onto our plates. The food was delicious, and fresh. We loved every bite. We finished our meals entirely and the bus boys cleared out plates and still our waiter had never checked on us. He arrived to ask us if we wanted dessert and then gave us the check. We paid with cash and left. The two stars is for the great food and the little bit of good service we did receive, but clearly if you get the wrong waiter and you are not dressed to impress, and buying tons of food, do not expect to get good service at all. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Omg!! Wow!! Those bread knots are awesome!  Excellent ambiance and great service... had a delicious large Cesar shared w my parents and we shared two pizzas... lovely... enough said.  Check it out and don't forget their Long Island... washes down perfectly w those bread knots!!! Bam!!!"}
{"text":"I made reservations online via open table and I get there and they would not honor it.  As I was talking to the manager and I showed him that there were reservation availability for not only my seating at 8:15 but for 8:30, 8:45 and 9:00 he proceeded to tell me the wait is an hour because he has a waiting list.  You guys need to get your act together or stop using open table as an option for your customers. #palazzolasvegas #venetianlasvegas #fail"}
{"text":"The first place we ate at in Las Vegas. The service was wonderful. We were 20 minutes late and they understood and still seated us. Our waiter was very attentive. We ordered two house glasses of wine which were great. The food we ordered was penne al pesto and whole wheat penne w/ shrimp and marinara. Those are not on the menu and they did not hesitate to change things up for us. The food was amazing. The pesto tasted absolutely homemade. The shrimps were fresh and the marinara sauce tasted authentic. Finally, the whole wheat pasta was cooked perfectly. It was not hard and it did not make me wish I ordered white pasta. Thank you!"}
{"text":"REALLY enjoyed our meal here last Friday.  We were seated quickly and served promptly.  Our waiter was super nice and attentive.  The food was really delicious.  We had chicken parm and baked ziti with meatballs.  I love every bite of it.  Would absolutely come here again and recommend without hesitation."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor - and when in Vegas - dine here. So many places to choose from but everything is so overrated. This, THIS place gets it. The service is impeccable and the dishes even more so. Be sure to enjoy and Aperol Spritz before your meal."}
{"text":"If this isn't \"real\" Italian food I don't ever want to try \"real\" Italian. I went twice on this trip to Vegas. Both times we had the Caprese as a starter - I've never had such good mozzarella. For entrees, I had the spaghetti and meatballs and chicken parmigiana, both of which were delicious.   If you're looking for a quick, delicious bite on the North part of the Strip you have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good small Italian restaurant that's affordable. I wanted to try this place because everyone said this place was good and this place didn't disappoint. The sausage pizza tasted good and wasn't too heavy. The pastas also tasted very good. Steamed mussels were also fantastic. Only minor negative was that this restaurant is really small and I can definitely see this place packed during a busy weekend. I'll definitely try this place again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Very kind and thoughtful waiters. The lasagna is the best in town. If you're coming for lunch, it's not on the menu. Ask for it, and they'll take care of you! Also, the chocolate chip cannoli will literally and figuratively save your life."}
{"text":"Not only good location great environment friendly staffed and the food excellent , one of the best Italian places I've eaten not only in Vegas but I'm glad they got this one in downtown Summerlin closer to my home. Definitely another one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Just so good. We hadn't been to Vegas in a while he the last time we stumble upon this place when it was one third the size restaurant that it is now. It was absolutely incredible back then. The best kind of surprise. So when we went this time it was intentional. And our expecttTions were really high. AMAZING AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food.  Had the pasta and clams and it was very good but at the high price paid I would have expected it to be a bit better.  Caesar salad was delicious but the croutons could crack a tooth!"}
{"text":"Just the best food and dinner experience of our 5 day stay in Vegas. Like another Yelper, we were a bit skeptical given that it is a very small restaurant tucked by the side of the food court - so we actually checked it out the night before. We were not disappointed in the least. Sat inside (only a little claustrophobic but not bad), hubby had veal parmigiana (the biggest piece of veal ever and absolutely delicious), I had the shrimp scampi and we shared a caesar salad - no room for dessert but would have liked to have tried one of the many choices and John was attentive and had a sense of humor (hard to find in most of the stuffy Vegas restaurants).  If you like authentic Italian food and atmosphere, you will like Trattoria Reggiano. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Watch out! Our boss took 8 of us to dinner tonight. I was very much looking forward to eat a juicy steak. For $40 they gave me a salt meat!! It was so salty I had to force it down my throat and drink with each bite!! As my boss was paying for it and I was with my colleagues I did not say anything I just eat it all and stayed quiet . I told the waiter Keith who was nice but I am not sure if he let the manager or the cook know about the salty steak!  Just because they are in Summerlin in Vegas and charge $40 for a price of steak that does not guarantee a good quality food. Such a shame !!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian experience ever! The closest you can get to Italy without actually visiting the country. PAOLO will take care of you and your guests. Try the ricotta lemon cheesecake and Italian coffee."}
{"text":"Trattoria Reggiano has been on my list for awhile, and it was fantastic.   Tucked away and tightly run, this restaurant understands how to move people right through their meal, which I think is great. I was coming off a cold and wanted nothing more than the homecooked feel of spaghetti and meatballs, which I had with the house chianti and the famous house garlic knots.   Best spaghetti and meatballs ever. The sauce was impeccable, balanced but distinct flavor, and light enough not to stop your stomach a few bites in. Pasta was just as perfect - you know you've had a good meal when you remember how much you enjoyed the experience of simply eating it. I'm not usually capable of putting a lot away, but I finished the entire plate, and got a congratulatory, \"Good job, boss\" from my cameriere. Much better than the chiding he gave the Italian sitting next to me, who was apparently letting his pizza get too cold while texting.  The bill was on my table in a flash, the real boss told a waiting guest \"This table will be ready in 30 seconds,\" and I was on my way. Grazie!"}
{"text":"After dining at the very average Canaletto, we decided to give this place a try.  It always looked packed and crammed, which is unappealing but we just had to try it for all the reviews.   Why not 5 stars? The seating, although cute, is kind of invasive and too close for comfort.  We were seated next to a couple that was arguing \"quietly\" and I heard everything...awkward. Also, what's up with these bottled soft drinks? Major AUGH for no refills.  The service was pretty great! Servers were attentive and friendly.  How could they maneuver amongst such a small space?!   I ordered the Shrimp Scampi with a side of Grilled Chicken Breast. I LOVE that you can add chicken breast to ANY menu item! More protein to counteract the pasta carbs, please!  My food was so damn delicious! Sorry for the damn, but damn! The pasta was so al dente and flavorful! The shrimp was BAM! And the chicken was DOUBLE BAM!  My boyfriend had the Chicken Marsala and he liked it a lot! No, he did not love it but at Regianno's defense, Marsala isn't that flavorful in any place and my bf was kinda drunk lol  I think we'll come back! Can't wait to try those filet mignon meatballs!"}
{"text":"Last year when I was in Vegas for a tradeshow my coworker suggest going here for dinner since the steakhouse we originally want to eat at had a 2 hour wait. Oh boy am I glad we did. The food was phenomenal, it was probably one of the best meals I had during the trips. Even better than those steakhouses that we spent $75 for a piece of steak.   Garlic rolls: Hot, soft and garlicy, it was pretty amazing. It was so hard not wanting to eat it all but I had to control myself since I wanted to save room in my stomach for the other dishes  Meat and cheese platter: Huge platter! So much meat and cheese!  We shared it between three people and still had a lot of left overs  Linguine with clam in white sauce: Typically I am not a white sauce kind of person but this pasta dish was too good not eat. The sauce was light and the clams were fresh. They were really generous with the clams too. I totally recommend this!  Veal parmigiana: My coworker ordered this dish and she kept raving how tender and delicious it was.  Calamari: Fried to perfection and the portion was huge.  Lobster ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce: Sooooooooo good. There was chunks of lobsters in every bite.  Tiramisu: Hands down the BEST tiramisu I have ever had, ever. I am not a tiramisu person whatsoever but this tiramisu was beyond amazing.  Overall, this place took me by surprise. Yes, I would go here again and yes, I recommend that you check this place out."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Also, the patio is a really nice spot to relax and have a drink!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I live in SF and visit a few times a year in Las Vegas by business and private. I have always lunch and dinner there. The staff are very friendly and their past are perfect!! Recently, they did expand the restaurant and began to take a reservation! I will be there soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant was beautiful with a quaint feel. But what I appreciated was our server.  When I told her we were vegetarians she said, \"ok, I can make a special dish for you. What kind of pasta do you like?\" That was such a kind gesture. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the romantic open air. And when the food came it was perfection!"}
{"text":"This place is good, but definitely not what it used to be. Before I lived in Vegas I used to visit this place a lot about 3 years ago. During shot show this year I took a friend here because I remember it being so good and I rarely visit the strip now that I live here. The positive thing about going back is that they have expanded the physical restaurant and so it was much easier to get a seat. It just didn't feel the same however. I always loved the 2 Italian men that would serve us and they were nowhere to be seen. Maybe it's just me, but I kind of miss the ambience that used to be there. The food is still nice but I probably wouldn't drive out of my way anymore to go here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local spots to go to. Ricki the server and manager Dan are the most welcoming and dynamic team. I love their meatballs and they have the BEST Italian kale salad that is simply a must try!!! The service is always incredible and I can count on a yummy meal and delicious wine. It's definitely a great place to hang out for happy hour or enjoy a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic and the waitress was phenomenal in fact, she's the reason I didn't walk out. I ordered the chicken parmigiana (fantastic!) but it needed some spice, so I asked for the only hot sauce, Tabasco. They brought it to me in a [insert profanity of choice] cup! They were happy to give me a bottle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil but not Tabasco. As a Louisianan, I find that insulting and inexcusable. Tabasco must be spread with the original nozzle, not a [add profanity] cup. There's more traditional in that bottle than anything else in that restaurant. Fix or I shall not be a frequent guest."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and they continue to impress! With the customer service being top notch, and the bartender ( I think her name is Bethany) the food, atmosphere, and all the people are very friendly! The food is delicious and my fave is the lasagna!!! You cannot go wrong in here!"}
{"text":"Used to be five stars!! We have been here many times over the years. Our family dines here about once a month. We know all of the long time staff and they have always been impeccable. The food is delicious and consistent.  Each family member has their favorite dish.  I am confused though because although the staff is still perfect the restaurant  has been downgraded. The last 2 times we have been there our mineral water was served in plastic cups. We ordered wine and got one glass. When we asked for another glass the wait staff was very apologetic and almost seemed embarrassed. They brought a glass that wasn't a red wine glass. We ended  up with 3 different glasses for 3 people. Buy some wine glasses.  This is a  restaurant ??   I felt like I brought a bottle of wine to my teetotaler Grandma's house drinking it out of juice glasses. Then the kids went to a Kool Aid stand and brought me a glass of mineral water in a Dixie cup."}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant based on other reviews but disappointed with my Pesto gnocchi. I ordered it to -go.  Though the sauce was very light and creamy, the gnocchi tasted like it came from a package you buy at the store. I make my own soft fluffy pillow gnocchi at home,  and these tasted pre-bought not freshly made. It should've had pine nuts and parmesan, but it didn't have any. Was also hoping for bread with it but didn't receive any, nor did I get a fork to eat with.  For $18+ I expected: freshly made pasta and more on my plate. I will be heading to the food court soon for another snack.  Side note:  the servers were coming back with empty plates so maybe I ordered the wrong dish."}
{"text":"LOVED this place located inside the Shoppes at the Venetian!   Very busy joint which speaks volumes for the food.   Had an \"authentic\" italian waiter, accent and all (either that or a very good actor)...white tableclothes....shared two pasta dishes and a bottle of chianti which the waiter kept pouring for us.    Dined \"Af Fresco\" and had an additional guest, a pigeon that kept walking back and forth past our table which added cute ambiance.   Would def call this a \"date\" place."}
{"text":"While I have always loved this restaurant, my last experience was a little underwhelming. I went to dinner there with a friend, and the service was not great. Our waiter was very nice and friendly  but seemed overwhelmed.  I actually had to ask for a drink refill twice as he never offered. At the end of the meal, he asked if we wanted  boxes for our leftovers, to which we agreed, then left, came back a second time and asked us again. The cherry on the cake was when a skinny, blonde hostess (who sounded also a little scattered)  inquired if I was someone's mother (who happens to be only 9 years younger than I. Clearly she did not get the memo that you never guess or assume a person's age. Not impressed and not sure I will be going back."}
{"text":"Pricey Italian restaurant tucked away by Coffee Bean in the Venetian. Interior is pretty basic, with wall of wine. We thought the restaurant would be more romantic. This location is more quaint with a mom and pop feel maybe? Half the seating area is also outside where people are wandering through the Venetian.  Nothing was terrible, but for the price and 4-star Yelp rating I expected better.  Garlic Bread: I hyped this up a lot in my head, but the bread was, well, bread. Not super garlic-y as I'd hoped, but very soft for sure. Spaghetti and Meatballs: the filet mignon meatballs were nothing special. Spaghetti sauce was a little on the sour side. Nothing out of the ordinary. Linguine in Clam Sauce: lots of clams, which were delish! Linguine was good, pretty standard.  I most likely will not go back, however the service was excellent! Several of the waiters were sweet older gentlemen who were so kind and cheery. One extra star for being so hospitable!"}
{"text":"super cute little spot hidden in the venetian canal shoppes. only decided to check it out because of good reviews on yelp. my friend and i came here for dinner on a monday night. we were seated right away. service was good. the food was decently priced considering everything is so expensive in vegas. good portions too. the garlic bread they serve was yummy but a bit too greasy. it tastes great dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar though. i ordered the linguine with shrimp, my friend ordered the linguine carbonara. based on all the comments about how good the meatballs were, we decided to get those as an appetizer. definitely a good call on the meatballs. =) the pastas were both good. nothing spectacular with either dish. the carbonara was a bit heavy since it had a white sauce. we were way too stuffed to get any dessert."}
{"text":"I am a little baffled by all the 4-5 star reviews for this place. It's a tiny (really tiny) restaurant by the food court in the Grand Canal shops. The service was okay but not great. Someone in our party ordered a pizza with chicken and the waiter forgot to add chicken, then brought us a side of chicken after they were finished eating the pizza. Plus the pizza wasn't very good (the 90 second pizza place in the food court was better). I ordered a pasta and wasn't very impressed either. It wasn't bad but wasn't anything special. After eating (keep in mind I split a plate) my stomach felt terrible as well.    Overall I would suggest looking for a different Italian place. I'm sure there's other Italian places here with a lot better food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food and service. I had spaghetti and meatballs and others had ziti. Two kids (3 and 19 months - and the mess associated with them but the staff was great about that) shared ravioli off the kids menu. We dined outside in pleasant weather. Pricing is spot on for what you get. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was really good. The individual pizza can easily feed two. The thing to know is this is located one second floor in the food court. Not much ambience."}
{"text":"We went there because it has such good reviews on yelp, but the reality was the opposite.  We had calamari as appetizer, we waited too long and we noticed the other table came and ordered their meal after us actually got their calamari around 10 - 15 mins earlier than us. By the time we got our calamari, it was another big disappointment, it tasted like it was sitting there for a while, it was just warm and not crispy, passes the best timing. We had pizza and pasta, the pizza also passed its best timing like our calamari, just warm....they didn't bring it to our table right after it was ready. We are pretty sure it was sitting on their kitchen counter for at least 5-10 mins.  We kind of pointed our concerns to our waiter, we asked him why other tables came after us actually got their meals earlier than us, and he just gave us some ridiculous excuse saying it was the kitchen, he doesn't have any control of it. I don't know if it's just our bad luck or maybe because we were the only Asian there. Other tables seem being taken care of nicely. Well, maybe I'm over thinking about this, but just saying, if u are Asian, do yourself a favor, go somewhere else. They don't really care, especially if you are not their own people."}
{"text":"We came here after getting a coupon for 50% off of our main dishes. I ordered the pesto gnocchi and my date ordered the chicken francese. If it weren't for the coupon I wouldn't come back here, $26 for a piece of average chicken and a small side of spaghetti! The best part of the meal wasthe complimentary garlic bread rolls they give you, can I just order a side of those to go?"}
{"text":"Pretty satisfied with this restaurant. I normally don't venture out to Summerlin, but a group of my friends wanted to meet up since it had been a while since we all saw each other. Although it was warm outside, we sat in the outer dinning area and felt fine. The fans kept us really cool and we were shielded from the sun. Every table gets free bread and a plate of olives, cheese and other little vegetables. I ordered the pesto gnocchi which was just okay. I'm allergic to dairy so it is often hard to find a good meal without cheese in it at Italian restaurants. I think next time I will try the spaghetti and meatballs.   The prices are definitely high, so it's more of a place to celebrate a special occasion. Our waitress was super nice and patient with us. I would definitely go back for a date night"}
{"text":"Best Italian style food. If you are around venetian then don't miss this place with nice environment and delicious foods. Our waiter was an middle aged man who was truly kind and polite. I'm happy that my friend told us to go there and enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband, granddaughter an I came here for lunch an let me say it was great. Loved the gact you can sit inside or outside. From the moment you walk in the place you know your going to have great food an Excellent service. I had the grilled chicken Cesare salad which was oh the hook. The flavor of the chicken was very good an cooked perfectly.  My husband had the Philly cheese  steak minus peppers an mushrooms an it was also good. An my he spaghetti our granddaughter had was good as well. The garlic knots omg...yummmm...The manager checked every order before it went out to make sure everything was perfect. Our server checked backed often to make sure we were ok as well as the manager. We will definitely be going back. All the food even the pizza looked amazing. Can't wait to try it all."}
{"text":"I will come here every time I'm in Vegas! I think it's probably the best italian food I've had! The staff is always so wonderful and accommodating; this is how all restaurants should be. My family went for my sister's birthday lunch and upon hearing this, our server brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake with a candle in it at the end of our meal.   Since we were all going to an early dinner later that day, everyone in our group decided to share a pasta dish with another person. Instead of bringing out an extra plate with each dish, the kitchen had perfectly portioned out half of each pasta for us.   This time around I ordered the linguine bolognese. I think this is my second favorite dish after the carbonara. You can't go wrong here. I think everything will be good."}
{"text":"I simply love this place. Like every review you have probably read about the place don't judge it by its location. Of all the restaurants in the shoppes this one is kind of hidden away but the food and the service is terrific. It has an old Italian restaurant feel. It judging by what happened from my last visit I owe them a great review. For starters the bread rolls are excellent they give you a lot and they oil and vinegar is kept at the table so you can add more to your plate whenever you want. Like every Italian restaurant I go I got the calamari. I can tell you that it taste terrific and they give you a huge portion. I was almost full from eating the appetizer with my wife. I got the Italian sangria to drink a very different but welcomed taste from other dark sangrias I'm used to. For dinner I had a Frutti Di Mare here they use bucatini noodles instead of the thinner linguini most restaurants do. It was excellent and is loaded with clams and mussels. Now to my wife's meal she had a moscato to drink and ordered something off menu a swordfish in piccata sauce. My wife doesn't like seafood at all but wanted something different. Of course she didn't like it but I had to do my due diligence and taste it and as far as fish dishes go I thought it was delicious the swordfish really sucks up all the piccata sauce making it very flavorful. My wife stated that she did not care for the meal and the excellent waiter ( what's up Victor) replaced it with a filet mignon which was cooked to perfection with potatoes and veggies in a pool of a sauce I can't describe but it was amazing. If anyone who works there reads this review to me explain that sauce to me. Tl:Dr Great restaurants"}
{"text":"Yum!! I love trying new Italian places because I feel like every restaurant has something unique about it! Really enjoyed our dinner here. We ordered quiet a few things. My daughter had the chicken parmesan, I had the chicken Alfredo, and my husband had the shrimp pasta with linguine. My kids ordered pizza and we also had the calamari. I loved the chicken, it was tender and the alfredo sauce was perfect! My husbands linguine and shrimp was absolutely phenomenal!!! I thought everything was delicious!  Service was good but, I felt like we could have been waited on faster. It took a little while. They were very polite and apologetic. Will definitely visit again! It is definitely something you have to try at least once."}
{"text":"This was a real treat hidden deep in the Venetian. The spaghetti with tenderloin meat in the sauce was really fantastic. A great alternative to a buffet."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner last week.  We started with the meatballs for our appetizer and knew we were going to love this place. We enjoyed people watching the spaghetti and baked ziti.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to our waiter forgetting my soda.  The food was so good that I didn't point this out when the bill came."}
{"text":"Spending Labor Day weekend at the Venetian and saw the great reviews so we decided to have dinner here. I had the Italian Sangria for my cocktail and it was delicious. Lyndsay was our server and she did a fantastic job explaining the menu. We have been to many restaurants and the bread was the most moist and tastiest we ever had. The starter meat balls lived up to all the other reviewers comments  so it was well worth the money. My wife and I decided to share the Lobster Ravioli as she wanted to have room leftover for dessert. As it turned out we were stuffed and couldn't eat another bite. Everything here was fresh and tasty so we highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant not in a restaurant area of the Venetian. Good food. Service was almost too fast, mainly due to the small size. Cozy."}
{"text":"After an hot Vegas afternoon of shopping my friend and I decided to stop for a salad and glass of wine.....so glad we passed on our original stop and tried something new.  We were promptly seated and waited on.  We ordered the peanut kale and caesar salad (added shrimp) and split a carafe of red sangria.  Everything was very fresh and well presented.  We really enjoyed the complimentary garlic knots.  Will be bringing more guests more often."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance! Makes me feel like I'm in a family kitchen. The food was good. Nothing spectacular, but I wasn't disappointed. Drinks were strong, but you paid for that.  The only real issue was that we got lost trying to find it. The Venetian shops are a complicated place, but I've manage to navigate it before. We literally had to call to push back the reservation because we were wandering around lost. Even after getting directions, we got lost. That's not really a reflection on them though, just make sure to plan a little extra time.  Last visit: March 2015"}
{"text":"Loved the veal Milanese and swordfish entrees. Very good service and nice ambiance. Would return again."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we came here for dinner! We were trying to fine somewhere to eat at the Venetian, which was not easy with so many places. We had Calamari, lobster ravioli (a must) and filet mignon (amazing). This will be my place to dine for sure my next visit!!! Can't go wrong, amazing food, friendly service, nice and cozy. And our server Amanda was absolutely wonderful! Thank you Amanda"}
{"text":"Before a show at the Palazzo, I came here for dinner.  First impressions were not that good as there was no one at the podium.  A waiter came up to me, didn't say anything, and then turned and left.  Another waiter came over and showed me to a table on their \"patio\" along the Grand Canal Shops at the Venetian.  The tables are very close together in this area and as has been stated in other reviews, this is a high traffic area.  I tend to like people watching so I didn't mind the traffic.  It would have been nice if I didn't have to pretend not to hear the conversation of the two women at the table an arm's length from me.  I was brought a menu and asked about drinks.  Soon a server came with three cheese and garlic rolls and some balsamic and EVOO which he left on the table.  My iced tea was brought and I ordered.  Asking the server what was the smallest appetizer, he suggested the caprese.  I ordered the caprese and the pesto gnocchi.    The caprese was OK.  The tomatoes were hot house tomatoes and not very flavorful and a bit hard.  The burrata was quite good.  The pouch of cheese pulled apart and I could place it on the tomato slices.  My server had done some freshly grated pepper on the caprese and that helped.  The best appetizer would have been simply the cheese with some bread and EVOO and let the tomatoes die on the hothouse floor.  The pesto gnocchi was pretty standard.  There wasn't a strong pesto flavor, but the gnocchi were soft and tasty.  After dinner, the server brought me a tray of dessert replicas and I chose the tiramisu.  It's done in a manner you don't see very often.  Instead of a cake like dessert, this version is mostly cream with lots of chocolate powder and some pieces of cake and chocolate near the bottom of the cream.  This was the best part of the meal.  The cream was perfect.  My only complaint is the dessert was served in a fluted goblet, but in the manner of drizzling syrups and sauces over dishes for looks, the plate on which the goblet rested was lined with caramel sauce and confectioners' sugar.  Why decorate a plate on which there's no food?  In fact, I got part of my hand on the caramel and I needed to find a washroom after I left to wash it all off.  Service was good except for the start.  The place is OK but it's not a place I need to return to for Italian food.  Too many choices in this complex alone."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I ordered the shrimp scampi and the sauce was to die for. The server was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"The location in the Ventian Hotel is lovely. You can dine indoors or in the outside area and watch people go by (it is not actually outdoors, it is just outside the eatery.) The service is great, every server is kind and knows the menu well. They can make great suggestions for you, but the menu does speak for itself. There is not a bad meal to be had (I don't eat veal, so I can't comment on that, but I have been told it is great). They have some great pizza and eat pasta offering is fantastic. Like most places in the Ventian Hotel, you will find exceptional service, food and you will not be rushed. Enjoy."}
{"text":"What a disgusting experience. First of all, disclaimer, my boyfriend and I always tip our waitresses for their service. And I can proudly say we tip very well. Our total came out to be $52.50 and I have gave the waitress $62.50 making this $10 back in cash. We waited 5 minutes while he continuously passed by our table taking care of the other customers, mind you this place was not busy at all. Finally my boyfriend spoke up to another person asking for our receipt,  and our change. A few minutes go by and our waiter comes back to our table with a crumpled up receipt. His response was \" I always throw away the receipts, here you go\" and I quickly respond, \"What about my change?\" He hesitated and mumbled upon words and began to explain of how he was confused that I have give him $62.50. And I responded once again \"To get  $10 back\" he then REACHES into his OWN pocket and pulls out HIS tip money and gives me MY $10. I took that money got up and gave it to the busser who actually helped us. I'm sorry but last time I heard it's an option to tip and not a requirement. He didn't give me the option, he just jumped right into it.  This man is an older man with white combed back hair. I am disgusted."}
{"text":"What a pleasant little restaurant.  The prices were very reasonable given the other restaurants in Vegas and the food was delicious.  The setting is like a small street side restaurant in Italy.  The staff look like they are all family.  The meal starts with warm bread and olive and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  The lasagna and penne vodka were delivered very quickly and more then met our expectation.  The lasagna was loaded with cheese and meat.  the pasta was al dente like you would find in Italy.  The only downside to the experience is the view which looks out across to a fast food lobster restaurant and being a small restaurant  you hear conversations from nearby loud tables.  But this is certainly a restaurant we will visit again."}
{"text":"Trattoria Reggiano is located inside the Venetian, but in a part that is somewhat out of the way. We stumbled across it on our way to find the passage to the Palazzo, in which we were staying, but I don't think that we would have discovered it otherwise. There is a limited amount of \"indoor\" and \"outdoor\" seating available, in quotations because the entire thing---which is basically doused with that charming mom-and-pop vibe---is inside a hotel, all decorated with a retro-Italian theme.  I ordered the Penne Primavera, a veggie-full dish with no sauce but just a dash of garlic for taste. It came fairly quickly, which was a relief because we were so hungry, but they also give you unlimited baskets of bread to eat with olive oil and vinegar. The Penne ended up being the slighlty-bland you would expect from something so healthy, but as I am trying to eat clean I decided it was a good choice and jealously eyed my friends' spaghetti and meatballs and Linguini Bolognese. I only had a taste of each, but I can attest that Trattoria sauce is exceptional. The meat is tender and perfectly complements the pasta.  There are no refills on drinks, however, because they come in bottles. (Water, of course, has refills)."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas!  The prices are very reasonable for being in the Venetian, and the service and the food are great.    They are now serving their buttery garlicy rolls warm after many requests from the customers.  Warning, they are so good that you may finish them all before the appetizer comes out and you will ruin your meal.  My wife always gets the penne with the vodka sauce and I try something different everytime.  So far, we've been pleased with all of our choices."}
{"text":"Love the service and the atmosphere. I indulged myself in the calamari and gnocchi. My wife had the tortellini. Both were so good. The pasta was very fresh. I have a new favorite Italian place to eat at. I will be coming back here for many more years."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian food this is the place. The pasta is all homemade and as fresh as you can get it. The baked ziti with meatballs was incredible. I wish I could have finished it all, but I had to save some room for all my beer later. The fresh bread was also very good and my wife loved her ravioli too! It's a nice little Italian place with the feeling of a small town place. The service was great too.  The prices are very reasonable for Vegas. If you are looking for a super fancy dinner though, this isn't the place as it's more casual. We had a pretty bad dinner the night after, and said we wish would have just gone back to this place for the second night in a row. We will be going back next time we are in Las Vegas for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great ambiance and friendly excellent service. Pizza and pastas were delicious!"}
{"text":"We had just checked out of the Venetian and were looking for a nice place to have lunch on our last day in Vegas. Yelp led me to Trattoria Reggiano, conveniently located inside the Venetian, near the food court.  omggg UNLIMITED garlic knots!!! so. amazing. I'd come back just for that.  Our waitress had a delightful New York / Italian accent and was very charming.  Please note the usual 18% gratuity on parties of 6 or more."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The grilled chicken salad wasn't that good, it was too dry and burned. Overall the paste were about average."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food. I'm Italian and from NY. I would say hands down this is the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day on a second date.  The setup was not ideal for relaxing and getting to know someone.  The two tops are INCREDIBLY small and there were were surrounded on both sides by other two-tops, about 8-10 inches away.  I felt claustrophobic and it was uncomfortable to talk because the tables on each side of us could clearly listen in on our conversation. We might as well have all been at one big table together, that's how close we were. They need to spread things out a bit more if they want their ambiance to be better.  Stop trying to squeeze so many people in!  The food was pretty good, I told the waiter I wanted a pepperoni pizza and it came out smothered in kalamata olives and pepperoni ( I absolutely HATE olives!) Not sure why they did that...I did'nt want to complain in front of my date so I just picked them off but all I could taste was olives  :/  Pasta fagioli soup was decent, not the best I've had in the city.  Garlic knots were awesome."}
{"text":"Fun Italian restaurant. Great interaction with the staff.  The pizza  had a nice tomato sauce and crust that you wanted to save for bread sticks the next day. Will come back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! What a cute date spot. The tables are in the middle of the walkway of the grand canal shoppes, which is loud... But we enjoyed ourselves nonetheless.   Hubby ordered calamari- for $15, the portions were HUGE, and he said they were cooked perfectly! I got the marinated balsamic basil chicken salad for $16, which was one of the only gluten free items on the menu. It was delicious! The olive oil is some of the best I've ever had, and I couldn't stop pouring it on everything. The rolls that come out gratis are hot and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Hubby also got a moretti beer- his favorite!  Amanda our server was so sweet and accommodating. I really appreciate how knowledgeable she was about the menu, especially with my severe gluten allergy. She made sure I knew exactly what was safe to eat, and what wasn't. I truly appreciated her concern.   Unfortunately, the other waiter working the lunch shift yesterday, a tall thin man with spiky hair, was so rude to everyone, yelling at his tables and then yelling right next to our table when the hostess seated a couple in his station, screaming that he couldn't handle any more tables and that someone needed to help him! It was so sad! I'm so glad we had Amanda as our server and not him; he would have ruined our meal.   The espresso is illy but it's watery and not worth the $4.50 price point. It does come with a mini cantucci though.   The other disappointing thing about the restaurant was the horrifically rude floor manager/hostess, in a brown striped top with brown hair. She yelled at us when we asked about gluten free options before sitting down, as if she couldn't even waste her time talking to us, and told us to leave- thankfully Amanda saved us and said that yes there were gluten free options, albeit few, and that she'd be more than happy to help us."}
{"text":"Excellence in all aspects of a restaurant. Food was excellent. Service was excellent.  Not to be missed: the Eggplant Rolatini appetizer and the cannoli, (insert vulgar descriptive word here) AMAZING! Eat here, you wont be disappointed;)"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a hidden gem at The Venetian. I would never have thought to give this place a try had it not been for the thick \"Yellow Pages\" type book in the hotel room (where it was listed) and for Yelp. My friend and I came here around 5:30 on a Saturday and were, luckily, seated right away (I don't believe they take reservations). It is a small restaurant, but quaint. I love that the waiters spoke Italian; it made it more authentic to me. Also, our waiter was funny and really nice.  As for the food, it's yummy. The portions are big and you won't hurt your wallet eating here. Thank you to whoever suggested the meatballs. I think they are, by far, the best I've ever had. They were full of flavor and super moist. The garlic rolls were delicious as well. I was torn between the Penne in Vodka Sauce and Linguine Carbonara and the waiter suggested the latter. I am definitely glad he steered me that way because it was really good. If I had more room in my stomach I would've devoured the last three or four bites. My friend had the pepperoni pizza (I can't remember what it was listed under on the menu) and that was good as well (super big portions, it's like ordering a medium from Pizza Hut). The tiramisu was a perfect ending to the meal. I'd love to come here again and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing food and absolutely loved the staff. Great portions of food and lots to choose from. I tried many dishes and deserts and I can't pick a favorite cause it was all delicious."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here. It's tucked in just past the food court in the Venetian. We had a couple of pizzas and a pasta dish. The service was friendly and attentive. Definitely a good option if you're looking to sit down and get out of the busyness if the Venetian."}
{"text":"Garlic bread rolls: They were warm and buttery.  They served good quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar with it.    Chicken Caesar Salad: tasted good and, the chicken was freshly grilled.   Linguini with clam sauce: lotsa clams and it's very good.   Shrimp scampi: best we've had.  Shrimp was fresh...   Free cannoli for dessert: yummy!  we got it free when they honored a coupon from the Grand Canal Shoppes Premier Passport which you can obtain from the concierge (it has coupons for shops and restaurants).   A bit pricey with the whole meal at $70+ but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Had a great time this past weekend! Loved their new singer. Beautiful voice! I hope this will be a regular for the weekend. I'm still dreaming about my amazing pizza. Great addition to downtown"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian and freshly made! Recommend to anyone wanting good Italian on the Strip"}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Italian food but I absolutely loved this place!! The Venetian is wonderful to begin with... but there's something so charming about the illusion of being in Italy, throughout the dinner we actually wanted to believe that we were in an authentic Italian street side café, with perfect blue skies (although it was already night time).   We sat in the \"outside patio\" portion of the restaurant and even though there was a lot of hurried-people watching, you couldn't help to feel that the ambiance was still relaxing, as if time had stood still. The service was great and the servers were not at all worried to rush their customers out of there.  We had wine, the Chicken parmesan, and gnocchi's.... all very delicious. The portions are big so we didn't really have room for dessert.  I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal! We started with the Calamari and the Caprese Mozzarella. The calamari perfectly cook and the Mozzarella creamy and delicious.  I had the linguini with clams. The pasta perfectly cooked and the little neck clams overflowing!  My husband had the eggplant and pasta that was to die for!  Then on the to dessert!  We shared a piece of ricotta cheese cake that was smooth and tasty. One of the best I have had in a long time. We also had the cannoli that had great filling and a nice crunchy shell. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It is definitely a place we will be coming back to time and time again!"}
{"text":"Sucks! That was my overall experience! I am sorry! After we have been seated we waited about 10 minutes and no one came to greet us and to take orders!! What!!! We went around 1 PM on a Sunday and they were not even busy at all! I wonder how bad it could have been if they were actually busy! After 10 minutes here came this waitress who looked like just woke up from a nap or something. So unprofessional! She looked like she didn't want to be there!! Wow!! And the food sucked too!! Chicken was so burnt!!! Literally black! And tasted burned! Too small portions felt like its kid's meal or something!!! I will never ever go there again!!"}
{"text":"Oh what a disappointment Summerlin location  Server very nice but clueless. I ordered a stella Artois. It was hot out and I so looked forward to a chilled glass of beer. What did a get.. I hot mug that belonged in a German beer haus (must have just come from dishwasher) and within seconds my beer was warm. Not to mention that glass itself was heavy as hell. Strike 1.. Asked server for a \"stella\" glass and she said sorry we don't carry them. Well then don't offer then beer if you can't serve it properly.   Next ordered the Cesar. That was ok but soooo much dressing I was scraping it off with my knife. Also for an Italian restaurant not much of a selection for Salads.   Next. they are supposed to be know for their . I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti was not fresh or home maid and for the meatballs.  Flavorless. I actually had to salt them and the sauce. I'm 100% Irish and my \"gravy\" is way better. This sauce was so sweet it tastes like tomatoes and sugar.   Finally.. Cheap plates and Togo bags for leftovers which I didn't mind since I had no desire to eat mine.   Sorry but I will not return which is sad because it's a beautiful mall and location."}
{"text":"Update to my review -  We came back to this restaurant for lunch on a 2nd trip to Vegas, which i NEVER do (like to try new spots). Again, very good. Super casual lunch, nothing too wowwing about it ambiance wise, but i had an amazing salad, we got the chicken parm again, and the garlic bread knots - wowwie so good. It takes us forget to navigate thru Venetian to find it but worth it.   (original review): HANDS DOWN... Best ever. Highly recommend. Very casual feel, small place, but absolutely amazingly delicious food, charming server, and just an all around authentic traditional italian feel. From the olive oil and vinegar on the table for fresh bread, the delicious sauce, their tiramisu - delicious. 3/5 of us got the chicken parm - it was delicious. Salads were great and shrimp scampi meal also great. If you're staying in or near the Venetian, you've got to go here. I had just a wonderful experience... thanks to Yelp, because that's how i found it!!"}
{"text":"In the Venetian, do like Italians do: late dinner in a trattoria. But, we we're probably very late for American standards. Although we had to wait for a table upon arrival, within 15-20 minutes half the restaurant was empty. This was around 09.30/10.00 p.m. But we didn't mind. Good atmosphere, nice staff, excellent food.  We shared half a family platter with charcuterie and cheeses. More than enough. Only thing that could have been better were the roasted peppers and bell peppers. Unfortunatly not fresh. An it's so easy, and so cheap to make them from scratch......:(. And after ordering they ran out of eggplant. So no parmigiani melanzane. My favorite dish in the world.  The bread is very nice. Warm, preparered with a lot of garlic and butter. Served with olive oil and balsamico.  Both the appetizer and the entrees were excellent. The swordfish came with a nice choice of vegetables and potatoes. The soup with beans and pasta had a nice taste and bit."}
{"text":"Had it not been for yelp, we probably would have never tried this place and I'm so glad we found it.   The food was great, they have a nice wine selection and the service was good. The meatballs were delicious and so was the carbonara. The atmosphere was not what I had expected, but overall this is a great spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is our favorite go to Italian restaurant whenever we visit Las Vegas.  Foods are delicious such as Spaghetti with meatballs,  Linguine with clams and their pizza is amazing.  It's very authentic and traditional Italian.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Great view, nice seating, but the service was bad.  John was uptight, and mumbled.  He was slow to get our order, and never asked us if we wanted a second drink.  Our glasses where empty before we got our meal, and never once asked.  Its too bad, because the food was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just finished a late lunch at this restaurant and let me tell you.....it is now our new favorite place!!! We were completely blown away by the atmosphere and the excellent service we received. Our servers name was Heather*** (I'm sorry heather!) and she was terrific. We also got a chance to meet the restaurant Manager, Mimmo. He is one of the main reasons we will be returning to this restaurant, besides the tasty food, of course! Mimmo is from Rome, Italy and he makes you feel like part of the family.   The atmosphere is outstanding. I absolutely love the layout of this cute little restaurant. The kitchen is open so you could see everything which is a really great touch.   They bring free garlic knots to the table, which they are so soft and accented with Parmesan and Romano cheese. We decided to start off with some calamari as our appetizer. It was the best calamari I have ever had! It was so tender and perfect. So, compliments to the chef.   For our entrees we ordered baked ravioli and baked ziti and those were excellent as well! I am completely impressed by this cute little restaurant and I will keep returning to enjoy their great food!"}
{"text":"Don't let the proximity to the food court fool you- this is a nice, sit down restaurant. Yummy Italian food & great service."}
{"text":"AMAZING Food and amazing service. Beautiful place, relaxing and delicious. Italiano at it's best. Next time I have to try the desert but the food was so good that I over ate. Worth every penny in my book."}
{"text":"Took a party of 3 around 8pm last night. Outdoor seating was perfect for the weather. Nice area to eat. However both hostesses were either completely new to the business or new to a customer service job. No smile .... No nothing ... Barking out seating times. The alcoholic drinks were great , the food was average. The server was good and made me feel like I was in New York. Accent attached!! Wouldn't recommend the lobster tortellini.... But the meatballs and spaghetti were great.  Overall .... Would return only in a pinch."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, not really mind blowing.  I had the pasta carbonara and we had calamari and the filet mignon meatballs as appetizers.  The filet mignon meatballs were great and everything else was just OK.  Prices were high for what it was and other than the calamari the servings were small to meadium sized at best."}
{"text":"Subpar Italian place located in the Venetian Hotel. It was fine for a dinner out with nothing glaringly wrong, but just didn't impress.   The atmosphere is nothing spectacular and even kind of strange with no views except a gift shop and other stores. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The garlic knots at the beginning were probably the best part of the meal- very fluffy and flavorful.   I wasn't feeling so hot so I just got soup and a Caesar salad. The soup was 12 dollars for a bowl of pasta e fagioli. The soup was good, not great and had way more beans than broth. It almost didn't even feel like a soup because of how many beans there were! I'm all for beans in a soup, but I want to feel like I'm eating soup at the same time. The salad was just alright, nothing special. My friends felt the same about all of their dishes. Just meh overall! Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"First time here and really enjoyed the food. Service was great but we sometimes waited a little bit for the waiter to return - it wasn't all that busy, but he was very attentive to each table and was wonderful otherwise. I didn't realize the place was small inside, but that kept it quaint. Definitely looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Meatballs and bread for starters.  Wife had the Eggplant Parm and I had the Chicken Parm.  Both were amazing.  The Canoli for desert was the best I have had.  Fresh and Delicious food...would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife go there once a week to have a couple of drinks, and a pizza.  The food is very good.  Bethany is a great bartender.  Recently they added live music, which, in my opinion makes the dining experience worse.  The musicians are pretty old, have way too much hair dye, and sing songs that attracts an older crowd.  The sad part is that after a while, the sixty-somethings begin to dance, and let everyone know how drunk they are.  Hopefully they can trim down the number of nights that they have live music."}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian food in the Venetian Mall! If you're lucky enough to be in Vegas and at the Venetian, don't skip this very popular spot in the Mall. The atmosphere on the patio has the urban street scene feel with all the mall customers walking by; lot's of hustle and bustle but it's not distracting like having a slot machine ringing in your ear. It was loud, boisterous... but nice! Very cool joint that I can't wait to visit again.  WHEN YOU GO- Ask for Sergio and wait if you have to. The guy's worth it! DO NOT skip the Filet Mignon Meatballs. They're as good as they sound. Lobster Ravioli, Chicken Parm and lobster ravioli are winners as well.  Very nice spot that is from now on in my regular Las Vegas resto rotation!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the speed was unacceptable. The appetizers come out timely but the main dish takes a bit too long. The people to the left and right of us sat way later than us and got their food before us. We only ordered pasta. Nothing that takes long to cook at all. Seems this was a one-off situation but it was properly made up to us when brought to the manager's attention. Since the business practice of taking care of customers was satisfactory, I adjusted the review to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Customer service is the only reason I'm giving 3 stars, not sure if I came on a bad day but when I came here 2 years ago and the quality of the food was 10 times better and cheaper. Definitely not worth the $20+ pasta plates or $14 calamari.  Unfortunately will not be coming back or recommending this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"The service was amazing here. We came here during their lunch time on a Sunday. They had a brunch menu, which was basically similar to their dinner menu but in a smaller portion. However, this portion was definitely not small at all. It just seemed like they served dinner portion food in a small plate. We ordered couple beers, and they were served in a cold icy glass, which we loved for a sunny Sunday afternoon. Also, we ordered their carbonara pasta with shrimp and Vongole. The linguine was cooked perfect, and so was the spaghetti. I love their shrimp for some reason, since they cook it so tender.   Our server-I believe his name was Anthony- was friendly, attentive and caring. We found a random piece of thick thread in our vongole, but didn't really care. It was not a hair or anything. We killed the dish, and at the end of the meal, we told the server that the food was amazing-however, we still went ahead and told them about the little piece that we found so they could prevent it from happening to other customers-since some people do rage about nothing.  The manager came over to our table and apologized. I do not think it was their fault, since things like this can happen. He comped the pasta dish for us, which made us feel horrible. However, we left the amount as tip, and left very satisfied.  TIP! The Andes Mint Chocolates they give at the end of your meal are perfect dessert!  Love every aspect of this restaurant. I specially like this location better than venetian one. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Not sure if some people dined on the wrong day, but my family and I had a great dinner at Trattoria Reggiano. It was my second time dining here, and they impressed me one more time. We ordered pasta al aglio e olio, linguine with clams (with white sauce) and the oven grilled bruschetta pizza. There was nothing special from the appetizers or the salad section so we did not order anything, but their garlic knots were more than enough for us to start the dinner. I personally loved their bread. It was tasty with just enough oil as well. The flavor went very well with the balsamic and olive oil.   Food was served very promptly as it should be for pastas. The presentation did have anything special but the food smelled delicious. I didnt add shrimp to my aglio e olio this time because my sister is allergic to shrimp, but you can also add some for 6 dollars, and their shrimps are always cooked very nicely. We wanted gnocci but they were out of pesto sauce, so we didnt, but I would definitely try it next time. Linguine was tasty as well, the clams were cooked right and there was enough juice on the dish that the linguine was moist until we were done eating. The bruschetta pizza was recommended by our server, it was one of the greatest oven grilled pizzas I have had so far. The fresh mozzarella went well with it. I usually am not a big fan of onions, but even the onions tasted so yummy.   Service tonight was great as well. The staff fulfilled our needs promptly and friendly. We had a great dinner here. I am going to try their new location in Summerlin next time and try their gnocci."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.  Felt like I was sitting on an Italian street, cute, quaint and good food.  Had a cheese less pizza and some meatballs.  The meatballs were good, good sauce and warm garlicky rolls.  Sat out front, great people watching.   There are a lot of restaurants in the area (in the immediate area) and this place can hold it's own.  It's solid food, cute location and good service."}
{"text":"Been here 3-4 times in the past. Today's visit was disappointing and underwhelming. Service was quick and attentive BUT somewhat cold and unwelcoming  Spaghetti with meatballs was okay, liked it before but not so much tonight. Shrimp scampi had decent shrimp but sauce was bland. Bread, as usual, was consistent and good... A little oily this time but still good.  Better than most italian restaurants in Vegas BUT not the best I have had in comparison with restaurants in Los Angeles. SF and NYC"}
{"text":"We've been coming here since our honeymoon 2009. It was a little place that grew into a wonderful open restaurant...we have never been anything other than blissfully happy with our meal and experience.. it seems to be family run and they really care that you are happy with your service and food... my husband loves the spaghetti and meatballs and I have them make linguine Alfredo with shrimp. My only bad experience was dripping balsamic vinegar on my favorite top... love this place and will never go anywhere else in Vegas for Italian..."}
{"text":"What's a girl to do to entertain herself while her husband is at a boring convention?  Why, go out solo for a romantic Italian dinner, of course!  After a little online research, I stumbled upon Trattoria Reggiano.  The reviews looked good, and the price was right, so I decided to check it out--I'm so glad I did!   I was first taken aback by how tiny the restaurant is. Seriously, you could legitimately call it a \"hole in the wall\" because it's just that small-there are only seven tables inside and a handful of tables outside in mall walkway. As it turns out, sometimes the best things come in small packages!    When I walked in, I was immediately seated and served some fantastic bread! I placed my order and started a glass of wine. Before I could even finish my first piece of bread, my spaghetti and meatballs were already brought to the table! The service in this place was great!  My food was fantastic (apparently, previous posters weren't joking about the filet mignon meatballs)!  My check was a total of $27--not too bad at all, especially in comparison to the other Italian spots that are found all over the area.  All in all, it was a great experience. Also, this place is legit--the servers were all speaking to each other in Italian--I loved it! I definitely recommed paying Trattoria Reggiano a visit!"}
{"text":"3 star Italian. Food and service was good. Bar was slow at getting drinks to the table. The live entertainment had a speaker that was cracking so it was distracting and we didn't stay for dessert."}
{"text":"I am shocked at how many good reviews are on here. This place is very overpriced for what you get. The service was terrible, our waiter ( or the owner?) was un-friendly and abrupt. The food was really mediocre. I find it hard to believe that this restaurant received an average of 4 stars.       The only good thing was the garlic bread  This restaurant was a major disappointment"}
{"text":"After a long day in the vegas heat, me and my girlfriend were starving, tired and needing someplace to eat. We headed to the Venetian since she knew some good places there. Unfortunately all of the places she wanted to go to had long waits and we just wanted someplace to sit down and eat good fun. We were almost ready to eat at the food court when we saw this small italian cafe right next to the coffee bean. I looked at the menu and the prices were perfect, with everything under 15 dollars, best of all, no wait and we were seated immediately. Instantly garlic bread balls were brought out and they were amazing. The service was incredible, it felt like we were in someones home even though we were a few feet from the food court. We split a caeser with nice big chunks of italian cheeses along with a simple pasta and it was the perfect meal. I recommend it to anyone who just wants a place that is nice, easy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"1) Most importantly, food was an A. Pesto gnocchi was flavorful, texture was perfect. Then again, it would be hard to mess gnocchi's texture up, wouldn't it? Lobster ravioli too was full of flavor, came out pleasantly warm and both dishes were good portion sizes. As were the filet mignon meatballs, which make quite the appetizer (if you are considering ordering them, just do it). Wine prices by the glass and bottle were typical. Garlic knots were a little too reminiscent of a local pizza parlor's, but I'll take it. A little dressing of balsamic vinegar and Olive oil will do the trick.  2) Secondly, service was a B. Our server was very friendly, but simply put, we just didn't see enough of him. Of course we want to enjoy our meal privately, but more intimate interaction would have warranted two thumbs up instead of one. 3) Atmosphere was a B-. If you're sitting inside I imagine it's a little more cozy than the outside tables that are uncomfortably close to the passing Venetian guests walking by eyeballing your entrees. I hope your dining guest is easy on the eyes, for he/she will really be all there is to look at during your meal."}
{"text":"We had our annual Las Vegas trip and of course Trattoria Reggiano was on the agenda...dinner was delicious and wonderful as ever!  Scampi is my favorite and the arugula salad is exquisite.  Always a treat, always a luscious meal.  Thank you Trattoria Reggiano!"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful staff, very welcoming. I can't say anything bad about this place. I would give it 5 stars but it is noisy due to the surroundings. This place isn't 5 star fancy dining, it is very good food in a friendly, welcoming and informal atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wanted to get wowed by this place. The food was good, but I can get the same food at my neighborhood pizza place. Again, it was good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"We frequent this place. It's located in Downtown Summerlin and is next the the Regal 5. The eggplant appetizer is the best! We also like the pizza. Everything we have tried has been good. The service isn't the best but not bad enough to not go back."}
{"text":"Ok.. I'm Italian so to me to rate an Italian restaurant is really something.  I will say only one thing... Not in New York, not in Seattle... But the best Italian restaurant I have ever been is here in Las Vegas.  The clam linguine were something amazing.. Pasta al dente... It was delicious.   Pizza... Was the nearest one to the real Italian pizza. Perfect ingredients, perfect sauce and perfect mozzarella.   5 stars.. Without doubt."}
{"text":"We had a great meal last week.  Vegetables were cooked perfectly and the waiter, an older gentleman, was great with the kids.  Everyone's meal came out on time and was nice and hot.  Prices were fair.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Went there for an early lunch to avoid the crowds during peak mealtimes.   Not a bad idea since the restaurant is on the small side and they do not appear to take reservations.    After reading all the rave reviews about the meatballs, well of course I had to get them as an appy!  The server was kind enough to offer the option of cutting down the standard order down to only one or two meatballs from the usual three, so that I can enjoy the entree that I really wanted without killing myself ; ).   People weren't kidding about the meatballs -- they were great for sure, but in my opinion,Trattoria Reggiano truly shines with their killer bolognese, bar-none.    For the main, I decided on their daily special, which happened to be mushroom ravioli bolognese.  Boy was I ever in for a spectacular treat!!!  It will definitely be difficult to go back to the usual pink slime bolognese that the average restaurant serves, where the ground \"meat\" simply melts into the sauce for the most part.  Not only were the al dente ravioli large enough to be nicely stuffed with that aromatic mushroom/ricotta/goat cheese mixture, the generously portioned pillows of pasta were heavily blanketed by the other star of the dish: an uber thick and hearty meat sauce made with nothing other than abundant chunks of  high quality ground filet mignon.    Each bite was full of lean, solid meat and juicy tomato chunks.   Insane depth of flavours and textures....best pasta I've had to date, short of traveling to Italy.    The bill came to $34 but there was enough left over to cover dinner.  There was no microwave in the hotel room to heat it up but that did not diminish the food's taste by much. Still thoroughly enjoyed it unheated as much as I did at the restaurant.     Two meals of this heavenly goodness.......  OMG what a dream food day!!! =)"}
{"text":"Loved it!! Great spot. We got a 50% off entree coupon at Tix4Today-- you spend $3/person to get the coupon, but it certainly helped us save. Garlic knots were to die for, penne vodka was some of the best I've had-- smooth and silky sauce dente pasta. The Caesar was a little over dressed, but the dressing was good so I can't complain. Nice service.   The only thing I'd say is that for the Venetian the \"views\" aren't great. It's situated right near the food court adjacent to a gift shop. They did a nice job with the decor and adding some green shrubs to shield a bit. And the prices were very reasonable (all pastas were $15-$22, chicken parm $26, small Caesar $8) so for us the small tradeoff was worth it.   We will definitely be back if we are in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, though we made the mistake of arriving about 10-20 minutes before close. We wanted to sit inside because it looked cozier than the tables in the middle of the walkway, but we were told actually they were starting to clean up in there so we would have to sit outside. No problem!  However, we felt immediately like the few waitstaff were visibly upset we had been seated, particularly our waiter. He looked tired, and annoyed he had a table. So much so we literally asked him 3-4 times if it was really OK that we were sitting down to eat. He assured us it was OK if we put the order in quickly.   Overall, they pushed the food out quickly, and we all enjoyed our pizza/pasta. For the price, this place is quite the deal on the strip. You get a lot, it's in a nice indoor location, and the food was very good. If this was a normal restaurant I would give it 3 stars (entirely because of the feeling like we were a burden, the food was great), but the value vs others around make it a 4 for me."}
{"text":"Great spot!! To have dinner we shared the Ceasar salad , meat balls and baked ziti!! Delicious I'm just saying."}
{"text":"Amazing first experience here tonight. I brought an out-of-town guest so I was looking to make a good impression, it did not disappoint.  Danny was our server and Ricky worked along with him to make sure our drinks were never empty and we had everything else we needed. They brought a lovely plate of olives, cheese and peppers along with the MOST AMAZING garlic knots to munch on before our meal. I had the Chicken Parmesan; it's really tasty and the portions are huge!  I will definitely come back. Thank you to Danny and Ricky for takin care of us ladies and making us feel welcome."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here and really enjoyed it.  It's a small restaurant with limited seating but the wait was not bad at all.  The service was great with a friendly staff.  The food was really good.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs which was really good.  For dessert we shared a cannoli.  I have been to Italy and have my favorite places in New York to get cannoli's and this place was just as good.  I recommend this place for sure.  Great service, good food and great price for the meal."}
{"text":"Wow! From the moment you walk in to this place you know you are going to eat real Italian food! The smells in here are stunning! The kitchen overlooks the dinning area so you can see your food being cooked right in front of you! Very cozy intimate spot, great for a date night and great food! Staff was excellent and took care of all our needs. I had the chicken parm, it was very tasty, chicken was juicy and not fried tasting. Red sauce is very Southern Italian, pizzas are big and flavorful. This will be a weekly spot to eat at! Finally real Italian food in Summerlin! Looking forward to trying other dishes!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good. We came here on our first night in Vegas since we were craving Italian food. The staff was super friendly and happy to answer any questions we had. They give you bread while you wait and it was delicious! Buttery and covered in Parmesan cheese. I ordered the linguine with clams and my boyfriend got the chicken Parmesan. Seriously amazing. I ate every last bite! My mouth is watering just thinking about it haha. If you're in the mood for Italian food go here. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Authentic YUMMY Italian food!!!!  A nice refreshing change from your typical Vegas strip choices.  It's a very small place, so be prepared for a wait.  But the wait won't be as long as the crazy waits at big, popular restaurants.  This place is definitely worth it!  We had the spaghetti and meatballs, a grilled chicken salad, and seafood linguini.  The pre-meal bread was quite delicious as well.  Prices were very reasonable as well for being located in the Venetian."}
{"text":"Once again \"thank you\" Trattoria Reggiano for making my dining experiences a pleasure each and every time I eat here.  Each time I visit Las Vegas I make it a point to eat here; although this year I was only able to make it in once.  The service is fantastic and the ambiance is certainly like visiting a small Italian restaurant in Italy.    It is always a pleasure to see server John, whom I mostly always have wait on me, even if we have to wait for an open table in his area.  Also it was nice to see and say hello to Carl, who has also waited on me when John was off for the night.  The service was just as wonderful as always and it is so nice to have John and the other staff remembers me from year to year.   The new manager, Flavia, who has been there about 1 year, replaced the previous manager, Stephano, who went to one of the family's other restaurants.  Flavia was a just a pleasure to talk with and I enjoyed her.  I look forward to seeing her and the rest of the staff on my next trip.      Menu items chosen on this trip:  Arugula and Cherry Tomato Salad and Spaghetti Puttanesca.  Great salad and fantastic Spaghetti.  Be sure to stop by and have some garlic pizza dough rolls slathered with olive oil once you sit down."}
{"text":"Their food is very good. They provide a complimentary plate with cheese, olives and peppers for a small starter. After, they give garlic knots (which are only ok. Not the best I've ever had, but still yummy. Besides, they're free.) I ordered a pasta & a pizza. The baked ziti was FANTASTIC! I really enjoyed the sauce, and it's very very cheesy. I had the Salame Picante Pizza, which was also very good. The crust is really why it was fantastic. It's a thin crust pizza, but not super crispy and hard to eat. The olives are definitely fresh, italian olives. Unfortunately, the food does not make this place worth going to. For a 75 dollar dinner (for two people) I expect MUCH more.   The reason I'm not giving it 4 or 5 stars is because of the atmosphere, lack of unprofessionalism, and the manager. Our server, who was from North Carolina, did well. No complaints there. My complaint is mostly in regards to the open kitchen and the manager, Dan, who truly does not care at all. With an open kitchen, you must teach your cooks how to behave. When I sit down in front of an open kitchen, I have zero desire to listen to the cooks personal music blasting from their phones. If you're gonna have an open kitchen, you should probably tell your cooks that if theres guests sitting four feet away, the music restaurant should suffice.   Something else that was frustrating was having the football game on. I personally don't care that the football game was on - especially since it's the beginning of the season. What I do mind is when you allow your staff to walk around yelling \"TOUCHDOWN!\" Again, there are guests here. I paid 75 dollars to eat my dinner in a nice restaurant, not buffalo wild wings.  LASTLY, my biggest issue of all - the manager Dan. When I expressed my concerns, Dan just stood there. After about 30 seconds, he says \"I'll address it.\" Not a \"Im sorry. You're right, that's not acceptable.\" Nothing. I already paid my bill, I had zero intention of a comped item. But Dan is by far the most lack luster, uncaring manager ever. Perhaps Trattoria Regiano in Venetian holds their staff to a higher standard than this location.  In sum, If you're going to Downtown Summerlin and are looking for a nice meal - go anywhere else. You'll actually enjoy the atmosphere of Shake Shack better."}
{"text":"try this place, you won't be disappointed! lobster ravioli was amazing, meatballs and ziti were so darn delicious, pasta was cooked perfectly, complimentary garlic rolls and a mini charcuterie plate of olives roasted bell peppers and parmesan chunks are the details that make this Italian restaurant truly special. The service here is warm friendly and welcoming. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a slice of Italy. The service is awesome and only second to the food. Small, elegant and better than mama's cooking. Affordable and a little hard to find but worth looking for. Ask for John."}
{"text":"5 star quality food at this little restaurant tucked away in the Venetian.  The garlic knots are the best I have EVER tasted!  My sister got the spaghetti and meatballs, I had the chicken parm. Both of our plates were cleaned! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I try my best to be honest and detailed so that other tourists can make an informed decision regarding visiting an establishment.   My wife and I were in Vegas looking for good Italian food. We searched Yelp and other resources and decided we wanted to try this restaurant.   Our journey: this is not the restaurants fault, but worth noting. Not knowing how to get to this establishment we relied on the directory. BIG MISTAKE. no joke it took us 20 min to find this place. After asking, and looking at several directories ( that show \"you are here\" backwards from where you really are). At one point my wife and I were tempted to just eat any place, but it became a game to find this restaurant. Once here it was smaller than expected and kind of exposed to the mall. But we were happy to find it!   The service was superb! Wish I remembered our waiters name. A younger Italian gentleman. Super nice, checked on us at all the right times. Overall very good service.   Food: we both had Caesar salads that were very good. I had chicken parmesan which was great and my wife had chicken Marsala. It was honestly very good food.   Our bill came and it was \"cheap\" for Vegas, around $80 or so. Considering we had great service and good food I put $120 bucks in the binder and we finished our drinks. Our waitress took the bill, asked if we needed change and I said no you're all set. 2 min later he walked pasted us and thanked us which was nice. As we left he made it a point to thank us again saying he really appreciated it. I wasn't looking for that, but it was very nice of him.   I recommend this place. No frills, small, but great food with good service."}
{"text":"Yelp found us a wonderful place for Father's Day dinner as we began a two week road trip. Service was EXCEPTIONAL! Hilda was sweet and attentive as were the bussers. She even brought a small cannoli to my husband for dessert.  Food was great! You start with a little appetizer dish of peppers, olives and parm cheese chunks along with the best garlic knots ever. Could have stopped there. So good! And Hilda brought MORE!! Swordfish Siciliana was delicious - tender, juicy approx 8oz piece was plenty to share with capers, olives and tomatoes. We shared it along with the eggplant pizza which had a crispy thin crust and sliced eggplant and riccota. Lovely. Kid had what looked to be house made tortellini. Can't tell you much more than they disappeared quickly.   Wonderful experience in Vegas, away from the drama of the strip."}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit. So when it's winter time in Vegas,  the intense craving of warmth draws me here biweekly until the ice thaws. My go-to order is meatballs, garlic knots, broccoli rabe, and pasta e fagioli. I'm pretty sure everything on the menu is good, but I can't risk ordering my go-to items. You have all your food group to feel good about your meal especially after good workout session. The atmosphere is beautiful with just the right amount of class but not stuffy. I picked up a togo order on a Thursday night once and it was bustling with life music. In Vegas, there's no shortage of Italian food, but this place has the right amount seasoning in all categories."}
{"text":"This place has just served me a delicious meal. The garlic rolls were very good and the swordfish siciliano style is out of this world. The wine selection was small but I was able to find a nice one to go with my meal. The vegetables that accompanied the entree were perfectly steamed."}
{"text":"I must say this trattoria inside the Venetian is quite delectable. Both the food and the service were excellent!  The more notable entrees were the 4-cheese pizza, linguini frutti di mare (contains shrimp, baby clams, and calamari tossed in a spicy red clam sauce over pasta), linguine carbonara (linguine al dente, imported pancetta, egg yolks, and parmigiano reggiano).   The dishes tasted more authentic Italian than one would have expected. The garlic bread knots served were so good I wish I had the room to eat more of them.  All in all, terrific restaurant in a very nice hotel with very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"This was soooooo good! It was by far my favorite meal in Vegas. I enjoyed everything I tasted--the garlic knots, calamari, salad, and cappelini pomodoro. What a lovely meal! I'll definitely make a point to go back here if I'm ever in Vegas again."}
{"text":"I am confused by the high rating on here. The tables were sort of in the middle of a food court. The food was very mediocre and Italian is one of those types where it's hard to go wrong. The pasta was nothing to brag about. The pizza was eh... And the soup was bland. The best part about the meal was the bread... Now that was delicious!   Our server had major attitude. Told me to \"chill out\" when I was trying to move items on the table to make room for the food, then he spilled Parmesan cheese in my drink. When I asked for a new cup he rolled his eyes and told his busser, someone had put cheese in my drink and \"I want a new one\" like he was mocking me. It was just bizarre. He seemed miserable. Anyway... There are way better places to go for Italian in Vegas. Checked this one off the list!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The garlic knots were so delicious, it was hard to stop at two.... ok, maybe four. No oil/vinegar or butter required. I ordered a custom pizza... pepperoni w/ mushrooms and artichokes. The mushrooms were so fresh, that I would order a basic mushroom pizza some other time. No complaints whatsoever when it comes to the food. We got a table quickly, but the wait time for service was a bit slow, I guess because they were so busy. It was a Thursday. My boyfriend and his mom loved the bolognese sauce. Oh, and one more tip... they close at 11, not 12 (at least, not on weekdays) like their site states. The night before we ate there, we got there too late because of this. Update your hours!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and were happy with the awesome service and the satisfying food.  We made reservations last minute, were seated immediately, and had a really attentive waiter throughout. The food came out super quickly which was great because we were definitely hungry!   They started us off with some complimentary bread - soft, fresh, cheesy, and oh so fluffy! A wonderful start to the meal!   We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer. This came with 3 generously sized meatballs. PACKED with flavor and high-quality filet mignon and pork loin. Delicious but a little on the salty side! The meatballs came with lots of marinara sauce, making it perfect to pair with the bread!   For pastas, I ordered the daily special - a penne with pine nuts, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and tomato sauce. I asked for the penne to be replaced with spaghetti and they did it with a smile! This was simple, nothing spectacular, but definitely memorable because THIS WAS HUGEEEE! It came as a mountain and I was overwhelmed by how much there was. Thankfully boyfriend was around for me to funnel most of the mountain too!   My boyfriend ordered the linguine bolognese and I loved his dish so much more than mine. Delicious, high-quality bolognese paired so wonderfully with the perfectly cooked linguine. Definitely recommend this dish! This also came as a mountain of pasta.   You will not leave Trattoria hungry at all!"}
{"text":"Food was good- the food alone i would probably consider giving 4 stars for actually!   However, customer service was absolutely abominable.  We literally only saw our server 3 times while we were at the restaurant- for our drink order, food order, and to give us the check. We sat at our table for quite some time before our server came by, we had to ask 3 times for water for the table, he didn't ask us if we wanted another round of cocktails, he basically ignored us the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"Finished a spa afternoon at Canyon Ranch Spa in the Venetian, was thinking of going up to my room to get some preparty zzz's but the smell of olive oil and garlic coming from the tiny little paper stand size Trattoria Reggiano pulled me in like a fish with a hook in it's mouth.  As I approach I see two italian guys (one a manager, the other a venetian executive) talking, the waiter is italian, and the 3 groups of people who are sitting at the florentine style lunch tables are italian.....where the hell am I again????  oh right, cheesey version of italy and italians are eating here...done and done.   Sit down, get a glass of Nero d'alvola and some unbelievably garlicy buttered bread with smooth peppery olive oil and thick not at all vinegary balsamic (good quality for you neophytes).  I could of had the bread and wine and called it a day...but I didn't...good thing.  We had the warm spinach salad with goat cheese and it was perfect as well as splitting the Linguine Alle Vongole in Marinara... littlenecks very fresh (lived in Boston for last 4 years and these smelled and tasted like the ocean) and perfect arrabbiata style marinara.  Cannoli was crunchy and filled on location.  Espresso not that great for a place that has so many italians in it, compared to the places in italy i've had coffee, but slight oversight maybe.  Being so close to our neighbors I made a comment about the caprese looking awesome...and they gave me some, I felt rude but I ate it anyway because it was really good.  Moist mozzarella, red soft straight from garden smelling tomatoes and large pieces of basil with same awesome Balsamic....it was a perfect mid lunch/dinner and will go again when i'm back up in Vegas."}
{"text":"Come for the Garlic knots and complimentary antipasto plate...they are the best things offered here. The location is great (next to movie theatre) and I can see why it would be a goto spot in Downtown Summerlin. The patio seating with live lounge music is a nice place to hang out during the weekend...make sure to place reservations. The singer will politely ask for your favorite songs but then play her own lol...it's her thing :) A bottle of wine and great service from Sam and Daniel, the manager, plus the Garlic knots make this place worth revisiting. The food is lackluster and overpriced but TR's crowd doesn't seem to mind.  Chicken Marsala, Veal Piccata  - Both very pedestrian. I think these dishes cater to the older crowd that doesn't like bold flavors but enjoys shuffle board. It reminded me of something I might get at a buffet.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend TR to anyone that wants good Italian food or knows how to cook. But if you want ambiance and don't mind making a meal out of the Garlic knots, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"I'm going to echo the other million reviews - this place is difficult to find. If you're going to find this place sans directory, it's sandwiched between the food court and the main shopping area accessible via the Casino.  Food was good, but not exceptional - except for the garlic bread - though I may just be a sucker for pre-meal bread.   The chicken parmigiana was crispy and moist, served alongside a bed of linguini, doused in tomato sauce and a generous helping of cheese. It's not the most amazing chicken parmigiana I've had, but it was done well. Noodles were al dente and complemented the chicken, though there seemed to be a half portion of noodles to a whole portion of chicken.  Prices are typical Strip prices, around $25 after tip/tax which is decent since this was in the Venetian."}
{"text":"Our waiter, John, was great. There were plenty of reservation options available for dinner on Saturday night through Opentable.com. I started with a Cosmopolitan that tasted like a delicious, sweet candy concoction. John brought us some warm garlic knots that were soft little pillows of heaven. You could also dip them in olive oil and balsamic that were brought to the table. I ordered the pssta fagioli soup. It was hot and hearty. I appreciate when food is served hot... I then tucked into a bowl of pasta carbonara. The pasta was a little thicker than I prefer but cooked just right and the sauce was spot on. My dining companion enjoyed a white sangria thst was visually appealing with beautiful fruit followed by lobster ravioli. Needless to say, there were no leftovers. A great dinner option while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Usuallly love this place but when you're #glutenfree and you order gluten-free food, even asking them to double check, send it back because it's not gluten free, get another one, eat it and then find out it wasn't gluten free #gonnabesick #glutenfreefail"}
{"text":"Considering the much more expensive alternatives around the Strip, this is probably the best Italian place for the money. We both had the Spaghetti Puttanesca with Calamari for starters. The spaghetti was delicious and the calamari was super crispy. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on Yelp and TripAdvisor about Trattoria Reggiano, I had to give it a shot...and I'm sure glad I did!   Since I arrived into town late for a convention and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat, I was dining alone. This caused a bit of a problem because while there was a small line (maybe 10 people waiting), I did not want to take up an empty table of 4 or 6 if there were other parties behind me that would fit the table better. So I suggested to the hostess to seat the parties behind me until a smaller table opened up for me. She felt so bad that she immediately brought me a complementary glass of wine! After about 10 minutes of sipping my wine at a coffee shop across the way, she excitedly waved for me to come over. Upon seating me, she immediately poured me another glass of wine and thanked me for being so nice. THIS is the way a restaurant should treat its customers! In fact, while eating my dinner, I noticed how friendly the staff was to each other. What a great group of servers!  Now onto the food... Having been raised by an Italian mother in New York, I was cautiously optimistic about all the rave reviews. I ordered the linguine with shrimp marinara, which not only arrived piping hot...but with perfectly cooked pasta and about 20 LARGE shrimp. Now, this is how I'd normally make it for my family at home...but for a restaurant, this was outstanding! What really made the dish was the scrumptious was the pasta sauce with its chunks of garlic and fresh cut basil. Watching other dished being served, all I could think of was how fresh everything was. Sooo good! The garlic rolls that were served were the perfect accompaniment.  I was so pleased with my meal ($24) and the friendly service that I made sure to tip the waiter well and I even sneaked the hostess $10 on the way out. I felt it was the least I could do for the two free glasses of wine she served me!  What a delight this restaurant was. Small, cozy, romantic and very friendly. It reminded me of many of the small restaurants I used to visit with my family in NYC's Little Italy as a kid. It's a MUST if you are looking for good, basic Italian food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find! We will surely come back. It's very small but packs big flavor. Everyone was really nice and your not paying crazy prices."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We went off yelp reviews and menu Choice last week.  It's a little less pricey than a few of the others in the Venetian.  We were craving good Italian food and got it!  We ordered the ziti and ravioli with cream sauce.  It was superb.  Our server, Sabrador, was fantastic.  He was very attentive and kind.  He recommended a great wine since we all wanted red (diavolo I think) and got us the bottle.  He said he was an assistant server and that the regular server was busy but I'm glad he served us. He deserves a full spot!  The experience turned our night around because we were Ll in a bad mood and hungry.  We left full, a little tipsy and happy.  Keep up the good work Reggiano!"}
{"text":"felt like carb-ing up after a fun-filled memorial day weekend!  This little restaurant was tucked in behind the lobster me stand. There were about 6-8 small tables outside, and 2-3 booths inside. The ambiance was interesting, it was somewhat an authentic italian feel but was off put by the venetian traffic walking by. The staff was attentive but seemed hastened. Nevertheless they were very sweet.   Our noms:  Complimentary Bread: Garlic knots - should have been a bit warmer. I'm a seasoning nazi and I think if they added more seasoning to the dough and added lots of garlic it would be delicious. Outside was very buttery. I took these guys home and baked them and added some garlic seasoning which made them bomb!  Starter: Fried calamari appetizer - Large portion, lightly breaded and fresh tasting. Not bad but not the best i've tried either. Marinara that came with it was warm but strange. I had to add some more s + p + crushed red. I'm starting to think I just have a salty tongue!   Entrees: I can't help but get pasta at every italian restaurant I come across. The man got the spaghetti + filet mignon meatballs. He thought it was OK, but then again we are spoiled by Enoteca Adriano in San Diego's spaghetti and meatballs. (Best i've ever had) For filet mignon meatballs I thought they would be moist and tender, they came out a bit dry. Spaghetti was nothing special.   My entree: linguini w/ shrimp in white sauce. This usually comes with clams but I had a bad experience with eating clams far from a coast. I loooved this. It was light and refreshing. Linguini was perfectly al dente. I finished the entire thing and even mopped up the sauce with some garlic knots. A squeeze of lemon and fresh parmesan made it even better! (refer to picture posted)   All in all, I would come back for the linguini. 3.5! Ohh the struggle of rounding up or down for a 3.5 star place. I'm gonna have to round down because of the boyf's lackluster spaghetti and meatballs. Sorry guys!  Honorable mentions: Olive oil + balsalmic were absolutely delicious. They were obviously imported. Yum.  Note: Pasta dishes ranged from $18-28. $18 being the most basic pastas, so I would say it is almost towards $$$.  Happy eating! xo"}
{"text":"The food was good not great and the service was horrible. The server did not ask for our drink order he just assumed we wanted water. We waited quite a bit to order and for our food but it was a busy time and it didn't bother us. What bothered us was the server never came to check on us once. We had to ask for what we needed. He never even gave us the check, we had to ask some other server for it. The table next to ours ordered lots of alcohol and he gave them lots of attention and was so friendly with them. So I guess you just need to order boos to get good service. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was very very good!! Fast service, super cute and intimate place. Our servers name was Ricki, she was attentive and all. Although they couldn't figure out which tables were their own and what their rotation would be, and there was a little bit of bickering. Other wise they would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"Last day at the Venetian and still had not had any Italian! We asked the conceirge to recommend some good olf fashioned Italian, not too \"foo foo\" and reasonably priced for lunch before we had to head to the airport and he pointed us here saying it was the best. Small little cafe where the tables spill out into the canal shoppes walkway. The garlic knot bread brushed with olive oil and butter and pamesean was a yummy start. We had spaghetti and meatballs made with angus beef filet mignon and a linguine bolognese. Both delicious and filling. Quick service too. The only down side was in sitting out in the open, I kinda felt lots of eyes on me as I ate my pasta (which is hard to be too lady like to do!)"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch on our last day in Vegas. It was not the easiest place to find but we decided to give it a try because of all the positive reviews.  First off the garlic rolls are delicious and they will keep bringing them to your table. We ended up ordering the gnocchi and spaghetti with meatballs. Both dishes were good but nothing special.  The biggest downside of our dinning experience was our waiter. He barely checked on our table. We had to constantly hunt someone down to help us if we needed anything. If the service was better I would have at least given this place 3 stars. With all the other italian restaurants in Vegas I would skip this place and try your luck somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied  about its food. I asked Chicken Marsala, not flavor!!   The lasagna and  meatballs/ too  . It's priced high  for the quality of food.  The location and ambience keep us there. But I would not recommended"}
{"text":"This was a great find. Not as expensive as most of the other restaurants visited but the food and service was great .... especially the service. Very entertaining. We'd go there again."}
{"text":"Difficult to find, and not worth the effort. My cheese tortellini was bland and unexciting. I had to season it and add evoo for any amount of flavor. The meatball app was good, but nothing to write home about. The couple sitting next to us (I was practically sitting in their lap) happened to be loyal patrons. They loved it. We simply didn't."}
{"text":"I loved my meal at Trattoria Reggiano! I ordered the shrimp risotto and although the shrimp were a little tough, the risotto was absolutely delicious. The bread in the basket which came with the meal was soft and delightful. I really regretted leaving it behind, since we were traveling we couldn't take leftovers with us. My dining companion ordered the sea bass and loved it, it was prepared exactly the way he likes it. Our server was lovely and very attentive. I almost passed by this restaurant thinking a meal downtown would not be so great but I'm so glad we didn't. It turned out to be the best meal of our trip and I would highly recommend Trattoria Reggiano."}
{"text":"Best tasting ice water at any restaurant I've ever been to! It did not have that usual nasty tap taste and actually tasted better than any of my favorite bottled waters! I normally drink only half a glass at most at any given restaurant, but I drank 3 glasses here! I wasn't even that thirsty!  We tried the filet mignon meatballs people keep talking about; they were above average but we did not experience the whoa factor. Chicken marsala was also above average and was the best tasting one I've ever had at a restaurant but it wasn't as good as the one my cousin makes. He notes, however, that the sauce was really well made.  The free bread was also pro, predipped in oil and very tasty. The olive oil and vinegar were also very nice.  P.S. Hiep, my cousin, wants to add that the service is excellent. The inside is small but the atmosphere is homely."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars only because of the bar service I have experienced on other occasions which was worth 5 stars... With that being said I would give dining on the patio 2 stars at best. First of all, when I ask about bread and water and the server responds with \"the busser will bring that out soon\" you've already rubbed me the wrong way. Which by the way she brought out 2 minutes later.  The food is very mediocre and overpriced for what it is especially, with Grape Street being across the street at the same price and higher quality.  I had the bolognese- average. The man had what seemed to be a chicken breast and dry pasta couldn't even tell you the name of the dish.  We had to ask for our check and to-go boxes ourselves in an empty restaurant.  Should've just cooked at home."}
{"text":"Wasn't so thrilled with the quality of food. Bread stale and food average. Hyped up because of the Venetian."}
{"text":"Took my friend for her birthday and we also celebrated Mother's Day.  We both agreed that we would come back again!!  She had the Eggplant Parmigiana, which she said was delish and I had the salmon. So deeelish!  My friend doesn't like Salmon but she tried it and  she liked it!!!  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great place!  The food was excellent - my wife had the linguine carbonara which was tasty, but I had the pesto gnocchi which was just superb.  The price was very good as well (considering most other places on the Strip).  The only bad thing here was the wine - I got a bottle of Chianti that was about half our bill but was not good.  I'm giving it a 4 only because of the wine."}
{"text":"This place is good.  Vegas is such a bazaar place. Want to eat outside, inside next to a small river? Visit Trattoria Reggiano.  The pasta carbonara was really delicious and well priced for Vegas. The complimentary garlic bread is very, very tasty."}
{"text":"Made reservations for this place before seeing Rock of Ages at The Venetian. Had decent reviews compared to other Italian restaurants in Vegas, so we decided to give it a try and it was a short walk to the show after.   First off, the place is near impossible to find. We walked around for about 10 minutes before finally stumbling upon it. Since we had made a reservation, we were seated pretty quickly. The service was good at first, but that didn't last too long. Regardless, we got our drinks and meals in a timely manner, but no follow up once anything came out.   The food: They bring you out garlic knots, which were pretty delicious. We ordered the Spaghetti & Meatballs and Linguine Carbonara. The meatballs and sauce were tasty. The Carbonara was a little too oily and didn't actually feel or taste like a true Carbonara.   I would probably return, but would order something different. Reservations are highly recommended as the place was packed!"}
{"text":"First,we love this place,the food is phenomenal. My wife, ordered wine instead got champagne. But it was taking forever just to get water and some bread. So she just went with it. So we had to ask the hostess for bread. Because Andres took FOREVER, We were there for almost 2 hours. Never asked how our food was, we had to ask for refills when we did see our waiter Andres. We also had to ask the hostess for our check then that took over 20 mins just to get that. We are so disappointed, our girls didn't even get the cannolis that they usually get after there meals. On a side note the food was great. We watched people leave because no one ever came over to at least get there drink order. I don't know if we will be back, this was our favorite for Italian but maybe have to loom somewhere else."}
{"text":"great Italian food in a comfortable environment. great friendly service."}
{"text":"The good: Staff is great, super friendly and attentive. Food is really good, not great but you would be a complete food snob if you thought it was bad. Decent wine selection.  The bad: Small location in a high traffic area. Not good for privacy, romance or intimate conversation. Overall: If you're staying at the Venetian, shopping, or at the Sands Convention Center, this place is worth checking out. If you have an appetite definitely order the meatballs app."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really given me a standard for review s and quality food at an affordable priced restaurant..My husband and I came in sometime around 2:30 on a tues for a late lunch. I had been debating with myself for a couple days (I am truly such a foodie) as I often do. If I'm going to spend the money I want above average food. Well I am so glad my husband and I came here while in vegas..The service was spectacular ,everyone was very accommodating and helpful,they kept drinks filled and brought extra bread and croutons without a hint of complaint or frustration..On to the location although inside the Venetian cobblestone shopping area the restaurant is open and it is in a busy area near the food court behind lobster me and so while the restaurant itself is very nice it can become an incredibly loud meal with all the bypasses( this I would say would be the only real issue. On to the food,wow my taste buds were awakened with exciting flavors,I so wish I could give this place a 10 star review. They start u out with from scratch Gaelic knots and they don't cheap out on seasoning and flavor. They were so epic that when they brought the arugula Caesar salad with truffle oil I had a hard time putting the bread down which I can say rarely if ever happens . When I finally came out of bread coma I bit into the salad and more amazing flavors,the truffle oil complements the lemon flavor in the caesar dressing..with anchovies on top,perfect amount of dressing this salad I would give a 10 out of 10 if I could absolute food perfection. And know we get to the lobster ravioli ,I am not usually a huge fan of tomatoey sauces(I  aware that's not a word) how ever the creamy tomatoes sauce on this was heaven,the pack the ravioli in beautiful flavor and an amazing amount of lobster and the precede to puns on loads more on top of the ravioli.i give this what I wish could be 11 out of 10.   So case in pint you are missing out if you don't come here while on vegas,the price is great and the food is out of this world amazing.. I have eaten at very expensive restaurants and not come out this ecstatic and happy.. I haven't been able to stop talking about it. And knowing me I will be coming back soon even though it's a four hr dr from Southern California.."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time tonight. We have gone to many other places in Vegas and this was by far the best. Dora and Reilly made the whole dining experience even better. Dora recommended the eggplant rollatini appetizer. I don't usually order that in a restaurant. It was the best eggplant I have had. We had chicken Parmesan, chicken francese, mussels, pasta fagioli, penne vodka and an amazing chocolate cake. The portions were huge and delicious. This is a must if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Trattoria Reggiano is my new favorite Italian restaurant.   BEST SHRIMP SCAMPI EVER! They coated the shrimp with bread crumbs. The sauce was not greasy at all because it had a hint of fresh lemon juice. I devoured it!   The meatballs were very juicy and the meat sauce was great. The meatballs are actually a mix of filet minion and pork.   The spaghetti and meat sauce was great as usual. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented it very well.   The atmosphere was great and I loved the live music during dinner time. The service was very good and our server made sure to ask us and the tables around how the food was. He also made sure to keep our water filled which I know is something minor but it shows they are paying attention to our table."}
{"text":"The Food is Amazingly unreal  . Sergio is amazing! We love him so much . The service was amazing we enjoyed it so much and we enjoy Sergio so much . We had a unforgettable dinner and we had a awesome experience. Ask for Sergio her makes everything so much better !"}
{"text":"Decided to come here since I didn't want to be eating Grand Luxe Cafe every meal being that we were situated at the Venetian. Place is super close to the regular suites in the Venetian or Palazzo. Located inside the grand canale shops, the place is actually pretty small. Large groups might take time for them to accommodate without reservations.   I had the lobster rav which was pretty bomb. Sauce was tasty but wasn't overly heavy and lobster chunks were meaty. Also had a bite of the spaghetti meatball. It was bomb too. I think I had a small bite of some other stuff and just remember everything being bomb. Including the unlimited garlic knots. Holy shit they are good. Just remember to triple rinse your mouth with listerine if you're clubbing later.  If you even remotely enjoy a good pasta and aren't trying to break the bank, come to this place. Also the manager talked like super mario. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"I had baked ziti & the wife ordered the meat balls. Ziti was good, nothing fantastic. Balls were ok. We had the balls at Little Tony's in Palace Station the week before & they were great. We'll try something else next time we're there & give them another chance."}
{"text":"A small restaurant in a nice casino (Venetian). Great service and very delicious entres. We had the penne primavera and the lobster ravioli, and we both \"licked\" our plates clean :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of colleagues and overall enjoyed the experience.  We ordered burrata and calamari for the table which was good - not the best I've ever had but still tasty. However the bread they gave before the meal was delicious, I had to stop myself from eating more.  I ordered the carbonara as my entree and thought it was fine. Its obviously a very heavy dinner and was good but it's not something I came away from thinking \"wow, I need to have that again.\" However everyone at the table all really liked their dishes so I'd go back and try something different  They portions are generous and almost no one finished their meals.   One thing I didn't like was the atmosphere. The restaurant is completely open to the mall with a small gate closing it in and tries to give a neighborhood-esque feel. However, the amount of foot traffic and noise outside the restaurant really doesn't allow for that."}
{"text":"This place was great! I did have trouble finding it, but that turned out to be half the charm- it was so nice to eat in a relaxed, quiet environment. The prices were high, but not ridiculously so- I had the Spaghetti Carbonara, a glass of the house pinot grigio, and tiramisu for $50 including tip. The food tasted excellent. Their bread, which was lightly garlicky, drizzled with olive oil and parmesan, was great. They set some very nice olive oil and balsamic on your table for you to dip it in. My only complaint- I ate there alone, and they seated another couple directly beside me despite other tables being open. Overall, I look forward to eating there again!"}
{"text":"A trattoria is an Italian-style eating establishment, less formal than a ristorante, but more formal than an osteria. There are generally no printed menus, the service is casual, wine is sold by the decanter rather than the bottle, prices are low, and the emphasis is on a steady clientele rather than on haute cuisine.  The above is Wikipedia's definition of a trattoria.  Some of it fits what we experienced at Downtown Summerlin Reggiano.  I'll start with the positive.  At the end of our ordeal Danny the manager refused our payment with apologies.  It would have been about $200. I did tip accordingly.  It was a birthday celebration and our small party of three chose to try something new that a trusted friend raved about, Trattoria Reggiano.  We had reservations and we were seated promptly.  But I should have guessed what was to come when our table, covered with the traditional sheet of meat wrapper, came with a can of crayons.  Our attentive server (Dan, not the manager) was prompt and pleasant. He brought menus which are printed with impossibly small print.  He took our drink orders (wine, martini and water) and soon returned with a basket of the wonderful garlic buns.  Fifteen minutes later, still no beverages.    We were seated near the bar and I could see the person behaving like a bartender wondering about the trattoria, bussing tables and socializing with the foursome at the table next to ours.  I could also see Dan giving her furtive glances to see where the drink order was.  He feared returning to our table because he knew we would also ask.  In the meantime a woman brough her very young daughter to the bar area and said, \"Wouldn't you like to sit on the stool that (famous Golden Knights hockey player) sat in the other night?\"  Hey, isn't there a law prohibiting minors from sitting in a bar area?  As a bartender or manager I would be nervous about risking my permit over such an infraction, I don't care if you are the Duchess of Summerlin.  In the meantime the bussers would come around the corner with a load of dirty dishes, silverware and glasses which then would be unceremoniously dumped with an accompanying cacophony of disturbing noise.  I'm European and I can tell you that such behavior in Italy would have been the cause of immediate dismissal of that employee.  Finally, Dan came over, apologized for the slow cocktail service and pressed the barmaid to produce our order.  The water came first followed soon by the glass of wine and my martini.  I ordered a martini up.  It was in a stemmed glass, but it had ice cubes in it.  Hello?????  I passed it off as sloppy pouring and said nothing.  By this time we had put in our entree order and waited...and waited...and waited.  I ordered another martini.  It was served identically only with more ice cubes.  Not the way I have ever had a chocolate espresso martini.  More than an hour after entering the premises it occurred to me that the can of crayons were there to help pass the time.  Maybe some doodling, hangman, anything to take our minds of our growling tummies.  I must say that the food is prepared in generous proportions.  Our order included a Caesar Salad and Dan advised wisely, that one order would feed two and offered to split it on two plates.  It came on one and we did the honors.  My pasta dish with meatballs lasted two additional meals after take out.  The food was slightly on the bland side.  In the meantime, I observed Dan and the other working server (only two for the whole place).  He was quite industrious working his tables but the holdup in the kitchen made that a challenge.  His serving associate however, was another story.  She would disappear for lengthy periods.  Twice I watched her go out the front door to talk on her cell phone while customers were waiting for service.  I'm assuming she was mining for another job.  After nearly two hours we just wanted to get out of there and none of us finished our food.  Took awhile to wave down Dan for the check and the to go containers.  He apologized for the slow service and we acknowledged his apology by briefly expressing our disappointment.  He asked if \"The Birthday Boy\" would be interested in a dessert.  This was the fourth time he used that moniker with me and my 71-year-old child within was about ready to bop him one.  I just said, \"no\".  Soon after Danny the manager came back with our check and  acknowledging that they had staffing issues.  He assured me when I asked that my drinks should not have been served over ice.  When it was obvious that even when offered a free meal we would never be back, he withdrew the check.  Kudos to him.  There are too many good places in this town to put up with that kind of service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at the Summerlin mall which makes it a very convenient location after a long day of shopping. In the summer time the ambiance is even better as you can sit on the outside patio. The price point is reasonable, you can find several dishes priced from 18 to 40 dollars per plate.   They also have a large selection of items so there is not an issue finding anything you would like. The size portions were very generous, I would say most people would have a hard time finishing their plate. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli which was very good. There were large pieces of lobster all over the dish. The sauce was tasty and the ravioli was perfectly cooked.   If you are looking for a simple but tasty dish I would recommend this dish. Overall, the food was good but not memorable."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after a day of shopping, it was the first time for both of us. We had a wonderful server by the name of Ricki - we weren't sure what to order and she recommended the lobster ravioli which was what we both ordered and it was fantastic. We then had to have some dessert and our server Ricki recommended her favorite- tiramisu- well now it is my favorite!! So glad we decided to check out this place - will definitely be returning when Ricki is working and asking for her recommendations again!"}
{"text":"So many amazing things about this spot! Let's start with the quaint location. It isn't some huge chain Italian restaurant. It's a small spot with inside and outside seating (of course, the outside is still technically inside since it's in the Venetian.) We were seated immediately and multiple servers greeted us and made sure we were taken care of. I ordered the special: cheese ravioli with roasted tomato marinara and fresh buffalo mozzarella. INCREDIBLE. My husband had the pesto gnocchi--also incredible!! The garlic rolls that came out before our entrees were delicious. They were warm and cheesy and served with balsamic vinegar and oil. Our meal, start to finish, took no longer than 40 minutes. I was impressed by the service, the food, and the whole experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant was soo good. Just randomly stopped in and it was Amazing! My sister and I got salmon and arugula salad (best salad I have ever had) and Shrimp scampi and we shared both. The linguine and sauce were so good. The sauce was light so it did not feel heavy like an Alfredo sauce. The shrimp was not cooked that well and that's the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. It was super crowded but the service was still great. Never had an empty drink which is a big plus. My daughter had spaghetti and she could not e happier."}
{"text":"Our meal was delicious! We ordered spaghetti pomodoro and chicken Francese with a mozzarella caprese starter. The entries were perfectly prepared. I will dream about those flavors! The ricotta cheesecake was incredible! Our server, Victor was terrific. Great experience!"}
{"text":"First time here. Amazing food and Bethany at the bar is awesome! Great service and food recommendations. There was a live musician on guitar who was amazing. My wife and I are still here having a wonderful night. Thank you trattoria reggianno!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday with a friend.  It was my first visit.  I am a fan.  We shared a pizza, it was a very generous in size.  And very tasty!  But, what I really want to rave about is the service  we received from everyone.  The server, the bartender, the host were outstanding.  They have a lovely outside seating area with coolers so we were not hot at all.  A big thumbs up, can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Hard to find unless you know it is right at the end of the food court.  Great food and value.  Service was fantastic.  The place actually has expanded, it has plenty of seating.  You won't go away hungry."}
{"text":"We've been to Trattoria three times recently and have been so happy every time! The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly and really helpful! Plus the restaurant is nice and the patio is nice as well.  I called on the phone to make a reservation and Angie was really nice and kind, and when we went in, she was just as sweet in person when she was greeting the guests and seating them. The manager Daniel was very, very nice and friendly as well. Our servers were great and very helpful (I have a food allergy so I had some questions), and I really appreciated it!  We can't wait to go back again! :)"}
{"text":"haha 4 stars? is that a joke?   I ordered their pasta w/ pink vodka sauce. I could've made a better pasta than them and i'm culinarily challenged!!  As most reviewers have noted, this place offers bread that looks hot, but is actually served cold. Should've been my first red flag to dash outta there. The price is expensive for the quantity of food as well. My friend finished her linguine w/ clams in two bites.   I would suggest a local olive garden if you're looking for a better italian restaurant- at least their breadsticks come out warm."}
{"text":"We sat at the table, after a reservation, for 20 min before the waiter even considered taking our order. He gave us a no for almost every drink we wanted saying his mixer was not working! Me and my husband had different prices on the menu, and the server shrugged it off saying we'll see what the system says when we put in the bill!! Bad food! We ordered an eggplant appetizer and an eggplant parmesan. Both dishes were way too oily and soggy and just not worth eating. Both dishes were very evidently reheated and given to us.  We left half of our food on plate and the server did not even bother to ask why. Most horrible service and food I've ever had, and believe me I've had my bad share of both!"}
{"text":"In Vegas and was short on time, hit the food court in the Venetian and found this diamond. The service was GREAT (pleasant and fast) and the food was AMAZING? The fillet mignon and pork meatballs were the bomb and the broccoli rabe was perfect... Ciao Bella"}
{"text":"You can't find a bad place to eat inside the Venetian if you tried.  Our host/waiter was great. Very informative. Very knowledgeable. Almost felt like he owned the place.   The prices were fair in comparison to most of Las Vegas. Dinner for two (no drinks) was about $35-40.  Complimentary bread with oil and vinaigrette.  Great pasta dishes. Pizza was pretty good too. If I ever go back, I would stick to pasta for sure. Pasta outshines the pizza."}
{"text":"I loved this place! If we go back to Vegas, we will definitely stop here. It's small, but the food was good. My fiance ordered the \"personal\" pizza, but it could have easily fed three of us!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I ordered the peanut kale salad and the margherita pizza, and I tried their grilled salmon. I loved the atmosphere, but service could've been better. The downtown summerlin location always has better service. It's important to make reservations for the place because they are always busy, but well worth it"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch this afternoon!!! After a dietary concern, our waitress said she'd speak with the manager to see if they could accommodate us. Daniel the manager was very happy to oblige!! The food was excellent and we ate it before thinking to take a picture. My friend had a lemon something martini, which was excellent, and a kale peanut salad. I had chicken parmesan. Daniel checked on us several times to make sure everything was just right. The ambience was quaint, the staff friendly and personable and the food very good.  Excellent place for a date night or a casual girls afternoon outing!"}
{"text":"Yelp needs more stars!!  Omg! This place is so amazing I am reviewing from my honeymoon!! We were at \"tickets for tonight \" getting tickets for Rock of Ages, and a worker suggested this place, as both are in the Venetian.. They had a voucher for half off 2 entrees, so we went through the maze that us Venetian and found TR. Delicious Caesar salad, filet minion meatballs, pasta bolognese, veal parm. Unreal! Just as good or better than some places back home in NYC. Lots of dishes made with San Marzano tomatoes. Sooo good! Huge portions, took leftovers back to the hotel! Cappuccino and the best tiramisu we ever had. Very friendly staff. Victor took good care of us. Will def be back before we leave LV. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Small place but the food is amazing! Our entire party agreed this was the best food we have had in Vegas. We are not ones to eat at high dollar places that are more than 30 dollars for an entree. Didn't have to wait at all and service was prompt. All meatballs and meat in sauces is filet mignon and those were the best meatballs I have ever had in my life. My only grip is the price for beverages like soda and it is not fountain but just small glass bottles. I assumed no refills but I didn't ask. Enjoyed my Pepsi and water. Beer is the same as everywhere else. Either drink water or be willing to pay. I will have to eat here every time I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"basic italian food. nothing new nor special. i ate it though and was happy and full. probably wouldnt go back. the garlic rolls that come with your meal are the bomb though!"}
{"text":"Best advice is to avoid Italian (fake) places in Vegas. We ordered marsala, baked ziti, linguine bolognese, bruschetta pizza.... and it all tasted like food you might barf up after a drunk night on the strip... Well, that is, after you washed it off in the sink.  I'm serious. It tastes like you washed it with water. And in the $20 price range.. where you could make this all at home with no experience for $1-2, they are sheistering you big time.  We were a group of four, and our server was hesitant to give us seconds on the bread rolls... which by the way I recognized as frozen Pillsbury dough boy dinner rolls  covered in butter and garlic powder salt (not even real butter).. it tasted chemical-ly.  Another in our group recognized some of the flavors as Stouffer's frozen food.   This review is written by native Los Angelinos New Yorkers and Europeans... maybe our expectations are too high.  You'd have better luck eating next door at Grand Luxe Cafe. I guarantee your food will be better there, even though that's a chain. After all, this is a fake boutique Italian restaurant in an indoor shopping mall."}
{"text":"The service was excellent.   Rikki did a great job.  Started with Eggplant Rolotini.  Moved on to Pasta Fagioli.   Both excellent  Veal Marsala for the entrees.  Very tender and generous portions of pasta.  Ricotta Cheesecake and Cannoli for dessert. Again. Very fresh and delicious.  Very impressed.  Will return."}
{"text":"This is high end for the mall restaurants here, but the nice decor and friendly staff outweigh the food and service. Unfortunately, it's one of those places where they notice your water glass is empty and refill it after you finish your meal and drank 3/4 of the water from the person next to you.   My friend kept trying to ask the server questions and ordering but the server kept walking off where she was getting pretty frustrated. The place was 3/4 full maybe but not overly busy as it was already 7:30.  The whole table heard me ask for shrimp scampi since they had to come back to take my order, except our server so when the food came out I stared at it and thought these are either mighty big shrimp (the menu did say jumbo shrimp) or I got chicken. I ask the server to double check and said server apologized and insisted in making it right. It came out in 6 min. It was fast. I got 6 jumbo shrimp...maybe I should've told them to take their time and cook it for 12 minutes (to get 12 shrimp).  Shrimp was fine but it was overpowered by this stuffing placed on top which was salty and totally out of place. The shrimp was simply overpowered in this case.  The appetizers of calamari and cheese and olives were very good though. The mozzarella pizza was ok but it certainly is no Grimaldis or even Pieology. Yes, I would gladly take the pieology pizza. The pizza is thin slice but the tomato flavor is not there. It can use more sauce or tomato paste. The next day when I reheated it it was soggy due to to much water from the cheese. The lobster ravioli was very good.  It does not stack up against the middle ground Cheesecake Factory in my view. The service is friendly but lacking. For $300 for a group of 7 (not including the bar tab) it was nothing to write home about. Very disappointed as the place looked like a really nice place."}
{"text":"This was good, not life changing, but good Italian. My wife had Lobster Ravioli. It was very rich, creamy, w/ a good amount of Lobster. I had the Veal Milanese. It was HUGE! Veal was hanging off the plate. The Arugula Salad piled on top was fantastic. Slightly over cooked, the Veal was very tasty but a touch dry. The ambiance of this place feels like a mall because it's just off of the Grande Canal shopping area and near a food court. I wouldn't go here for a special occasion or date night, but it's a GREAT spot for casual dining or a little respite from gambling and shopping."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was great as well. It is rare to find a place in Vegas that has quality food at a decent price!"}
{"text":"Overall very good experience. The food was good and the service was great. Off the beaten path and not overhyped like some of the \"big name\" restaurants that are pumped up but then result in a letdown."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my boyfriend for what we thought would be a light-ish meal. As always, our tummies were too small for our ravenous appetites, so we ordered a tad bit too much food. Nonetheless, everything tasted great and we had a good time! We stopped by around 2 pm on a Saturday and the place was basically empty. As a result, we were able to snag a comfy booth and our server was really attentive throughout our meal.  I knew I needed to check this place out because they have filet mignon meatballs. Yup, you read that right. Filet mignon meatballs. My boyfriend and I got an order each (three meatballs for $18) and split a dish of chicken marsala ($26). The filet mignon meatballs tasted as heavenly as they sound. Juicy, flavorful, and tender; just how a meatball should be. We originally ordered the chicken marsala dish on the side to share since we figured three meatballs wouldn't be able to fill us. However, these meatballs were huge! After finishing one of my meatballs, I felt like I already ate three. I ended up unfortunately wasting one of my meatballs since the Venetian doesn't have a refrigerator or microwave in any of their rooms :( Nonetheless, this is a solid 5 out of 5 star dish and potentially my favorite meal I had in Vegas.  The chicken marsala was decent, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Everything was cooked nicely - the chicken was moist, the mushrooms had a nice amount of chew to them, and the noodles were perfectly al dente - but compared to the filet mignon meatballs, this dish just fell a little flat. It also didn't help that I was already stuffed to the brim once this dish came out!   Other smaller notes: - The complementary garlic bread is delicious. It's super soft and they definitely don't skimp out on the garlic butter spread. If you're looking for a cheap, delicious, and filling meal on the strip, I'd just order the filet mignon meatballs for $18 and stuff yourself with yummy free bread. - My boyfriend ordered a mint mojito from here and he rates it as the best drink he had during our trip to Vegas. - Prices are cheaper at lunch compared to dinner if you're looking to save a little bit of cash!"}
{"text":"The service and the ambiance I would rate at 4 stars. You step into this place and you can almost forget that you are in the midst of the artificial decadence called Vegas. It has a very authentic feel to it and the owners seem to be Italians.   Tried the seafood spaghetti and asked for a white wine sauce instead of tomato sauce. The seafood and spaghetti itself was good, but the sauce was watery and added no flavor to the pasta."}
{"text":"To start let me say we found our new local favorite!  We recently found this little gem after seeing a movie at Downtown Summerlin.  We plan on visiting for dinner prior to our future date night at the movies.  The restaurant is literally right next door to the theater.  Service is top notch!  We started with a drink at the bar so we would have a chance to look at the menu.  The bartender was very gracious and answered our questions about their specialty drinks and wines.  After looking at the menu we decided to have dinner and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was right there to greet us and answered our menu questions.  He also asked if we were seeing a movie so he could time our dinner if necessary.  I ordered my fave, eggplant parm which was awesome.  Perfectly cooked and not loaded with cheese.  My better half had a kale salad which was actually very good.  I rarely order healthy dishes but may rethink this as the salad had a great dressing and was a nice change from the standard caesar.  The manager Vito stopped by twice to check in on us and offered us a complimentary plate of olives and cheese which was a nice touch which you rarely see these days.  My only complaint is the lack of restrooms.  They only have one unisex restroom which is located in a busy hallway so it was bit awkward with a couple of us waiting in line.  I have already recommended it to friends so I would give it try.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We found this hidden gem of a restaurant from Yelp. Let me just say that the food and service was top notch!!! If we had more time we would have eaten here everyday! My husband and I ordered the baked ziti, spaghetti pomodoro, and the pasta e Fabiola soup. All delicious!!! At the end of the meal, my husband had the hand pressed coffee, which he said was delicious. This food is worth every penny!!!!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed.  Advertising as an authentic Italian eatery. Shame.  The pizza we had, tasted like it was just pulled from the freezer aisle.  Dough was bland and not very good eats.  Beware all.  Go to the lobster shack next door and save your mulla."}
{"text":"We had a great waiter I didn't catch his name but we had the manager just make our restaurant dining experience so nice his name was Ben Martinez food was good liked everything except the Ceaser salad."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with authentic Italian food. Olive oil and vinegar imported from Italy. The filet mignon meatballs are a must as is the Pasta e Fagioli soup. The spaghetti bolognese and the pizzas are great as well. Very friendly and attentive service. They don't take reservations so go early."}
{"text":"It was late and we were about the go out and wanted to grab a bite to eat. So we came here, I ordered the standard spaghetti and meatballs and my friend got the pizza. I would have to say... for ordinary spaghetti and meatballs, with meatballs being made from ground filet, it was so soft, it melted like butter in your mouth haha. The pizza wasn't as crispy as we wanted it. But this place got an extra star because the owner came up and talked to us after dinner and asked us how everything was. This place is a bit pricey but it is the Venetian so you have to expect that a bit."}
{"text":"$$. It's more like $$$ with meh food and no service to speak with!  We arrived there at prime time 7pm without reservation, was told about 20mins wait even though there were a few tables. They were good enough to have texting service when table is available so we could roam around in the cancel shops.   After being seated, service was slow from start to beginning!  Food was not good at all   $25 for clam linguine, $16 for 3 filet migon meatball (nothing special as expected), $22 chicken Parmesan.  Portion was average only. For this kind of money, I had to eat at table spilled over to the outside, bad service. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday for a quick dinner before hitting the club.   I was pretty impressed. Their meatballs are delicious made with filet mignon meat, however if you really like Alfredo sauce like me... don't skip out on the Alfredo Tortellini like I did! Big mistake!!!   Good thing my friend had ordered it, it was soooooo good. It looks small in the pictures and in real life, but you must remember you do get unlimited garlic rolls which pair really well together. And what kind of Italian dinner would be complete without some calamari???  Our server was insanely nice and accommodating as well.   This place was just a bit hard to find. I think the shops at Venetian are so confusing... I had to ask 3 people for directions before I found it. Just look for Lobster Me and the Magic Shop, this place is right between."}
{"text":"Was looking for affordable Italian on the Strip and I'm so glad we chose this place.  I know people said it was small, but it was TINY.  Looks like they're getting ready to expand, which is great because the food was fantastic.  Everyone in  our party loved what they got.  The meatballs were great, the Parmigiana was great, my son loved his Scampi as well as the cake he had for dessert.  And the prices were better than at many (much worse) places I've been in LV.  Hope this place stays put...  can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food and the service were both excellent!! I had spaghetti & meatballs and my husband had the veal, and everything was just delicious. Our server was super nice, and we had a lovely experience all around. The place may not look like much from the outside, but it's cute and reasonably priced and a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Wait a minute people - 5 STARS for this??? Uhmmmm...I think the 5 stars are a TAD bit over-rated.  The food was good, it was fine, and I was hungry but no way would I put this as 5 STAR Italian food. This makes me wonder about some of you and what your 'worst Italian food' is like.  Anyways, the restaurant is tiny and they don't take reservations.  We weren't inside the restaurant but were seated \"outside\".  It made me think that I was in the overflow  The filet mignon meatballs are good but I wouldn't rave about this place as if it's better than Scalini Fedeli in NYC.  Garlic bread was overhyped and I thought this place was okay - I have absolutely experienced better than this but I still think this was okay."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning there last night. Have eaten there before and thought the food was so-so, but never expected to get food poisoning. Threw up 4 times. Had eaten the salmon. Definitely will not be going back. A friend of mine told me her husband got sick there as well. They really need to change what they're doing. The place lacks a \"uniqueness vibe\" and the food is not commensurate with the prices. Out of all the places to go and eat, I can't imagine they'll survive with the quality they're producing."}
{"text":"Easily the best meal I enjoyed in Vegas this past week. I was on a vacation with my sisters. Knowing we would be eating out for 6 days we tried to keep the budget in check. This restaurant was recommended by a friend of my sister did not disappoint as far as the food was concerned. It is tucked away in the back of the food court. Location isn't great...I suppose that is how they keep the prices down. \"Outdoor tables\" are actually inside. Lighting in the interior of the restaurant is way too bright. Service was very average...our waiter was a hyper-macho Italiano who kept himself busy fawning over the young girls eating next to us, and chatting with his buddies out in the food court plaza. At the end of our meal he was so carried away with his buddies that he had totally forgotten about us, and need to be retrieved by a bus boy.  The Caeser Salad that we shared was good. Filet mignon meatballs with spaghetti and red sauce were delicious, as was the wood-fired Quatro Stagioni pizza. I highly recommend the food...the service not so much."}
{"text":"My family and I dined there July 8th for lunch. the food and service were fantastic!  Our server Victor, seated us right away and helped us chose our appetizers and entrees.  He was very pleasant and knowledgeable. With his help we chose the perfect amount of food.  He brought us the most deliciously warm seasoned rolls that we had to have a second serving. We ordered calamari, ceasar salad, chicken parmigian, shrimp with linguini in a marinara sauce.  My family loved all of it! We're from NYC where there is no shortage of good Italian restaurants so we have a pretty good idea about what good Italian food should taste like.  Did I mention the rolls???? We ordered pretty standard stuff and they executed these dishes to perfection.  Victor took care of us by being very attentive and predicting our every need. My only regret was not having enough room for dessert. For 5 of us the bill was $90 including tip, a steal! Remember this is the venetian palazzo complex where restaurants can make your wallet cry all the way to the bank.  When I go back to Las Vegas, I'm definitely going back for round 2, this time with a little extra hunger to squeeze in dessert."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST Italian food in Vegas! ! !  My boyfriend & I went on a Monday for lunch, there was no wait. Our server Lyndsay was AWESOME!  The bread was amazing.... our entrees chicken parmigiano & linguine shrimp with marinara sauce was also AMAZING! The prices were good for Vegas. I will definitely grab a bite to eat here whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hilda our server was on point and knowable of the wine list. Spaghetti with meatballs was perfectly hot. Red sauce was just about perfect and not a mushroom in site,bits of garlic and see through onions. The wine was Bon Anno, Nappa Valley price at $50.00 a bottle. Antipasto, roasted and marinated red, yellow bell peppers,olives green,red and black and perfect hard cheese. The bread was a type of hard roll pretzel type. It did lack butter in the baking process. The double dark chocalate cake was perfect not overly sweet. Coffee was average but doable. I would have gave a 5 stars but the rolls bread gave it a 4."}
{"text":"its in the Venetian. Daughter and I felt like pasta with Bolognese sauce. well, I think we came to the right place, this was incredible. and the portion was perfect for slipping.  We split a salad, some wine and pasta and we were stuffed.  very good food. Would like to actually come back and try other items on the menu that looked good.  our dining neighbors had the wood fired pizza that looked and smelled amazing."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 5 stars. Excellent setting, both times I've been there's live music, and he's actually good. They have these fucking off the hook garlic knots that are literally the best things ever, THAT THEY GIVE YOU FOR FREE. The food, while some may be a tad expensive, is amazing in every aspect; presentation, taste, freshness, etc...  And honestly, the absolute best part, is the service. The waiters are the fucking shit. Dined last night with Hilda, I believe, and she's amazing. Super accommodating, I'm an asshole that modifies everything, and she had an answer for every question I had.  Believe the hype. Way dank."}
{"text":"Meatball!!!!!  Very small restaurant, and very hard to find.  But, one of the best Italian restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Cute Italian restaurant in downtown Summerlin. I believe there is a location on the strip as well but I like this location better.  It has outdoor seating but since it's winter we opted to sit inside. There is a bar inside and as well as an open kitchen.  I started with a glass of wine. The waiter was very helpful in picking a glass of wine. I told him I was ordering penne al vodka and he suggested a red pinot. It was a great pairing! The pasta was also good.  Dessert was, of course, my favorite. We ordered tiramisu and it was the best tiramisu I have ever had. If you order dessert you must try this one.  The prices were moderate. Not overly expensive but not cheap. The service was good but we did have to wait a little while at the end of the check. Overall a good experience. My pick for best Italian in downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"By FAR the worst meal I've eaten in Las Vegas. I ordered a salad and the bolognese. My husband, the pizza. Salad was dull and the bolognese was completely bland. No developed, rich flavor. Just ordinary, cheap quality ingredients. I even tried my husbands pizza--nothing special. This place was highly recommended, but I will never go back."}
{"text":"Found this Italian restaurant on Yelp. We were looking for something within walking distance of the Wynn, so made a reservation.  When we arrived at 6:30, there were only a few patrons dining.  My first instinct was to cancel and go somewhere else, but thought what the heck, the reviews were 4 stars.  The restaurant is situated near the Welcome to Las Vegas gift shop at the Venetian.  Not a nice view of anything, but I was hopeful that the food would be outstanding.  Fail.  Not awful, but definitely not worth a rating above average at best.  Even the bread knots weren't special."}
{"text":"Never fails, the food here is beyond delicious. Words cannot express the quality of the food as well as the service. I always get the Linguini Bolognese or the Chicken Parmigiana. Good selection of wine and other drinks and the rolls of warm bread served with olive oil and vinegar are amazing."}
{"text":"Nope.  My girlfriend and I were at The Venetian and came into Trattoria Reggiano after browsing on Yelp for a bit. Reason? It has a solid 4 stars the gf was craving Calamari and I hadn't had spaghetti and meatballs in a long time.  Upon arrival we stood at the hosts' podium waiting to be seated the hostess was busy looking around and up at the ceiling so I gave her a minute... then I asked for a table for 2.   I get the feeling we'd still be standing there had I not said anything.   I'm unsure what our server sounds like because the only word she muttered was \"sure\" when I asked for both the calamari and spaghetti to be served at the same time.  She literally did not say ANYTHING else. Not when I asked for a refill not when I said thank you as she dropped off the check... nothing.   The food was mediocre.   The service was horrendous.   The star given is for the aged balsamic and complementary garlic knots... but mostly the balsamic. It was really good. I mean, they didn't make it but they had it? Idk. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The garlic bread was too doughy for me.  However their mussels and linguini were delicious.  The portions are more than plentiful.  Hubs enjoyed his spaghetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"After walking by this restaurant many times over the years, we stopped in for a late lunch. We opted for a booth to avoid the traffic flow outside the place and people fresh off their highs from the oxygen bar around the corner.  Food was excellent (we both had the carbonara), portions were generous, and service was amicable and sincere - from the host to the server to the multiple staff members that thanked us on our way out. Definitely an experience we'd repeat."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian feel to this great restaurant!  Pizza and the breadsticks are great"}
{"text":"Great little place near the food court in the canal shops.  Service was great and staff was very accommodating.  Excellent wood fired pizzas and salads.  Solid good in a casual environment.  Would definitely  return."}
{"text":"Starting off with the good.  The service was amazing!  I read the reviews before my husband and I picked a place to eat.  We wanted Italian and this got great reviews, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.    If you have been to Vegas before then you know that eating in the middle of the Venetian shops might not be the most romantic dinner.  Yes the restaurant is small.  So small that you are seated basically in the middle of all the tourists.  I think they want you to feel like you are in Italy sitting outside in a European cafe, but this is Vegas!    Food:  We ordered the meatballs that everyone raved about and they were so acidic that I couldn't even get 2 bits down before the heart burn started.  They aren't the hearty meat taste you might imagine.  They are made with Filet Mignon so they are just bland.  Then we had Linguine with Clams.  It was like water and the noodles were starchy.  We stopped ordering after those things, paid the bill and got pizza late night.    I wish we would have gone to a buffet...."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  Vegas is expensive, so if you are watching your dollars - we found this place on Yelp! allowing us to make the right decision to eat here vs the other many Italian restaurants and we feel we got great value.  VENUE & SERVICE:  Cute restaurant and our server was really friendly.  You are right in The Venetian close to everything so it made for a good pit stop.  BREAD: We appreciated the garlic knots and they even asked us if we wanted more but we had ordered enough food.  MENU: Lots of choice and prices were reasonable. Big portions - great if you are hungry and great if you like to take home leftovers. (We were both.)  We got:  - Meat balls - Baked ziti  - Linguine bolognese  In hind site, we could have got the baked ziti with the meat balls since we were sharing food. But if you are more than two people, get this appy for 3 large meatballs.  With all that we were stuffed, so we didn't try any dessert.  AND BONUS (for us)... we took home leftovers that got us through two other meals. Our hotel had a kitchen, so I was able to transform leftovers into a second slightly different big meal with some items picked up at the local market.  Awesome - that's important to me :) that's good value!  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Just okay, we made a reservation for 7 of us on a weekday night, and it was full when we arrived. We all shared the filet mignon/pork meatball, and I ordered the pesto gnocchi. Pesto sauce was very creamy but not too flavorful, and the gnocchi itself was pretty good. The meatball didn't taste too special but it was quite chewy and it was very tender. Complementary bread was good too, especially with olive oil and vinegar. Price is very high for the quantity though."}
{"text":"After perusing the Yelp reviews of Italian eateries in Las Vegas, the hubby and I decided to give this place a try on a recent trip there.  I'm pretty sure this place makes it money on their wine and alcoholic beverages because I was all geared up for a glass of champagne until I discovered that the only brand of champagne they carry had a price tag of over $100.00 a glass (I believe it was actually $130.00!), and I seem to recall the cheapest glass of wine being somewhere in the vicinity of $13.00!  O.k., so I settled for water and a cappaccino (sp?) as an after-dinner drink!    We ordered their \"greens\" salad ($13.00) and it was gigantic, so plenty for the both of us to share.  For our entrees, I had their baked ziti ($18.00) and the hubs ordered his usual favorite, lasagna (same price).  The baked ziti was a very generous serving, but the lasagna looked kind of lonely on the plate, so hubby downed what remained of my entree after devouring his lasagna.  They were both very, very good but I was disappointed in the sauce, which was a light, pale, almost pinkish color.  I was thinking it was maybe either a vodka sauce or pomodoro, but the waiter told us they mix ricotta into their marinara sauce; hence, the paler sauce.  I'm not a huge fan of ricotta outside of it being contained in ravioloi or layering it in lasagna.  I prefer my Italian sauce deep, dark red and rich, so this took away from the dish for me, but that is just my own personal preference.  There were large layers of melted mozzarella covering the baked ziti, which was delish!  Now for the best thing at Trattoria Reggiano - DESSERT!!  And, yes, a \"specific\" dessert at that!  It's spelled C.A.N.N.O.L.I!!!  This was the highlight of our dinner experience at this restaurant!  If you eat here, you simply MUST - and I can't stress this enough - M.U.S.T. indulge in one of their cannoli's!!!  Absolutelyo TO-DIE-FOR - the BEST cannoli to ever make acquaintance with my palate!!  And for a Bostonian gal, this is really saying something as Bostonians take their cannoli's VERY seriously (just ask anyone if you ever happen to be in Boston!).  In the several decades of living on the west coast, I had never yet experienced a cannoli that could compare with the way they're made on the east coast.  But, I'm here to tell you that at Trattoria Reggiano, they are pure HEAVEN!!  No. 1, they are huge.  They are filled with marscapone, as they should be, with a few, very few, chocolate chips scattered throughout, whipped cream on top and a light drizzing of  caramel syrup on the plate to make it look fancy!  I was NOT happy about sharing this with the hubby, especially when he's never really cared for cannoli's before!!  I wanted to be a glutton and eat the entire thing myself, but I decided to be nice!  Lastly,their bread is also noteworthy.  They're small roundish little knots of bread with a buttery, garlic topping.  Very yummy!  The only thing that prevented me from giving this restaurant more stars was the fact that I wasn't crazy about the sauce, but that is just my own personal taste."}
{"text":"Amazing pastas. The garlic knots were huge and awesome...we had the linguine frutti di mare , linguine with clams, carbonara, and chicken parm. The noodles were cooked perfectly and our server was real friendly and attentive. It looks like they are expanding the restaurant which is even better. I will be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place for Italian. Nothing fancy at all. Like all the reviews state... tiny inside seating, with tables set up along The Grand Canal Shoppes between Venetian and Palazzo. Wonderful bread and oil to start off with. Shared the spaghetti with meatballs and the carbonara. Next time we are in Vegas and craving carbs, oil, garlic, and cream... we will plan to stop here!"}
{"text":"Amanda was super nice .After that  here comes the best garlic rolls I ever tasted!!!!We had to get a 2nd order.I had the shrimp scampi which was good.And my girl had the spaghetti and meatballs which she enjoyed."}
{"text":"Wonderful evening !  Food was delicious, steamed clams, eggplant parm, fettuccine, chicken Marsala. Rosanna, Friday's entertainment, WONDERFUL. upcoming, Diana Krall, Michael Buble style.  Casual yet very special evening. Outdoor eating, fabulous weather. PERFECT EVENING."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp, as we were craving Italian food that was within walking distance of Treasure island. This place was a little hard to find. I get that it's in the Venetian, but some signage would be nice. If you hit to Palazzo from the Venetian, you're going the wrong way!  The place is pretty small, so we were happy to have gotten seating on a Saturday evening. The host that seated us was super friendly and our server was nice. Everyone that helped us here sounded legitimately Italian. Either that or they had a legit Italian faccent (fake accent), which was so good that it may be real.   Food here was a bit pricier than I expected (but was it really? It's dining on the strip...), but was good. They start you off with these garlic bread rolls. Make sure you're limiting how many of these you eat. They will come to suffocate you later when you try to fit more carb into your body. The pastas here come in pretty large sizes and are so tasty you just want to keep eating them. Don't. Trust me when i say to box about half of your pasta. I did just that and I was full after a while, and my family finished theirs and I almost had to roll them to the car because they were so full. It may not have helped that we finished with the tiramisu, which was a custard mixed with ladyfingers served in a wine glass. Everything we had here was delicious. I had the carbonara, my mom had a seafood fettuccine, and my brother had the bolognese. All were really tasty and plentiful.    One of the things I would change about this place is pricing (but I know it's hard to complain about pricing on the strip). Each pasta plate cost around $17-20+. The other thing I would point out is being able to hear the staff get yelled at/scolded since we were seated near the kitchen. It's almost shameful to the staff to face the customers after they just got scolded!  Otherwise, food was great here and service followed through. Give this place a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I specifically went to Yelp to find an Italian restaurant while in Vegas.  I am shocked at how many fantastic reviews are on here.  Either most people have never had real italian food OR they had an off night because my husband and I were thoroughly disappointed.  I had the carbona, and despite it being made with pancetta, it really needed salt!  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was just ok.  It was also kind of difficult to find.  Sorry guys..."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Excellent service, excellent food. The bread rolls were fantastic. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good Italian food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at Downtown Summerlin. Its by Regal and Dave & Busters. It's great for a simple date spot... nice little outside area. The garlic knots and calamari are really good. I keep it simple with the personal pizzas, like the margherita and bruschetta. Always great food and service!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and quick service. The food is very good. Nothing more to say than EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"overprice and mediocre.Servers were pleasant but not very knowledgeable about Italinan food or wine.We asked several about Italian wines and no one knew what we were talking about .Very surprised they dont hire more experienced  service personal..some Italians!"}
{"text":"Paolo, our Italian server, was an amazing host towards the dinner my girlfriend and I had last night. The best shrimp scampi plate I've tried (since it was her plate) and i had the Cesar salad and sausage pizza which was terrific as well. Will come next visit good job guys!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good, but not especially noteworthy - tough competition in Vegas. The carbonara was authentic (no cream) but isn't the best I've had. The balsamic and olive oils left tableside are high quality. And the antipasto platter is huge; even a half order would feed four people!   But the entire experience was marred by awful service that felt like being at an Applebee's and having a waiter-in-training. When we sat down, the menu had barely been presented when we were asked if we wanted to order - he totally misread us and thought we wanted a fast service instead of a relaxing meal (or else he just wanted the table turnover). I am able to look past that, we took our time, ordered, and when the antipasto platter came out, they had substituted a hard cheese for the fresh mozzarella which was disappointing.  When my waiter finally reappeared I asked him about it, and he said \"well it should\", shrugged, and walked away - no offer to fix it or even query the kitchen for an explanation. He also never offered a refill of the raved-about garlic knots - I didn't particularly need them given the size of the platter, but an offer would have been nice and appropriate.  He also brought our entrees prior to the appetizer platter being finished - poor timing by either himself or the kitchen, again expecting fast turnover instead of a relaxing meal. Definitely the opposite of \"authentic Italian\"!  Finally, older reviews talk about a hard to find quiet spot, but the current location is in the food court so there is a lot of foot traffic walking by. In conclusion, even though the food is good (three-star), there are many good Italian places in Las Vegas to dine at, so I can't recommend Trattoria Reggiano."}
{"text":"Probably the best chicken and vegetables in town. You know what I'm talking about once you take your first bite. I always sit at the bar since the bartender is like 10 across the board with her service and personality. Amazing singers as well Wednesday through Saturday."}
{"text":"Small and quaint! A nice change of pace from the usual vegas mass herds. The spaghetti carbonara is fantastic. The prices and very reasonable and the staff was attentive. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I love this place..Authentic Italian.  Everything is so fresh..Rickie is an amazing server.  She is one of the reasons we keep coming back..try the Eggplant Rottini as an appetizer.  Great happy hour too...."}
{"text":"They have the best balsamic vinegar. The ambiance is a little loud  and the tables are somewhat crammed together but service was excellent and food was good."}
{"text":"love the service and the alfredo was good, however the filet mignon meatball wasnt as significant as it claims to be."}
{"text":"Get here early, they don't take reservations. Don't be mislead by this tiny spot- the food is authentic and totally on point! Sit with Amanda, she's the greatest!"}
{"text":"Very Good Italian food done right. Not fancy or overdone. Just really good comfort food."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service needs much improvement. The staff is friendly but need some training to be more attentive. Not enough menus for all guests, water refills are few and far in between, it took a while to figure out who our server was."}
{"text":"When in Vegas and in the Venetian you gotta eat Italian -- right?!  Vegas is know for restaurants large enough to seat the population of a small country, not the case here.  It's an open kitchen with a few tables and a few booths.  Sure the alfresco dinning is in the middle of a mall but it worked. Sometimes you need to get away from the bustle of Vegas and just enjoy a meal and the company you're with.    The service was great especially since we were a party of 4 chatty women wanting separate checks with a bottle of wine.  Ok he couldn't split the bottle across 4 checks.  The waiter handled all our questions by saying, \"I've been married for 30 years ask away!\"  The perfect amount of cheekiness!!!!   The food was traditional Italian  - Few people had eggplant parmigiana.  Huge potions.  Those that had a fridge in their hotel room, they took it home for lunch the next day. Those that didn't, took it to go and gave it to a homeless guy on the strip.   The pizza with eggplant and ricotta was good.  Bonus points for the fact that they removed the skin from the eggplant.  I had a few slices and the rest went to the homeless man mentioned above.   We washed it down with a Chianti sans fava beans!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Venetian is this treasure. I like it so much I have been not once but twice. On this most recent adventure to Las Vegas I got to experience it again so I went a different route and didn't have a rerun of the filet mignon meatballs that I fondly remember from my first visit.  Once we found the place I think I even got the same charming Italian server that I had the prior year. With a very good imagination you could envision yourself at a small bistro in the middle of a village in Italy. The servings at this restaurant are very large so it would be most ideal to share a meal with a friend rather than feel like you need to be wheeled back to your hotel.  The garlic knots/muffins are so darn good I could probably be happy just eating a Caesar salad and this garlicky piece of heaven. But noooo.....eggplant parmigiana was calling my name and it did not disappoint. My friends ordered veal scalloppini piccata and an eggplant ricotta pizza and were all pleased with their orders. There was no room for dessert but I am sure it would be delicious if only there was room."}
{"text":"The food was fine but the service was horrible! We arrived at 6:30pm on a Thursday night and the place was totally empty. We were just trying to grab a quick bite before our movie at 7:45pm next door.   Our server Zekke was awful. The second we said we didn't want to order any drinks he lost all interest. I know that's where restaurants make money but it's not like we were taking a table away from other guests with a higher check. There was probably only 4 tables the entire time we were there. It took 35 minutes to just get a salad and another 20 for the pizza. When the pizza finally came out our server tried to give us tiny bread plates to eat off of. When I asked for a normal sized plate, he rolled his eyes and walked away. I honestly couldn't believe how rude he was!   We left and mentioned to the hostess how horrible the service was but honestly I don't think anyone in that place cared. We won't be back."}
{"text":"For the price, four stars. If it were more expensive three stars. I had the calamari and veal parm. Both were good. The bread was also very good.  If I could give 3.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Fantastic service by Victor!   Pastas were cooked to perfection and garlic knots were superb!!   Had a Ruffino Chianti which was fabulous."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here. We sat outside, they had warmers so it was perfect. They had a guy on a keyboard and another singing, they were awesome. Our server was great. I ordered a cheeseless pizza and she asked if there's was an allergy they needed to know about, which I thought was awesome that she asked. My friend ordered a pasta dish that looked and smelled amazing, but my pizza was awful. Usually when you order something with capers, they're just kinda sprinkled on, but this was like an entire jar of capers had been dumped on the pizza. That was the only thing you tasted. The crust had no flavor, the mushrooms had no flavor, the sauce was barely visible.  The crust was hard and flat, it was like a cracker. I couldn't cut it with a knife, and it was difficult to pick up to eat. But both the pizza and the pasta dish were huge portions and everyone was super friendly so I would recommend this place, just not the pizza."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant tucked away in a corner of the Venetian Grand Canal shops. The staff was very friendly and very attentive.   I was really looking forward to a plate of lasagna and was disappointed when none could be found on the menu. I ended up having the spaghetti with meatballs and it was very good. The garlic bread they serve is fantastic as well.   All in all, I liked it. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Excellent bread for starter. Calamari was on point. YUM!!!! As far as the portion it was perfect for one serving. Nothing more, nothing less. I would dine here again."}
{"text":"Vegas is like the Great Glass Elevator from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Push a button, any button, and *whoosh* you're off to some exotic destination. Is it the great pyramid of the Mojave or will it be a poolside oasis in this devastating heat?   Well, my mama and I wished to be whisked away to the canals of Venice. *Whoosh* and off we went to Palazzo via the Monorail. Although only 1 stop away from MGM Grand where we stayed, we wanted to avoid the 92º heat at 8PM. Sure we still did some walking, but it was nice and cool amongst the marble laden hallways.   After viewing pictures on Yelp of the foods served here, we we're insatiably curious to taste them for ourselves. Our tummies were VERY happy with this choice and so were our wallets!   Trattoria Reggiano is a hole in the wall, tucked away within the Grand Canal Shoppes. Although it has a limited number of booths inside, the seating spills out into the hallway, creating a street cafe effect that seems both authentic and quaint.   We sere seated immediately and we dove right into the menu. And the garlic balls! We both started with wine, ahhhhve cooooourse. To share, we split the meatballs.  Oh, the MEATBALLSSSSS. So tender. So simple. So hot. So meaty. Smothered in the house \"gravy\" or \"marinara\" sauce, these went perfectly with the garlic balls served complimentary. The best things in life, come in ball form. They almost always come as a pair too.   For our entrees, Mama went for the chicken marsala and I, the carbonara.   Mine was so rich, creamy, and the right amount of salty bacon. Although I was extremely full from the meatballs and bread rolls, I don't know how I scarfed this amazing bowl of pasta down, but it was DAMN DELICIOUS.   When all parts of a restaurant (ambiance, service, food, timing) come together in serendipitous unity, it's pure bliss. It's also the button I wanna press all the time in the Great Glass Elevator."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday and was presently surprised at how good it was.  We ordered the bucatini carbonara, linguine with clams and the eggplant parmesan and all were excellent and large portions.  The garlic bread was great but I would just prefer the choice of just plain old  Italian bread.  The balsamic vinegar and olive oil was good but I asked for butter which was brought quickly. Our server Zeki was professional, attentive and polite.  We were also given a dish of olives, red peppers and hard parmesan cheese to our delight.  We will try it again soon."}
{"text":"We went to this joint recently and I'm on the fence. I've heard nothing but great things from the one on the strip. This one is much closer to home.   Service: Our waiter was Jason. The poor guy seemed so stressed and the entire restaurant seemed understaffed. First downside. Jason was great though. Even though he seemed rushed, he was very attentive and quick to make sure our drinks were filled and our food came out in a very timely manner.  His manager or whomever the older gentleman was at the window for food was not. He kept yelling out at the waiters. Which I felt was insanely unprofessional because that window is right next to tables. This is a very open restaurant and you can see all of the cooking staff.  There was a time that Jason was taking our order and the manager yelled out \"Jason! Order up!\" And Jason kind of glanced over at him to show him that he was in the middle of taking our order.  Who does this? I don't know. But I hope he sees this and realizes that it makes him look horrible and the restaurant in general.  Also, hire more people or staff appropriately. We went during prime time, 7:30ish. You should be fully staffed. Otherwise, you have a bunch of waiters running around trying to serve a ridiculous amount of tables and people are going to start to get frustrated.   Food: I wasn't really that impressed. The calamari was good, but a bit too peppery. The marinara was very good and very flavorful. We also had the lobster ravioli and the lasagna.  Ravioli...it was good. It was probably my favorite dish. But the lasagna kind of lacked in flavor. It was very mediocre and pretty plain. Which in my experiences in Las Vegas, it's all roughly the same for lasagna for some odd reason.   The restaurant itself isn't very large. They have a nice sized patio if you want to dine outside and they do have a nice selection of wines. The best was they have a nice description of what the wine is, so that is very helpful. We had the Barbera D'Asti. I highly recommend if you like red full bodied wines.  The prices we reasonable as well.   Overall, I'm sure I'll go back to try other dishes. It's a nice location and another good addition to the Summerlin Downton Mall."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service.   The atmoshere was excellent, with nice lighting and being able to do some people watching while enjoying a dinner.   The food was average at best.  Veal parm was good, but the sauce wasn't above average.  The spinach and zucchini soup was purred and very bland.   Chocolate mouse was tasty but too thick and rich instead if fluffy and light.   Chicken Marsala was overcooked and small.  Although I was disappointed in the food, the atmosphere made the experience worth a try.  I just don't think it lived up to authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical because this restaurant is so small and located to the side of a coffee bean. Moreover, it is next to a service door where lots of workers come in and out with garbage. However, don't be fool because this place is wonderful. The portions are big and the service is warm and friendly! The pasta are audente and the marinara sauce that I had is fresh and tangy! The meatballs are dense and packed with flavor. My bf had the clam linguini which he claims is the best he had (he always orders the clam linguni at every Italian restaurant).   The bread that comes in the beginning is also very good and comes fresh and soft!   It is not cheap but it is a great alternatives to the over hyper restaurants nearby. I really enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"OMG! This is the best Italian food I have ever had!,,, I love Italian food and travel quite a bit. The food was excellent! The sauces were flavorful without being to overbearing. The restaurant was quaint and personable. We had great wine and service was excellent. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Service is absolutely excellent. However, the food was really really salty. I wish I had sent the carbonara back, but I was really enjoying my anniversary. They did however send a nice complimentary cannoli for our anniversary per our reservation notes. I was thankful of that for sure. Food is a little for the quality."}
{"text":"The garlic knots were amazing. We ordered the lobster ravioli and the shrimp marinara, both delicious and the shrimp we're cooked just perfectly. Friendly staff and very attentive. Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"OMG Omg authentic Italian food. U must go here, this is the best Italian food I've ever had. Everything is made fresh to order, even the pasta!!! I will definitely be back. Everything on the menu is amazing and a party in my mouth!!!"}
{"text":"A very mediocre \"Italian\" restaurant. This place was a disappointment unfortunately. No energy here at all and the place was almost empty while I was there. There are better options elsewhere in Las Vegas for sure."}
{"text":"Very yummy. You feel like you're under the beautiful skies. The ambiance was a bit tight and awkward when tourists would come and take pics all around us..."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and overpriced. I had a four cheese pizza. I have tasted better in other less expensive restaurants.  The service was meh. The guy pushed the higher cost menu items even after we refused. Also we went fairly early for the dinner rush and they were already out of salmon and truffle. It is disappointing that they were already out of main ingredients for the dishes we truly wanted to get. I will admit I liked seeing Copa America on the TV, but that isn't enough to make me want to try this place again."}
{"text":"Place is beautiful, no doubt. $16.00 for the Kale Chicken Salad is too pricey for lunch. The pizza looked great but I have to say the tomato sauce was very bland and had no flavor. I had to salt the pizza."}
{"text":"My friend and I are creatures of habit and loved this place so much last year that we had to come back.  We got here around 6:45 on Saturday night and there were a couple groups ahead of us.  Despite this, the host/manager said to come back at 7.  We arrived at 7 and he said it'd be a few extra minutes.  There was an empty table for 4 being cleared and I knew we were next on the list, but he sat a party of 4 there before us, leaving us waiting for a party of 2 to get up.  I realize that they don't have many tables and it would seem like a waste to sit a party of 2 at a 4-top, but it was poor service since they rushed a party of 2 out after that, though we still waited another 10 minutes for them.  The server wasn't nearly as friendly as last time.  He was a little rude when I asked for bread and said, \"Lady, this a busy store!\" in his Italian accent.  I realized it was busy, but we'd been sitting there over 5 minutes before he even came over and then he didn't bring bread the first 2 times he stopped by.  And I was damn hungry.  We both lightened up and he got a nicer toward the end of the meal (probably to bring up his tip).  Food was still excellent.  Got the penne primavera with grilled chicken.  I wish I got something with red sauce, though, because it looked so good, but I remembered how good the primavera was.  Big portions and despite my hunger, I couldn't finish it all.  Pinot Grigio wasn't as good as I recall, but maybe I've just had better since then.  Overall, I'd still recommend for a cheaper, solid meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food....prices are a little too high for what it is.....and selection of wines Way too small"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, carbs! i likee (= i am such a carb whore. I could probably eat pasta and bread with butter all day long, which is perfect for an Italian food! Trattoria Raggiano is such dainty little restaurant that it was kind of hard to find in the Venetian. Honestly, I totally did not except the restaurant to be that small, but nevertheless Trattoria did made me feel like i dining at Italian grandmother's home. (=  Our waiter was nice and patient, even though we kept on asking questions about their menus and had more people joining our party. he brought us a basket of yummy garlic rolls with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Woww, i could munch on those garlic rolls all day!  Filet Mignon Meatballs - Oh geez, these meatballs were so soft and fluffy. It felt like my tongue was sleeping on a pillow of wonderful meaty and tomatoey goodness! Lobster Ravioli - Yummy! The Ravioli was perfectly formed with just the right amount lobster to pasta ratio. The texture of the lobster was so soft, in contrast with al-denta ravioli. The sauce was rich and creamy. (= Four Cheese Orecchiette - The Orecchiette was stuffed with four different types of cheese! For all of you cheese lovers out there, this is the perfect pasta dish for you. (= Neapolitan Pizza with Sausage and Mushroom - The crust on the pizza was thin and crispy. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Simple, delicious, and it just hits the hunger pangs (="}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this little restaurant in the Venetian last year and went back twice this year when I was dealing the series.  Everything is pretty good, HOWEVER, this place has the best baked ziti.  My friend Sandi, also went back multiple times just for this dish.  The place has great tables that feel outdoors, and fun if you like people watching.  It has a fun, Italian feel, with good service, and tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for recommending this place. Stopped in tonight and had the spaghetti and filet meatballs. Delicious. The garlic knots come with your meal and they are a must with the olive oil and balsamic they provide. I sat at the bar and my experience was excellent, thanks Heather!   It's a small little place hidden in the shops at palazzo/venetian. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks and a appetizer before a movie.  Really enjoyed it here and we will be back."}
{"text":"Normally love this place. The quality has gone down. The garlic knots are not as soft, garlicky or buttery. They were fresh and warm though.   I tried the Shrimp Scampi for the first time and was disappointed. Very salty, the garlic butter used to toss the pasta lacked flavor and was barely on plate. My husband got the swordfish picatta which was good. I will say that the fish is always enjoyable. We shared a Cesar salad and was pleased with this. I wish I would have had the eggplant parmigiana. I have had this in the past and loved it. I had issues overnight after my shrimp scampi. I will not order again or recommend that dish. Service was ok. Just average."}
{"text":"We almost walked away... My dad wasn't impressed with its size nor its quaint decor, but I can be persistent and with the help of yelp we did circle back around and sit down. Thank you Jesus!  It is a tiny establishment with but a few tables inside sight eh majority of the others lined up out front where people pass you by often checking out the sights and stores of the mall but you soon get over that once the food starts being delivered in the quickest fashion I have ever seen. We had at least two waiters working our tables, making sure we had all we needed. The wine was a bit expensive, only a few we're offered by the glass, but my nevola was damn try and perfect with my entry.  The food... The food... Ummm... Wow... The pillow-like garlic knots buttered to perfection, the 3 large filet minon meatballs in a red sauce that fell apart in your mouth, and the stuffed to bursting lobster ravioli with actual chunks of lobster inside covered in a creamy vodka sauce were all just too perfect. I'm soo glad we stopped, even my dad who went healthy for this particular meal was impressed with the large thin-cut swordfish covered with olives aNd tomatoes in a white wine sauce and large helping of squash And zucchini left him a bit impressed too. Yay!   The food made it worth the time we spent trying find this tiny little gem but for 5 stars the ambience and overall dining experience need to be top notch and this place just really needs a new location in a much bigger area so that all the tables could be inside and not in the main mall hallway."}
{"text":"Great place for an in-and-out casual meal. Made reservations on OpenTable and seated right away. Yum garlic knots provided with GOOD! olive oil & balsamic to temper our hunger. Ordered specialty arugula salad with truffle infused dressing, couldn't really taste truffle. The amazing shaved parmesan and anchovies made up for it. Authentic Italian sausage pizza with fresh mozzarella...we added fresh basil. Kudos to our server Victor for taking time to chat with us and make our meal memorable!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and the delicious food! From the garlic knots to the chicken Parmesan, everything was perfection! Make sure to try the chicken tortellini it's my favorite! And don forget the dessert, from cheesecake to cannolis don't end the night without trying one of their signature desserts! I'll recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and family."}
{"text":"This place was a cozy little place tucked away near the food court of the Venetian. Our server, who also seemed to be either the manager or owner, seated our party of three immediately. He was very friendly and nice, and spoke with what seemed like a legitimate Italian accent!   The overall atmosphere was authentic and cozy feeling, with light Italian and classical music playing.   I ordered the linguini bolognese and it was served promptly. It was nothing spectacular but thoroughly satisfying. The bread they served was pretty good too, brushed with garlic butter, but not as warm as I would've wanted. Overall a great place with above average food at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"This place was Great! The food was excellent, Bethany was great. Would happily recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome service!  Our server was Paolo, he was nice and professional with a good sense of humor. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the garlic rolls on the 1st round were not warm, We will be back again when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I wanted pasta in Vegas, but I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg. So I yelped Italian and found Trattoria Reggiano in the Venetian. It was a bit pricey, $18 for spaghetti and meatballs. But the meatballs were made of filet mignon, so they were way better than normal. I really wanted to try the Frutti de Mare, but that was $29. Yikes...so it was worth it, since me and my boyfriend shared it. I also like the garlic bread! It's so classy, and served in a cone. I don't know if I'll go here again though, probably a one time thing."}
{"text":"Service - Very Italian.  Short and to the point.  Never trust someone who tells you EVERYTHING on the menu is good.  Reservation - None taken.  Expect a wait because the place is small.  Food - Hit or miss. 1. Filet Mignon Meatballs - A must.  Really tender and moist.  2. Linguine Bolognese - Not acidic.  However, the meat was not very tender.  3. Lobster Ravioli - Doused in sauce.  Ravioli had minced lobster and not chunks. 4. Linguine with Shrimp Marinara - Bland and really garlicky. 5. Complimentary Garlic Knots - A complete joke.  Soft but really dense."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome!!! Truth be told I already cooked dinner for myself and my other half tonight, yet I found myself stuffing my face with delicious meatballs! We were out and about shopping and my BF wanted something sweet, I was in support of a restaurant so I could have a glass of wine. The restaurant is very intimate, which I love!! They offer outdoor seating, another plus, plus a great happy hour. We decided to share the spaghetti and meatballs and let me tell you, hands down best meatballs in Vegas. My BF grew up in a very strict Italian family and he could not stop talking about how great the meatballs are. We have no desire to go to another Italian restaurant in Vegas. We of course got our something sweet in the end where my BF chose the Carrot Cake and I went for the Cannoli. Both were amazing!!!! Danny G. the manager helped me to decide to order the Cannoli since he was bragging about how good it is and that they make it fresh in house, SOLD!!! Danny G. was a delight who went over and beyond any expectations to make a casual stroll into dinner #2. Thank you all for a fabulous time!!"}
{"text":"Very rude.dont bother asked a simple question and the waiter was very condescending.  Got up and left.bye bye"}
{"text":"Great Italian food & service!    I can not wait to go back with  my family & friends. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"\"Was excited about the swordfish carpaccio.. It was horrible! No flavor whatsoever! Service was not great either.. Overpriced for no good reason..the linguine with seafood was mehh...nothing out of the ordinary to wow me! I never got a waiter to come over and ask how I was doing, did I enjoy the food, did I want another glass of prosecco? Needless to say, I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I had the spaghettti pomodoro and my husband had the spaghetti puttanesca.  I really liked the sauce.  The wait was less than twenty minutes but the host served a group of people to their seats before us - that made me angry because we had been waiting and they had just arrived.  The meals arrived quickly and the dinner rolls were yummy too."}
{"text":"We went to grape street in January and let me just say you have it all over them. Our waitress Teressa was wonderful and Mimmo is my new favorite person very classy. The food was absolutely amazing. The garlic knots with the oil and vinegar just wow I couldn't stop eating them. I ordered one of their signature drinks it was delicious we went during lunch time and had the balsamic chicken salad. And also one of their pizzas. I cannot wait to go back for dinner! This is a must place to eat!"}
{"text":"Last week we went to trattoria reggiano and it was amazing. We had such a great experience. I ordered the filet mignon meatballs and I can't wait until we go back and I can get them again. What made this experience stand out was how personable the manager, Flavia, was. She checked on us and gave us pointers and advice on what to see on our vacation. (we had much fun playing tourist that weekend we didn't tell anyone we are actually locals)"}
{"text":"They have really nice servers and the food is great. The pizza here is very tasty and their arugula salad tastes very good. I have had much better pizza before but the service is great."}
{"text":"I got here a lot because there always seems to be a shorter wait than with the big restaurants in St Marks Squared and the food is priced similarly and just as good.  It's a bit hard to find but it's right next to the Coffee Bean, just past where the gondola water ends.  We've ordered the spaghetti and meatballs for years because the meatballs are amazing and now we always get the chicken parm.  We were there over the weekend and tried the baked ziti, it wasn't for us.  Not sure what type of cheese they used but it just didn't care for it.  I have had problems with service because when it's busy they are a bit inattentive but the food always makes me turn a blind eye."}
{"text":"Great little Italian joint. Polite servers. Good service. Good food. The spaghetti and meatballs and vodka infused penne were both very flavorful, especially the meatballs themselves. The burrata appetizer was good overall except for the burrata itself being super small - for the price of the plate, it should be either been 2 pieces or a much larger piece. Overall, absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were in Vegas this past weekend and wanted to have a nice meal the first night we were there. We felt like Italian so on to Yelp we went and found this cute spot! We went around 9pm and it wasn't very busy, the hostess was also friendly. There's a small \"patio\" with hedges outlining it and it also where we sat. The decor was nice and felt homey. The menu wasn't huge, but had a nice selection of pasta and pizzas. I ordered the carbonara and my sister ordered the eggplant parmesan. The carbonara was delicious! It really hit the spot because I was craving something richer so I'd be satiated for the late night we were about to have. The prosciutto was crispy and the noodles were perfectly al dente. The portion was just enough to not have leftovers or feel too full. Oh, and as you've probably read in majority of reviews, their complimentary garlic knots were awesome! You can't have Italian food without garlic bread and these were the best I've had anywhere, they're packed with flavor! The price point was decent considering it was in The Venetian. BTW, you might miss this spot but it's on the way to the food court upstairs. It was a toss up between this place and Casanova which was across from it. I'd be happy to eat here again!"}
{"text":"A Bit Hard to Find and Average\"  This is the kind of restaurant that is not exciting. Definitely a bit hard to fine. The Decore is average, the food is average and the services is average. When you go out in Vegas you want to be in a place that is exciting, alive Vegas style! we went their because of the 5 star rating but we were both disapointed. My pasta Carbonara was a bit greasy and my wife very simple pomodoro was a bit blend! Our server was friendly. Italian food is not very complicated. fresh ingredients, good seasoning and great pasta..."}
{"text":"Located in the Venetian, this is a cool, casual spot to grab a sit down meal without all the frills of Vegas dining. Our server was great. Very attentive and super nice. The food tasted like good ol' comfort Italian food - which is exactly what I was craving. All in all, a great chill dinner success story"}
{"text":"Best food and staff in town hands down!  I am gluten free and they accommodated everything amazingly and made me feel so comfortable.  The bartender Bethany took time to make sure she had everything right and was so helpful and an absolute pleasure to be around. The GM Wendy and the manager Daniel were accessible to everyone in the restaurant and were so courteous, they immediately make you feel like you are part of a big Italian family, which I actually am! First time here but 100% not the last. Thank you so much for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write this review for a long time. My husband and i got married at the Venetian resort, which is an amazing hotel, and we continue going there every year. The night before our wedding we and our four friends decided to go to this cozy looking Italian restaurant mainly the atmosphere seemed very nice and we love Italian food.   However, I ordered a pasta dish not sure which one, with chicken and it came without, which I instantly noted to the waiter. Of course the waiter was apologetic, went to the kitchen to ask for the chicken, which I found very strange, perhaps even more strange when the chicken came out in a bowl, they had cooked the already frozen cooked chicken in cream in the microwave, so basically I was meant to add that to my pasta, It was hilariously disappointing, and our friends weren't very impressed about their pizzas either, and barely touched them."}
{"text":"Excelllent service  It was a little cozy spot we didn't even plan on going to, but it looked inviting so we went for it.   I ordered seafood pasta, and my boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli which was amazing!   Our server was great which our dinner more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Simply the most authentic Italian restaurant you will find in Las Vegas.  Buon appetite."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here for a company dinner while in Las Vegas. The wait wasn't too long considering how busy they are. They provide lots of delicious sides such as garlic bread, grilled artichokes and salad. I tried their lasagne. It was pretty good but not the best I have ever had. It's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Why?  Why did my yelp app point me to this place among all the other Italian places in LV?  While I cannot answer that question, I can tell you that we were not fans.  First, the service was terrible.  Our waiter was un-friendly and abrupt.  After we were seated, he came to our table and asked if we knew what wanted to eat.  He never asked us for a drink order.  We had two friends join us who had already eaten, and in the time it took our waiter to come over they were able to walk over to the coffee bean, order drinks, pick them up, and enjoy them.    So we ordered, and we placed our entire order at that time - drinks, apps, entrees and desserts.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And then we got our entrees with no appetizer.  The waiter seemed pissed off, and made a comment about the kitchen staff.  Well, what about his job of checking on our table?  Ugh, annoying.  So we canceled the appetizer order and just ate the main course.  We had the pesto gnocchi.  It was bland.  The gnocchi was nice though.  The bread was also delicious, if not a tad bit oily.  But still, warm and yummy.  Our friends ordered dessert and one of them liked the Tiramisu, but the other did not.  She was expecting a layered-caked style tiramisu, vs. the layered in a glass tiramisu they received.  The atmosphere also brings this review down a star.  The majority of the tables are set up in the hallway and it makes it feel like you are eating in a shopping mall food court.  Lots of people milling around staring at you while you eat, from an arm's length away.  Not really what I would call charming ambiance.    This was by far my least favorite meal in LV, in terms of service, food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Found a wire in the served spaghetti. A waitress took it away without any apology. Really bad service and the food is plain. We don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Literally the worst dining experience we've had in the 3 years we've lived here. If I could give 0 stars I would. Please don't mistake this place being good just because it's in the Venetian. I'd much rather go to Olive Garden or Brio over this place in a heartbeat. The waitress was just awful. She places olive oil and balsamic on our table when we get there, only for us to receive bread 30 minutes later. She has no personality and seems bothered by us even being there. We're ignored the entire time while she's laughing with coworkers. We put in for appetizers, and when she finally stops ignoring us and comes back to the table, her response is, \"So are you ready to finish ordering or what?\" I'm glad I had my back to the kitchen because my husband saw them literally opening a bag of pasta to serve! My lobster and his shrimp were frozen. The lobster was so chewy it was barely edible and the shrimp were very minuscule. It's very easy to determine what's fresh and what's not when 1) you're Italian and 2) you lived in Florida for 20 years and know what fresh seafood is. All in all, I wouldn't let my dog eat their food, and I'm still killing myself paying $135 for the worst meal ever!"}
{"text":"This place was lovely, I think the hole Venetian mall is, plus the service is amazing. I went with my 7 month old baby and they really did a great job. The food was delicious, although for my the pasta needed a little more boiling. However, the salsa , meat , eggplant was so yummy! Good menu."}
{"text":"Amanda is the best!!! Great service, friendly, and very helpful. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over 10 years.  Good Italian eatery if you are in the shoppes at the Venetian.  In the food court area and reasonable prices for the portions you get.  4 stars because food had been a bit salty last few times, but very good."}
{"text":"This place feels Italian, looks like a great place for dinner... and then disappoints in every possible way.   The short version: overpriced, terribly RUDE service, and bland food will definitely keep me away from this restaurant.   We visited this place to celebrate having family in town. What better place to celebrate family than in an Italian restaurant, am I right? Well, today I was sadly mistaken.   The place was half empty despite being a busy Saturday in the Venetian. We were seating immediately after our arrival and an older waiter came to our table to drop off the menus as well olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Not the friendliest of greetings, but I let it slide.   While we were waiting to decide on our meal, I asked our waiter for some bread (thought it was odd we got the oil and vinegar, but no bread) to which he abruptly replied \"bread comes to the table after you place your order\". What's this all about? Was he afraid we were going to dine on free bread and water?!? Anyways, we then placed he order and things got really awkward.   After waiting for our food for a few minutes, the waiter came to our table, literally dropped my girlfriends plate in front of her from about an inch above the table top, and set my plate as well as my brothers. He left without a word.   Upon a closer look of my dish, something seemed off with the ingredients, but before asking I thought I would try it. This dish was bland, tasted of canned sauce and was not what I had ordered. Before I could even say anything, the waiter rushed to my table, took the fork from my hand and then pulled my dish of the table... without saying a single word.   That was it for me. I raised my voice and asked him what was going on only to hear him utter the words \"the chef made a mistake, I'm fixing it\". While I appreciate him trying to fix it, his gross demeanor and terrible attitude interrupted the mood in the table, and upset everyone. To add insult to injury, the manager came over and tried to brush the incident off by justifying the waiters behavior and telling me not to worry about it. Not worry about it? Why would I be worried? I didn't do anything wrong!!!!  The worst part of all? The manager was within feet of our table the whole time, and he apparently knows this waiter is terrible.   DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"I was browsing through recommended Italian restaurants while visiting Vegas with the family and ran into Reggiano's reviews and decided on it from a long list of options. We had some trouble finding the place and almost gave up on our search by entering a more visible (and quite busy) Italian eatery, but we persevered and made with the location.  The restaurant area is small which in my opinion helps it with its mom & pop feel (just ignore the food court traffic). Tables were close together but I have to admit I did not feel crowded in there. I do believe we scored a very good table in the small patio area - we may have gotten really lucky there. We were seated promptly, server was prompt to our table and overall very pleasant. Ok, let's talk food now, shall we? One of the main reasons we decided on Reggiano's was the hailed filet mignon meatballs, so that was a must order item for us.  We ordered the appetizer meatballs and before even trying them, I was brave (and confident) that ordered some more in my spaghetti entree, since I decided to go simple and take full advantage of the raved meatballs. I'm afraid I couldn't tell you what the fuzz is all about. The meatballs we simply OK and nothing to write home about (yet I am writing about them here). Equally blend and unimpressive was my spaghetti entree. Expecting to taste a traditional and flavorful sauce, I felt I was eating something only barely better than a fast food joint pasta plate. I do regret not having the opportunity to try some of the other entrees mentioned, but I did try the tortellini with chicken in alfredo sauce and that is a plate I can stand behind. The chicken was perfectly cooked, soft and juicy and was an excellent to the delicious cheese-filled tortellini. I was not alone in this verdict, as we all shared our plates (as any sensible family would do). This makes me regret not ordering a chicken based entree, but I hope to get the chance to try other recommended plates on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"Service is terrible.  Fettuccine was chewy and the shrimp scampi was very fishy.  I would not go back here.  Thought it would be quick and easy before we headed out for the night but Yelp failed me this time."}
{"text":"The Caprese appetizer isnt something traditional but the cheese was delicious. The tortelloni alfredo was good. The waiter checked on us periodically and they brought a complimentary veggie/cheese dish which was ok. The garlic bread was never replenished that was given in the beginning. The calamari smelled awful - too fishy. I wanted meat with my dish and they couldnt add it for extra. I had to buy meat balls on the side just to pair it with something. My friend's spaghetti and meat balls were plain sauce wise and my other friend's white wine pasta dish was not appetizing at all. Ended up spending almost $200 between the 3 of us. There was definitely nothing special about this place. I dont mind spending good money on quality italian but I think its more hype than anything else. Overall mediocre. I dont think Id come back again. Im usually not a complainer/nit picker but for someone who loves Italian food and doesnt mind forking out the money it was a big let down."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on our last night and it was a mistake. Should have stuck with The Barrymore. Overall review of this place is that it's overpriced subpar Italian food with average service. The garlic bread was hard and tasted like yesterday's bread. I got the penne with prosciutto and didn't see any prosciutto ugh MEH.COM is more like it. Never again..."}
{"text":"Simple and straight forward. To be honest we stumbled in here after gambling and drinking for a few hours in need of carbs and water. Thankfully they delivered. The spaghetti and meatballs was excellent as well as the bread. Finished it off with cappuccino. Excellent service to top it off. Perfect mini Italiana!"}
{"text":"decent prices for Vegas with a decent ambiance, and the food was really good! The gluten free pizza crust is a hard one to do well, but I absolutely loved it! Service was quick and impersonal, but efficient! Can't expect much more in Vegas! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I'm so glad my friends and I stumbled upon it. We were expecting a much bigger restaurant, and were very surprised to find it was so small and intimate.  Our host and waiter were very friendly and gave us honest feedback on our dinner choices. All of the meals tasted fantastic but the swordfish I ordered was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Amazing service & amazing food. Definitely will come back to this place when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"This place was Highly recommended, from some out of town guest, we live here and never have gone. Mixed reviews I would say.... The tiniest place I've ever seen to dine semi fancy.... More workers then tables so FABulous service!!! I had lobster ravioli it was ok, I never tasted any lobster just a lobster flavor stuffing type filling. My mom had eggplant parmesan, she said hers is better and other party member had chicken parmesan I tasted his, just so so. The sauce to me tasted a little like chef-boy-ordie, it's vey light in color and I like rich robust tomato sauce. However the cheese cake I give a FIVE to, it is fantastic, I say have dinner at one of the wonderful restaurants there in The Venetian and come here for desert and the coffee was fab as well!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the location inside the mall, this is a legit Italian restaurant. It's a small place which gives you excellent and very friendly service. The garlic knots are some of the best I've had anywhere.  The linguini bolognese was first rate and goes perfectly with a glass of malbec.  Don't spend twice as much for lesser food at one of the mega-restaurants in a casino, go here for an excellent meal at a reasonable (for Vegas) price."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! We went and it was about 9:20 pm and they were supposed to have stopped serving but the hostess (who was super cute btw) took pity on us and sat us. The waiter was wonderful! He was from Modena (also ridiculously handsome) and he gave us some wonderful advice. We were going to order two pasta dishes and a soup and he told us it was a lot of food so we wouldn't over order. The mussels were amazing and the Pasta Bolognese (probably misspelled that) was divine! Also, last but definitely not least the prices were the most reasonable we've seen so far! Go here. It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been to their Summerlin location. It was a Sunday night slow and almost closing time but the manager greeted us in, the bartender Bethany was very good and service was prompt and friendly.  They decent selection of wine, I had the Veal Piccata and my wife had the shrimp scampi. Both turned out good however as a authentic Italian restaurant I was expecting in house fresh pasta as oppose to packet pasta, but again not sure its because it was almost closing time. Since this restaurant location is close to my home I am sure I will visit again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to eat there before leaving sin city. Seeing 4 stars on yelp, we thought that we were gonna enjoy good Italian food.   She had the veal milanese and I had the spaghetti meatball. My question is why 4 stars ? Has anyone ever tried Italian food ??? I only give 2 star because our server was good. The food is really basic and is definitely not worth the price.   My girl said that this place should had been in the food court along with burger king."}
{"text":"On our trip to Vegas we planned on going to eat at this place for lunch after reading the reviews. This location would've received a 5 star of the actual service would've been good. When we arrived the gentlemen and lady in the front took us to a booth. We didn't have to wait at all. The waiter took our order and once our food arrived at our table the waiter was just standing in the front watching golf and talking. All the other waiters went to the tables a few times while our waiter did not come once to check if we needed a refill or anything. The only reason why he came back, was to give us the bill. The food was great but the service....can't say the same."}
{"text":"This place is pretty freakin' adorable and pretty damn good, too.  I wandered in around 6:00 one night and grabbed a table.  It's a cute little place with not many tables (probably about 10 inside, and 10 or so outside as well).  I started with the filet mignon meatballs and was very happy that I did.  Three large meatballs, tender and juicy, covered with a yummy marinara sauce.  Very good, and well worth the cost in my opinion.  I ended up ordering the gnocchi, and the host/other waiter heard my order as he walked by and actually exclaimed, \"Oh!  The Gnocchi!  Yes!\"  I thought it was pretty funny.  He was right, too, though.  It was a large bowl filled with gnocchi and a basil pesto sauce that tasted as good (or even a little better) than it looked.  The rolls were good, and the price was very reasonable for everything as well.  I felt like I was at a real Italian eatery, which was pretty fun too."}
{"text":"Seating is a bit limited but I really like how the tables are out in front of the restaurant, almost feels like you are actually sitting outside. It's an adorable, relaxing setting even in the middle of all the chaos. Good choice for a sit-down dinner after walking around the shops.  It was so hard to choose what to order. I love pasta and everything sounded good to me. Decided on the tortelloni alfredo - creamy, smooth, and very cheesy. Taste-wise, I would have enjoyed it even more if the dish contained some vegetables or chicken. But it was delicious and extremely filling."}
{"text":"We wanted a somewhat casual not quite fancy Italian restaurant in our hotel and this did the trick! The food was good, I had the lobster ravioli. The lobster was a tiny bit over cooked in my opinion but the ravioli itself was delicious. Bonus for playing the UCLA game (this may not be your cup of tea having a tv in an Italian place but it was perfect for us at the time). They even brought out cake for my friends birthday. Our waiter Brandon was fantastic! We raved about him to the manager, who, herself, seemed absolutely lovely. The service here was truly excellent. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best dinners ever.  Food was prepared perfect. Appetizers were Calimary with marinara sauce and a Caprese Salad, stunning.  I ordered the Shrimp Linguini Marinara with crisp golden French Fries and the wife had USDA NY Steak with Vegetables.  Steak was a beautiful medium rare; vegetables were crisp clean and sautéed perfectly. On to dessert... Tiramisu, Ricotta Cheese Cake, Lemon Sorbet and Gelato... wonderful and an absolute symphony of flavor. You know all the ingrediants, foods and sauces were prepared fresh and with passion.   I would like to compliment the Chef, kitchen staff, servers and Management for outstanding food and service. I will be back with family for sure."}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious! Hands down one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Ordered the Mussels and Fried Calamari for an appetizer and they were equally delicious. Mussels were cooked perfectly and the calamari was tender, crispy and seasoned well. For the entrée, we split a chicken parmigiana... perfection. The service was A1! We will visit this wonderful establishment every time we come to Vegas, for sure."}
{"text":"Quaint little Italian restaurant in the Venetian with good food and very good service. Had the spaghetti and beef meatballs which tasted fresh and clean. Not the most flavorful dish but certainly delicious. It's not super expensive but it is Vegas"}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that this restaurant received an average of 4 stars.   1) Food - the food was decent, although $18 for spaghetti and a couple of meatballs? Filet mignon meatballs? This was an average dish, but supposedly one of the 'go to' dishes.   2) Service - terrible. We never were offered additional bread, and perhaps after we didn't order wine with dinner, this caused the poor service. Our waiter never came to our table again until it was time for the bill.   3) Value- see #1, sorry. I've been to Nora's in Las Vegas before (should have gone there instead). That's awesome Italian food. This place is very overpriced for what you get.   This restaurant was a major disappointment especially considering the price. It looks nice from the outside before entering, but afterwards, it was a major disappointment.   Too bad I took my wife for an occasion dinner here."}
{"text":"Average food at above average prices, and below average ambiance.  It's a tiny restaurant with a few tables inside, and several more tables \"outside,\" if you can call it that (but not even in the fancy Grand Canal area).  It really felt like I was eating a fancy dinner seated in the middle of the mall.  The service was spot-on, but that can't make up for their more fundamental shortcomings.  Next time, I'd rather eat at a restaurant with classier ambiance, like Canaletto along the Grand Canal... or at just about any Carino's or Macaroni Grill..."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant at the Venetian this time and it was sooooo good! The service provided by Santina was attentive and well provided. They have a great wine list, a bit pricey by the glass but good. We had the calamari for the appetizer and it was breaded lightly and tasty. We had the eggplant and chicken parmigiana both had pasta and were prepared flawlessly. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Excellent food service is good. You have to get the Calamari it's the best I got the chicken parmesan it was super good. Great environment for friends and family I will come again. We came here for a company dinner much better place then usual lol."}
{"text":"Don't let the location of this italian eatery inside the Venetian mall-area fool you.  It may be small, and if you choose to sit \"outside\" you may have groups of people walking passed you as they peruse the other stores, but Trattoria Reggiano turns out some really good food.  The complimentary garlic parmesan bread are big soft pieces of pillows -- be careful, you could get full off these alone -- but even that wouldn't be so bad because they are very good.  Though I only tried two pasta dishes - the carbonara and spaghetti with meatballs - both were delicious and more than enough to where you will surely have leftovers.   The sauce alone in the spaghetti tasted homemade and had so much flavor you would think a sweet Italian grandmother was back there whipping it up -- ya never know -- coulda been.  We all know that eating out in Vegas can add up, whether you're doing buffets or restaurants, but I'm happy to say that Trattoria Reggiano's prices are so reasonable that you will have plenty of paper leftover for the casinos and cocktails.  And the owner is a very friendly and accommodating man.  Don't sleep on this place, I know I won't, and am looking forward to coming back when I find myself returning to the city of sin."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Friendly and fast.  Did not think it was crowded like some thought but we did come  at 5pm.  The meatballs are really good and have to agree with most here a must.  Garlic bread was also good.  So get the staples for sure. My wife had the Penne with vodka sauce and added some changes, she loved it.  I went with the pizza Quattro Stagioni.  Good but if you love super thin cracker style cruse this is not it.  A bit thicker than I like.  So it gets a 3 but for service and friendly people it's a 5."}
{"text":"My first impression was, \"Cute cafe like Italian restaurant subtly inserted in a wall of the Venetian!\"  You might just walk by this little restaurant if you don't pay attention. Among the many shops and little stores within the Venetian, Trattoria Reggiano may only catch a glimpse of your attention because of their \"outdoor patio.\" It's more just some tables set up nicely outside. Not bad, but I think they do that just to seat more people. Inside the restaurant seats just a few parties because there are about 10 small booths more or less. Their kitchen is tiny! Their ambiance definitely catches the intended theme of an \"Italian street side cafe.\"  It's a cute little place if you're craving some Italian food. Great garlic rolls, almost drenched in the oil and seasonings, some might complain. But I personally really liked it. We ordered the margarita pizza, and a pasta dish that I cannot recall the name of. But neither of the dishes were memorable and I really can't see myself ordering anything other than the basic spaghetti or Alfredo the next time I go there. Mainly, I'd be back for their garlic rolls. The food was okay, the service was okay (slightly rude), the ambiance quaint.  The lasting impression? \"I'll be back for some good ol' spaghetti and garlic rolls. But that's about it.\""}
{"text":"Seated right away.  Seats were not cleaned.  I had to brush off food remnants from bench seats.  Ordered calamari which took FOREVER.  Not bad taste, but not great.  Wife ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  Meatballs were not too bad.  But spaghetti sauce was like it was out of a can or Ragu.  Not impressed.  I had linguine with clams.  Pasta not cooked right and the sauce lacked salt.  I had to salt it myself.    Overall:  2 stars.  Mediocre service from staff.  Very slow kitchen.  Mediocre food quality.  Contrary to other positive reviews, I would not recommend this place nor would I come here again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants in Vegas period.   Authentic cooking and quaint service and nice prices.  We loved the great home cooked food!!!"}
{"text":"The Margarita Pizza was one of the best I've ever had. The baked ziti was incredible. Excellent garlic knots before our meals arrived. So good that we went there 2 days in a row for dinner.Reasonable prices and great wait staff. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure. A very authentic Italian kitchen. I love the Penne alla vodka. The staff is friendly. Everything is super fresh and tasty. Rarely I find pasta al dente as they should be. I visit this gem every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite restaurant for the past year as I am very picky about my pasta but every pasta dish here is to die for! Best waiter is Mimmo, he's wonderful and sweet and attentive. Everyone I bring loves it. And the live music is very enjoyable. Especially sitting outside just enhances the experience, beautiful restaurant and mall to shop at after!"}
{"text":"Today they just opened. We tried the soup , meatballs, chicken melanesse and eggplant rolatini. The eggplant is a must and all the food was excellent. So glad that they are here in downtown summerlin. This will be a regular for us. Welcome to the neighborhood! Staff is wonderful  and love the interior."}
{"text":"VISUAL AESTHETIC: 3/5 Trattoria Reggiano is located within Downtown Summerlin, right beside the Regal Cinemas. The sign is properly displayed and easy to find, while the parking lot is also convenient and just steps away from the restaurant itself.   This can be positive or negative, depending on the party dining, but the restaurant is coddled between the theatre and an adjacent restaurant while across the way is a set of buildings. Although this is the layout of the shopping center, the wall creates a short of \"block\" in the space for the outdoor patio seating.   The seating arrangement outdoors and indoors is quite small, and the bar has a wall that slices through it which divides the visible advantage of space. Tables are covered with a paper and have a cup of Crayons which offers a \"family friendly\" aspect for those that have children.   Overall, the atmosphere is average. The dining decor is comfortable, and the level of noise is also average.  FOOD: 1/5 It was my first time dining here. The reviews drew my mom and I to this restaurant and we decided to celebrate my birthday here. We wanted to take our time ordering as we expected to eat and drink for a prolonged period.   We ordered two martinis, which were fine, and we also picked two starters, the mussels and calamari. Just a clarification, the serving sizes were HUGE; our server DID NOT mention anything at all when we were ordering so we ended up full with the two appetizers alone.  We were given garlic knots and a plate of antipasto which contained cheese, olives, and cooked peppers. This was perhaps the best part of the meal because the mussels were not fresh. They were soggy and the meat lacked any texture other than \"mush\". The calamari was alright, but room temperature when we received it -- Which was 40 minutes after we ordered. The sauces for both of the dishes were nothing special, though we ordered the \"spicy\" sauce for the calamari which had no spice whatsoever and looked like it  came out of a can.  SERVICE: 1/5 The service here was awful, which is an understatement. Upon arrival, the hostess was extremely slow and chatty with the party before us. I understand customer service and catering to patrons, but there were people in line behind us. You cannot take fifteen minutes to seat one party and hang out to talk to them at their table when others are also waiting. This was unprofessional.  After we were finally seated, we didn't get to have a waitress until we had read over the entire food, drink, and wine menu several times. When she finally did show up, she made it obvious that she did not want to spend time at our table because we watched as she catered to every table around ours from getting drinks, refilling bread, to serving the actual entrees.   And this is picky of me, but every time I have ever been ID'd on my birthday, I am typically told \"Happy Birthday\"? I believe this is a typical service at most restaurants, but I suppose she didn't bother to actually look at my ID when she had asked for it, glancing and handing it back to me immediately.  We had stated that this was our first time at Trattoria Reggiano's and our server made no effort to tell us about the serving size of their portions. But had the audacity to come back later to ask if we wanted entrees. When we declined, she proceeded to say that she didn't think we would since she \"wanted us to see the amount of food for ourselves\". I was completely appalled at that sort of answer.  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 1/5 I have dined at other restaurants within Downtown Summerlin and this has to be one of the worst experiences I have had. The food was mediocre, the service was less than sub par, and this place really doesn't deserve the raving reviews that are going around online. I am completely disappointed and will not be returning to such an unprofessional restaurant."}
{"text":"Simple but eloquent dinning in an open area of the hotel.  Service was prompt professional and personal. Food was very specific in taste with a good selection of wine.  Server was helpful but not overbearing and attentive to needs.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm tired of wasting my time at sub par restaurants. The food was not very good and over priced. Ordered calamari was too salty and greasy. Then ordered the sausage pizza, when I picked up the first piece the entire contents of the pizza slid off onto the plate. The sausage slices were uneven and it just tasted bland. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Let me start with admitting that I've been here more times than my check-ins : I simply forget to because as soon as I arrive, I'm immediately hugged by (and happily hug back!) Paolo, who is my fave person at the restaurant  Paolo came to our table the first time we dined at Reggiano, and since then we have always dined in his section when possible; but even if we can't he and I always find time to greet each other and catch up!! I grew up in Milano (I'm an oil brat, my Dad worked for oil companies ) and Paolo is from northern Italy too, so we reminisce together... The FOOD: really good, honest, Italian food. Pasta cooked properly, al dente and not drowning in too much, overwhelming sauce. My fave is the Carbonara, but I've had excellent Spaghetti alle Vongole and other pastas.  As a starter, I'm very very partial to the Calamari: perfectly crispy, with a good ratio of rings to legs, and the lemon halves covered with an elasticated 'cheesecloth' so the seeds don't get on your calamari! Of course the Caprese is soooo good too, lovely tomatoes and creamy, luscious Burrata that melts in the mouth... mmmm, I can almost taste it !  Reggiano also has my fave cocktail and liquor, too : Negroni and Limoncello respectively. Without further ado, I wish you Buon Appetito"}
{"text":"I had the filet mignon giambotto and it was amazing, so tender it almost melted in the mouth.  The garlic bread you get as a starter was also great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italians restaurants in LV. Pretty much everything he is great. You can go wrong here."}
{"text":"I visited here recently and wow, so yummy! I was on a trip and went on a double date after reading the good reviews and choosing it after looking at several Italian restaurants in Vegas. For those who say it is hard to find, we did not have a problem at all. If anyone does, just ask a staff member! I give it 4 stars because we are all recent college grads and it was definitely pricier for us. We knew that walking in, but if you're used to Italian as Buca Di Beppo, Olive Garden, and even Dominos (lol), then you'll want to save this restaurant for your classy dinner. I also could be inaccurate with my rating considering we haven't tried any other \"nicer\" Italian restaurants in Vegas. For our meal, we had the filet migon meatballs as an appetizer, chicken parm, penne bolognese, and tortellini Alfredo. Those garlic knots were also incredibly! Large portion and enjoyed some leftovers. Overall, very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch today (a repeat visit from over 2 years ago).  Just as good as I remembered!  Reminded us of a of a local Trattoria in Rome, Italy that we visited in May 2013.  Great staff.  Thanks Amanda for all your help!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is literally a diamond in the rough.  Last year, we stopped here when we were craving pizza. We were blown away with what we ordered and this year we swore we would go back. Upon arriving in Vegas, this was literally the first place we went after checking in at the hotel.   We ordered a Margherita pizza to share, a glass of wine each, and also munched on the complimentary bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar). We were worried that our memories of the meal last year were clouded with time and we were building it up, only to be let down. No, no we weren't disappointed. Oh. My. Goodness. The pizza was a beautiful medley of cheese and sauce with the buffalo mozza standing out SO MUCH. We were so happy it was exactly what we were hoping for.  This small little restaurant is worth going out of your way for if you're looking for Italian or pizza. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Somewhere in the maze and warrens that is the combined Venice and Palazzo hotels just off the food court is Trattoria Reggiano. They are known for their filet mignon meatballs but their other dishes are also very good. You can order spaghetti and meatballs for your entrée but you are better off ordering the meatballs as an appetizer and get the lobster ravioli or other dishes for your main course. Make reservations, loud and friendly like an Italian family gathering."}
{"text":"This place was really expensive...but I think the food and service were worth it.  It's a very quaint little place, with a small \"inside\" and a few more tables just outside to give it that feeling of a little street-side Italian restaurant. Said tables are technically out in the shopping area, but it didn't feel like it.  Our server was great. He was actually honest about recommendations and would say something wasn't as good if we asked. He was attentive and friendly.  I went for a classic four-cheese pizza, which was enough for me and really could be shared between two people, which would help save you some dough. It was really tasty all around-good sauce, good crust, good cheese.  If you're around the Venetian and are looking for middle scale Italian restaurant, this is pretty solid choice."}
{"text":"Oh my...their bread was amazing though oily. But they were so soft and warm I couldn't stop eating them. When the main courses came out, I was almost full. I ordered a pasta dish with chicken and mushroom. The sauce was so good. The chicken was tender. My boyfriend had the beef spagetti. Both dishes had no fault. It is a small restaurant but very Italian like with the design and location. I loved coming here to spend the night having dinner here."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to dinner spot for every trip to Vegas when we actually have time for something more substantial than room service chicken strips or Earl's Sandwiches.  If you are always tight on time like we are in Vegas, order it to-go! Make sure you call about 30 minutes before you actually want to pick it up though as it does get busy here at dinner time as it's not a fast food joint. I'd love to sit and dine at this quaint little place in the Venetian if I could ever find time.  Fun little extra? All the workers have pretty thick Italian accents and are extremely friendly! Although it makes ordering via the phone a little difficult at times.  Both times I have gotten the Tortellini Alfredo. Medium chewy pieces of tortellini stuffed with delicious cheese in an extremely buttery cream sauce. The portion for this is a bit deceiving visually when you first get it, it seems small, but it will definitely fill you up! Plus, the free garlic knots that come with it are delicious and are a wonderful vehicle for you to scoop up any remaining sauce you have on your plate. YUMS  For 3 pasta entrees the total was around $55. Which for Vegas, isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local italian restaurant! The food is always consistently delicious and the complimentary garlic knots are to die for! Ricki, our regular server is the bestest. She always makes us feel welcome with her great big smile when she sees us. I just love her! She remembers all our favs and never messes up our order.  You cannot go wrong with any of their pasta dishes. Always comes perfecty al dente and they do not skimp of the sauces. The clams and shrimp are always fresh and cooked perfectly.  Love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Accessibility (Parking / Wait Time)  1/1 Star: wall ins only. I felt lucky because when I went there was no wait but packed. Got the last table. I didn't have to wait so I was happy, but I can see people waiting.   _____  Service (Waiter / Cleanness / Ambiance)  1/1 Star: normal service. Clean. Cozy. Pretty small place.  _____  Taste (0=Not Edible / 1=Edible / 2=Good (average) / 3=Must Try!)  2/3 Stars: thus place is really good overall! There wasn't just one thing that stuck out as a must try though.   _____  Overall Experience  4/5 Stars   _____  Last Words  Nice little place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner based on yelp reviews, and was not disappointed. The service and food were both fast and excellent. The place is small but they have tables outside extending into the grand canal shoppe hallway."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience, both food and service were superb!! The home made meatballs are phenomenal!! We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected at all after reading all the amazing reviews. I had couple of friends in town who wanted to do Italian on the strip. I yelped a place and this came up and seemed perfect. First, it took us forever to find the place A pretty well hidden. Then, the place was in reality small, lots of light, and there wasn't anything special about it. We didn't really care - we were there for a good Italian meal and to catch up.  Five stars for service - the service was actually good and everyone was nice and courteous at all times. Five stars For the tiramisu as well. Even though I am not a tiramisu person at all but that was the table's choice I loved it. It comes in a glass and the tiramisu part is really only on the bottom - there's something like a vanilla pudding/creme brûlée filling that was very tasty.  However, the food was ok. Just ok. Absolutely nothing special. We got couple of pizzas that were ok and my husband got the ny strip special ($60 meal) and described it as \"the worse steak\" he recently ate. For that kind of money you can get a real steak at a good steakhouse and go home happy. I did not completely hate the place but I will definitely not return."}
{"text":"Found this Italian restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  WOW!!  Authentic and so good.  It's a small place so either get there early or call ahead to check if its busy.  We were lucky and they had a table for 2 available when we got there at 6:30 but it was already pretty busy.  The waitstaff here is excellent and you can tell they are real Italians.  The food is fresh made and seems authentic.  Wine list was decent and we were able to find a nice bottle of red with dinner.  I tried the Chicken Parmigiana and it was quite good.  Portions were pretty good size as well.    I definitely recommend them if you are looking for an Italian place on the strip."}
{"text":"Really good food!!!  Gf pizza was awesome.  Crust was crisp and sauce excellent.  Chicken parmigiana was super good.  Caesar salad was amazing.  We'll be back here for sure"}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious can't even describe in words! Great service and best garlic bread ever!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food rocks!  The establishment itself is small and it's in a casual area of the Canal Shoppes.  But the Spaghetti Aglio e Olio for a vegetarian really rocks!  There are a number of other vegetarian options.  I believe my wife has ordered the Tortelloni Alfredo and that's really good.    Last time we were there we were with friends.  We ordered a bottle of cabernet sauvignon for the table.  I won't say any names, but our female friend poured her Pepsi into her cabernet sauvignon.  First off, I'm not sure why she ordered Pepsi.  Secondly, I'm not sure why she mixed the two but the pre-party might have had something to do with it.  Lastly, I had to try it out and it wasn't as bad as one might think.  Although, I still won't recommend that!  Order a bottle of wine and keep the Pepsi on the shelves!"}
{"text":"Just no. I don't understand how their ratings can be so high. Walking in for a late dinner we were sat immediately. The waiter took our drink order,food order and tossed them at the table like we were unwanted there or he was having a bad day. I ordered a shrimp scampi and when it arrived it did not looked the way I thought it would. They should change the name to stuff shrimps instead. It seriously taste like something from Olive Garden or Red Lobsters. Overpriced,horrible service and mediocre food. I just don't get it."}
{"text":"My partner and I love this restaurant for amazing Italian cuisine. Although it is a no-frills dining atmosphere, the authentic Italian food they serve is the best in Vegas. The prices are more reasonable than any other restaurant of the same caliber. The servings of pasta are always cooked perfectly al dente. In particular, we have ordered the Chicken Parmigiana and Chicken Francese on many occasions. The quality of food is consistent and never disappoints. The Chicken Parmigiana served here is as good as that served in Martarano's, a more upscale/pricey choice which also tops our list of great local Italian restaurants. Are you going? Prepare yourself for an absolutely delicious Italian meal."}
{"text":"Located inside the Venetian, where the shops are, around the corner from Barney's tucked in a little corner is a cute little Italian Restaurant called Trattoria Reggiano.  The tables decor consists of Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil.  This restaurant seats maybe 25 people tops with table in the restaurant tightly packed in and a few tables set up outside the restaurant in the mall area for you people watchers.  Yes, of course I'm a people watcher and who wouldn't want to be while your in Las Vegas.  I decided on the spaghetti and meatballs but as our server took his sweet time bringing us our waters, I had changed my mind and now it was set on a pizza.  They brought us bread which was really very good bread.  We made a dipping sauce with olive oil and balsamic vinegar which was on the table.  Holy Cow, that balsamic vinegar was delicious!  Our server said that the balsamic vinegar was brought in especially for this restaurant.  Very nice.  So, the table next to us ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  It looked and smelled fabulous.  I was pissed I didn't order it.  I know they ordered it to rub it in my face a little, just kidding.  Seriously it looked awesome.  As I sat there being mad at myself for changing my order last minute, here came our server with our food: Marghertia Pizza, Pizza with Pepperoni and Mushrooms, and the Tortellini Alfredo.  One word = Delicious.    The food was really good!  I highly recommend this place.  Our server was from, Siciliy and was extremely authentic.  If you are shopping at the Venetian and your stomach starts to growl, check this place out.  One thing I did pick up on while I was in Las Vegas.... the Italian food is absolutely amazing.  I will definitely return to this restaurant on my next vacation to Las Vegas!  Cheers and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was delicious! I've had the chicken parm, baked ziti, fettuccine Alfredo, lasagna, and spaghetti. So good! Cannoli was so creamy and crunchy, yum! Vodka-tonic was nice and stiff, just the way I like it, lol! Service was great with a short haired blonde lady. In the end, thoroughly enjoyed and will be back again."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night during our stay in Vegas, didn't need a reservation for a group of four which was nice. It's a small, intimate style restaurant. Really good for dates or for a quiet dinner with a small group. They offer a large selection of wines and a few cocktails.   Our server was really cool. At first seemed a little grumpy but loosened up during our meal. Their menu pricing is a bit on the higher end, so come prepared. Two of the members in the group got a pizza. Both of the pizzas were really good. Large portions, we had enough left over to take home. I ordered the shrimp scampi, the shrimp were crispy and stuffed with a delicious stuffing. The pasta itself was amazing. I never finish my meal, but this time I did. Every. Last. Bite. The food tastes especially good with some crushed red pepper.   Overall, a good place in the Palazzo to have an ambient dinner."}
{"text":"Hubby brought me here for my birthday last yr . The food was delicious and has a nice view of gondolas . We each had a pasta it was tasty ."}
{"text":"The food here is ridiculously tasty. Prices aren't bad for what you get ! Tried the baked ziti and pizza. Can't wait to come back for some calamari"}
{"text":"Garlic Knots to start were great, and i had high hopes. I ordered chicken milanese and it was completely overcooked and dry. The server didn't apologize and gave me a look as if I should have eaten it. I ordered eggplant parm instead and it was okay. We probably won't be back. They definitely need a new chef!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for a nice lunch date with my love, it was good. We sat outside on the patio and being the oven that we are it was surprisingly cool. They have fans and air conditioning I believe ( I felt cold air coming no out of the vents) Any-who. We brought our dog with us and was also surprised that they are dog friendly although the hostess/waitress didn't offer water for her. My SO ordered the pizza margarita and I the meatball sub with fries. The pizza was okay could've been cooked longer at the bottom and the crust was a bit chewy for our liking as well but the rest was like I said okay. The meatball sub however was on point . Crusty bread, tender meatballs in a well seasoned sauce, delicious melty cheese and the crispest fries I've had in a long time. The waitress was very nice. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yes it took some laps in order to find this place :)   Placed an order to go. Angie at the bar was amazing! Super friendly, upbeat, and full of menu knowledge and recommendations.   There are six cozy (small) 4-person booths. Then table seating inside and \"outside\" (out Front does look like outside).   There was Latin dancing music on, which I found amusing. Not too loud tho so didn't really notice. There is a TV showing sports over the bar.  Chicken parm was pretty big. And Angie said it was smaller than the spaghetti and meatballs :o  Packed nicely, with cutlery, napkin, and rolls. Took under 5 min and I was served an ice water while waiting.   #winning"}
{"text":"The hosts and waiters were all very nice. I got their Spaghetti Aglio e Olio with a side of Angus Beef filet mignon meatballs - very good..."}
{"text":"Wow! A little behind on reviewing this restaurant but I still wanted to leave a review--that's how impressed I was. I really want to thank our waiter for being INCREDIBLY sweet and kind. He checked up on us and was just the nicest waiter I've ever met. I only wish I got his name so I could mention him!  My first impression of the restaurant was that it was a little different. We sat \"outside\" which was next to where people walked and we couldn't really experience the interior design of the restaurant--but it was still nice.   We started with the infamous filet mignon meatballs which were perfect for two girls who starved themselves before dinner. The meatballs melted in your mouth and the leftover sauce made for great dipping sauce for the amazing garlic rolls (ask for seconds!!). We got two pastas each: a lobster ravioli and another pasta I can't remember the name to. The second pasta was actually one with NO sauce and being really picky eaters, my cousin and I were thankful for the \"no sauce\". Things can get a little heavy when you have ravioli and meatballs (plus drinks!).  100% would come again just for the meatballs!"}
{"text":"I guess maybe it was an off night but this place was Not Good The service was terrible and we were almost the only customers there The server gave us a strange look for asking for more water The salad was drowning in sauce and it was too vinegary The garlic knots tasted funny and we were not offered more so Unlimited was not mentioned The veal was huge that was actually the best part but the Bolognese sauce was bland and unexciting They for got to bring my wine and came back twice without it then overheard us talking about it almost at the end of the meal and then asked if I wanted wine By then I was over this entire meal Sorry would not do this again I wish we would have went to OTTO's but it was packed The only good thing about this place was that we go in quickly Was probably a sign to not eat there Lesson learned"}
{"text":"My family & I kind of just stumbled across this gem in the Venetian Hotel.  Unfortunately, half their seating sits right out in the pathway of walkers through the shopping area.  But the food atop of the diner's plates was too alluring.  We sat inside (which is pretty cramped).  Our waiter was pleasant and attentive.  He brought us their complimentary Garlic Knots.  While on the greasy side, they were awesome!  As an appetizer, my family and I ordered the Fried Calamari.  This could have been a meal for one.  Luckily we shared it.  Unfortunatley, it was a bit too fried.  The sauce that accompanied the Calamari was good, but I wouldn't have minded had it been spicier.  We ordered two personal pizzas to share.  Although the pizzas are thin, they are large in diameter and declicious.  We ordered a Margarita pizza and a Prosciutto pizza.  While the Margarita was good, the Prosciutto pizza was excellent.   Overall, our experience was very good.  The food was plentiful and very tasty.  The staff was cordial.  Endulge on the Garlic Knots and pizzas."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to eat here for years! Glad I finally did. Filet Mignon meatballs, lobster ravioli, seafood linguine....everything was delicious! And the service was great!"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice in the past week...so kind of speaks to my feelings..  Great food...good service...and the vibe and energy are awesome.  I can sit outside in the warmth of the evening, enjoy great food...great music...and enjoy the end of the day.  I will continue to come back..."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp I decided to bring my family here after seeing Phantom.  It's a small, homey, simple place that you wouldn't expect to find inside the Venetian.  The staff was all Italian and so friendly.  The food was amazing!  You must try the meatballs.  They were so good we ended up getting 2 orders.  We all loved everything we ordered: baked ziti, penne puttanesca, pizza, and spaghetti aglio & olio.  We were too full for dessert and our bill came out to about $90.  We were all pleasantly satisfied and saying how we would definitely come back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"average, I would have given it a 3 1/2 stars.  decent food, but nothing special.  May give it another try bc I have heard good things about it."}
{"text":"This is my father's favorite restaurant, so of course we had to come for father's day dinner!   My family and I prefer this location compared to the Venetian Canal Shop's location.   Hilda was our server and she was a pleasure to order from!   I have ordered the white wine linguine in the past and the penne al a vodka this time around. I will say I preferred the linguine and I can't wait to order it again in the future. Granted, both dishes were DELICIOUS. The one draw back is I love angel hair pasta and it is not an option on the menu nor as a pasta substitute.  I also ordered the Morning Spritz cocktail which is an Italian staple. Trattoria always prepares it just right, with it being the perfect bitter to sweet ratio... not to mention how refreshing it is! The best summer cocktail in my opinion, so good that I wish it came in a bigger glass!   For desert I ordered the carrot cake which had beautiful layers of cream cheese frosting. It was a lovely end to my meal and I saved half of it for later!!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best restaurant!  The food is outstanding, the service is amazing and they have the best bartender ever - Bethany!  Truly every dish I've ever had was out of this world!  The meatballs - you'll never want them from anywhere else.  The Italian Kale Salad - you'll be craving it for days.  The cheesecake and carrot cake - wear pants with elastic waistbands because you'll be licking the plate clean.  This restaurant is a must when friends/family come to visit.  Come, enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here last night with a group of 5. This place is set up as high end Italian restaurant, the spaghetti and meatballs are $22. With this said, we had to ask multiple times for glasses of water and were told the long wait was due to not having enough glasses cleaned. Two of the five dinners were wrong and instead of redoing them they simply brought new incorrect sauce on the side. The bread was cold by the time we received it and half of it burnt. The live music was great but management has some work to do with service and good quality especially with the prices being so high."}
{"text":"Absolutely, delicious. It is tucked away in a nook in the Venetian so you definitely have to ask or be on the look-out for it. The portions are large so unless you are a huge eater, you may want to share 1 entree with another person. The price is reasonable and definitely cheaper than any other Italian restaurant in the Venetian or Bellagio. The only thing that prevented this place from being 5 stars is the calamari was mediocre and service is a little slow since there is 1 server running around managing 7+ two tops. Otherwise, we'll definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"Recently visited here on a date night. Restaurant was very busy and service was quite good. We had an appetizer of calamari, pizza di Parma and I had the Veal Francese with pasta. The calamari was pretty good, pizza was good and the veal was just meh. There was an odd taste to the sauce on the veal and the veal wasn't as tender as I'm used to. The real reason for the low review is based on the price. If you're going to charge nearly $40 for a plate of pasta then the dish had better be spectacular. Our meal was $75 for two entrees and an appetizer (we drank water) and the food was anything but special. I can't see coming back with those prices to try anything else."}
{"text":"We wanted a nice Italian meal so we set out for this restaurant at the Venitian. First of all, our waitress Hilda was so sweet and helpful. We had people in our party that spoke a mix of languages and so did she! After helping me decide what to get, I was glad I took her advice. You really can't go wrong with chicken parmesan! Everyone else was very happy with the food and amazed by the service. We met the manager Dora who also spoke many languages and was very welcoming. It was a really wonderful experience and I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Okay, I know it says I'm at the Venetian but I'm actually at their new location in downtown Summerlin. Everything was great or exceptionally good. From the compt garlic knots and olive tray. To the eggplant parmesan and the chicken parmesan. The carrot cake was perfect and moist not to mention huge. This is my new favorite Italian restaurant. Robert was very knowledgeable on all of the menu items."}
{"text":"Service was just ok. Waiter Zeki was good but the wait for food is long!  I got chicken parmigiano,  which was so-so.  Spaghetti side was ok but not special.  I thought it was pricey at $26.  Hubs ordered penne Primavera which was also just ok.  There are way too many good Italian places in Vegas (Italian American Club, Casa di Amore,  Mastrioni) for us to go back here again!   Very busy place,  crowded and our table seemed in the way of the servers,  although we had reservations.  I wanted to like this place but I'm afraid not!"}
{"text":"great food we enjoyed our meal greatly. the atmosphere is very loud out on the patio. reasonable price for vegas."}
{"text":"Looking at some photos of food from a year ago on here, the food is nothing like that anymore. The garlic knots are pasty and undercooked, the pizza soggy, the meatballs under mixed and the spaghetti sauce way watered down, on both the pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. Very disappointing! If an Italian restaurant can't make a well-mixed juicy meatball and serve it in a fragrant thick and tasty sauce, then it fails as an Italian restaurant in my view..."}
{"text":"We ate on the patio on late Sunday afternoon.  It took quite a while for the waiter to come to our table.  The drinks came fast.  The garlic knots were just ok and took forever.  They were dripping with butter.  I like butter, but it was too much for me. The food showed up 30 seconds after the bread finally showed up. We had spaghetti with meatballs which was good but overpriced and a chicken dish, which was good.   The server never checked back and took forever to get the bill much less offer dessert."}
{"text":"Actually called this place by accident, was trying to get the other Italian place in town. Anyway called to order a pizza with salami on it, they said no LOL, what kind of Italian restaurant will not put salami on a pizza?  FAKE ITALIANS THATS WHO.  Definitely not ever going to eat there"}
{"text":"Great staff. Nice quaint environment. Delicious salad and margarita pizza. This is our usual stop when at the convention."}
{"text":"Just strolled in here randomly looking for something to eat before watching a movie at Regal next door. First impression was that the restaurant itself is really beautiful. Open kitchen and bunch of open doors leading inside from the patio seating.  Minno was our server and he was super italian and very friendly. I mean like super Mario level italian. Like thats a spicy meat a ball level italian.   My mother and I had the Calamari, caesar salad, and the Margerita with proscuitto pizza (cant remember exact name).  The complimentary garlic bread was delicious with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The calamari was honestly the best I think Ive ever had. Definitely using really fresh squid. Batter was light and crispy and most importantly the meat was still perfectly cooked and tender and the Marinara dipping sauce was amazing. I literally cleaned the whole plate.  Caesar salad was really good too, they are using high quality ingredients here and it makes a world of difference. Beware of the anchovy garnish though because it was intensely salty, do not eat in one bite like I did.  The pizza was honestly the most unimpressive part, I dont know if it was because I was so damn full already which definitely affects how tasty something is, but I just wasnt blown away. Still not bad by any means. Granted I did eat two garlic knots, half a caesar salad, and 75% of the calamari before even tasting the pizza though..  I want to try the pasta dishes next time because they look amazing, and this place is definitely on the more authentic side so Im sure they taste legit too.  If youre at this mall, eat here."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Just a small restaurant, so don't come with a party over six people."}
{"text":"The olives, reggiano cheese and peppers along with garlic bread knots with $$ balsamic vinegar & Olive oil were a great segway to my Chiken Parmesan which was excellent, and no one person could finish, I tried!  My friend along with other customers bragged about the meatballs made with steak. My girlfriend raved about the lobster ravioli in a cream sauce with chunks of lobster. Anytime I want a delicious Italian cuisine, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I spent a weekend in vegas with our family and decided to have a date night out on the strip. After a show at the Palazzo, we decided to have a nice dinner afterwards at the Venetian. After bumbling through the over priced and busy restaurants, we came across this little trattoria. The menu options and prices upon first glance were exactly what we were looking for. We were seated promptly and our server Paolo was wonderful. He was so sweet and made the effort to get my girlfriend an extra napkin as she was wearing a white dress and he didn't want it to get stained. Our table had a paper covering and some crayons, so we colored and it was a very fun and cute way to wait in between our food. We were started off with the most amazing garlic knots I have ever had, did I mention they were complimentary?! I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and my girlfriend got the margherita pizza. The portions were on the larger size, even for the low price. The filet mignon used in the bolognese made all the difference and was the most remarkable pasta I had ever had. The pizza was a personal size, but again a little bigger as I had to end up helping my girlfriend eat some, and we were still left with some slices to take home! The fresh cheese and beautiful, bright tomatoes were fantastic on the pizza. For dessert we had the cannoli and some coffee. Both were equally as delicious and satisfying, and were a wonderful way to wrap up our meal. I look forward for my next visit to vegas, so that I can enjoy this wonderful trattoria once again!"}
{"text":"Compared to other restaurants on the strip, it offered a decent value for a quality meal.  The bread is excellent--better than most free breads I've had at Italian joints, and they provide it in copious quantities at exactly the right price of zero.  The atmosphere is a little mall/foodcourty (then again, so is all of Vegas), but the food is definitely well above that caliber.  The meatballs are made out of filet mignon, so expect some high end protein in your spaghetti.  They also make legit carbonara--no canned cream sauce.  It's a hair off four stars; it would make the cut if the ambiance was a little nicer.  I would eat here again if I ever make it back to Vegas, but I hope to avoid that."}
{"text":"Excellent !! Best pasta Faggioli I've had in a restaurant and the pasta was actually Al Dante and I didn't have to ask.. I had the linguini Bolognese. Very good sauce ."}
{"text":"Super amazing food! The gnocchi to the eggplant and pizza even... everything was spot on! The gnocchi especially was my favorite. The pesto sauce was smooth and rich with flavor."}
{"text":"Not divine and bread seemed like day old. Not for foodies and like being in the food court -only a bit away from it. Sat in hallway, next to magic shop where fortune telling machine kept bellowing for someone to notice it."}
{"text":"Our server Zeki was GREAT! We shared the eggplant, caprese and filet mignon meatball appetizers for our meal. It was not only delicious but also filling and we had enough leftovers to take home for another meal.   The outdoorsy atmosphere was beautiful, but there was only ONE bathroom for the whole restaurant and it was unisex. That seemed a little crazy to me."}
{"text":"With all the Italian restaurants in the Venetian, this one is a definite \"will not return\" in my book. There are so many other, more tasty options at the same price point just steps away.   I got the spaghetti and meatballs as other yelp reviewers raved about it, but it was really just mediocre. The sauce and meatballs were altogether flavorless. The only saving grace of the meal was the garlic knots.   The atmosphere here is also just mediocre, as it's not in the main atrium area by the canal. The other Italian restaurants around the corner have both a better view and better food."}
{"text":"We tried their Veal. I had the veal parmagain and my wife had the veal scaloppini. Both were outstanding!  Meatball appetizer was delicious. The desserts were to die for.  Service was excellent! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The service was great. Great atmosphere. I am a big fan for Italian for. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. Romantic and was very nice. Food was really god. Reasonably priced I think. Cause it was my birthday I got a free cannoli which was amazing."}
{"text":"Barely average. My linguine in clam sauce was incredibly salty, and the lasagna was nothing special. Portions were small as well. Garlic knots were bland, but cheese on them was good. Overall, not worth the price."}
{"text":"huge fan of their food ,their taste is more authentic and less cheesy ...... i eat there everytime i go to vegas !!!! ......."}
{"text":"Great all-around Italian Ristorante tucked inside The Venetian. It's a little hard to find, but it's well worth it. It's also not very big, but they managed our 12 person party with ease. Service throughout was very friendly and attentive. Dinner started out with some complimentary buttery garlic rolls... delicious. Everything on the menu seems competitively priced and very affordable; which for Vegas is a plus. If I had to compare, I'd say it's most similar to an Olive Garden or Maggiano's, which is hardly a knock. I went with the vodka penne with grilled chicken breast. The dish with solid, noodles were al dente, and chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection. We tried a few different desserts, every one of which was freaking delicious. The ricotta cheesecake was ridiculous, and a must for diners with room left. Every person in our party had a great time thanks to the well prepared food and hospitable staff. I definitely recommend them if you're not looking to blow $100 a plate, and still have some great food.... with almost guaranteed leftovers!"}
{"text":"Us: \"Cheers! Yay for yummy food, wine, and good times!\" (as we scarf down our amazing food) Waiter: \"You're done with your plate, right? Grazie.\" (as we're still picking at our plates) Us:  \"Uhhh, sure...\" (as the waiter takes our food away) Manager: (stares at us and hovers over our table every 3 minutes) Us: (stare back at him while we're trying to have a good time) Us: (finish our wine and conversation, and get up to leave the table) Manager: \"Oh, grazie, grazie! Come again, come again.\" (as he sweeps off our table and gets ready to seat another group) Us: \"WTF was that?!\" (as our faces contort out of confusion and frustration)  Everything started off really well with the super-cute \"it's like i'm in an Italian family's kitchen\" setting, the waiter's charming accent, and the aroma of garlic and bread. Food was yummy, that's for sure. BUT service started to decline during the middle of our meals when the staff started playing a game of clean-up.  It was amusing, but irritating at the same time. I totally understand the restaurant business and the need to turn over tables to seat new people, but don't push the damn people out, sheesh!  I will likely not be back to this place. Bummer."}
{"text":"After reading several glowing reviews on Yelp, and viewing several tantalizing photos of a wide selection of classic Italian dishes, I had wanted to sample the offerings of this small restaurant along the Grand Canal Shoppes for awhile, but more than once had found it to be completely filled with diners.  At last, after attending a law conference nearby, after about a 15-minute wait Diane and I were ushered to a table for two looking onto a cavalcade of passersby.  Here we took our time sharing a late-night dinner.  We began with very garlicky large Garlic Rolls and a not too cheesy, not too saucy, and fairly thin Salsiccia Pizza, followed by a tasty bowl of Pasta e Fagioli Soup with big Cannelloni Beans.  Then, while Diane enjoyed Tortelloni Alfredo, I savored very good medallions of Veal Marsala along with first-rate Fettuccine Alfredo topped by fresh Parmigiana Cheese.  In a city filled with innumerable fine Italian restaurants, among them Trattoria Reggiano definitely holds its own."}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent. I was looking for good authentic ilalian food. I was not disappointed in the slightest. My only problem was the table was too small to hold all that goodness. Everytime something new came we had to shuffle the the plates and glasses. This is now one of my favorite restaurants. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Felt like we were sitting in a small restaurant in Italy. Highly recommended for everyone. Service was great."}
{"text":"To be fair, my wife and I were not expecting the highest level of food and service when we reserved a table for dinner at Trattoria Reggiano.  We had already eaten a couple of the celebrity chef venues in the Venetian / Palazzo complex over the prior few days.  Rather, we were just looking for tasty food and good service at a presumed slightly lower price point.  Our waitress was also working behind the service bar, was very pleasant but either not trained or focused on the task at hand.  We were seated at a booth with settings for four.  The extra settings were never removed, (we finally stacked them to the side) we asked to split a salad and ordered two pasta dishes as our main courses.  After a short wait, the salad came with no plates for splitting with the main courses arriving  within a minute after.  I asked that they take the pasta dishes back until we completed our salads, but immediately realized that the dishes would just sit in the back until we asked for them, so we hurried through our salads and flagged down a server to have them returned a few minutes later.  (The table was never cleared of salad plates until the end of our meal)  We ordered a bottle of wine with our dinner, (reasonably priced compared to some of the other venues in this complex) but other than the initial pour, it was self service after, which I'm fine with,  just unusual to not have a waiter or waitress offer to pour more when the glasses are sitting empty even in a restaurant of this level.  The food was OK, safe, unimaginative.  My wife's Lasagna was somewhat dry, (even a little Marinara poured over the top would have shown effort) and the best description that I could come up with for my dish was Hamburger Helper on steroids.  It was (Supposedly Tenderloin) ground beef mixed with marinara sauce over pasta.  The sauce was flavorless, one step above tomato sauce out of the can with a few dry spices added to it..    All that including the wine and tip (yes, I still tipped the waitress 20% since she was pleasant and I truly felt she was just poorly trained) was $130.00 for the two of us.  The manager came by at he end of our meal and asked how our meal was.  I told him very nicely that it was disappointing and overall not what we expected.   He started to offer to get us another dish, but honestly, we had discounted that option earlier since we didn't really see much hope that the food or service would change with a different dish.  I politely declined and he mumbled a thank you for joining us as he walked away.  I'm by no description a food snob.  I've been served much worse, and obviously for many their food is very satisfying.  I personally would chose a dinner at Carrabba's any day over this restaurant in the future if I had the option.....hands down."}
{"text":"I had the mushroom ravioli and it was simply divine.  Great place to grab a hearty lunch before taking the shops by storm!  The manager or owner (middle-aged Italian[?] gentleman) ensured we had remarkable service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my meal. The calamari was breaded to the point one could not taste the calamari  The scampi and linguine was dripping in oil. I felt I needed an oil change after eating it. I love Italian food. Unfortunately, this was not the place to get it. At least the meal I ordered. Service was OK"}
{"text":"Oh MY God. I love this place..  We decided to duck into the Venetian for some food, after wandering the strip all morning, and ended up here. We didn't want to take leftovers since we weren't headed back to the hotel room for a while so we ordered a dish to share. The Eggplant Parmigiana was delicious! The dish was the perfect size for 2 people, especially since they give you DIVINE complimentary bread to munch on while you wait for your food. Divine! Divine, I say!  The place is really small, only has 6-8 booths & tables inside and about the same number crammed into a space outside. The slight cramped-ness adds to the cozy feel though, I really liked the decor and atmosphere. The walls are lined with pictures of old-time Italian people (just like Buca di Beppo, except better because it's not like the \"Illustrated Archives of Italy, c. 1800-1950\" threw up on the walls like at Buca...of course the food here is 20x better as well).   The staff are really great, friendly and attentive without being overbearing. It's funny, our waitress so resembled a b&w picture of an Italian woman on the wall that we wondered if they were related. We forgot to ask though!  The cannoli was amazing. Our waitress gave us a great suggestion for wine too, and they were really nice about the fact that the mister brought in his own beer that we picked up at a bar on the strip. They even gave him a proper mug for it so he wouldn't have to keep drinking it out of a plastic cup!  Next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Should have left when we sat down to notice the silverware was dirty and bread plates not clean.  Appetizer of eggplant rotini was actually good but the rest was mediocre.  Arugula with cherry tomato salad was a generous pile of arugula but only 5 halves of under ripe cherry tomatoes.  The waiter recommended the baked ziti with meatballs.  It was swimming in cheese and didn't have much sauce.  That was probably a good thing since the sauce it did have was on the sweet side.  The meatballs with it were bland but ok.  Hubby is a chicken parm addict but he barely touched what they served him, also because the sauce was sweet.  Wine list has nothing under $40.  The wines they have are marked up four times retail.  They were out of the first two bottles we ordered.  The Meomi we buy for $17 in the store is $15/glass or $55/bottle.  Ferrari Cab was $55 too.  Over-priced for a casual spot like this.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and reasonably priced for Vegas!  You can't get better than that...  Had the linguini carbonara and it was truly the best i've ever had.  The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente.  This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Good food, and they had a little music setup on the patio.  Nice place to people watch, although a bit hot with this Vegas weather."}
{"text":"We love this place!!!!! Shrimp Scampi is delicious. !!! Our waiter, Eric, is here every time we come and we love him!!!!! Everyone has to try this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Great food and service. Kid friendly as well. Reasonable prices for food and alcohol. Filet mignon meatballs are as advertised."}
{"text":"Food - ok Service - ok Menu - ok  So, it was ok, but for the overpriced pirice, I expect a lot more."}
{"text":"It was a Wednesday and we took my older sister to Dave & Buster's. Their happy hour didn't start until 9 and we were hungry so we decided to look for somewhere to eat nearby. Of course we checked yelp and this place drew our attention. It looks rather small on the inside, there was a bar, and outside seating. It was a nice night so we decided to go with the outdoor tables. We got seated right away and the atmosphere was really nice. There was live music and the lady who was singing was awesome. She made the experience really fun and enjoyable. My sister and I wanted to share so we ordered the specialty salad and a pasta. The waitress brought us garlic knots to start, delicious and soft!!! Don't forget to dip it in the oil and vinegar. The salad came out right after and it was huge! Enough to feed three people. They also split the pasta into two bowls for us (how nice, we didn't even ask). The food was tasty we finished it all and it was very filling. We enjoyed this place very much."}
{"text":"I don't easily give out 5-star reviews but this place rocks! Great service, great food, and great ambience - you couldn't ask for anything more. Even their simple garden salad with balsamic vinegar was delicious and I don't even like salads!"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the strip at $3.50 a slice. I love, love this place. They have a wonderful pizza that is a thicker crust (the way I like it). The atmosphere is causal, the service is good and the food is perfect! They have a wonderful bruchetta that is amazing. It is loaded with tomatoes and worth trying!"}
{"text":"OK, so I am not one that reviews very often...I will make this short and sweet. YOU GOTTA TRY THIS PLACE! Prior to this weekend Mastrioni's on Hualapai was my #1 for Italian Cuisine. My son had the Chicken Parm and I had the Linguini Bolognese and it was fantastic! Split the Spumoni and it was most excellent! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Eric is the best ever! He took great care of us! He even put up with our \"high-maintenance\" requests! If you don't go for anything else, you have to have the meatballs!!! I can't leave LV without the Filet Mignon Meatballs! Need I say more?!?"}
{"text":"Amazing again, it's been a year since we visited Dora at the Trattoria Reggiano. They've expanded without losing the intimate home kitchen feel. Dora made a strong balanced delicious Italian Sangria for us. The spaghetti puttanesca was full of capers, slices of garlic, kalamata olives, and fresh herbs. The garlic roll rivals the best garlic bread in any restaurant, lavishly brushed with butter and garlic. The bucatini frutti di mare is full of flavorful seafood, clams, shrimp, and little calamari. Of course, the lasagna al forno and spaghetti and meatballs are savory with fresh garlicky tomato sauce that you will want to soak up with the garlic rolls. Everything is fresh and simple, great basics make this Italian eatery a primary stop in the Venetian. It's easily comparable to Buddy V's, Carnevino, Maggiano's or any of the Italian pizzerias in the area. Dora, the manager, always stops by to kindly chat and make fantastic food recommendations. At the end of the meal, save room for a caramel drizzled cannoli and espresso or cappuccino.  July 2016 - We arrived late in the night but they were happy to seat us. We had the antipasto and Sangria with complimentary garlic bread. It was a beautiful presentation. Paulo took the best care of us. We felt like familia. Grazie."}
{"text":"This is a great Italian restaurant located right inside the Venetian.  I definitely had to get myself to \"not judge a book by its cover\" with this little joint because on the outside (to me at least) it looks like a strip mall food court venue.  Once you step in however, the service and care that is given to both the patrons and foods really makes you feel loved.  The Garlic Rolls are wonderful, soft and flavorful and quite honestly you can really get filled up fast on them, so be careful!  I had the Spaghetti with Bologna, noodles were perfectly firm to the touch and the sauce was very fulfilling.    My wife had the clam linguini and they did NOT skim on the clams at all--I think that probably will get a good 5-7 more clams than you're normally used to !!  I must say however that the dessert is nothing to write home about, I was really having a sweet tooth and decided to splurge on dessert.  Bad Idea IMO, the $8 dollars could've been better spent elsewhere, the cannoli I ordered was way too rich and dense that I really need coffee to break it down.  Next time I come here, I will skip the dessert and save they money.  All in all the dessert was the only downside and it wasn't that big of an issue, just don't get it :) 4 out of 5 stars, great service, great food, great place to get lost in!!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. My lobster ravioli was awesome. Great service, they don't rush you.  Restaurant is very busy, so call before to book a table."}
{"text":"The best Italian food ever... We had margarita pizza, lobster ravioli and clam and linguine and loved every bite!"}
{"text":"i quite like this place. it's like eating at a hole in the wall -- except you're at the venetian, and the prices show it. however, i like it the atmosphere, the staff, the food... it's run like a small family restaurant.  this is my favorite place to go when i'm in the area. that's not very often, though, so i have no recommendations, though."}
{"text":"Came in from dc and looking for good italian on the strip. Yelp came through again! Food was off the hook! Filet mignon meatballs and pesto ricotta gnocchi were top notch. Cost is about half the other places in the area. Search this place out, it's worth it!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine and impeccable service. The portions are very generous and although this location is in Downtown Summerlin it is still very ambient. They are very warm and welcoming and if not for the fact it is pricy they would get 5 stars. I understand you need to cover overhead but price gauging because you're in Summerlin is tacky. If you want to splurge for a great meal or have deep pockets-GO FOR IT!!!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time! Great service, super fast, and amazing food! Absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"This is the most incredible Italian restaurant in all of Las Vegas! The evening entertainment is fabulous (we really enjoy Mark Giovi) and the food is superb!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent filet and lobster ravioli. Definitely the highlight. Not the greatest atmosphere compared to others but the food alone is worth it."}
{"text":"Wow--thank you fellow Yelpers for recommending this restaurant. I stayed at The Venetian Resort in Las Vegas this week and did a bit of research regarding their restaurants before traveling there. I then checked Yelp to see what was written about them--everyone was spot on! The Trattoria Reggiano was just what I was looking for--their eggplant parmigiana and baked ziti were wonderful. The garlic rolls that start things out are fabulous but also very filling , so go easy on them. I wish their wine selection was a bit broader though. I did enjoy a \"Nero d'Avolo\" (Sicilian wine) by the glass which was quite tasty--but, their selections overall were really limited.  We split a large cannoli for dessert and had a few Peroni's to wash everything down. Italian is spoken there--cool!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Trattoria Reggiano for a group lunch and from start to finish the meal was anything but exceptional.  The restaurant was pretty empty the entire time, but despite this fact service was not as attentive as I would expect.   We ordered a number of appetizers for the table to share, including meatballs, calamari and caprese salad. I only tried the meatballs and caprese salad, neither of which  were remarkable in the least.   For my entree I decided to steer clear of the pastas and pizzas and offered the salmon with vegetables. Both the vegetables and salmon lacked flavor and I had no desire to eat everything.   The whole table seemed unimpressed with their food so I wasn't alone in my assessment. I don't see myself returning for any reason."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Vegas my husband and I were looking on Yelp for an Italian restaurant that was in walking distance of our hotel. Upon seeing the reviews and pictures about Trattoria Reggiano we were both sold. I wasn't thrilled that it happened to be located in the Venetian's Grand Canal Shops. I don't like that hotel and I don't like malls. However I will endure a lot for good food. As predicted walking through the Grand Canal Shops in search of Trattoria Reggiano was beyond unpleasant. Vendors and merchants were harassing us and when we paused to consult the directory/map an employee dressed like a Carabinieri offered to show us where the restaurant was. He walked us back towards the direction we had come from and pointed to the WRONG restaurant. Major fail. We ended up walking in a giant circle before Trattoria Reggiano nestled off in a side enclave near a Coffee Bean and the Houdini Shop.   The waitors here are all older Italian gentlemen. They notice customers  and announce how long the wait will be. There is no hostess or sign up sheet. We were told it would be a few minutes as a couple tables paid and got bussed and exactly a few minutes later we were shown to our table. The inside area seats about 20 and there are small tables outside too that probably seat another 20. It's very small compared to the Cucina across the way that was EMPTY!"}
{"text":"Decided on Trattoria Reggiano for dinner last night based on the Yelp reviews and my fiance and I absolutely loved it! The waiters were incredibly sweet older Italian gents who were all attentive and friendly. We ordered the special (last night it was handmade cheese ravioli topped with buffalo milk mozzarella) and the gnocchi al pesto. Both dishes were flavorful and the fresh pasta for both dishes was amazing. The gnocchi was up there with the best I've ever had, the texture was creamy and a little chewy (exactly how gnocchi should be!). The pesto was creamy but not too rich. The meal also started out with garlic knots, mmm! We ended with a piece of the seven layer chocolate cake. I rarely get dessert but this cake was pretty good. A little too rich for my taste (ended up having to take half of it with us) but it was still very decadent and moist.   A+ food and A+ service. I loved this adorable little restaurant and will be back the next time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend picked this place out for our last Vegas dinner before flying home. It's a tiny restaurant in the Venetian. I absolutely loved it.  First--the garlic olive oil bread they give you is absolutely amazing. Just amazing.  Second- The portions are HUGE!! I  Third - I loved the service.  My boyfriend and I decided to split the Linguine Bolognese for $18 and Salsiccia Pizza for $15.   The Linguine Bolognese was great. You can taste the quality of the beef and the sauce was great.  The pizza was amazing too, I ate that thing up so damn fast! Complete fatty status.  We nearly ordered an appetizer as well but thank goodness we didn't because we wouldn't have finished our entrees!   We also ordered 2 glasses of their red wine. They really fill those glasses up! It was much appreciated!  NOM NOM NOM I'm so happy my boyfriend picked this place. It's such a cute place for a dinner date without having to get all fancy. Love it!"}
{"text":"This restaurants was overall \"alright.\"   I can't really put my finger on the ambiance. It's like they're trying to be a fancy Italian restaurant with white table cloths. But then the Dean Martin and Michael Buble blaring from the speakers, along with the sound of pounding coming from the kitchen (meat tenderizing? I'm not sure but it was really loud) really threw it off.   I started with a glass of wine - they don't tell you what brand the wines by the glass are, but the cabernet sauvignon I ordered tasted an awful lot like two-buck chuck.   The garlic knots were good. We ordered the filet mignon meatballs to start, but they really weren't anything special. There was nothing interesting about their texture or the way they tasted. The sauce was flat in taste and more watery / homogenous than I would have liked. I ordered the linguine carbonara, which was fine, but was a little soggier / less al dente than I would have liked. My date had the chicken parmegiana, which was also a bit on the \"soggy\" side.   Vegas is sorely lacking in pasta places and this satisfied my craving for pasta (brought on by Olive Garden commercials on repeat on Hulu.. and I flat out refuse to go to Olive Garden)... but it won't be somewhere I make a special trip for."}
{"text":"Nettes Restaurant inmitten des Shoppingbereichs des Venetian. Hier werden sowohl verschiedene Pastas wie auch Pizzas serviert zusammen mit einer überraschend grossen Weinkarte die es - für Las Vegas Verhältnisse - zu vernünftigen Preisen gibt. Zu den Vorspeisen werden leckere Parmesan Rolls serviert die die Wartezeit auf den Hauptgang verkürzen. Als Main Course gab es Tagliatelle an einer Rahmsauce die gut war, aber nicht mehr. Als Nachtisch wurde hausgemachtes Tiramisu im Glas serviert welches fünf Sterne verdient hätte. Alles in allem ein gutes Esserlebnis zu vernünftigem Preis."}
{"text":"Not so good!! Ho hum taste, forgettable foods!! There was absolutely nothing memorable of this place!!! Tried it and it failed big time!!"}
{"text":"Trattoria Reggiano is a must-go whenever I'm in vegas. I've been there a bunch of times, and it has never disappointed me. I think you can tell a lot about the skills of a chef by the taste of their most basic dish, and the spaghetti and the meatballs are out of this world, which tells me they know what they're doing! i've also tried the caprese which was amazing, the carbonara (to die for!), the aglio e olio YUM, and their veal milanese, which they graciously topped with a ton of prosciutto when we asked.   i'm the type of person who tries not to go to the same restaurant twice, but this place i will be visiting EVERY SINGLE TIME i'm in vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food at a reasonable price. Our waiter was a little sarcastic, but his so-so attitude was made up for by the quality of the food. Recommended for casual, affordable (relatively speaking) Italian on the strip."}
