{"text":"The place was fully booked and we didn't make reservations, so we sat at the full service bar. The bar tender Annahita, took wonderful care of us! Drinks were creative and paired well with the food, and holy crap the food! I recommend the tuna tataki as a small plate and the 49th state roll. By far some of the most creative and tasty sushi we've had in a while!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go if you're looking for a fun atmosphere with great food and drinks. I'm not a huge fan of sushi but the menu here gave me more than enough options! Service was great and the shows were engaging and so much fun!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing rolls and sashimi!! Huge variety of food from Sushi to Steak, and large selection of fantastic drinks!! Loved the Godzilla drink, YUMMY!!! You have to get the honey toast for dessert!!!! All the staff is awesome. Super fun place with great entertainment. Definitely a must go to!!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional experience. Fantastic space, great entertainment and beyond amazing sushi. We had a crew of six and had an outstanding time!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Food was great and atmosphere was so fun!! Much more affordable than a lot of strip restaurants. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Sushi is meh. It is so-so, do not get any tuna dishes Not as fresh compare to the other fish dishes. Unless it is somewhat cooked like starter,  Rok ceviche, that was surprisingly good.  Salmon is fresh and taste good. Some sashimi pieces are cooked, when they should be raw the mackerel for example. The cocktails are good, stong but with mixed perfectly,  their isn't a fight between alcohol and mixes; Sakura and Asking for Trouble.   The servers are good never pushed us get everything on the menu and always came by to make sure we were satisfied. The same can't be said about the host.  When we ate there the place was empty, too late for lunch to early for dinner, yet she wanted to put us right by a column. We weren't having it and she rolled her eyes and put us somewhere else. The host is everybody's first dinning experience especially if your 1st time.  The decor of the place was awesome, loved the painting on the wall, actually the wall.  Great graffiti work."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something fun and unique - this is the place. They have a DJ playing music. During dinner, the wait staff stops and puts on a show. It's super entertaining. We ordered the Pink Pagoda which is a fishbowl type drink. While the drink was really good, it did take over 20 minutes from when we ordered it to actually get it. For a $50 drink and a decent sized drink menu, you'd think they'd be on top of it.   Our food also took forever to come out. Our party of 3 ordered two starters and 3 sushi rolls. The crispy rice and the baked crab hand rolls were really good. The sushi rolls (volcano, el chapo and tiger) were good but I've had better sushi in Vegas. Our waiter Seth was so nice, always checking in throughout the night. I've given 4 stars because the food and drinks tasted good, it was entertaining and the manager did give us 30% off our drink because of how long it took. Recommend coming here before going out to start off a fun night!"}
{"text":"Good food. Small portions. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Once we got past the not so nice host stand, we had such a good time! The food was delicious, the staff and entertainment was so fun. Definitely do not forget the sake bomb!"}
{"text":"Don't know if this review is fair but I was at a work function and they had us upstairs and we only had appetizers. They quickly ran out of food and took them awhile to refill. Appetizers were average. I was disappointed. Maybe I need to give it another try."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my wife, my daughter, and her boyfriend.   The server was friendly and the food was quite good.   I had seared scallops with root vegetables.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and the vegetables were also prepared to perfection.   The best thing was the flavorful broth that held the veggies underneath the scallops.   I wished they had given me a spoon so that I could finish it off!  My wife had pork dumplings and a delicious roasted Brussel-sprout dish.  My daughter and her boyfriend had sushi, which looked delicious and apparently was.      In case you haven't heard, this restaurant has an informal floor show every so often, in which all the servers sing and dance.  It slows down the food delivery a bit, but it adds a fun touch to the experience."}
{"text":"Food was great, but a bit overpriced. You're paying for the show though. What we also got on the evening of 8/18 was a fire alarm that lasted between 10-15 minutes. It was extremely loud and shrill making the meal difficult to enjoy for my girlfriends birthday dinner. Even after the hostess apologized for the inconvenience, there was no apology or remediation attempt by management. The way the situation played out we would have thought that management would have at least offered to comp an appetizer or drinks, but alas, nothing. It was a little disappointing, not sure if we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ambience, people and sake are fabulous! Lovely wait staff, but food left something to be desired. Definitely not the best seaweed salad or peppers. All extremely highly salted to almost inedible. But it's a nice establishment and is one after a few sakes"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! Great entertainment, great staff and amazing food!!! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the atmosphere and the food was delicious. I thought the sushi was exceptional and very tasty. The place is a lot of fun and it has great energy! I would recommend it is a great place to stop and enjoy your meal and entertainment."}
{"text":"This place kicks ass! Great for families with teens - entertaining. Sushi really does \"rok\"."}
{"text":"Me and my family went to Sake Rok and had an amazing time! The entertainment was amazing, my server Daniel and Carlos were super sweet and helpful! They recommended good entrees and made the visit spectacular! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"An experience not to be missed! They've just opened and are trying a whole new concept filled MC's and dancing servers! My server Mitch was the absolute best! Very entertaining and not to mention the food is to DIE for!!!"}
{"text":"OMG, Sake Rok is AMAZING!! The staff was unbelievable, I would come back just to be entertained by them. Secondly, the food was friggin awesome!! Sushi was so fresh and had a nice flare to it. If that wasn't enough, the entertainment every 30 mins is so cool!! Definitely my new favorite and I will come here every time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Went for brunch to have some bottomless mimosas and try out the new brunch menu. The staff was amazing and never let our glasses get empty. The poke stack, Maine lobster Benedict, skirt steak and eggs, roasted chicken, omurice and ROK French toast ROCKED!! The MC, Simon, did a great job keeping us entertained and laughing! Awesome music was played, memories were made and I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great food we went at lunch. Good seaweed salad. Also sushi is great. I'd say gofer the Ent then stay for the food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is what Vegas is all about; great food and entertainment. I'd have to say that this was one of the best dining experiences that I've had. My husband and I ordered the tofu tempura, rock shrimp, wagu beef sliders, miso cod, O toro and hamachi sashimi, king crab California roll, and of course, the honey toast. Everything is a must! The fish is so fresh, the rock shrimp was just the right amount of spicy, the miso cod was melt in your mouth, and the honey toast was so tasty and convenient to eat (they cut it up in little croutons).   Now, that was only the food. On to the staff, they are your entertainment. They are not only efficient and friendly servers, but great dancers. I was so pumped up once I left Sake Rok! What a great experience."}
{"text":"The food is amazing... tiger roll,  puff dragon and el chapo rolls.  Dragon fly And Godzilla drinks are great and the entertainment is awesome! Don't miss out on a memorable experience by coming here! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Trendy atmosphere, delicious spicy edamame, coconut rice and sushi! EVERYONE was friendly...great service! Ask for Ben :)"}
{"text":"Monday, April 17, 2017.  We had the best experience at Sake Rok with Benjamin, our excellent food server who volunteered some recommendations on the menu that were fabulous. We were so grateful for his help. Along with Sushi try the Shishito Peppers and separately the mushroom plate.  Add a bowl of rice and you'll be in food heaven. Highly recommend this restaurant.  Hope Benjamin is your food server. He's also one of the dancers.   Livia A"}
{"text":"The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the decor is fun. Make sure to order the crispy brussels sprouts, they were amazing! My only minor critique is that the entertainment comes off a bit desperate when the restaurant isn't busy. I'm sure that it's fun when the place is packed but with only ~ 10 customers, it was kind of sad. Maybe start the entertainment a few hours later so that there are more people to participate?"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place is expensive. With that in mind, it's best to come here for a small meal. The food itself is very good & the restaurant has a club feel, live DJ & performances every hour. It's a fun place to go in a group, but the music does get very loud so probably not the best place for an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Oh my god, this place was amazing. They told us it was their first week open so that explained the hiccups in service here and there (one of our drinks were forgotten but when we reminded them, they got it fast; we got something that we didn't order but ate it anyway - sorry other table, your salt & pepper shrimp was delicious!) but overall we had an it didn't really matter. We've never seen anything like this. The atmosphere is like a big party, the servers would break into a Vogue dance and boyband lip syncs out of nowhere but not in a kitschy way. It was pretty much my dream come true. Most surprising to us was the food. We had a mushroom dish the waitress suggested (can't remember the name) and everyone at our table loved it - even though half don't even eat mushrooms. Half our group went to Nobu, we came here and I can honestly say the quality of the sushi and hot food was comparable. No exaggeration. The Girl on the Beach, El Chopo, the scallops. Yum, yum, yum. I'm sure there were more because everything surprised us. I almost forgot....the best part was the MC. He was hysterical and we couldn't take our eyes off him- a real character. We stayed until 2am. Not our normal thing to do! Going back next time in Vegas and will update about service. Sake Rok, sake bomb!"}
{"text":"No wait because the place was mostly empty. Each persons order was brought out separately over a period of 20 minutes so forget about eating together. The steak was a gelatinous blob, the tempera shrimp were small and greasy, the sushi was good, the honey toast was the worst I've ever had, or seen. At first the honey toast looked fine,  then they insisted on cutting the four corners and making it looked like someone stepped on the dish! The show is very short and silly.  Waste of time and money. This is 'Vegas, you can do much better."}
{"text":"Awesome date night!! We had several appetizers and small plates. Recommend the crispy shrimp with truffle aioli! Their twist on Honey Toast is a pleasant surprise!! We will be back! Thanks to the great  and entertaining service staff and the General Manager, Todd."}
{"text":"We follow the open hour on Yelp and Google maps. It took us half an hour walk to get there only to find it is closed. Really? This restaurant is so lame by not updating the business hour."}
{"text":"I would give this place a negative if I could. Rich our server was the worst I could ever imagine. After multiple forgotten orders I laughed at one of his comments which was followed up by \"laugh again\" from which.  Which I followed up by \"why\" rich replied \" I get off at 11\". After taking this up with the management the manager said he will check on us to make sure everything is OK. Which he never did. There were 4 extra shots charged on our $800 bill. Never go here unless you want to be treated rude and charged extra for it. The food was decent at best. Good luck if  you decide to go here."}
{"text":"Wow!  What an awesome place. My old ass wasn't expecting such a cool experience.  Food is just part of what this place offers.  Within 5 minutes of us sitting down, I realized this isn't going to be a \"normal\" sushi restaurant.  It was basically a show with awesome services and great food.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place was so fun! Perfect for fun dinner/drinks before going out. The food was very good and the sushi was unique but the food is definitely over priced here. But we thought it was worth it for the atmosphere and uniqueness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi rolls, food was decent. However, when we were done we left and went to shake shack for more food because we were still hungry. $100 bill and we didn't feel to full.   If you're looking for entertainment and to get out this may be your place. If you're looking for a quiet sushi place this is not your spot."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but the tiny portions seemed overpriced. The atmosphere was fun and lively with some entertainment, but definitely not a quiet romantic venue. I've never been to a sushi restaurant where nigiri sushi was just one piece, so I ordered some thinking I was getting two for $5-$10 but instead it was literally just one tiny slice of fish for that price. I also ordered the sashimi tacos which turned out to be bite sized. Overall, the food was delicious, the portions just didn't equate to the price."}
{"text":"This was a blast. Even though it was just my wife and I, it was still fun. This place is great for groups. It was hilarious! Plus the food was great."}
{"text":"Amaze balls. You should probably go here when in Vegas. Amanda was awesome. You should also have her serve you. It's best if you do saki bombs. You will surely not regret it.  I highly recommend having some sort of occasion when you come here. It's going to make your experience so much more fun. Even if you don't have a special occasion you will have a blast here."}
{"text":"It is safe to say that after eating at Sake Rok it has now ruined all of my local sushi spots I go to in Las Vegas. The food is nothing but delicious! From the amazing art all around the restaurant, the fresh cuts of assorted sashimis' to this 42oz tomahawk steak we shared, Sake Rok is my favorite place to go in Las Vegas! They have a live DJ and a emcee that keeps the energy going throughout the entire evening, as well as all these crazy sake bomb races between tables. While we were enjoying our meal the entire staff broke out in this dance off battle between Backstreet boys vs Nysc that have the entire restaurant involved.   The experience overall at Sake Rok is amazing! Located right next to the T-Mobile Arena at The Park this place is perfect to go to before and after a concert, NHL game or even just a random week night out."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. High prices. If you value your hearing, skip this place.  Noise was deafening.  Do not get the appetizer of salmon with beer.  The beer killed the delicate flavor of the raw salmon.  Grilled brussel sprouts... phew... they were sweet.  The waitress was nice.  If you are over 35, this place is probably not for you."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  The ambiance, the service, the vibes and of course the food!  My favorite is the shrimp appetizer dish.  This is always my go to for a fun, girl's night out dinner."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great combination of a fun atmosphere and amazing food. Sierra at the bar took great care of me and made spot on food recommendations (of course it's possible the entire menu is good). They have a DJ, singer and dancers performing around the restaurant which added to the fun. If you are looking for a fun place to go with amazing food, this would be a great choice."}
{"text":"Decent prices for being in the now over-priced Vegas. Staff is fun and very entertaining during their performances. Service is on point and the food is excellent! Heads up that you will have to park in a nearby garage which will cost you about $7 for the first 4 hours in the area. This is just about what to expect anywhere in Vegas these days."}
{"text":"This place ruined our bachelor party weekend.  The unprofessional waiter recommended some sake to the table \" that just came in\" and  opened the bottle without stating the price.  Then we received a bill for $3,000 for 8 people.The sake was $1400..!!!!!!!!!!!.  Now if you do some searching for Murasaki Sake, it doesn't exist.  Being in the restaurant business for 10 years, I believe that these guys make and bottle some sake that you can't do research on, charge an obscene about of money thinking that their clients will eat feces and pay the bill because they are too embarrassed to complain, and then shove it up your private region just because they think they can.  Please note a bottle of top rated Isojiman Junmai Ginj? is about 115$.  When the staff was confronted, they lied and said it's standard practice to mention the pricing. Now mind you, there were 5 business owners sitting at the table that spend an a ton of money that weekend without incident.   Would you ever spend $1400 on 2 bottles of sake worth 100$?  I thought not.  Then we spoke with the smug owner Todd, the type of guy who makes it a practice to sodomize his customers on over priced sushi, 200$ steaks, and $700 bottles of sake.  He sodomizes you without regret and actually enjoys your pain. Do yourself a favor, go to a real sushi restaurant with professional staff and stay away from  tourist traps like this because there is always a wolf waiting.  Some restaurants don't understand the value that clients like us bring, clients that have no problem spending a lot of money, but instead see it as an opportunity to defraud you and leave a terrible taste in your mouth, long after the after taste of their sushi is gone."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome... really amazing sushi , loved the salt and pepper shrimp. Very friendly staff. Fun vibe. Right by the new arena highly recommend this place prices very reasonable for the strip especially considering the quality of the food and experience"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Vegas!  The food is fabulous, and Jonnis & company keep you entertained from the moment you walk in the door and make you sorry that you have to leave when it's time to go home.  It's like a party you don't want to end.  I first stumbled across the restaurant when in town for a concert at T-Mobile and wanted to get a quick bite before the show. I almost wanted to skip the concert and stay at Sake Rok. A month later we were back in town and had to share this place with the people we were traveling with. I've told everyone I know that this is a must do when in town!!  The sushi was prepared perfectly and presented with flair. Edamame was hot, just salty enough and served immediately. The staff is professional, fun and talented.  Great location in The Park and a wonderful new vibe for Vegas. My only complaint is they aren't open late night as this would be a place where you could hang out with friends long past 10pm.  Thanks for making Vegas fun again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! The sautéed peppers, tempura shrimp, and marinated mushroom dish were all fantastic! Great quality fish in sushi rolls. Best restaurant in the area. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was very good. A little loud for old people like us. Definitely geared towards a younger crowd."}
{"text":"I have visited Sake Rok twice and its great! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for good sushi and an overall fun experience. They are a vibe dining restaurant and there is always something going on. From the DJ to the performances, there is never a dull moment.  Fave dishes include the shishito peppers, sweet potato appetizer and the specialty rolls.  Their new dessert (Honey Toast) is ridiculously good and perfect to share with a large groups. The service is also on point."}
{"text":"5 stars for their Sushi and staff!  Awesome assistance/recommendations on sushi rolls.  Cannot comment about their Ramen or Steakhouse items but the Sushi is some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I went with bartender recommendations and was not disappointed. Crispy roll is an absolute must have for anyone who enjoys a little spice. Matches perfect with Lily Pad Martini. Tiger roll was pretty good as well, but assuming there is a better roll on menu for the $19 price tag. Highly recommended spot - high energy, great food."}
{"text":"Good service but the portions are small for the money. could be because your on the strip and everything is overpriced. As far as quality goes its average."}
{"text":"Amazing food and such a fun atmosphere! We came here for a birthday party. Every single food item was so delicious. Especially the coconut rice! So much fun with the live DJ and entertainment."}
{"text":"Great food and entertainment! The hand crab rolls, kamikaze and volcano rolls were amazing!"}
{"text":"What a fun environment! Live entertainment, ridiculously good food and great service. A can't miss experience!"}
{"text":"The Girl on the Beach roll and the Puff the Magic Dragon roll are both great, but if you're ordering something cooked, expect to wait a LONG time. The grilled cauliflower is cooked and good.  Food also comes out as it is made, not all at once, so you and your table mates may not get your food at the same time. But the food is great tasting.  The waitress, Danielle, was very knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful. She answered lots of questions for us, even walking us through how to properly drink a sake bomb.  Note: Not a gluten free place to eat. Very little on the menu is gluten free."}
{"text":"The entertainment was good and fun. The food was mediocre. Sushi was ok. Apps were good. We enjoyed the furtikake fries and rok edamame. HOWEVER our service the WORST I have ever had! DJ was our server. Granted we had a party of 16. 6 of us were going to share a check. It took OVER 30 minutes to get there 8 sake person special. OVER 30 minutes to get second order or fries. We also did a first round of sake first which was HOT and then our second round was COLD. He NEVER apologize or owned up for the wait more his lack to remember we had hot sake. AGAIN the WORST service I had EVER had and I would never come back for that reason NOR recommended this to ANYONe bc the entertainment could not out way  the HORRIBLE service."}
{"text":"Came here before going to see The Killers concert the other night. The atmosphere is fun, very loud so don't plan on being able to hold a conversation (I love the vibe if the music could be turned down a slight notch) and if you are shy, beware they pull people from the crowd to interact during their dance/singing routines.   We had reservations at 8pm and were seated right away but ignored, literally with no one even bothering to say two words to us even though we were passed by multiple people multiple times due to setting up other tables for large parties. If we had to wait, even though there were empty tables, I would have rather waited in the lobby than be ignored and passed by over and over and over without one word.   I finally ordered a drink that took 10 more minutes to arrive and when it did, it was a substitute since the restaurant was out of the ingredients of the cocktail I had originally ordered. Luckily, I was flexible since I just wanted anything to dull the experience thus far.   Food came sporadically but was overall good. Pork belly was overlooked.   I work for MGM Resorts and definitely take customer service seriously, it is the hallmark of our industry. I doubt I'll be back and if I do make it back, it will be months to see if the rookie mistakes have a chance to be corrected."}
{"text":"Great entertainment!! Great service and food is bomb! Def check out this spot! Thank you Todd for everything!"}
{"text":"All the staff is super friendly. We only saw our server 3 times the entire night because he was so busy busting a move with all the other servers. We put in a small order with him in the beginning wanting to order more later but wound up having to order through the busser. He got the order wrong and we wound up with a different roll than we wanted but it just seemed pointless to try and get it fixed since our server was still dancing or MIA. Also, it's really loud so be bring your outside voice if you want to have a conversation.  -Yellowtail - Good..oh so tiny tho -Rok and Roll - What we got instead of what we wanted. Just chopped up fish on a slice of cucumber. 0 flavor. -Miso Black Cod - Delicious (per my friend) it's his favorite thing to get and I agree. -Beef Tataki - Good, like others I've had -Pork Dumplings - Amazing -Tuna Taco - Chopped up tuna in a taro \"taco\" chip. It wasn't seasoned at all. Wanted wasabi and ginger but the server was gettin down with N'Snyc and Backstreet Boys so we just ate it.  It's an interesting concept and I really enjoyed the energy especially of our own server when I saw him out there but it seems like they focus more on choreography than the food service  I think it's worth a trip at least once to experience but I'm not going to pay for parking to go there again."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was the worst I have ever experienced! It took over 20 minutes to have someone even come to our table to take our drink menu. Once the \"server\" took our order, we realized she was only a runner ( yet did not tell us nor grab our server for us) and had to wait another 10 minutes for the actual server. The wrong food was delivered to our table on FOUR separate occasions with one time the runner telling us it was our edamame( again, we hadnt even been greeted at this point). There seemed to be at least 3 managers working the room, yet not one ever approached our table of 9 to see how we were doing. Some of our food came out within a reasonable amount of time, while others were served their food well after the group had already finished. We were celebrating a birthday yet the hostess never seemed to mention it to anyone so our birthday girl was ignored. Poor service all around. We will not be returning next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just ate at Sake Rok. One word - Amazing!!  The food was delish and the show was so much fun. Jonath is a great performer. Started with the shishito pepper appetizer then had tempura veggies and salt and pepper shrimp. Plus a fancy cocktail. Dinner and a show for  $54?  Incredible!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Your better of going to a show for the price of the dinner. Food was a disappointment. Entertainment is ok. Overpriced overall. I rarely give reviews but this place is a joke."}
{"text":"Had great expectations for this place. An all you can eat menu for $25!! Wow!! However, there's fine print. We didn't see that until after we sat down. We came in after 1pm on a Saturday. The place was virtually empty except for 4, maybe 5 tables. We were asked to wait another 15 minutes so they could set up our table and also because the host didn't want to overwhelm the one and only waitress working. Ok. We get it. No problem. Had a beer at the outside bar. When we finally got seated and looked over the menu, all you can eat menu only covers the appetizers, $5 basic sushi-1 piece only and the basic hand/cut rolls (no specialty rolls). When you order, you can only order 3 items at a time. Not sure if they were having a big party that evening but our first orders didn't come out of the kitchen for 20 min!! How long does it take to prepare 5 appetizers and 2 pieces of sushi (times 6 people)?? We asked to put in our next order since the wait was long and were told by our waitress that we must finish eating our first round of food before we can order again. Granted the fine print also says there is a 1 hour time limit.  As frustrating as this was, everyone was very nice. Food was delivered with a smile and the food tasted great.  Still cant understand why the food took so long to come out. Even waited 15 minutes for mochi.  The whole time we were in the restaurant (about 90 min) there were no more than 3 or 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant.  Wont be back again, even though the food was great."}
{"text":"Very fun tourist, sushi experience. Sushi was very good but overpriced. But, at this location it's mainly the atmosphere and the entertainment. The host had a Mic and takes sake bombs with the patrons, he tells jokes, and they do dance routines. Music was lively and service was attentive, but it could be based on being half full or because it was under an hour to closing. Based on price, I'd go elsewhere but I'd bring first-timers for a rock and roll sushi experience."}
{"text":"SO interesting.  Actually, our group went into the dining experience knowing this was not the norm.  We read reviews.  That's why I'm leaving one.  We dined here before the Rolling Stones.  They sat us upstairs.  It was SO incredibly dark.  Not quaint, romantic or even swanky.  Just dark.  Hard to read the menus, no candles... only the flash lights on our phones to help.  That was the first bummer.  Our server who greeted us (Jen?) didn't reappear until the end of our dining experience.  There seemed to be a lot going on with the staff... lots of whispering, in and out of the kitchen/back room.  Just strange.  We had piles of food and nothing stood out for me.  Dinner and a little show.  Try it, you can be the judge.  I did and will probably not return."}
{"text":"I was in town for the week attending a dental workshop and found out about Sake Rok through Yelp! I decided to check out Sake Rok as my last stop before heading to the airport. I came in around 530PM and was greeted by a nice hostess that sat me write in the action of this place.   I sat down right before they started one of their shows which seemed to be a \"boy-band battle\" The energy in the room was contagious! I could see everyone's faces light up as we were entertained by the music from the live DJ and then the show!  I have been to quite a few restaurants in Las Vegas but haven't seen a venue that is this unique. It feels like it belongs in Tokyo, San Francisco or New York. There was cool street art all over the place and there was a giant video wall that went with the shows. Little details everywhere that you typically don't see anymore  I am a sushi snob and can be hard to please at times, but the food came out fast and was delicious! You could taste the quality in each item! The Omakase Platter was my favorite item on the menu. I also ordered the El Chapo roll and loved the tomatillo sauce! We decided to get the Tomahawk Steak as well and with the Truffle butter on top it was simply amazing. They brought it out on this cool Godzilla platter that came with a cool presentation. To finish dinner we ordered the Honey Toast, and it was LIFE CHANGING!  Service was great and my server kept up with my drinks. They had great recommendations and really created an amazing experience. Excited to visit again on my next workshop trip to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"We came to see what this place was all about tonight......... Being Vegas locals, we have seen a lot and aren't surprised by much. With that said, we were very entertained by the \"Dancing Staff\". Dancers were great and the two Singing Hosts (MC's) made you feel like part of the cast. I have to have to give it to the Geisha Female ( MC) singer, I believe her name is Lily.... she made her rounds and joined every group, but to top it off..... this girl can SING ( better than anyone on the Strip)!!!! Thank you for making our \"Monthly Night Out\"!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this review a five star because my server was five star all the way! Jatae was a lot of fun and kept me happy. For it good as well. Fun experience. Great location right outside T-Mobile arena."}
{"text":"Well deserving 5 star spot next to T-Mobile Arena. Exceptional Food and wonderful service. If you want sushi, Japanese Beers and Sake, this is the place. It takes a lot from an establishment for me to do a review, as I only do 5 stars. In closing, Sake Rok rocks!"}
{"text":"This place is all fluff and no substance.  The fish is mediocre and the service is awful. But if you are just there for the crowd and dj then I guess you'll like it.  I go to restaurants for quality food, not pomp and circumstance.  This was some young dumb shit."}
{"text":"This is the best sake house I have ever been to!!! The food is great and the staff is even better. We had three punch bowls and they were great, the boys at our table have three 60 oz sake bombs and they loved them. 100% would recommend to friends. The staff breaks out in song and it's such a great time. All the songs all throwbacks, I will be back."}
{"text":"Definitely not a cheap place! Low value. Entertainment was not all that... Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Sake rok was very entertaining and has the best service. Rok shrimp tempura was great !"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend.  There is definitely a high energy ambience with the music playing and dj there, plus once about every 30 to 45 minutes the crew breaks out into a very well choreographed dance. The service was very attentive (and our server was very sweet!) and the food was really good.  We shared their spicy miso soup as a starter and it was delicious, my boyfriend got the spicy samurai roll and thought it was good,but I had the miso black cod and it was probably the best fish I've ever had! This place was a lot of fun with good food and we'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Very fresh. Good but should be $$$$ Didn't expect to pay$19 for only 4 pieces of nigiri sushi and $15 for one piece of toro. Plus tax and a tip, $40 for 5 small sushi!"}
{"text":"I would've loved to try the smoked salmon sashimi & crispy rice, but unfortunately no waiter came to our table. This was AFTER they made us finish our Fat Tuesday cups before entering. We ended up leaving after a few sips of water. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!  Sooo freaken delicious!! We got the spicy samurai roll and the volcano roll and they were amazing! Probably the best sushi I've had!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some dinner and drinks off the strip. There was a live entertainment show for a bit. If you're looking for a quiet place then this is not it. Ended up coming back in the day with kids, and then enjoyed it too."}
{"text":"Fun vibe and cool design. Definitely recommend ordering the El Chapo Roll and if you're with a big group, get the smoking Godzilla Platter!!"}
{"text":"I must admit the vibe here is pretty nice. I'm sure it'll be a good place to drink out with friends and enjoy a delicious Japanese meal. I gave a 3 star because the service was pretty slow, considering we came in around 5:00 pm and there were only a few tables:  1). First off, It took a while for our hot tea and water to get there until we reminded them (apparently there were chatting among themselves near the bar). 2). We were given our check when we haven't even asked for it and while we were still waiting for our Black Cod dish to arrive. We told him the order was in the bill but hasn't come out yet. he did say sorry but wasn't very attentive all in all.  Other than that, their food was pretty good and fresh. We had a light meal and what's worth mentioning was uni sashimi (considering the price they charge), and Miso Black Cod dish was excellent. We also ordered Wagyu but I've had better."}
{"text":"This place isn't for me, but it's a great spot on the strip for anyone visiting the T-Mobile Arena to come and have a great time before (or after) a show.   They are a bit gimmicky for my taste.  We went before the Garth Brooks concert and the waitstaff was all dressed in \"country\" attire and the specials were all huge steaks. I suppose they were catering to the T-Mobile Arena audience, but the character of the place got lost a bit in all of that for me. What I didn't realize until later, was that the party/fun element is part of what they do.   I loved the entrance with the huge sake barrels--the whole place has a minimalist, urban, industrial thing going on. Who doesn't these days? But after you are seated they bring you these huge menus that are a great conversation piece. But a hassle for reading and selecting.   The group ordered a ton of food, but I only tasted the roasted cauliflower, the miso soup, and the sashimi.  This is NOT the type of place to come expecting  high quality fish--I don't care what the waitress says.  I knew it when we picked this place and I'm glad my expectations were low. There is better quality fish to be had in most other sushi places in this valley. But those in our party with cooked dishes seemed to really enjoy them.   There was this simmering party atmosphere because at a designated time, the waiters were all prepared break into song and dance. People were dancing around a bit in anticipation of their performances and a lively emcee was serving sake bombs to various tables.   Sake bombs are definitely a thing here. You will be made aware of each one that is consumed.  We left before the festivities began, but I can see people either loving or hating that element of the vibe. If you're not into it, arrive early. The \"show\" starts at 7:00.   In all, tourists will like it.   I actually appreciate what they are doing at Sake Rok--I'm all about an entertaining meal and a bit of spectacle. This is Vegas, right? But, for me, the food just didn't offer enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Not your typical sushi restaurant!  Great sushi, fun atmosphere!!  Sort of like dinner and a show!!!  Try the volcano roll !!!"}
{"text":"Sake Rok is the perfect place if you're looking for dinner and entertainment! The food is amaaaaaaazing AND their service is impeccable! I loved it here and I will definitely come back!!  Jatae was our server and she was beyond great"}
{"text":"If you like service, this ain't the place for you. Food is okay at best and team is obviously disorganized. They brought my appetizer and I sat there for 15 minutes. Then, they bring my check. I asked about my entree and I get a confused stared. 10 more minutes, food arrives with an apology. I finish the meal and I sit another 20 minutes without seeing a server. I should have kept the check the first time it was delivered."}
{"text":"I can't understand the 4 star ratings for this restaurant. We had late lunch reservations (130pm) and while the restaurant was not busy maybe 10 tables when we got there and 2 by the time we left, the service was slow and sushi mediocre. 5 in our group ordered the $35 all you can eat and with a limit of 3 things at a time and with an hour time limit. The nigiri sushi took at least 15-20 minutes PER order and the rice for the nigiri kept getting bigger and bigger! Ramen took 30 minuets and we had to inquire about it 3 separate times. We inquired about their signature honey toast and ordered the loaf but was served a single serving honey toast dessert. When we questioned it, the employee that brought out the single serving said \"that waitress usually doesn't work when that's served\". Not even an offer to correct the order. Coming all the way from Hawaii, what a disappointment."}
{"text":"Sorry, better off at Makino Japanese buffet for what you pay for. Everything is over priced and the quality food is not great. Got the $25 buffet. If you'd been to good Japanese restaurants, you will not be pleased with Sake Rok, overpriced, quality of sushi rice is not good. For pork dumplings they charge $10 and they came out warm and were super tiny, looks like the frozen pork dumplings you in bags. Please if your going to spend $25+ go to a buffet better. Miso soup is packets one and is watered down with only 3 pieces of real tofu. The only good thing is the service there is awesome and the mochi ice cream. That's all."}
{"text":"Two words .....bad ass. I thought I hated sushi until  sake rok! Been here twice in last 3 days and I just made reservations for tomorrow"}
{"text":"This place was great. Good food, great mix of Items. The entertainment is great. Perfect place to start a night out or stay all night"}
{"text":"My hubby and I were walk-ins here last night before heading to a concert. It was our first time and we found out it's a reservation type of place. Hostess asked if we could be done by 6:15 since they were totally booked for the night (it was 4:45 & we were a party of 2). We agreed and they sat us. After ordering drinks, the hostess asked to move us to another table and provided free sake bombs for the move. We would have moved either way but a very nice offer.  The atmosphere was very fun and had a ready to party feel about it. I bet if we went later in the evening we would have loved that about this place.  The food was on par with a regular sushi restaurant.  (REMEMBER that this location is on the LV strip so prices are almost doubled from a regular sushi place. You really are paying for location.) I tried the miso soup (5 stars), king crab California roll (3 stars / pretty average) and nigiri yellowtail (5 stars) and tuna (3stars/ too fatty). My husband, loved the shishito peppers (warning: seeds galore. Yes I know peppers have seeds but these peppers have A LOT of seeds). He also had a kamikaze roll (5 stars). They also had the freshest ginger I have had in the longest time for a sushi restaurant!  Service was decent. It was early opening for dinner, they were getting things organized and we were given 3 different servers in the hour we were there. All 3 of the servers were pleasant and helpful. But with so many changes in a short period, usually results in mistakes. The requirement for our seating was to be finished at a certain time, hard to do when it takes 15 minutes just to get water and our beers. The 2nd server introduced himself but didn't offer to take our food order, weird. Our first server came back around and gave us our free sake bombs, (that was a fun experience) and then took our food order (30 minutes after seating) My husband ordered a second beer when we received our food, which first was served to the table next to us, and came at the end of our meal. Then about 5 minutes later the bartender brought a 3rd beer that he didn't order. We sent it back because we were finished. A minute later he brought it back saying it was on the house. It wasn't! We were charged for it. For $12 a beer my husband ended up drinking it! We didn't want to wait for someone to come back around, change the check and wait awhile to see one of those 3 servers again.  All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience. The food was about 4 stars, which is what matters most, service 3 stars (I'm chalking it up to opening time) and atmosphere was definitely 5 stars)."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot before Golden Knights games. Excellent food and a great variety. The staff is second to none. The pork belly is to die for, melts in your mouth. Huge tv to watch sports. They even beam it out to the patio. Everything here is outstanding."}
{"text":"Sushi was overpriced for what it was. There was four of us and we ordered a $200 platter and asked if it would be enough and they assured us it would be. We also ordered a seafood appetizer platter and told we would each get a piece yet it came with 3 pieces each and  ( 2 oysters) when we questioned why we were told they ran out of oysters but never bothered to let us know or even bothered to substituted so we all had to try and share. My cocktail was horrible it tasted like a margarita with olive oil. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because this place is quite entertaining. I Would only come back for sake and beer. I left super hungry even after spending so much money on sushi and appetizers. But it's Vegas so I can't complain much."}
{"text":"Went to Sake Rok with husband and 2 children (ages 8 and 10)....possibly not the best choice.  Very loud, party atmosphere which is great for bachelor parties etc. but don't expect the greatest dining experience here.  Could hardly see food as it was so dark and it was quite expensive.  Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Ummm.... food definitely mediocre.  Nothing special. Plenty of places to go other for \"sushi\"  or Japanese cuisine.  Soho, Other Mama, Sushi Tower, I Love Sushi...etc.  sheesh... $18+  rolls.  Not worth it.  Great Location... good service... fun times...ambiance.. I guess; however, don't go here if your a foodie.  You'll be disappointed. BTW they have the cotton cheesecake on menu which they haven't carried in a year."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow the night that we went but when our food was brought it was delicious. Wait staff was nice cared about us."}
{"text":"I would highly advise making a reservation. We stumbled across it, and it looked pretty empty when we arrived but the 4 hostesses at the entrance let us know it would be a 30 minute wait for 2 people. Luckily there is a bar outside to order a drink while you wait. There were people with the same size party and no reservation that got seated before us, so it wasn't off to a great start. Honestly, it did start to fill up quickly as the night went by. I could be wrong and maybe all the other empty tables were all reserved. But the hostesses could have been a little more inviting when we told them we didn't have a reservation.  However, as soon as we got to our table it was nothing but amazing! The wait staff came by every 10 minutes to see if we needed anything. It wasn't just waiting on one server to come around, it was a team effort with everyone working the tables and making sure everyone was taken care of. They were helpful, upbeat, and attentive. Even in between performing. I loved the vibe so much.  There was a DJ and an MC who went through all the tables to make sure everyone was having fun. It was definitely entertaining with everyone breaking out in dance and singing. It happened to be my friends birthday the next day, she was so happy that we came across this!  I've had a lot of great sushi, my standards are a little high. The food was ok, but good enough to where I'm still looking forward to revisiting next time I'm in Vegas. And they had some awesome drink choices.   Despite the drawbacks, this place deserves 5 stars in my book. Looking forward to my next trip there!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of friends and it was so fun and lively there. They have delicious things on the menu that I haven't seen anywhere else and their drink menu was the same way. Its an entire experience. The sake bombs and honey toast are a must."}
{"text":"Great food AND a great vibe here! My favorites were the Roasted Chicken, Poke Stack, & the stuffed French Toast, though every dish I tasted was delicious! I shared quite a few with friends for brunch. Highly recommend! Endless mimosas are totally worth it!!! DO IT!!!   *Simon* was a great MC! He brings such warmth and fun to the place. He and the other employees sing, dance, and generally entertain the entire time. But not in an overpowering way. Love it here! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I have to say I wasn't expecting to have as much fun as I did going here - but everything about this place exceeded expectations! The food was well flavored, the sashimi super fresh & the honey toast is a must order. The cocktails were fun - but the best part was the staff.   Nick the MC was so nice & really had a lot of fun making sure to work the room & shout out to Roark our waiter who knew how to bust a move!"}
{"text":"I haven't written a review in awhile. I found this receipt in my wallet from February 26,2017. Hoard much?! lol. It's a little hard to read, I think Jalae was our server. Todd, an old friend of mine set my girlfriend and I up for a gno dinner. Best spontaneous decision ever! Everything that came out was delicious especially the yummy sangria. Aside from great food and service there was a ton of entertainment.  It was an unexpected experience lots of singing, dancing, belly laughs & fun times. I will definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Maybe they were having an off night...but I wasn't super wowed. The performances were pretty fun, but the service could use some fine tuning. When the sushi came we did not have soy sauce nor the little plates for soy sauce. They forgot my friend's miso soup and the server was not very attentive. The sushi rolls were pretty good. The cauliflower entree was not very intuitive to eat with chopsticks--basically half a cauliflower. They were very cool with my friend's niece who just turned 21. If I come back to Vegas and crave sushi, I will probably go back to Koi."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved dining at Sake Rok! The food was so delicious, and all of the employees were incredibly kind and pleasant. However, they seemed a bit unorganized at times, as multiple different servers were trying to help us, and it took quite a while for the food to come out. I chalked this up to the fact that the restaurant is very new, and maybe all of the kinks aren't quite worked out yet. Overall, it was a great experience with excellent food, and we had a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Not only was the food great but their service was amazing.  Exactly what you would want going to a restaurant in Las Vegas, I didn't expect to have so much fun thinking we'd just have dinner and leave but the atmosphere was so good and Dj was playing great music we decided to just stay there until they closed:). Carlos & Rork our server were both amazing and very attentive to our needs.  He was on top of it anytime we needed something.   Definitely recommend this place if you want to have some good food and have a good time"}
{"text":"Worst dinner last night! Terrible service and food! We've been several times before a hockey game with a group of 8 people. First visit was good, but it's gone steadily downhill since. Food and drinks come out sporadically. Nothing comes out together. Two people at our table got their entrees 20 mins after the first one came out, and the very last thing to arrive? Rice. Are you serious? You couldn't scoop the rice into a bowl for 30 minutes?! SLOW slow and slower. Friends steak was served rare. She asked our server if she could please cook it more, as she ordered it cooked medium? Server replied, So do you want it WELL DONE? Um, no. I'd like it cooked medium. Manager came to apologize. Manager had to come over to apologize last time we were there too. Last visit it was just two of us at the sushi bar and two items we ordered never did come and it was time to go to the game. They were sorry. Yep, you sure are. Yawn. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Meets and exceeds all expectations! Most highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced.  Tiny pieces, loud country music, and crappy service.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful venue, fun staff, a sushi connoisseurs restaurant."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  We let our waiter pick it for us.  The emcee was incredibly entertaining and regular dance routines were fantastic.  We came as a party of 5 but spent the entire night there and 10 others joined us we had so much fun."}
{"text":"Pretentious as hell.  Kinda off putting.  Odd menus just for the sake of being different.  The food...  WOW!  I will return on my next visit to sin city."}
{"text":"Normally we have a plan and try to have our dining picked ahead of time when in Vegas... Both of our prior 2 nights we did just that and really enjoyed ourselves before shows and dancing.  Our last night we didn't have a plan and needed a spontaneous spot after an early show.  We wanted sushi and this was one of the closest.  We scored...  Our best dining experience of the weekend.  Fun, casual, interesting,  and oh so tasty!  The menu is literally HUGE,  but don't let that fool you on the quality of the sushi. Drinks were great as well, the table favorite was like a spicy margarita, but with a Japanese flare.  Great Rock music the whole time, some 80s reminiscent dance and music videos on the wall.  It was a great way to cap off another fun weekend in Vegas."}
{"text":"thee decor was great as well as thee entertainment . however being i am not a sushi indulger there was not much on the menu for me . then i spent over 50 bucks and still went home and ate after . so with that being said prolly wont make it back but if you are a sushi fan wont hurt to try once"}
{"text":"The service here started off slow. As soon as we walked in and there were empty tables they let us know it would be five minutes for no resin. We sat down, it took 30 minutes for them to take our order. They rarely checked on us.   We ordered one cocktail to split between my friend and I, but the waitress charged us for two. We kindly and calmly asked she take one off the bill as we only had one cocktail glass to prove it. She seemed intoxicated and extremely rude. We asked for the manager who then proceeded to be defensive instead of hearing us out as a manager should. I will never be coming here again.   Overpriced food and drinks. Drunk servers. Horrible management. Go somewhere else when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is truly the coolest sushi restaurant I've ever been! The food is perfect! The wall art is amazing and the host is entertaining!"}
{"text":"Just a dry run prior to opening but this place will Rok! Engaging,  high energy and great food!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most exciting and entertaining restaurants I ever been too. If you want to entertain family or clients in an upbeat and comedic sushi restaurant this is the place. The shishito peppers are prepared so good. The edamame they carry it in to two styles. The Regular and Rick house style which is garlicky and spicy at perfection. The fastest way to access the restaurant is from the New York self parking garage."}
{"text":"Another sushi spot on the strip. I don't know how some of these places make it but this newly opened sushi spot has created their own niche for sushi dining in sin city. If you are in the mood for a low key sushi spot where you can chat with the chefs or have an audible conversation at your table, then you better keep walking. Here you will find tons of entertainment. This Located in the Park, it is set in a perfect location outside of the new T-Mobile arena. We walked in about 10pm on Saturday night, closing time was posted at 10:30pm but I was told that they will stay open until the last person leaves.   At first, I wasn't 100% sold on it. It was extremely loud inside and they sat me right next to a large post that takes up a lot of space. It was like I was in trouble or something or they were trying to hide me from the place because of my looks. HAHA! Seriously, I would recommend they do something about that spot for patrons. It is not the most conducive place for eating or enjoying the overall experience of the restaurant. I guess I could have said something but I sucked it up and rolled with it. The service was a bit slow at first and it took a few minutes for our server to acknowledge us but it was probably because I was sitting behind a large post and they couldn't see my big head. I probably would have made this a 5-star spot but the post thing wasn't cool. After that the service was wonderful. The beer and cocktails kept coming.   We weren't too hungry but went with a few appetizers, agadashi tofu, shishito peppers, seaweed salad (delicious), mixed tempura (way overpriced for $18), and miso soup for the wifey. They do not have a lot of options for sushi/sashimi and be forewarned that the pieces are priced for 1 piece of sushi. One piece of uni is $8, etc. Not a big deal because it's Vegas where things are way overpriced and they know stupid people like me will pay for it. I had the sashimi platter (chef's choice, so not the best pieces but they were okay) for $40. It was decent. I would probably order again but I should have tried something different rather than the sushi since they have so many offerings. Overall, the food was good.   The entertainment is the main attraction here. The MC for the night goes around messing with people. Be careful because if you look shy you will most likely get called out. He will persuade you to dance and make a fool of yourself. Hey, it's Vegas so whatever happens there will stay there, so just let the inner fool out, you know it's hiding in there and has been dying to come out. There happened to be a Lakers/Warriors preseason game that just let out and the Laker girls came in to dine. Yeah! I'm a huge fan but my wife told me to leave them alone. The MC got them in on the action and a few of them danced on stage. It was cool.   Servers were nice and attentive (after they realized we were there). Food was good and drinks were great. We didn't order a huge meal or that many drinks and the bill was a little much, with tip it came out to $230. So if you are budget minded this is not your place. You are paying for the ambience and entertainment value. I probably won't try it again. FYI- the bathrooms are unisex. Have a great time and try it out. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Somehow they decided it was okay to automatically autograt drinks and then below that add a line that says Tip! The only reason I noticed was because my two vodka sodas managed to be $25.30 here! My friend ordered some sushi and rock shrimp dish which he said was pretty good and I ordered the Teriyaki chicken which lacked any type of excitement. It was boiled chicken with a basic teryaki sauce- knda laughable considering the price!  Not sure if I'd come here for the food as the entetainment and dancing by the staff made for a better experience."}
{"text":"We are locals and this will now be our go to spot to take people who are visiting! Food was awesome, service was the best (thank you DJ!) and the show was the perfect addition to a night out.   Also, I want to commend them for being so allergy friendly... We had four separate allergies at our table including gluten free and they went out of their way to make us feel welcome and accommodated. Thank you for being the bomb!"}
{"text":"We hosted a huge event here for 300 people and had pretty high expectations based on the reviews and other recommendations.  We were horribly disappointed. They gave each table tiny plates of food, which we all thought were appetizers.  People picked at it and tried not to take too much so that everyone would be able to eat some, only to find out that those were the entree and not the appetizers.  Not only were the portions tiny, the food was not good - especially given the price we paid.  When tables started to complain, they brought out a few more plates of food, only to tell us that they had cooked everything they had and wouldn't be able to feed us any more.  Needless to say, all 300 people were very unhappy and hungry. We ended up having to order pizzas. You would think that a restaurant venue would prepare themselves for a large group of people and have enough food on hand, but apparently quantity of food didn't cross their minds. They were aware of the menu we were choosing, and should have warned us if they had known ahead of time that it wouldn't be enough for THREE HUNDRED people.  The staff was unfriendly and had serious attitude, further frustrating our group. We tried to host an awards ceremony on the top floor which was even more horrifying than the meal (sounds impossible, but it's true). The space was small and dark and their sound system was HORRIBLE.  Their microphones were squealing and kept cutting out.  The owner, who was supposed to be in charge of the sound, was rude and dismissive and didn't seem to care that their system wasn't operating correctly. We had arrived an hour early to make sure that everything was set up, and they were nowhere to be found to solve the issue.   Sake Rok was a terrible choice and I would never recommend bringing a group of people here. This restaurant was a huge embarrassment."}
{"text":"When my friend and I walked into this place we weren't really sure what to expect. It was pretty loud and there was an entertaining emcee cheering people on while taking sake bombs. The service was great - we had Amanda S. She was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was amazing. I highly recommend the colorful roll and the tempura roll. Also - the dessert something called toast/honey/berries.  We came here on a Saturday in January. It was loud, but entertaining. Everyone was really friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"The staff was awesome, the ambiance was fun just not what we were looking for. Way over priced!!!! Tuna tataki was 17$ for 5 tiny pieces and wasn't that good. We got these mushrooms that was so salty and their signature roll was gross with this weird mousse. I honestly just hated the food. The only thing I liked about this place was the staff. But for the price, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"It was a nice experience. Bartender was very friendly and conversational. Mixed a good drink but it was more on the$$$ then the $$. I had the Peter Parker roll it was nice could of had more punch to the flavors and I had the shishito peppers different but good light flavor. The started their show which was fun if you are at the bar you will be In the center of their dance routine !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Wednesday evening. Got right in. The sushi is okay. I have had better. Pretty fun atmosphere though. They are very entertaining. They have a host on a microphone who goes around to the different tables and the entire staff will randomly break out in dance. Entertaining, but not my first choice for sushi."}
{"text":"Group events - think twice before booking!  This is the most unprofessional staff I have ever worked with for a group dinner.  They tried to throw in a lot of last minute changes to our contract and slip them by us hoping they would go unnoticed. We had agreed to final payment at the completion of the event and they bugged us throughout the event (in front of our guests) to get a credit card before it was over.  They even wanted us to interrupt the President and CEO of our company while they were handing out awards on stage to try and get the credit card.  I would never go to this venue again and I would not recommend it to anyone considering a group event. BUYER BEWARE - You will be sorry if you chose this for your event!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great albeit pricey ($17 to $20 for speciality rolls). They do have some more regularly priced rolls that are about the size (six pieces) that you'd expect from a regular california roll (those are about $7 to $10 dollars). The drinks are awesome. The party atmosphere in the evenings is so fun and sure to leave you grinning. The shows that they put on every once in a while are HILARIOUS. The servers are all sweet and charming. The MC is a blast and an absolute oddball.   The show stealer though is the dessert! The honey toast is PHENOMENAL. Unreal. It is so like the most amazing french toast you could ever dream. Sweet and crunchy but also moist.   Also, FYI this place stays open to about 11/12 PM on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. This Japanese restaurant is amazing and we just celebrated my mother's 80th birthday. I loved the food and the live performances from the servers...very Tokyo crazy fun. Clearly, they all had Dance Training or some sort of Triple Threat training from Juilliard. I love that they've made a lot of eighties come back music with Madonna and the host was incredibly fabulous ...dig those eyelashes! Sushi was excellent, Shrimp Tempura was delish, yummy brussel sprouts and I really loved the Tomahawk steak presented  with Godzilla. This is the best place for celebrations and wild sake bombs even though I didn't have any that night. I would love to come here again."}
{"text":"Had the best time ever it was like dinner and entertainment all in one.  Carlos was amazing he made  sure everything was perfect.  Next time I'm in Vegas this is again a must do."}
{"text":"Digging' this new area of the Strip. Servers were great. Food was good. Venue is fun and lively. I'm just not that into the tourist trap type of restaurant. If you are, then this is the best sushi spot in town."}
{"text":"Decent food, HORRIBLE service. There are so many great dining options in Vegas, don't waste your time on this place. The services is so awful and the staff is beyone unapologetic about it. It took nearly an hour to get our drinks and another hour to get our food, all of which came out seperately..one of the girls didn't get any of her food until after the rest of us were done eating(at least 35 minutes after the rest of the food came) and she ordered appitizers!   I've had better service at the hotel food courts."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went on a Sunday night--- it was dinner and a show. Mentioning we were on a time crunch the waitress was very attentive and fast! We had the shishido peppers appetizer and a volcano roll. Oh my goodness this food is to die for. Must if you love sushi or even mildly like it.  I personally am not a fan of unisex bathrooms because of safety but there's that."}
{"text":"If you want some good sushi in a great environment then this is the place for you!! Food is outta this works and the servers dancing and singing makes it that much better! Shout to Angel and his partner for taking great care of us!! Definitely be back next time in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what we were getting into when u went here but it was amazing. First the sushi was terrific and then there was a show host and the waiters were dancing. It was very memorable . sake roc sake bomb !"}
{"text":"The Honey Toast was AMAZING!! By far the best I've ever had. We had the tempura, volcano, and tiger roll which were all to die for! The waiter was so nice, and the ambiance was great. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"So so so fun!!!! This place was so full of energy and interactive! The wait staff were super friendly. They all do performances between taking orders/bringing  food. The performances happen every 15 minutes or so and the the wait staff sing and dance throughout the restaurant, in between tables and aisles.  They also pick out people to dance with them. So, if that's not your thing you may want to skip this place. As for the food and drinks, we ordered sake and different hand rolls. All visually beautiful and delicious. It was a very fun atmosphere, perfect place to visit when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Two Words: Sake ROKS!  Sake Rok redefines the conventional dining experience by bringing a spectacle of culinary creations and eclectic performances.  Part Culinary: Chef Bobby Silva showcases his unique culinary skills with a menu of Japanese popular dishes with a unique twist of fusion. The menu varies with shared plates of Crispy Sashimi Tacos to irresistible entrees such as their Pan-Seared Scallops. They have unique offerings of sushi rolls: Puff the Magic Dragon Roll with snow crab, avocado, eel, eel sauce, and fresh cucumber. Be sure to ask your friendly server about their one-of-a-kind Godzilla Platter!  As for alcoholic drinks, their highlights include their specialty cocktails such as Whiskey On The Rok which is their \"signature five spice infused old fashioned featuring Old Forester Bourbon.\" Be adventurous and order their signature Sake Bombs!   They may be known for their fresh sushi and house sake, but they also have tender and flavorful steak. My personal favorite: Their enticing 42 oz Wagyu Tomahawk Steak with foie gras and rich butter.   For dessert, I highly recommend their Honey Toast, it is undeniably mouthwatering! They say that the portion is large enough to share with several, but you would NOT want to share it after one savory bite.   Part Performance: Sake Rok transforms into an alluring spectacle: their multi-talented servers are also your entertainers!  The interactive entertainers invite you, their guests, to be part of the vivacious spectacle.   This is not just a place to dine or to spectate --- it is a place that encourages all of us to let loose and release our inhibitions. Come ready to immerse yourself to an unexpected and unforgettable experience!"}
{"text":"The place is really cool, the food is mediocre and really expensive. Service is good, everyone is very nice and you will have a good time."}
{"text":"We thought this sounded like a great experience. We were very excited and planned our day around coming here for dinner.  We had reservations for 5:30pm.  When we arrived the server informed us that the show part doesn't happen until 6:30pm or later, and they were fully booked.  Wasn't  worth staying around for."}
{"text":"Sake Rok is the best Japanese restaurant I have been to for several reasons. First, the food is absolutely sensational. Our specialty rolls were expertly crafted with the freshest ingredients and tasted heavenly. The Salt and Pepper Shrimp was so good we were about to pay the bill and leave but simply had to order another round yum! The food was top notch all the way but what sets Sake Rok apart is the high level entertainment and kindness of the staff. The servers are also incredible dancers and bust into routines periodically for guests viewing pleasure! It was my Step-dad's 60th Bday and Sake Rok made it sooo special. They brought him up on stage, sat him in a big chair, and had beautiful woman dance all around him. After that they hooked him up with a ninja headband which he proudly boasted the duration of our Vegas Trip and referred to himself as the Sake bomb ninja king lol. During our night at Sake Rok the Owner, GM, and Host made the effort to engage with our table which left us all glowing! Thank you for such a memorable experience we will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing energy and even more amazing food!! The Brussels sprouts, pork dumplings, tempura shrimp, and spicy tuna roll will change your life!  Live DJ and talented server/dancer entertainment kept the party vibe up throughout the evening.  Service was excellent and food orders prompt.  Perfect place for bachelorette parties, dinner with friends, and the 3rd level private event space balcony is truly spectacular.  Sake Rok is pure Vegas awesomeness!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sake Rok multiple times whether with business colleagues or even my mother, and every time was fun delicious and consistent!  My favorite bites, in no particular order:  -salmon sashimi -tuna belly toro sashimi -mushroom side dish (I can't remember the name, but it's amazing) -tuna tacos -HONEY. TOAST.  I used to always get honey toast from Ichiza, but Sake Rok's really is better. The cubed brioche inside with butter, cinnamon and honey, with their vanilla custard is unreal. Save room for it.  And, having grown up on N'sync and Backstreet Boys, I personally love the throwback performances the staff does. *Pro tip* Park in the parking garage of the Monte Carlo and scan Nevada ID (or borrow a friend's!) to get free parking! I'm going to try to limit myself this week, but head over there soon!"}
{"text":"We have the best server ever she's also our bartender her name is Joy she is just wonderful very pleasant our martinis were extremely dirty the way we like them. We will be back and I think they're giving Newport a run for their money"}
{"text":"If you are just looking for entertainment and don't care about food, prices, and overall quality, this is your place.  Food portions are tiny, plain tasting, and way over priced. But at least you have a guy that looks like Jesus with costume make-up singing to you."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the absolute highlight of our Vegas girls trip. We celebrated two 21st birthdays and an engagement, and Sake Rok made us feel as if we were celebrating with family. The food is excellent, the staff is upbeat and entertaining, and the music kept us singing and dancing all night. All 12 of us will be returning to Sake Rok if any of us come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was average, but very disappointed in the service.   We are a table of 7 and one of our entrees did not arrive until 45 min after the rest of our party finished eating.  We are all locals and will not be returning here again.  The straw that broke the camels back for me what the excuse of the delayed order being a hot plate is why it's taking longer than the sushi.  Wtf!  Really?  You're an idiot!  It's simple, either the waitress forgot to put the order in or the chef is a complete baboon!  Needless to say, the entire group will share this bad experience and we will not return as locals that enjoy different places. Try again Sake Rok!"}
{"text":"OMG! We have been here 3 times now upon arrival to LV and each time it has been a fantastic way to\"let loose!\" GREAT job, Amy & company!"}
{"text":"Will not come back, Miso soup is terribly salty,the rok and roll sushi roll is a joke, only 4 prizes to a roll"}
{"text":"Decent prices for the strip I feel! We were surprised and first with prices, but then remembered it was VEGAS. Loud inside, its basically hard-rock, but sushi! Great hosts, they really get into it....albeit its cheesy at times!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC. We waited 15 minutes just to get water, OVER 20 for soy sauce (which we never got) spent 60$ for 3 disgusting rolls. Save your money, we were excited for sushi in Vegas. I would have rather spent 60 gambling and lost it all. This place should be out of business already."}
{"text":"WOW! This place was amazing. I saw a guy order the Tomahawk steak on the Godzilla Platter, it was so cool. The atmosphere was pure Vegas extravagance. Really a unique experience."}
{"text":"Was here for the Super Bowl. Had a great time,service was great,plenty of food and booze. They did not over sell the party. Woild recommend any party here."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite but tasty as well. We originally were looking for another sushi place but could not find and opted for Sake Rok. We entered greeted by the hostess who looks at my friend and says I'm not sure we can seat you with your attire. She was wearing a bikini top, with a wrap skirt, and sandals. I look around and it's not super fancy plus there was like only 2 other people in the entire restaurant. Anyhow my friend tells her not to worry the wrap turns into a dress to and she covered up.  We were seated and our waiter came along 2 mins later order drinks gave us menus. So we were so hungry and wanted to order it all. The one thing that caught my eye was the shishito peppers which I had to try.  Ordered the shishito peppers, edamame rok with asian garlic butter & chili, El Chapo Roll, Volcano Roll and Tiger roll. They ALL were a hit and taste was so good.  Now after we got our food it's like all the waiters went to hide in the back we were not asked for refills on drinks nor could we find anyone to get the check.  Overall food is fabuous and Service is slow..."}
{"text":"The best part is the staff that provides a nice show during your meal (though the guy with the microphone could give it a rest every once in a while-he's really loud and a little obnoxious). During our dinner, they danced to 2 songs which was really fun! The sushi is good (not the best) but overpriced. Some specialty rolls have a fun play on flavors which are great to try if you're adventurous and they also have your regular rolls of tuna, eel and avocado, eel and cucumber, etc if you want your typical rolls. Everything we tried was fresh. There's a good variety of apetizers but the weird thing is we ordered the dumplings and they were served in halves, 5 of them, what happened to the 6th half (that would make for 3 whole dumplings)? Did it get served to another table? The drinks are tasty, as expected at $14. The place is spacious with 2 floors and the decor is bare brick walls with cool Japanese inspired paintings. Heads up: it is a loud place making it hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Best show in Vegas!!! Best sake in Vegas! Awesome sushi! Simone kept the party going, and Amanda was a fantastic waitress and better dancer than Justin Timberlake!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but a bit pricey. Was excited for the dancing part of the experience but I guess Monday night at 6pm it just doesn't happen."}
{"text":"This place has it all! Amazing food wonderful service and some yummy drinks! Did I mention the art and decor is the cats meow! We went for lunch but was told to defiantly come at night for the real fun.  Big thank you to manager Michael for such a warm welcome and our server Jerrick for all the great recommendation."}
{"text":"We had a reservation which was perfect because they were ready for us. It is a unique atmosphere in that they have performers and servers. I think the performers out way the service staff because it took at least 30 minutes to order and get drinks for a table of six. My friends and I were ready to drink so only getting our drinks right before sushi was disappointing. That means I only had 1 drink. So they missed out on us spending more. My fiancé got the drink that smoked. When it came to the table though it was such a disappointment. Just a little smoke in a box. Looked a lot like blowing out a candle to me.  I'm gluten free so the server was able to recommend a few options and even keep sauces on the side with gluten. They also had gluten free soy sauce. This may not seem like a big deal but it's been difficult to find gluten free sushi so I really appreciate their accommodations.  I liked the show throughout the meal. It was definitely entertaining to watch. We had to wait for a longtime on the check too. So by the end I was over the performance."}
{"text":"Walked up to get a couple drinks. Ordered a Jamo with sprite and a rye whiskey Manhattan which after second bad attempt I give up. Bartenders should either know their drinks or have a referee tool they use."}
{"text":"Party (SAKE) Rock! I'm pretty sure that's the original name of the LMFAO song, but they had to change it for copyright reasons. Because Sake Rok is a total party atmosphere, complete with an MC, dance routines, a ridiculous number of shots, and crazy-loud music. Sake Rok isn't a restaurant so much as it's an immersive experience with food. It wasn't what I expected at all, but our large group had a great time!  The menu features mostly sushi dishes, with expected pricing for the Strip location. Splurge for the Godzilla sushi platter or a handful of apps and rolls to share. Standouts for us were the Sashimi Tacos (eat them fast or the shells will get soggy!), Rock Shrimp Tempura (great spicy kick!), Japanese-Style Elote (didn't expect to like this but it was a hit at the table!), and the Honey Toast Boat (easily enough to feed 10). Everything was beautifully presented, fresh, and full of flavor. There are entree and steak dishes for those in your party who don't like it raw.  Service was attentive, especially the host who was leading the dance routines, interacting with diners, and encouraging the consumption of sake bombs. I have no idea how he was still standing after the first hour, but he had a great personality and went out of his way to make a personal connection with guests. Sake Rok wouldn't be my pick for a date night, but if you have a bachelor/bachelorette party or a birthday to celebrate, make a reservation!"}
{"text":"The sushi was teeny tiney in size. Prices were deceptive. $5 for only 1 piece. They should have said $10 for a normal order of 2 pieces. And if the portion is going to be tiny, at least give you enough rice under the fish. So small of rice portion that the sushi fell apart before you stick it in your mouth. Come on, it rice! Where's the beef???"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I took my wife here for her birthday before the Bruno Mars concert and it was great! The sushi was fresh, we had the El Chapo, Tempura and Tiger rolls...all were amazing. The entertainment was even better, the MC was so fun and kept the place full of energy. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that CAESAR, the chefs & the performers deserve 6 stars. They were great!  However, the whole dinner experience was one of the worst that my boyfriend and I have had. We bought a \"dinner & a show\" package for Valentine's day so our dinner was prepaid. We showed up at 7pm and our show was at 9:30pm. A couple minutes after being seated, Caesar came over and offered us some water and told us who our server would be (can't remember her name but I'm assuming she's new). Maybe 5 minutes later our server came over to take our drink and food orders. The table across from us got their drinks and food before we even got our drinks and we got there before them. It took 15 minutes just to get one of our drinks and it was only because we told Caesar we didn't get it yet. 20 minutes later Caesar saw that we didn't have our food so he went to check and the waitress didn't even put our order in. Finally, our food came out and we were happy that Caesar was checking in on us. Half way through our meal they brought my boyfriend another drink that we didn't ask for.  When we asked Caesar for a box he told our original waitress to get us a box, which took her 5 minutes. We then had to ask for our bill and 10 minutes later (8:50pm) she comes back and says she has to get a manager to check our prepaid receipt. 5 minutes later the manager comes down, looks at the receipt then says \"so what's the question?\" When I told him that we were just waiting for our final bill he seemed confused as to why the waitress even called him over. We left at 9:15 to go to our show. Our finally bill charged us for two of my boyfriends drinks even though we only ordered one. We would have corrected them but didn't want to wait another 20 mins for our waitress to figure out what she was doing.   Long story short, that waitress either needs better training or shouldn't be a waitress if she can't handle more than one table at a time.   I recommend this place for the atmosphere, the entertainment, & the food. Definitely ask for Caesar's table."}
{"text":"You Rock Sake Rok!! Wooo!! You Go Glen Coco!! Hahaha! Sake Rok is KILLIN the game in ENTERTAINMENT dinning. Let me start by saying I was stalking this restaurant before it even opened thanks to Eater's column for new openings in Vegas. WOW am I glad this was a destination fulfilled!   Having only been opened for a month I was beyond ecstatic to try this place. Being in a good local was also a perk because I was able to experience the new Park and see the  new majestic Dancer statue! Upon entering, I loved the glowing lanterns that were on display in the foyer which immediately gave a vibrant electric feel against all of the dope graffiti art lining the walls. We did not have reservations and we were sat at the sushi bar which was fine but it was uncomfortable having to wiggle around in my seat to look back at all of the entertainment, which is why, I highly recommend you make reservations in advance!   We ordered: ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA  TEMPURA ROLL TIGER ROLL  Everything we had was amazing! The rock shrimp was an appetizer and a hefty portion was given. It was very spicy and crunchy and completely savory! The tempura isn't your average tempura roll. The entire roll was deep fried! Sinful! And my tiger roll was more a common roll but still delicious! I wouldn't recommend ordering too much tempura choices bc that's a lot of fried food for one sitting. 5 stars for food!   Vegas is the entertainment capital of the world and Sake Rock knows how to be that bold outlier, shameless in their performance, and all out flamboyant! Props to the David Bowie, kmono and spiky platform wearing, MC that kept the party rolling all night! Lights, camera, action, starting at 7:30pm and every half hour after, your severs will perform full out choreographed dances from Afro wearing MoTown to Lady Gaga Born This Way, and even Madonna Vogue! They wil throw money from the balcony! Dolla Dolla Billz Ya'll! They will stunt and be carried high in the air! I have no idea how organized and n'sync they stay from multi tasking, serving an entire restaurant and keeping up with all the dance moves, never spilling anything and always staying on beat! Shiz! Tip your sever well! They are straight up party gurus and the definition of work hard play hard!   The Restrooms are Unisex so Ladies don't feel weird walking into the bathroom with a male attendant. If you want privacy take care of fixing yourself up in your stall bc it can get a little weird in front of the communal mirror. I personally didn't like this. I was adjusting my dress at the communal sinks just as the male attendant was handing me a hand towel and it made for an extremely awkward moment. As well as a little uncomfortable. Then to make up for it the attended tried a go at small talk and I just wanted to get out of the bathroom. Lol. Smh. Fair waring.   Ranging about $60 for two people with non alcoholic drinks it's totally worth the visit. I recommend coming in a big group bc the MC will notice your table and get you up and dancing and take sake bombs with you and you can have a mini keg at your table! This place is almost better for groups than coming in as 2 people so invite the squad! If I could, I would totally quite my day job just to be a Sake Rok girl!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. It's certainly a lot of fun - however its pretty pricey and the food is not always that good. But then if you wanted quality sushi you probably wouldn't end up at a place like this anyway. Go with a large group and do a few Sake bombs!"}
{"text":"Great service!! I absolutely love the vibe and atmosphere that sake rok has provided!"}
{"text":"We came after a concert at T mobile arena and apparently after they were finished dancing:( Sad that we missed that, but still glad we came.   This place likes spice, just about everything I ordered had a kick to it.   Rok shrimp tempura- a must order!!! Spicy yet delicious!!!!  Hamachi Serrano- this was recommended by our waitress and she was spot on!!!  I'm definitely coming back here, and hopefully I'll catch the performance next time!!!"}
{"text":"Had a really fun time! It wasn't full, but the guy in drag was great and even got us sake bombs (after we told him all about how we just got engaged!). The food was good, but everything was pricey. The best food that we had was the Kobe beef sliders - we could have had that as an entree easily! Definitely don't miss those."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday, no events at T-Mobile bc as a local I was not going to deal with the crowds. We parked at NYNY and walked through the park. It looked empty but as we walked inside the place was packed.   There's a DJ playing great music that was perfect for a hip upbeat environment. It's music you want to groove to. A mix of new & old school top 40. The staff randomly dances to Madonna, another to *NSYNC vs BSB. Me & the hubs had a really fun time eating amazing food & just a really fun environment.   We decided to order a bunch of small plates to share which was perfect so we could also get dessert.  Rok shrimp - little nuggets of shrimp friend in a light tempura batter then tossed in a spicy cream sauce. This was my favorite.   Karage chicken - lightly battered fried chicken nuggets served with a ginger ponzu sauce to dip in.   S&P shrimp - skewered fried shrimp fried & served with a creamy, I think cilantro sauce. Not a spicy as I was expecting.   Scallops - so tender & juicy & perfectly seared. I'm not sure what type of sauce/broth it was served with but it was delicious.   El Chappo roll - it was good but again it said spicy but was lacking that kick. I would try different roll next time.   Edemame Rok - spicy & refreshing bc of the lime/lemon seasoning.   Honey toast - the best thing they have. Cinnamon sugar crusted croutons, stuffed on a vanilla custard topped with fresh berries & vanilla ice cream. It reminded me of cream brûlée, honey toast & captain crunch had a baby. I may go back just for this.   We had to get a sake bomb to join in on the sake Rok sake bomb fun. A nice draft Kirin was perfect pairing with the meal."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!!! The saff, the food,  the drinks,  the ambient...incredible!!!! Especially  Annahita, she is so kind abs attentive I felt like I have known her for ever.  She is amazing.  I can't wait to come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for their industry night on a Tuesday. The music was so loud it totally distracted me from the food. I couldn't talk a lot because the music was so loud and gave me a headache. There was annoying weird dancing going on and an even more annoying MC. I get they are trying to do something different and that's cool but it's a little cheesy I think when I'm trying to eat sushi. Perhaps on a regular day it would be nice to eat here by I'm so turned off that I will need a minute. I have no complaints about the food. There were some interesting flavors."}
{"text":"I came to sake rok and was completely blown away by the amazing service the bar back Kenny marzola provided. It was above and beyond what I expected. Nothing says party like sake rok! Thanks to all the staff for the hospitality, warm welcome, good times, and entertainment"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday evening for dinner with my girlfriends and it was such a blast!  Right when you walk in, you can see the beautiful murals and fun staff that is all over the restaurant.  We sat on level one where the nice bar is on one side and the sushi bar is on the opposite side. There is also a DJ booth right in the middle of the restaurants.  The second floor has seats that looks down into the first floor with guests watching the show.  We had prime seating close the the center bar.    The wait staff was amazing and there is an \"MC\" that comes by all the table and chats with everybody to make sure you're enjoying the food and show.  He also takes sake bombs with the guests. (I can't believe how much this guy can drink!!)  Then food comes very quickly and its AMAZING!!!  The prawns, roasted chicken, sushi rolls, and drinks were out of this WORLD!!  So good.    My favorite is the Stuffed French Toast!!   All the girls I came with were so stuffed with food.  It was just so delicious!  BONUS: Plates get cleared away fast so you know service is fab here.  This is definitely an entertainment venue.  You're going to experience a fun and interactive setting.   If you're coming for a quiet dinner,you probably want to try something else or I'd ask for the 2nd level. This is definitely more of a night out with your girlfriends or a bachelor party for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Since we had 1 more hour before it would be time to head to the airport and a voucher for BOGO beers we decided to stop and have a quick drink. We had been wanting to try the food and nightlife at Sake Rok but just didn't have time during our trip. Nonetheless our chill afternoon on the patio was nice. Their is a bar facing the outside of the restaurant so we ordered there. The bartender was really cool, really friendly and told us all about their beers and drinks they had to offer. We decided to try a Japanese imported porter which turned out to be really good ($9 a can though). We had a good time people watching and hanging out during our last hour of our trip. Their food looks really good, hopefully we'll get a chance to try next time."}
{"text":"Had the tiger roll, rok and roll, agedashi tofu, cucumber maki. The best part of this restaurant is the show they put on. The host is funny and entertaining. The dancers are pretty. I didn't do the sake bomb but it was fun to watch people drink it. Food could have been better."}
{"text":"Sake Rok was accommodating as my reservation was for 15 minuets before closing on a Saturday. The Rok specialty rolls, shrimp tempura and drinks were excellent and would highly recommend the Pagota punch bowl if you have two to four drinkers. It's a bit much for two unless you want to get drunk. ($50 - per punch bowl)  I didn't like how loud the place was. I knew there were performances but we could hear the music from the performances in our room at Park MGM. If you want to yell at each other at the table while eating, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Sushi is nothing special although the entertainment and vibes are good (super duper loud so if you're looking for conversation maybe avoid this spot). For the price, on the strip, this is a fine choice, just don't expect to be blown away. Wine pours are small. The Wagu sliders were probably the favorite thing we had. We spent $225 including tip for a party of 5, which only included 3 drinks, and left still hungry. Went next door for chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"A lot of the 1 star reviews seem to be about the portion size of the meals and I have to agree. But my main issue was the service. When our server came to take our ordered I let her know I wanted a tempura roll and a bowl of the ramen and her response was \"That's it?\" First of all, what would be the issue with ordering that for two people plus drinks. I find it extremely rude to question the lack of portions for my order. There is a warning about the volume and the vibe of the restaurant before being seated. My boyfriend and I thought there would be loud music but the restaurant MC was more annoying than entertaining. I would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Our concierge recommended this place and we were excited to try it out. We were told the servers perform songs in between serving their tables and that sounded like a great time for dinner.   We arrived at 10:00pm and the place was pretty packed but they sat us right away. The decor was cool, the music was loud but not blaring, the clientele looked young and fun, the performing servers did a great job entertaining the crowd, etc.   The Service:  We were sitting there for about 10min and were never handed menus. Fine, it's busy, I understand. Although I saw our server walking around the restaurant, I didn't see him doing anything specific. I tried plenty of times to make eye contact/flag him down but he simply forgot we were there or something. But then a new table was seated right next to us and they were handed their menus, then their drinks, then their appetizer... all before we were even given menus. Eventually, our waiter came by and quickly dropped off menus and said he'd be right back. The problem was that he didn't come back for another 15min which meant we were there for 25min in total just waiting for someone to come by to take a beer order. My friend and I agreed that if our server didn't come by in the next few minutes then we were leaving. Sure enough, those minutes rolled around so we picked up our purses to head out and who walks on over but our server asking if we're ready with our drink orders (Seriously? drink orders? we've been ready with those for 20min). So I said to him \"Listen, we were just getting up to leave. I understand that it's busy for you guys but not a single person acknowledged us or even thought to take a drink order.\" Our server then said \"Oh, sorry guys, I'll take care of you.\" Since we were both starving, we gave him our small order and hoped it would come quickly.  We noticed how many tables were emptying so we were curious to check what time they closed. Found out the place closed at 10:00pm (right when we arrived) which made the whole experience worse. You'd think that if a place was closing then they'd do their best to get those tables taken care of so they can leave sooner. Instead, we were there until 11pm even though we only had a small dinner.  We looked over our check at the end to see that our server didn't \"take care of us\" like he implied earlier. I mean, I thought that meant at the very least a comped beer to lessen the blow that he forgot about us for 30min. Instead, I felt like he walked all over us.  The Food: Our entire dinner order was one edamame appetizer, two rolls each (so 4 total), and two large beers and it all came out to $100 before tip. The sushi itself was pretty mediocre and the garlic edamame was much spicier than we anticipated. The sad thing was that we were both hungry only a few hours after spending all that money on that tiny dinner. There are countless top quality places in Vegas and I see no point in returning to this restaurant.   tl;dr Although this place had an upbeat atmosphere, it was way overpriced and the risk of crappy service again seems too high. Not my type of sushi joint."}
{"text":"A group of us (six people) walked in this evening around 9:15. We may not have been your usual crowd (crossdressers) but we were dressed well and kept to ourselves. There was what looked like an office gathering near us, sure they stared but didn't bother us. We sat down and ordered our food.  We were starting to wonder when our food didn't arrive after 30 mins. It wasn't busy and most tables were already eating - we were the only new party that was seated. We asked numerous people what the deal was and we got no definitive answer. We kept looking at the sushi \"chefs\" and they just looked at us with blank stares. Weren't they wondering why we were just sitting there with no food? They kept staring at us and not doing anything about it. Even the entertainer was wondering where our food was.  When some of our food arrived, we were thinking our food was finally coming. Nope. We continued to wait for another 30 minutes. No other tables were being sat and at this point, the sushi area was starting to close down. Shortly thereafter, the manager came over and said the waiter \"forgot\" to put our order in. So you mean to tell us that he put in part of our order (which was also incorrect) and then he forgot to put in the rest? We all felt super annoyed and upset. We got up and left.  If you're a trans person, crossdresser or anything similar, do not go here. They are NOT T FRIENDLY. They will smile in your face and treat you with no respect. If you're not a trans person, DO NOT come here. There are far better places than this in Vegas. We all felt discriminated against tonight and its a horrible feeling.  You would think in this day and age (and especially this town) restaurants would be cool with a group of crossdressers coming in for a meal. Instead our worst fears came to light.  This was really unfortunate."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of 6 to celebrate a girls weekend. I made a reservation here not really understanding that it was about more than just sushi. What a blast! Absolutely a great way to kick off our night. Ben was our server and he was AMAZING! He took fantastic care of our group, kept our drinks filled, and he was just so much fun and added to our great night! The sushi here was delicious too, but this place really is an experience. Jonnis was also awesome. All the sarcasm we dished out, he dished back. Such a great crew here and stellar service. A must stop place if you are wanting to set the tone for your night!"}
{"text":"I am fully aware that sushi prices in Vegas are elevated, however I was so incredibly disappointed in both the quality of the sushi combined with the high prices. Also, their selection of rolls was very mediocre."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great environment. Absolutely recommend it! They play old school music, they have people performing songs from the BSB, n sync, the waiters really make sure you are having the best time!"}
{"text":"Excellent creative cocktails but a little too sweet. Service was PERFECT. The decor is very fun and amazing. Sushi rolls were tasty. The huge heavy menu was an interesting gimmick but it's also a pain in the ass, get rid of it in my opinion. Too many items on the menu weren't different enough from each other. The pork belly soup was excellent. The spicy tuna roll was the new style, very soft, tasty, not just a mouth of cheap tuna and sriracha like some places. The yellowtail was of excellent quality."}
{"text":"I came tonight and don't normally write 1 star reviews but this place definitely deserves it!! For $20 I got 5 pieces of a volcano roll, the rice was over cooked and DONT RELY ON THOSE YELP REVIEW PICTURES, it was far from it and I was very disappointed. Might I mention I am a sushi addict and get it once a week!! NOT to mention the host and the bartender were very rude, they acted like that didn't have time for you and were very short! I am the kind of person that always says please and thank you and both those women just stared back at me with no response! I'm from LA and come to Vegas at least 4-5 times a year, I will not be recommending this place to anyone or be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst sushi restaurant ever.  The piece roll super small. And over price!!!!  The sashimi all in tiny pieces and not tasty. Don't wanna come anymore"}
{"text":"It's not a bad restaurant just ok. Food ok the environment is really nice though, fun with a live DJ on the day I was there. If family came out to visit and they wanted sushi I would not take them here. There's not a lot of options and I just enjoy a more authentic Japanese sushi menu when it comes to the rolls."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Customer service is great! I came here with 3 friends and told the waitress how much we wanted to spend altogether and the chef just gave us different plates which included appetizers, entrees, and dessert. All yummy! Especially the Brussels sprouts!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was really good.  Our first time here.  They had 2 big parties,  service was extremely slow though it wasn't really crowed"}
{"text":"The two stars are ONLY for the food, the friendly bartender, and the decor.  Aside from that, TERRIBLE service. My friend and I are both locals who were excited to try a new place on the strip before heading in to T-Mobile arena. However, we were both severely disappointed. We were seated, and nobody came over to give us menus, or explain the setting to us. I had to ask one of the bussers/runners for menus. After a bit someone did come over and give us water.  We waited so long that one of the sushi chefs asked us if we'd received any service. The only thing that happened after that was the busser/runner tried to bring us a couple of giant sized menus.  Our server ignored us, while greeting and checking on other tables. At one point she stopped by and said she'd be right back (after her dance number), yet she disappeared. In fact, she only popped up after we flagged down a manager. After we got our food, the server then basically ignored us repeatedly. When we were nearly done with our meal, the server finally checked to see if we wanted more drinks, however, we declined because we figured we would never get them before we had to leave. My friend complained to the manager who did not do anything aside from give us his business card and tell us that he'd take care of some stuff if we come back. Great food, but such terrible service I'd be hard pressed to go back or suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Ok.....service is crazy slow even @ 2:30 they had two waiters for the entire place....One of the rolls we got tasted like it was canned tuna. House salad was good though...."}
{"text":"Had such a great time here highly recommend the Effen Sake Bomb such a fun way to drink it! Coming back for more...food was delish had the salmon"}
{"text":"Sake rok is so much fun!!! The food is great. Our server Amy was so great! The emcee cesear, really made the whole experience!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but VERY overpriced. Coming from Southern California, I'd rather wait for better quality sushi at a better price at home. Won't be back again. Gave it a shot. Better and more affordable spots in vegas. $10 for a Goose Island IPA is absurd. Save your money. Sushi is good but very tiny. Bring your magnifying glass or you might miss it."}
{"text":"Sake Rok is a different dining experience that I highly recommend. The atmosphere is high energy and ensures everyone will have a fun show while eating delicious sushi. Be prepared to have many sake bombs with the MC."}
{"text":"Been coming to Sake Rok now since they opened and each time have been amazing. From the service, entertainment all the way to the food.... Yes the food is incredible!  If your a local or a tourist visiting our great city, this is a bucket list stop for fun dining."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely phenomenal! I called the day of to make a reservation before the concert. No problem! AND as we men know with women taking their time, I called to say we are running late and they reassured us not to worry.  When we checked in, there was a wait with guests, but we were escorted right in to our table. The hostess was pleasant and the wait staff very attentive. They provide complimentary edamame which was a pleasant surprise. We ordered three sushi rolls and a sashimi platter. The presentation and taste, not to mention the freshness of the sashimi was amazing!   The topping on the cake was the \"show\" that was put on as entertainment. Superb high energy with a great Pre party vibe! Hands down, I definitely would return back to Sake Rock! Plus is conveniently located across the Park Theatre and next to the T-Mobile theatre within the Monte Carlo Hotel area."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Place was clean and I liked the interior designs of the location. Service was nice but ordering was a hassle. We could only order 5 things off the buffet menu a time. Meaning 1 piece of sushi was already 1 out of the 5 so ordering 5 each time was a hassle. Could be better if they just make however many we asked since it's a buffet. Order 5 pieces of sushi for 2 people every 10-20 minutes was annoying. Other than ordering process it was good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how Sake Rok has such a high rating. I was very disappointed. The food was okay, but completely overpriced. I got a 4-piece roll, 2 pieces of nigiri, and a house Chardonnay for $50. The show was a few dancers who did a competition between N Sync and Backstreet Boys. I mean, what year is it??? The decor was kind of cool and the bathroom attendant was sweet. I would suggest going somewhere else for sushi though."}
{"text":"I truly wanted to love this place given the staff was kind and welcoming...  But both Matt and I felt that the food stayed otherwise.  All plates we had were beyond too salty to even enjoy.   The bottle of sake we got was the worst sake we've ever had, being from Hollister CA.   And I think it just.. was too salt over all.   Matt and I had: Crispy rice appetizer - think of a 50¢ quarter sized rice about a centimeter high, soaked in a salty sauce, topped with spicy tuna.... may or hold off of the sauce? We actually asked to have it taken back and the waiter was more than welcome to take it off of our bill for us.   We also tried scallops here... unfortunately it was too salty as well. Decorated with green chives and a foam on top and veggies on the bottom.   Matt said if he didn't order a side of rice, the food would've not been eatable...   We had two rolls. I forget their names but both were on the spicy side. Salty as well.  I'm not sure if salt was accidentally spilled on our food or.... people don't mind it but we literally left half of our food.    Mind you, it came to about a $110 bill including tip... for mediocre sushi.   There's too many employees standing around I feel like, just kinda staring at the dining room or people eating.. it's weird."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Sake Rok since they opened and it appears a \"management shake-up\" for the worse occurred since our last visit. Unfortunately, this time our overall experience failed our expectations. Most of the food was heavily salted and they actually forgot one of our sushi rolls after they said it was \"on its way.\" Really? The music was pathetic by playing N'Sync and Backstreet Boys songs for a place called \"Sake Rok.\" However, I did enjoy the dancers and overall entertainment because they tried hard to entertain us, so kudos to them! But, by far the worst part was the service because our server disappeared more often than he appeared. We had to flag him down many times just to get service if we could find him!!! So, based on this experience and with so many other Japanese-themed Strip restaurants to choose from, we will never be coming back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a trendy, hipster dining experience with above average Japanese food - this may be the place for you.   As mentioned in other reviews these folks really pride themselves on the entertainment factor with the dancing and singing etc so if you're looking for a unique experience I'd really suggest it because lots of people were having fun.   However it did seem to take away from the service delivery on the dining side:  We were seated by the Door was which was open on a chilly evening. We asked for the door to be closed or for us to be moved. We were told that the door couldn't be closed (?) but when they realized that they had reservations which prohibited from us being moved they finally closed the door. However at the end of the meal they opened the door again. We were close to the end of the meal so we didn't push the issue but the draft was pretty annoying.  Food comes out as its prepared. Bussers are  very quick to bus your table but they'd take EVERYTHING away so we'd have to ask for additional plates and silverware on a couple of occasions.  We ordered the Brussel sprouts which never arrived. When we asked at the end of the meal to make sure we weren't charged the server said they were still being cooked (over an hour at this point). We paid our bill and the server said the food was still coming even though we weren't being charged. We finished our drinks but after another 15 minutes we were done and still no Brussel sprouts so we left. Not that we were still hungry but still...   They push Sake bombs pretty hard at this place. I'm no prude by any means and have had more than a few in my day so when the emcee came over to introduce herself and starred pushing them I said we would buy a round if she joined us. She said that sounded awesome and would join us so I bought a round for the table and her. However when the shots came she made up an excuse as to why she couldn't take the shot. No big deal but because of the hard sell we felt like there was a bit of a bait and switch.  These things are all easily fixed and when they are this place will be a solid 4 if you're looking for that kind of vibe and experience. Until then a solid 3."}
{"text":"The Goods 1. First time sushi and raw fish and I loved it.  Was so scared but it just tastes that good  2. Yellow tail tacos: yum and you mainly taste he citrus sauce  3. Delicious cocktails and shots   Service  1. Friendly and definitely wild 2. The guy kept hosting a party and was very wild with the same bombs! Only in Vegas  3. Sometimes they dance on the bar tables, a show to be seen  Ambiance  1. Dim and clubby  2. Feels hip and stylish with a bit of funk 3. Fairly priced   MoJo 1. Try the shots and the shrimp !!!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what I was getting into when we made reservations at Sake Rok. Reservations on a weekend are likely a good idea, as we arrived for dinner there were many patrons waiting outside in the 100+ heat waiting for a table.   Everything looked normal at first, but within minutes the lights went out, loud music blasted, and staff came running out in wigs and glasses and began dancing on the bar and around the restaurant. This was a pleasant, fun surprise for us, as we were out for a bachelorette celebration, but those with their family trying to have a nice, quiet sushi meal should look elsewhere. The host was a complete crack up. He had wild and crazy makeup, luscious, long, curls (way to go if that is your natural hair) and very flamboyant outfits that he changed regularly throughout our meal. He did an excellent job of keeping the restaurant alive and engaged.    Our table ordered the sake bomb special, which was $80 and included a very small pony keg of beer and two porcelain tokkuri of sake. This was enough for about 14 sake bombs, which made them about $5.70 each. The host came over and did one with us, while announcing the entire process to the restaurant over the microphone.   The sushi was expensive, but I'll admit that's because I come from the land of affordable \"all you can eat\" sushi in Northern Nevada. Each roll was $20, plus or minus a few dollars. Side items like edamame, miso, etc., were $6 each. This ended up being a very expensive outing for our group of 8, but the atmosphere was really fun and lively, and the food was fine.   Certainly not the best sushi I've ever had, but if I found myself back in Vegas with friends looking for a fun meal, I'd return."}
{"text":"After a 2 day tournament, my teammates and I were ready to wrap the weekend up and have a nice sushi dinner. Little did we know what Sake Rok had in store for us! What we thought was going to be a fun dinner and good conversation turned out to be all that plus singing, dancing, and sake bombs! The food was delicious and the staff worked with us to set up a price point and created a varied menu, which is a huge help with a large group like ours.   I would highly recommend Sake Rok for any groups looking to have a good time in Vegas! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey but amazing service and clever entertainment. It so happened to be my birthday and we ended up having a wonderful time,  somewhat unexpectedly! ! Great food, sake shots. Loud music, bday shoutouts as big as the WALL!!! Thank you SakeRok!"}
{"text":"What a great spot. We were sat right away. Our waitress came to the table wearing a Patriots jersey.  We immediately started arguing (in a good football way).  She was great and held her own. Everything I gave her she gave right back. Having another Pats fan at the table did not help....   Then came the food. All so good. It was my first time coming here and I will be sure to come back. It's just sad I have been in Vegas first 11 days and this was my first time coming here. I would have come back multiple times during my stay.  My only complaints is they only have low sodium soy sauce. They also messed up our order so 5 tables who where sat after us were served. This would have been fine if that was said in the first place rather then the food coming out and being told then. Other than that....this place was great. Would have been 5 stars if not for the food mishap and the lack of communication."}
{"text":"Only reason for the 2 stars is for the food. It was all very good, but the HORRIBLE service and loud annoying atmosphere made it not worth it at all. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Wow, loud and fun. Must be in the mood for a party and sushi.   Small and pricey food, however great flavor and amazing service."}
{"text":"Food was good but I was not impressed by the service.  We placed our order for a party of 4, received and ate half of our orders and our drink orders had still not shown up. We managed to get our waiters attention and remind him that we had not received our drinks yet( 2 sake bombs and a beer). He said he was going to retrieve them as well as a side dish we added on.  Side dish made it out but no drinks. Shortly after ,we had finished our meal so we stopped the first employee to walk by us and ask that he please cancel our drink orders as we are ready to go. 5 minutes later here comes another employee with our drinks, I tell him that unfortunately we are ready to go and I had informed another employee of this and asked to have the order cancelled as we had already been waiting 30 minutes for these. His response? \"I DON'T THINK SO! I haven't even been here thirty minutes but let me get you a manager because umm they're already made\". Now, I really don't care what you THINK, I KNOW how long we have been there and how long we have been waiting. That response was totally unnecessary. I get things happen and in this case most likely our server forgot to put our drink order in. A simple I'm sorry about that let me talk to my manager and see what's going on would have sufficed instead of the snarky comment. Manager came over and apologized and offered to have the drinks made to go for us. We declined and he graciously said he would have no problem taking the drinks that we did not have off the bill(thank you!) I did let him know his employees response was unwelcome but alas, the damage was already done. With the wide variety of restaurants in this city just having good food is not enough, service has to be just as good. Would not go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Love restaurants like this.  I would not take the time to come eat at your restaurant on a regular basis  because there's so many better Japanese that why bother. But this one time that I think about trying it cause I am going to an event and I am sure it should be one of your sudoeste nights. Show up to podium and the ladies ask for a reservation which I don't have. I ask for a table for two. They say they are extremely busy and would have to wait 15/20 mins for a table. So I say perfect. I guess the sushi bar works since you're so good and busy. As soon as I am being taken to bar and see the inside of the restaurant and realize there's not even 50% of the restaurant seated. I see couples on tables for 4ppl and then wonder how come you want to make me wait when your restaurant is so dead. Staff? I hope you were expecting to have more than 50% today with a sold out arena.  Anyway, good way to make sure a local who eats out all day every day never comes back to your restaurant."}
{"text":"There isn't a restaurant in Vegas like Sake Rok. The food is amazing no doubt, but it the environment atmosphere. They have an awesome MC and the servers performs. If you're looking for fun and a show definitely go to Sake Rok. It's absolutely the only real hip fun restaurant in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Ambience and service were fine. Ordered hot green tea. It came in a cute kettle but the tea didn't taste good. Opened up the kettle and pulled out the tea bag - it was Bigelow green tea, one of the cheapest tea available at a grocery store. No Japanese restaurant should serve Bigelow green tea! Makes one wonder if their fish is also of lowest quality. Did not order any fish and walked out."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 was jonesing for Asian food and had dinner here with only a minimal wait. Good music (80-90s mix mostly?) and nice dancing was part of the scene here.   We all shared 3 of their Sushi rolls, none of which were a standout, just ok. Their real star was the Brussel sprouts. Holy Moly!! They came with a phenomenal tasting sugary Bacon topping which made them hard to resist. We had three orders amongst the three of us and still wanted more.  Probably would give this place three stars but the brussels sprouts were worth seven stars (Best Brussel sprouts I have ever had), so will round up to four stars.   Service was a little slow, but our waitress made up for it with friendliness and with a good attitude. Dancers were somewhat entertaining (they dance every 30-40mins)."}
{"text":"Overpriced and extremely mediocre food. I've had better sushi rolls at a $20 all-you-can-eat joint in the Midwest suburbs. $20 here gets you two dinky, flavorless and stale maki-mono rolls. We also ordered the Chilean sea bass which was admittedly good, but for $28 it was literally the half the size of my palm with no real side! It was basically just fish with a garnish of pickled veggies and a foam on top. SERIOUSLY?  And I get this is supposed to be a \"rock and roll\" kind of place but the music was SOOOO loud. Like, loud enough to cause some real damage to your ears. I don't mind loud music if I'm at a concert or show, but this was TOO much for a restaurant. My husband and I couldn't even hear a single word we said to each other. In addition, the service was really slooow and hard to track down.  On our trip to Vegas, this was single-handedly the WORST meal of our trip and the biggest regret of us spending as much money as we did at this place. Never again will we get sushi on the Strip, just trek a mile or two on Spring Mountain if you want your sushi fix for a fraction of the price that actually tastes delicious."}
{"text":"So, were do I start?  Compliments, the chopsticks where really nice.  The busboy with the beard was very nice to look at.  We got here at 6 pm and got our food at about 7pm.  Well, let me clarify, we received out edamame at that time. We ordered a round of drinks and they took a very long time to come out.    At about 6:50 pm the server Rich T, came up to us and apologized that our order was not put in because the tables were wrong.  I have no idea what that meant.  Then he asked if he could offer us some sake.  No one in our table ordered sake.  So we did not respond.   Our food started to come out at about 7 pm.   And by food I mean our two rolls and our edamame.  My friend ordered a drink which was awful and advised the server to please replace it.  We had to remind him twice and had to get a manager to get get out the new drink.   He offered us sake again, at this point we just said okay.   The server came came back to see if we needed anything else about 7:35pm.  At which time we inquired about the rest of our order, specially our scallops.  He made a face and ran into the kitchen.  Clearly, the rest of the order was not placed.    We waited about 10 more minutes.  The order never came.  We flagged Rich down to advise him that we needed to leave and to please cancel the rest of the order.  My friend went to the manager to share his experience and was told sorry.  The check came and had items that never came.  I understand they they just opened but no one knows where the food goes.    I would not recommend this restaurant at all.  Fun atmosphere great music.   I would have loved to taste the food but it never came.  If you want cocktails and if you wanna watch servers dance, please have a few drinks.  But it was about 7pm and they ran out of items on their main menu for drink.   We had to order different items.    We requested for a male manager this time after speaking to Raika, he also apologized and stated they were not making excuses.     Our bill for 4 drinks a 3 apps was $181.   Overpriced, extreme lack of service and management had no restaurant management experience.    It was 4 of us who work in the industry and we will not return.  Do not waste your money on this over priced place."}
{"text":"I was not expecting how amazing this place ended up being. The entire experience along with the food was great. We went for my friends birthday and I was so happy that we chose this place because they went above and beyond to make it a great one. I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Potentially a Great bar, but not really a place to go eat sushi. Here on a tuesday, the place is basically empty at dinner time other than a couple families with small children (typical sight on the Vegas Strip these days). So I asked the hostess to seat me at the sushi bar. They seat me at the bar and within minutes after being served, I have 3 guys with clown wigs dancing on the bar as I am trying to eat. And the place is dead. I was 1 of maybey 9 people in the entire restaurant. Very awkward. The fish was tasty though (had 4 types of nigiri) ALL the sushi is a la cart, so it is very difficult and expensive toneat here solo. There is no \"sushi variety plate\" for solo diners which is unfortunate. To summarize, on a weekend night with a large group this place could be fun. If youre out on the strip looking to EAT sushi, I would avoid Sake Rok"}
{"text":"Overall expiernce was fun.. Lots going on.. Party atmosphere. Foods pricey but very good. Downside was MEN AND WOMEN SHARE THE BATHROOM?! WHAT THE FUCK. disgusting. Very uneasy feeling. Especially after your tipsy.. I want to feel SAFE and have privacy. Huge disappointment.  Everyone at my table refused to go to the restroom after I told them that. Our bill came out to $600.  There's plenty of space for two separate bathrooms.  End of rant."}
{"text":"The food was enjoyable, but the service and the show were even better. There is one guy who looks like Sam Smith. He's great! And is a wonderful Opera singer ."}
{"text":"Got the kamikaze roll, Puff the dragon roll and the 49th state roll and OMG these rolls were amazing!! The price of the rolls were expensive and the sizing was small, but overall the taste to it was good.   Also, there's live entertainment and it's pretty cool to watch and come here with a group.  Btw, get the Sake!"}
{"text":"The decor, ambiance, service, energy, lighting, acoustics, location, and, of course, the food are fantastic. It was late afternoon so we had a lighter meal, which was easy to do because of the excellent selection and wide variety of options (a full course meal or smaller plates with lighter fare). I had the roasted brussel sprouts (sans bacon, which was actually offered when I ordered them and I thought was an attentive gesture) and lemon roasted asparagus as well as steamed mixed vegetables and they were all exceptional. The roasted sprouts were really out of this world in flavor and texture. The portions were excellent as well. Given the variety of options there are plenty of meat as well as vegetarian options. My friend had the shrimp and rice and enjoyed both of these offerings. The shrimp sauce was unique and delicious. The staff were all extremely attentive with water glasses and drink glasses filled without us even noticing. The waitress made some menu suggestions that were spot on upon request and made the experience really exceptional. I will definitely come back especially during the evening hours when the entertainment and notable drink options will only enhance the already great experience. Congratulations on a wonderful and unique Vegas hotspot for visitors (and locals like myself)!"}
{"text":"Ordered the el Chapo roll, overpriced but good. My boyfriend claims he got sick from the mushroom tempura. Service was okay but I didn't understand the concept of the place. Plenty of better options on the strip but this place was not terrible."}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant! Definitely not your typical sushi experience.   The sushi is really really good here (although a little overpriced, like everything in Vegas) but the entertainment really steals the show - no pun intended. The service is interspersed with a wise-cracking emcee, dance shows by the servers, and lip-sync battles. I mean, it's Vegas, so nothing is subtle. Super fun if you're looking for a great Vegas experience!  Huge shoutouts to our talented server Amy and the fun and friendly emcee Caesar - He even treated us to sake bombs for my birthday!  Regardless of what food you end up ordering, I recommend starting your meal with the edamame Rock and/or miso soup - both are awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Never been to a sushi restaurant that was also a night club. Great music. Had some amazing rolls, the High Steaks roll was the best roll I've ever had. The Peter Parker roll was delicious as well. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what they offer.  Food was good and we'll-presented, though.  Service was so-so."}
{"text":"Seriously you guys. This place sake rocked my socks off. We had a party of 10 show up for an early dinner and were given Rich & Mitch as our tag team servers/entertainers/eye candy. They started off with a sake shot, of course, and then went into a whirlwind of dance, song, and some phenomenal foodsk! We gave Rich our price point per person, dietary restrictions, and he took care of all of the ordering! At one point, a Flinstones type meat bone thing came to the table, accompanied by Godzilla breathing fire. The spectacle here is off the charts folks. Every 10 mins they broke into song and dance from the 90s and included our party in all of the fun. This is by far, one of the coolest group dinners we've had! Food was spot on, entertainment was legit, and for sure, ask for RICH and MITCH to enhance your dinning experience! Can't wait to come back :) :) :)"}
{"text":"Back again last night, food was amazing, venue wasn't crazy busy but with the entertainment it felt like a packed house. They have a few new items on the menu we tried, keeps getting better. Staff has definitely gotten better from When they first open mixing service and entertainment together. Brandon one of the owners or managers was awesome he came and talked to us for a while about the different aspects of running a venue with entertainment and dinning. All around another great experience, look forward to eating there for UFC 202! Go McGregor!"}
{"text":"Finally have time to write this review...  I brought a client who eats out all the time so he is very picky on where he goes or what he eats.   We sat down and shortly after was greeted by the server, he was very sweet, polite and asked if there were certain foods we don't like or can't have then he recommended items on the menu just because my client is a SAKE ROK virgin.   While waiting for the drinks and food the MC was going around the restaurant introducing himself, cracking jokes and interacting with all the guest. Then the staff started to sing and dance and my client looks at me and says \"I haven't even had their food and I love this place already\" lol.  Food came out looked great and tasted dangerously good \"not surprised\" since I've been there before but my client looked at me again and was like WOW!!! lol  If you want great food, atmosphere and entertainment this is the best place to throw any occasion. Perfect of buy outs, birthdays, bachelor/bachelorettes parties and more.   Heads up if it is your birthday or anything special the MC will pick on you lol. Your whole table will be challenged on who drinks the sake faster, then he'll put you on stage and start dancing and singing to you.   Don't say I didn't warn you. You'll have a great time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food was great and the portions were appropriately sized. The entertainment portion of the evening was integrated into the dinner and very exciting. This place is slightly off the Strip, but worth the walk. During hockey games, it's busy early but then slows down. 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"Well let me say that I was on my honeymoon and we just were looking for a place to eat at toshiba Park. I love sushi so naturally I went t sake rok the only sushi place there. The whole vibe since we walked in was super upbeat everyone working there was like super extra happy . We ordered food I forgot what we ordered but it was amazing the food is top notch ..... it was when we were on our second sushi roll that everything just came together . The dj waiters servers and bartenders all broke into dance. They were dancing to *NSYNC and Backstreet Boys Hahhaha my husband looked at me like what the heck Veronica l. And I just didn't know wether to sing a long or what. Very interesting experience defiantly one for the books"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! The atmosphere, the people, the music is awesome! My whole family went for our family vacation. We did sake bombs which is the best way to drink. Also the crispy rice was amazing. Our servers were Carlos and Amy, who were very helpful and entertaining as well. Definitely will be back here"}
{"text":"Huge, edgy, concrete.  It's like where the villain from The Crow goes for his birthday parties. Love the art!   We ordered the El Chapo and Tiger Rolls. Both were bite-size, delicious, and perhaps more creative than the average roll. They had lots of options for people who can't hang with raw fish, but also saw many options for the more adventurous types. We also had the edamame Rok which made for a nice, flavorful appetizer (although showed up basically as dessert... don't know what happened there).   One thing I did find amusing is that they have a coed bathroom, and when I was washing my hands this guy came in and freaked out like he had unknowingly walked into the ladies' room. So, just a heads up in the event you decide to use the restroom after several sake shots and get disoriented."}
{"text":"Food was delicious the servers were so cute dancing and singing and cant forget the sake bombs!!! Must come back"}
{"text":"High energy staff and great sushi! Such a memorable night! Try the Brussels sprouts, seriously. It was part entertainment, part awesome sushi, all fun. Loved our experience here! Thanks, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great entertainment - they really bring the audience... got pulled up to dance to vouge, lol. But had fun. Played a huge mix a music and the waitress/waiters sang and danced... fun! The sushi was also yummy! Went with co-workers and we all had a good time."}
{"text":"Had heard so much about this place so we wanted to see what the hype was all about! We decided to come in for lunch. Glad it was raining and wasn't too busy today! The inside is bright, lively, and fun! Our waitress was a blonde with long hair. She greeted us right away and complimented me on my attire. She was very friendly and attentive, stopping by the table multiple times to chat! Between the two of us, we split a lunch special sashimi assortment which was a killer deal for such huge pieces of fish! It also came with a side of miso soup or salad.  Our waitress also recommended the Japanese peppers, the rok shrimp tempura which was amazing, and the rok chicken which is their spin on a teriyaki chicken. It took a little long to come out but it was absolutely with the wait. Our waitress apologized many times and surprised us with mochi at the end. Overall, we left very full and very happy! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bunny sake bomb was the best!!! Along w/the entertains staff while you are served dinner!  I didn't know I was coming in for a Backstreet Boys/*NSYNC concert!!!"}
{"text":"Just love this place.  Expected great Sake and sushi, but we had the additional surprise of a great show (spectacle) while dinning.  It made dinner so much more fun!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is a 4 star if you're maybe in your 20s, but if you want a nice meal and being able to have a conversation, this is not it. The music was just way too loud. It feels like it's trying to be a night club more than a restaurant.   The food is decently okay; definitely not the best and nothing to go gaga over.   The waiter we had was incredibly rude and went off on us for ordering something they didn't have. I mean, seriously? We spent 800+ dollars with a mandatory 22% tip and this is the service? Never coming back again..."}
{"text":"Great assortment of sushi and Asian fusion. The waitstaff is knowledgable and attentive, the place has a great overall vibe. Everything we tried was great, and the blueberry sake the waiter recommended was great. Two thumbs up. Check out the crazy big menu in our picture!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes after reading about this place. Booked a table as soon as I could. Sake Rok has laminated menus and a Russell Brand wannabe singing N'Sync songs in the bar. Bachelorette party bride sang to on a small stage. Like Chucky Cheese meets Coyote Ugly. We fled quickly.  Rebooked at Sushi Roku. Not our scene. Very New York New York. The cocktails were descent but pretty sweet. Sorry, but I'm a foodie that plays designer dress up and owns a couple sports cars. Finer things in life. This isn't my scene. It's next door to a California Pizza Kitchen. Enough said."}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a great fun and exciting atmosphere! The music is blasting the entertainment is rockn the food is amazing and the service is awesome!! We will definitely be back over and over again!! You will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for eating and entertainment, as well as celebrating special events. The staff are super friendly and they also perform for you.   However, if you're looking for a huge meal and willing to spend a lot of money on it then go for it. Sake Rok has many small plates and little entrees that are a bit pricey and can add all up.   I would like to say that Sake Rok is a great pregame place to start your night off in Vegas. If you like pun filled drink names, some appetizing sushi and the staff dancing for you, then come here."}
{"text":"Great Place for  a Bachelorette Dinner  We came here Friday night for dinner and we had such a great time. We did a Sake Bomb with the host. We absolutely loved the musical numbers the staff did. On top of that the food was fantastic.  GET THE SAKE ROK EDAMAME!!! It was amazing. So good I could drink the sauce. We also had the shrimp and vegetable tempura that was really good. We ordered about ten different things and loved it all.   This place is great for all ages and is a blast"}
{"text":"We walked into this place looking for sushi and walked out two hours later knowing that we found one of the best hidden jewels of Las Vegas!  The food, the drinks, the entertainment!   AMAZING.  I even learned how to do a sake bomb!  You have to go if in Vegas!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Stopped here for dinner a few weeks ago.  This place has amazing sushi!!!  Also the staff puts on a mini show while your eating.  They dance and sing randomly ... making a fun experience.     The only down side is the food here is expensive.  But given that your in Vegas it's expected.  The only reason for 4 stars is when I was here, I came with a party of 6.  We all paid of bill in full using credit cards/cash.  We had enough to cover the bill and give a pretty big tip. The waiter ran after us after we left thinking we shorted them $5 bucks.  We explained how the bill was broken down and the waiter to seem to understand.  2 mins later...he's running after us again saying it's still off.  (Already running late for a show we gave him $5 bucks not to argue).  Not a big deal...but just annoying considering we left a pretty big tip and had to give another $5."}
{"text":"What a fun place!!!  Great sushi and drink selections. If your looking for a fun way to start your night, this is the place.  All the servers and dancers as well and put on a fun show.  Great atmosphere,  music , and vibe"}
{"text":"This place is SO FUN! The restaurant is so cool and hip, the food is outstanding and the entertainment is THE BOMB! Amanda was our server and she was super attentive, friendly, and fun!   The emcee on Sunday nights is Jeffrey and he is out of this world!! He walks around to the tables, chats, makes you laugh, does sake bombs with you and also sings and dances! He made our whole night OUTSTANDING! We had the best experience here and highly recommend Sake Rok! The entire staff was incredible and just so much fun!!  Oh and get the Godzilla drink! Super good and comes out with a really cool presentation!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but it's all hype. The entertainment and drinks were the best part. There are so many unique drinks made with sake with fun combinations which are well presented. I would totally come here for drinks again but skip the sushi. We had the spicy tuna roll and it was very fishy and not spicy at all. We had the rok  and roll and it was not good at all. The only unique roll was the cucumber maki. It looked pretty and tasted ok but nothing special.     The dj show was fun and super entertaining and the staff dancers were surprising good.  Service was good the food came out fast. Like I said come here for the drinks skip the sushi."}
{"text":"Go here! What a great experience! Amanda, Simon, and Johnny are so amazing! I would definitely be back here again! We ordered the honey toast, the Godzilla, and the Ginja Ninja. Johnny and Simon took the time to talk to us and we felt like they cared. I mean, they didn't have to do that; but it was nice that they took the time to get to know us."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying the food was pretty tasty. However, the service from beginning to end was horrible. I went to have lunch at around 3pm the people at the front told me they had only a few selections available because they were transitioning to dinner. Then the hostess tells me they have the full menu available. That was a little confusing. We go in and sit down at a table (no one told us where to go or to sit) and someone came over and said the tables are closed we can only sit at the bar. After we sat down at the bar, we got the menu and started to browse. Our waiter said they on had the sushi menu open and that we couldn't order anything else. After much back and forth conversations with the manager they finally let us order from the \"hot plate menu\" as well. After we ordered, we over heard one of the chefs saying \"what table ordered the tuna tataki\" in a irritable voice. That's is just horrible fricken customer service. Chefs were standing around on their phone, talking and we were the only ones in there at the time! Our order took at least 30 minutes and let me tell you the portions are NOT worth the price. My first experience here was absolute crap. Staff sucked. They really need to reconfigure their image because they are sloppy as hell right now. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I fell in love the moment I heard about Sake Rok..They all care so much about each customer and eachother. I'm so proud to have been able to say I can be apart of the Sake Rok family. Definitely somewhere everyone has to experience.. 10/10!"}
{"text":"OMG...what an amazing experience! The food is phenomenal. Seriously, not one bad item. We had apps (Brussels sprouts, lime chilis)..rolls (several...loved el chapo)....and the dessert. Oh, the dessert! Orgasmic honey toast. But the food is surpassed only by the awesome and raucous environment. Great energy! Definitely the place to start any fun night out with friends!!"}
{"text":"Went here before a concert. Literally just steps from the t mobile arena. You walk and your assaulted (in a good way) by loud music and flashing lights. They have a crazy host running around with a mic singing and getting patrons to do sake bombs. When you go to some place like this you think the food is going to be sub par - it wasn't. The toro sushi was so good and fresh as was the yellow tail and salmon. The spicy tuna roll wasn't nearly as good as the sushi but still decent. You can imagine that the service was spotty with our waitress breaking to jump into a song and dance - but the management felt so bad that we had to wait so long that they took care of a large part of our drinks. Wouldn't definitely recommend - but it is a party atmosphere so be prepared."}
{"text":"\"When I say sake rok, you say sake bomb!!!!\"   Great for parties, bachelor/bachelorette, team outings etc. Boyfriend and I were here on a Sunday evening around 6:40pm and it was already alive and jamming. Got the emcee startin it off....hypin up the crowds...dancers all around the dining floor, up on the bar tables....definitely entertaining.  We ordered the following items: -shishito peppers -baked crab hand rolls (two hand rolls per order) - baked snow crab, spicy aioli, avocado in soy paper. -tiger roll - shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, spicy tuna, negi, spicy dynamite sauce -kamikaze roll - shrimp tempura, jalapeno, avocado, tuna, jalapeno vinaigrette, eel sauce, lime juice, micro cilantro  This may not seem a lot of food, but it was enough to fill us up. Plus these rolls can start off at $16.00....it can add up...QUICK. The baked crab hand roll was $20.00 and it only came with TWO PIECES. Yikes. For $20, you would think you get more than that. So don't come here if you're on a budget....or if you're starving or else your bill would be like $70.00 PER PERSON. They can charge this much for sushi because A.) they're located on Las Vegas Blvd and B.) the ambiance + entertainment is different than your usual sushi restaurants.   It's fun to check out...but you come here for the experience and entertainment. If you want just a good old normal sushi restaurant without the sticker shock, this won't be for you."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, the staff is great. However, I got terrible, terrible food poisoning from a salmon roll. Just a heads up to the management."}
{"text":"We went to Sake Rok our last night in Vegas and to celebrate a friend's 29th birthday. The atmosphere is super lively and they made sure to acknowledge my friend's birthday in a special way. Shout out to our waiter DJ and all the additional waiters that came over throughout the night! They all provided excellent service!  I would highly recommend this restaurant for a group ages 20-40. They have a dj that played music all night and every hour or so the wait staff broke out in a dance routine. It was very entertaining and fun! We had a group of 7 people. Throughout the evening we ordered round after round of sake bombs $6 a piece (Don't be fooled by the 8 sake bombs for $80). For appetizers, we started with edamame, dumplings and brussel sprouts. The dumplings were good but the brussel sprouts were DELICIOUS! Each person at the table ordered a specialty roll and then we tacked on several of the hand cut rolls. The hand cut rolls were small and nothing extraordinary. Exactly what you would expect. The specialty rolls were very unique! We ordered almost every one on the menu but my favorites were Spicy Samurai (beware very spicy), Tiger Roll, Puff the Magic Dragon (comes with edible white foam on top). Since we had a birthday girl they brought out their signature Honey Toast! It was delicious! We also had the mochi which I thought the shell was too gummy... nothing special. Overall very entertaining/unique dining experience and the price isn't bad either. We had about 6 rounds of sake and most people also ordered a beer + food shook out to about $65 per person + tip."}
{"text":"Came to this place because it had high yelp reviews. The food is decent, the food is pricey but the service was VERY disappointing.  My group was a party of 7 and we called in advanced to make reservations for dinner since we were out celebrating. When we arrived, we were greeted and sat immediately. There were 2 other tables with groups of 2-3 people - Not sure if they had an outside area but those were the only people we saw in the entire restaurant including the upstairs.  As we were settling into our table, a gentlemen came over to ask if we were planning to do any of their 80oz sake bombs; we weren't so he removed the kegs from our table and was never seen again. Once he left we sat there for a good 20 minutes before anyone else tried to talk to us. When someone did come to talk to us, it was one of the restaurant's main entertainer who came by to let us know that there was going to be a show that night before wandering off to the other groups inside the restaurant.  A completely different guy finally took notice and apologized that we hadn't been serviced yet. He had assumed that someone else was already taking care of us. Since no one actually was...he went ahead and started getting us water and taking our food order.   When the food started coming out, the entertainer from earlier was the one bringing our food out. It was very nice of him to do so, but also very odd since it looked like they had 15 other people on staff just standing around and some goofing off with each other (besides the two chefs in front). I assume he (the entertainer) did that because the show he was leading was just about to come on. Once the show began, it looked like the staff didn't want to interrupt him and the performers, so they stood idle with the rest of our orders and began dancing with each other until it was over.   After our food was delivered, there was literally no interaction with the staff. Through out the evening, no one came back to check on us for refills or see if there was anything else that we needed. The restaurant also never got busier from when we got there. We ended up having to flag someone down ourselves to let them know that one of the girls never received her food. We waited so long that the whole group literally finished all of their food and her one item still never came. Because the staff seemed like they were busy talking amongst themselves and ignoring us, we ended up having to walk over to ask them to cancel the item.   Then a girl finally came over to give us a refill on water which was the first for us (and after we had finished our food). We asked her for our check since the other guy who took our order was nowhere to be seen. He did bring our check though and when we reviewed our bill, the restaurant added a 22% gratuity! Now we understand that we are a group of 7 but we've eaten at other restaurants on the strip plenty, and the most we've ever seen was 18%. Asked our waiter about it to see if that was their standard and he seemed less friendly this time - basically said yep and walked away. Seems rather silly considering one of the girls never even ate since they failed to bring her food out and the service was just flat out terrible. We weren't going to make a big fuss over it, but I don't think we will come here again because it was not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I was little disappointed when got my 12 piece omakase because it is really more like a sashimi plate. I was expecting different 12 different pieces of sushi but it was instead 2-3 pieces of 6 different fishes. But my friend ordered the volcano roll and it was delicious. Overall, the atmosphere was awesome and they even put on a little performance for all of us."}
{"text":"I dined here awhile back and have been meaning to get around to writing about this place. I've heard some good things about this place so I had to check it out. First of 5 stars for the environment. It's fun, it's loud, they have great music playing, and the workers there seem to really enjoy their jobs. However, upon arrival we were sat and given a large table sized menu, not complaining it was just different, but then we had to wait awhile before we finally flagged someone down to take our order. A different server finally came and started explaining some of the menu items after we gave our order. And finally a third server came around to us and nearing the end of our meal to check up on us and was super friendly and attentive so kudos to him. Definitely giving the food 5 stars though. Little on pricier side but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Is there a place to click on 10 stars out of 5??!! This was my first time at Sake Rok and it was quite an experience. That's the perfect word for this is an \"experience\". We went this last Saturday night. It was packed and happening. There were 5 of us, but we were able to be seated within 15 mins.    There's so much to look at that you can get easily distracted by what's happening at other tables or at the bar. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, the staff was spectacular. And I mean ALL of 4 staff,  not just our waitress. I don't even know where to start with this review because I have so many great things to say.   We did the \"Sake Flight\" before we ordered, which is basically 5 different types of sake. You start from one end and work your way up to the other end.  My favorite was the last one which tasted like champagne married sake and had a baby. It was great! You need to try this - so much fun!!!  Then we ordered some appetizers - edamame rok, adagashi tofu and the brussel sprouts. All of these dishes were wonderful, but one in particular has my heart. The brussel sprouts are out of this world!!! I know you may frown upon hearing it has fish sauce in it, but let me tell you,  imagine the best brussel sprouts you've ever had,  then amp that up by 10 points - that's how delicious they are!   We were hesitant to order the huge Godzilla platter because being Asian, we did the math and it didn't add up. Their rolls average $20 each.  In the platter there are 5 rolls and 8 pieces of sashimi for $200. If you order 5 rolls it's closer to $100 & 8 pieces of sashimi can not possibly be another  $100. Anyways we said screw it, let's just order it and see what it's about!!!   Money aside, we were really pleased with how the platter was presented. It came attached to this gigantic Godzilla that had steam (dry ice?) coming out of its mouth. I think the extra cost is for the experience. If you're all about the experience, get the platter!! The sushi tasted great as well.   Throughout the night there were performances by the staff. They are REALLY good dancers and performers. They have some moves! There was someone who reminded me of Aerosmith who hosted, went table to table, gave advice on food,  talked to you, made you feel comfortable, made you laugh, took shots with you-all around great person who made the experience even more magical.   At the end of the meal I went to the restroom and was stunned at all the offerings in there. I was a bit off guard bit in a good way. There was a towel lady there, but they had everything under the sun in there - various types of lotion, perfume, candy, mints, deodorant, etc and maybe my memory decides me, but I swear I saw cigarette packs.   It is loud in there, but it's fun. It has a great vibe. If you want to go have a meal and smile the whole time, listen to great music, have some great service, and enjoy yourself, this is the place for you!! Next time I'm in Vegas, I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Reserved here for a friend's birthday. Such a fun crazy vibe. Immediately as we're walking in the staff is starting a boy band montage. It's better than it sounds. There is a host from Canada that is the soul and life of the place. He is so personable and charismatic and fun and really gets the fun rolling. Be sure to engage in the free sake bombs with him. I don't know how he keeps it up all night. The restaurant sang happy birthday to my friend and projected a sign on the wall. Be sure to let them know what you're celebrating and they'll make you feel special. Drinks are strong and delicious. My Kirin frozen head left much to be desired and maybe stick to rolls VS entrées as this is where they truly shine. The rolls are fantastic. Up with the best I've ever had. That honey toast as well. Order one for the table. You won't be able to stop eating it. Thank u sake rok. You made my friends birthday night and we will be back."}
{"text":"The Salmon tempura was really good, the veggie sushi was a disappointment. The place itself is really nice.."}
{"text":"we were at New York New York and happened to search on Yelp \"sushi\" and discovered this FANTASTIC place!  we arrived with a party of 22. got seated within 10 mins.   DEFINITELY come here for a good time, pre-drink before the club, BIRTHDAYS, celebrations or for some bomb ass sushi! more fun for Large parties!!   there was a lot of entertainment going on, sake bombs!!!! and everything else.   service was top notch! plenty of worker and staffs to take care of you. they were so attentive and great! shout out to John and josh!"}
{"text":"We went here on our vacation in April. Amazing sushi!!! We also ordered a punch bowl kind of drink! As recommended by our waitress. Delicious!! Well worth it. The entertainment is also great. We went later in the evening on a weekday and we definitely were not disappointed. We tried 5-6 different types of sushi and all were great! We also had the ice cream ball things. Salted Carmel. Delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sushi and ramen were okay but not for the price. Very slow service and the hot tea was disgusting. I was hoping that I'd get the opportunity to ask if they had a plain green tea but our server never returned to our table to check on us. Don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"FUN - Entertaining - and Hey!  The sushi is very good and the service and ambiance outstanding.  DJ - upbeat sounds and then, WHAT!? a mini show with dancing, humor and more FUN - came here before heading see Cher and what a great pre-show!"}
{"text":"After exploring Vegas for the afternoon, we stopped by for a quick lunch and were seated immediately. The restaurant itself was quite impressive, and the decor was unique. There was a huge projector screen on the wall playing the game, which I thought was cool. The waitress greeted us and handed us gigantic menus! We were interested in trying their sushi and asked what she recommended. We took her suggestion and ordered the Tiger Roll, as well as the Pan Seared Scallops. Both were delicious and the food presentation was definitely aesthetically appealing. The sushi was so good I forgot to take a picture, but here's a picture of the scallops :P"}
{"text":"This is the first time I come here. Really enjoy the music and energy  when we walk in We ordered Hot Stone w Wagyu beef, (4oz for $160)  Rok & roll, Volcano roll and a couple appetizer. Love the beef!! It was very tender and flavorful. And, the service was very good."}
{"text":"6/10   They play music very loud so it has a nightclub atmosphere; however, there is nowhere to dance. If I can't dance with my date I would at least like to be able to hear them.   The staff seem friendly but I only saw them for a few seconds. The menus are ridiculously large for no reason and you have to share them so picking food takes twice as long.   The entertainment included a flamboyant guy and employees dancing to gangnam style for about 2!minutes while wearing shutter shades, the popular style from 2008.  The food was really delicious I just wish I actually had more than a bite. This is the smallest portion in an asian restaurant I've ever had (at least for this price).   The mixed shrimp and vegetable tempura is about $16 and you get 3 pieces of shrimp, 1 carrot, 1 asparagus, and quarter of an onion deep fried. Thats more of an appetizer than a meal.   The pork dumplings were also around $16 and you get 5 small sized dumplings that were slightly larger than a quarter. It tastes good but you finished it in about 5 seconds.   The spicy samurai roll was very delicious but honestly nothing special for such a hefty price once again. Its basically spicy tuna and some eel with avocado inside. Im pretty sure that was close to $20.   All together the bill was over $50 and im hungrier than when I got here."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere! Good food. Like the smaller cut roll options. A place we will come back to!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Been here before and liked the place as well, glad they got rid of those gigantic menus. Best of all is you can charge your food directly to your room if you are staying at an Mlife resort."}
{"text":"High class Sushi bar. They have entertainment and tasty food! And also music that deaf you and high price. But you have to give credits to the beautiful, slow, dancing waitresses, and the McDonalds I went afterwards because I didn't eat enough.  So, in conclusion, the place is lit, but I'm poor. I do like how the place looks."}
{"text":"Saulecker Essen in einer etwas höheren Preisklasse. Dafür aber sterneverdächtig! Sushi Deluxe! Hammer ist auch das Fleisch auf dem heißen Stein! Etwas nervig, aber da stehen die Amerikaner drauf, die Travestieshow mit viel Sing-Sang.  In Ruhe essen ist hier jedenfalls nicht möglich. Wer das aber weiß kommt auf seine Kosten!"}
{"text":"When we first walked in, we were greeted with loud, booming music and synchronized dancing employees. We were quickly seated in the corner of the restaurant with a great view of the dancers and the rest of the customers. I was relieved to be placed away from the dancing employees. They tried to get as many people to dance with them and were super extroverted.  The noise level of this place was similar to going to a night club. If you needed to talk to someone, you pretty much had to speak up really loudly or else the loud noise would drown out your voice.   The menu was a little hard to read. The disco lights kept changing colors. The area we were sitting at would go dark and then become bright after 5 seconds. I had to wait for the room to get bright before making my food selection.   I finally selected the Salmon Avocado Roll ($10) and Tempura Roll ($15). Each roll contained 8 pieces.   The Salmon Avocado Roll had tons of salmon. Some of the salmon pieces I received were 0.5\" x 0.5\" x 0.5\". This place was also not cheap on the avocado pieces. I could actually taste avocado unlike the other sushi restaurants I have been to. The Tempura Roll was great as well! The rice tasted as if it was deep fried. I did not see tempura flakes. It tasted very warm and fresh. The spicy mayo was a little spicier than what I remember.   This place was a little expensive, but the food was great!"}
{"text":"Sake Rok isn't a restaurant. Nor a bar. It's an EXPERIENCE. Come here. Sit back. Eat delicious food. Drink yummy cocktails. And see some of the best free entertainment around. The staff here is awesome. The hosts always keep the party going. Yes, it's pricey. It's Vegas. What do you expect?! But, we feel we always get what we pay for here. Always a great start to an epic Vegas evening"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed  I had been craving sushi all weekend and we seen this spot while walking the strip and it's new so why not try something new right ? Well wrong, I wanted this meal to be our final meal in Vegas and unfortunately the rolls were baby rolls and not very flavorful. I will be honest we did switch up one of the rolls a bit so maybe the original roll would have tasted better but either way it was beyond small I mean tiny !! The chefs have definitely perfected there craft on cutting the thinnest slices possible of avocado and the smallest crab meat put in the roll was less the than the size of my pinky finger and the rolls aren't cheap so you aren't paying for presentation because they come on a plain white serving tray and you aren't paying for quantity because they are so small so I could only assume your paying for the show that comes with the meal which we didn't get because we missed it by an hour and came too early. So I suggest coming when there is a show so you will at least get some entertainment. And please please please order your drink with no ice !! Because we paid $14 for a cup of ice with a flower and the taste was ok nothing spectacular! And the roll that we did change we still wanted shrimp just not spicy shrimp we mentioned possibly changing it to crap but opted not to and I guess the waiter didn't hear us because he still ordered it with crab and it was $5 more for something we didn't want  I'm not sure if the dj music was to loud and he didn't hear us or wasn't paying attention but either way paying more for something you don't want that didn't have the best of flavor was a true disappointment. The overall atmosphere of the place was nice with a decent amount of seating . It did take a while for the roll and the place wasn't packed at all so I'm not sure if they waited to make the rolls because someone in our party ordered the hanger steak and takes a while to make or they just take a long time to make the rolls because the have to prefect the art of making mini rolls lol either way not happy, make your own judgement and hopefully my tips will help you have a better experience! The hanger steak I was told that was delicious and that's what the stars are for. Maybe my review wouldn't have been so harsh if I seen the value in what we were buying but since there was no show and small amount of food it only lead to disappointment I wouldn't suggest that they offer free edamame or miso soup or for them to lower the prices to pre event meals ."}
{"text":"Best place for sushi & a show in Vegas HANDS DOWN! I wouldn't recommend any other place besides here. Great music & the host is VERY entertaining as well as the servers/waitresses. Loved the drinks as well! This is a must visit when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was so fun! I've never been to such a vibrant sushi spot. The food was delicious! I will be going back."}
{"text":"Disappointing during the day. I could see the place raging at night and being a completely different experience.  But since I had lunch there, I will review honestly. At least 3 members of the waitstaff were too hungover to give a shit and the bartender couldn't figure out how to pour a Sapporo, an IPA, or ANYTHING (but, sweet! I saved a Hamilton). I was charged for the beers and had to have the bill corrected.  The rolls & soup were just fine. It had the 2x price increase that you get on the Las Vegas strip.  Recommendation: Cancel lunch OR offer lunch specials at a reasonable price with a waitstaff that knows how to work at the early hour of 12:30."}
{"text":"Sake Rok is amazing! The food is great, the service is terrific, and the entertainment is spectacular! I recommend going to Annahita at the bar! Ceasar & Johnas are amazing performers! They give you a great show every time! The rolls are delicious! I'll be conning back for sure! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Great interior wall paintings, but the food was just ok. We were expecting mind blowing sushi, I guess the pricing had a lot to do with that aspect. Each roll being at least $16, we were highly disappointed when the first roll we tried fell apart before it even got off the plate. We ordered the volcano roll (which fell apart), tiger roll, and the dos chi-charrones. The dos chi-charrones was the only unique roll, as it was like a burrito roll. 2 of the rolls (tiger and volcano) were the highly popular ones as well, marked in red on the menu.  Staff were friendly and the place was clean. I think this would be a great place for a late night lounge place ad they had the lights and the projector as well as a dj booth.  Unfortunately, we aren't able to check it out."}
{"text":"We came to Sake Rok for appetizers after our massages since we planned to have dinner somewhere else later in the evening. For rolls, we chose Puff the magic dragon and the Volcano. The volcano roll is baked and has the perfect amount of spiciness. The puff the Magic Dragon roll has suds (?) on the top. Don't worry. Whatever it is, it's edible and doesn't have a flavor. We also had the shrimp and vegetable tempura. I had the Dragonfly cocktail and enjoyed it a lot, but something in it made my lips tingle. The server brought over the alcohols used in the drink, but we were unable to determine what it was that caused the tingling. Also, about every 30 to 45 minutes, the staff puts on a performance/show with the staff dancing and singing and running around the restaurant so be prepared for that. If you want a laid back, intimate vibe where you can have conversation, this restaurant is too energetic and hype for you."}
{"text":"Vincent killed it! Always on top of our experience but never invasive. Thank you for treating my company to amazing evening. These locals were happy campers"}
{"text":"Loved it. Sushi amazing! Staff amazing! The random acts of breaking into dance mode - AMAZING"}
{"text":"Don't recall a dinner experience as welcoming, delicious, entertaining, and genuinely enjoyable.  A place where when the bill for $$$ arrives, one thinks 'easy, let's do this again soon!'"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a night out with friends. Great food and entertainment! I recommend setting a price point and doing a chefs choice for the meal.   The sushi, the beef, the scallops and of course the Sake bombs make for an incredible night.   Plan for a couple hours and sit back and enjoy. What a great addition to the Vegas strip!"}
{"text":"If you have a bachelor/bachelorette/divorce/birthday/etc. party...or have friends that might otherwise be boring after 10 mins of catching up...or if you just happen to be in Vegas...Sake Rok is the place for you...heck, even If you need a place to let some co-workers release and unwind, Sake Rok is a lot of fun with a group of friends.  Nine of us met up here the other night due to the wonderful organizing of Cathey K! Once you enter Sake Rok, you can feel the high energy...an energy created by not only the wall decor and lighting, but more importantly, by the talented staff and specifically, the host. The host on this evening was wearing lots of makeup, with a skimpy Mick Jagger-like wardrobe. And throughout the evening, he was continuously interacting with the audience/patrons, thoroughly engaging, while demonstrating his true gift--singing, dancing,  pleasing, and imploring bottoms-up Sake bombs as fast as anyone in the restaurant...he could make a sake-bomb fan out of a monk if given the chance. Throughout all our dinner, he was entrancing, leaving many of us enamored with the group dances and general uplifting vibe of the floor.    And about the food: -Chef selection 40 piece Sashimi Platter -Amber Jack Nigiri -Uni Nigiri -Sashimi Tacos -Berkshire Pork Dumplings -Soba Noodles -Honey Toast Boat...the biggest one you will ever see  All their Nigiri courses came with one piece...I enjoyed the Uni Nigiri very much with its fresh ocean flavor. The dumplings were very flavorful, though rather small. The honey toast came with some great macaroons in a variety of flavors, while the boat itself was so delightful that I literally tore that boat in to pieces...yummy. My love enjoyed the Soba noodles very much, but the noodles were too al dente for my liking.  The service the staff provided us was 3 dimensional...There was the typical service you would get at a restaurant, plus entertainment by not only the super-energized and talented MC, but also by all the wait staff...at some points, even the chefs were dancing to the beat!  I will definitely come back with a group of friends...and you may even catch me up on stage with them dancing along to the party!  - 2017 Review #44 -"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was very disappointing. The food was OK, the service was awful. We like good sushi and fun spots but will never be back."}
{"text":"Entertainment factor earns this place 5! Especially when the host and staff do the Backstreet Boys & n'sync battle! They also were knowledgeable with gluten free and had gf soy sauce, which is always nice. Menu wasn't overwhelmingly huge either, which in my opinion is a plus. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and the whole staff are very friendly and welcoming. The ambiance is great as well! Most specially the Sous Chef Michael Kato. He's very exceptional chef. And the quality of food is exquisite. So much fun and will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"How is this place even real?!! We actually had plans to visit BeerHause next door but decided to come here since we didn't receive any service after sitting for 10mins.  They were busy and it took a while for our waiter to come by. We were actually going to walk out again but noticed they were busy with a huge party. I'm sad I didn't get his name but he was the entertainer with long wavy hair. He was magic! Eventually the server did get to us and the rest of the staff were extremely nice and attentive. I loved the little performances they put on and I thought the quality was high for their sushi rolls. Of all the places I've visited on my trip, this one definitely stuck out the most and can't wait to come back and visit."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here. Made a 5:30 reservation, they sat us down, and no one talked to us for 40 minutes. It wasn't even busy yet. The people next to us had the manager come to complain because they had the same problem, and the manager didn't even look at us. This place thinks they are too cool for school. The only cool thing was the drag queen entertainer who resembled Buffalo Bill from the Silence of the Lambs. We walked over to Morimotos at MGM, and were treated like royalty. The sushi. was. amazing over there. Same prices too. Skip this place if you don't relish feeling invisible or giving your money to an establishment who doesn't care about their guests."}
{"text":"We stopped by at this restaurant for a quick,  late lunch. We were seated immediately--there was only one other table seated at the time.   The restaurant is insanely cool. I love the industrial decor and the art work. The wait staff were very nice and really helpful. So right off the bat I was really happy with having chosen this place for lunch.   I started with a cocktail--the Dragonfly. Freakin' delicious! I highly recommend it. Then I had the Tiger roll...also insanely good. I would have ordered more food, but I was still quite full-ish from breakfast.   An incredibly awsome spot!"}
{"text":"Perfect Monday night Vegas. They made feel like the weekend still !!! The foods was delicious!! I fell like I am in Japan agin!!! They made our trip must alive"}
{"text":"Looking for a great value sushi spot in Vegas? I'd recommend Sake Rok. High quality sushi rolls at decent prices. I went with my two best friends before a Cirque show - I wasn't expecting to get entertainment at Sake Rok too. The wait staff did a brief performance / fun dance - they were quite talented. Very pleasant surprise! They also gave us free sake bombs for my friends bday."}
{"text":"Annahita and Johnas were so awesome!! So friendly and We had so much fun taking sake bombs and eating and listening to music! They love locals here! Great service! =)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing fun.  I can't wait to come back here. It is my new Vegas destination. I love it."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, but I was totally let down. First off, got a pitcher of sangria for $50 that was well overpriced. Next ordered about $120 worth of sushi and was so small I fit it all in one frame. Their sushi orders are only one piece instead of 2. It honestly wasn't that good. Kinda bland. I will totally tell people to avoid this Disneyland style price rape."}
{"text":"It's a great sushi place. I'll definitely be coming back in my next visit. It's a place you should try at least once."}
{"text":"We, my daughter and wife we're going to the Queen concert, at the T Mobile, looking for a place to eat we came across the Sake Rok.  The food Japanese fusion, was better than we expected, wife is Japanese so she is very conscious about the so called \" Non Japanese \" sushi. Not even sure one way or the other because the food was outstanding.it was amazing, and the wait staff beyond reproach as they double as entertainers. Great stop we will be back."}
{"text":"Had no idea what I was walking into! Walked into a restaurant filled with guests sitting/standing in awe at the singing geisha and performing servers! The atmosphere was definitely a mix of east coast meets west coast. I got the vibe of a New York bar but the comfort of the West. If the owners were looking at a way to spark curiosity...they definitely nailed it! But not only that...the food! THE FOOD! I really don't know what other people tried but everything that I ate was so amazing! I love trying new foods and you'll know when I don't like something....and I LOVED everything!  Must try... Edamame Rok Hamachi Sashimi Shishito Peppers The hanger steak El Chapo Roll ...idk what other roll I had but it was delicious!   Everything was delicious! Try for yourself and be your own judge! I love this kind of food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. The food is always amazing, I would recommend the volcano roll. The host were very friendly and so were the servers. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary, we are not the stuffy type. In fact we just like to go out and have fun and I think we picked the best place to celebrate. You walk in and are greeted by two hostess in sleek dresses,smiling and ready to seat you. There is a short wait so my beau and I head to the bar for a drink. The male bartender hands us the ridiculously big menu ( I think there should be a separate cocktail menu ) I order the Hana berri cocktail which is sake and sparkling sake and something else the drink was ok not anywhere in my top 10. The beau orders a tall Japanese beer, I should have ordered that instead. We get sat next to a two top table by the sushi bar. Perfect seating to see everything! When I say everything I'm talking about the performance, the waiters, and food runners coming out of the kitchen, and the tall male manager talking into an ear piece and putting his hand very low on the hostess back who looked like she needed to ask something (awkward) I felt that was inappropriate. I'm not a prude but it made me feel like I saw something I shouldn't have seen. Anyways our server comes over younger thin guy I think named Eric and he begins his spiel he is knowledgable of the menu and gave us superb service! Even though the place was busy he did a great job of recommending food. After he takes our order another server comes up Named DJ and he begins to do a spiel. We let him know Eric already took our order and the face DJ flashed was kind of an annoyance. My only suggestion would be for the team to have more communication going on. Other than that the food was good top choices are the pork belly seaweed salad and any specialty rolls. Food was great performance was fun and service was good."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out based on the reviews, but I was very disappointed. The hostess who greeted us was friendly, but went downhill after that. So the ambience is very Vegas, there was a host dressed as a rocker geisha entertaining some of the guests which I thought was kinda cool, what turned me off in this place is lack of service and communication. We came in, got seated and were given water. After about 10 minutes, no one came to take our order. To add insult to injury, the host asked us if he can borrow our chair to take a picture with the table of guys next to us. I normally won't mind that, but even after that and seeing that we still have our menus in front of us and having no food on our table, we still did not get any server to take our order!!! We waited 5 more minutes and nothing! My husband and I just decided to leave and walk into NYNY hotel and had amazing service from another restaurant inside."}
{"text":"Everything was great! We came in for a light early dinner but ended up so so full. Honey toast and ramen are dreamy. Salmon sashimi is a little pricey but worth it. Rolls are very legit too. Would love to come back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing and plays the best music! My friends and I just stopped in to get a drink and ended up staying for 3 hours because we were having so much fun. Plus the food and drinks are amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! My first time here and we were here for dinner. They had a dance show and play all the Backstreet Boys and N'sync songs for our entertainment. This place is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want a good time!! If you really want a Vegas experience! Loud and fun entertainment, great drinks, and yummy Japanese fusion cuisine! Great for large groups, bachelorette parties, and birthday."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant was beyond amazing!!!! My girls planned our dinner here for my Bachelorette and I couldn't be happier! I ordered the Tiger Roll which was amazing and on the spicy side! If you don't do spicy do not get this roll! I also got a side of miso soup and shrimp tempura and it was yummy! They also had a Blueberry sake and it was delicious! I believe it was called Banzai Bunny Blueberry Sparkling Sake, it is a much try! Not only did they have great food and drinks, the atmosphere was so fun! It is basically a live performance while you eat! That night I was happy they sang great 90's hits like Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. Their dancing was awesome too! I had so much fun dancing, eating, and being with my girls. All the staff were fun, friendly, and super helpful. I for sure want to come back! One of the best sushi experiences in my life."}
{"text":"Sake Rok is awesome! I really have to get down here more to \"THE PARK\" area because they really do have some fantastic places to dine and drink at. So I came here to celebrate one of my best friends Candy R for her birthday. You ever have those moments where it like not planned where you want to eat and you just spontaneously come up with somewhere to celebrate at the last minute? Yeah.. that's exactly what happened and how we ended up here. This place is a bit hidden as I had to call and ask them exactly where they were located. When I walked across the street I just had to look and see the sign.. silly me. But no they are low key ducked off. Next to California Pizza kitchen I finally found them!   When we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server who ended up actually being somebody who performs in the live shows that they do. Kind of cool right it was funny watching her take our orders and then run to go do all this dancing on the stage. Multi-tasker much? Yes.. That was pretty dope to say the least. The service here was actually pretty damn good because of all the attention you get and the fact that they really do a good job insisting that you have a great time. My best friend let the MC Drag Queen know that it was her birthday and she did a wonderful job making sure that it was actually celebrated. They even went a step above by putting her name on the projector camera in big letters wishing her a Happy Birthday.   The food and drinks were okay here...actually the only reason I didn't give them 3 stars was because of the service. Balanced out. I wasn't extremely hungry so I went with the wagyu beef sliders. They were okay and my friends ordered a bunch of other items. We all just shared each others plates because well sharing is caring right? RIGHT! The best dish of them all probably had to be the pork chop dish. I'm not huge on pork and only eat it every blue moon. One of our friends is vegan so she had a separate menu to order off of. The tofu dish that she ordered was a bit bland and it was just missing something... The prices here are high but expected because you are on the strip.  Bottom line is if you are up for a place that you can eat and enjoy some interesting entertainment then this is your place. If you love Sake Bombs then you will have a blast here because they do these random times throughout the night where they have people order Sake Bombs and chug them in sync... Follow those Sake bombs by Backstreet Boys and super loud music.. Have fun!"}
{"text":"When we arrived we expected to have a regular sushi dinner....what a surprise! We arrived and were immediately seated on a Friday night. The waitress team offered water as soon as we seat down.  As a table of three we ordered the volcano roll, the tiger roll another roll (I can't remember) and 3 saki bombs.  The way they have you enjoy the saki bombs is unique and fun.  At one point the MC came and offered us  saki bombs on him. It was great-yes the restaurant has a MC.  What was also great was the show- the staff, the waiters, waitresses, sushi chef, and MC, put on an amazing choreograph performance for guest of several songs  By fave artistes of all time-our performance was Backstreet Boys favs-loved it!!! The sushi was amazing and I ordered the hunger steak medium done- it was delicious, like butter. I would come back here a million times over.  Five stars"}
{"text":"WOW!!! what a fun time! My mom and I stopped here before our Diva show and had an amazing time. The food was great, service friendly, and the entertainment spot on! Not your average sushi joint!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a long day of shopping and walking around. We wanted a light lunch and this was perfect. The miso soup, rolls and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"A group of us came to eat here a few times, but I didn't want to review it until I knew for sure that this place was as good as the first time we came when they opened. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I was wrong... It's better!!! The fun atmosphere, amazing food, and not to mention that bomb honey toast!!!! I didn't think I could find honey toast better than Ichiza, but this place completely hits it out of the ballpark! Perfectly sweet and melts in your mouth! The fresh fruit complements it completely! Wish I could give this place 10 stars - 5 just for their honey toast and 5 for their fresh fish, tasty dishes, sake bombs, and great service!!! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came by last week at  night to have a couple drinks and some sushi. Little did we know we were in for a night full of fun and amazing food! Our waitress (who I believe was training) was not only knowledgeable but also full of energy.  She gave some amazing suggestions ( Omasake sashimi and Dragonfly cocktail) which were both so delicious! Jenny, our waitress even got me to get up and dance to Lady Gaga! Which was something I was not expecting to do that night but so glad I did! She and the other staff made the night memorable for myself and my friends! I'm already looking forward to my next trip to Vegas so I can eat/dance there again!"}
{"text":"Sake Rok is a good time! It's basically dinner AND a show! There's a live DJ and loud music, so you are automatically put into a party mood and environment! All the food was delicious, but I was a little disappointed with the service. We ordered edamame, which was listed as a starter and is typically served before sushi, but we did not get it until the end of the meal after reminding our waitress. Although we were just a table of two, and didn't have the biggest bill, it was apparent that our waitress was catering to those with a larger bill and didn't check-in throughout the meal unless we flagged her down for refills on water or to check on our food. All of that being said, Sake Rok was a great and fun way to kickstart our Saturday night and Vegas, but the service does leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"We had a great time here! Tried the Volcano, El Chapo, and Girl on the Beach rolls and they were all excellent! Very fun atmosphere with the staff performing dance routines. I would have given five stars, but the service was definitely lacking and it wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"I visited Sake Rok with my best friend on 12/26/17. We ordered salt and pepper shrimp, cocktails shrimp nigiri, the tiger roll and HONEY TOAST! Each item was delicious! The sushi was fresh and flavorful and the honey toast was so different and I loved it. The servers were attentive, made great suggestions and were kind. This is a pricy restaurant but definitely worth it for special occasions."}
{"text":"Super fun restaurant! Its the perfect spot for celebrations and special occasions. The service was super attentive but not pushy at all. They offer a lot of non sushi options for sushi haters like myself. Hanger Steak was super tender and flavorful but a bit on the smaller side. Girlfriend had the Pan Seared Scallops and those were probably the best scallops I've ever had. We ended with the Honey Toast and this is A MUST HAVE! It was the perfect end to our meal and I definitely recommend this."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Good vibes are everywhere and the food is amazing. There was never a dull moment while dining here."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch the Golden Knights games.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a place to eat some good food have a good drink and to watch the game!!!!"}
{"text":"I really didn't understand much of the hype on Yelp after dining here. We ordered an edamame and seaweed salad to start, which is pretty much the same anywhere. Next, we ordered some sashimi pieces and two rolls: the Rok & Roll and Puff the Magic Dragon. Rok & Roll is a riceless roll, wrapped in cucumber. It's the restaurant's speciality roll. Honestly wasn't that special. Maybe if you like crab in your rolls you'll like it, but it really wasn't that great. Puff was a little better. I subbed out the crab after tasting it in the other roll and got salmon instead. Tasted much better. The sashimi was pretty good (1 order = 1 piece) but the yellowtail didn't taste as buttery as it should."}
{"text":"Overpriced, sashimi quality was ok but the sushi was terrible. First, the rice was so hard and dry and the portion is small and taste weird. Don't understand why this place is 4 stars."}
{"text":"If you want a nice, intimate sushi dinner - don't come to Sake Rok. When we went to Sake Rok for dinner on a Friday night, the music was blasting and there was an MC dressed in drag and singing and dancing to 90's pop hits around the tables, engaging the crowd. It was certainly fun and we loved singing along.  The prices are pretty mediocre - I didn't feel as robbed as I would have thought dining on the strip. We ordered the Japanese Wagu Sliders to start. Oh. My. God. I wish I had ordered one on my own so that I didn't have to share. The beef was truly delicate, tender and juicy and the truffle aioli granted me the power to see the face of God.  The sushi on the other hand, I found to be sub-par. To be fair, I lost the ordering game on this one because I tried my friends' rolls and theirs were all better than mine (I don't even remember the name of the roll I ordered) but none of them were very good. I didn't find them to be very fresh and I thought the rice was a little too tough. The only reason I'm giving this SUSHI restaurant 3 instead of 4 stars is because of the beef sliders and the super fun singing and dancing... counter-intuitive. I know."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal at Sake Rok.  Both the wife and I had the all you can eat Rok AYCE and the all you can drink Kirin and Sake.  There are limitations on how much you can order at one time, however even if you order the max one time, it is a better financial deal than if you paid for each item individually.  The sushi was fresh and in large quantities.   BJ was a great server and very knowledgeable and attentive.  Couldn't recommend more."}
{"text":"If you're wanting a show with dinner this is the place to go! Great traditional Japanese food and a fun musical ambiance to go with it ! You can get up and dance ! Will definitely come back again !"}
{"text":"Booked New Year's Eve dinner at Sake Rok via Open Table.  Had no expectations other than looking forward to a chill night on The Strip and to have a great time with music and fun.  O.T. Genasis was performing and that's what we were here for.  Was a good idea to arrive without expectations or I would not have been surprised.  This restaurant gave many WOW factors as to the look, the feel, the performers who were also our servers, the food presentation, the sushi and sashimi FLAVORS, the prices hahahaaa, and DJ for the event.  But it was New Year's; why not spoil myself and Ness.    Being a holiday occasion, we got their special 5 course menu.  After salad, appetizers, edamame munchies, sushi, sashimi, and the ever so delish main course with Cod - we were feeling it... FULL.  The cod was very nice.  Had a sweetness and a crunch to the top layer.  There was also a mushroom dish with rice that totally tasted like adobo.  Their edamame SO GOOD had seasoning and lime.  We loved their sushi and sashimi, especially the one on a radish slice!  They offered a $50 unlimited well drinks special during the dinner hours.  Wristbands were given.  And this cost made sense, as from the outside bar, one drink is $20.  Bring on the vodka!    The bonus in dining here is there are daily performances by the servers.  This was the biggest plus besides the amazing food and wall art.  Note that the bill reflects a minimum 20% gratuity.  I'm guessing it's because of the show included in the dining experience - understandable.  While we were here, large group tables did Sake Bombs with the main host performer.  Hilarious guy, very entertaining.  Props out to our server Amanda too!  You go ladybug!  And to the other ladies and gents who filled in clearing out empty dishes and offering the next round of drinks.  Yay points!  The interior of this place is pretty awesome!  Props to the artist(s).  The main dining room was transformed into a dance floor.  Second floor was set up for bottle service sections.  And I learned there's a 3rd floor rooftop.  Definitely designed for fun happenings.  Here's to looking at a bright 2017 with tremendous possibilities ahead!!!"}
{"text":"The staff are...happy!  The attire ranged from flannel to t-shirts to Japanese chef.  Bizzare but it seems to be a role distinguisher.  Customer Service here should be benchmarked.  At least 6 people served me from sit down through bill pay.  They were so fast it scared me.  I noticed the double sided chopsticks which could be useful to food separators.   The seaweed salad is unique in a good way. The sushi rolls fresh and yummy.  The staff break out in song and dance.  The music is pop from country to club.  A must stop in.  Fun and caring.  They made me happy."}
{"text":"Sake Rok is a newer restaurant in Vegas that is close to Shake Shack. I personally thought the food was a bit over priced, but still decent. We had shrimp for appetizers and then had sushi rolls (Volcano Roll, Cucumber Maki (veggie), and the Colorful Roll (asked to make it veggie). They were accommodating of the fact that my wife is a vegetarian and, she really enjoyed the rolls she had.  This is a trendy, hipster place to enjoy a meal. We went around 5pm, and it was starting to get crowded, and the one downside was that there was just 1 waiter to take everyones orders. But, they were still very quick and had great service.  Overall, I think the food was really good, and if I am in Vegas again and crave Japanese food, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Rok ramen some of the best I've tasted. Their classic rolls are good too. Fresh and tasty. Staff are friendly too."}
{"text":"Sushi was awesome! The drinks were top notch! My husband and I and our best friends ordered the Godzilla platter. The show was amazing! MC, John, is phenomenal with all the tables. He made our night. He has such a fun personality I didn't want to leave, it felt like we were hanging out with good friends. We had so much fun celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary here. The dancing by all the servers was so fun to watch! I loved my night at Sake Rok and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed this place.  Kind of an upscale version of Tokyo Delves in LA.  Take a moment to say hello to AMY who is in charge of the \"entertainment\". She is a player/coach and quite talented.  The food was fantastic - you HAVE to have the salt & pepper shrimp.  Really the sashimi was good and every appetizer that we had on BOTH of our visits.  Over one long weekend we enjoyed it enough that we went back for seconds.  Very entertaining with the \"floor show\" and all of the servers were SUPER friendly and took great care, while also having and sharing great fun.  Highly suggest you visit!"}
{"text":"This is a super fun place, thanks to the charismatic host. Wait staff serve as dancers, too. Very talented. Food and tasted good, but the prices are quite high. We would visit again if we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. Every waiter asked if we needed refills and if the food was to our liking. Fun samurai guy with long black hair"}
{"text":"Checking out what's Hot & New in Las Vegas, we ended up at Sake Rok for lunch.  The place was nearly empty, but the décor was visually pleasing.  I found the oversized menus to be very gimmicky and ridiculous to use. We settled on a combination of rolls and a veggie tempura appetizer.  The tempura was delicious with a crunchy mix of veggies fried to perfetion. The yellowtail jalapeño roll was disappointing, but the El Chapo roll with spicy crab, shrimp and tomatillo was good.  Probably the best roll out of the bunch was the Tiger.  This place might be better to visit at night after a few drinks and a more lively crowd."}
{"text":"This review goes above and far beyond just great food. First off it was my first time eating Sushi and I was impressed of the taste of the food we ate. The atmosphere was awesome, they had some Nsync and Backstreet Boys dance choreography going on which was great and they definitely kept their guests entertained. We had some delicious shrimp rolls and some other tasty stuff, all of which were great tasting.  So my friend and I were eating there before the concert next door and she had a little tiny purse on her, well when west odd up to leave, a 100.00 bill dropped out of her purse, hit the floor and we left (having no idea).  Well it turns out that our waiter (Keoki) thought he recalled seeing the 100.00 drop out of the purse and went over to grab it, well a guest saw it too and the guest took it themselves. Then the GM got involved and they looked at camera tape and did in fact see that my friend  dropped it, so they requested the guest give it back to them, so they did. They then contacted us via text letting her know what happened. BLOWN AWAY!!!!!!!! This kind of honesty is so hard to find nowadays! Hats off to you Sake Rok!!!!! After the concert was over we went back and she just said to keep the 100.00 because honesty like that is SO hard to find. What an awesome place and still just mind blown by that honest act!"}
{"text":"The establishment was very quick to reach out and contact me about this matter.  Not only was I happy with the resolution,  the prompt response and action  let me know that the restaurant really does care about their patrons and pays attention to correct things that are not in their values.  As I had attended the establishment for a special event,  I will definitely be back during normal business hours to enjoy the ambiance and fine dining.  If the service Mr.  Albert Mack provided is half as good as the customer service that has already been provided,  it will be amazing.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to visit. Side note: I don't do much endorsing.  . Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a casual sushi place. We were in between lunch and dinner so not many places were open. Our concierge recommended this place and it was highly rated on Yelp too. It's located in The Park, which is in between New York New York and T-mobile arena.   The inside of the restaurant reminded me of NYC. Murals were painted on what looked like brick walls. There was a staircase that was reminiscent of fire escapes in NYC.   We ordered the El Chapo roll, the kamikaze roll, and a himachi and jalapeño roll. I have to admit the food took a long time to come out. I don't know how they would accommodate tables at peak dining times. I loved the El Chapo roll. It had a tiny slice of lemon on top of the roll, which offered a fresh taste. My husband liked the kamikaze roll the best. The himachi and jalapeño was great too. I loved the spice on it.   I've heard the dinner experience can be a lot of fun. A table near us was doing sake bombs. A video of other antics was playing on the wall. It's seems like a fun group experience."}
{"text":"We had an event at Sakura Terrace, the event space on the third floor of Sake Rok. The food was served buffet style and was remarkably unimaginative and not memorable at all. The elections included bland greens, salmon, steak, and chicken. All reminded me of a typical already prepared meal from a food store. The appetizers in the beginning were solid with veggie spring rolls, chicken teriyaki, and some sushi. I'm guessing these items were off the main menu as they were much better while the buffet dinner was not. The bartenders were good and always attentive to refills which was nice and he sake on draft was very good considering. The venue itself is nice with a large balcony complete with heat lamps and tables. The venue itself is very nice, but the meal was a let down. Maybe our event orders the wrong dishes, but overall I was not very impressed."}
{"text":"We walked out without ordering. We sat down and were offered different kinds of sparkling water or \"house\" water. We opted for the house water and it smelled and tasted terrible. We've had tap water everywhere else in Vegas and none of it tasted bad like that. We were turned off from eating there based on that and the high sushi prices."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Vegas and I picked this place really craving sushi that day. I went with friends for a late Sunday brunch. There were hardly any guests in the restaurant when we arrived around 2:30pm. Literally, we were one of two tables seated when we first arrived. The wait staff was extremely nice and attentive. The MC for the day was especially funny and simply exuded everything I imagined was Vegas. The dance numbers the staff performed were fun. We joined them in dancing and of course did a sake bomb with the MC! I ordered two rolls, and one was absolutely delicious while the other had a bad taste and it was clear the fish was not fresh. I eventually had to tell the waiter and return the food. The staff did everything to make it up to me, comping the bad roll and even serving us dessert on the house. I truly appreciate their efforts to make it up to me, but unfortunately I was sick with diarrhea for the next few days afterwards. I think it's the first time I've ever had food poisoning at a restaurant and despite the top notch service, it couldn't make up for the awful runs . :("}
{"text":"I just want to note that I am all about eating quality sushi. I have been to many sushi places  and I know when the sushi is worth the money. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The presentation of the sushi is clean and organized but the quality of taste was not there.   We ordered the Godzilla and  10 orders of sake nigiri and 10 order of shrimp nigiri. I was disappointed. It was not fresh enough for my taste and not good enough for the money I spent there. The fresh sushi was flavorless and the rolls did not have a correct balance of flavor.   If you guys are big sushi fans and know the difference between great sushi, good sushi and poor sushi, then this is place in not for you. But if you do like spending $5 on one piece of Nigiri/sashimi (not even a set of two) cause you won big in the casino or something, then be my guest."}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi option to 4:00 pm on weekdays is pretty legit. They have some great rolls and starters, including the gyoza and edamame of course. It's also right by the T-Mobile stadium so there is plenty going on in the area. One heads up, they don't offer the all you can eat during an event at the stadium, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Food is great, workers are on point and very nice and friendly!!! I would definitely come back again and highly recommend this placethis place is soooo much fun! I love it"}
{"text":"Terrible. I ordered the 12 piece Omakase for $44 but got the $55 Omakase.  The service was average at best. The brought out the sushi and didn't even tell me what was on the plate.  As you can see from the photo, the tuna and salmon?   Quality of the sushi was average.  I went on a Sunday night and they were not busy. They had a 90s night music and MC.   If you're looking for something unique or exceptional sushi, this is not the place."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun and the food was great too. The Edamame ROK and Shishito Peppers were excellent and unique. Crispy Rice was good but a bit bland after those appetizers. Tiger Roll and the special Wagyu roll were great.   I really like the idea of this place as they try to entertain with the wait staff doubling as dancers and an MC/host. We ate a bit early on a Thursday night so it wasn't overly lively yet but we could see the potential. We went with it and did some sake bombs and chatted up the host who was very nice. We will definitely come back and recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite and drinks with friends. All the servers break out in dance every 20 min. There's also a host that keeps the dinner lively and pulls people up to dance with the servers. DJ played great music, giving the place a loungey vibe.   We ordered the Hana Berri and Dragonfly Cocktails. Both were yummy! We also shared the edamame, ceviche, and the El Chappo roll. All were light and tasty. Our server was excellent. The Sake bombs were going off all over the restaurant so we had to try it. So much fun, we had two rounds. Sake Rok is a unique dining experience and just what Vegas needs! Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't even know where to start.  This place was amazing!!  I had no idea the staff were performers as well and this made the experience so much fun!!  The food was great and the service was incredible!!  Best service I have had in a very very long time.  If you have a group of people be sure to do the sake bombs along with the host.  I will recommend this place to all my friends visiting Vegas.  Thank you guys for a great time."}
{"text":"The best damn place ever! First time in Vegas, and they didn't let us down! And they had amazing performers!! Will come again the next time we are traveling to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Place has a very cool inside.  It is very gimicky.  The sushi is average at best.  This is a place you go go for rolls. I wasn't impressed with the small cuts of sashimi.  They also put on some pretty average shows. The highlight of the night is the sake bomb."}
{"text":"Amazing at every level, service ,food, entertainment. We had the best time celebrating our daughter 21st birthday. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"OMG! Again, I relied on Yelpers in selecting Sake Rok. Those Yelper's who said the music was loud just made it more intriguing for me. Wonderful rustic atmosphere located in The Park between off Las Vegs Blvd.Jessica at front desk gave me directions there -- twice. You'll have a bit of a walk to get there, because its by NYNY and Shake Shack. 3 levels although I didn't go to 3. I think its for people who want quiet (I dont know for sure). Walking in I didnt see people w/food, so assumed service was slow. Just the opposite; service was fast, but people hung around drinking.  Amanda was my server. Very pleasant and attentive. I had the ginger cosmo and LIT (long-island tea) Great!.  Had edaname and shrimp apps. Chose the ElChopo roll. All very good. Perhaps the best part was the high-energy music  (Prince, MJ, etc.) There is a DJ and a lead 'hype man' who works the room messing w/folks, wishing happy b-day, etc. The staff does synchronized dances every 15 minutes or so. Very entertaining! The red-head young-looking owner who informed me they had only been open a few months. I suggested he come to Milwaukee."}
{"text":"Such a great vibe and an entertaining experience! The service was pretty terrible i'm sure because the entertainers are the waitstaff as well. The menu and  the food were both average. I have to say typically I just order simple sushi rolls but there were a lot of options. If the restaurant did not have any performers the restaurant would be only 1 star in my opinion."}
{"text":"I found this place to be overpriced and under serviced. The sushi was ok but pricey for what you get. I think this place should be marked $$$. The service was pretty rough. BUT they did fit us in at 5:30p on a Saturday with no reservation so that was nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated a wedding anniversary here. Excellent food, superior service, and scintillating performances. Highly recommend for an enjoyable and memorable experience."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and sushi love the servers and management every single person had a smile on there face !"}
{"text":"Absolutely delish.  They had a fantastic Drag Queen MC that put the evenings entertainment over the top.  We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Never again! I went here thinking that this place had to be good since it's located in the Park. The service was horrible! We walked in and only 2 tables were taken but it took them awhile to find us a table. I don't understand that part. Once we sat down, it took about 10 mins for someone to acknowledge us to even give us a menu or water. They had a table of gentlemen that everyone was attending and entertaining (I believe they were distributors)...big mistake! Our waiter was not all there. I felt like it was the first day they opened because everyone was walking around dazed and confused. I expected it to be overpriced but don't mind if the quality is top notch, it was far from that. Food was not so good, pretty bland if I had to describe it. We had the ROK ceviche, rice tuna, hangar steak and the omakase. Only thing we absolutely loved was the sparkling SAKE and that's why they get 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"The complete experience was a fail.   Our server seemed like he was high, couldn't get our orders right and took such a long time. He seemed confused when we asked him questions about the menu, which was very off putting.  The rolls weren't anything special either.  The Rok & Roll, which is their signature roll, was bland. The presentation was fabulous! But the taste was just lacking.  The Volcano Roll tasted better than the Rok & Roll, but still failed to meet expectations. It was supposed to have a Spicy Dynamite Sauce, but I didn't even taste it. Eel, cream cheese, spicy snow crab and scallop- all those things were in the roll but I simply did not taste.  But if you really have to come and eat here, I would recommend the Rok Shrimp Tempura, because it was the only good dish that we had."}
{"text":"Set your expectations appropriately before dining at this modern Japanese restaurant at the Park next to New York New York. This is the quintessential Las Vegas experience with a show, performed by the servers, that breaks out periodically throughout the night with an engaging MC, great dancers, and plenty of loud music. This isn't the place to dine if you're looking for a romantic night out. This is the place you come to with a good group of friends to party and drink. The food is pretty good, with some dishes surprisingly good, but it's the totality of the experience that makes a night at Sake Rok special. Have fun, drink, laugh, sing, and prepare to be entertained. And, along the way you'll eat some pretty good food."}
{"text":"Sake Rok is a super trendy sushi place on the Vegas strip. We came here for dinner and loved it!  There was no wait (went around 7pm) and the service was great. The staff was friendly and they even perform brief dances and shows led by their flamboyant host.   We ordered Sashimi Tacos, Tiger Roll, and Volcano Roll. Though the portions were small, the fish was incredibly fresh. Everything was delicious especially the Sashimi Tacos (be warned... they're tiny)! Tiger Roll was well balanced in terms of texture and taste. Between the two rolls, we would recommend the Tiger Roll for its taste and spice!   We ended with the Honey Toast for dessert. And it is a MUST ORDER. It is a crispy, sweet, and warm delight! It'll also fill you up so we highly recommend saving room for it!"}
{"text":"Great amazing food. And a FUNtastic floor show... Highly recomended for your next trip.to Las Vegas..."}
{"text":"The place looked cool until the host who looked cracked out and washed out performer opened his mouth! He ruined dinner. The food was good but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food. The High Stakes roll is worth every penny with that A5 Wagyu and truffle oil. The complexity of flavors is absolutely masterful and is 5 stars all the way down to presentation and execution. Every single roll or dish I've had here has surpassed expectations. Order anything, it's going to be amazing.  The service has been impeccable with friendly, knowledgeable and attentive staff, and the entertainment is on par. They have a show where all the staff participate in dancing and singing and involving the guests. The whole experience from walking through the door to leaving has been amazing. Highly recommended, will dine again."}
{"text":"Food was good, not the best sushi I ever had, but still good. Our waiter didn't show up to our table so after about 10 minutes of waiting  I went and asked the hostess if we could get service and she was very accommodating. Our waiter showed up and basically did the minimum he could to get a tip. Again, he wasn't bad but wasn't really helpful or friendly either.   Overall, if was an ok experience but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We sat for 20 minutes with not one bump from a server. We even asked a girl who our be our server would be. We watched 2 other tables get seated & served before we finally walked out. We got 'sorry's' from ladies cleaning tables as we quietly walked out. It was before a hokey game & the place wasn't busy either. I was totally bummed because sushi before the game would have been a total bonus!"}
{"text":"I wanted to have sushi the night before I leave Las Vegas. So I searched through social media and found Sake Rok. Curious, I went. The greeter was busy with a customer. So another got me to a table. Then over the loudspeaker someone was asking how we are all doing. Minutes later, an MC like figure shows up. It was Ru Paul or at least someone who looked like him. Madonna's \"Vogue\" plays on the speaker and the servers start dancing . I wondered if an audition was included in their job interviews  I wanted to have a light dinner so I had Miso soup, my favorite nigiri and one of their special rolls. I thought the entertainment was awesome. Some customers were invited to dance, not I unfortunately but then again I might have done something unconventional. After all I was in Vegas. The servers were very helpful, attentive and did I mention entertaining . The food was a little pricey but then again I was in Vegas . I have a such a wonderful experience there that I told my best friend, who lives in Italy, that the next time he visits the US we come to Vegas. So we could come here more than once . When I left the restaurant I was such in a great mood and that stayed with me for the rest of the evening. Thank you Sake Rock"}
{"text":"I looked up Japanese places on the Strip since Zuma at Cosmo was closed until 5pm. Sake Rok popped up and boasted of live entertainment from their wait staff between table aisles, but only for dinner. AYCE sushi option before 4pm! Not bad for $25-35: basic to speciality sushi options with sushi rolls, limited nigiri, starters, and mochi. I heard it's probably the best AYCE deal on the whole Strip. Be prepared to pay extra for leftovers, including rice. Order only 3 items at a time. Late lunch was a quiet affair, save for the fun group celebrating with multiple rounds of sake bombs. I almost tried a Bunny bomb! Bacardi dragonberry rum & sparkling white peach sake, one of these days ...   Benjamin was our fun waiter and engaged in friendly convo with my friend (bday girl) and me. He said he had half a mind to bring us those sake bombs. We pretty much had a snack since dinner with the family was an hour later haha. Friend got ramen and I ordered the Peter Parker roll (fried soft shell crab) plus garlic edamame. Those beans were sour, lots of lime and not enough garlic. Made me miss spicy garlic edamame real bad from Aniki's back home. I tried the ramen and it's decent. PP roll was snack worthy and tasty. I'd definitely have to order another for a full lunch. Round crispies on the outside gave a satisfying crunch.   Interior looks cool and loft-like with two levels, and I heard a private function room on a third floor? I'd say ask for a second floor table along the glass wall to overlook downstairs for optimum entertainment viewing. Make a reservation for peak hours. To get here, walk past Shake Shack and Bruxie's, toward the T-Mobile arena. There's also an outside bar with comfy seats and heating lamps."}
{"text":"Fantastic soups and sushi. True Japanese style. One of the best I have ever had and I eat in many cities worldwide."}
{"text":"The most interactive and delicious dining experiences I have had in my life.  The fact that the otoro was just as fresh as Japan and the honey toast was the best I ever had was just the appetizer to the experience.  The boy band presentation that was inclusive of every worker in the joint was impressive. It's like they hire cirque de soil servers.  Make this a destination spot because it's a show and bomb dinner in one."}
{"text":"Okay. I don't even know where to start. First, if I could give our experience a 10, I would. Our server Amy was amazing. We explained to her that a few of us had food allergies. I'm gluten free and my friend is allergic to shellfish. She throughly explained to us what we can order and what we shouldn't. She even asked the sushi chef about a couple rolls just to make sure they were indeed gluten free. I ordered the tiger roll, spicy tuna roll, and salmon nigiri. All were very good.  Now on to the entertainment! Sake Rok is dinner and a show. Every 30 mins the servers do a little skit. The creative director was awesome and made our experience memorable! Will definitely be back. Thanks for making our friend Micha's birthday a great experience!"}
{"text":"Love love the feel and vibe to this place!!! It is located on the strip next to New York New York (The Park area) Staff was super friendly and interactive with their customers  Taste: 3.5 stars- For appetizers we ordered the seaweed salad and pork belly. Both were fantastic. I thought the pork belly would be crispy but it was fatty and still yummy. We ordered 2 sushi rolls: rok and roll... and I can't seem to remember the other rolls name but it had eel, crab and some lemony foam thing on top of it. The sushis were such a disappointment. I thought the crab stuffing inside tasted very dry and old. Also, I didn't really like the foamy stuff it was topped with.  Price/portion: 3 stars- the plating and portion was okay. The plating could be much nicer in presentation for the pricing  Atmosphere: 5 stars- very hip, modern and nice vibe. Great selection of music and decor  Service: 5 stars- excellent, very welcoming and friendly  We would definitely come back to try something different off the menu... maybe their drinks too"}
{"text":"I get they are trying to go for a certain ambiance - but the service did not match it. The 2 Stars is really because of the taste of the food which was okay. Overpriced, but hey its Vegas. What I did not like was the service. We were greeted by a miserable hostess, who cheered up when she learned me and my girlfriend were there for EDC. We had a bus boy tell us how they have been open a couple months, things were up and down, and he hates his job. And correct me if I am wrong, but our server does not believe in smiling or anything beyond a monotone pitch. Our entrees came out first - then our appetizers which took and abnormal amount of time for not being busy at all. They got our order wrong and forgot a seaweed salad, which we ended up canceling because it actually tasted disgusting."}
{"text":"I was highly impressed with this restaurant. I would recommend the King Crab California roll and Wagyu sliders. Amazing!!! Staff is very friendly and welcome teaching about what they offer and what sake to pair with your food. Good variety!"}
{"text":"Was invited here for a friend's birthday. It was a good time, good music, and interactive entertainment. Great place for birthday parties."}
{"text":"This is a vegas experience unlike any other. Great food, amazing atmosphere. This is a vegas must. Stop by after a knights game!"}
{"text":"Something new on the strip.  Nice decor and great host.  Food is very tasty but small in portion.  We had the sushi tacos see pic 5 bucks per taco.  So yes pricey. The sashimi is fresh and the rolls are very good.  There is a dance performance show every 30 minutes or so.  Over all it was very nice and I say check it out.  And if you want to see something cool order the Godzilla platter.  It's only 200 bucks."}
{"text":"This place is a delight.  With entertaining staff, a versatile DJ, fantastic food and creative drinks there is sure to be something for just about anyone who loves sushi!  I almost took tempura home to go after dinner!  We had a rather large party of rugby players and they worked hard to manage us and our chaos in a creative and accommodating way so I want to thank them for that.  We did have one rugby player who fell asleep at the table that they asked to leave, which we understand.  A few drinks after playing 3 games of rugby that day will do it to you.  . All and all I will not hesitate to come back and bring friends."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh! So much fun! The food was amazing - and the service was some of the best that I've had in Las Vegas. 2016 has sucked and I needed a night like this. We felt important from the moment we walked in 'till the very end! Thank you staff - management - ownership -- you guys definitely know what you're doing. I've been in the hospitality industry for 15 years and it's easy to recognize talent. I woke up the next morning - smiling at my Snapchat stories and reading comments from my friends asking me to take them there when they visit. I will be back! Just wanted to throw some positive energy out there!  Order the honey toast!!! Best in Las Vegas. Sorry Ichiza!"}
{"text":"Why hadn't I tried this place sooner?  The minute I walked in I felt super welcomed.  I have never been someplace where I have had so many personal conversations with employees.  The bartender Frank was so genuinely personable and attentive, and made amazing food & drink recommendations.  He was super accommodating to make sure nothing I ordered contained anything I am allergic to (wasabi, in a sushi restaurant, how annoying am I?)   The Whiskey on the ROK cocktail spoke to my whiskey loving soul. Frank even educated me about the cherry on the garnish.  To start, I went with his recommendation of the crispy rice. It was an incredible flavor and texture combo, with just enough spice.  I will never NOT get this dish when I go there.  I went again with recommendations and next got the tiger roll and the Brussels sprouts. The tiger roll was awesome, but how often does a vegetable impress you?  The sprouts were the perfect texture.  The hospitality in this place was crazy on point.  I had conversations with the Chef (Joe, great food!!!) and manager, Craig.  Since I went for lunch, I missed the entertainment that happens nightly.  When asked about what goes on, Craig took the time to take me on a tour of the restaurant, and explain to me the different aspects of the entertainment.  He even pointed out interesting facts of the place (local artist for the murals on the walls, which is a nice touch!)   Overall, obviously very impressed with this place, and will be back with friends, so we can catch the entertainment, and try more amazing food!"}
{"text":"Located in the Mgm Park area (between the  New York New York and the old Monte Carlo). This restaurant has a hip vibe and a lot of action. The prices for their food is a bit on the pricier side, however everything that we ate was awesome. My wife and I shared the pork belly, steak and scallops. Out of those three items, the scallops were the best. It came with 5 nice portioned scallops in a delicious butter sauce.   However, that made this restaurant stand out was the entertainment that came with the dinner. There was live dancing and crowd participation. If you want a dinner and a show and a place to have fun, then this Is the spot. We definitely want to try this place again the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"First of all... I'm a total douchebag for not taking photos of the beautiful presentation of our sushi rolls.  We had the El Chapo, the Tiger, and Volcano rolls.  All were incredibly delicious.  The El Chapo's flavor and texture were absolute perfection.  We also enjoyed the House Sake.  I don't like sake... but I really enjoyed this!  The ambiance is insane with graffiti art, DJ, and Drag Queen MC Roking the house.  Nicely done."}
{"text":"Hot rocks steak, sake flight, el chapo roll, spicy garlic edamame and can't forget their amazing honey toast! Great party atmosphere with constant entertainment lots of dancing."}
{"text":"I came around 4pm on a Monday so the place was empty which was great to have the whole place to myself. I sat at the sushi bar and ordered the omakase for $40 which was 12 pieces of sushi. In my opinion it was the best deal they had. Most of the other items typical of vegas strip were over priced.   The sushi itself was pretty typical. I liked the squid and shiso leaf nigiri. I gave it 4 stars because the staff was nice, sushi decent, and price was not ridiculous for the strip. I cannot speak much for the other items on the menu other than the omakase."}
{"text":"This place was great! Cesar Q was an amazing server! He is very friendly the food was great as well! Also the fact that they provided a military discount is amazing! My son was home on leave from the navy and loved this place. And the fact that they had ALL YOU CAN EAT WAS WONDERFUL"}
{"text":"Sake rok is so fun. Love the vibe and the food. Music is bumping and a great place to come with friends before a night out in Vegas. The emcee Jonnis was hilarious and totally made our night. There were sexy dance performances throughout the night. The edamame here is the best I've had."}
{"text":"First time here, we went around 7 pm and waited a bit to be seated. The place is nice and definitely not your average sushi place. Music going on in the background awesome vibe and environment.  The sushi is a bit pricey, but sooooooo good!!! I ordered karage chicken, tried the shishito peppers, sushi, tried a bit of the waygu beef (someone else at the table ordered it.) It all tasted very delicious to me.   Back to what I was saying about not your average sushi restaurant... it's really not; and I'm okay with it! I had so much fun watching and listening to the MC/ host  that was talking and going around the table. They also had an intermission where the staff all danced and was part of a mini show. They also had people dance with them too.   I've never been to a restaurant like this, had delicious food and awesome entertainment. If you're in the area, check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving this a 5. It's loud, obnoxious, completely touristy - and I had a great time. Our server, whose name I don't recall, was so friendly - she really made the night for us.  We ended up here because we had to be somewhere around 11:30 and we were pushed for time to find something on the Strip at 9:30 on a Friday. We didn't realized what type of place this was until we sat down. I swallowed my pride and accepted it.  Turns out I was just being pretentious.   The food was actually pretty good and affordable. The environment was nice and the entire staff was friendly. The random entertainment was ultra cheesy but in a more ironic 'we are in on the joke' kind of way then making me feel like a suburban tourist.  We were pleasantly surprised and walked out with a smile on our face. Honestly, give it a shot, you'll have fun."}
{"text":"I need to make a recommendation... the crispy rice is B-O-M-B!!! I came here for a girls night out and I can say this place is the best. I've never been to any restaurant that has servers performing. Jonnis, the MC, is awesome. He has so much energy and brings so much enthusiasm to each table... such a people person. He makes the performances. This is definitely my it plac to come to!!!"}
{"text":"Food is average. Extremely overpriced. Service was not that great either. Bartender, bathroom attendant, and show host were all very friendly and fun. As a local I would not go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and something about it just seemed off.... a little grungy, a little cheesy, a little touristy.  This is not fine dining, this is party dining. Which is fine if that's what you are looking for (I'm in favor of a good party night out now and again!) or if you are on college spring break.  Any place that has all you can eat sushi deal with caveats so they can charge you more if you don't meet their requirements (such as not finish your plate) feels a bit scam-like to me.  My rolls were fine, but the same price as my visit to the sushi bar at Paris (which was 2x better in quality and taste)."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun!! The entertainment show had me in the feels with the boy-bands ! And that honey toast was so good !"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, got the scallops and they were some of the best I've eaten, had to get a speciality role as well got the girl on the beach (I believe that was the name) and it was so good. The service was really good too, food came out quick and it was so good. The only issue I had was dessert took 40 minutes, this was really unacceptable. So skip out on the dessert if you have to be somewhere but get dessert if you do have a lot of time to kill. Would go back especially if your looking for a solid sushi spot on the strip"}
{"text":"Went to sake rok during lunch on a Sunday and it wasn't packed at all - recommend using open table to reserve though because the waitress asked for our reservation before we were seated. The inside of the sushi bar had a underground Japanese bar vibe to it - I can only image how lively it got at night!   The food was great! We ordered the shrimp ceviche and brussel sprouts as appetizers and we're not disappointed. The ceviche was good but with only (4) pieces and a party of 3, we had to fight to see who would get the last piece haha. The brussel sprouts were AMAZING and that's coming from someone who swears against eating them. It tasted like they were dipped in eel sauce and covered with Panko bread crumbs. Seriously. try them out you won't regret it. For entrees we ordered the volcano roll (5 pieces), rok & roll (5 pieces), and tiger roll (8 pieces). They were all good (I've had better) although, I favored the volcano roll the best. We also had a side of Japanese style elote and that was decent as well but definitely not as good as traditional Mexican elote. Nothing too amazing.   Service was alright considering the place was nowhere near being packed for lunch time.   It was a good lunch but can get pretty pricey for just lunch so keep that in mind. (2) appetizers, (3) rolls, (1) side, and tap water for 3 people. Spent about $124 (that's including tip - $104 before tip). I hear the dinners are entertaining so maybe check it out during that time!"}
{"text":"I'm a combination of a sushi novice and picky eater and this place fulfilled! Delicious. Girl, you with the weird sushi \"weirdness,\" this place gets my vote. GO."}
{"text":"Make sure you are willing to spend over two hours for lunch if you're going to eat here.  I went to this place for Saturday lunch. We were the only customers there. There were three sushi chefs. They were soooo slow! Most of the stuff we ordered was sashimi and sushi, which shouldn't take too long to prepare. It took us over 1hour to get everything we ordered.  And the portions were so small, we were still hungry, but didn't want to wait any longer. Also,  when the food came out, the Servers didn't know the names of sushi.  They only explained basic stuff, like salmon and sushi, but couldn't answer which one was hirame, yellow tail, etc."}
{"text":"My friends and I were partying all week from Thursday night to Friday day pool party, Friday nightclub, and Saturday pool party again and had catch our flight home on Saturday night.  We were exhausted but a girls gotta eat!   We decided to check out Sake Rok as our last stop before heading to the airport. I made reservations for 7PM but was running 15 minutes late but when we got there they were able to accommodate us and seat us quickly. Which I really appreciate cause I was getting kind of hangry (so hungry + I was getting angry) ... hehehe.   The energy in the room was contagious! Being in the hot sun, dancing and drinking all day  can take a lot out of you, but the food and vibe there brought us back to life! I could see my friends faces light up as we were entertained by the music from the live DJ and then the show!   I'm big on ambiance, art, architecture and decor and the place is beautifully designed! Every inch of that place looked like it was hand picked with incredible detail. To the signs, to the beautiful art on the brick walls which I was told was painted by a local graffiti artist. Even down to the napkins folded into shirts! OMG the white leather (hopefully pleather ) crocodile design  looking  seats are very cool looking and comfortable too!   Timing was impeccable, the food came out fast and was delicious! You could taste the quality in each item! The salt and pepper shrimp was my favorite item on the menu, it makes me salivate just thinking about it, simple but oh so good! I love rolls and we got the El Chapo and The girl on the beach did not disappoint! We also got the ceviche, which was way better than I expected because I always think ceviche is hit or miss but it was really good, and came with these yummy chips. The Mochi was really good, I suspect Bubbies (from Hawaii my favorite!) Mochi which are the best around, unless they made them in house the chocolate, had crunchy chocolate chips inside. I consider myself a bit of a Mochi conoisoire.   We didn't get the Godzilla platter but I saw several tables getting it and it looked really cool! The presentation was dope, did my eyes deceive me or was there smoke coming out of the Godzilla as it was served to the table?  Service was on point too! My water was always filled, which was great because well partying in the Vegas desert can dehydrate you. Empty dishes were promptly taken away. Our server Vince was excellent, and we were able to get out of their quickly because we had a flight to catch!   I will definitely make Sake Rok a stop every time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was so fun!!!! We had a wonderful server and we loved the MC. Don't get me started on the food everything was delicious and their drinks are fresh and fun! I had the dragon fly cocktail and it was great. Amazing bar staff great looking people. I can't wait to bring my family here when they visit for the dinner and show that is Sake Rok!!"}
{"text":"I came to Sake Rok during their grand opening but didn't have a chance to try dessert because our group basically ordered everything off the menu and we didn't save enough room in our bellies.   My go to place for honey toast is Ichiza...but now...forget that! Sake Rok blows it out of the water!   I sat at the bar this past Friday night. Our bartendar Ty was amazing. He said it was his first day, but he nailed every aspect of service! Plus, he's outgoing and silly. In fact the whole staff is just so lively and I love the fact that they interact with the guests.   Now to the honey toast. What makes it different are the honey glazed \"croutons\" in the honey toast. I never had anything like it. We devoured the whole thing in minutes and the best was last - the BOTTOM of the honey toast which was gooey and soaked with honey. I would come back just for this dessert!    Great atmosphere, great service, great dessert."}
{"text":"Josh and kevin make excellent food. They have O toro here (tuna belly) which is super rare and especially delicious.  Hand rolls were lovely, nigori sake on the menu and excellent mochi for dessert. We stopped in several places before choosing here and are so glad we did. What a perfect first restaurant to try on our vacay. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The mc was rude to us, I guess because we brought kids, but we didn't really know what kind of a place this was. The sushi was way overpriced and mediocre. The waitress poured water into our sprite which seemed like something that apparently happens often here."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for a department dinner and it was wonderful. The staff was accommodating and the entertainment was great. From beginning to the end of the night the music selection catered to everyone in the group. Couldn't have asked for a better place to take our team to relax and have fun."}
{"text":"Solo diners beware: You will be ignored. I showed up this evening to a mostly empty restaurant with loud pumping club music and a deejay talking to himself (?!). The greeters were very nice and seated me right away at a completely empty sushi bar (?!). After five minutes of neither the sushi chefs nor a server so much as acknowledging my presence, I left. Clearly they're not interested in my business."}
{"text":"Amazing. This has to be the coolest sushi joint I've ever been too. The sushi was so fresh and delicious. The atmosphere was so hyped up thanks to the all the servers. A perfect spot to go to at the park. They have a good selection of sushis and sake. I wish we had a spot like this in LA."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and were greeted by Tyler, the bartender.  He was great! Super friendly, great with recs on Vegas happenings and what food to get for light bites at Sake Rok. We weren't really hungry but wanted to check the place out. Ended up getting the eel avocado roll, shishito peppers and the edamame Rok which is served in an Asian garlic butter chili sauce that is to die for. The food was amazing. I wish I was more hungry and would have gone for the all you can eat sushi deal that they have for $25. That is a steal, especially on the strip. Between the great food, of course tasty sake and awesome bartender,I was super happy. Next time I am in Vegas, I will make sure I am hungry enough for the all you can eat."}
{"text":"OMFG! This is some of the freshest and most delicious sushi! We are rom the NYC area and this place ruined me! So amazing! Oysters were perfect! Super cold and fresh and yummmm! Calling all foodies!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Sake Rok for dinner around 6pm. I sat at the bar and was one of only maybe ten people in the entire restaurant. I ordered a tiger roll and the edamame Rok as an appetizer. Someone from the kitchen brought the roll first. As the bartender was nowhere to be found, I had to find my own chop sticks, but couldn't find a napkin. I had finished my roll before the bartender ever came to check on me. I had to ask about the edamame, which came out after another ten minutes. The food was good, everything had a kick. Just terrible service. I can only imagine how bad the service is when the restaurant is full. Usually when the appetizer comes out after you are done with dinner, the restaurant would give it to you for free. Nope, not here, not even an apology."}
{"text":"The best food ever the drinks the hosts the drinks are so tasty and fancy in flavor and looks."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout and have sushi and enjoy some entertainment!  Great atmosphere definitely a place I recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best and freshest sushi I've ever had in my entire life! We were in Vegas for my moms 50th birthday and her and I were craving sushi but had no clue where to go. Of course my fellow Yelpers never let me down because according to the stars this place was where we needed be. It's fairly new and the decor is out of this world gorgeous! It's so vegas inside with pops of red and the chairs are like ivory colored snake skin. We ordered like 3 specialty rolls that were dynamite! (Wish I remembered the names of them) the staff were all upbeat, friendly and very attentive! The music was POPPIN too. We went early in the day so it washer crowded but word on the street is that in the evening it gets jam packed and def a party atmosphere! I can't wait to go back to Vegas to get my sushi fix. Put it this way the sushi was SO good that I haven't had any since coming here in May 2016 because no other sushi place can compare!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Came here on 4/2 for a sneak preview. The staff and service are excellent. Perfect spot for cocktails and sushi and a welcome escape from the strip chaos. The menu is uncomplicated with a focus on select ingredients and everything from light cucumber rolls to more adventurous fried chicken roll. Very inventive! We tried the edamame with lemon and garlic (must have!), the shishito peppers (very good!) and probably every roll on the menu. I am allergic to all shellfish and Albert was the most accommodating host and went out of his way to recommend allergen friendly rolls as well as customize a few of the spicy tuna ones to exclude crab et al. Thank you Sake Rok!"}
{"text":"Not sure why Yelp has this restaurant as $$. You can order a roll of sushi (yes one roll) for $25. We got two beers, and an appetizer, the \"sashimi tacos\", for $15. The three \"tacos\" that arrived at our table were each smaller than a single piece of sushi. Also, if you are looking to have a conversation, look elsewhere.  The atmosphere is more of a club than a restaurant, which might explain the prices.  We decided to leave and go to in and out afterwards."}
{"text":"Tip: If you want high end sake (Kubota Manju, Onigoroshi, Kotzusumi, etc.) there is a bunch available off the menu.  Tip #2: Fish quality isn't great, so don't come here for the sushi.  This was a tough review, because Sake Rok does have two big positives: 1) Servers were attentive and really friendly; 2) Alcohol! Liquor selection is excellent, cocktail list is extensive with fun/quality options, and top shelf sake is available (although, as I mention above, off the menu).  The problem is that the food quality wasn't impressive. The fish quality was not good so I would avoid any sushi items here, and the non-sushi dishes were hit or miss. I really liked the tomahawk steak, the mushroom tobanyaki, the seared scallops, and the wagyu sliders. But OTOH I didn't like either the tuna or beef tataki, the shishito peppers were super oversalted, and the \"rok\" shrimp tempura and the shrimp/vegetable tempura weren't breaded that well (and both very small portion size). Also, I've been here twice but they were out of the honey toast dessert on both occasions. Bummer.  But I could see this spot possibly working out if you're mainly coming to have drinks and enjoy the atmosphere (music plays loudly here, and waitstaff will periodically perform in choreographed dance shows), and plan to have food as a side / secondary priority (or you have to stick with very specific items that you know are good). If food is at all the #1 priority, I think you'll be disappointed. And again, I'd avoid the sushi no matter what.  Given all the above, I think 1.5-2* for food, +1* for service and strong alcohol selection is fair."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! The food was fantastic, the layout was terrific, and the show....incredible. I have worked at NYNY for almost 2 years and for some stupid reason, never been to Sake Rok! I know, what a fool! So I went last night before the hockey game and it was such a great time. Our waitress was really friendly, but I kept looking at this guy with the flowing locks and wild eye makeup walking around wondering wth. Then the show started, dancing, singing, everyone clapping along, it was terrific and he in particular was awesome. I had no idea what to expect, but when the entire wait staff lined up with sunglasses on and all did the dance to Will Smith's Men in Black song with the video on the giant screen in the background, I lost it! I couldn't help but smile and laugh and sing along. What a great visit and I sure as hell won't wait another two years to go back. Kudos to the staff, you made our night."}
{"text":"After we were finish walking to the Coca cola store to grab some stuff, we stopped by here for a quick lunch.  The place was kinda empty when we arrived.  We got seated immediately.  There menu was pretty impressive.  They have this Godzilla thing I forgot the name of it but it was pretty cool.  Too bad I wasn't that hungry.  I opted for the 12 piece sashimi, chef's choice.    Its not the best sushi I've ever had but its definitely pretty good still.  The fish was fresh but not extremely fresh.  I think with the heat of the summer its kinda hard for that to be possible but it was still as fresh as can be.  It didn't have any smelly fish scent so that's always good.  The taste was on point.  I finished my plate in no time and was left pretty satisfied.  My friend was also left pretty satisfied.  The wasabi had a huge kick to it though.  We made the mistake of using too much lol.  The décor is very modern and nice.  The open so you don't really feel cramped.  The tables are a bit small but they worked fine.  The service was on point.  Everyone had their A game on that day.  That's what catapulted this review up an extra star in my books.  Excellent service and the chefs were all really cool and awesome too.  My only regret was that I didn't sit at the sushi bar.  Next time....next time.  Overall I really like this place.  Its a nice joint to grab some Japanese food and some delicious sushi when in Vegas.  Located near the Shake Shack and New York New York its a nice spot to come hang and enjoy some quality food."}
{"text":"THe food was okay, but what really stood out as way subpar was the service. They just couldn't get it together, mistake after mistake. They seemed to be super busy doing bad lip sync. The redemining quality was the honey toast, it was good. But the service was awful, we kept having to ask for our dishes, they brought the wrong stuff, it was a shitshow of mistakes."}
{"text":"Good sushi!!! My favorite was the volcano roll. The music is awesome and they have entertainment, which makes the atmosphere of this place fun! We also tried their dessert which was honey toast with berries and ice cream, but wasn't a big fan of it. This place turns into a bar after the kitchen closes, good place to pre game before heading out for the tonight."}
{"text":"Whoa. If you like entertainment during dinner, this is it. I came here to order my food to go because it was near where I was staying. First time here. I ordered the pork belly and girl on the beach roll. I sat at the bar area while I waited for my food. The bartender was very nice and friendly. The interior looked great. Japanese theme. Love the art wall.   There was a staff member in a fun looking, drag costume. He's an MC for the restaurant. He came up to me and said hi. I saw him went up to a table and chatted with the customers at that table. All of sudden, he spoke into a microphone about fashion and then, music came on. The staff and the MC were dancing and singing to Psy Gangnam Style song. They ran up to the stage and ended their song. The music got cut off and everything went back to normal. Wow. I thought that was fun and funny. It made me smile. My wait for food was definitely entertaining and time went by.   Got my order and went back to my hotel room. Yuummm, the braised pork belly was off the hook. The fats melts in your mouth. It's so good. Recommend it. The sushi roll was small, but it did fill me up.   It was so good that I came back for the 2nd time during my stay and got the pork belly to go. I arrived near to closing time. I got my food and went back to my hotel room. This time, the pork belly was old and dry. It wasn't moist like my first time. I'm thinking they were out of pork belly and gave me the last scrap of what they had left. There were no fats at all. Just dry, lean meat. I was a bit disappointed. Lesson learned, do not come at closing time.   I still give it 4 stars due to my first experience. I would definitely come back again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Overpriced and sushi options are limited and small portions. Atmosphere is cool and fun so I guess you are overpaying for the entertainment. Cool idea nice spot but wish the sushi was better and bigger."}
{"text":"A little noisy, but good fusion if you aren't looking for some real Japanese. But, hey they have karaage and edamame so it's somewhat legit. Be ready for the performances."}
{"text":"The decor and staff were nice but unfortunately the sushi was just not up to par. My husband and I ordered the rok and roll (?), the el chapo roll with some sort of tomatillo sauce and a sashimi platter. The rok and roll is about 5 pieces of sushi on skewers that resemble lollipops. The fish was more like a cheap chopped up filling and had a texture similar to canned tuna. There was very little flavor. The el chapo roll was tiny and again had very little flavor. The sashimi was the best dish we ordered but still tasted a bit dry, almost as if it wasn't fresh. We love sushi and never have a problem finishing what we order (which is usually more than 2 rolls and a few pieces of sashimi), but we didn't even finish the food here. Our meal came out to $200 so it was definitely a huge disappointment (especially when we were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary). Also, kind of off topic but the restroom is very small and is shared with men's stalls on one side and women's on the other. It is strange and uncomfortable. Every person in there was complaining that they felt awkward and was not a fan of the space. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great place, and the atmosphere is amazing. Great and friendly staff, delicious food and drinks. A Vegas must."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and has delicious sushi. It's a bit pricey but not worse than most places on the Strip. Would definitely go back! We had the Puff the Dragon Roll and the Colorful Roll (went for lunch with some friends who were visiting)."}
{"text":"Thoroughly unimpressed with this place. Once again these restaurants in Las Vegas would rather be trendy with female servers wearing tight pants! I guess that is supposed to distract us from the 35 minutes you wait between plates of sushi in an all you can eat establishment take me if you want hour to eat! With only four tables occupied during lunch I fear to see how bad this place operates when they're busy. There are definitely many other places better than Ness that are all you can eat."}
{"text":"Came for the lunch specials  Limited menu , but what the served was  quality. Gluten-free options are available  The chefs are knowledgeable and stated that the krab mix is Gluten-free  Tamari is served when requested  PS came at lunch when it is quite At night the photo look amazing if you're 25 year old"}
{"text":"All I can say is...wow wow wow. What an amazing experience we had at Sake Rok. Totally blown away. Everything from the food, to the drinks, to all the lights and music and dancing servers....what a blast.  And did I say ambience ?? Its unlike one I've seen at any other restaurant. The host was running around the restaurant singing and playing drinking games with the diners. It totally set the mood to one that matches the aura of Las Vegas. Get drunk..get high...party   We had couple of sushi rolls...the tiger roll and Vulcan roll. Both were really good..especially the Vulcan. Then game the shots and those were fun too.  In between the entire server group as well as the host started to dance and totally rocked with the music. Have to say that was really fun to see and quite a surprise to us.  Overall I'd highly recommend this gem of a place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of Transgender women and we were treated poorly. Our order was lost and not placed by the waiter. Our service was non existent and the discrimination against trans people was atrocious.  Unacceptable behavior  from management  and staff."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Sake Rok and like before they didn't disappoint!!!! Such a fun restaurant with Amazing Food. I can't say enough about the sushi and how fresh it is - the best I have ever had. The service is amazing and not one server walks by your table without filling water or checking on you. The whole environment is so much fun and you definitely leave looking forward to the next time you can return. A sure place to go with a group and you are definitely going to have a good time but we have went with just two of us and it was still a great time. Every app we have had as well as the hanger steak have been fantastic. Look forward to going back and a great place to go before or after an event at the TMobile arena."}
{"text":"Creative food favor and combinations. We had the Grilled Cauliflower Bok Choy, Crispy Tofu AND Grilled salmon with green peppers. The taste is unique and identifiable. The service is very good too. There was some stage show rehearsal going on at the background, a fun place to dine in.   I'm not a big fan for loud music and flashy lights. But I didn't mind the lights and music in the restaurant. After all, we are in Vegas, right?!  I would come back again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. Some of the best sushi I've ever had in my life. My two friends and I did the unlimited sushi deal for $25 & $35 and it was worth every penny. Ask for Caesar like the salad not the cat whisperer. 10/10"}
{"text":"It was my first evening ever in Vegas and my friends and I were craving sushi. I saw this business on Yelp and was sold by the overall score and pictures, and then we arrived.  At first glance, I was confused because I thought we were walking into a nightclub. The music is loud but good and everyone is dressed to the nines. We were starving so willing to stay and see what happens.  We were promptly seated but not given menus. At first we weren't sure if it was a mistake but then I quickly noticed that the hostess wasn't giving anyone menus. After a couple of minutes, our waitress showed up with them and offered to answer any questions we had.   I ordered the Lily Pad, which was one of the most refreshing drinks I've ever had, so I ordered 2 of them. The drinks are pricey but worth every sip.  For my entree, I ordered the Tiger Roll. It had a subtle, crab/cucumber taste and then the heat from the spicy seasoning hit me. It was exactly what I wanted.   While we were eating and talking, the wait staff started singing and dancing, which was a great surprise!! They were dancing on a stage, on the bar, near the tables...they were everywhere. There was an awesome geisha who looked and sounded like Lady Gaga and she brought the house down. Seriously, she was awesome.   About 30 minutes later, they did another number. This time, our waitress was being carried in midair while doing a split. She was badass.  Sake Rok rocks!!! The only recommendation I have is giving the customers the menus once they're seated. Not doing so causes confusion and awkwardness."}
{"text":"Food = 2.5 stars  Atmosphere = 5 stars  If you are at Sake Rok, chances are you are trying to show an out-of-towner a fun time, wanting a dinner/show, or seeking something elevated from the mundane dining experience. Sake Rok can give you all those things. What it cannot give you is great food. I highly recommend this place for sake bombs, funny banter and dancing from the staff, and edamame.  It manages to be fun without being a tourist trap.  Great place to hang out before a hockey game or a fun birthday spot."}
{"text":"I stopped by to check out the restaurant week $50 fixed menu on a thur at 5:30 PM for a party of 3.  My previous visit was for quick drinks and appetizers before catching a concert and I had a blast.  I was excited for a sit down dinner experience at the high energy Sake Rok!  Service:  4/5 The hostess, our lead server and all the other servers helping out and bringing our food and keeping the drinks filled were awesome.  Everyone was very friendly and engaging and the emcee leading the sake bombs stopped by to say hi to my teenage niece and her grandmother.   Other than having to wait 30 minutes for our restaurant week mochi dessert, and 20 more minutes for the honey toast we ordered, the service was top notch.  A huge party of 60+ came in right before dessert  I found out they were Cisco employees who were coming in before going to the T-Mobile arena for their Cisco live concert. I understand service might slow down, but I'm pretty sure they knew this group was coming in and it didn't appear they were completely prepared.  This doesn't take away from the awesome staff.  Restaurant week $50 Dinner Course: 4/5 Edamame:  Fresh edmame and very tasty with the Sea Salt and Lime Hanger Steak:  The highlight of the dinner, delicious and prepped perfectly for me at medium rare.  The Mushrooms and the Aka Miso sauce were fantastic.  Coming back for this. Sushi: Chef chose your 4 piece Nigiri and I selected the 1/2 Kamikaze roll.  No issues considering this is a high volume fusion restaurant with sushi. Mochi:  You get 3 assorted flavor mochi which was perfect.  Madre went with the Sata Andagi/Japanese doughnuts which were tasty. Off the restaurant menu we ordered the squid nigiri which was fine and the Honey Toast which was excellent.  They didn't skimp on the Ice Cream and Berries well done.  Ambiance: 5/5  I love the Ultra modern Neo Japanese deco. I love that there's an emcee leading the sake bomb charge and that the servers do dance shows throughout the night. The \"Godzilla Platter\" presentation is a spectacle that's fun. The Emcee and DJ keeps the energy up vibe lively.  Value: 3.5/5 The restaurant week menu gave pretty good value in my opinion.  It's a little cheaper than what we would have paid off the menu but the in house entertainment is where the real value kicks in.  Sake Rok is a great place to grab a quick bite and drinks before seeing a concert at T-Mobile of partying on the strip.  It's loud, fun and the in house entertainment (and booze) will get you ready for a night out.  There are lots of great opportunities for Social Media pics and videos to keep your followers entertained.  I will be back for the sake rok craziness.  Enjoy.. =)"}
{"text":"Just went to this restaurant and the experience was HORRIBLE!!!! They gave my husband a beer in a dirty glass with lipstick on it. He was so grossed out, he couldn't even eat! We ended up just throwing the food out. Then, to top it off, I gave the waitress my credit card to pay for the meal and she dropped my card the floor. They came back  to my table 10 minutes later to tell me they couldn't find my card. You would think after all this they would offer to discount my meal or even comp it. But they didn't. This place is DISGUSTING!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place because it was close to us and the great reviews. THIS IS SERIOUSLY my favorite sushi place ever. You HAVE to get the Edamame Rok and the Crispy Brussel Sprouts, in addition to their rolls. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was exactly what I was looking for."}
{"text":"So it's our last night in Vegas and I wanted some sushi.  Now normally we would go to Sushi Samba but we wanted to try a new place.(biggest mistake).  The only reason I'm even giving this a 2 is due to the Art Deco and the food was good... Not great.   Our server Vince didn't listen when I asked for lemon with my Voss water, so my husband had to get up and go up to the bar.  Once the food was dropped off we had to wait another 5 minutes for the soy sauce.  Oh did I mention I also asked for a straw in which my husband once again had to get up and grab it from the bar!!   So basically the only time we saw our server Vince was when he took our order and when we finish eating he asked how it was and gave us the check...very inattentive server."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and amazing food!!! Great atmosphere! Highly recommend the salt and pepper shrimp and honey toast! The MJ is amazing too!"}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant I have been to,awsome sushi,great atmosphere and dancing staff:-)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here before going to the Weekend Concert at T Mobile Arena. Food is not good and should only deserve one star but 2 stars given for the atmosphere and ambiance. Loud and upbeat place so don't expect a quite dining experience. They do short singing and dancing shows intermittently that is quite entertaining. Jonnice can lively up the dining area with little effort. If you just want to grab a few drinks or cocktails and enjoy an upbeat experience, then visit Sake Rok."}
{"text":"This place rocks third floor balcony ordered prime rib garlic taters roll salad- Damn the prime rib - outrageously good! Then on to cocktails gentlemen jack for starters then on to double ole number 7 - umm hmm got to be entertained when the staff started coyote ugly on the bar was a trip all in all a great meetin place. It's worth it then mosey on to the arena for the country concert. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I did quite like this restaurant. The atmosphere is busy, it's a very wide open busy space. The tables are a little too close together, but it has a very fun almost party vibe. The sushi was good, not incredible, but good. Our server was great, attentive and quick. I always say my favorite sushi nigiri is uni with quail egg and salmon roe, and the better the sushi quality is at a restaurant the better that particular dish is. Sake Rok did it well, their uni was fresh. Conclusion: the sushi didn't rock my world, but it was good."}
{"text":"Awesome place, lots of fun!  If your on town make sure you check this place out!  I don't eat sushi but the options on their menus will definitely take care of your appetite!  Edamame, ROK chicken, pork dumplings, mixed vegetable tempura, and don't forget the Honey Toast for dessert!"}
{"text":"Sake rok is the bomb!!! My gf and I came here cuz we heard about the all you can eat for 25 bucks and all you can drink sake and beer for 20 bucks! Our server Chad was very knowledgeable and had great suggestions!  THE SUSHI IS DELICIOUS!!!!We will definitely come back! Thanks for the great 1st time experience Sake Rok! You guys ROK!!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and the entertainment was great. Tried the el chapo roll and it was by far the favorite. Delicious. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food, drinks, service! I highly highly recommend. Came for girls night for my birthday. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Awesome food and amazing drink menu! Entertainment was fun at they are all very talented!"}
{"text":"Sake Rok is the best. If you are ever looking for a place with great food and atmosphere this is the place to go. I have been there several times and anything you order is amazing. You won't be disappointed. Also at night the severs put on shows for you. Since you get a dinner and a show. Also the restaurant is beautiful."}
{"text":"It was still early but they were out of oysters, something we really looked forward to. Secondly, the shrimp tempura is crazily overpriced: you get 5 super small pieces and ask $15 for it. Additional order took ages. Sushi quality is good!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Great food. Live DJ music and dances by waitstaff to sushi chefs. Spicy Cold soba and mixed green salad great starters. Pork belly- omg! What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Solid event venue with fun performances by servers and good rolls.  We booked the space for the night and the team provided enough sake bombs, drinks, entertainment, and music for 4 hours despite the very limited seating and small dance floor.  The sushi was solid but I would recommend sticking with that - the other fare was pretty meh.  Also, the vegetarian options are basically limited to a vegetarian roll and some pretty bland \"roasted vegetable skewers.\"  I would just call ahead and ask that they prepare a vegetarian option ahead of time.  Other than that, the Kamikaze roll, volcano roll, mochi ice cream, ceviche, salmon avocado, and spicy tuna rolls were very good."}
{"text":"Here with a group of friends for a couple drinks at the bar.. service was amazing! Thanks for showing us a good time"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great service. Interactive entertainment. Creative food presentations. Everything you didn't know you even wanted in a restaurant is delivered here!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service!  Wonderful people, very friendly, genuinely sweet. DJ is so lively along with the rest of the crew. And food is mind blowing! And I'm a vegetarian saying this.  Definitely go there if you have a down spirit, or want to just have fun."}
{"text":"I went here for a pre-show dinner before JT's Man of the Woods tour. It was a good idea that I made reservations on Open Table because it was busy, even at 6pm on a Sunday. (Excitement of our Vegas Golden Knights fans, mixed with JT/Nsync fans).  We were seated in the 2nd level, which allowed us to see the show. This is a lively, interactive dining experience. I was kinda prepared for it, since there is a disclaimer/warning on the restaurant's website. There was a emcee, dressed up in rocker Japanese garb, who did sake bombs with a table whenever they were ordered. My favorite part of the act was the Nsync vs. Backstreet Boys medley they performed. All the wait staff do the dances along with the emcee. It was fantastic.  I wish I could say the same for the food. If you are a sushi fanatic, this is not the place for you. It was underwhelming. For the appetizers, we ordered pork gyoza, edamame, and shrimp/vegetable tempura. My one friend ordered miso soup. These were all pretty basic. They forgot our edamame. One friend ordered shrimp tempura roll, the other ordered more temura, requesting all sweet potato, which they accommodated. She also ordered a cocktail, assisted by our server's recommendation, claiming her choice was great, since she likes fruity drinks. My friend said that was not the case when she tasted it. She wished it was more sweet. For my main course, I ordered sake (salmon sashimi). It was highway robbery (in my opinion) to pay $5/piece. I got 2. It tasted the way it's supposed to. I was probably more excited to eat it since it was my first sushi since I had surgery 4 months ago.   I supposed, since we were on the Strip, that is the reason for the exorbitant prices. We decided to split the check in 3-ways, which amounted to $30/pp, including tip. Ridunkulous if you ask me. As my friend pointed out, it was more out of convenience that we chose this restaurant, as it was a stone's throw away from T-Mobile Arena.   Personally, I would not go to this establishment again. I will find another place to eat in The Park before my next concert."}
{"text":"There's a party in Las Vegas, and it's at Sake ROK. Great food, great service, and a show that is fun with a capital \"Yay!\"  Best seaweed salad ever, fantastic grilled cauliflower, and the mochi dessert is Awesome. I cannot say enough about it. Thank you Mike and Tianna. We came across this place by accident, but we'll be back by design.  Did I mention that we loved it? If you don't have fun here, you just can't have fun."}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent here. Unfortunately they had ran out of a couple sushis, but the waitress made alternative suggestions that were excellent. It is a pricey place though so just keep that in mind."}
{"text":"This place is poppin! The funnest sushi restaurant I've ever been to. Plus their sushi is amazzzzzing. They're all so tasty and unique. I can't remember which ones we ordered because we ordered a lot but one roll had this weird bubble stuff on it for added flavor. Wasn't a fan of that but still loved the restaurant and entertainment. The menus are ridiculously huge haha."}
{"text":"We celebrated Christmas in Las Vegas this year, a little early.  We were craving asian food and Sake Rok hit the spot.  It was within walking distance of our hotel on the strip so was quite convenient.  All of our food was delicious.  We had various pieces of sushi and some brussel sprouts appetizer which was divine with pear.  The house sake was good, however, a little expensive.  I would recommend as the food was very fresh."}
{"text":"The service and food was amazing! The sushi rolls and salt /pepper shrimp not only tasted perfect it was gorgeous to look at. I wish I wasn't being lazy and would have taken a picture."}
{"text":"Great entertainment value, but the food is very average. The emcee and server/dancers were awesome. The music is fun. The food is bland, and priced a little high, like you would expect on the strip. I'd suggest coming for a drink & entertainment, but skip the meal."}
{"text":"What a fun place!! Food is great, fun entertainment and crowd participation. Definitely do saki bomb!"}
{"text":"Really good. Staff here is great. Every one is so nice. I will make it a point to go here when I am back in Vages"}
{"text":"This was the most unexpected, amazing dinner I've ever had in Vegas. When told that we were going to a sushi place for our last dinner in Vegas, I was not expecting much.  Lo and behold it was dinner and an interactive show.   The food was delicious and upscale. The edamame had a real kick. I love spicy food so it was one of my favorite appetizers. Everything tasted fresh fresh, and the presentation was exquisite. This place also reminded me how much fun sake bombs could be.   Definitely plan to be there for a couple of hours because you might just be there for food, but you'll end up staying for the entertainment. The staff was very friendly and they allowed you to participate in the show. SO MUCH FUN!!!   PROPS to the DJ!!"}
{"text":"The service here was not great.   We arrived ten minutes before our reservation. Even though most of the tables were empty, we were told to wait until our time. My friend and I went to the bar and got some drinks, and expected the hostess to come get us when our table was ready. A minute after our reservation time, we walked back to the hostess and she asked us \"How can I help you?\" It seemed like she had already forgotten our faces in such a short time?  We were taken to our table on the second floor where a waitress was setting our table. She introduced herself as our waitress, and we sat down. We weren't given menus, and waited about ten minutes before we asked a random waiter passing by for a menu. He brought one to us, and we proceeded to wait even longer. I'm not sure how long we waited, but our waitress had not passed by again. We had to ask a random waiter if we would be able to order.   A waiter came by and apologized that there had been a mix up in the tables, and he took our order. (Confusing because our previous waitress had already introduced herself?). We ordered, and about five minutes later our original waitress came by apologizing, saying that she put in our order. Cool!  After waiting quite a while, eventually one sushi roll came out. My friend and I began to eat, when the waiter came by and apologized that our other sushi roll was taking a while. He offered free sake bombs to compensate for our trouble. Cool!  We took the free drink, and eventually our other roll came. The food was good, but a bit pricey. Food was a 4, service was a 2, average review is about a 3. The entertainment was interesting, lots of dancing!"}
{"text":"Can I give Sake Rok 10 stars?!? Seriously, this sushi spot has done it right! We had a large party but didn't feel like we had to wait due to that. We had Rich serving us and he was asked by a few people in our group to recommend some rolls and he was on point! Great entertainment while we were there! It's VEGAS so why not!? My wife and I already agreed every time we visit Vegas will be on our agenda at least once during our trip. The food was AMAZING! We had a large party which we kind of passed around our plates and tasted quite a bit of different items and WOW!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this spot so many times and I wish I had ventured in sooner. It's a party with good food and drink.  I started with a Sake Sangria that had a nice flavor and wasn't too sweet. The drink packed some punch and left me happy. For starters we shared Crispy Rice and Edamame (add garlic butter). The Crispy Rice was delicious and had the heat I craved. This was unexpectedly small compared to portions most restaurants serve for this starter. The Edamame was great and had a little kick to it.   Our main rolls were the El Chapo roll and Shrimp Tempura roll. Both were delicious, but small portions so I'd definitely order more next time. We wrapped up with Honey Toast which was very good. The server cut this open for us which made it easy to eat.   The atmosphere is very lively and closer to a party than a restaurant. It made for a fun dining experience. The staff worked together wonderfully to make sure we had everything we needed. It was excellent service."}
{"text":"The entertainer that was there last night was one of the most fabulous and gorgeous Queens I've ever seen. He knew the exact line between engaging the audience and keeping people feeling comfortable. He was quick witted, an excellent dancer, and basically I would have paid him to hang out with me for the night. He deserves his own 5 star review.   As for the food, it was really tasty, small portions, Vegas stupid prices (but standard). My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed what we ordered - we can't remember the name of our favorite roll but think it was called \"diablo.\" We left full and had 3 rolls and an app.  For the drinks, we were very excited about the sake flights. This is a must! They're house sake is excellent.   Our service was also great! Our server even joined in the dance at one point and shredded up the corner of the restaurant. Also, special shout out to the second server helping us. He was from our home town of San Diego and very friendly and attentive. To the Managers reading this: every one I just mentioned deserves a bonus."}
{"text":"Holyyyyyyy molyyy! If there's a place on the strip I'd recommend to try, it'd definitely be Sake Rok. Tourists and locals alike--Sake Rok is a restaurant you MUST visit at least once.   Sake Rok is fun. It's vibrant. It's lively. It's delicious. It's just overall a great place to be. If I wanted to recommend a place to be for an occasion, Sake Rok would be perfect.   The staff break out in song and dance every now and then. There's an MC (shoutout to Jonnis--I love you and you're amazing) who interacts with the guests and really makes the place alive. If you're lucky, you may even get pulled up to dance :)  Food - 5/5 I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the food here. There's definitely a unique touch to it, such as the edamame and the peppers you're given in the beginning. The sashimi tastes fresh and melts in my mouth. The sushi rolls were all amazing! I had one dish that involved mushrooms & steak and it was ah-may-zingggg. Overall, all loved the food!  Drinks - 5/5 Okay the cocktails are typical strip price so don't be scared. It tastes amazing. The staff really gave me great recommendations, drink after drink!  Staff - 5/5 I really can't complain. Everyone was helpful and friendly while also being energetic and fun :)  I highly recommend giving Sake Rok a visit! The food, the drinks, the staff, it's all amazing! Great energy, great time. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing spot!!! Sushi tasted light and fresh. I liked that the rolls had less rice and more meat~ excellent!!! Much different than what I've normally had. Cool decor, friendly service. We went during the day, but looks like this place would be a lot of fun at night!! Check em out if your in town~"}
{"text":"The service was awesome our waiter gave great suggestions was helpful. The show host was awesome. We celebrated a 21st Birthday there. Included birthday girl into celebration. All and all experience was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"$10 for a 16oz margarita of your choice at the outdoor bar; what a steal for Vegas prices on the Strip!    There were three flavors but I opted for the mango flavor! It was slightly on the sweet side but the drink sure had a good kick to it. It was a nice alcoholic beverage to enjoy a few hours before my flight home. There is plenty of outdoor seating around Sake Rok which is adjacent to the T-Mobile Arena.  I didn't get to dine here but I definitely will on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Not a big Shushi guy but the atmosphere was very cool lots of entertainment with good drinks."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! Make sure to check your itemized bill before leaving the restaurant because I got overcharged ~$354.   Also, take note that even though you have items that are \"comped/adjusted\" you will still have to pay the 22% gratuity.  I really hate to do this because I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and have also been a manager, but the 1 star is for how the servers and management dealt with my bachelorette party of 23 people (only 20 people were able to consume alcohol).  I had an issue with my bill and it only got \"somewhat\" fixed after a month of emailing and calling the restaurant.  Here's the story...as soon as we got seated a server told us that we'd be getting a round of sake bombs for free,  I thought, wow that's awesome.  About halfway into dinner my friend said that he was gonna order another round of sake bombs.  I told him to make sure to only order 20 sake bombs because we have people in our party that don't drink alcohol or are pregnant (note: we didn't get carded by our servers which I think is a big no no since we had some guests who had just turned 21 and our servers would have realized that they were handing out supposedly \"comped sake bombs\" to pregnant women). When it was time to pay our bill, I asked our server if she could split it up with food on 1 bill, and alcohol divided by the 3 tables (total = 4 checks).  She kept on telling me that she can't do that because the max number or checks she could do is 4.  I was confused because I was just asking for 4 checks but let it go because we wanted to leave the restaurant already.  I paid the food bill and my other friend paid the alcohol bill.  After we had left the restaurant we were trying to figure out who owed what for the alcohol and realized that Sake Rok had charged us for two rounds of 25 sake bombs (50 sake bombs) even though we had only ordered 20 sake bombs.  And our server did not \"comp\" our first round.  After about a month of emailing management (and not getting a response half the time) I came to the conclusion that our server thought we had ordered a \"set\" menu which includes a free round of sake bombs.  Sake Rok ended up comping the sake bombs in the end but I, the bachelorette, got left with paying the 22% gratuity for the \"comped\" sake bombs (~$66) when we only had a party of 20/23 people that could drink and dealing with all the stress of contacting the restaurant when this wouldn't have happened if our server hadn't made the mistake of, first, not carding us and realizing only 20/23 guests would consume a \"comped sake bomb\" then probably realizing that we didn't order a set menu and had us pay for the bill anyway.  Management offered to reimburse me for the $66 gratuity for the \"comped\" sake bombs but told me it would take awhile because they would have to ask for the money back from the servers, which I think the restaurant should have reimbursed me the $66 without any hesitation.  Sake Rok really needs to make sure they ID all their guests, know how many people are in each party AND if all the guests want/can drink alcohol.  Most importantly make sure that when they offer \"comped\" drinks, that they \"comp\" it."}
{"text":"SAKE ROK.....SAKE BOMB!!!!!! This place is off the chains!!! They have Almost their entire staff performing songs every now and again and it's a sushi Restaurant....so awesome. The entertainment here alone is worth the 5 stars on Yelp!   They have a ton of fancy schmancy drinks here you can buy. We got the 80oz beer set which came with 80 oz of Kirin in this tiny stainless steel keg and a couple of bottles of sake! Sake Bombs!!!!!  Appetizers here was also bomb too. The tacos are really small but it was delicious. May have to order a few plates for tacos. We had a party of 6, so we ended up with 4 orders which made it 12 pieces of tiny Ahi tacos. The pork belly was WOW! Lots of flavor and super tender.   Our group also ordered the Godzilla platter which I believe was chefs choice. The selection here was okay and for $200 didn't seem worth it. You'd be better off with order individual rolls instead. I think it's that pricey because you get a huge Godzilla platter with a freakish scary Godzilla on it. Lol!   Like most people have said here on Yelp, if you're looking for a quiet place to eat sushi, don't come here. But if you wanna have some fun while eating sushi this place should be on your bucket list!  SAKE ROK.....SAKE BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience. Visiting Vegas for the first time and we came here our first night. So energetic and exciting. Loved the *NSYNC versus Backstreet Boys faceoff. Host was LIT! Perfect way to start our vacation. Food was great and the sake bombs were amazing. This is a must visit if you're in Vegas for any occasion."}
{"text":"I came to Vegas for a girls trip this past weekend and was looking for a good sushi bar. We found Sake Rok on yelp and decided to try it out. This was the most fun we had on our trip, hands down. From the amazing customer service, to the perfectly crafted cocktails and fresh delicious food I couldn't complain about a single thing. The staff was so friendly and fun they made you feel like family! Our group was offered a free round of sake bombs and shortly after the staff performed to Madonna's Vogue! I can't wait to go back, I definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place will give you 100% amusement! Seafood is so fresh and there're cute dancing shows from all servers during your meal. A lot of good rolls to pick and Honey Toast is yummy."}
{"text":"There are a million places to eat in Vegas. We chose this one for the Sushi entertainment and also because their website listed Sunday as \"1/2 off Sake\". We were a party of 6 and when we were seated, I told our server that we wanted the Sake that was on special for \"Sake Sundays.\" She told me that is no longer an offer and I informed her it was still on their website. After checking with someone, she came back and told me they would honer it although its no longer offered. She also suggested the \"chefs special\" at $85/pp which we ordered. Long story short, we ordered several bottles of sake and left there with a $1200 bill. They charges us full price for our drinks. I tried to contact them to speak with a manager but they have not return my call.   The food was good. Entertainment was ok. Dishonest service was unacceptable. I wouldn't recommend this place and wouldn't go back.   PS: Their Sake special is still listed on their website."}
{"text":"Love this place. Came here on a sat night with my boyfriend. We are in town from Los Angeles and had a great time. Attentive and awesome customer service, food was delicious, entertainment was on point, dj played all the hits. I will definitely be coming back and look forward to the opening of more locations!!"}
{"text":"Not great sushi. Granted, it's on my for ordering fish in a land locked state, but I was expecting something really great since it's a huge destination spot. The sushi was really rough though and the miso soup was 99$ salt, 1% water/ tofu/seaweed. The tempura shrimp appetizer was okay but did not save the meal whatsoever. The sushi was just not great. The service was also very slow. Some tables came and went before I received my soup. The only star was for the waiter - although he was very slow, he was really nice. ***I would not recommend to a friend***"}
{"text":"Great food but horrible service. One drink throughout dinner.. no refills not even asked if we'd like more water.. water.. so I'm over this place and it's 22$ rolls in sitting here waiting to pay a bill they're to busy to collect"}
{"text":"Great food and the singing, entertainment and dancing by the staff was great.  Sitting upstairs was great.  We could see everything, but wasn't smack in the middle.  I used OpenTable but I also liked that they called to confirm the reservation."}
{"text":"What a cool spot!! We went in to celebrate my husband's birthday in a party of six. The entertainment was on point, with singing and dancing to some great 90's tunes.  They took quite a while to bring out drinks, and we were all ready to drink so that was a bit of an oversight on their part. Service overall was not constant, other than the water boy who kept us hydrated (appreciate that in Vegas!)  The sushi was good, and drinks were great. We even did sake bombs at the end, which was fun with the way they do it.  I would definitely come to this place again!"}
{"text":"The place look amazing The menu is very unique I enjoyed The service here everything was very fresh and very good"}
{"text":"Sake Rok is amazing! We got the tempura roll, the pork chop and honey toast. Best food I've probably ever had. The pork chop was amazing! The staff is so friendly. You get dinner and a show. If you like to have fun and want some delicious food, go! Place find in Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"Will never return to this restaurant again. (For the record, dined here in June 2016, food was ok but not spectacular). This review is regarding the staff and service. My husband and I made a 9:00 reservation and a few minutes before 9:00 called the restaurant to let them know we were running about 5-10 minutes late. The hostess on the phone then promptly informed us that we wouldn't be seated due to a private event taking place that evening. We reached the restaurant itself just a minute or two later and asked to speak to the manager on duty. He offered to seat us but said in so many words that we would be kicked out within an hour to make room for the private party. When at that point we pointed out that either we should have received a call beforehand notifying us of the schedule conflict, or that a 9:00 reservation should not have been given out in the first place, he had no explanation. He simply said to come back tomorrow night and he would \"take care of us.\" Whatever that means. No discounts, coupons, or incentives offered for us to return to the restaurant besides this likely entirely BS promise. Bottom line, you have hundreds upon hundreds of fabulous restaurant choices in the Las Vegas strip, so any restaurant arrogant enough to not work to earn your business doesn't deserve it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday, the place is beautiful, service was great and the reviews were pretty good, that's why we came.  The food, however, was really lacking.  The edamame with garlic and Ponzu was excellent but the tiger roll, el chapo roll and the cucumber salad were not good.  I wish I could give a better review  I expected more out of Vegas sushi."}
{"text":"So I was in town for the Rammstein concert, and wanted to get a bite to eat, but didn't want to have to walk 3,500 miles to find something decent. Luckily for me there was a food court right next door to the arena and that had a sushi place.  Now, I'm all about the sushi. And I do like a place with good ambiance. And this place seemed to fit the bill. So I went inside and was promptly seated.  The interior of the place is very trendy and hip looking and they had a DJ playing some decent tunes.  my waiter came by and I ordered a double Maker's Mark on the rocks.  The sushi seemed reasonably priced, until I was informed that the price for was one piece of sushi not two, which seems to be the industry standard. But I figured this is Las Vegas, industry standards do not apply.  So I ordered the least expensive roll on the menu, and five pieces of sushi. Let me say this, the food was good but the portions were really tiny. I thought I was in one of those high-end New York restaurants where they give you food that is about two clicks above microscopic.   That being said, the flavors were there, the presentation was top-notch, and the service was impeccable. I still have a hard time swallowing $5 a piece for sushi nigiri unless King Neptune himself brought it up, cleaned it and served it to me. Then I could have justified the cost. Sadly, Neptune was nowhere to be found, so I just have to chalk this one up to experience.  When the bill came after adding in tip, I walked out of there a little over $70 lighter, and I was still hungry. I have to figure that being next to an arena, restaurants can command a higher price. But there's a difference between a higher price, and boutique charging. I guess if you're trying to weed out a certain clientele, the price justifies the means.  Just to clarify one last time, the food was really good the service was impeccable and the place definitely had a great atmosphere. But damn, $5 minimum per piece of sushi nigiri seems way out of line to me.  I just can't in good faith give this place four or five stars.  The bottom line? If you are absolutely dying for some sushi, and you have nowhere else to go, this may be the only game in town around the T-Mobile Arena."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere and the food presentation was bitchin. Lots of unique rolls and great veggie sides. No sake bomb this time!"}
{"text":"You can expect GREAT quality sushi, GREAT customer service and really fun entertainment. It's not a quiet intimate dining experience it's more like going to a bar and they're serving bomb sushi. Oh and like every other review ... order the HONEY TOAST for dessert."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere-so Vegas! We had a great time and the sushi was out of this world! The host and DJ were amazing. Might not be your cup of tea if you are on the shy side...or they might just break you of that."}
{"text":"We just flew back into town and were hungry. This place was located next to the hotel so we thought we would give it a try. I'm glad we did.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is we both walk away hungry. The portions are small and expensive.  However, the food was outstanding so it earned the stars for that. Oh and the price is worth the entertainment! You not only eat yummy food but the music and ambiance is great. Also your servers dance and sing and are very entertaining.   Will we go back? We probably would for the entertainment but we will come less hungry."}
{"text":"What a fun place. Greeted by the wandering emcee, whose conversation with diners is broadcast over the never-ending music.   Menu is varied and very interesting.  We are vegetarian and they have a number of choices and a separate vegan menu.  We ordered four items for a late meal.  Perfect. Small portions, but there is noting conventional about this restaurant or its menu, so it was fine.  The tasting portions were unique, full of flavor and just fit the ambiance. Sake bomb at half of the tables.  Suddenly, all of the servers are lip-syncing and dancing, led by the emcee and boy band music videos. A little pricey, but it's Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The worst place in Vegas I have been to in my 22 years of visiting. Walked in to a less than half empty dining room. Sitting for a few minutes before I am asked what I am drinking. Another five minutes before I get the hot tea that I ordered. After the third hillbilly horse 5#!t song, I ask whoever is near me if they are going to play this garage all night. They advised it is up to the DJ. After the fourth round of the worst noise I have ever heard in a restaurant, I stand up and convey my disbelief that the staff are made to listen to nonsense at such obnoxious levels to the chef on the other side of the counter. As I am standing I ask the same chef where I can get change since no one has been around to take my order in the first place. I suffered through 3.5 rounds of the DJs finest and was ready to leave. I dropped a $20 and walked out not having touched a thing. I paid to leave this review."}
{"text":"Lots of fun and great energy! The food is terrific and the atmosphere is a blast. Great for large groups."}
{"text":"Warning: this place plays loud club like music and it's not traditional sushi. Overpriced also."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the music was SO loud (I guess I am too old for this crowd...) We had the ROK roll, the Tiger roll, and the Peter Parker roll. We also tried the salt fried shrimp appetizer. The food is fine and a little on the pricey side but it's on the Strip so we knew that coming in. We just didn't know music would be blasting the whole time. A lot of 90s music with random performances by the servers. I am not young nor hip enough for this kind of scene anymore, hahaha."}
{"text":"Fancy overpriced sushi. I felt rushed the entire evening by our server. What kind of restaurant tells their patrons they only have a table for a brief period of time."}
{"text":"This place is great! We love the murals on the walls, the live entertainment, the music genre and the food! We enjoyed the Wagyu sliders, Rok n roll and their speciality drinks especially \"asking for trouble\". Definitely a must try. I don give many 5 stars by this one nailed it. My boyfriend and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sake Rok not only had great food but also had awesome entertainment! Carlos and Vince were exceptional! We will definitely be going back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed... wanted something light for a late lunch so decided to stop by and give this place a try.  The decor and lay out is attractive, but the flavors of the food was lacking. There were only probably 5 other customers while we were there and it still took about 20 minutes to receive our food after we had ordered.  Rok Ceviche - Average. Just small fresh cuts of sashimi plated fancy. Add some shoyu and plate it differently and you can call it a mixed poke appetizer.  Rok & Roll - Presentation was really nice, but the roll tasted bland. The yuzu soy foam was a nice touch, but I wish it was ontop of the roll rather than in the middle of the dish.  Spicy Samurai - Not spicy. Looks prettier than it tastes because of the chili threads. Same bland taste as the rok & roll.   Add two beers with this order and $100 later, we were on our way. I'm sure the night time vibe is completely different"}
{"text":"The entertainment and food were great but both my girlfriend and I received food poisoning.... from something at the restaurant. It's unfortunate as the entertainment and everything about the restaurant was wonderful."}
{"text":"Upon arriving we got to the restaurant as soon as they opened and they were still putting the furniture outside. There was 2 couples ahead of us and the hostess told us she would sit us in 5 minutes. Weird....she then came back and told us there was only one server that's why she was waiting to seat us. She was very nice and did apologize for having us wait. Once in the restaurant I was very impressed with the decor. Very pretty! Our server Corina was really nice! She explained the menu very well. We came during lunch time and did the all you can eat. Overall the food was delicious, service was great and the ambiance was pretty! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was unreal! Best time at a restaurant! Great food, fun performances and memories made! We brought a group of 18 people on a Saturday night and not only were they able to accommodate our large group, they also let us split all the checks we wanted! Our waiter was just the best ever! So understanding and willing to have a good time with us!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a light lunch and was surprised by the sweet eager staff and super modern Tokyo artsy open space feel. Unfortunately, though our server appeared well meaning, the staff was not thoroughly trained as one would hope and our order came out without the side of rice and my cocktail had to be made multiple times. Though I am appreciative of the bartender in this case because he clearly didn't want to send out a bad Lily Pad. Still, it seems they have a bit more work to go. The wagyu sliders were delicious, the fish was fresh and tasty, and I really enjoyed my seaweed salad. The pork dumplings deserve special mention though I really wish they were either bigger or came with a couple more. The portions are tiny even for a sushi place."}
{"text":"Went here because it was close to the concert we had tickets for at 8. Arrived at 6:30 and were promptly seated. It was then we realized this just isn't a restaurant it's a bachelorette party with sushi. Ok if that's what you're looking for in a dining experience. The food was excellent, the prices high and the service poor. Maybe our waiter was new or just having a bad night but whatever the reason we had poor service. Lost 1/2 our order, food came out sporadically and even got our beer order screwed up. I did notice the three bachelorette parties got a lot of attention and seemingly great service. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Great food! They are kinda slow and cheap on sauces. You have to eat everything INCLUDING rice for the all you can eat plates!"}
{"text":"Had a friends bachelorette dinner there on Saturday! My sister found them listed as a inexpensive place and had good reviews for sushi so we thought it'd make a great spot to celebrate! We walked in and it was amazing, we were not disappointed! They had a host who walked among the tables, his crazy hair and make up but he is the entertainment. He was fun and light spirited! Made our table of girls laugh and dance. The servers all danced and participated in choreography to the most amazing songs! Our server was amazing she was sweet and took her time with us. There was always someone refilling our drinks taking away plates without us asking for anything. I don't really eat sushi too much, so it was a bit of a struggle for me to eat here. But I ordered the shrimp tempura roll and it was delicious. I tried a tempura roll that had salmon but it wasn't my kind of dish, I'm not a seafood person but the rest of the table enjoyed everything we ate. We ordered a shareable punch called the Pink Pagoda and it was amazing, we shared it amongst the ladies. It came in a huge fish bowl bucket to drink. We also tried the Godzilla platter it took alittle longer to make (definitely expensive) but the Waggu was amazing, it was uber delicious and should be shared, literally 42 oz of meat! I wish I remembered our servers name she took such amazing care of us. I highly recommend this restaurant, it's fun, it's great energy, the staff and host were amazing. The food was good... the drinks were bomb. We couldn't have enjoyed ourselves any better than we did there. And they take reservations for parties."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an amazing experience here on Friday after watching the USA Basketball game right next door at the new T-Mobile Arena. When we arrived we decided to eat at the bar and found two seats in between a few people already sitting at the bar. You always know what kind of vibe a place has by the type of people it attracts and the people we sat next to were awesome! They were friendly, fun, and by the middle of the our dining experience we were all sharing shots of Sake! The service was on point! The food was phenomenal! And right when we were finishing up our plates - an energetic performance started to take place throughout the restaurant, right in the main dining area. Overall, Sake Rok was a great experience that we will always remember! If you're in Vegas you should definitely check this place out for lunch or dinner while you're here!"}
{"text":"Nice venue - staff was somewhat aloof, catering more to a younger crowd, making service so-so. Sushi was actually well made with fresh ingredients and was worth the wait. We went early to beat the dinner rush and wondered if some of the vegetable dishes were a little undercooked,  even by Japanese standards. All in all a fairly decent experience -"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Saturday at 11am right when they opened.  Very nice atmosphere and decor, and pretty quick service. The all you can eat options are a bit deceiving and confusing, but not horrible. They food was good but not great, it was within walking distance to our hotel though.  With so many other options in Vegas, not sure we will make it back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great!! So much fun! Went on a Saturday night before our show. I love sushi. The rolls were kinds thin but I don't eat much anyway. They had a ring master who was super fun and friendly. I'd come back for the experience alone. Maybe for a small bite n some drinks. Definitely worth bringing friends"}
{"text":"Sake Rok is a restaurant you won't forget. They have a unique atmosphere and unique food! Whenever I go there I have to get the drink called \"Asking For Trouble\". The sushi is impeccable especially the yellowtail that they have. I would also suggest getting the edamame and peppers they serve. This place is great and not to mention the MC is hilarious. I would give it 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I will never go to Vegas again without going here. The atmosphere is absolutely incredible. The staff is amazing and they really know how to put on a good show. Plus, the sushi is delicious!!!! This is seriously a secret gem of Vegas and you should definitely add it to your agenda if you're planning a trip!"}
{"text":"A dining experience unlike any other. The service, well not only do they serve you food, but they dance and perform every 10-15 minutes. They interact with the diners as they do it. A super fun dining experience. I went with my husband, but I think it would be even more fun to go with large groups. The food is awesome, though pricey. We got some oysters, one king crab leg, a couple of rolls (Tiger roll and tuna roll), and a side of brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious!! I loved the atmosphere and want to go back for my birthday or anniversary."}
{"text":"My first visit might be my last. The restaurant was inviting but the prices were not.  I alao did no care for the service."}
{"text":"I am echoing the sentiments of Christina L. below as I was also a part of that party.  To say this was a simple mistake that they \"forgot\" to put our order in really doesn't sit well with me, I'd understand after 15-20 minutes of sitting there with nothing being delivered but this went on for an hour.  If the staff was even remotely attentive (drinks had to be ordered twice) someone would have caught on relatively quickly, I honestly don't remember seeing our server again after placing my order.  At the point that we were just being tossed whatever food they had at the ready (none of it was what anyone ordered) it was obvious to us that we needed to leave.  After just arriving in Vegas, getting all dressed up for our first night on the town, we chose this restaurant to set our 4 day adventure off right...  but instead we walked out angry, frustrated, insulted and a bit embarrassed.  Whether the restaurant management would like to admit it or not, the treatment of our respectably dressed Crossdressing group came across as Extremely Discriminating!  To send the entertainer to apologize and talk to us, not the management itself is simply unacceptable.  NOT the way we wanted to start our week!  Our Annual gathering accounts for over 300+ people from 9 countries, as organizers we help all the newer girls (as well as the veterans) with recommendations of restaurants, shows, etc... I see no reason why Sake Roks would ever make that list, not after how mistreated we felt.  As for the food...  after spending an hour and a half in this establishment I have no idea how anything taste."}
{"text":"I will start by saying this is overpriced Vegas sushi. Not a place with traditional sushi, more hip trying to impress the people that want to like sushi cause it's popular than traditional sushi. Now if you want good service and some entertainment while you eat this is the place to go. The staff was there to give you a show and they did a great job. And don't get me wrong I still liked my meal just not normal sushi."}
{"text":"While the night started a little rough, Jones (?) came and took care of us making the night amazing. He didn't believe me when I said I'd post this. But it's the least I could do. Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"SERVICE WAS THE WORST BY FAR! Went there on a Wednesday and had a reservation at 945 (last seating was at 1030), as we were walking to our table, one of the servers cut me off and I had to stop to get out of her way.  The server that cut me off was our server as well.  She wasn't friendly, forgot my boyfriends drink two times and my drink was delivered to the wrong table. (She watched from the bar as the person questioned if it was my drink) she wasn't sorry for the service thus far. We got our food and never checked on us one time to see how things were. just before we were done I realized I wanted to order more but before I could we were handed a bill.  I let her know I wasn't done and she said that the kitchen was already closed. The only thing good about this place is the ambience, but def not worth a dime! Ps her name is Jennifer"}
{"text":"This is a must try in Vegas.    Five star service from Vincent and Carlos.   There hospitality was a five star.  My wife and I came out for a concert at the T-mobile Arena and wanted to eat at place that was elegant.  The atmosphere here is really relaxed.   I know every time I come back to Vegas I'll come back each time at a minimum to sample a different roll.     We started off with Edename Rok, this Edename is off the hook.  So full of flavor with the secret spice that is added.  Not your average Edename Rok.  LOVED it!!!!!  We tried the Girl on the beach roll, loved it.     Had the Dry Aged New York Strip, so good.  Full of flavor.   For dessert we had the Honey Toast, best dessert that we have tried.   A definite must try for those in need of dessert.i"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here and had the best time ever! Food was yummy, service was amazing and the environment was so fun! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, Great sushi for descent prices, well for the Vegas strip. The flavors are well balanced, and just delicious. I can't remember all the rolls, but the one that stood out was the \"El Chapo\" roll. Thin sliced lemon, shrimp, and a hint of cumin, or at least I thought that's what it tasted like. The place is hispter'ish with dim lighting. Hostess were very nice, the waiter not so much, otherwise this place would have received five stars. All in all, really great sushi!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi & Scenery combo in Vegas hands down. Really awesome spot to go before events at the T Mobile areana especially."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing staff, amazing service!! Awesome entertainment, the DJ was on point. Definitely try the tiger roll and the tempura roll. Rok Shrimp tempura (for appetizer) was super good but spicy, incase you're not into that. Hanger steak was cooked to perfection. I would recommend this place hands down!!!"}
{"text":"This place is Fun!  Music, great ambiance and fantastic food!  Went in without reservation, hostess was very friendly and told us that was going to be 20 minutes for a table so we went to the bar.  Bartenders were busy playing around didn't pay much attention to my group.  In about 10-15 minutes we were being called by the hostess which showed us to our table.  Server was cool and very accommodating with our requests.   Will def. be back when I go to Vegas again"}
{"text":"It was okay.  I didn't get sick from it or send anything back.  The highlight was the appetizer of Shishito Peppers. It had a mild lime sauce on them.  I could eat those all day.  The bummer: the sushi.  It was just okay. Presentation was beautiful and the flavor was very middle of the road I'm sad to say.  I might give this place another chance when I'm in Vegas for the cooked items."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 6 for my 30th birthday dinner during our trip to Vegas this last week. It's a little hard to find, but we enjoyed walking through the New York hotel and casino to do so!   This is quite the experience, and something we will all remember! From the dancing geisha to the DJ and the dancing servers, they certainly made this a special event for my birthday night!   I will say the menu is a bit exotic and takes a minute to figure out before ordering. Pretty pricy, but to be expected for the strip. Everybody had something different, myself, I love sushi so of course I ordered two rolls, which were amazing. Our table service was a little hit and miss, but didn't take away from the overall experience. Definitely something to check out while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my most favorite places to eat in Vegas! So much fun! Boy band mash ups, sake and sushi... what more could a girl ask for? Definitely recommend the ROK shrimp and the roasted cauliflower."}
{"text":"Went earlier during the day so no performances or anything but the venue and atmosphere were beautiful. Our waiter(s) were very attentive and upbeat and helped us take about 10 sake bombs without hesitation lol. (Waiters we're young Asian man with blonde hair and taller guy wth goatee and black hair with accent). The only downside I have was when we ordered my group of 3 decided to go with one of the \"deals\" located on the large menus. You can choose from two appetizers, entrees, dessert etc for $55, $70 depending on whatever deal you chose. We picked the $55 deal which came with more than enough delicious and well prepared food for the 3 of us, however, unbeknownst to us was that the deal was per person instead of collectively as a group which was not listed. We had no problem paying, however, it would have been nice if that was clarified prior or at least during our visit."}
{"text":"Listen this gem is the best place to go for entertainment and amazing sushi and sake bombs. Every server is talented , singing and dancing . I had no idea we would get such an amazing show with our equally amazing food. I got the tiger roll and it was perfect . We also got the pork potstickers and cucumber salad . Perfection in"}
{"text":"Probably the most fun dining experience I've had on the strip in YEARS!  From the minute you walk in, you feel like you've wandered into a post apocalyptic cirque du soleil set. Greeted by adorable hostesses, and met at your table by someone that's a cross between Chris Angel and someone from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, dinner at Sake Rock is an adventure, and NOT for the entitled shallow-hearted.   Ginormous cartoon-sized menus, boy band sing-a-longs, interactive diner participation complete with spankings (yes I was spanked....... and it was SOOOOOO delicious!), dancing waitresses (and they were GOOD dancers..... like holy-shit good!), wonderful singers...... ah the fun!  If you're uptight, boring, and have the personality of a bumper sticker, do yourself a favor, DON'T come! Stay home! Go find an all-you-can-eat buffet and smirk under your right-wing Stetson. Stay far away! They don't want you here!  Now.... the food is interesting. Some of the traditional sashimi is average to pretty good. They deliver. Then you move up the creative chain and sample the mixed rolls.... and if you have enough people, get the Godzilla platter, which comes out like champagne bottle service at Hyde or Hakassan nightclubs. This is Vegas-level sushi table service, complete with smoke-spewing Godzilla statue.  If you're a scallop lover, omg they have an amazing cooked scallop dish that led some of the people in my party to fight.   If you're a meat eater, you MUST try their Flintstones-sized bone-in ribeye that is good for 5-6 people. Holy cow..... pun intended.... amazeballs.   They have a full bar, and their array of cocktails will do any mixologist proud. I actually let my waiter decide for energize on the table simply based on 2-3 question about what we like or dislike. Winning!  So come here if you're looking for dinner fun. I'm rating the entire experience and \"smile\" factor. It is so much fun!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was great and the entertainment was awesome! Overall a great night out. Watching everyone do sake bombs was pretty funny as well."}
{"text":"I had a late flight back home so the boyfriend and I decided to squeeze in a quick date night before I left, as he was leaving a few days later. He chose this place and overall things were great. We seemed to have like 5 different servers, people were constantly coming to make sure we didn't need anything; everyone was very attentive. Our food was really good, but a few things we wished would have been listed on the menu, neither were a huge deal. For the king crab cali roll, it was not listed that the crab was actually a crab salad. We were expecting just a piece of crab inside, not a mayo based mixture. We both hate mayo. Also the brussel sprouts were coated in some type of breading. Not tempura. Either way, they weren't listed as breaded on the menu. We would've skipped both of these items had it been described as such. The sake was good also and they had a dj who was really good. Problem is, it was like 5pm and the music was so loud it was comical. I get it, it's saturday, it's vegas. But it's 5pm. Also there was only one other table besides us. So we just got to yell at each other. Either way it was fun. Loved the decor as well!"}
{"text":"This place just opened so we stopped by to have lunch for my birthday today. We walk in and apparently they close after lunch and reopen for dinner at a certain time, which is not posted anywhere on their menu or on this app. They only offer parts of the menu during this inbetween lunch and dinner period. My gf and I decided to sit down and try it anyway even though we wouldn't be able to order from the full menu. We were hungry and in the mood for sushi.   Garlic edamame - oily and bland; didn't think edamame was a hard dish to execute, but I guess it can be for some $7   1 piece of tako nigiri - 1 piece for $5. Nothing special. Tasted like typical tako nigiri. Again.. 1 frickn piece.   Salt and pepper shrimp - this dish was tasty; shrimp was cooked nicely and had a nice crisp to it - $14  Tuna tataki - delicious; most places never go wrong with this dish; made with ponzu sauce $15  Westside Roll - this roll had different ingredients, but was tasty as well; surprising ingredients included Asian pear and a peanut curry sauce $18 for 6 pieces.... Seriously 6 pieces   The food overall was for the most part tasty, but honestly the prices are not worth the portions. I realize this restaurant is on the strip, but really for a more reasonable price you can get tasty sushi many other places in Vegas. The ambiance was unique and the restaurant has a cool vibe.   Also, being that we were one of two parties in the restaurant at the time, service was pretty slow. I also realize this restaurant just opened and perhaps the are still getting things situated and organized, but management who have their shit together usually translate into staff having their shit together.   Being from Hawaii I've eaten a lot of sushi and although most of the dishes were tasty, the prices were a bit steep in my opinion. Again, quality sushi can be found for much more reasonable prices in many other locations in Vegas... Like Sakana for example. I guess that's the price you pay for eating on the strip."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Monte Carlo over the past weekend and of course had a sushi craving so I yelped and found sake rok ! We were the first customers of the day beacuse they had just opened ! let me tell you... I eat ALOT of sushi and this is the best I have ever ever ever had!!! I can not rave about it enough. Craving it as I type this ! Also the service was amazing. Will be back each time I'm in Vegas 100 + stars"}
{"text":"We stopped in here because we wanted a light lunch and got exactly that. The place was practically empty when we came in so the perfect time to get in for lunch. We were greeted right away, the staff was very friendly and nice.   We ordered the Shishito Peppers - crispy garlic, lime, sea salt one of the most ordered items. Very taste and light every third or fourth one would be spicy to me but very delicious.   Then we just ordered two rolls because we did not want a lot so we shared the Kamikaze Roll - shrimp tempura, jalapeño, avocado, tuna, jalapeño vinaigrette, eel, sauce, lime juice, micro cilantro - this roll was amazing I thought it would be spicy but it was  not excellent combination great flavor.   The other Volcano Roll - eel, cream cheese, avocado, spicy kani & scallop, baked with spicy dynamite sauce - I thought his would have also been spicy was not, it was so delicious great mixture.   Would definitely love to try more rolls out next time where in town."}
{"text":"Vince and Josh set us up with some excellent rolls.  Go there.  Get sake and and have a good time!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks and fun show. The sushi can get pricey fast, but it was a nice change from other strip restaurants. The drinks were fantastic; of course they had the sake but the other drinks were quite yummy too. The show that goes along with your dinner was hilarious, certainly a good time. The servers were all very attentive as well"}
{"text":"Omg! This was place was amazing! Love that there was a DJ while eating sushi. If you order sake bombs the sake rok guy comes around and drinks one with the rest of the table and is very interactive. The servers break out in dance every now and then which was fun. They pulled my friend up to dance and sing with them! It's basically free entertainment. The sushi was amazing! If you go, ask about their fancy drink that arrives in a glass case with smoke coming out! Wish I could remember the name of it. You must try this place! I regret not getting any pictures!"}
{"text":"Amazing good and love the ambience of the restaurant. There was a drag queen going around tables and celebrating birthdays with the patrons for their birthday. It was fun to watch. Food was delicious and service was great!  I would recommend calling for reservations as we had a party of 2, but didn't get a table and was seated at the bar. When you're sitting at the bar, we had to continuously look back to watch and enjoy the show.  Other than that, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bravo to RILEY(is that the correct spelling?) He was wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. The place is trendy and new agey and hip so if you are twenty something you will love, love, love this place. The service is impeccable and the waiters are attentive, personable and fun. Shoutout to DJ he was pulling double duty but you couldn't even tell(kidding you totally could). The food was delicious and fresh. We had the tataki small bites late that was Delish-get chips with this otherwise they go by fast. I had sliders with liver and peppers on them, delish-also excellent.It's a sushi place so we had sushi too. The food is beyond reproach. It is excellent, excellent excellent! Go for the food before an event and you will not be too full to fall asleep-lol. Thumbs down for the gender neutral bathrooms. The bathrooms took a whole star away from this review. They need an attendant to control the follow of traffic and it's just weird conversing with a male bathroom attendant who is looking at you like-women talk in the bathroom??? Yes we do. You have to high tail outta there fast Incase your the weird one hanging in the girls bathroom I mean bathroom#fail.  Ambience is great until you need a makeup touch up. I would still recommend this place as a trial run wouldn't hurt-right? plus who knows-this is the future right?(shudders)"}
{"text":"We have tried to eat at this place 4 times now. There hostesses are rude and not customer friendly at all. We have come down for events at the T-Mobile arena and can never get into this place. An event gets over that started at 6pm and the entire crowd is hungry. This place closer there doors. It's impossible to ever get a seat."}
{"text":"Had to check this place out! Right in the heart of Vegas!! Gotta try the El Chapo roll!!"}
{"text":"Dinner and a show, and then another show! The sushi menu has a lot of creative variations on the standards. They serve their sake cold only, which I guess is fine... Also, they put sugar in the wasabi. All things considered, that might be a safety measure. No harm, no foul. And there's entertainment -- a DJ with a band of sorts and a geisha (who really put the gay in geisha). It was fun! Not what I was expecting (quiet place with samisen music) but what was I thinking? This is the Vegas strip! Of course it's not low key! One comment: the water tastes a little hinky - mineral... A small investment in a carbon filter would go a long way. But who the hell actually drinks water on the strip? Lol Spendy, but worth a go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The atmosphere has a really fun vibe and the place has some of the coolest decor Ive ever seen in a sushi joint.  Food presentation is also on point.  Definitely check out the Volcano Roll and the Tempura Roll.  Delicious!  Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"As you would expect the sushi was awesome ! But let's talk about the something you wouldn't expect from this place OMG the chicken ! I couldn't believe it I went to this place after reading about it in a magazine in Vegas so I thought I had to go while I was around the stadium. We had sushi salmon and varies rolls however what really got me gob smacked was the chicken. The chicken bokchoy literally was the most perfectly moist dish I've ever had with a crunchy outside, it just fell apart on my fork supplemented by a deep fired bokchoy they complimented each other just right."}
{"text":"Had a great time celebrating my sister and my nephew's birthday @ Sake Rok!! The staff and emcee were all awesome & made our first visit a memorable one. Will def be back again when we come to visit Vegas  Highly recommend!  PRUUUNNNE! (Caesar voice )"}
{"text":"We were not at Sake Rok during a peak time, it was for an early dinner, so only 2-4 other people were dining when we were there. I agree with another reviewer over the snooty hostesses but the one that seated us was nice enough. The place was over-staffed for it being so slow (probably ahead of a potential rush) but it appeared as though a lot of the staff were watching and talking about the diners. Even if they weren't, that's how it felt. Our server was nice and the kitchen was very accommodating to my allergy and double-checked that similar ingredients were alright for me. I greatly appreciated this attention to detail and the chefs even relayed some questions as well to make sure they prepared something I could eat. Our beverages were refilled often and our food took an appropriate amount of time to prepare. The coconut rice came out first and it was absolutely delicious. We'd hesitated in ordering a starter but I am so glad we ordered it. I'm still thinking about it! Our sushi rolls (Avocado, Tiger and I'm Filled With Cream) were all fresh and tasty. The ingredients were all evenly balanced within each roll. We weren't there during any of the live performances or aware they had them but did see one of the male performers in makeup on our way out. In short, the waiter, kitchen manager (?) and cooks were all great. 1 hostess was decent. The weird vibe was from the seemingly-gossipy other employees on the clock that may very well have just been bored. I'd still return. *this review posted on multiple sites"}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Sake Rok. I won't have too much to say about our experience her because it was far from great. First the menu thing is crazy. i want to have a conversation and discuss menu choices. too damn big IMO. I can't even remember the meal that well and the atmosphere was beyond my liking. I am not a fogey by any means but not my cup of tea. Josie was unimpressed and felt did not live up to the hype. I can see how this can be a fun place for tourists but for me not so much. They did have a good beer selection. It took us a while to get our drinks and felt like the staff more interested in each other than us. Maybe that is why food didn't stand out. When customer service is bad nothing else matters.  Thank you for coming to Sake Rok. Will not go back. Can't say it may not be for you but I was not impressed. Except for beer choices."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this restaurant. The decor is on point, music and energy also on point but I think that it was a tourist trap. First, the sushi rolls are so small and the order that they bring you the main course, the appetizers and drinks is way rude. You will feel rush to order so be prepared to know what you want and when you want it. And last, too expensive for those annoying things."}
{"text":"When a bunch of us girls from NJ headed to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party, we were looking for something unique, fun, and different to add to our schedule of events. Sake Rok, in itself, delivers the fun-in-Vegas special experience, even despite the hiccups here and there.  I'll start with the good. The atmosphere of this place is fantastic. It's got an edgey, J-pop/punk vibe that screams at you from the street - literally! More about this in a below, but basically, whatever is going on inside is broadcasted outside, on the pavilion, of  the restaurant.   Keep in mind, Sake Rok is not a peaceful dining experience. It's an interactive, energy-fueled improv and music show that involves every person in the room, so don't come here expecting anything less. Our host for the evening (Carlos) was HYSTERICAL and downright delightful. His fashion sense slayed, his dancing was on-point, and his jokes had us all in stitches. And the best part? He gets to DRINK SAKE BOMBS WITH YOU. He leads you into the battle of staying sober and looks fabulous while doing so. Overall, Carlos gets all the gold stars.   Even the service was pretty wonderful, despite the multiple waiters and waitresses weighing on you. Usually, I hate it when restaurants have the many-waiters thing, but everyone had their act together, and was super pleasant and funny.  Buuuuuuut I will say this. I daresay people come to Sake Rok just for the show, because in my opinion, the food (at least from our one experience) will definitely not be getting me in the door again. It's not that the actual food tasted bad (the little we had was delicious), it's just the fine details of our overall eating experience that missed the mark.  First of all, this place is overpriced, YET I can get over that. You're in a touristy section of Vegas, and the dining comes with entertainment, so what do you expect? I can totally forgive the high price tag that comes with the meal. (Again, thank you Carlos.)  The menu items were, at the time that we went, extremely limited, but it seems that the menu has changed in the few months since I been there. (I actually went to look at the website so that I could glance menu to remind myself of the options, and was surprised at the plentiful and different items available. For example, the slider small plates that a party member ordered came with foie gras - a weird and completely unnecessary topping, even for a fancy Japanese place. It appears that they have taken it off the menu.) Basically, our options were sushi rolls (personally, not a fan), a weird combination of carb-and-fish based small plates (also not a fan), and expensive entree options. Let's get real here. The place wants to be bougie and offer unique dining options, I get that, but you HAVE GOT to appeal to the masses somehow, even if it's ONE kitschy 'plain' dish. Things like oysters, tuna tartare, and grilled octopus are all great 'different' options, but are way too specific to appeal multiple palettes. And I wasn't about to shell out 40 bucks for a hangar steak. But, having said this, the menu has clearly changed since I've been there, so don't base your opinion solely on this.  STILL! I can forgive all that, just for the entertainment factor and vibe of this place. The real gamechanger is this. The real issue is that the portions were so pathetically small that we all ended up getting trashed because there was very little food in our stomachs. For a restaurant that literally encourages you to drink Sake Bombs, something's gotta give. There's needs to be more drinker-friendly options (not just sushi rolls and dumplings the size of quarters) and more 'available' options, too. One does not drink with sushi alone. Basically, the miniscule portions and limited options combined with the high price made our experience so-so.   If I ever return to this Vegas, I will give it another chance based on the new menu that I see on the website and entertainment factor. The decor and atmosphere of this place alone is amazing! Don't get me wrong - everyone in our party had a blast, but the food situation just brought the experience down. You can't have these crazy drink options and not have food to go along with it, it just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"The place has a great, eye-catching interior design. It is also located in a great spot on the park next to T-Mobile Arena to welcome all the foot traffic. The sake bomb is an experience no matter how small or large the reservation is. They hired a friendly and knowledgeable staff who also put on live dance shows later at night. Personal favorite dish on the menu - Toban Yaki."}
{"text":"I held a work event at Sake Rok and my group had a blast with the Karaoke machine. The service was great!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO FUN!! Definitely go if you are celebrating something like a birthday or bachelorette party as they will definitely make a deal out of it and make you feel special!   The food was also amazing! Some of the best sushi I've ever had!   I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that we asked TWO waitresses if the white wine sangria had pineapple in it (since someone in our party had a severe allergy) and they both said no. She proceeded to drink it until her mouth started feeling weird. She decided to go to the bar to ask and guess what....it had pineapple in it!!! Thank god she noticed quickly or that would've been a disaster!!"}
{"text":"The server was very attentive asking if there were any good allergies to which we told him gluten and chili, all things we ordered and asked if these were ok. We ordered 5 plates and from those 5 I could only eat one plate of sashimi. Waste of $120 when i had plain and clearly asked if these were void of the things I could not eat."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. My husband and i came here for my birthday dinner after seeing the good reviews here. We had a reservation and still had to wait for our table. So we got drinks at the bar while we waited. My husband let the bartender know it was my birthday, the bartender said he would let our server know about my birthday. Thats cool, although my husband already told them about my birthday when he made our reservation. When we got to our table we waited a good 5-10 minutes for the waitress. She said the hostess didn't let her know that we had sat down which is why it took her so long to take our order.   We ordered our food and ate it once it arrived. The food was good (but I think this place should be $$$ instead of just $$ because it was definitely on the pricier side). Meanwhile the DJ was going around to tables giving birthdays shots. He never came to our table. Our check arrived so my husband specifically told him again that it was my birthday and the server replied saying he would come back with a shot. He came back with just our processed credit card payment. At that point we had had enough.  I felt bad because my husband was trying to make my birthday special and told the restaurant multiple times about it, yet they didn't acknowledge it (but acknowledged it for others).  Between that, the slow service and the price, we definitely won't be recommending this place to friends. At least we had a great show after the disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"The beautiful well presented dishes to the fun loving enjoyable entertainment- you will not leave this place without a smile! The menu is classic yet eclectic, service is top notch , this is a must stop when in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Good sushi , interesting entertainment, loud but fun , not a place for a quiet dinner. A little high in price , I guess you are paying for the entertainment. At first I hated it because it was so loud, but once I got settled it was fun."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. CRAZY atmosphere with lots of singing, dancing and a DJ dressed as a Ninja that will come to your table several times. Its a lively environment but mostly a college type environment."}
{"text":"Last night on Mother's Day my best friends and I decided to go eat at Sake Rok since it was close to the hotel our friends were staying at. As a local in the industry and walking by the restaurant numerous times I was really excited to try this place. When we arrived the sad looking hostess (the young rude short blond hair) asked us if we had a reservation and we told her we didn't. Mind you no one was waiting and no one walked in while we were waiting for 10 minutes for a table to be put together which is totally fine because we had a table of 8. As we were patiently waiting, the hostess was giving us really mean looks that made us uncomfortable. She also turned to my best friend and told her she couldn't bring in a water bottle in the restaurant for her 3 year old child. The hostess then told us that, \"they started the music and people started dancing so it will be another 5-10 minutes to seat us.\" Just from the first impression we were not excited anymore and immediately left. We walked to Tom's Urban where we were seated immediately and spent over $500 on last nights dinner not including the generous tip we gave our awesome waiter! Sake Rok could have been a great experience if our hostess was more welcoming but maybe she should be in the back washing dishes if she can't seem to put a smile on her face and turn on her customer service skills. It's too bad really because our first impression made us immediately not interested in trying what could have been really great sushi in Vegas. Good luck, I can see why Mother's Day there was not a big hit."}
{"text":"Decent food, but a little on the pricey side for what you get. The staff is entertaining so that makes up for the extra money you're spending- come during the day for some all you can eat specials. If you come at night, expect a loud and crazy party! And 5 tiny pieces for your roll."}
{"text":"Have to say hands down best all around experience. Food with so much flavor and service on point. And ENTERTAINMENT  a must see!! Great energy food and SAKE BOMBS...."}
{"text":"Never really enjoyed sushi until I went here!!! Every single item we ordered was absolutely delicious and the entertainment was off the charts! We loved the tempura roll, volcano roll, rok ramen and tuna tataki, will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Service was good. I would go back for sure.   I ordered the Brussel sprouts and they were really yummy. But very rich and heavily sauced, which is great, just not what I was expecting.   Also I didn't realize that there is an MC and performance continuously going on during dinner. We are in Vegas so I should have known. The performers were talented and the MC was lovely but if you are trying to just grab a bite to eat with out theatrics be warned. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a company event. I guess perhaps people who are coming here know what they want and get that but I was not impressed. Not only was the food subpar (especially the sticky coconut rice) but the dancing was just a little odd and corny. I definitely would not come again especially given that there's got to be a million other restaurants that are much better than this in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Love the vibe and the food, you have to try the El Chapo Roll!! Perfect place if you are celebrating a bachelorette or birthday!!"}
{"text":"Out of town-ers looking for a good sushi spot. We have been to other sushi restaurants but nothing really special or great.   So we dined here Tuesday night for an early dinner since it was conveniently located near our hotel . EVERYTHING we ordered was AMAZING! Our server ( which I wish I remembered her name) gave us EXCELLENT recommendations, along with the other staff who was very helpful with refilling our drinks, and clearing plates! We ordered  -shishito peppers (usually not spicy but this bach was however, they were still flavorful and delicious) -maguro nigiri  -half doz oysters (west coast) -s&p shrimp which was AMAZING!  -crispy rice w/ spicy tuna which was also amazing !!! -el chap roll & westside roll very refreshing! -Asking for trouble cocktail BOMB!!!  small plates and rolls are reasonably priced!  My boyfriend and I are big sushi eaters and this place by far is up there on our new top favorite! We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not a place for a calm dinner or a nice date.... This is a place you go for an all out experience if you're out in Vegas celebrating something! We came before hitting the clubs for a bachelorette party and we had a blast. There is loud music and performances all night. I remember at one point our waitress said she would come take our order after she performed. Five seconds later she was being held up doing splits in mid-air.   It was a great place to kick off the night, and the $50 fish bowls might be on the pricier side but they were really good and had a strong kick to them. They also put a big sign up for the bachelorette and comped us sake bombs. So fun! So vegas lol"}
{"text":"Great experience....Jannis was great!! Wished performances were longer...will be back for more."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, sushi was on point but the prices were a bit iffy. The environment was pretty good, very cozy and the customer service was great too. I thought the menu was kinda awkward because it was huge and very inconvenient, kinda heavy too."}
{"text":"Sake Rok is nowhere second favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas,  I WILL be returning to this sushi restaurant.  The service was amazing,  the menu was more than accommodating and the sushi was absolutely perfect.  I like how they offer nice bottles of water,  the table is big enough to handle an assortment of sushi and appetizer and they make nice drinks from the bar too! I recommend Sushi Rok!"}
{"text":"Sushi Rok! You had such promise! You had a vegan menu, a cool atmosphere, funky tunes, pizzazz, and a drag queen hosting the space.  However, I have encountered the rudest service I've ever encountered. My friends and I were at the bar and decided to move to a table to better talk and eat.  The hostess was super sweet and had a table made for our party of 6. I'm assuming our \"server\" came over and we couldn't hear him and we didn't acknowledge him, but he rolled his eyes at us and just left.  At this time, a busser came over and dropped off waters, and my friend ordered a round of saki bombs for the table.  The waiter then came back and asked if we'd like anything to drink, my friend stated that she ordered it from the busser. He again, just walked away, and started talking about my friends and I to another server.  After this, we decided to head to the bar, close out our tab; then the waiter looked surprised when he went back to an empty table.  I get that doing your job in a loud place can be difficult, but this was ridiculous. It was a Tuesday and it wasn't even busy.  Thank you, but no thank you."}
{"text":"This place is Outstanding!!!! One of the best rolls I have eaten. The shrimp tempura roll. The performance the staff does is entertaining and they get everyone involved. This will be a must stop for every vegs trip."}
{"text":"VEGAS BABY!!!!!  About a year ago, I had a brief business lunch during my stay in the city of sin and conventions.  I was impressed with the quality of the food, the service and the decor.  This isn't your typical traditional sushi joint, where the decor makes you want to sleep.  I knew I had to come back and check it when the sun goes down and the sin city comes alive.  This past Saturday night, my friend Carlos was able to set up dinner reservations for Saturday night, for me and my lovely wife.  Figure we could have some drinks and delicious food prior to heading out to a nightclub.  Not only did we get to enjoy delicious food and drinks (One Night Stand Bombs are a must), but we also got a show.  You get to enjoy a interacting experience in which there is a DJ, the staff dances and performs.  I am going to embrace my millennia status and note that the place was LIT!!!  This is definitely the perfect place to come and have a great dinner prior to going out, or just make it your place to have fun the entire night.  Food wise \"El Chapo\" is a must and their delicious Tacos are the bomb.com  If you are in the city, this a must.  Other perks, are the location (right across the street from the T-Mobile Arena) and other cool bars to partake prior or before your time there.  Contact my buddy Carlos for reservations: instagram.com/carlitosway78."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place, but it was quite expensive. I know that's what to expect when on the strip. Honestly the only reason I'm leaving this because we all got sake bombs and one of us accidentally spilled it and we still got charged the drink. I get it, but if it were me I would have brought a replacement or not have charged. That may be too much to ask on the strip but that's just my opinion. Otherwise I suppose it was a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Original and tasted amazing. My only complaint would be the service (HORRIBLE). Had to remind the waitress to do her job several times and the water tasted like pool water. NASTY!"}
{"text":"Super fun place with a DJ spinning tunes.  MC is friendly and the place is lively with the servers dancing to music From Righteous Brothers to the boy bands.  Great fun.  The sake bombs are great and they have great drink specials for a large group.  The spicy edamame is outstanding and the sushi is above average.  Definitely the place for a group celebration."}
{"text":"This place is awsome. Food is hands down best in vegas. The whiskey drinks they have are to die for. And the staff is perfect couldnt ask for better"}
{"text":"I am at a loss as to why this place got raving reviews. The staff was so friendly and nice but this is the worst sushi I've had in years. The sushi at our local super market in podunk Alaska was better than this. I asked the waiter (who was super nice) how many pieces the one roll had before I ordered. He said 8 and assured me that they're a really good size. It came out with 5 TINY pieces for each roll. It tasted like it had been sitting out for hours and the rice was hard and stale. I asked him if it was a half order and showed him a pic of other volcano rolls on Yelp. He looked at my sushi and said \"uhhh yeah that doesn't look like a volcano roll at all\" so he talked to the sushi chef. I guess the chef told him it was in fact the volcano roll which I found so odd. It was inedible and I had to ask it be taken off my bill. I was REALLY looking forward to sushi and it was just downright bad. I DID however love the honey toast. So good. I'd go back just for that but the sushi was gross. I regret not taking a picture for the review but I was just so turned off. Oh and if you don't want loud house music while eating your dinner, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"1. The flamboyant and fun host is EVERYTHING. He and several of the waiters/waitresses also gave an impromptu dance performance and invited people up to the stage with them, while showering the diners with (fake) hundred dollar bills. Amazing.  2. The food is GOOD. Brussels sprouts are amazing (I judge a restaurant by the quality of their brussels sprouts) - super tangy and sweet and salty at the same time. The Tiger Roll that I got was also tasty and filled me up. Edamame was nice (it's kind of hard to mess edamame up).   Come here for a great time with friends (not family, since it's not exactly kid friendly)!"}
{"text":"This place ROKS! I came here for a girlfriend's birthday with a group of 7 people at 6pm on a Sunday. We did make a reservation ahead of time, but I think we would have been fine either way. I love the look of the space, it's a modern and lively atmosphere. The staff is all very fun and they do little performances and dances randomly throughout your meal, which is super entertaining. They actually brought the birthday girl on stage to dance with them! They also have a girl that comes to your table to do Sake Bombs with you. It's really a fun experience! As for the food, we had a family style dinner and here is what we had: edamame with some kind of delicious chili sauce all over it, rock shrimp which was SO amazing, a mixed fish tartare type of appetizer with chips for dipping, 2 really great sushi rolls, a sliced chicken dish drizzled with some kind of teriyaki type sauce and bok choy on the side, and assorted mochi, in which one of the flavors was cookies and cream and it was amazing! Honestly every food item was delicious and full of flavor. Between the great food and the awesomely fun atmosphere, I absolutely loved this experience and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool for Vegas and being a new spot on the strip. However, the sushi is extremely overpriced and the food in my opinion sucks. My boyfriend and I are huge foodies and tried this place out when it first opened. To be honest, I felt like the rolls were very dry and bland, not much flavor. Plus the price is just as expensive as Nobu or Koi and the amount of pieces and less and it's not even good. We weren't impressed by the specialty cocktails either. Overall, I was pretty disappointed. There are many places elsewhere in town that are worth the high dollar you pay."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! MC was hilarious and the impromptu dancing was great! Sushi was delish. Waiters slow to check on tables and beer was not as cold as it could have been but all in all great place for dinner."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends went down to try Sake Rok after an event at T-Mobile and boy did it not disappoint.  Not only were they able to get us in quickly, the food and atmosphere were amazing!  It is unfortunate that Las Vegas has gotten away from its hospitable nature, luckily Sake Rok delivered exceptional service throughout our entire dining process.... extremely refreshing!  Also I love to see when managerment is partaking in the most smallest of tasks to help alleviate stress from its servers. On numerous occasions, I witnessed the Assistant General Manager bussing tables, checking in with guest and was always visible on the floor! If you are looking for a great date spot, or somewhere to have fun after an event, Sake Rok will not disappoint.  I will definitley be back in the future."}
{"text":"This place rocks! We went for a late dinner after a concert at the T-Mobile arena. We were staying at Park MGM which currently has no room service past 6 PM, and we were pointed in the direction of the park, which contains several restaurants, and just three minutes of walking away from the hotel. We initially were going to choose a different restaurant but really liked the look of this restaurant from the outside and decided to go in. We are so happy we did! It is hip and fun, with a really cool ambience, great music, and excellent service. We ordered a Ramen soup, shishito peppers, and vegetable tempura for appetizers. For main entrées, my friend ordered the salmon which was incredible and I ordered a yellowtail with scallion roll and a Toro with scallion roll. We ordered a small bottle of bunny sake white peach flavor which was phenomenal. All of the food was delicious. It was perfection. The prices are more than reasonable and everything about this place is awesome. We are so coming back as locals and we know great restaurants in this town, so Sake Rok is definitely part of the great restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The yellow tail is one of my favorites. Chicken is a new kind of awesome. It's really hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Nice menu selection. But the main attraction is the staff that entertains constantly! Dancing, karaoke, jokes, actual singing. They have costumes and props too! We had awesome time at the Las Vegas location. One note - this place is not $$, but $$$."}
{"text":"Our flight landed at 730pm, and by the time we checked into our hotel, got situated, and went to dinner, it was 9:30pm... so we were starving!  We happen to find this place conveniently located right across the street from our hotel, The Monte Carlo. We walked in, and the first thing I noticed was the cool artwork/murals on the brick walls. We sat down & ordered our food, which came out pretty quickly. The sushi dishes were pretty small portions, but it was still delicious. As we were eating, all of the sudden, the music turned up, and next thing we knew all the staff were running around dancing, getting up on the bar dancing to disco music!! It was awesome:) Such entertainment! I'd recommend this place, although it was a little pricey for the portions you get, it's still worth experiencing."}
{"text":"went here for a friends birthday and it was definitely an experience! the decor was very artsy with a little oriental & a twist of modern graffiti. they have live music/dj and the servers are also the entertainers. they sing and dance around the restaurant & the prices are a little pricey so we paid a little extra for the experience.  the menu was some what overwhelming in size and volume! we got a dozen oysters - they were AMAZING! the best oysters i've had, ever.. the crispy rice - i thought it was going to be like a bowl of rice but it was surprisingly filling and delicious! similar to a sushi roll but instead a small rice patty served with tuna and some spice on top!  we also got a couple other sushi rolls that were very good as well!   definitely would be back whenever i am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Come here! Come here!!! Walked in for lunch based on reviews, sat at bar. Antwon (bartender), thank you for a fabulous experience! Had the sea bass and shishito peppers. Both outstanding!! Antwon said at night there is a lot of entertainment. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We got here right before closing and they sat us down no problem. This is not your typical sushi restaurant. There is a MC who goes around with a microphone and really gets everyone hyped up.  I honestly enjoyed the atmosphere a ton even though the music and the A/C cut out for a little.  I got the tempura rolls. I usually get this whenever I eat sushi and then just try other people rolls.  COME HERE FOR A FUN TIME AND SUSHI"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal . Hostesses were awesome accommodating my son who had pizza w him and very friendly . Sushi was fresh and creative without being crazy . Waitress (Hazel) super friendly and food came out fast . Must be awesome during a hockey game with atmosphere. Love that whole new area . Well done MGM . Plus a Celtics win"}
{"text":"The worst sushi place I ever eaten! I'm Japanese and I know how the sushi should taste like. I don't think there was any worker who speak Japanese. Over priced and sushi were all Americanized sushi. Nothing authentic.  Weird rolls were extremely expensive and everything was spicy. Sushi should not taste spicy. I thought it's a Japanese restaurant so I expected to be more quiet side but this place is very loud with shows and music.  Would t recommend to anyone who wants to eat authentic sushi  Read his sarcastic response! This is the type of service you will get! This place  is plain terrible both food and service. I'm so glad I don't have to go back to this trash. The worst Japanese restaurant ever in my life. Shame on you calling this place a Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing.  Good ambiance, good drinks, excellent food.  Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Did the 25$ all you can eat lunch. So much variety and great service. It's located right around the corner from New York New York. The fish was fresh, and the sushi waa amazing. Their shishito peppers are a must try at this place. Ramen came in a regular sized bowl. Definitely worth a try. If you're with a large group who can't make up their minds, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because let's face it half of the time we travel we don't know what's good. The number of ratings and of course helps in decision making. We waited quite some time for our appetizers. 25 minutes later our waitress tells us that there  was an issue and she forgot to put our order in . Hey at-least she was honest. Everything in that menu was great . I specially recommend the AYCE $35 bucks it's worth it. Reasonable for being Las Vegas. I absolutely recommend the Rok Ramen . It has great fusion of flavors. I've had one in San Diego and it grossed me out. I will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"Food was unreal!  Try the crispy rice cakes and the tiger roll!  Entertainment angle was super fun, everyone had a blast with the MC and the energy was great!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place after seeing the menu online. The restaurant decor and set up was nice and spacious. The host and waitress provided good service. You can definitely tell the place was nice. It struggled with its concept with its dinner and a show. They did dancing and some singing which I thought was unnecessary. We were celebrating a bachelor party for our friend and they brought him on stage for a lap dance which made everyone in the restaurant uncomfortable. There were servers that lingered around a lot. The food was really underwhelming compared to the prices. They recommended a seafood platter that was expensive on which the oysters tasted pretty standard,  crab legs that were bland and prawns were overcooked. Was not a fan of our appetitizers either; rok shrimp, some mushroom dish was nothing special. Only good thing was the wagyu tomahawk steak. Another thing that upset us was the $14 kirin large, it was more like a small for the price we paid. This place still needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"This place is not for family! It is totally a party place with super loud music. The waiter are rude. There were plenty of empty tables but we had to wait because they said they did not have enough servers!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fantastic sushi restaurant with a fun, entertaining environment, this is the place to go! My sister and I went here for dinner before we went to a concert at the T-mobile arena. The sushi was fresh and delicious, a little pricey thought, bit still good! The rolls we got were around $18.00 a roll. Then there was dining and entertainment. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.   The reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hostesses definitely need to get their s**t together. We had a reservation, but still had wait 15 minutes to be seated even though the place was practically empty as we were wait my."}
{"text":"An amazing good time!!!  Food was delicious and the staff entertainment was fun.  Only go here if you want to be loud, laugh, dance and have a memorable time.  Oh, and get sake bombs for your group."}
{"text":"My wife, friends and I went to Sake Rok last night based on a recommendation of a local denizen. To summarize, we were underwhelmed and would not return.  It's an interesting concept- dance club and sushi. There's a DJ who plays mostly 80's music (which I like), but the ambience was extremely loud and noisy. Perfect to go with someone you don't want to talk to.  The service- we had two servers. One was new and training. I had to ask for sake at least 5 times throughout the meal. They just kept forgetting each time I asked. When I made the reservation, the woman asked if there was any special occasion. I told her that we had just gotten married and were on our honeymoon.  When we arrived, she congratulated us, asked for and wrote down my wife's name. Throughout the evening the DJ (dressed as Sho-nuf from The Last Dragon, if you're old enough to remember that one) was giving shout-outs to all the young ladies celebrating weddings and birthdays. He never acknowledged my wife. I don't know, maybe it was because we are in our fifties.  The price- $200 for four people. I can't complain about that especially for Vegas.  Summary- I think this place would be best for the younger crowd that enjoys loud music.  Actually, a table of twenty-somethings left after perusing the menu and without ordering. The food is par, nothing special. The DJ was friendly, affable and congenial. But we would have enjoyed the meal more without that concept."}
{"text":"I tried sushi rok for the first time and I'm pretty impressed. It's different from any other sushi restaurant because the staff interacts with the audience. If you're looking for a show to go with your sushi, this is the place for you. They also have plenty of sushi options to choose from and all the rolls we got were delicious"}
{"text":"If a college party bar had a head-on collision with a sushi restaurant and then immediately got puked all over by a C-list pop girl group, there's a good chance a Sake Rok would sprout out of the ground within seconds.      First of all, what the fuck is up with the menus?  They only supply one menu to the table and it is about 3' by 1.5' in size.  Ridiculous and inconvenient!  I had to lean this silly billboard on the side of my chair while trying to make sure it didn't fall to the ground the whole time.  Ever wonder why almost every other restaurant in the world gives individual menus to every patron?  Because, holy shit, (gasp) it works!!  Menu PDF on the phone, please.     Food clearly takes a backseat to alcohol and drink prices are respectable for the Strip.  $12 cocktails, $45 fish bowls (good for 4-6 people) and more than enough sake bomb chants to have you still hearing them the next morning ensure everyone can get as drunk as they want.  I wanted to get smashed as soon as I was seated.      This spot would be best suited for bachelorette parties.  The most entertaining performance by the staff was an NSync vs Backstreet Boys dance mash up that had me cracking up as soon as the puppet strings dropped down from the second floor.  Just because this isn't my scene doesn't mean I can't appreciate what they're at least shooting for :)    I'd probably go with one of the food packages at the bottom of the menu if I were to return since they're better value, but if a decent Japanese-ish dinner is what you're after, consider at least five other spots on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Last day of Vegas with our group and we decided to eat some sushi! They were ONLY 3 tables that were occupied in the restaurant out of like 20+ and the service was super super slow!! The waitress (which came around maybe twice) forgot to take our order for like 20 minutes and the Food wasn't even that great. I do not recommend anyone to eat this overpriced basic sushi!"}
{"text":"Sake Rok is new and exciting, something I've never seen in Las Vegas. The staff keep the energy up and the guests entertained during your whole dining experience. Everyone was friendly and helpful. A great place for a birthday party, bachelorette or bachelor party dinner, or even unique date night. I went for a girl's night out and it was a fabulous time!   We started out with their drink menu. The cocktails are to die for! My favorites would be the Hunny Bunny (tastes like Cinnamon Toast Crunch) & the Dragonfly (I think it tastes like Mexican candy, sweet with the perfect amount of spicy). You have to try them! My friend and I tried about 6 (total, I'm not a complete lush) of the drinks and we would order all of again. Bartender Virginia was very attentive and personable. Great at making drinks and knowledgable about the menu. Angel was also a great help when Virginia took a quick break.   Now for the food..WOW! You know it's going to be good when they have double sided chop sticks!Everything's we ordered (about 11 different items, we were hungry and wanted to try as much as possible) was delicious.  My favorite item was the hamachi Serrano, raw yellowtail with some type of magical sauce topped with a Serrano pepper. Seriously so good, my friend and I rock, paper, scissored it for the last piece. I would come back for just this dish. Definitely need to get this if you enjoy fish. The edamame was garlicky and so so good. Dumplings were great. I'm not sure what rolls we ordered but we ate it all! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Sushi is some of the best in Las Vegas and the atmosphere is unparalleled. Try the tuna belly nigiri and the spicy tuna crispy rice!"}
{"text":"Both the food and entertainment are over the top here.  Great for all ages.  It's pricey but the food quality and flavor are top notch.  Highly recommend Sake Rok!"}
{"text":"The edamame Rok was awesome. Spicy and tangy. El Chapo roll was ok (a little bland) not a fan of cilantro on my sushi roll so I picked it off. Kamikaze roll was delicious. the Sake Rom Private sake was perfect with a Kirin Ichiban draft beer. The atmosphere is fun and lively. They have a DJ spinning and a MC going around taking sake bombs with people. The MC gets the crowd involved making it a social dining experience. Lots of fun. a sushi bar you must experience!"}
{"text":"Being from San Diego, I know good seafood and this place was definitely not worth it for the price we paid! Nice decor but won't be back.."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the sushi at all. It wasn't bad and it wasn't great. The location is super cool, the staff is great and the drinks were great though! It's kind of strange that you only get one menu and it's so big. Basically you have to take turns figuring out what you want."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW, amazing food and great staff. We tried a few different things and all was extremely good. Lexi our server was a rock star, very helpful and was always smiling. The hanger steak was melt in my mouth good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Very creative and rich in flavor. Beyond that, service was phenomenal. Great place, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"DJ Thomas (aka DJ) was an engaging and entertaining server. Food was remarkable. Live entertainment is fun. A must for all."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun! The drinks were amazing, the staff was excellent, the entertainment was fun, and the sushi was amazing!  It was a little more expensive than we had anticipated, but we had a great time at Sake Rok!  We will definitely be going back next trip to Vegas !"}
{"text":"Went during a SLOW time, they just opened for lunch. A+ on asking for and writing down my food allergies for the server & kitchen (which are MANY) and ambiance.   However, we told the hostess stand and our server I wanted basic Ahi Tuna and our first visit and no one helped us. The waitress did not know the menu items at all and did not ask anyone else to help her. I think our experience would have been much better if the waitress knew the menu, offered suggestions, asked someone to help us out."}
{"text":"The most stylish sushi experience you can get.  Sake Rok is a part time sushi restaurant, part time dance club that is oozing with flair.  Combining old style favorite Japanese dishes with inventive spices and seasonings give Sake Rok's distinct taste while their decoration and atmosphere make it unique even among the other themed restaurants in the Las Vegas strip.  Like most places on the strip, Sake Rok is a bit expensive, but if you want the most bang for your buck, I recommend the edamame appetizer, loaded with garlic, salt, and other spices and sharing a Sake Rok Ramen with someone.  The ramen is huuuuge and well worth the price.  Splitting an additional sushi roll makes for a complete meal with one of their many brands of sake as a great bonus.  For huge parties, try their Godzilla plate, with enough sushi for 6-8 (or less depending on how much of a sushi glutton you are).  Each plate is served on a custom made Godzilla tray, complete with a Godzilla figure that breaths smoke while you eat.  Sadly, you cannot take the tray home with you.  Sake Rok is open as early as lunch, but it's best to go during the evening.  At night, they blast dance music and switch on a projector showing social media and pop themed imagery and at night, all servers will break into synchronized dance at the random points through the meal.  Not only can your server dance, but they are all super friendly, able to make great recommendations and delve into the menu in full detail.  Get your clubbing and dinning experience wrapped up in one shot with Sake Rok's awesome blend of scenery and cuisine."}
{"text":"This was definitely NOT the experience I was expecting....and I don't mean that in a bad way. Like with any new restaurant, they have some grand opening kinks to work out, and that's too be expected.  I wandered in here on my lunch break and the LOUD music blasting towards outside should've been my first clue as to how this was going to be.....but we went in anyways.  The downstairs dining room is fairly intimate. The tables are very close together....but don't worry about anyone else being able to hear your conversation - nobody can hear ANYTHING because the music is so freaking loud. I know I sound super old right now, but this is just not my scene. This is the perfect place to go with a group if you are celebrating something fun or heading out for the night.   The wait staff all seem like they just drank a case of Red Bull each.....they were all over the place. Turns out they are all actually dancers/entertainers and don't have a lot of food service experience. They were all very nice though, if not a little scattered. They actually all do choreographed routines and dance around the restaurant. It's cool, but who's serving my food while this is happening? Kinda weird.  If you'd like to know about the vibe - there is a DJ with a dance floor, as well as a roof top deck. The menus are HUGE - something you'll have to see to believe.   Now, the food - it was actually really good. I just had the wagyu sliders (which have foie gras on them - YES!) and the hamachi serrano, which is always a favorite of mine. Both were VERY good.  Overall, I think this place is a great addition to the Park and will do very well since they are right by the new arena."}
{"text":"I went to Sake Rock last night with my husband and it was fantastic! There wasn't a wait when we went and our server, Amanda, was great. She knew the menu really well and took wonderful care of us! We had a seaweed salad, Girl on the Beach Roll and Eel Avocado Roll. Oh my, the eel avocado was to die for!! The girl on the beach was very good, though I would probably try another one next time. The seaweed salad was good too. It can be a little bit loud inside, but if you're looking for entertainment you found the right place! The staff had a whole choreographed routine to Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC songs so that was kind of fun. If you're looking for a quiet place to go out, this is not the place for you, but if you're looking for dinner and a show this is the place for you! Thank you for a delicious dinner Sake Rok, Amanda and the rest of the staff (:"}
{"text":"Food: -Salt & Pepper Shrimp - I enjoyed the aioli it came with and the shichimi -ROK ceviche - meh. They should try serving it with little rice cracker chips -Tiger Roll, El Chapo Roll, ROK & Roll - everything pretty much had fake crab in it, so meh.   Ambiance: This place is not for food, it's for sake bombs and entertainment. I enjoyed the free little show. The MC was energetic and flamboyant and they did a boy band set with a mix of NSYNC and Back Street Boys, so that was right up my alley! Super entertaining and fun. This place is perfect for a bachelorette party. It is SUPER LOUD in here and conversation is IMPOSSIBLE. This place is not a place for kids. The MC drops F-bombs, and it's basically a club atmosphere.  Service: Our service was ok. Water re-fills were attentive and our food came out quickly. I tried to order a virgin mojito and they came back and said they didn't have any mint leaves. :-(  Tip: Ask for a seat downstairs and in the middle so you can see everything during shows.  Note: Bathroom is unisex so everyone goes in the same door and washes hands at the same sinks (bathroom stalls are individual and the door/wall goes from floor to ceiling). There is a bathroom attendant (again club feel).  Won't be back."}
{"text":"My cousin had her post wedding dinner at Sake Rok and it was just fabulous! There was an emcee and all the servers provided entertainment as well. The emcee was awesome and so engaging and funny too! Sake bombs are a must and very entertaining as well as everyone gets involved. They have a signature drink which is smoked and the presentation was outstanding.   They have a variety of fried foods. I enjoyed their chicken karaage and shrimp on a skewer. Our sushi was the Godzilla platter which was ok. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"I read another review that said that Sake Rok was better than Sushi Samba and Blue Ribbon so, I decided to give it a try. I am SO glad I did! I completely agree with that review. The food was amazing, the entertainment was diverse and fun and overall great and the servers are all very fun, happy, attentive and helpful. I was only sad I didn't have more space in my stomach to keep ordering! By the way we ordered a second volcano roll after we finished the first one, that good! And get the spicy edamame! Can't remember the exact name."}
{"text":"Situé à proximité de l'hôtel NewYork NewYork NewYork, ce restaurant japonais offre un cadre idéal et une carte complète et abordable. Après un accueil peu chaleureux par une hôtesse pas souriante qui nous (6 personnes) a faits poireauter 10 minutes pour soit-disant préparer une table dans une salle vide où toutes les tables étaient prêtes, nous avons été servis cette fois-ci agréablement et rapidement. Plats de bonne qualité. Prix raisonnables pour le lieu."}
{"text":"The food here was good. Everything is on the pricier side and the rolls seemed smaller than other places I've been to. I do have to say that the dessert - honey toast - was BOMB! I also tried the Omakase with the bf. It was pretty good, but that's only because I've been to some really great Omakase restaurants (one where all the fish is flown from Japan and was prepared in front of you - OMAKASE in SF).   The ambience seemed fun. Expect dinner and a show, which means that it's kind of loud. They also pull people from the crowd, which was fun. The waiters and waitresses are the performers. However, this makes getting help hard when the show is happening."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night for my birthday dinner and had one of the best dining experiences. The entertainment was surprising but so fun! My friends and I got to take sake bombs with the head entertainer (Jeffrey?) and got to dance on a small stage with the whole cast. I was nervous that I was going to be called out individually because of my birthday but I was so glad they included all of us. Our server was DJ, he was so sweet and helpful. I was unsure on what I wanted to eat and he gave me advice and it was perfect! I got the tempura roll. It was not the best sushi I've ever had but it was what I wanted! Also got the crispy Brussels sprouts, seriously the best ones I've ever had! Definitely recommend! Over all a perfect birthday dinner, good food, great drinks, and amazing service and entertainment!"}
{"text":"Great place for a Girls night out!! Love the ambiance and the energy this place brings but the food is amazing too!! Go in and see Chef Kato.. He will definitely make you a sushi platter you won't forget and will keep wanting you to come back! I highly recommend the el chapo roll and the rok shrimp which are my personal favorite but oh my lanta I was able to try the HONEY TOAST and I felt like I was I heaven! Definitely the best honey toast in Vegas I must say!! Better than Ichiza! The honey toast had fresh fruit and was drenched with honey butter and ice cream with a hint of cinnamon on it! I can't wait to go back just to order the honey toast! a must try!!"}
{"text":"This place is lit up. Even on a rainy Thursday at 9 pm! It's loud but the music is fun and gets you in the spirit.  Our waiter was great with explaining and giving us time. Had the Dragonfly cocktail. The miso soup was was amazing but not enough in the cup! Also two rolls. Volcano and Western both good. We also got shrimp, the biggest ones you've seen. Which is why they cost $7 each. Pricey but worth it and the scene is very electric."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on Mother's Day to check out The Park and the new arena. Without going into a million details let me just say that they desperately need employee training and some sort of management. Although very nice nobody knew what they were doing !! Sad really to open such a high profile place with zero professional staff. We tried two rolls and by any standard they were half the size of a regular roll and perhaps could have been referred to as mini rolls !! I would not got back but am sure that they will do well because they have a captive audience being right next to the arena."}
{"text":"Very good food - but very trendy and loud. Warning they really push Saki bombs - which I enjoy other people doing on my behalf! Ha!  I had a volcano roll and the pork belly - both awesome!   Prices are reasonable and service was attentive and accurate.  I'll stop in again next time through."}
{"text":"We came here with a hungry stomach and friend's recommendation, had no idea what we would experience. And O-M-G, we were at a show where also serves sushi?!   The ambiance was amazing, I didn't know the servers were part of the show/dance and they were doing a fantastic job! My favorite part was definitely the boyband battle (and I will keep the details as a secret). It was fun and very entertaining!   As for the food, it went on the pricey side in terms of the portion. Delicious, but pricey. If you are looking for a solo food experience, it's not the place to go. However, my friends and I all agreed it balanced out when it was actually food + show combo. We came here with no reservation on a Sunday night (around 8PM), got seated right away. The restaurant was really dark, took us some time to read the menu.   2017014"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful. I have celiac and loved the Girl on the Beach Roll - it was delicious and easy to make gluten free (and most of their menu items are too!). My friend (who hates sushi/fish/seafood) got the Chicken Katsu Roll and absolutely loved it. The highlight was definitely the Toban Yaki, which is an amazing mushroom dish! The staff was extremely knowledgeable about allergies and food sensitivities and ways to accommodate several food restrictions. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have never experienced dining like this before. I didn't look at reviews beforehand, just came here on a friends suggestion. If you're looking for a nice intimate spot to share sushi with a date or friends, this is not the place for you. It's a loud, half bar, half club, half restaurant, half instructional video establishment.  One of the weirder elements involved in dining here is a dude, who I want to refer to as the hype man. He was all done up with make-up and funky attire. He stopped by our table twice to make small talk with us. We just weren't into it. He was nice enough, but I could have done without him.   I've also never been to a restaurant with instructional videos. I've been to lots of bars with TV's playing games (which this one was when it wasn't showing said videos). The table next to us ordered saki bombs. Then the hype man came over to hype up the fact that they were ordering the bombs and told us to turn our attention to the screen. It legit was a silly sketch on how to do a saki bombs. Thanks?  The sushi was good, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed almost everything we ordered, except for the eel roll with foam on top. It was one of the specialty ones, and I just didn't care for the taste or texture. We ordered yellowtail jalapeño, spicy salmon and a handful of other rolls. The yellowtail was my fave, no surprise there as it's always my fave. I was surprised at the contrast between the SUPER attentive hype man and our lackadaisical server. We had to wave her down for the check, because we never saw her after our sushi was delivered. We would have ordered another round if she would have stopped by.   I think I get what they're trying to do. Out of the box dining experience with club atmosphere flair. I just don't know how into it I was. Maybe it would have been better to stop by for drinks? I'm just not sure I'm sold on the schtick."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm jaded by really good sushi in a nice environment done by really good sushi chefs, but this place was at best ok. The music was loud and annoying sorta rap and the people walking around picking up plates were more attentive than the waiter. The sushi was more expensive and in smaller quantity, with the specialty sushi not being memorable. Same for their saki choices.  I guess for being a sports bar sushi joint it must have been ok, but that's not what I went for. Sorry"}
{"text":"During a soft opening the crew was dishing out 2 signature cocktails, beer and sake bombs. I went for the citrus based and it was fantastic! The energy, the potential the view from the upstairs - the staff was dancing and completely engaged. Looking forward to experiencing their culture and sushi! Let's keep It a 5 star!"}
{"text":"We are big review people here - I want to know what I am getting into before I go somewhere. We are in Vegas for a conference and wanted to get sushi. This place was awesome!!! The atmosphere is one of a kind. They do a little choreographed dance every 30 minutes or so and the dance is a few minutes long. All of the servers dance too! So cool. We loved the edamame rok. We also had shrimp tempura rolls and salmon tempura roll. Us four women shared a \"bowl.\" $50 bucks for a gigantic mixed drink - all of us had plenty. Additionally, if you get the chance, do a Sake bomb with the crew. So fun. Highly recommend for both food and entertainment."}
{"text":"Super nice place, the food was good but the service was great... Very nice and attentive. The pork belly is a must, didn't think it would be so good but it was so good."}
{"text":"Was hanging out at Toshiba Park for the VGK game. My friend and I were hungry so we rolled in here for some sushi and to watch the 3rd period. Nice atmosphere, nice decorations, and pretty good service. They had the game projected on a wall so it was perfect for our needs.  Maybe its my old eyes, but my friend said the same thing, the menu is hard to read under that lighting. That's pretty much my only complaint, everything else was pretty good. Prices a bit high but that's the strip. I ordered the 49th state roll and the salmon/avocado hand roll, my friend went with Baked crab hand rolls and Yellowtail jalapeno. A large order of edamame as well. Good stuff.  They have singing and some dancing in here as well, and a lot of sake bombs were going off. At one point the game was on and the entertainer was trying to sing Happy birthday to someone and no one was paying any attention...so it got redone during a commercial break. LOL.  Fun place. Food is decent, priced high, but a great atmosphere. And lots of cute waitresses!!! 4 stars for the atmosphere, 3.5 for the sushi."}
{"text":"Definitely a go to when your in Vegas! The food and atmosphere is amazing. I didn't expect both to be so good. The food comes out so quickly. They perform different shows regularly. The hostesses could be less rude(they gave me a time limit when eating), but great experience overall!!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch!  The place looks awesome.  The food was spectacular!  Loved, Loved,  Loved the Lobster Benedict! Not to mention how much I loved the Poke Stack, Omurice, Skirt Steak and Eggs, Roasted Chicken, and ROK French Toast. Oh and you can't leave without a Sake Bomb and you can't do brunch without a bottomless Mimosa! Now that I think of it....I loved it ALL.  I need to come here at night because I can imagine this place ROKS (See what I did).  The service was great, the entertainment was fun for a Sunday.  The MC, think his name was Simon, was fun and engaging."}
{"text":"False advertisement!!! In new year, the stated it is the best place to see the fireworks and the ball drop. Nothing close to this. I complained w/ the manager and he said u can watch it in the TV, hahaha. We were just able to see the Monte Carlo building. We got a table and pay extra ticket to see OT Genesis that night. He did not sing or play any song.. this place sucks and had false propaganda. I drove to Las Vegas to have fun in New Year's Eve and we waisted our money in this place. Don't trust on this place at all."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of co-workers to grab dinner before heading out in Vegas.  The sushi was good - nothing spectacular - and extremely expensive for the quantity that you get.  Good thing our workplace was paying.  If I came back on my own dime, I would likely choose a different restaurant.  That said, the dancing waiters and waitresses were a hit.  I'm still not sure what's up with the dude with the kimono... but you know... it's Vegas.  :)"}
{"text":"Worst Sushi I have ever had. Fish seems old with a smell and taste like it's been sitting for 3 or more days in frig. There is an after taste when eating. The roll looks well rolled but some  looked pre rolled not just done for you. Sorry inexperience diners may not notice with all the sauces but I am from the islands and know good fresh sushi. Oh..Sauce on fish is good. If that makes up for the aged fish."}
{"text":"What a fun atmosphere!! Very upbeat, a little pricey but not terrible considering you are in Vegas and you get a show too!! Great sushi, great cocktails, definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Went here based on ratings and it is a good experience. The thing that makes it great is the staff but the sushi is good too. I got the rok tempura shrimp, volcano roll, one beer and a carafe of house sake. Total of 67$. Not terrible bit not great. The sushi was decent but not wow. The wasabi had no punch to it. The rating would honestly be lower for that cost if not for their hospitality and dance every 30 min. Shout out to Amanda for great service."}
{"text":"This place is a blast! The atmosphere is a little overwhelming at first, but soon you're dancing on the tables - literally. Prepare yourself for delicious food, strong drinks, and a damn good time. I would suggest hitting up Sake Rok when you're looking for a fun night out with friends rather than a romantic night out due to the shear noise level and lively entertainment. I went with folks from work and while we were all originally apprehensive, we had a few Sake Bombs and joined in on the fun."}
{"text":"Ok... 2.5 stars maybe. First a little background. I'm from New York and an familiar with the best and rarest sushi restaurants in Manhattan and Long Island. I can eat it all as long as it's still not moving. .   When I go out to eat sushi the quality of the food and the ambience are important to me. Sake Rok is a sports bar sushi restaurant so as long as you don't mind the voices of a loud referee and screams over your shoulder every time a play is made to sushi then ok... this is the place for you. It's relatively inexpensive but then again... All depends on what you want. Not for me personally. I like a quieter atmosphere with a cozier ambience. At one point I was looking for the ball park hot dogs."}
{"text":"Probably the best place on earth!!!! I am absolutely in love with this place. The atmosphere and the service was impeccable. I really wish they had one here in Denver. Their Godzilla drink was amazing! I can't wait to go back and tell all my friends about it. The entertainment is on a whole never level. I can't rave enough!"}
{"text":"I read about this place on eater las vegas fb..its located in new park area behind ny ny hotel..interior was really cool n modern..i had a great n friendly server..d.j...he explained menu items n when i asked what signature cocktail do u recommend ..he said to try the dragonfly..it was yummy..sweet refreshing n a bit spicy..all good..for appetizer i tried the wagyu beef tataki..it was a bit chewy n had a smoky flavor which i didnt expect..it was not great but just ok...i tried the omakase 12 piece chef selection sashimi plate..beautiful presentation n delicious!..i also ordered a few pieces of nigiri sushi n was also satisfied with that!..awesome food n service! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I could start by raving about the small dishes I started my meal with such as the Toban Yaki with a side of coconut rice.. Or the baked crab hand rolls made with baked snow crab and this spicy aioli sauce that is to die for.  These two dishes sparked my tastebuds and I wasn't sure how they would top them.  Rok shrimp tempura was perfect and had a nice mild spice to it. Sushi rolls like the El Chapo, Chi Chi Roll (porkbelly sushi roll), High Steaks roll (formally known as the fancy wagyu roll), and 49th State roll would be my top choice and watching the Godzilla platter come out to another table makes me want to go back right now just to have all to myself. We also had some of the steak and chicken dishes, however my end all and the main reason this will be one of my weekly spots is the HONEY TOAST!!!! This was by far the best I've ever had!! Being a fatkid eating honey toast from different countries and many states I can truly say this above any other will blow your mind.  #fatkidforlife"}
{"text":"To be honest, I just can't get past these crazy prices. Ok, the location is ok, but that still doesn't  justify these crazy prices for just OK food. I tried the sliders, chicken, and sushi and nothing made me want more. Honestly I only ate the food because I paid for it. How about this I would never go there again even if I had a 50% off coupon.   Tip - After you walk in a see the over the top prices on the largest menu in the world, it is ok to just walk out and go somewhere else. Or and another tip, just ignore the crazy guy massaging the other guy at the bar. I guess one of the employees was sore and another guy was rubbing ice on him. This isn't a joke. I should have taken a picture of this."}
{"text":"Sake Rok defies stuffy stereotypes about sushi places, and forgoes typical dinning etiquette to be a  hybrid of a restaurant, a comedy club, and a dance club.  With Pittbull's music blaring and club lights spinning from the DJ booth in the corner, we walked in at dining room at Sushi Rok (pronounced 'Rock\", like Rock and Roll, natch). We were seated quickly and a staff member came out to get our drink order. Our server soon followed to explain the menu, which includes traditional sushi roles, specialty rolls, and even steak- Because they are more than just sushi, our server explained.  More than sushi they are: someone that can only be described as a hype-man worked the room during our meal, moving table to table with a microphone to interview people and make jokey small talk. At one point he interrupted the dining room with his microphone to introduce a wacky \"How to do sakki bombs\" video, projected 10 feet up on the wall behind us. Then collectively as a restaurant we cheered on another table as they did their first sakki bomb drink.  Schtick aside, the food was good. With big appetites, my table of 4 ordered a mix of several traditional roles, specialty rolls, edamame, and seaweed salads. The presentation was nice and the rolls were all delicious with more than enough to go around. Because I like a value, I found our bill to be surprisingly reasonable for the amount of food and drinks. Not to mention, we got a dose of all the on-site entertainment swirling around us.  If you are looking for a traditional sushi place, this place won't appeal to you, but as a fun alternative, especially if you have a large group, this is a good dining option with a lot of Vegas flair."}
{"text":"High energy and entertaining. Be prepared for the audience participation. Loud and over priced but I guess you are paying for the entertainment. I would go their again for drinks and appetizers or the honey toast but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I have nothing but affinity for this hugely wonderful Vegas dining experience. This is not a place that you would want to go to have a quiet dinner, because it is so interactive and so wonderfully fun. The food is incredible- top grade sushi with amazing flavor. You MUST try the coconut rice. It's a game changer. The sushi was delectable as were the spicy edamame and brussel sprouts. We were not crazy about their version of the seaweed salad but it was fine. The desert- described as a fortress of goodness- was full of honey and sweet bread and fresh fruit. Don't miss that! Say hello to Maria in the washroom, she is a gem. The dining experience was so personal and purposeful. The owners were genuinely kind and I think we met every employee, which was a treat. I don't want to give too much away but definitely go and enjoy your time at this gem of a place on the Vegas strip. You won't regret it. Possibly my new favorite place in the country but definitely in Vegas!! A+++"}
{"text":"Very slow.   Non-Asian tables got their food faster than I did - for the same kind of food (nigiri).  --- 30 mins later our food arrived.   I got the nigiri- the fish was warm, and not fresh. Rice was too sticky, and too heavy on sushi vinegar."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is tough on conversations but very easy on celebrations. Not a date-night place; however, larger groups of under-30s and bachelor(ette) party-goers will enjoy it a lot. Servers are attentive and very festive. Food is good but not great. Sushi was good quality and very reasonable in portion size. Veggie tempura portion was crazy tiny. Sake selection was solid."}
{"text":"A very hip place with a wild entertainment factor!  Defiantly worth it the food and great service!  VERY VERY FUN! Not thrilled that you have to pay to park BUT....  you will forget about that once you try to food.. the coconut rice is amazing!"}
{"text":"omg @sakeroklv is insane the decor is badass we look like were in japan, if they played japanese american music would be dope!!!   great experience for my first time   sushi is great"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place but was dissapointed. The sushi is not fresh and overpriced. Also selection is limited as far as variety of rolls. It seemed like they were trying to emulate tokyo delves in LA, but missed the mark."}
{"text":"We loved this place, it was really fun. It is a great place to celebrate. The food is great, the sake was great and the whole scene was great. As some other reviewers mentioned, this is not a quiet romantic place, its a fun restaurant with silly entertainment. My 14 yr old got pulled up onto the stage area to dance at one point-as shocked as they were, they had a blast."}
{"text":"A group of 11 of us girls went here for a bachelorette party meal out. It is definitely a party restaurant that can get quite loud but the histrionics fit our mood perfectly. They have fixed menus for larger groups and Keoki was super helpful with our menu requests. One of us was allergic to shrimp and another needed to avoid all sugar, she found a way to accommodate us. The girls were impressed with the lively \"dinner and a show\" and the food was pretty good, too. The food came out quickly, but at an appropriate pace to have our 6pm dinner reservation line up with our 9pm thunder from down under tickets. Thanks for impressing my bride to be and her friends, Sake Rok!"}
{"text":"Pretty poor services but the music, dancers, and food was good. Pretty $$$ for small portions. I would not recommend for families with kids or couples who are looking for a romantic night. Super hip but would rather have good services instead."}
{"text":"Awesome party dinner environment!!! Be ready to do Sake bombs. Great to start your evening off with some food and drinks. The entertainment was amazing and unique."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! Miso cod and blueberry Bunny sparkling sake? Say no more!   It's 9pm on a Wednesday night (we dine everywhere with our 9 month old baby-luckily he's behaved). We ask the hostess for a table and a high chair, she informs us no kids allowed after 7pm \"due to the provocative dancing and music\". Ok no problem! So we sit outside. After waiting 15 mins (keep in mind the hostess who sat us is literally right in front of us this entire time, maybe 10 feet away) my husband asks if we can get that high chair we asked for or a server. At this point I normally would have left but we were already situated with the baby and I really was in the mood for this miso cod.   We ordered their sake cocktail (which was the highlight of the dinner), edamame, some color me roll (simple but good), cucumber salad (funkier than the normal but ok), rock shrimp (good), a side of this coconut rice (awesome! They said it was made with coconut milk and coconut flakes).......  And then we asked for the \"steamed vegetables\" specifically told her no salt or sauce that it was for the baby. It came out covered in oil and sesame seeds.......  After the majority of our food comes out (930pm ish) a stroller with a baby comes out of the restaurant-I thought how strange considering we were told we weren't allowed to sit inside with a child. So unless that child had been in there since 7 (2 and a half hours earlier) kinda irritating.  Once all of our entire order made the table the server came back to let me know the kitchen was out of cod. Literally we were done with everything by this point. She said they could make it with salmon (she had seen it done, but never tried it). 10 mins later the salmon made it to the table. It was surprisingly really good, plated with peppers and a coconut foam.  The two stars is specifically for the sake cocktail and coconut rice, I will have to get my miso cod elsewhere because we won't be back."}
{"text":"We came to have dinner here before a knights game. I think it really tied the evening together. The parade was going on outside and a knight in costume came in to hype the people eating. Quickly I learned that the rest of the time spent here would be the same. There was a DJ & lots of entertainment. It was fun! Kinda loud at times. My favorite roll of the evening was the El Chapo roll."}
{"text":"I went to Vegas for CES andtried this place out. It was really good. We all got sake bomb and some entertainment. It was crowded at night. This place is a little pricey but it's kind of expected when you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place needs to be appreciated for what it is. It's a great entertainment venue. Wait staff performs quite often, and it's a fun place to go if you want to party. The food quality is decent. The hamachi Serrano, togaroshi salmon sashimi, and rock shrimp were some of our favorites. The hanger steak was chewy, almost jerky like. The toro was terrrible!! Do not get the toro! I have never seen toro with an oxidized tint of color like that, but still took a chance to try. It was super watery, almost like it had just been defrosted and needed a little more time. The spicy tuna hand roll was pretty good. Overall, I would give the food 3 stars. Stick to the basics, because this place should not be judged by food. The prices are steep, but you're mostly paying for experience and atmosphere to party. Service is what it is for the fact that they stop and dance for you almost every 30 minutes. Servers are not very knowledgeable about sushi, sake, or the menu. However, they are great performers. Our total bill was $260 for two people with a moderate amount of food. If you're looking for quality food, and a nice romantic dinner then this place is not for you. If you're looking for a place to pre party with small bites and great entertainment, you've found your spot !"}
{"text":"Sushi was strangely prepared, meaning the ingredient combinations didn't fit well. Why cover your sushi rolls in panko so all I taste is the aftertaste of panko stuck in my back molars, instead of the taste of the fish?  Also, my soft shell crab roll was fried in a batter normally used for chicken. The food is edible but just \"off\"-- not an authentic sushi place."}
