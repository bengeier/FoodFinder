{"text":"It was nice to be able to have a sit down dinner before the hockey game.  Food was good (Pimento cheese burger and fries were definitely a standout).  Service was slow.  Atmosphere was interesting - the space and tables were nice, the folding chairs and plastic silverware seemed out of place.

Overall - we'd go back.  It took the stress and hassle out of making a stop for dinner before a game."}
{"text":"Brunch buffet food tasted good and was hot, ($16 per person)!  However, the only service that is provided by the wait staff is refilling of soft drinks or water, I'm not sure that that warrants an additional 20% automatically added on to your bill for gratuity.  The Red Line club is cool because the hockey players walk through on their way to the ice, but it's not any more uniquely appointed than any other cafeteria-style restaurant.  There were only two of us in our party, again, I was surprised by the mandatory charge."}
{"text":"Would go 2-1/2 stars if I could. Let's go, 1st - why does this place open just an hour before game time when it takes 45 minutes to get your food? 2nd - takes a while for the servers to make first contact, then 15 minutes to get a beer (what no Heineken... you gotta be kidding), 3rd - ordered a chicken quesadilla & it came with no chicken, but a hamburger patty, the kind you get in the public school cafeteria. I would have sent it back had I not just waited 45 minutes & the checkers were already on the ice. 4th - price was a little high, two people $55 before tip, probably should have gone somewhere else if I wanted to get my money's worth. Wrap up - for convenience sake, I so wanted them NOT to fail, I'll have a hard time bringing my customers to the Red Line Club for pre-gaming. The whole thing is kind of 2nd rate."}
{"text":"After our first visit, Our server was great.  I'll reserve my critical review for another time because this past experience was not great due to a supposed part being held sometime before the Checkers came back to town for this home stand. They didn't  clean up properly apparently which left a mess in the bar.  My wife ended up having ants in her Hurricane and that left a bad taste in both of our mouths. We plan on trying the Red Line Club out one more time to correct this mistake.   Food tasted great before the ants were discovered in the drink.  Service was good, not great."}
{"text":"Good food and a easy friendly service. Plus how many places can you say have real live hockey players walking through the restaurant while you dine."}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab some food before the game last night and this was a great choice. I ordered the garbage plate and it was more than I could handle! Huge portion of fries topped with two burger patties, mac & cheese, chili & onions, and maybe more, I'm not sure. I'd get it again but I'd make sure this was my only meal of the day. One of my friends I was with ordered a philly cheese steak and he liked it. Another ordered the chicken strips. They weren't bad, but they were just Bojangles and were overpriced at $12 since you can basically get the same thing for $5 at the concession stands."}
{"text":"Ok another shot at the redline club. Tonite for checkers game. Catherine was our server and it took only 5 minutes to be waited on and another 5 to get our drinks. So Service is much better. Never brought our appetizer but also did not charge us for it. 3 so so burgers. Overall better than last time, but still has a ways to go to improve."}
{"text":"We had the brunch buffet before a Charlotte Checkers game.  We arrived when the club opened at 11:30 and were seated promptly.  It took a long time for a waitress to come to our table. By that point, several parties who had been seated after us were already in the food line.  The omelette station had about 6 orders lined up ahead of me.  When it was delivered to my table, it looked like an egg white omelette, which is not what I ordered.  A table mate had the same experience with his omelette.  They ran out of bacon on the buffet line and it took about 5-7 minutes before it was replenished.  They ran out of biscuits on the buffet line.  How does a restaurant in a building named for Bojangles run out of biscuits?  We were told that no more biscuits would be available the rest of the day.  Both food shortages occurred within 30 minutes of the restaurant opening.   Despite being told that biscuits would not be available, they were brought out about 30 minutes later. By then, I was done with my meal.  The last issue came with my check. There was a 20% surcharge added to my bill. When I asked my waitress what it was for, she told me that it was the gratuity that was shared among all the workers.  Nowhere on the menu did it state that the gratuity was included.  While I normally tip 20% anyway, it's just not right to include it without disclosing it.

Oh yeah, the food.  For a buffet, it was OK. The beef tips and fish were surprisingly good.  The sausage patties were good too.  The bacon, once it came out, was undercooked.  I think the next time, I'll eat at the Bojangles across the street."}
