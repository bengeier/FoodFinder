{"text":"Wife and I took visiting friends to dinner. Sorry to say the food was less than appetizing . Our dinners arrived cold and two orders were wrong. The service was slow and our waitress was not very friendly. We were embarrassed due to the fact that we boasted the popularity of the restaurant and its excellent food suggested to us by another patron. Very disappointing, will not return. Didn't even get an apology for order mix up or cold food!"}
{"text":"If microwaved rolls and a leftover baked potato are your thing, then you have found the perfect place. 
The decor is dated and shabby. 
They have given up."}
{"text":"First time diner. Made reservations. Seated immediately. I ordered prime rib. My wife ordered scallops. Absolutely wonderful meal. Great side dishes, attentive staff. I'd go back in a heartbeat. 
Restaurant has an old time feel"}
{"text":"To be clear on my review. As someone active in the industry, I find it insulting for my server to assume that I came in looking for a free meal. First off, I DIDN'T EAT MY MEAL, THERE WAS HAIR IN IT!
Secondly, when this happens where I work, we don't insult our guest by taking $8 off a $28.99 meal, we comp it....for it had two hairs on two different plates of food, witch leaves me to think there was hair everywhere if I had two for two. There should have been no questions asked. 
My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meal, a la carte btw, but I stand by my feelings of a very overpriced, very underwhelming three item- two side buffet."}
{"text":"I took my mother here for Mother's Day. I grew up coming here a few times a year with my parents. We haven't been here since the late 70s. I was glad when I realized it was still here and thought how nice it would be to take my mom. I have such fond memories of coming here. The food was always good. I know this place was always pricey but I was in shock when I saw the price for the buffet. $29 per person! That price was ridiculous especially for the handful of items on the buffet. My husband got the buffet and was very disappointed with the limited choices. Food was good except the pasta was cold he said. My mom and I both ordered the lamb chops. They were  $16.95 and didn't come with anything. If you wanted a salad, potato, or some green beans, add another  $4 for each. I ordered the salad with French dressing that is supposed to have blue cheese crumbles in it. There were no crumbles, just barely crumbs. I mean tiny, tiny specks. My mom and I both ordered hot tea. They didn't have any tea spoons on the table so I asked for some and was given large soup spoons. I then asked specifically for a tea spoons for my small cup of tea and was brought an ice tea spoon. Seriously?  You don't have spoons? They only had two choices for children, chicken tenders or burger both with fries. My son's burger was almost $15! The prices are like the prices I pay when eating out in Manhattan. There was nothing in our meal to justify what they charged. Our bill was almost $150 and no one had any kind of alcohol.  It was nice to go down memory lane, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here for the past 20 years and have never had a bad meal.
If there is a problem the wait staff will take care of it right away.
This restaurant is the place that your  Grand Parents went to in the 50'and 60's on their date nights. You might be the youngest couple there on a Friday night.
It is a great place to get a stiff drink and an awesome prime rib.
The prime rib is the best in North East Ohio and is always good.
Part of the charm of this place is that they make homemade banana cream pie and other things that you won't find in a chain.
If you like prime rib this is the place."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to the restaurant in years decided to give it a try , it has completely changed . Worst meal EVER !!! It ruined our entire day . Poor selection of food ,  it was like putting slop on a plate,  atmosphere was terrible  they sat us behind a door and we kept getting hit by it . When we called the manager to explain he was rude and could careless . Was way over priced we could have went to a fast food restaurant and had a better meal and time !!! If I could give No Stars that would be too many !!! 
Don't go to this restaurant it will disappoint you !!!!"}
{"text":"Ugh, very over priced for the entire experience. Very dated inside. Poorly trained staff who wear their stress on their sleeves. Utilize many, many convenience ingredients. Salads with iceberg lettuce, cold, dry rolls, deep fried breaded dinners. Prices on drinks were good."}
{"text":"My wife and I attended a dinner event at Hellriegel's, and it was our first time there. We were not impressed. The salad was mainly iceberg lettuce, which is fine, but the dressing was very bland. The rolls were not fresh baked. 

We did not have a choice on dinner, but were served green beans, baked chicken, and rice. The food was OK. Fairly bland.

Maybe it's better if we just go for dinner? Not sure we're going to give it a try tho. Sorry to say."}
{"text":"Have not been there in years and it seems like this is true for every one else.
I should have know this was not going to be a good experience when there were only three tables seated during the dinner hour. also overheard the barmaid say to our waiter \"Well at least you'll have more than one customer tonight\"

Wife' seafood platter was cold when served, my prime rib was tasteless for other than salt. even the home fries with gravy were to salty to eat.

only good thing was the homemade Banana Cream Pie.

won't make this mistake again!."}
{"text":"I remember Hellriegel's to be a beautiful place, elegant with great food and service....Well that was then and this is now! After several years away, today I tried the Sunday Breakfast Buffet. Not only will I NOT RECOMMEND the cold, old hash brown potatoes or the cold bland pre-made pancakes or the watered down orange juice. I was highly disappointed with the service as well. When asked about the meal, we told the waitress we were less than satisfied. My entire meal was in front of me with only one taste of each item because it was not edible. She said nothing, no manager came to speak with us and nothing was taken off the bill. I had to go home & make breakfast...What a waste of time & money. I will not return! Good luck to those that do try!"}
{"text":"Definately Overhyped!  Opulent Prices, Average Everything! :(
I was glad I had the coupon from the yellow pages online for a $15 discount.  Still disappointed for the price.   The cuts of prime rib were probably twice the thickness of other places.  The chef could not get them well done after 3 tries.  My wife was seated next to the beautiful fireplace, but,  was unable to move her chair for comfort due to the fireplace brick on the floor.  My wife's onion rings were inedible to her due to the amount of grease.  A baked potato was graciously substituted at no charge.  The anniversary cake was less than optimal. Often had to wait for the service to appear.  The rowdy regulars at the bar, ruined the mood and the ambiance.  Went home full, but, Overall, a big disappointment for our first try there."}
