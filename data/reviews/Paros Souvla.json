{"text":"very friendly staff, the food is always great it is certainly a better version of opa! the prices although are alot higher than opa but it is worth it ... if you're after a quick greek bite I would try this place's roasted lamb with potates!"}
{"text":"This place is the most delicious Greek food I have ever tried yet. The guys are such wonderful, and always in a fantastic mood. Everything on their menu is to die for... Everything is just made fresh, and made with love. This is nothing like Opa, please don't compare these two.. Try this and you will thank me forever."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best! Tasty! Affordable!  Greek food in Cow Town! Well prepared, presented and staff are super friendly and the cooks know their stuff. This is my go to Greek restaurant or take out for sure. :)"}
{"text":"As a barber I don't have a lot of time to eat, so with that said this place is by far the best and freshest food you can get in the Royal oak plaza. The staff and owners are amazing people. If you want great food and are sick of eating garbage this place is for you!"}
{"text":"A colleague recommended Paros to me because she's a fan of their resto in Airdrie.  If you like OPA! Souvlaki you will LOVE Paros.   We tried the lamb platters - one with a side of greek salad and one with potatoes. Real pieces of feta on the greek side salad, 'real' greek potato sides, and tzakiki sauce that tastes like yogurt.  Lots of garlic flavour. Real pieces of lamb - not just little cubes of meat.  Fluffy pita - like angel's wings - (sorry for rhapsodizing but it was SO yummy).  Everything is tasty, fresh and packed with mediterranean goodness.  I hear the calamari is good too.  Can't wait to go back or check out the dining experience in Airdrie.  The service and atmosphere is what you'd expect in a take-out.  It was a bit quiet when we were there on a Sunday afternoon.  Food:  9/10 Service: 9/10 Atmosphere: 7/10  Question:  When will there be a Paros in my neighbourhood or near my work?  It can't happen too soon."}
{"text":"Very clean but small eating area. Fast and friendly counter service. Food was prepared quickly and smells delicious. Chicken Souvla platter was a bit oily for my taste, but well seasoned. Only drawback was they were out of lamb that day, which I was really hoping to try. All in all a great place to grab some quality Greek food at an okay price. Going to make my daughter order the calamari next time, as I hear it is mighty fine."}
{"text":"Great service .....Great food......Will keep you going back for more......nothing like I have ever had before...... Opa should watch out if these guys open another location ......."}
{"text":"Yuck. Very over-priced and the food has no Greek flavour. Opa is WAY better for fast food style Greek."}
{"text":"Calamari is superb.  I found the pork overcooked and dry.  Decent food small place but it needs a double door entrance as it is gets a cool breeze."}
{"text":"I love this place. It makes the family happy, it's affordable, and fast (for takeout). It looks a bit unassuming but the food packs a punch. Clear winners are the spanokopita, soulva chicken plate, all wraps, the calamari. Also, the food doesn't have preservatives so people like my daughter (with a corn allergy) can get whatever she wants."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken souvla plate with a split of rice and potatoes for the side. So much amazing food packed into one dish. I always know I will be satisfied if I order from here, and I'm greeted with a smile every time I pick up my order. These guys deserve 6 stars for their passion and consistency!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing.   You could tell that they took the time to make the meal they served the absolute best.  Unfortunately that also means it took a little while to get your food so it's probably not the best place if you are in a hurry.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They took the time to explain the menu to me and made some good suggestions as to what I should try if I've never eaten there before."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best Greek food at an affordable price, this place is it. My boyfriend lives nearby, and one day we decided to try out Paros. We were blown away by the quality and it's not gotten any worse since.  Our usual go-to is the lamb plate with greek fries and a half side of calamari. Sometimes we'll get the saganaki (fried cheese basically), but it's a bit heavier. The total comes to just over $30, which is great for two people given the level of quality.  The lamb plate comes with roasted lamb, four pieces of toasted pita, roasted vegetables, tzatziki, and the upgraded greek fries. The lamb is always incredibly tender and delicious, and the pitas are perfectly toasted. I love roasted vegetables in general, so the addition of those just makes the meal for me. It's quite a bit of food, so my boyfriend and I just share one plate. With the half size of calamari it's plenty of food for both of us.   I must also mention the amazing service of the staff. All of them have always been so friendly each time, so I think they just hire genuinely nice people. As well, even though this is a \"fast casual\" type place, they bring the food out to you; however, this last time, the fellow that brought our food out went back to the utensils rack and got the both of us a fork and knife with napkins. Seriously, this place is amazing."}
{"text":"I love the gyros wraps from this place. Have eaten here twice, once take out and once sit in. It was mad busy when I went in on a Friday night and a long wait for a table (it's a tiny place) and our food. But once you get it it's delicious. I've tried the pork, beef and lamb and they're all top notch. The fries when dining in are so crispy and well seasoned and the side of tzatziki is quite generous. Will keep coming back but probably at a less busy time."}
{"text":"First time to visit Paros Souvlas in Royal Oak.  An excellent meal of great, healthy food.  I'll definitely visit often."}
{"text":"The food here was great. The portions are big and it was really yummy. Loved the potatoes, tzatziki sauce. It doesn't have a lot of seats but they are quick and you can always take away."}
{"text":"We ordered to go and was so impressed that its made at time of order! Fresh, quick and very friendly staff. We ordered a few different things so we can sample the menu since it was our first time having food from this  new Greek joint. Everything was delicious! I wish we would have ordered more, defiantly will next time. The  tzatziki is to die for. Fresh and authentic. Can't wait to go back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Excellent greek food, very fresh tasting. The chicken souvlaki were cooked so tender and everything together tasted great. Only downside is the location, all the way northwest, but other than that I really liked it. I only hope all the ingredients are as fresh and simple as they taste!"}
{"text":"How can anyone say that this 'fast-food' Greek fare is good? Well, if never have had excellent Greek and your tastebuds are in your armpits, then simply won't know the difference! Bit of a stretch, but if it's not good Greek, one has to say so. I'd give it 2.5 but their many exaggerated claims to it being really good don't bear up! When compared to My Greek Plate in Cochrane or Broken Plate in Willow Park, the contrast is evident. Check them out before you amp up the stars on this lame dog? Upon returning 2x after the first and more pleased visit, I came to know that hype plays a part in Paros Souvia that in my enthusiasm I'd overlooked the first time. As they are opening more shops in the city, perhaps they will have improved it somewhat (newest is at 8th St. & 15th Ave. SW just down from 17th Ave.). One thing that was super-jarring? French-fried potatoes - fries! - in a pita filled with gyro or souvlaki meat and sauces? What strange flavours and textures, not at all impressed! Terrible idea, and the contrasted tastes attest to it. Must be some spin-off from poutine, but strange strange. How to rate this place. It wasn't not all that good the last two times, but still is better than most fast food that I usually rate 0 or 1 star if I must."}
{"text":"8th street location review.   Good Greek food. Great portion sizes for men! I would order from here again however I didn't get to finish much of my meal as it was delivered To me drowning in Feta Cheese and I have instruction for EASY / LIGHT ON THE FETA! I'm not a huge fan of it. I tossed most of the food but the stuff I tasted seemed good. I had a platter and a side salad. PS- Greek fries means they have lots of feta on them not just Greek seasoning like other places however when you order in the Skip app it Doesn't tell you that."}
{"text":"Paros Souvla always bring me back to my travels in Greece. The smell, the spices, the crisp in the fresh vegetables, and the creamy saltiness of the feta. Paros does an amazing job bringing out the best in Greek cuisine.  The pork souvlaki gyro and the saganaki are my faves.   Definitely 1000% worth the visit if you're in Calgary.   And it's family owned. !!!"}
{"text":"This place is honestly better than most sit down Greek restaurants. The younger staff is always super friendly and the cooking never disappoints. My only issue is that there isn't more locations! Lamb plate is amazing and their Greek salad is F*@&ing bomb"}
{"text":"Get the calamari. I went to Paros solely based on the Yelp reviews. The chicken wrap was good - saucy and packed full of meat and veggies. The only thing I didn't like about the wrap was the fries were overcooked and cold.   The calamari batter was light, not oily and it melted on your tongue. The squid was tender and came in toothsome rings. The squid was so good, I went back and ordered another half portion."}
{"text":"I came upon Paros Souvla while driving around the still developing shopping/eating area near the Royal Oak neighbourhood.   The restaurant is small, with maybe 15 tables. You order at the counter for either eat-in or take out. As the food takes longer to prepare than standard fast-food greek, the staff brought the food to our table after waiting a few minutes.  The menu has (or at least seems to have) a fairly authentic greek offering, with more than the standard \"greek\" salad. For $12, I ordered one the the \"plates\" which comes with choice of meat, choice of side, grilled veggies, pita and tzatziki. I tried the chicken souvla and the pilos salad. The chicken was juicy and flavourful. The salad was a chopped salad of sorts with a very fresh dressing. I especially enjoyed the thick pita and dip. The portions were generous and I left full.  I will definitely visit this business again. as multiple visits are required to try all the meat and side options that the restaurant prepares."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken platter was yummy amaz9ng.  A bit soppy on the chicken cuz im a diva and need everything fresh pounded and beaten esp for me.   Gf had fried zuchini..which tasted like poro snacks...yummy"}
{"text":"Good if you are looking for a good Greek place nearby! I like to always tell people that it's kind of like Opa, but a little bit better and a little bit pricier.   Potatoes are super good here! Cute little space inside, but not a ton of sitting space. Since it's in the neighbourhood though, I would even recommend getting it to go and eating at home if you live close by. The cashier was extremely helpful and patient with me the first time I visited.   Parking lot here is a little bit weird; you may or may not find parking near the restaurant and walk a little."}
{"text":"Compared to the price, the potion is small. You can get the same portion with lower price at OPA! It is a friendly place but the prices are not reasonable. I personally don't recommend."}
{"text":"Yay!  Some delicious greek food close to home. Loving the new places going into Royal Oak landing and this is one of the very newest.   My first impression of establishment when entering was another OPA! with a better designer.  Thankfully,  ordering style and the cooking line  and the general flow of the menu is the last of the reminders of a subpar greek chain.  Paros Soulva is really fresh,  bursting with flavour and high quality for a \"food fair\" type service.   The only thing weird is eating such good food with plastic forks - it could easily be served in a good quality table service establishment with an inflated price.   This place has been open a week - I've been in twice already!  At first the menu confused me,  and the cashier was new so we bumbled through it together but I've got it figured out now.    My first trip I got a veggie souvlaki plate which is a skewer of roasted veggies served with a side (lemon potatoes for me, pita, tzatziki and roasted vegetables.  A skewer of veggies has a HIGH potential of being very boring but it was executed wonderfully as it was seasoned to perfection.  Each element of the plate had a unique, bold and wonderful flavour.  I have to say I am totally in love with the lemon potatoes - very much a powerful lemon flavour but missing the acidity and it wasn't too sour.   I've had a bite of the rice which was also nice and tried some fries  which are alright but a bit too crunchy for my tastes.  The greek pita is so good - I'm not sure if they are making it there but it's so fresh and moist while still browned on the grill as expected.   I would be so surprised if the tzatziki is not freshly made there -  some of the best I've had in a long time. Really the only negative things to say about the veggie plate is that it was very heavy (no fat free dieter allowed here)  and that the roasted veggies featured eggplant which is not a veggie I like that much (in fairness,  I ate them because they were still prepared well).    We finished off with Bougatsa which is a creamy custard filled phyllo pastry sprinkled with white sugar and cinnamon.  These things are HUGE -  Easily shared by two and possibly 4 if you want just a small sweet treat.   I really enjoyed it  but I certainly didn't need a full portion like I had ordered for myself unaware of the size.    Trip two I got a veggie wrap,  shared the spanakopita and an order of pita and tzatziki with some baklava to go.  The veggie wrap was yummy but I liked it less than the full plate.  I like the amount of food better - it's a smaller meal but the roasted veggies were moist and added tzatziki made it very messy and drippy.   The pita wrap was probably the best part -  just love them - but the filling was all very good.  Maybe there is a better strategy to eat the wrap (even if it's just eating the filling a bit with a fork first) to make it a better experience.  The spanakopita is good - it's a large square shape making it softer than the small triangle style alternatives. The pastry was moist but the spinach wasn't over moist which is the other extreme.  It's a fairly large portion and it doesn't come with tzatziki so I was glad to already have some to go with it.   Baklava was good - very nutty and more so than some others I can think of but well prepared.  I think I prefer the bougatsa though if I have someone to share with.  prices for this and the other food were reasonable  but a touch high for the typical food fair style food - good thing it's much higher quality making it a bit of a deal! :)  As a vegetarian I've made it this far while glossing over the Soulva - which is spit roasted meats and kind of one of their main things.  My fianace tells me these are fantastic  - I find it interesting you can order it by the 1/4, 1/2 and full KG.  That's a lot of meat and it doesn't come with sides!  The pricing of it seems reasonable but I'm guessing you'd have to have a number of people to share those larger portions while ordering some sides to go along with it.    Service here is good even though minimal service levels are expected in this style of dining.  I'm thinking the majority of the cooks are owners and maybe related.  They have really gone out of their way to make the experience a nice one and are invested in the food being successful.   Table service doesn't seem to be the operational plan but a number of things were served to us.   I love the food here and the only think I love more is that it's close to me.  Opa across the street is in for a world of hurt now that they are on the scene. The only wish was the food was lighter with less oil for the health reasons and so I can justify coming here a bit more often.   Totally give this place a try, the menu says they offer delivery but didn't specify the range."}
{"text":"Best Calamari in town!  The wraps are awesome and you can tell how much care and love these guys put into their food. All the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable.  Every time I drive by I want to go in."}
{"text":"Great Greek meal, everything made fresh in front of you! May seen a little pricey but I think it's worth it for locally sourced and authentic Greek ingredients. The lamb is good, good calamari too. The house dressing was nice, light and fresh tasting. Had takeout, but the restaurant seemed nice, clean and definitely new. Will return I'm sure!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh and wholesome Greek food!  We ordered the Roasted Lamb Plate with Paros Salad and another of the same plate but with the rice.  The plates all came with pita bread, tzatziki sauce and roasted vegetables.  Best roasted lamb I've ever had!!  Everything we ordered was soooooooo good!    We ordered to go and watched these 3 guys cook up our dinner and was so impressed!  I saw their deep-fried calamari being made and I decided to order a full order of the calamari.  It was the best decision ever!!  Truly, truly, tender and moist  calamari topped with onion and their wonderful tzatziki sauce!!    Guys, you outdid yourselves!!  Fantasticos!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Our favourite little Greek spot! Amazing taste, value, and quite speedy. Think fast food meets the slow/real food movement. We love going there!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. I had the lamb, it was tender and delicious. And they got the tzatziki right!"}
{"text":"Paros souvlaki is some of the best food I have had in a long time. The vegetables are fresh, plenty of food, and their meat is some of the most exquisite I have had, ever. The manager mentioned that the meat is marinated for 12 hours...not your typical out of the freezer meal you'd find at any other fast food place. Staff is friendly, place is clean. Paros will be having my business for many meals to come!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken souvlaki platter with village salad ($13.50). The chicken was tender and flavorful, the salad was great even without dressing (thanks to a slab of feta and generous sprinkle of oregano), and the pita bread was hot and soft. The only disappointment was that the roasted peppers were slightly oily. Also, the portion size was a little small for the price (i.e. no leftovers, even at lunch). Service was prompt and friendly, and I'll definiltey be back."}
{"text":"It's actually hilarious that I'm giving a fast-food restaurant 5 stars prior to giving the other 10-15 fine dining restaurants in Calgary that I adore, 5 stars. That being said, they totally deserve it. Like how is this even a thing? It's reasonably priced food. Made within 5-10 minutes. And CONSISTENTLY DELICIOUS. Plus they're right down the road from me which pretty much puts them over the top.  Damn girl."}
{"text":"Living so far away from the city Centre it's hard to find good food made with fresh and healthy ingredients, Paros is a little gem in the NW and only a 5 minute drive from home! The chicken souvla is my favourite dish, the chicken is always juicy. I always get it with the village salad, I love the large slice of feta that comes on top. Best taziki in the city! This is a great meal if your conscience of keeping carbohydrates to a minimum, as a diabetic this is ideal. The only reason I gave it 4 Stars is because they are a little pricey."}
{"text":"I love this place as its close to home and makes the best calamari in Calgary! The batter is light, the squid is tender and the tzatziki is amazing.    I also like the lamb and the chicken and the soft, warm pita bread. Salads are very fresh and light tasting without the overpowering flavour of onions which happens at many places- here, it's well balanced.  Very friendly service and the guys are great at remembering their clientele. Not much seating but they are quick. Thank you for opening up a place in our neighbourhood!!!"}
{"text":"You know that feeling when you're so hungry you're passed the hangry stage and you think you're about to die? Well, that was me until I found Paros.  I wanted a quick meal as fast as possible and Paros saved my life... Well, maybe my day.  The food at Paros was really awesome. It was very filling and had a homemade quality to it. I felt like I was eating at my imaginary Greek grandma's house!   After I was revived! I realized that I am willing to spare to no expense to live another day but truthfully Paros was kinda pricey for a fast food place. It's fancier than your other franchises like OPA but it's not a restaurant but has restaurant-like prices.   I got a platter which was a decent size for $15. I thought it was pricey for a platter, maybe it's the recession or something, I just thought I would get more bang for my buck. It came with a pita, roasted veggies, rice and lamb. The roasted veggies consisted of green peppers and artichokes were my favourite because it tasted like it was fresh off the grill and really ushered in the spring season for me."}
{"text":"Finally we have an original and authentic Greek gyro place in Calgary. One thing I have always missed from Greece is the food and now thanks to the guys at Paros we have it here in YYC. I had the gyro/pork wrap to start that is served up with some seriously fresh vegetables-ingredients and a mouthwatering Tzatziki. I can not stress enough that in Calgary although there are some good Greek places nothing is as authentic and spot on like Paros. From the way they wrap the pitas and using real Greek style pita bread to putting fries inside the wrap (Greek) and adding a touch of paprika. The food is simply outstanding. I also tried the spanakopita which is definitely homemade and not the generic/frozen stuff that comes from a wholesale store. The spanakopita was filled with a generous amount of feta cheese and a hint of dill. Lastly I had the Greek fries that were covered in feta cheese, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkles of oregano. OMG this place is as best as it gets. From the food to the service, Paros gets full marks."}
{"text":"If you don't live in NW Calgary, find some excuse to visit the Royal Oak area and hit this place!  It is seriously that amazing!!!    You order from the counter and then get served your meal. The menu board is quite varied with traditional Souvlas and Souvlaki plates, pita wraps, and also Spit roasted meat.   I tried the Lamb Souvla-Ah-mazing!  Soooo tender it just melted in my mouth. My plate contained pillowy pita, tender roasted potatoes and veg plus tzatziki sauce.  All found there way quickly into my belly.  My husband had the same but with chicken-equally tender and delish.      I will be back-you should go too!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious- no issues at all there.  Portion size is adequate but you don't get as much food here as you would at other Greek places.  I've come in before for the gyros and a side of fries and they hit the spot for lunch and at a reasonable price, about $10.  I went in for an early dinner the other day and I settled on a chicken souvlaki plate/platter and here is where it got confusing- in a platter you get a choice of meat with bread and tatziki...they include grilled mixed veg as well alongside the chicken skewer. Very good, they were a nice addition.  So there are a few sides to chose from to accompany the aforementioned, they are fries, baked potato, rice or one of two kinds of house salads. The thing is you only get one of these sides and if you upgrade to a Greek salad you have to pay a buck more. Isn't the Greek salad something that is usually a standard side with the meat, bread and tatziki? Most Greek places offer a potato and/or rice as the side and you are not charged extra.   Also many places give you extra olives at no charge, here they were an additional $2! I was not aware of these extra charges till after I paid. BTW I only wanted a couple extra olives, $2 seems excessive.  I needed some rice or potato so settled on the fries.  They were an additional $3.50 and the serving size was quite small, (I'd say about 15 fries) on the plus side they are home style and they give you a bigger side of tatziki with them than you get with the actual meal.   The tatziki was good but a little heavy handed on the garlic and lacking on the cucumber.    I added a beverage and was just over $20.    Don't get me wrong, the guys that work there look like they are family and I was happy to see true Greeks running the place- the authenticity was spot on flavour and the Greek salad topped with the real deal feta was excellent, you can tell it was imported, not like the garbage you get from your run of the mill grocery store; but to pay to upgrade to a Greek salad at Greek restaurant makes no sense.  86 the nickel and diming please.  Paying over $6 for fries, a few extra olives and a salad 'upgrade' that should be included in the meal is tacky.  Add either a rice or potato with the meal and I'm sure that the place would be busier.  Unfortunately, it was on the pricier side for Greek takeout.  They also had two desert offerings but I would have been over $25 if I indulged! Eeeeek!  3.5 stars.  Very good food but quantity has to match the quality for a $20+ dinner."}
