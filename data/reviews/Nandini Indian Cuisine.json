{"text":"Authentic Indian food (I think it is anyway, definitely yummy). Delicious and a great price. We went here on a Sunday and ate the buffet. Would recommend coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a big Zero...bad food ( worst Indian food I tried in the US )...Never try the Tomato soup here.

P.S :  came in here for dinner..!!"}
{"text":"Most flavorful and tender Tandoori chicken. The Indian cottage cheese in spinach was perfect balance to moderately spice chicken. Great service."}
{"text":"Damn you Yelp for not letting me give zero stars to these swill pedlars . 
Horrible horrible goat biriyani ... Rather than this Godforsaken crap excuse of a biriyani , you are better served to use your $15 dollars to wipe your hind side after a good bowel movement.
May be a great place for naive Americans, who have no idea how biriyani tastes like, to eat this gastronomical disaster.
I cry for humanity on behalf of all those who've rated this septic tank four and a half stars. 

Owners , please go back to serving the swill that sells chicken tikka masala out of a Sysco bucket. Biriyani isn't your cup of tea ... even by a long shot!!!"}
{"text":"Best North Indian food that we have found in the east valley. Delicious spices, great variety in the lunch buffet. Includes fresh garlic nann delivered to your table, as well as chai tea and mango lassi."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place by accident, one day. The first time was good, I had the tasty Indian food staple of [chicken] tikka masala, and they spiced it to my taste. The server recommended that we try their daily buffet (11a-2:30pm) the next time we came, so about a month and a half later we did so. No disappointment, here! The buffet has a good mix of items to choose from, and the atmosphere is laid-back yet nice. I will agree with a previous reviewer that there could be some improvements to said atmosphere (mostly all the brown accents, yuck), but it isn't something that detracts from the overall experience.

The service here is top-notch. The waiter (seems like there's only the one guy, as we had him both times and it looks like he was servicing every table in the place both times) is exceedingly nice and always at-the-ready with a smile and something engaging to say. 

Definitely give this place a try if you're driving down Broadway and looking for some eats."}
{"text":"Very yummy chicken curry and chicken tandoori.  The butter nan bread was delicious too!!"}
{"text":"The food is the best Indian cuisine I've had in the East Valley in years! Wonderful! Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"We went for dinner with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised!  Good food and service.  The shrimp tikka masala and shrimp tikki masala were great!  very flavorful and big portions.  The Garlic naan was really good too.   I took half mine home for next days' lunch.   I asked about the rice and once I understood it was an additional price, we went for the veggie biryani which complemented the meal.  I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"I tend to get the same thing each time: palak paneer (spinach + cheese) and spicy vindaloo, garlic naan. I really should branch out but these two dishes are so good at Nandini....the lamb is tender, good cuts, ample serving... not chewy. Cheese isn't spongy but silky and the spinach has a kick to it. 

I go out of my way to come here, plus the owner & staff are super nice, make you feel welcome! I came here by myself tonight and had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"My friends and I went in for dinner. Simply loved the food.
We ordered Palak Paneer and Paneer tikka masala, and both were great."}
{"text":"I was just crossing from the streets and came across the place.

Good is average. Only Panner was yummy as per me.

Sweets were really good. I wouldn't want to come back but wouldn't avoid if I was near by."}
{"text":"The staff was freindly. I have been to many indian food places and this is by far the best. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"I really love the food in here,me and my hubby always go there,specially there chicken tikka masala and butter naan.And there service is good!"}
{"text":"Good shahi paneer, chicken makhani, and garlic naan. Good and friendly service. Good came out quickly! The buffet is not as good as ordering individual items."}
{"text":"Went with a colleague for lunch buffet last week. Arrived early and the place was quite empty. So we get to eat the first/fresh food out of the kitchen. I like it that way. 

The items were all tasty and the variety they offer for $6.99 buffet is awesome. The guy who waited on us was constantly checking on us and was very attentive. The place was decent (not much decoration though). Place did not smell bad or anything like some reviewers mentioned. 

This is the first time I ever reviewed a restaurant; I am from India and can tell this is authentic Indian food. I was writing this so other folks can check them out while the price is still 6.99 for lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Oh my! AMAZING! I have tried most of the indian restaurants in the tempe area and this is by far the best option. Especially for the price! 

Favorites include the chicken tikka masala and chicken saag (medium spice) with garlic naan and rice. But I'm sure everything is amazing! 

If you like indian food (or even if you are not sure) GO HERE! You will not regret it. They even have some indian beer for you to try as well, if that's your kinda thing."}
{"text":"Curry dishes are great. The curry goat was was well seasoned and not too spicy. Still not a fan of the buffet but ordering from the menu during dinner was a much better experience."}
{"text":"Gave it a shot! Phoenix has some decent buffet style Indian restaurants, this is not one of them. This is an ordinary a la carte Indian restaurant at least for dinner service where each dish can probably feed a person or leave just enough room for dessert after. Food quality was somewhat authentic, a bit westernized but hey it's Phoenix and people here judge food based on their trashy idea of what they think butter chicken and tikka are supposed to taste like. Vindaloo sauce was near perfect and the tikka wasn't bad. 

If you're in the area and craving Indian food, it's probably one of the best Indian places you'll be able to find.

8/10 for food.
7/10 for service and speed."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by accident craving Indian Food one night. Absolutely delicious! Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Makhani, pea rice, naan bread and raita. So good I can't wait to come back! There is nothing like this in Scottsdale. It's worth leaving the bubble for any day."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great service. We went late (around 9pm) the atmosphere was casual and the food came out quickly.  Some of the best Indian food I've had in a while.  We tried both the vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"The food is definitely amazing. And i would absolutely eat here again.
BUT, just a little upset. I ordered for a to go, and had someone else pick it up. When I got to it I realized they ADDED items to my order, and I was CHARGED for them.
 Also, to go food  was HALF what you get in the restaurant, yet not half the price you pay..."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!!! Chicken deca Madela and lamb were amazing! Garlic naan great too. Good service!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Fantastic price, fantastic food, fantastic service. Wish it was closer to my house, I would go every week."}
{"text":"This was my favorite indian buffet of all time. The quality is very good, and there's a nice selection. In addition to staples like tandoori chicken & dahl curry, I was pleasantly surprised to see things like chicken tikka masala and chicken vindaloo, as well...on the buffet! The naan bread was also great. I love that they brought it out hot and fresh to every guest, rather have a pile of it sitting under heat lamps.  On top of the great food, it's super cheap. If you like Indian food, do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food and great service. Wife and I had delicious samosas as an appetizer. The portions were a bit on the small side but it was still excellent and filling. My only qualm was that rice was extra, I expected that it would be included with the meal. Overall a great place, would recommend!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was amazing food was fresh and full of flavor and it was very inexpensive I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try a new restaurant !"}
{"text":"I've never had anyone come after me for posting my experience on here, but it won't stop with this guy, he's abusive if you get on his bad side, everyone can make up their own mind. Here's his latest message to me:

\"Please be ready to get attacked if you try to be unreasonable.We also do not want to serve you if you are mistaking our hospitality our weakness or an olive branch. In fact customers like you hardly matters to any business as you do not want solution but your own ego satisfaction
We dispatch more than ten to go orders everyday and have never received any such complaints.so your feedback is highly exaggeration and ridiculous.and now GOODBYE cry baby.\" -Satnam S."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this place since it had so many positive reviews,  and for the most part I was very pleased with the food. We got the the chicken Tika masala, shrimp tandoori,  basmati rice, and garlic nan.  The shrimp tandoori was AMAZING. Sweet, sour, and spicey with tons of peppers and onions and large marinated shrimp. The restuarant deserves 5 stars for this dish alone. However, the chicken Tika masala , while it has a nice flavor, was dry and the sauce was very thick for my liking. The garlic nan was delicious, but disappointingly the rice was dry like the chicken, and tasted old. 

Overall I would order from here again just for the tandoori shrimp alone, and probably just stick with the nan or request fresh rice."}
{"text":"My first time trying Indian food and it was absolutely amazing! I got the chicken tikka masala, side of yogurt & rice, and naan. All very good and the chicken tikka masala had the perfect amount of spice"}
{"text":"A MUST VISIT!!!! 

Went here for the first time today. We ordered Tandoor chicken, vegetable biryani, and the ever popular garlic nann bread. Oh AND dessert the fried dough in sweet syrup (the name escapes me). ALL the dishes were DELICIOUS! and the portions are definitely FAMILY style. SO MUCH FOOD!!! SHARE SHARE SHARE! This place is definitely one we are returning to. We will further explore the menu again ;) 

The service was great and I think the server was pleased to see how much we were enjoying the meals."}
{"text":"Try masala tea and malai kofta..  Its really good. I always order from these place and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. My Wife and I got diarrhea after eating here. I do not know how to complain about this. Food wasn't great either as I have tried a lot of Indian food around. Ambience was pathetic as compared to the menu price( unchanged from an old rustic diner). lack servers and the cashier/server was hesitant to give a bowl box for curry, had to explain him how liquid curry will pour out of the box and how it requires a bowl. Will never go there again of course."}
{"text":"The food tasted good, but the service was rude. The real kicker though was the TWO cockroaches that crawled onto my table. EEEEEWW!!!"}
{"text":"One word amazing! We had the mushroom tandoori and it was to die for! We also had the chicken tikka and chicken spinach. All very authentic tastes."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times now. Weekdays and weekends, the food has always thrilled. The flavors of each dish is distinct and fresh. Cool dishes are cool warm dishes have the perfect warmth. Phenomenal. We're glad that it's close to our house but even if it wasn't. . We'd go wherever they where."}
{"text":"Delicious. Friendly. Authentic. The owner is extremely kind. He gave great recommendations and mentioned an affordable lunch buffet. I will definitely be coming back to try that."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly people. Eggplant was delicious and the best saag panzer I ever had. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Large variety of both vegetarian and meat dishes, which we need as a couple with one vegetarian and one meat-eater.  We ended up with the tandoori chicken and malai kofta.  Both were excellent.  Medium level of spice was about right for us; I was glad I hadn't gone for the next level.  The malai kofta  does not come with rice so when the waiter recommends it you should get it.  Garlic naan was fresh, and the vegetable samosas were perfect.  My favorite thing, though, was the mango lassi.   Just one little thing I would change - I don't care for Indian disco pop music, and would have taken a star off for that.  But my husband lobbied for five stars, because all he cares about is the food, and the food was really good."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet! Service was fabulous and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Chicken curry was good! My Nan bread was a bit burnt but overall this has been the best place to get Indian food around Phoenix."}
{"text":"A little hesitant, judging by the curb appeal. But it was totally worth it!!  Everything was fresh and flavorful. And the complimentary dessert was out of this world!  I have a new favorite:  Gulab Jamun!!"}
{"text":"Ate here years ago and happy to see that the quality hasn't really changed. The parathas are my favorite. I also find that the 'spicy' level is just about right for me (pretty spicy) i will return whenever in PHX."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, and this place doesn't disappoint. I had the food delivered and the food was absolutely wonderful. If you love Indian food like I do i would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Indian places all over the country and all over the world. I am pretty open to different flavors and interpretations of dishes but I have never had a worse Indian meal the here at Nandini. For starters the service was ok. Nothing great but nothing bad. We ordered a mango lassi and it was watery liquid so we Sent it back immediately. Next we ordered Butter chicken, lamb curry and paratha bread. The butter chicken sauce was manageable but the shredded chicken was ultra fatty and had bones. The lamb curry was utterly tasteless and beyond dry meat. The only part of the meal that was good was the paratha bread and the mint chutney. I highly advise anyone that sees the 4.5 stars DO NOT EAT HERE. Go to curry house or anywhere else. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious! Good quality food and awesome service. The chicken tikki masala was delicious with just the right amount of spice. Will be returning and trying their lunch buffet"}
{"text":"Great local Indian cuisine in Tempe.  The restaurant appears to be family run and they take pride in providing great service to all patrons.  The food is excellent and there is a great variety of dishes.  The owner had indicated to me that they offer a great lunch buffet with a great price but I have only been for diner, so I can't comment on the lunch.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Indian food that wants great value for their money at a local establishment."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places  to eat. I like dinner better than the lunch buffet.  But both are good. Place is clean. People  nice. And my chicken tikka masala was delicious and so was The Garlic noon."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options...especially enjoyed the cauliflower-potato combination.  Waiter was attentive and helpful.  Check hours before you go...we arrived a few minutes before 5pm and almost left...glad we stayed!"}
{"text":"I loved the chicken korma! Delicious! Great, friendly service, reasonable prices and daily buffet! Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"First, I have never seen Mango Lassi on a buffet before today. That is impressive. They have excellent tandoori chicken. There are about 8 entree items and 4 desert items to choose from on the buffet. I came here because they are the highest rated Indian Restaurant in Tempe. It is well deserved. I wish these guys were in my town."}
{"text":"This place was great! I especially like that the Paneer dish I ordered came with more pieces of paneer than I have received in dishes at other restaurants!"}
{"text":"I dont log in and write reviews, but this place was super delicious . I had garlic naan with chicken korma and i almost licked off the plate. Will be back for lunch buffet :)"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant during lunch for the first time and had the buffet. The mango lassie was super delicious and the food here was very good, hot, and affordable. The selection at the buffet was decent but I would have liked for lamb to have been available. Overall the experience was very nice, the waiters were pleasant, and the dining area was very spacious. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews, my wife and I decided to dine here one day following an exhausting 4000 mile driving trip from which had not yet fully recovered. We dined on the noon buffet which was very tasty, varied and well presented. The price was a promotional one for their recent opening ($15.15 with tax for two), Servers were very welcoming, attentive and engaging. The naan was especially good and the vindaloo was appropriately spicy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Incredible and authentic Indian food. I've been here several times and have always enjoyed a meal with friendly service. Nandini is definitely among my favorite restaurants in Tempe."}
{"text":"Thus place is great! the food was delicious and was about the same price as most Indian restaurants I've been to. I give It $$ only because it is more than a fast food place. The service deserves 10 stars, as it was so great. Friendly, quick and very generous. We were seated quickly and our food came quickly,  we were checked on multiple times. You can tell they appreciate the business and that's (I think) part of what you pay for."}
{"text":"High quality Indian food! A lot of Indiana places don't provide enough rice, but this one gave the perfect amount! The chicken saag was especially excellent. Wait staff is very nice."}
{"text":"The food is awesome it's fresh and cooked to perfection and the flavor is spot on. The chicken Marsala and tandoori chicken was amazing"}
{"text":"This food is simply amazing!!!! I've never tried Indian food before, but this was great. It's authentic Indian food and the menu is amazing. There is something for everyone on it. The place was casual and classy, and the staff was so friendly. I was visiting and when I come back to Arizona I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant. Yum."}
{"text":"I was working late one night at ASU and I was craving Indian Food.  I found this place on YELP and it was fantastic.  They make the best Chicken Vindaloo I have ever tasted.  I have been back four times in the last three weeks and have taken all my coworkers there.  I have gone to the buffet and they change up the items on occasion.  Everything is good."}
{"text":"Had a nice evening eating at Nandini with friendly, attentive service.  Their chicken pakora is delicious!"}
{"text":"We came across Nandini on Yelp while looking for a half-way place to meet friends that live in east valley.  Lots of good reviews helped us decide to give Nandini a try.  I'm happy to say the Yelp reviews were spot-on, Nandini is a great Indian restaurant!

Since I am new to Indian cuisine I'm not really qualified to provide an in depth critique of the food but I can say this - everything we ate was delicious!  Something I can comment on is their great service!  The owner was our server and he was really excited to see new faces at Nandini. He also seemed really pleased that the positive Yelp reviews are generating new business.

If you are like me and fairly new to Indian cuisine I highly recommend Nandini.  Their menu isn't overwhelming and has the english description of each dish so you won't be afraid to make a choice."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's halal too so the meat is even better quality. I recommend the Chicken Tiki Marshalla. It's a bit over salty for my exact tastes but still great. Rice is bomb and fresh, Naan is perfect. Mango lassi a great choice. Service is so sweet and attentive. Over all love it"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet for $6.95!!! Usually Indian Lunch Buffet are no less than $9 . They don't have a whole lot of variety, but enough to keep coming back. Place is really nice, spacious and clean. Service is good, by both elderly men that are really nice and fill your glasses promptly. Watch your step on way to buffet, I almost trip there every time, because of elevation in the floor. 

Bookmarked this as our new fav Indian lunch buffet. Coming back for sure!

If you need lot of variety or very picky about the food, you might not like it. Food is tasty IMO. Naan was really good too!

Update: Been there again for dinner. Same great service and tasty food. Naan bread was the best. My suggestion is to increase curry quantity. Thought its just a little than expected. I will come back for sure !!

Update: 02/21/2014 They increased the lunch buffet price. Not really happy about it. Not much meat either. I might not come back very often."}
{"text":"Hey Yall....Today i almost broke up with INDIAN FOOD, Let me start off by saying that this was the worst fucking  service of my life. I was given water no ice just a glass and water. I went to the buffet and lets just say the cupboard was bear. When I say it was barren of food, the moment that they brought one item out everybody rushed the buffet area. There was no rice, No masala chicken and a bunch of the s***. After my food was almost gone from  what I could savage up they brought me the famous garlic naan, which was naan existing. I asked for a sprite to wash down this mess and I was given a sour/salty concoction asked for the waitress to bring me a lemonade if possible she said ok. Only to  return to clean up a 15 + party mess and never return to me. Oh I forgot to say that I had to go to the bar area in order to order my drink. As I went to go pay the manager came and gave me another sprite and said sorry for your inconvenience.  Now I'm sitting here pissed off and hungry better yet I am hangry. I also have to remember get my palette is a different beast food doesn't have to be heavily season it just has to have flavor,  flavors of its enthic culture. Next question of the day is will she ever go back? NOT IN A BILLION f****** YEARS!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero star then I would! The staff are misleading, rude and the food is ok but way too $$$$ for food that looks like what I feed my dog. We wanted to try a new restaurant and what a bad mistake this restaurant is. The staff treats women with less respect, the employees walk around with poor hygiene and like they hate their job. They let a homeless man walk around while people are eating. I am fine with the man getting water but at least don't have him come in every five minutes and make the guests feel out of place. When we ordered our food the server asked what bread we would like. I asked if it was included and didn't tell us how much it was extra. So when I got my bill they not only forgot about taking off the groupons but also pointed out rudely to me (a woman) that the fine print said one per table. I used to be a server and you never are rude to a customer nor do you charge them something without them knowing about it first. So the groupons were never used or given back. So a $20 dinner turned into a $50. WOSRT RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!

WATCH OUT FOR THEM CHARGING YOU WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I love Indian cuisine and this really hit the spot! I ordered the chicken kabobs which were great and the order was huge so I was able to take home leftovers to enjoy later! The pricing was fair and the service was fast! I was surprised more people were not dining there with us!"}
{"text":"We've been to every Indian restaurant in Arizona and this one continues to be the very best.  Started coming here 20 years ago. Current owner opened some years back and it's even better."}
{"text":"A hungry evening, took my gf here for dinner seeing the good reviews. The air did not feel fresh when I stepped in and it was warmer than most restaurants. There were very few ppl on a Wednesday evening. The ambience and the overall feel of the restaurant is not great considering their prices. The tandoori chicken was OK, had too much onion flavor in it. The butter chicken was OK , strong flavors. The check was at $40 for two whichl was not worth."}
{"text":"Best Indian in tempe. 10 dishes on the buffet, all exquisite. Customer service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"SOOOO good! Staff is amazing and very nice and the food was delicious! I will defiantly have to come back here."}
{"text":"I made an impromptu stop at Nandini on my way home from work. I love Indian food, I've eaten it all over our great state of Arizona for years. And by far this was my best experience \"having a random curry.\" The waiter was incredibly gracious, as though he were inviting me into his home for a meal. He was attentive without being overbearing or hovering, always encouraging me to take my time and relax. Genuinely friendly! 

The spice scale is spot on accurate, I take medium and it was medium! Eyes a little watery, sinuses cleared medium! But even through the burn all the spices were alive and flavorful. Mango and mint chutney with papadam start the meal, unlike most Indian joints they didn't offer complete meals and entrees didn't automatically come with rice. Which was nice because the portions are healthy size on their own- my eyes were bigger than my stomach! I'm a sucker for naan and the garlic naan was not only a beautiful piece of food but delicious and light texture- not doughy! I had vegetable soup to start and Aloo Gobi as my main dish. The cauliflower and potato were perfectly cooked, not mushy! So much food! I should have brought a friend! 

I needed a take home box! Which is a problem because I ride a motorcycle. After finding the first box didn't fit in my bag the waiter brought me an array of bowls!! SERVICE. Twenty dollars later (two people could have eaten this meal and been perfectly satisfied.) I am a happy camper with my leftovers and a handful of anise seed. 

I just found my dinner spot! It may not be super posh and fancifully decorated but the service and food make this one to add to your hit list for sure."}
{"text":"Their garlic naans are really good. They have to improve on their biryanis and goat curries."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and friendly service! I typically get the paneer tikka masala, and I'm not disappointed. We frequently get dinner togo from here and they are always very pleasant and spark conversations."}
{"text":"Had buffet there and we were kinda disappointed. The floor was dirty and which was sticky especially where the food was served. Mango larsi was not even cold. The only good thing is free garlic nan. Remember this place is not pure vegetarian. They serve meat and chicken."}
{"text":"So glad we found this wonderful restaurant! The food was fresh, bursting with flavor, and delicious. Great and fast service from the staff. We are adding  Nandini as one of our favorite restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  Sunil was our amazing kind, informative and generous server and soon to be friend:-). He gave us a tour of the amazing lunch buffet served on Saturday/Sunday which left us totally impressed for variety and superb favors!  Numerous lamb, chicken and vegetarian options complete with naan, desserts a variety of complimentary beverages with an additional weekend bonus of a  beer or glass of champagne ..all included for an amazing price of $11.99!  We will most certainly be back:-)"}
{"text":"The food was so good here! I would recommend the butter chicken with butter naan, but any chicken dish here is very delicious. What I tried of the lamb wasn't anything special, it's not worth getting over chicken.

One dish came out before any of the others and our naan bread came out after all the food had been served.

The service was slow, even though it was only my table of four and another small group. It was also a little pricey for what we got.

Overall, the most stand out thing was the butter chicken with butter naan. It was a great combination worth going back for."}
{"text":"Came in August here in Arizona and was missing Indian food badly. Luckily one day my seniors took me to Nandini and guess what the food was heaven. We had their buffet which had almost all famous Indian currys and so many items in desserts. Loved the place."}
{"text":"One of the Best!
Great food, cozy seating....smells wonderful as you walk through the door!
The chicken curry was fab."}
{"text":"This place is our favorite. The food is really good (we have tried others around the valley and we come back here). The mango lassi is perfection! Today we tried goat and it was tender! I can go on."}
{"text":"I normally am not very inclined to provide reviews... but this one stands out. I was debating on whether to give one or two stars.... I once had food at a worse place... but that would have earned no stars at all.

From the Mango Lassi to Paneer Tikka Masala, Chiken Kadai... everything I had wasn't good. I had gone there after looking up 4 stars in yelp from 54 reviews... Well I guess sometimes yelp reviews can be way off the mark.

I have had my dinner more than 5 hrs back... and I am still burping."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here since we moved to the Vally four years ago, and when we came back again last night we were surprised and a little concerned to find it was under new ownership. I've had Indian food all over the country and this was the best I'd ever had, so it's always concerning if anything changes up. However, we were thrilled to discover the food was just as flawless as ever. I don't know how they do it so much better than everybody else, but this place is as good as it gets for Indian. 

I'm honestly a little glad that it's under new ownership because it looks like they've got the business coming in a little better for whatever reason, and every time we went in the past we were always so worried they'd go out of business with how few people were in there. I liked the dim lighting that they used to have a little better than the bright lights they use now, but it's certainly not affecting the food. I do miss that sweet lady that waited tables though. I'm pretty sure she owned the place (with family maybe, i don't know, but she seemed kind of in charge) and she was always very nice. The new guy seems great too, but I hope the old family is still doing well.

We've lived all over the Valley and we still always came here, and that's not changing any time soon. It's possible to find cheaper Indian food, I imagine, but I don't care. This is my favorite restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"Their food was so good! I loved the Chicken Tikka Masala. The owner is so nice as well! Very very full and very very satisfied"}
{"text":"I went on Labor Day so it was quiet and a little slow. The food was was below average in my opinion. I have been to most of the Indian food buffets in the east valley and have a pretty good understanding of the cuisine.  Also, the buffet was a dollar more then advertised on \"their\" website.  Basically, not much attention to detail here, try another place."}
{"text":"Second time here! And again the experience is amazing and the food is awesome ! The people are nice and courteous will come here again ! Thanks again !"}
{"text":"First visit, and we'll be back!  The food is awesome, definitely the best lamb saag I've ever had. Great garlic naan as well."}
{"text":"We tried this joint again. This time it was fantastic. Somasa chat, vegetable briyani was very nice.
Paneer tikka masala was equally good.best was briyani though.gobi paratha and pudina paratha was oki , for me maybe too much ghee/oil. Over all it was nice"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the neighborhood last night (1-14-2016) and was driving past when I noticed Nandini. I really enjoy Indian food, so I decided to stop in and give it a try. Best decision possible!!!

I have lived overseas and have tasted authentic food from many different regions. I must admit, this is the best Indian food I have had in the US! No kidding! I had the Chicken Tikka, spicy (of course ^,^)... Unbelievable! Also, the nan was amazing! 

If you happen to be in the area and are a lover of authentic cuisine, give this place a go! Absolutely worth it! Albeit, a bit pricey by the end. Worth it ^,^"}
{"text":"We will definitely be coming back here! We had chicken tikka, Channa Masala, and lamb vindaloo. All soo wonderfully delicious, and perfect spice level. (Medium) Our server was great too!"}
{"text":"$4.99 for a pile of iceburg lettuce, lemon wedges and a pile of white onions. No, not now, not ever. Avoid"}
{"text":"Delicious food but the place has a roach problem. While eating, I saw a baby roach crawling on the wall next to me. I killed it and continued eating thinking he might have just snuck in. As we were finishing our meal another one crawled onto the table. We paid our bill and decided it would be our first and last visit. Too bad too, they had some really good food."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was amazing today.  Took my daughter and my granddaughter.. The staff is so nice and the food was amazing.

Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Nandini's serves superb Indian cuisine!!! I couldn't eat as much as I usually can because the food was SO EXCELLENT!!!
 I have been there two times this week!!!
 I Love Indian food and This restaurant is particularly good!!!

{"text":"I have been to Nandini's several times now and have genuinely enjoyed every visit. The staff are always welcoming, friendly, and attentive.  We usually go for the lunch buffet, it has consistently been fresh and delicious. The chicken korma and chicken curry are family favorites. We also like to order the onion kulcha - it is excellent. It is a comfortable, casual place to hang out with friends and family for a wonderful plate of Indian food."}
{"text":"Love this place. They are friendly and very nice to our 4 year old! Food is excellent and reasonably priced. Been here several times and always had a great experience. Have taken several friends here and they seemed to enjoy it too."}
{"text":"My husband and I met friends for dinner at Nandini  last night (our second time there) and we were so pleased with our dinners!  Three of us had the Chicken Tikki Masala,  and my husband had the Tandoori Chicken along with Rice, Garlic and Plain Naan and Vegetable Samosas.  The food was divine.  The service was friendly and solid.  The dishes are huge, enough for a \"take home dinner\" for the next day!  We are so happy to have this yummy restaurant in our neighborhood.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time at Nandini, definitely won't be our last! Great food, friendly staff and awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice for the lunch buffet and both times the food has been fantastic. The waiter Ageet is bet attentive and a great waiter. The service is top notch. Will come again and again."}
{"text":"Wonderfully yummy food, large portions, fast and friendly service--what more could you want?

We tried the tandoori chicken and lamb boti kebab, with garlic naan and basmati rice.  You can order your food mild, medium or hot. We went with the medium and it was perfectly spiced: just enough spice to add some heat, but not enough to need constant water.

Service was excellent. Our food came out fast, waters refilled before we realized they were low, and they really cared if we liked the food.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"On our stay in Tempe and having a craving for Indian Food for dinner. Yelp to the rescue again! We tried the Tandoori Chicken which was not only tasty but a healthy portion for two. The curry chicken was also enjoyable. When in the Tempe area again my wife and I would not hesitate in dinning at Nandini for another meal."}
{"text":"Such a great find! Not only was the food amazing but the place was clean and the owner Ajit was fantastic!"}
{"text":"When trying a new restaurant we like order the same thing. We started with
Samosa great flavor and the shell was thin and not doughy. Then we had the 
Alogobi  baggan barta , chicken tikki marshala . All delicious and excellent flavor.
We plan to return . And enjoy some of their tandoori. Friendly and fast
Service. Worth a visit"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant based on Yelp reviews and we were so happy we did. The owner was friendly, the service was fast, and the food was delicious.  The garlic naan was covered with fresh shredded garlic, and the lamb saag was light and flavorful.  I also had the eggplant dish, which was spicy and satisfying.  This place is in a strip mall, but give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food, with enough to share. Went with some first timers & we will definitely be back. Service was fantastic -overall great experience."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars for this restaurant. Food was horrendous, bland and stale. Not a single item on the buffet tasted good. I came out feeling hungry and dissatisfied. I don't usually write reviews, but after eating buffet on a weekday, I thought I should write one and save other people some time. I noticed people who were giving 4 and 5 stars for this place are mostly non Indians. This is not how Indian food tastes, try out some other Indian places in the valley and you will notice the difference."}
{"text":"The best Indian I've had in Phoenix! Such great food. Everything was so flavorful. I had the chicken tikka masala which was delicious. The owner is friendly and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"This was my first Indian food experience and I gotta admit I'm now officially a convert! This food was absolutely amazing - the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Korma, and Lamb Saag were all so good! I wish I had more room in my stomach. Throw in delicious Naan and their specialty coconut Naan really finished the night right. It's a little expensive, but check Groupon they often have great deals on there :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. Excellent service.

Lety me dispel something in the reviews below. The place does not smell of raw sewage. The place smells like a family Indian restaurant, and i like it. A good restaurant smells of the food prepared there.

Also I read that the service was not good. Not true. I was treated especially well. The owner was very nice, have me a free drink as I waited for my takeout order. Also, gave a free order of gulab jamun for desert.

We ordered takeout. We always used to order from pasand a few miles away, which sadly closed a few years ago. This place has a lot on common. Understated and unpretentious, they clearly put all their effort into the food. Palak paneer was fresh cheese and amazingly spiced. The tandoor chicken was redolent with spices and flavor. Prefect samosas and naan. Excellent tikka masala. 

I was sad when pasand closed and hadn't found a replacement it yet...until now."}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever. For years. Used to be Royal Taj, same ownership different name. Don't ask. Just eat. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Nandini in its previous incarnation....but I'm glad other yelpers had, so when they had a groupon offer, I knew this was surely a good place! We came for a late dinner and opted to order fresh, cause ya never know with a buffet...

The decor leaves much to be desired (especially the ladies room) but the service is charming and friendly.

Their heat scale is legit IMO, as a 5/10 was about as much as my mom could handle and she's no wuss."}
{"text":"We were looking for Indian cuisine following our evening at the Botanical Garden. I have not had good Indian cuisine since moving back to the States in 2009 and this restaurant was hands down incredible! Everything was traditional, traditionally made in the clay oven, exquisite flavors in every bite. I highly recommend this place. This will be our go to now for Indian cuisine from here on out. We had the papadums with chutney which I couldn't stop eating. The garlic and buttered naan were absolutely perfect in flavor and texture. We shared the traditional chais, the Chicken Korma, the Chicken Vindaloo and the Basmati  rice and all of it was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. Can't believe we were so lucky to find such an incredibly hospitable and excellent restaurant to include the owners and we hope to pass it on to everyone we know. Do not allow the one or two bad reviews to convince you to miss out on this awesome food and service."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options and the service is good. Always very polite. I've only ate at the buffet but never disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The tandoori chicken was delicious and service was excellent! Best indian food in the valley!"}
{"text":"We went last night as we had purchased a Groupon. A little out the way for us but definitely will be going back. The food was delicious. We had the Lamb Korma and the Mutter paneer with Garlic nan. Sometimes I find lamb to be a bit fatty and tough, but it was delicious. The service was good too, nice and friendly. I really liked the house Chardonnay too."}
{"text":"Nandini Indian Cuisine has a wide variety of authentic Indian food in their buffet that was so delicious I had to get seconds. The staff is on top of it always checking on you to refill you drink or asking if their is anything else you need. I go to the valley once a month and always hit this place up!"}
{"text":"I think this might be the best Indian food I have had in Phoenix. The only reason I am not giving it five stars, is because I ordered a rum and Coke and it was eight dollars. The food was off the hook though. Service was excellent. Highly recommend. When I go back, maybe they will lower their drink prices, and I'll change this to five stars."}
{"text":"I've visited Nandini's lunch buffets for approximately 5 times over the last year. Initially, I was really impressed with the spread and the price (i twas 7.99 a year ago). The mango lassi, was good, although sweet. Their tandoori chicken was delicious, better than most other Indian buffets. They also had lamb curry when it was 7.99.

Now, the price is 9.99, and a lot of things changed. I was expecting the food to get better when they raised the price, but they did not. During my most recent visit, there's no longer lamb, the naan was over-charred, and the tandoori chicken doesn't taste as good anymore.

What happened here? Nandini used to be cheaper and better! Now, it's just decent and priced same as other Indian Buffets. It's still worth a try for yourself, but I will stop frequenting Nandini."}
{"text":"We had a really nice dinner here (using a Groupon). Service was excellent and friendly. The chicken vindaloo wasn't as sour and spicy as I'd hoped but the paneer tikka masala and eggplant dish (bharta) were both excellent. I'd certainly recommend this place for northern Indian."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and tried a few different things. Everything has been excellent. Both vegetarian and meat dishes. Easily some of the best Indian food I've had."}
{"text":"The food is incredible, and the prices are amazing. Kids ate free, and on Saturday we got free champagne with our meal. Under $30 for the 3 of us to eat our fill"}
{"text":"First time here. My husband and I stopped for lunch. Buffet lunch. The food was really good and the staff was nice. Not a huge variety of food. The chicken tikka masala was awesome. The saag was a litter bitter but still very good. The slightly bitter saag is the only reason for the 4 stars and the building was a typical strip mall building. Not dirty but a little worn."}
{"text":"Food is good, plentiful. Good waitstaff. Very plain restaurant, not much ambiance, but the food is fresh and tasty at a low price. Simple menu as well makes ordering much easier than places that have 200 items. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Meh, it's OK. Chicken vindaloo lacked the depth of flavor that makes Indian food so good. The quality of the chicken was lacking as well. Definitely not what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery which arrived super quick! The tandoori chicken was outstanding. So flavorful and probably enough for two to share. My husband ordered the lamb curry which was fantastic. The meat just fell apart, it was so tender. We split a vegetable biryani which had a bit of kick to it, quite pleasant. We also ordered the garlic naan. One was plenty enough to share. Overall, great food and awesome experience. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and authentic. Service was good.....but the food! We will be coming back every time we are on this end of town. I've been looking for a great local Indian restaurant I can call home, and I just found it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian Restaurant! They have the best lunch buffet and it seems to get better and better every time we go. The waiters are all so welcoming and friendly! I cant wait to take my parents to eat there when they are in town. Love love love it!!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago. I was surprice the food was good, amazing naan. Table set up was durty and the cup was durty as if it was not dry. I was kinda throwing off by a comment the one of the guy from there made with the waitress. He kept on talking something about private part and balls? ... as she constantly told him to stop. I can hear them as they where cleaning the table b/w us. He looked like the manager or something, if he was or is the manager I think he should focus more on havibg clean clothes on rather than talking about other stuff... But over all it was good."}
{"text":"Well... this is not in our plan for Saturday lunch. since our planned place is closed we are forced to go here for lunch buffet. All I noticed and experienced is the place is having very less no of options in the buffet .They charge 11.99$ on weekends , yet no much bling on their menu.

We are not satisfied with the food quality as the flavored rice and garlic naan they offered is too bad and it is easily seen that the chef is no where interested working on the weekend :-) . I would not go again and would not even recommend my friends."}
{"text":"First time visit with a wonderful outcome. The place was empty on a Monday night so we were seated quickly and in a friendly manner. Ordered chicken vindaloo, whole wheat naan and chicken biryani. We were served complimentary papadum, cilantro chutney and tamarind sauce. Wish they had been more generous with the cilantro chutney and tamarind sauce.  They were served in tiny ramekins that barely allowed us to dip in the papadum. 
The chicken biryani was delicious and as spicy as we requested. Chicken vindaloo was made without dairy as requested. The sauce had those wonderful Indian spices. The naan was the perfect complement to our dishes and helped to sop off that delicious sauce.  No room for dessert but based on food and service we will be returning real soon."}
{"text":"We visited here for dinner, and while the dinner meat dishes were a bit expensive (the veggie stuff was much more reasonable) the food was really good and the service was very attentive and polite. I need to go check out their lunch buffet one of these days soon as it was recommended to me."}
{"text":"After seeing the Yelp reviews about this place I had to try it!  I'm so glad I did because it was amazing!  We got dinner to go and stopped to pick up a movie.  The car smelled so good on the way home.  Truly, the food was out of this world!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. The flavors and spice levels are fantastic and not watered down. Come here for some great Indian food!"}
{"text":"Tika massala is amazing. Great nans. Not s great atmosphere but hood food. Went there two weeks ago and really enioy their food."}
{"text":"Great food, the reps at the bar (pick up food) have extremely poor customer service skills. Im not sure about the waiters."}
{"text":"The place is pretty bare, minimally decorated, and missing a warm feeling (it was also cold inside). We enjoyed the food here, the service was fine, if a little slow with checking up on us.  My wife ordered her dish mild, but came out spicy. The flavors were good, the portions decent, although not as big as some other places.  We ordered samosas which were tasty but could have been crispier and not so greasy.  I think we would return here again, maybe to get a take-out order."}
{"text":"Poor old style interior . The restaurant looks run down & depressed . Poor selection of paint on the walls , ceiling was badly run down ... Service was poor as well , the guy taking care of tables didn't smile a single time we were there . May be he is not really from food industry and this thing  is new to him . I suggest owner/manager of this place to work on interior & service .. Food was decent , for 6.99 buffet variety of food was good . Veggie biryani wasn't authentic and lacked taste . Garlic naan was just average . Gulab Jamun & kaddi were only 2 items that I felt were great in taste rest were all average and lacked authenticity . This can be a good restaurant only if they work on interior & service . Overall 3.5"}
{"text":"I loveee hot food and can handle a lot of varieties if spicy but their spicy literally burned my throat and intestine as I swallowed each bite. I felt the heat sitting in my stomach after I ate. Beware lol"}
{"text":"Food was good, but super pricey. Also service was SUPER slow. Not coming back because it's expensive. 

Update: got an upset stomach after."}
{"text":"Picked up an order to go.

Early evening, inside was very quiet and clean. The aroma of wonderful Indian food filled the air as I walked in and instantly greeted. Went to the bar to pay, also immediately greeted and the gentleman who helped me was very nice. After paying, the food was promptly brought out to me from the kitchen.

Portions were appropriate and the food was excellent. Food was nicely packed and still very hot after the 10 minute drive home. We ordered the chicken masala, vindaloo and naan. Both entrees were some of the best we've had in the SE valley. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time tonight and LOVED it!  Any time I go to a new Indian place, I get the chicken tikka masala as a 'baseline' dish to compare to other restaurants, and Nandini's was delicious.  Tender chicken in a great sauce and awesome portions.  My boyfriend got the tandouri chicken and it was great as well, again great portions for the price.  I also got their homemade chai tea and it was great, not at all the syrupy stuff you get at Starbucks.  This is real, authentic chai.

The only slight downside is that rice/naan don't come with the meal, you have to order separately, but the portions for these sides are good and it's worth it.  

Wait staff was friendly and attentive.  Dinner took a little long, but was worth the slight wait.  Restaurant is clean and cheery, nice environment.  I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to the majority of Indian restaurants in the Phoenix area.  NANDINI has the best food in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly amazing, The Food was Great and the service awesome..
I will come back for sure!!!! BEST Indian Food in Tempe.."}
{"text":"Good fresh and reasonably flavorful food-but not special. I also don't know what they're doing with the peas pilau- they add onions and tomatoes. I'm used to it being rice saffron and peas. It's almost wet-and that was not pleasant."}
{"text":"Good food, nice customer service. Didn't have biryani on the menu but whatever was there was tasty. The salt in the food may not be enough for some people but it was good enough for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the epitome of Indian cuisine. The atmosphere is inviting, the service is friendly, and the food is exceptional. Everything from their naan to their curries is phenomenal. Easily the best Indian food in the greater Mesa area."}
{"text":"We chose vegetarian options and we're not disappointed.   Excellent meals and service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is superb and my girlfriend and I have made it our regular spot. Simply the best indian food outside of the subcontinent. Popular with the Tempe crowd and the local indian community. Their lunch Buffett is so good i felt guilty for eating so much, but the bill was so cheap! 

Its also the only place that gives you complementary mango lassi and garlic Naan."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 1 star only because of the waiter that served us tonight. The food is really good. When I first arrived, I was told that they charge you for rice with your meal. When I kindly asked the server why they don't increase the price of the meal to include rice, he quickly responded that I should put it on Yelp. Weird. So of course I did. He looked up this review and came back to the table and said, \"thanks for your two star review.\" Which of course he was being sarcastic. I've never really encountered a server who was really inappropriate and out of line as this one was tonight. Nonetheless, the food was good. I won't be back because of him though."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food in the Phoenix area! Incredibly tasty and authentic food, hearty portions, and great service. Prices are also very reasonable. If you are an Indian food lover, definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Our beloved Royal Taj has returned as Nandini! The ownership stayed within the same family so the dishes are blessedly all the same. The interior got a bit of a facelift, and the service is still very warm and friendly.

Get the korma, and you won't be sorry. I have yet to try a place that comes close to their sublime version. They also have the best garlic naan of anywhere I've tried. We are big fans of the saag paneer and their masala dishes. I love the paneer tikka too since it's just grilled cheese on a bed of onions and peppers. It's a nice change of pace from the all the sauce-heavy dishes.

I have only gone for dinner because of my work schedule, but my sister says the buffet is awesome. Fewer choices than other Indian buffets, but the quality of the food is unbeatable."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here but it was really disappointing. Service was not great, they were not very friendly. Food was not good at all. Very bland. I would not reccommend this restautant. Only nice thing was the Naan bread."}
{"text":"Only tried this once.....so far! It was really very good and they delivered! The samosas are delish and the lamb vindaloo was flavorful and spicy. The naan and basmati rice were great also.... I'll be trying it again.... soon"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced with small, liquefied portions. Unexpected greediness with handling of rice, naan, and tea. 

I feel foolish and ashamed for having dined here. 

## REGULAR MENU

$13 for a very small, unimpressive dish of Palak Paneer. 
$2 for a very small boat of basmati rice.
$2 for a single piece of naan (but cut-up, of course). 
$3.25 for child's size cup of Chai Tea. 

Analysis:
----

- Nandini's Paneer is very soupy, and more or less liquid. BAD. 

- There were about 8 1\" Paneer (cheese cubes) immersed in the Palak (blended spinach and herbs). They tasted like they hadn't been cured long enough with the rennet to have any flavor.

- You need rice or naan to eat Palak. And Nandini will gouge you for either, then take away both before you finish them leaving you the impression that you're going to get a refill. But no, the waiter just wants to take your food away before you've finished. 

Conclusion:
---

DO NOT GO HERE. Try Curry Corner or Delhi Palace or anywhere else. 

Pehaps the positive reviews for Nandini come from people who all used a 50% Groupon, but fail to mention that they'd never come back and pay full price.

## FOR THOSE LIKING THEIR BUFFET

I see people raving about their buffet in other reviews. Ridiculous. Try Delhi Palace on Rural and University for $10 and far, far, far better food."}
{"text":"I have been to many Indian Restaurants, this is the best one I've ever been to. So fortunate to have stumbled upon it since the place I was planning to go was closed. Great tasting food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We love Nandini, we have been fans of this restaurant since discovering it about a year or so ago.
They serve generous portions at reasonable prices. 
Management is very friendly, and we would recommend Nandini to anyone asking about a good restaurant, Indian or not."}
{"text":"Very good food! Had the butter chicken and garlic Naan...will be coming  back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Having never had Indian food before, I thought it was pretty good! We had good service, I only wish there had been more to the dishes besides lots of sauce and a few chunks of meat.  I would have loved some veggies with the dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"The food was good. I tried the buffet and everything I tried was good. The only negative was they were out of the fried rice and low on white rice. The place wasn't filthy, but there could be improvements on the restaurants presentation and cleanliness. I like Indian food and I would go back if that helps you make a decision about trying this place. The fresh garlic naan bread is really good!"}
{"text":"All the foods here are great. Try the daily lunch buffet to figure out what you like."}
{"text":"I was contacted by the owners after posting my initial review a few months ago, where I had rated Nandini a much deserved 2 stars.  

The owners asked me to return and even offered me a free meal, which is more than most restaurants will concede these days and was greatly appreciated, but I wanted any future visits to be on my terms, so I cordially declined their free food and promised I would return on a day of my choosing.  

Well, today was that day.  I returned to give Nandini a second chance and took both friends and family with me to gather their opinions, as well.  The consensus?  In some ways, the experience was better than last time.  In other ways, it was largely the same.

Compared to my first visit, the food was somewhat better tonight.  The Paneer was in cubes, rather than the ground up curds we received the first time.  The Makhani, although still seriously lacking in spice and flavor, was far less overbearing on the butter and cream elements, which made it easier to eat and easier on the stomach afterwards.  The Tikka Masala was still only \"ok\", also lacking in spice, but was far better seasoned than the Makhani and one of the better dishes we tried this evening.  

The chicken in the Tikka Masala was cooked well and there was plenty of it to go around.  Additionally, the Naan was made much, much better than before and it wasn't burned.  The Garlic Naan had no hint of Garlic seasoning, but the Paneer Naan and plain Naans were as expected.

The Samosas Chaat tasted great, possibly the best dish we received, but it was far from perfect.  The Samosas themselves were very hard and there was so much sauce on the plate (and so few chickpeas) that it was more like Samosa soup!  Nonetheless, the taste was there and the extra sauce, though a bit unattractive and messy in appearance, tasted great on the extra Naan and rice we had left over.

Service was slightly better this time, as well.  As before, only a few tables came in while we ate and one server was tending to everyone, but the pace was perfectly acceptable and we never felt neglected by our server. Food arrived rather quickly and the atmosphere was much as it was before...plain and casual, but reasonably comfortable.

My conclusion...

Overall, the prices at Nandini are still quite high for the quality of food and while the dishes were generally more palatable then before, they weren't without flaws.  The curries, which were among the most expensive items on the menu, remained very \"one-dimensional\" in flavor compared to most Indian food I have eaten here and in India.

Still, there were enough improvements to the overall experience that I feel I can increase the star rating from 2 to 3 stars, meaning Nandini is \"good\" in my book, but not \"great\" and certainly not \"excellent\".

I appreciate the owners reaching out and expressing their concern after my initial review.  That meant a lot to me and is largely why I gave them a second chance.  As for the likelihood that I will return again...only time will tell.  There are certainly better Indian restaurants around, especially for the price.  However, Nandini is far from the worst.  Perhaps I will return later this year to see if things continue to progress at Nandini.  Until then, I hope the owners will take my words to heart and continue to improve the quality, flavor and overall value of their food."}
{"text":"My wife and I went after getting a $30 for $15. We went to Nandini for dinner. (They do have a lunch buffet that we want to try out soon).

Good: For an appetizer my wife ordered the Chicken Pakoras which were great, rich, flavorful and had two dipping sauces one like a chili pepper paste and the other a sweet tangy sauce. 

For dinner she had the Palak Paneer which was VERY fresh and VERY good with a side of rice. 

I had a serving of Lamb Naan (again very fresh, and very good) and the Spicy Shrimp Vindaloo for dinner. The shrimp were big and cooked perfectly the sauce was great as well. (also had a side of rice). I also had some Mango Lassi which was probably some of the best I've had.

The owner gave us complimentary samples of tea, a crispy bread (can't remember the name) and a delicious desert (deep fried dough balls in syrup). 

Portions are a good size, the menu is well-priced, and very reasonable for the quality of service and food.

We will return with or without a groupon. 

For those of you \"spicy-phobes\" you can order your dish mild, medium, or spicy. As someone who eats spicy foods on a regular basis I can tell you the spicy isn't unbearable, it'll clear out your sinuses and still has a great flavor. 

Bad:

None really, I wish I had more room for food. 

Final thoughts:

It's a great place to eat and I highly recommend going there. Some of the best Indian food I've had since moving here in July of '13.

If I HAD to have a \"complaint\" the only thing I would say is: They don't have any alcoholic beverages, I wouldn't mind seeing a few Indian beers on the menu, as I really do enjoy Indian beer."}
{"text":"Nandini is so delicious! I'd eat here everyday if I could! I often find myself thinking about it during, after work, at home...you get the point. Thank you Nandini for your amazing meals!"}
{"text":"Hands down best indian food I've ever had. The owner is super nice and the food potions are generous and they've never disappointed. I've been here many times and the food is consistent and always delicious! A must visit!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The garlic Naan and the garlic rice was deliciously paired with the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Korma."}
{"text":"This is the first review I have ever taken the time to write, but this place is really amazing.
First off, I was a little late to the party when it comes to Indian Food, but once I tried it, I basically became obsessed.  From that point, I was out trying different Indian restaurants all over the valley.  After trying just under ten restaurants, I landed on Nandini, and I haven't been anywhere else since.
Food is great, and is consistently great - never had a bad meal here.  Service is also great, very friendly, helpful staff."}
{"text":"Just happened to stumble into this place for one of their lunch buffets. There seemed to be a buzz about a new name and menu and the inside looked different than before.

Arrived right when they opened and did a head dive straight for the buffet. They had a nice medium sized selection of items with several options for those who do not eat meat. Really liked the freshly cooked Garlic Naan bread that they brought to the table. It was delicious and a great way to sop up the sauces.

The best part of the buffet is that you can eat as much as you want. I went up a few times and was completely full by plate number three. The Tandoori Chicken was very good and ended up eating an equivalency of a buckets worth at KFC.

Everything else was very tasty and with just the right amount of heat for the common folk. I doctored mine up with some of the spicy peppers and hot sauces to get it that extra kick in the pants.

Service was very pleasant and the place was comfortable and clean. Just make sure that you are watching your feet as you approach and leave the buffet table. The level of the floor changes quickly in one spot and can create a party foul.

Bring the family and the kids. The value of food per square inch makes this a great deal. Plus it is pretty fast to get into and out of in a hurry and back to work. ALL YOU CAN EAT HAPPY!

Would give 0 stars if possible. Service was also sub-par."}

We had the tikki saag and Malai kofta (sp?) And I would recommend it to anyone that wants dishes full of flavor. I just finished my meal and already can't wait to come back again to try more new dishes."}
{"text":"This place may be having an, \"off night.\" The service was good - the appetizer was fantastic! The Vegetable Biryani rice had shavings of carrots and a few peas but lacked vegetables. It was basically seasoned rice with a light sprinkling of vegetable matter. When we first arrived, the white paper place mats had food stains, the silverware was spotted as were our glasses. The server we had, a cool small-built man with a mustache, switched everything up for us. He couldn't have been better. He gets 5 stars!

2 stars for the main dish, dirty table settings and 4 stars for the service and appetizer."}
{"text":"You cant beat a 6.99 buffet lunch with all the mango lassi and chai you want. Staff is very courteous and friendly! Unassuming and casual, a perfect spot for lunch! I came at 11am and everything tastes just made especially the piping hot garlic naan. If you like good, cheap indian food you should definitely come here. Oh, and it's not too spicy either! Always a plus. Don't miss out on the mango lassi, it's more on the sweet side and that's just how I like it, you can fully taste the mango! Not like those sour lassis where you think you're drinking yogurt. Great find in the city, will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Best Indian food I've had in Phoenix. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Happy to educate about the history of their food and culture if you're interested, and truly understand customer service. 

I had the lamb vindaloo (spicy of course), garlic naan, and a Haywards 5000 beer (at the recommendation of the staff).  The vindaloo was perfectly prepared. The lamb was nice and tender and the spices were a perfect combination of spicy and savory. 

The Haywards 5000 is apparently newly imported to the U.S., and is far superior IMHO to Kingfisher or Taj Mahal. I'm glad they recommended it. 

As an added bonus, they brought me a sample of the Jalapeño Fritter. As of right now this is an off-menu item, but I strongly suggested they add it to the menu as it was fantastic. If you like jalapeños and don't see it in the menu, ask for it."}
{"text":"I've had better Indian, but it was only at the Bombay Club in DC.  Had some great Balti's in London too.  

Samosas were delicious.  As noted in other areas, they really work with some spice on some of the dishes, but still have a great balance of flavors.  

Great selection of Naan.  I ordered it in preference to rice and all were very good.  

Wish we lived in the area to try out the lunch buffet.  

I'll be back.  

Oh - they served papadum as an 'amuse-bouche'.  Never had it.  Very nice."}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite restaurant! My mouth was filled with many different tastes. I haven't experienced such amazing cuisine. We had the garlic bread with the spinach lamb. I am going to go back every time to try something new. From the service to the food it gets a 5 star from me."}
{"text":"We were really sad to see Royal Taj close down... like seriously, I almost went in to a depression :(

So when we heard Nandini's was open we were super excited to go try! The restaurant looks brighter and spruced up... and to our delightful surprise the food was even better than before! 

Four a party of 4, we ordered the:
Lamb Korma (Lamb cooked in special house gravy) $13.99  
Chicken Tikka Masala (Boneless chicken pieces grilled in tandoor, cooked in a mild creamy tomato gravy) $11.99 
Palak Paneer (Tender chunks of Indian cottage cheese cooked in a spinach sauce) $8.99 
With:
Garlic Naan (White leavened garlic sprinkled bread baked in clay oven) $2.49
Lamb Naan (White leavened bread stuffed with minced roasted lamb baked in clay oven) $3.99
And Rice

I put $$, because they offer a cheaper lunch buffet $, which we have yet to try... dinner is more in the range of $$.  

At the end they brought over some complimentary Gulab Jamun (Succulent treats from the north made of special dough, fried and served in sugary syrup)! Delicious :)

I would recommend these three entrée items for sure! If you are a vegetarian, the Palak Paneer is a must - SOOOO delicious. It's creamy spinach and the cheese is super fresh tasting, they go great together! But the Lamb Korma has to be the winner - with Chichken Tikka Masala as a close second. 

For something new, we tried the Lamb naan, which was like an Indian version of a quesadilla... with lamb pieces in between their delicious naan bread. Can't wait to try more new items on the menu :) This one was great! 

For any newbies... this place is a must! The new owner seemed very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant decor is so-so, but I haven't found Indian food this good anywhere else in AZ... we're soooooooo happy they're back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with family using the $30 Groupon. It's cozy here with only one waiter, who could easily be the manager or the owner. Ate garlic naan, baingan bharta,  chicken saag, lamb boti/tikka masala, and basmati rice. Very yummy. I would love to try the lunch buffet sometime."}
{"text":"You have to do the Lunch Buffet! So good and very reasonable! The building interior needs some TLC but that doesn't take away from the food or hospitality. The buffet is done fairly mild so that it is not too spicy for most people but is still very flavorful."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner here this evening.  The staff was very personable and fun, and the food was amazing!  I recommend the samosa chaat appetizer if you want something delicious to share before the main course.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and craving Indian food I convinced a group of co-workers to join me at Nandini. We stopped in on a Wed. for lunch and the place was a little slow with only a handful of tables filled - all I can say is lucky us! 

The food on the lunch buffet was plentiful and full of flavor and the personalized service of the staff was impeccable!  They offered suggestions, kept our water brimming and checked on our meal and overall enjoyment throughout!  We had some first-timers with us and everyone was very happy with the food and selection. This is a great place for those who haven't had the opportunity to try a lot of Indian dishes as they do a good job of explaining them on the buffet labels and the staff are wonderful and help you figure out the pairings for the food and sauces/chutneys.  

Overall a wonderful experience and as this is close to the office we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a great Indian restaurant since we moved to Phoenix three years ago and we finally found it.  We enjoyed two mouth-watering dinners, Tandoori Chicken and the Chicken Curry, with a side of garlic naan. Tasty with just the right spicy heat.  Glad the owners call it CUISINE because they are right in every respect. The servings are generous and the left-overs were just as good the following day for lunch.  We plan to go back soon.  Another wonderful family-owned restaurant that deserves a great review. Please consider another place in the Arcadia area of town. We need to have Nandini closer to us to visit weekly."}
{"text":"We were just there. Awesome buffet with a good selection of food. The restaurant is just over a year old so you should check it out. The owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Fraudulent business practices.

Nandini's website clearly states on the home page that the buffet is $8.99 every day. However, we were charged $11.99 per person instead. When I spoke to the manager he said that the price is higher because it includes soft drinks (which we did not even have). There was no menu stating prices, nor was there any mention of an up charge. The bill simply came at a highly inflated price.

This business is not honest and we will not be returning for this fact alone."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Tempe! Reasonable buffet rates, good variety, great service, nice ambience and delicious food!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet here is one of the best dining deals you can get in Tempe. The buffet features a good variety of well-seasoned favorites and is not overly meat oriented as some buffets tend to be - a boon to those who prefer their diet to be mainly plant-based. I especially liked the chicken tikka masala and the dal (lentil), and freshly-prepared garlic naan was excellent for sopping up the tasty sauces. The service is friendly, the lunch buffet was inexpensive especially considering the quality of the food, and wifi is available."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great service! Always a pleasure to eat here.... my wife and I come here quite frequently even though it's about 15 miles from our house. My usual is extra spicy Tikka Massala, with garlic naan, rice, and a mango lassie.... yumm.
My wife loves the Palak Paneer with rice and naan. We both highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was wonderful. We walked in and we were greeted right away. I recommend the curry chicken, good kick of spice if you like it!"}
{"text":"My goodness this place was good. GOOD! The food was way better than I thought for a small restaurant in a strip mall. Authentic Indian food, every bite delicious. You can order spiciness to your liking, wide enough range of items so you have a good selection without being overwhelmed, and there are both traditional foods and foods that someone unfamiliar with this cuisine can recognize and enjoy. You order family style (large plate to be shared) z we didn't know that and ordered the Tandoor Ginger Chicken kabobs, goat curry, vegetable biryani and the lamb naan....and now have leftovers for another 2-3 meals! But every bite had exquisite flavor so I don't mind at all. HIGHLY recommend and can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find and the food is wonderful with large portions. We eat here a couple times a month. The chicken Tikka Masala is great. It's very plain inside but the food is worth driving to. The manager is also a great guy and we always enjoy seeing him. It is better than any Indian restaurant around and i think we've tried them all."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were so happy to find a indian restaurant much closer to where we live. We usually had to travel all the way to Chandler so it's sort of rare. But now we can go to Nandini! The owner is very friendly and sociable. He made sure we had the best service. You have to try the palak paneer with naan, best combination ever! I can't wait we're going tonight but this time bringing our friend to enjoy this delicious food with us :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place and have been returning fairly regularly, especially for the well-priced lunch buffet. I've had difficulties in the past with locating an Indian restaurant that I liked in the area, and even though many others are closer, this has become the one for me.

The buffet selection is smaller than some other places, but I prefer quality over quantity anyway. Most dishes are there every day, while a couple seem to rotate in and out. Including free unlimited garlic naan and mango lassi with the buffet is a nice touch and something other places don't offer.

The service here has been good as well, which is important considering service has been a struggle at many Indian places I've visited in the past. Waiters fill your water and check on you frequently.

My one minor ding would be that the tikka masala could use a little more flavor, at least for me, and a couple dishes could stand to be spicier. I believe when you order off the menu here, you specify how spicy you want the dish, so it's very possible they make buffet dishes a little blander to cater to all audiences. Admittedly, I like my food spicier than the average person.

Still, it's overall a clean, tasty place that I try to eat at once or twice a month. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"GROUPON led me here and I'm very glad it did. The food alone deserves 5 stars, though the waiting time for my food was long (45 minutes) but well worth the wait! Their entrees are what I'd consider to be average pricing  ($13- $15) a plate.

The server was extremely nice, constantly refilling my glass of water and served my group and I with a smile."}
{"text":"Waiter says \"Nice to see you again\" We tell him it's the first time we've ever been there. AND he argues with us that we have been there before. We tell him \"No, this is the first time\". And again he says more forcefully that we have been there. Are you kidding me? I think I know where I've been. Jerk.
 Food was bland. Nothing special on the menu.  Later in the meal he offers more rice and bread. We figure it's more to go with the meal. But no, it ends up on the bill. It's just rice and bread. And to top it all off, he pushes me to pay cash. WTF? A must to avoid.  So many better Indian joints around."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Garlic naan and especially the vegetable korma was delicious. Would love to come back sometime :)"}
{"text":"As we pulled up in the parking lot I was skeptical about whether or not I would be the 44th five star review for this restaurant. But the food was delicious, the service was friendly, and we rolled out of there with really full bellies. The naan was spectacular, the tamarind sauce and mint chutney were perfect, I loved the palak paneer, and the tandoori chicken. The owner said they've only been open for two months and my guess is they will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"What a great find....
Dinner was excellent chicken Tika and Vindaloo...
Will Def be back to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"1. Ordered aloo tiki, chiceken biryani , tandoori roti and chicken kadai.

Aloo tiki - tasted bad  - it had a layer of uncooked besan ( or something similar to besan)
Chicken biryani - rice was half cooked.
Chicken kadai - chicken does not seem to be fresh.. 

Tandoori roti was good.

2. Asked for check .. the total was $30.25
when i submitted my  groupon coupon.. immediately added $2.25 tax to the check :)

Overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Very clean and spacious restaurant. You walk in and it smells so good! Nandini has THE ONLY buffet I will eat at. Normally I don't like buffets but over lunch, their buffet is a fave of mine. It's inexpensive ($7.95 I believe at the time of this review) and has great food and most of my favorite Indian dishes, plus it comes with naan delivered to your table.  The location is convenient- just a mile or so off the 101 at Broadway. The owner has been there every time we've gone and he's extremely friendly and talkative. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious! Very kind staff, yummy food, just enough spice. Moderate pricing. I ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala in a 7/10 spice and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Omg great good food.. and excellent service and nice people..We went when they had buffet syle which I normally dont do!! but this was top notch.. Cannot wait to come for dinner.. Manager was very nice and gave of tips what to try next time.. Will definitely come back again. And there bread.. OMG.( best)  I could not stop eating.."}
{"text":"We went around 6pm and were the only ones in the restaurant. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. He was helpful ordering from the menu. 
The food was super yummy. It wasn't as spicy as I usually like, but flavor wise it was fabulous. It was reasonably priced for the amount of food we got. I will definitely go back and check out the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This is THE...BEST Indian restaurant in the valley. Food is amazing! We always get the veggie samosas, aloo mutter and chicken tikka masala. Delicious! Service is delightful with friendly staff. If you dine here, you will not be disappointed and will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Definately very good.  Tandori chicken was excellent.  Maganatawny soup was fabulous.  Chicken curry was very good and so was the shrimp marsala."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. Recently renovated, but the delicious food remains. The staff is friendly, service is fast but I never feel rushed. I highly recommend stopping by to check out the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Nandini for the lunch buffet. This place was delicious and had great veggie options. The garlic naan is to die for (truly amazing, my rating is as high as it is because of the naan). The owner was very nice, constantly checking in on us (that could be both a pro or a con, depending on what you like) and clearing plates the second we finished our food. 

However, my boyfriend had severe stomach issues following our experience there. As I've noticed is the issue with many Indian places, there really was a lack of labeling. That makes it hard for anyone with dietary restrictions, or someone that isn't familiar with Indian cuisine, to try all the delicious food. It was also rather empty, which got a little uncomfortable at some points.

I will be back to try the dinner and will update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Update because I received such a thoughtful reply from the owner. Maybe it was simply a bad night. I'd definitely give this place another try -- especially to dine in rather than take out. Nice customer service, Satnam!"}
{"text":"Great Indian Food here. I have eaten here several times now (always the buffet), and it is great! What sets this apart is the quality and selection. There are many different dishes, veg, and non veg. They have several things that I have not seen before at a buffet, including several different types of sweets. I have always received very good service. This is not a fancy place,  but the price is right. I really like that they are not afraid to have some spicy dishes. Most other places in town are very boring in that there is very little spice. Here, at least you have a choice. I would recommend this place to anyone who really wants great food at a great price."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. Great pricing and big portions. Service was a little slow but all around a great place to have a dinner. The ticket time was 12 minutes so the kitchen was very quick , always a plus!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and great service!  We went for dinner on Friday evening, and really enjoyed it.  The staff was friendly and attentive, without being bothersome.  And the food was delicious from start to finish.  The spicing was the right level of heat without being unbearable for us.  The meat was tender and not grisly.  And the sauces were phenomenal.  We will definitely be going back to try their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. The ambiance was a little lackluster but I would prefer great food over ambiance any day. We had a friends birthday dinner here and everything we ordered was cooked and seasoned very well. Food arrived quickly and we were checked in on frequently. I would come back again and recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First time I have eaten Indian food. Must say that it was very good. I had the lamb in a spicy red sauce with some rice. Boy am I full."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the service or the food. I ordered the boat dish, which over 50% of it was nine and fat. The place just opened for dinner and the bathroom was dirty. Me and my wife will not return."}
{"text":"Nandini is insanely amazing. Before this restaurant I had not yet tasted Indian food that was truly above and beyond anything else. It is evident in the food that they go to great lengths to cook truly delicious food. You may have to wait a little bit but it is incredibly worth it."}
{"text":"Who gives 4 stars. Very awful and poor set up. Buffet section set up next to toilet Ewww"}
{"text":"Best we have found in the valley.  We have tried about 4 Indian houses in the area and this has been the best we have found.  Order spicy if you are brave.  It's not crazy spicy but will definitely hit you a bit.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nandini Indian Cuisine is an Indian restaurant with a page of vegetarian options in Tempe. I visited with two colleagues and found the restaurant completely empty at 6:15 PM. We suddenly had fears that all the positive reviews had been about their lunch buffet, and that their dinner was going to be a disaster.

That kind of panic was probably premature.

I ordered the dal makhani and the malai kofta. The black lentils exceeded my expectation. I would order them again. They reminded me of the first time I ever had Indian food: the spices surprised me a bit. The malai kofta was okay. The sauce was uncomfortably chunky, and each vegetable dumpling was a bit dry on the inside. I generally enjoy malai kofta, but I don't think I would order it again here. However, my colleague really enjoyed the texture of the sauce.

The service was fine, but it was a bit awkward that the restaurant was completely empty. The staff waited, watching us eat, from only 15 feet away.

If I return, I'll definitely try some of the other items on the menu. I'd also come back for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"We were there last week and both the service and the food were fantastic.  We had the butter naan, Lamb Vindaloo and Aloo Mutter.  All of the dishes were very flavorful, lots of yummy ingredients but still enough sauce for the basmati rice.  We would highly recommend---they are new to the location and eager for business.  Service was excellent, but once word gets out how good they are they will get busier!"}
{"text":"Stopped and had the buffet for lunch today.  In all the years I have been going to Indian restaurants, I have only had one dish.  Chicken Tikka Masala.  I was going to get takeout but looked at the buffet, and there it was.  (choir of angels sing... \"ahhhhhh\")  

Whaaaat?!  All I can eat chicken tikka masala AND garlic naan.  The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the chicken was juicy, the sauce was a little watery but had all the right flavors, and the naan was amazing!  It was so good, they should call this place Naan-dini.  It was soft and crispy, perfectly seasoned and cooked just right.  I wish it wasn't so good, because I ate 2 baskets of it and now I have to go back to work and try not to fall asleep at my desk."}
{"text":"A few of us tried Nandini today for the first time and our experience was... just ok. We have been really spoiled by eating at the Taj Mahal in Prescott which is absolutely amazing and I think this has clouded our judgement with other Indian restaurants. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Masala, Vegetable Samosas & Garlic Naan.  The Naan and Samosas were actually pretty good, while the Masalas were so-so and lacking in the robust flavor we're used to. Their rice is was sticky... almost mushy. 

The service was slower and the atmosphere could use some cleaning and sprucing up... but their prices were a bit cheaper than other places we've tried. The one thing we noticed was how awkwardly quiet it was which left us feeling like we shouldn't talk either.  Not terrible but overall just... meh. I don't think we'll be back.

UPDATE 2/18/15
The owner contacted me right away and apologized for the experience and offered a meal on the house. Kudos for excellent customer service, thank you Nandini for the offer, we may try it again after all."}
{"text":"YUM!  The best Indian food I have ever had.  So good.  Came here for dinner with a groupon.  Tried the paneer tikka masala and like it so much that I bought another groupon (my friend had bought the first one) and went with my husband for dinner THE VERY NEXT NIGHT!  He also very much enjoyed his meal.  This time the spice level was a bit higher on my dish (I am a bit of a wimp) so I commented to the waiter and he took the dish - partially eaten - and remade it!  Brought me a new full, less spicy dish.  That is very good customer service.

Was excited to try the $6.99 lunch buffet.  Small kids are $4.99 or $3.99, I forget.  Brought my three children and they all really enjoyed the mango lassi, garlic nan, rice, potato dish, dessert, etc.  The food was a bit spicier than our pallets enjoy so will likely stick to dinner where we can order the level of spice we prefer.

I recommended this place to friends who bought a groupon and also really enjoyed their dinner."}
{"text":"This place is hard because i wanna give it a 4 but the food and service is a 5. First time at this place, my other half and i went for the lunch buffet. I was so excited for it but the mister doesnt like the concept of buffets. The food was outstanding, fresh and amazing with just enough variety.And for 2 with a great tip we, didnt spend over $20 and the other half was content. Last night, i was a bit peckish and need some spicy food. I went an ordered some garlic naan and chicken tikka masala with rice. $19 without tip for one. I was blown-away but the bag was heavy and the aromas coming from it, i Still cant remove from my car. When Arriving home and looking at my order. 2 cups of rice, 1 1/2 cup of masala, 1 10in piece of naan. I was shocked due to the portions that lunch has to offer at a cheap price. Really the food is outstanding with lots of flavor and moist protein but the price had me and my other half baffled."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from Nandini tonight and it was delicious. While my family chose to eat burgers from elsewhere, I was in indian food heaven with chicken pakoras, palak paneer, chana masala, basmati rice and butter naan. My kids did chow down on the chicken pakoras though and really liked them. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow so I can have the leftovers. My food was hot and ready on time and the person who helped me (I'm assuming the owner) was very friendly."}
{"text":"Updating my review based on owner's rigid, arrogant ,unacceptable attitude and inflexibility to improve based on customer feedback-

If there was an option of giving ZERO STARS.. i would promptly do so..! Highly disappointed with the quality of indian food served here.
First of all THIS IS NOT INDIAN FOOD GUYS .. BLAND,TASTELESS without any indian aroma whatsoever. I wonder how is this place even 4 stars..REALLY??
Stopped by this restaurant during a recent visit to AZ and i must say being an indian i wouldn't recommend this place at all for all who seek for good aromatic authentic indian food.
First impression - THE PLACE SMELLS BAD.
Second - biriyani is not cooked blandly in a rice cooker & left out on a buffet :)
third - BAD & ARROGANT CUSTOMER. BEWARE!!! 
fourth - hate the food .. how can food be so BLAND & TASTELESS
fifth - you guys are representing indian food here in states, do not give an wrong impression by justifying people like mild food. People appreciate good authentic food not hybrid ( TASTELESS ) one.
Waste of money.. never would return to this place."}
{"text":"Nandini is a very good restaurant, they offered a variety for vegetarian dishes and the servers were very nice. We carry-out often, but we dined in on a week day once. It was quiet, with only two other families there, but it was nice. Staff was very attentive and conversational and suggested dishes and different kinds of beer. The food was amazing as always, their spices are on point and everything was warm and cooked well. We come from Phoenix to this restaurant, foregoing a handful of other Indian restaurants because this one made a great impression on us. We are only able to indulge once a month because of the prices, but that's ok because we have never been disappointed with our orders when we do indulge."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always looking for a good Indian buffet and we def found one! Fresh, delicious, and a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I was sad to see Royal Taj close down. However I stopped in tonight to try out the new restaurant. They guy said he bought the restaurant with his brother and it was under new ownership. The food was even better then before! Which I thought was impossible. Got my go-to dish: chicken tikki masala. Delicious. The owners are super friendly!!!! Will be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. Had a selection of 9 main dishes (more vegetarian than meat), 3 desserts, and chai + mango lassi for drinks. My favorite things were the pakoras, fresh garlic naan, and kheer/rice pudding. The rice pudding was the best I've ever had, just the right sweetness and wonderful flavor, I wish I could know how it was made. 

The server promptly removed dishes and refilled my water glass, and all the workers were polite."}
{"text":"Excellent, I was craving curry chicken. This place was so delicious,  we also ordered chicken tandoori, plain and garlic Naan they gave us an extra garlic Naan. It was exactly what I had been craving for. Delivery was faster than predicted. Nom Nom Nom."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff.  This is my go-to Indian food in the Valley, aside from Little India.  It's a no-frills kind of a place--go for great food.

(I've had a lot of Indian food throughout the US, overseas, and in India)"}
{"text":"My family and I were in Tempe area and looking for a place to eat. As with everything, I like to research recommendations through Yelp. Nandini Indian Cuisine is highly rated so we decided to give it a try. 

The Sunday champagne buffet brunch was very reasonably priced. We thoroughly enjoyed the flavorful varieties of dishes. The curries, naan bread, and samosas were delicious and perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are craving great Indian food and attentive service. My family and I will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Went there with a few work colleagues and we enjoyed our meal immensely.  Service was swift and very professional.  The restaurant was very clean and cool. The food was excellent. Absolutely full of flavour with generous proportions. And the price was also favourable. I like Indian food and would recommend anyone looking for Indian food to go there."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food! The best we have ever eaten. All of our dishes were fantastic. It is impossible to choose which dish we like best, they were all so good!"}
{"text":"I came here for an early lunch with a friend, and boy was I surprised. Fellow Yelpers, you did me well. They have a lunch buffet that lasts until 2:30, and they even offered us champagne or mimosas included in the buffet price. A little early for alcohol, I declined; though a very nice touch. 

Their lunch buffet is very thorough for Indian cuisine. Although I'm not the Indian food expert, I know they had dishes like tandoori chicken, samosas, a few different curries, lamb and plenty of other options including fresh fruit and if I can remember correctly a salad. They also have spiced rice available and garlic naan that is served hot to your table. Make sure to ask for the naan though, as it is made to order versus being out at the buffet. 

My favorite of their items was one of the yellow curries, the samosas, and the spiced rice. Their tandoori chicken was also really good, but I feel like I've had better at similar mom and pop Indian restaurants. 

The service was stellar. You could tell that the gentleman serving us really did care about the/his business. And that's what really goes far in the restaurant industry. I will most definitely return for unlimited Indian food at around $11 or so a plate."}
{"text":"Great food, great service... Family style Indian food that is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Indian restaurants in the valley and this one is my absolute favorite! Delicious fresh food and they recently added goat curry, which is amazing!! Plus on the weekends they give free champagne to accompany! Definitely deserves a nap afterwards LoL"}
{"text":"I live in Phoenix and don't make it to Tempe often, so this was my first time visiting Nandini with my girlfriend. The place was pretty empty when we arrived but a few more couples stopped in while we were there. We went with Saag chicken and tikka masala chicken, and some garlic naan as well. Every part of our meal exceeded our expectations. Each item in our meal was packed with flavor and cooked perfectly. The owner suggested we go with medium spice which was a great choice, not too spicy at all. They even gave us a complimentary order of gulab jamun for dessert! We went for dinner, but how can you beat a $6.99 lunch buffet? Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. 

A very nice owner and good service, but the food was pricey and out classed by other near by Indian restaurants"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet deal! Delicious food and great service. Same owner as India Oven so it's sure to please! Nice decor and comfy booths too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Though I've gone back for the Lamb Boti Tikka Masala 2x now, I ALSO have enjoyed the other dishes I've tried, like the Bhindi Masala (that's another one I'll have to repeat) and the Dal Tadka. The garlic naan and mango lassi were good, too. I've always ordered takeout, so I can't comment on the wait staff, but the manager has always been very prompt, personable, and friendly when I've come in. The dining area is clean, and there's a buffet and a full bar for those who like that kind of thing in an Indian restaurant. I just keep going back because the people are nice and down to earth, and the food is Yum. And if you say you want it spicy, they will make it so."}
{"text":"This place is MAGNIFICENT!!! The food is very fresh and brought to you piping hot like your mom just made it for you and served it to you right off the stove. It is fresh and taste so yummy! If you really enjoy Indian food, this is as good as it gets. I had the Butter Chicken and my husband the Saag Paneer with Shrimps and man oh man!!! We were not disappointed! Also had the delicious mango lassi and naan bread and even the crispy bread with chutney and green spicy condiments was awesome to start you off. I love this food! The waiter was also very kind and attentive to us."}
{"text":"Must try the goat, chicken pakora and chicken naan! The chicken sagg was the best!! Great service and clean place! Coming back to try their buffet soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here for dinner last week as we were craving some Indian food. Being born and raised in India, we both have a fairly good understanding of how authentic Indian food should taste. The food here has authentic flavors and reminded us of home. We ordered the Paneer tikka masala and the Veggie Korma and they both had unique sauces and good portions. I have seen that some other Indian restaurants call it Korma but use the same sauce as the Tikka Masala. That wasn't the case here. The garlic naan and the samosas were fresh and hot as per our liking. The restaurant was not very busy when we went but we still had to wait a considerable time for our food. The wait was worth it though. 

Our only gripe is that, we had a coupon for this place from the entertainment book (2016) which was not honored. I was bummed about that as we have paid for this book and expected to use the coupon."}
{"text":"A very tasty lunch buffet with good vegetarian options and it's not too spicy. They served me some of the lightest and freshest naan I've ever had."}
{"text":"The most delicious Indian food I have ever had!!! Lovely server who was interacting with our baby the entire evening"}
{"text":"We ordered off the menu around 5pm. Chai tea was awful. Food was ok. Hot for medium. Service sucked no plates cleaned off the table. Samosa were good but picture shows four and only two come out on an order. Maybe the buffet is a better experience."}
{"text":"Sunday champagne brunch was delicious! Food was great, large selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes, two different servings of rice, and a big serving of garlic naan, yumm! Enjoy your next meal here with your friends and family!"}
{"text":"***update** the owner is so arrogant and follows up with inappropriate comments when given bad reviews. Not sure what needs to be told to these people to give them a sense of customer review

-----------------------

This place is soooo bland, I cannot imagine this is a 4 starrer. Please don't go by reviews there is absolutely no dish that was even close to be even average.

We tried the lunch buffet and it was so bad we couldn't even take another bite. They charged FULL amount for food we didn't eat.

... And just to clarify you need not make food spicy hot for it to taste good."}
{"text":"Let's just say the best thing I ate when I went here was the free crispy flat bread or whatever it was they serve you before you get your food. I love Indian food and this place is entirely overrated. The only reason why I came here was because of the Yelp rating being so high. I got the goat curry and garlic naan. My friend got the chicken tikka masala, after one bite of her dish, it was undesired for seconds.

My goat curry wasn't served warm enough and was not tender at all. The flavor was bland and not appealing. My garlic naan was burnt and did not taste good at all. The service was below mediocre, I had to ask for water before getting a refill. We were checked up on once the entire duration while we dined there. I don't ever plan on going back. Save your time and money! They even charge you for rice even when their entrees are priced $13.99 for the chicken tikka masala & $14.99 for the goat curry. I wasted $20+ for a sour stomach and bad taste in my mouth. Let's be real here, if you think this place deserves the 4 stars it has on Yelp, you've probably never had good Indian food before. In summation, bad service + bad tasting food = 1 star."}
{"text":"It is very good restaurant, casual dining with right food. The Garlic Naan is yum yum. I and my friend went for Lunch Buffet.The bill for 2 was 15.20 and we tipped 3 dollars for good service. Ajit J who welcomes you, is very nice and kind and very courteous.

{"text":"Just moved to the area so it was our first time at the restaurant. We ordered the Chicken Marsala and asked for recommendations. They were spot on. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area or if you want something delicious."}
{"text":"very good. 
I ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken Tandoori, Nan and parati bread, and Somosa. All were delicious. 
Price is convenient and the service is good.

I will visit it in the future."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Saag. Best Ginger Chicken. Naan is delicious. Great service. Have to come back for the buffet!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from here through PostMates .. My food was made and delivered in a timely manner but my food was very salty and an extremely small dinner portion for the price."}
{"text":"This is my favorite all time Indian Cuisine Restaurant I go to and in fact one of my top favorite food places in general. I always go for the lunch buffet and have been going here for 2+ years now.  The variety is very good and sometimes they switch it up but for the most part the food items are pretty consistent. The food is amazing and top notch quality!  The food is always on point and consistent with the quality. I have brought so many of my friend over the last 2 years and every single one of them fell in love as I did and they have started to bring more of their friends as well.  I have had many other Indian Buffets before but non of them compare to this place.  When I first started coming the prices were very good and I really liked it but recently the price has gone up (Especially on weekend they often have specials now with champagne and it is much more expensive than the week days) Even with the price increase this place is too good not to come and I still try to go often even though I moved a little bit further away.

Oh and the mango smoothie is included with lunch buffet and is delicious and unlimited garlic nun is dangerous because it is so addicting and good!

Our main server is very friendly always welcomes me back warmly and usually recognizes most of the friends I have brought in over the years since they have all become repeat customers.  I'll sure be going soon after I write this review and I suggest you go and find out what you have been missing out on ASAP."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in AZ. Chicken Saag and the Butter Chicken was great, also their naan was beautiful. We love Indian food but haven't had much luck since moving from Utah. We decided to check this place out after seeing such good reviews on Yelp, and it didn't disappoint. The food will no doubt bring us back, but it must be said that the food was pricey ($13 without rice! Who doesn't include rice with their curry dishes?) and the atmosphere was sub par (could have used some Bollywood in the back ground ;) )  Perhaps we will order delivery next time. 

Food: 9/10 (Chicken Saag , butter chicken, and naan!) 
Service: 7/10 (attentive but not personal) 
Atmosphere: 4/10 (turn the music up.. Add decor) 
Price: 5/10 (make sure to use a Groupon)"}
{"text":"My grandma lives in town and we wanted to take her to dinner...man this place was delicious!! The service was great. Next time we're in town were definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Establishment was clean and the food tasted great. Everything is a la cart so expect to pay a little bit more than usual. Each main dish is approximately $13.00 and the portion sizes were smaller than I had expected. We ordered the butter chicken, curry potatoes and cauliflower, garlic naan and regular basmati rice. Everything tasted very good, just enough spice and heat. My friend that was with me just came back from India and he loved the food. Bill total was $30.00! The server did tell us that they have a daily buffet. We are definitely coming back to check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Attentive service :) The house Korma gravy was dreamy and the vindaloo packed the perfect kick. The naan was pillowy soft and perfectly spiced. 
The owners were friendly, and when my engineer boyfriend expressed an interest in the pictures of architecture on the walls, they were glad to discuss it with him :) We can't wait to come back and try the buffet!"}
{"text":"Best indian good I have ever had! I got medium spicy and I was sweating, yet I could still taste the amazing flavors. The lamb was tender and tasty. They offered multiple complimentary items, all of which were delicious. The staff was friendly and the building was clean. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and will most definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place in incredible; best Indian food in town. The samosas are terrific, and the garlic naan is perfect. I usually order the chicken tikka masala, and it has never let me down. The food is a little pricey, but certainly worth it. The staff is very attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet. The service and ambience was excellent, but the food was average. Maybe I went on a bad day? Idk. Some dishes were excellent, especially the desserts, but the chicken dishes were nothing special. The naan bread was hard and dry too. Might go back again to give it another try."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. EXCELLENT.

They have a ton of delicious stuff that I have never had/heard of, but expect tons of veggies, chicken, potatoes, and curry. 

The lunch buffet (yes, a GREAT Indian buffet), was under $10!!!!! ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!

Seriously though, if you want some awesome Indian food here in Tempe, this is the place to go. 

Check it out."}
{"text":"FANtastic! This review is for take out. I ordered Aloo Gobi (with a slight modification that they were HAPPY to accommodate)). They allowed me to order at the bar and I asked if I could wait in my car and they said \"absolutely\" and offered to take it out to me. They brought it out within minutes! When I got home I was happy to see that the portions were large and the food was piping hot! The rice was yummy and fluffy! The garlic nann was great! Aloo Gobi was superb! I was VERY happy with the food and the entire experience."}
{"text":"Best Indian Buffet in town by far!  Especially when you consider cost.  It's 6.99 for a full lunch buffet!

I have gone to quite a few of them but this one is the best.  The service was fantastic and the food was fresh and delicious.  From the Mango Lasse to the Unlimited Naan to the Biryani and Tikka Masala, my friends and I ate to our hearts' content.  Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I've been coming here for years. The servers are very polite and attentive. My favorite is the Tandoori shrimp so much flavor in one bite! The lam curry is also to die for!!"}
{"text":"Good foods, full of flavor, fair prices 3,75 stars

So prices are fair expect $10-$15 a person for plenty of food to fill a full sized man! 

Good spices are used to give you good flavors.

I ordered the Tandoori Chicken and also the garlic rice and garlic bread with a side order of gulag. Everything was really good. 

The service started off super attentive. My glass would reach half full and it would be filled again before I noticed. By the time we were winding down the service disappeared unless we waved, called and made efforts to squire attention.  

All in all good food means come here..."}
{"text":"The man that served me was very nice. The rice had lots of flavor.

There is a daily lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Groupon, what an excellent find! The mint and tamarind sauces were the best I've tasted, tangy and spicy. The chicken vindaloo was perfectly spiced, as was the chicken tiki marsala. The rice was tender, the garlic Naan excellent! Portions were good for the price. The restaurant is clean, and the service was attentive. Not a single thing to complain about here."}
{"text":"Exceptional Indian food.  My food was very spicy--just how I like it!  
Lots of vegetarian options which is so necessary when eating Indian food.  

You have to pay for your rice which I thought was unusual at a restaurant like this and we did need an order for each entree we purchased.  


Perfect vegetable Samosas! Yummy chana masala!"}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner. Food was great. Got lamb tiki marsala and veg korma. Both were outstanding! Garlic nan was also quite tasty. They have a champagne brunch, which we will be visiting one of these weekends. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Why isn't it packed? It is authentic and has great flavor. Clearly they use quality spices and make everything from scratch. I love Indian food and this is the only new place I have tried recently that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very good buffet! Excellent sampling of both of both meat and vegetarian dishes. Complementary soda and glass of champagne was a nice surprise. Agit made sure we had en enjoyable experience and seemed to really take pride in his restaurant. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were traveling thru town and wanted Indian food. We definitely were not disappointed. The butter chicken, tika masala and chicken tika were very tasty. We had an ample amount of food with great naan. The service was very friendly and attentive. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nandini has the best Indian food around!! I've been to many other places and they just do not compare to Nandini. The mango lassi is the best I have ever had. It's sweet and creamy and the mango always tastes so fresh and clean. They have a ton of veggie options, which is great. Paneer tikka masala with some garlic naan? Perfect."}
{"text":"I live close to this place and have driven by on many occassion thinking I should try this. Wow, how absolutely blown away by the food ! It was phenominal we shared the lamb tikki masala vegetable dish and samosa chaata for appetizer. It was so delicious a flavor that was unmatched in Phoenix. The spice we had was medium which came upon you very subtle and sweetly. Can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"Glad it was a Groupon. The great reviews I read must be from people who don't know good Indian food. Perhaps the owners assume their customers will be the same. I do know good Indian food--and this isn't it. First, to have a Palak Paneer main dish (dinner) for $12--and the rice costs extra? You get a side dish serving with nothing else? NOT good. The dish itself was simply vapid spinach mush with three, count 'em, three cubes of paneer. The garlic naan (extra, of course) was very thin-crust pizza with a whiff of garlic and a parsley sprinkle.  NOT naan, but the thinness of pappadum. Service and ambience fine, but as for the food? Not going back. Only one other couple in the place.   So disappointing.  Friend was equally disheartened with her shrimp curry."}
{"text":"I drive by this place almost everyday and have always wanted to stop. I finally did and was not disappointed. Great food and the service was excellent. Try the lamb korma - delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good food. The naan, the rice, and especially the chicken tatikki Marsala, everything was great. Polite and quick service."}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever! I never thought I'd like Indian food, but when I ate here I fell in love. Everything is so tasty and flavorful. Definitely try it out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was here for a lunch buffet. The spread is good, good variety in curries and desserts. The food is pretty good, but can be a touch better, being an Indian I guess I have higher expectations. But, I would go back. Very reasonable. 
One negative comment, a particular person who served us was pretty unhygienic, shabby and awkward. This is not a comment on the hygiene of the restaurant though. Staff was generally courteous. 
Best dishes: Mango Lassi, Garlic Naan, Paneer Tikka Masala, Karee Pakoda !! 
The Carrot Halwa, had a weird unpleasant taste."}
{"text":"Wow, I just found this place here on yelp and decided to check it out. Love it! The food was amazing and mango lassie is included with the buffet. I will definitely be coming back here and bringing my friends. YUM!"}
{"text":"Just as good as it's always been!  Started with the vegetable samosas.  Perfectly prepared, crispy on the outside, soft, warm, and tasty on the inside. Then the Lamb Tikka Masala, the Chicken Korma, and of course the Garlic Naan!

The sauces of each dish were perfectly spiced and the perfect size for two to share. So good, you can't stop eating  

Oh, and the Naan.  Oh the Naan!!  The perfect compliment to a fine time. 

Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Lonely, shabby, carefree to careless waiters roaming around not bothering to check with customers. Mango custard seemed artificially colored. Chicken tandoori was pathetic and seemed re-heated. Vegetable cuts were huge and uneven, not a single touch of Indian culinary ecstasy was shown in the food."}
{"text":"First off, Have you ever been kicked out of a restaurant while you were eating because they were closing?  Normally I get hints but never asked to just leave the place before I'm done eating.  Anyways, the food is so so, not incredible as far as Indian Cuisine goes.  The service was terrible, the waiter/host was unfriendly, slow, and definitely hates working there or hates his job.  The walls, tables, plates, dinner linens were filthy.  I saw roaches in the restroom so as mediocre as the food was who knows what might actually be in Tikka Masala. Very unfriendly environment, if you aren't really out for a dinner or lunch experience and just want so so food, this might be OK but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Everything was crazy delicious, tender, and flavorful. We got the Shahi paneer, chicken tikka masala, and the lamb korma. I recommend all! I had never had lamb korma-- its safe to say this is one my my new favorites! This place tastes like a little bit of India, and I will definitely be back soon. I can't wait to try the buffet!"}
{"text":"My wife, Chicago-resident son, and I stopped by after missing a movie, and except for the absence of beer and wine, which we understand is temporary and can be resolved for now by BYO, our dining experience was excellent. We even polished off the sauces, which had  contained lamb boti masala and vegetable pakoras (fritters). The whole wheat paratha with cottage cheese and herbs was buttery and light, and we left nothing of the main dish of tandoori chicken ginger kabobs. We will return, beer in hand until the bar is open, before we go back to Indian restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Chicken and shrimp Tiki Masala was sublime! Garlic naan melts in your mouth and was an ideal companion with the tiki masala! Another great find! Thank you Groupon!"}
{"text":"We came in for the lunch buffet on a Saturday, and I have to say it was probably the best lunch buffet I've ever had in the valley. Granted at $11.99 a person it was a little pricier compared to other Indian buffets, however that included a beverage and they even offered champagne as a beverage choice with refills! The food was delicious to say the least. The sauces were creamy, not watered down like at some buffets. The Chicken Tikka Masala had so much meat in it and tasted amazing. The variety of dishes overall was spot on with all your favorites present. I also loved the Chicken Vindaloo, it had the tenderest chicken in it. I would recommend this place highly for some really good quality food with excellent flavor."}
{"text":"Having recently turned vegetarian for health reasons, I wondered if the Paneer Tikka Masala could be half as good as their Chicken Tikka Masala, which was the best I've had from England to NYC to Phx. Well, no need to worry because it was superb! Smooth and creamy, the dish melts in your mouth. There are numerous vegetarian options. I strongly suggest samosas to start, and you can't go wrong with their saag/palak, chana masala, either of the dahls, the yummy okra dish, or the aloo gobi with savory cauliflower and potatoes. Add rice and garlic naan and you will have a delicious  meal. Take some home too cuz it's even better the next day!  Friendly and courteous staff, and the owner usually stops by every table."}
{"text":"Growing up, I always ate at Indian restaurants with my family, so I have a pretty good idea of what good, fresh Indian food tastes like. I am so glad that I moved right down the street from Nandini because they bring great, delicious food to the table.

I first tried this restaurant on August 28th for dinner with my boyfriend. When we were seated we got complimentary pink lemonade and some papadum to share. We ordered the Chicken tikka masala, baingan bharta, naan, and rice. Everything came out in a timely fashion and was nice and hot. The naan tasted like it had just come out of the tandoori oven. The flavors were delicious and right on target. As we finished up, we got some complimentary gulab jamun for dessert. I walked out that night one happy girl.

Finally, on September 14th I got to come back to try the lunch buffet. They had all of the classic favorites out plus a few other dishes. Expect to see chicken tikka masala, shahi paneer, palak paneer, chicken vindaloo, dal makhani, among others. You can choose either basmati rice or vegetable biryani. They also have some desserts such as gulab jamnu, rice kheer and carrot halwa. Another plus of the buffet is that they have self-serve mango lassi and give every table garlic naan! What more could you ask for, for only $6.99 a person?!? So inexpensive for such a great deal of food and drink.

I have already been there 4 times (3 times in 2 weeks) and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The owner recognizes my boyfriend and I every time we walk in the door, he is such a nice gentleman. The wait staff are also good, keeping drinks filled and always asking if we need anything. This is definitely my new favorite lunch spot! 

Recommend to any Indian cuisine connoisseur."}
{"text":"We were in the area craving Indian and found this place on Yelp. Drove past it and had to turn around so be mindful of that. Servers/management are very friendly and attentive. Lunch buffet was pretty freakin good and it comes with champagne. I decided to have a King Fisher instead and they didn't charge. If your I. The area check it out."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian buffet around. 
The only place I've tried where the \"spicy\" actually has some kick. The Chicken Vindaloo was wonderful. 

Plenty of vegetarian options and they are also tastier than average buffet offerings. 

This place is really under appreciated... It should have been packed but before Noon on a Sunday very few were there. 

Highly recommend if you like Indian cuisine.  Don't overlook this great tasting food!

Update:  our third or fourth time here, and I seem to appreciate it more each time. 

Honestly people, if you like Indian food, don't miss Nandinis!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 2 months now. The lunch buffet is so delicious and after going here 2 times in a one week, I had to give them props. Very Very good food. Clean bathrooms, too! The decor and ambiance leaves a little to desire but the food and service trump that. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"Nandini has delicious, authentic Indian food at a very affordable price.  I am always leery about a lunch buffet, but the food was very fresh and tasty and the fresh baked Naan was fantastic.  I will definitely come here again when I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars because even at the very end of their buffet time the food was still wonderful and flavorful. Additionally for 3 adults the bill came to $22.70! The garlic naan was yummy and there was a nice variety at the buffet. Complimentary mango lassi and chai tea. Clean restaurant that could be good for groups. Will be back."}
{"text":"Nandini is my new favorite Indian restaurant in AZ!  Everything we ordered was delicious. And we received exceptional service from the servers that showed they really wanted us to have a good experience in their restaurant.  They even gave us complimentary champagne when my husband said it was my birthday.  I definitely recommend this place and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Rice portion were a little smaller. But you could get two bowls of rice and split a curry pretty well if there were two of you. The service was pretty average. Not a very lively bunch. Delicious pistachio naan."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate lunch there together.  They had a buffet only lunch menu. I was very disappointed...at first but after investigating the HUGE selection of 8 entrees and 2 kinds of rice as well as rice pudding, yummy carrot thingy I can't recall the name of and small salad bar I must say it enticed me back to see their dinner menu. Worth a return visit for sure.  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Ordered delivery around lunch time and my first experience with these guys did not disappoint! Only waited maybe 45 minutes from the time my order was placed. The samosas were perfect and came with both chutneys. Mulligatawny soup was very good however it was not as creamy as I'm used to and was full of chicken! Which was delicious but in the past I thought this was a vegetarian/creamy yellow soup. Guess other places do dishes differently. Garlic naan was what you'd expect only a bit chewy from being steamed in the foil. The malai kofta was also different than what I'm used to and this I didn't care for much; it was very red/tomatoey, even a little sweet and not at all spicy. The dumplings were more like meatballs than the loaves I not know I prefer. 
All in all a great lunch! Will order again for sure."}
{"text":"I went here for their buffet lunch. I think over all their food was ok. I had their goat curry and it was too salty for my taste. Their garlic naan was pretty burnt so it added a bitter taste. Service was good. But overall I don't think I'll come here again."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is amazing!! When I came in there was only one guy working. But that guy was busting his ass off! He was working hard and served 3 familys, 1 women, and a couple, us. And our food arrived at our table at a reasonable time! Enough about the hard working guy though and on with the food.

We ordered 
-Chicken tikki masala (spicy)
-lamb vindaloo(spicy)
-basmati rice
-plain nann
-garlic nann
-water

Everything we ordered was great, besides the water, that was a little plain.

But really the food was soooooo freakin good. The first bite I took sent me into an orgasmic state and my toes started to curl. The second bite made my eyes roll back and my back arch. By the fourth bite my wife was starting to question if some other woman was giving me a bj under the table! Well, unfortunately there wasn't any women under the table but the food sure was great!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent little buffet. Very filling. And a variation of flavors. Almost hard to eat more than one plate because the cuisine is so filling with the rice. Super nice staff. A must try"}
{"text":"The only thing I liked about the place was Chicken Tikka Masala and Lassi. I heard some good reviews about Garlic Naan but it didn't met my expectation. We ordered Dal Tadka and requested them to make it spicy. It seemed they just poured a box of red chilli powder. Even after being from Rajasthan, I felt it was way too spicy for a normal human being. We also ordered Shahi Paneer,  I felt cheated after tasting it. The gravy was same as it was for Chicken Tikka Masala. They should know the difference between a Shahi Paneer and Paneer Tikka Masala. At last we ordered a Mango Lassi which was yummy and would recommend it to be in your order list."}
{"text":"Fantastic new Indian restaurant tucked away in a Tempe strip mall. Had the lunch buffet and everything was amazing from the food to the service. I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala was bomb! only downside was I paid $23 for a small little bowl and 2 pieces of garlic naan. :p Would have love to gotten a little bit more for such a hefty price!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, great service, and at a reasonable price. I highly recommend checking out this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Went today with the family as we were craving indian food. Ending up doing their lunch buffet. They had a great selection of the usual lamb, chicken, and vegetarian dishes. My personal favorites of all the ones I tried was the Paneer Shahi and the Chicken Tikka Masala. These two dishes accompanied by their Garlic Naan was delicious. Very garlicky and not too oily (some other restaurants make their Naan with quite a bit of lard).

The only thing that I could really ding this place on was the cleanliness. The linens looked like they hadn't been laundered in years (and were quite dirty) and some of the \"clean\" dishes I grabbed for on going to the buffet table wasn't actually clean.

Overall, I would definitely say give this place a chance based on the Indian cuisine but would really recommend you bring some wet wipes to clean your table beforehand."}
{"text":"The decor may appear to be simple but the food is delicious.  The goat curry and the shrimp vindaloo are both great choices.  A variety of tasty sauces accompany delicious breads.

Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Walked in for dinner with my husband. Ordered Garlic Naan , Malai Kofta, Aaloo Gobi and Peas pulao. They served us pepper papad with sweet sauce and mint chutney(complimentary). The sweet sauce and mint chutney were good, though, the mint chutney could have been a bit more fresh. 

The Garlic Naan, Malai Kofta , Aaloo Gobi and Peas Pulao were brought at the same time which is good. The food was served hot which is what we really like. The Naan was very good and it wasn't burnt. We had requested them to make the subzis spicy. The malai kofta was totally  yummy. The kofta was so tasty and fried to perfection. We just wish they had more paneer in the kofta. It was more of potato. The gravy was so good and had the right amount of spiciness and masala. The Aaloo Gobi was also very tasty. The potato and cauliflower were cooked perfectly.

The peas pulao was different though. They had added tomatoes i suppose. Not sure. The rice was good. No complaints, but it was not the authentic peas pulao that we expected. 

We thought we would go for desert too so ordered Carrot Halwa. Now this was a total let down. It wasn't halwa nor was it carrot kheer. The carrot was not cooked and milk was still there and it required a lot more sugar and we couldn't find any nuts. Thoroughly disappointed.

Overall, we liked the food and we shall surely go there again. We are yet to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful. We tried it out on a Groupon and it's become one of our favorite places. The staff is so nice and the service is really fast.

Great food! I'm not nervous to try new things each time because every time I do it's good."}
{"text":"Great food!  I'm only here on Sundays around 11:00 AM for their buffett.

Now, they offer the following:

Garlic Naan, which you never get on a buffet.

Samosas - sometimes, their Sunday buffet has fresh samosas, call ahead to check.

Free drinks (hot Indian tea, soda, unsweetened tea etc)

Mango Lassi (usually $3 more at other places in Tempe).

Desert included!

Super fast service - the naan is brought out hot and fresh while you are still grabbing your first plate.

I couldn't have been happier!"}
{"text":"So we read the reviews and also bought a $30 groupon. Good that we did, the bill with 3 sodas and 3 meals plus naan (which was good) was $60 with tax before the Groupon voucher.  

Chicken biryani...good but chicken was a little chewy in some bites.

Chicken saag...great. kids loved it.

Goat curry...very good. Hubby wanted all leftovers to take home.

Wait staff was very attentive.  Food came out quickly, and they gave us complimentary chips and a \"sweet\" for dessert.  They also invited us back for buffet, 7d a week at lunch only.

The best part...Indians came to eat there, so it must be authentic :)"}
{"text":"Found a Groupon and tried some takeout. Loved the 2 curry dishes! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I and my husband had been to nandini on sunday for lunch buffet . Food was tasty and good quality also, curries were perfect spicy which we Indians prefer. We are vegetarians there are lot of vegetarian dishes. We were invited by one of our friend to this restaurant. The owner of this restaurant was humble and well mannered he personally came to us asked how was the food. Also offered us special Indian chai after our lunch as we were there for long time chatting with friend. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Food tastes like a reheated food from yesterday. We went to a Friday buffet and it was horrible. Can guess how it would look like for another weekday buffet, because usually Fridays and Saturday buffets are special for indian restaurants. 
The amount of artificial food color used in almost every food was frightening . We know the food color is cheap for the restaurant but it is expensive for the people's health on the long run. 
All the curries and even desserts and chicken has excess food color. Did that help the taste? no.
Same grevey was used for both chicken and paneer curries, that's not how indian food is prepared in the first place. We don't make the grevey first and add whatever you feel like and boil or reheat it. 
These guys ruined our day and thanks to all those who gave the misleading 5 stars to this place."}
{"text":"For reference, I came here on a Sunday for the lunch buffet.  The selection was pretty minimal, but that's not a huge deal to me -- quality over quantity, right?  Overall, I'd say that the food is pretty tasty.  I especially love the kheer, the rice pudding dessert, and their tandoori was spectacular (and I don't particularly like chicken off the bone!).  I thought that some of their dishes could use a bit more basic seasoning, like salt; maybe it was just that particular batch, though.  I do prefer other Indian restaurants in the area, but for $6.95 for all you can eat, there's little to complain about.  If I were nearby, I would easily come back again.  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a five star place that I am thankful to have found through Groupon. I ordered my favorites and was wowed by them all. I thought, am I tripping? How is this the best Indian food I have had? The two people I was with also have it five stars so there you go, not a doubt in the world that this food is worth checking out."}
{"text":"We got coupon from Groupon, ordered to go. Pretty good! But super salty. But my husband like them. Pretty good curry!"}
{"text":"Read yelpers reviews, my girl Krissy never has tried Indian, had to order Tandori chicken also ordered Paneer Tikka Masala both super, the basmati rice & naan garlic real good. Portions big and the waiter gave us s tasty desert & said try the lunch Buffet it's only $6.99, if I lived here I sure would. This is an unexpected nice treat & real cheap"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of indian food. I don't think I have ever had \"bad\" indian food. It's probably because they put so many spices in their food. I lived really close to this place so it was my go to Indian Spot. I spent a lot of money on Delivery and even though I lived about 5 minutes from this place, one time it took them 2+ hours to get to my place. However, dinning in is pretty nice. 

I would recommend this place. :D"}
{"text":"It's damn good. Standard Indian buffet, with chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, mango lassi, etc etc. Fresh delicious garlic naan. Mmmmm. Super good. Tandoori chicken is usually very dry, but flavor is there. It's like $7 bucks per person for lunch buffet. Liked it"}
{"text":"Such a great place for Indian food!! Very casual, the restaurant is fairly large. The service was great. The best part of this place though is the food. I had the Malai Kofta (I'm 100% sure I spelled that incorrectly) and OMG! So yummy. I really have no complaints at all. I would highly recommend this place for some good Indian grub!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness the food was so wonderful at this place!  And the service was sublime. We will be returning as the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  Wish I could find something similar in Nortern California! Flavors are well balanced yet potent enough to confirm that this is the real deal! 

Everything I tried in the buffet tasted great.  Love those curry dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent and potent flavors! The combination of garlic naan and various main dishes was fantastic! The food pairs great with an Indian beer even. Next time I stop by will be for the daily buffet from 11am-2pm to try a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Biryani. Chicken was well cooked and sufficient in quantity. The rice was ok but not sure if it was Basmati. The spice level was just nice. The raita(yogurt)  that came along with was good too. Will probably go back here"}
{"text":"Tried À la carte and loved it; very tasty food. Looking forward to trying the lunch buffet over the weekend. :-)"}
{"text":"Good food. Been here once and had the buffet. It was good food in less price. 
Great for students."}
{"text":"Tasty Indian food in Tempe near the college. The service was quick and pleasant, and the atmosphere was quite and subdued. Great place to catch up with friends without have to yell over the music!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Indian food and I am hooked because of Nandini. The service was perfect, the restaurant was clean, and the food was delicious. Butter chicken was amazing and oh the naan!!! So good. Everyone needs to give this place a try. They even have vegan options."}
{"text":"Was ok.  The lamb seemed over cooked and a bit dry.  However the curry gravy was top notch ."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was awesome. Place looks authentic and the food is authentic. And the price was not bad at all for the quality and service I received. I'm so loaded up on paneer and naan I'm about to explode"}
{"text":"Nandinis is hands down the best Indian Buffett in the valley. 
the rice is perfect, mango lassi and chai come with the meal (and they are both delicious), and all the food is spectacular. I love the tandoori chicken, spinach (paneer I think?) and the paneer masala. Oh an the naan, it is uncomparable. So hot and so garlicky, it might be worth the trip just for the naan. The buffet also has dessert. I am a massive fan of their rice pudding. 
So food is 5 stars. 
Service is also 5 stars. We were given plenty of attention and rarely had a dirty dish on the table. The Buffett has a nice ambience and is very clean. At around $11-12 for weekends and $9-10 on weekdays, this place it is affordable but I wish it were a bit cheaper so I could come more often. That being said it is probably some of the best Indian food you will ever eat in Arizona."}
{"text":"I had been craving Indian food for a while now and when Karen W. suggested this spot for our lunch, I was immediately onboard. It faces Broadway Road, east of McClintock, with ample parking. I walked inside and was greeted and even told that my friend had already arrived and been seated. I'd never been here before but the tables are setup with silverware and water and the plates are at the beginning of the buffet. They also have mango lassi and chai which was an unexpected but pleasant perk. The mango lassi was thick and sweet, and I enjoyed it but would like to try it with a stronger tart, mango flavor. 

I started with getting both the white basmati rice and the biryani and then surveyed the choices of dishes. There was good variety and a lot of veggie options to accommodate vegetarians. I tried basically everything, including the chicken tikka masala, spiced chicken, and chicken drumsticks. They had the classics like paneer, palak, aloo, curry, daal, pakora, etc. Salad was available but it was your basic iceberg, tomato, cucumber combo so I passed. Hot garlic naan was brought to our table once we got our plates as well. 

I liked the pakora, paneer (cheese) and the palak (spinach), surprisingly since I prefer spinach raw. But it had a bit of heat to it, which leads to my one main complaint about this place. I would've liked to see spicier selections as everything was pretty mild. Maybe so that it can cater to more folks, but mama likes her heat. They had mint yogurt and tamarind sauce, which are soothing, and a pickle sauce I didn't try. 

The dessert selection was nice, I tried gulab jamun (I bit into it and was surprised that it was hot!), carrot halwa, and the round sugary circles. They also had some sort of yogurt, which I did not try. 

Nandini was a lot of food at a great value. I really appreciated that the drinks were included in the buffet and that the owner/manager let me wrap up the leftover naan to take home. I would definitely come back and inquire about modifying the spice level on my plate."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and during that time its buffet. It was delicious!  My husband LOVES spiced food and this was just enough to satisfy her craving. Everything had so much flavor. We want to go back one evening to try their dinner menu. 

My only \"complaint\" is that the wall we were sitting next to needed to be wiped down and the table cloth, underneath a glass topper, need to be washed. They had a significant amount food splatters on them. I could see how this might deter some people from coming back. Not me though. The food was amazing."}
{"text":"I visited this place initially when they re-christened as Nandini. Quality in lunch buffets can go south but at Nandini when I visited the following were what I found to be turn offs : 
1. They served rice in a cooker ( could have changed over time) 
2. The naans were extremely greasy and charred 
3. Almost all the curries I tried were greasy and bland 

I hope they have/ will improve and serve better food ."}
{"text":"Garlic naan is addictive! Lunch buffet you just can't beat and champagne included on the weekends."}
{"text":"First time to Nandini tonight - and it is our new favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix.  Warm and friendly service, with absolutely delicious food.  We ordered the benghan bartha, chicken tikka masala, shrimp vindaloo and onion kulcha.  They were all excellent, and just the perfect spice level (we ordered medium and it was definitely spicy).  The onion kulcha was the best I've had anywhere.  We would order each of them again, but definitely want to try other things on the menu.  This will be a regular spot for us, from now on."}
{"text":"We saw this on Yelp when visiting on Memorial weekend.  The selections are great and delicious.  Mango lassi is good and service is great."}
{"text":"Very good food! Ordered the lamb vindaloo and it was perfrctly spiced. It had so much flavor to it. Service was amazing! The waiter was very attentive and cordial. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I went here for the lunch buffet.  Everything was fresh and hot.  They server garlic naan on request which was great!  Great selection with all the traditionals egg curry, tandori chicken.  Also, a small salad bar and dessert!  To top it off the buffet was only $7.50 per person.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"ROCK SOLID!! Just went for the lunch buffet and can't begin to describe the VALUE. Fresh Naan bread brought to the table piping hot. Great selection of Meat and Vegetarian options. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in a long time. Service was great and quick. Great butter chicken and the mild was plenty spicy and flavorful! Definitely a new go-to!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST tandoori chicken we have ever had! Every dish we tried was so fresh, flavorful and full of spice. The owner and server were very accommodating and welcoming. He took our requests for \"sinus clearing\" hot and delivered just that! The naan was perfectly cooked with that delicious bit of char on the ends and the nice bite of garlic. The lamb vindaloo was spicy and we were pleasantly surprised with the generous portion of lamb. Everything was superb and we are already planning our next visit! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a family favorite for years, even when it was under different management and called the Royal Taj.  The service is great, atmosphere is friendly and the food is delicious.  We always order too much so we can enjoy leftovers the next day.  The buffet is great.  We often take advantage of Groupon and Entertainment offers and they never give us trouble.  

My son returned from a 6-month stay in India and couldn't wait to get back to Tempe and dine with us at some of the local Indian restaurants.  This one is his favorite, for all the reasons I listed above.  We went there last night and, as always, enjoyed the experience.  We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Staff is attentive, service is great, and the food is absolutely amazing!  Recommend anyone in the Phoenix area make the trip to this awesome little place!"}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best Indian food restaurant in Tempe. The Tandoori Chicken Saag is my ultimate favorite but their Lamb Saag is great as well as their Lamb Korma, Lamb Rogan Josh, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala ... ok, I could go on but, I'll spare you. 

For appetizers - try their Samosa Chaat - it's so fresh and flavorful. 

I saw someone else comment that their tomato soup wasn't good and I highly disagree! It too is super fresh and flavorful. It's definitely on the spicy side so that may be why it wasn't up their alley.

I've been frequenting Nandini since it was Royal Taj (so for about 3 years now) and I've never been disappointed in the food or service (both are just wonderful). I've tried other Indian restaurants in the area and not one holds a candle to Nandini's level of cuisine. I started out being afraid of spice and have moved up to preferring my dishes \"Indian Spicy.\" Thanks, Nandini!"}
{"text":"Great reviews from others led us here for lunch on a Sunday. They've only been open a couple of months, and have Daily lunch buffet (not just weekdays). We have tried a couple of other Indian buffets in Phoenix and were not terribly impressed by the food. My meal today was Ridiculously Delicious, prices inexpensive and service was outstanding. We will be back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but over priced for the portions.  I ordered chicken curry, rice, curried potatoes and i piece of bread and it was nearly  $50 with delivery fees and was bearly enough for me and my husband to share."}
{"text":"We've driven by there many times and saw that the restaurant had changed it's name. Since we saw a Groupon for them, decided to give it a try. We looove Indian food and always order the same dishes to \"test the water\". We ordered Chicken Saag and a smoked eggplant curry dish which I never know how to spell. We ordered medium hot and to us they were more hot than we are used to. Next time we will order mild. Service was prompt and friendly. Priced right and portions were good. It's a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I had the Entertainment coupon and had to try their dinners. It was amazing. The garlic naan was good and not dried up like others. 
The lunch buffet was tasty without overly pricey. 

Good place for Indian food."}
{"text":"Pulling up to this place the 1st good indicator, lotsa Indians outside with obvious full & happy bellies. 
The atmosphere could've been any restaurant. Nothing Indian abou it, but that's fine. It was clean & didn't smell like sweaty feet.
The buffet is just a few tems & I tasted them all. Very good! The nan was great & plentiful & the service efficient.  BUT the draw if this place is that it's really inexpensive...$7. I'll keep this place in mind at the end of the month & needing to rob the coin jar."}
{"text":"This place is great! My boyfriend and I have eaten here twice after buying the Groupon. With the Groupon it is a reasonably priced meal. The service is great, and the food is delicious and so flavorful. Overall it has a very clean and pleasant vibe!"}
{"text":"The spices were very vibrant in each dish and definitely excited my palette as I have never had food like this before. Although I've never been to India, this is what I would imagine the authentic cuisine to taste like. I enjoyed everything at this quaint buffet. From the tandoori chicken to the curry, the flavor profiles were bursting with uniqueness! 

Don't sleep on this quaint Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wanting some hot Vindaloo from a new place my friend and I stopped here for dinner. We had the Chicken Vindaloo with a 5 heat to be on the safe side. That and the smoked eggplant dish which name I can't remember. It was delicious, really they both were. Some Garlic Naan and rice and we were set. 
     The water was always refilled but it took forever to get a soda and beer. Our server spent more time with a table of 20 containing friends than the other tables. So he is 2 stars and the food was a 5 star delight."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Food didn't taste fresh and looked like it was cooked the previous day . Taste and spices were way off. Got naan when I was about to finish the food and was burnt . Worse  buffet I had in life."}
{"text":"I stopped in because its close and has great reviews this was my first time with Indian food and it was a good introduction I tried the chicken tikka , palak paneer and garlic naan all very tasty and enough for another meal I will come back and try some other menu items very friendly owner  too and they gave me a free dessert too what a happy surprise thank you Nandini"}
{"text":"I was excited to find this restaurant close to my new apartment. It was clean and the service was attentive. The sauce, rice, and naan were all good, but the meat in my butter chicken was really stringy and low quality. I wasn't even quite sure that it was chicken. If they had used better quality meat, then it would have been 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"For about $7, this buffet is a great deal. Mango nectar and hot chai tea are included with the buffet, a nice touch, and garlic naan is made freshly right to your table. 

The buffet itself consisted of a mix of various popular vegetarian and chicken based dishes. Such items included paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, aloo tikki, chicken vindaloo, aloo gobi, and saag. There's a salad bar with various dressings, and a selection of carrot halwa, gulab jamun, and kheer/rice pudding for dessert. 

My favorite dish out of the buffet items was the aloo gobi. It had a great mix of flavor, and had large chunks of potato and cauliflower. The tikka masala dishes I tried were very heavy on the cream, and had a mild flavor. The chicken vindaloo, normally a very spicy dish, was probably about a medium level of spice.

Service was good. Dishes were taken away promptly and water was refilled as needed.

While other buffets might have more selection and better preparation, Nandini pares down the items to cut down on cost, and includes beverages to add more value for your dollar."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service very on top of our needs and made us feel comfortable. Food was very flavorful, yet a bit pricer then what I had expected."}
{"text":"this is by far the best Indian buffet in the area. it's always so fresh and amazing, you get as much fresh warm naan as you want, and as much mango lassi as well. Nandinis is SO good!"}
{"text":"Gross

1st time here
Flys all over

Milksweet dessert rubbery

Yuch i will not b back
Worst indian place ever
Unsanitary"}
{"text":"We came here twice in 2 weeks as not to lose our Groupon Value. So glad we changed up our old Indian restaurant in Tempe. The place is big, plenty of tables, service is very good along with the food. We came the first time on a Saturday at 7 and a weeknight at 7, both time there was open seating.

We ordered King Fishers (beer) and snacked on complementary Papadom while perusing the menu. We started with the Vegetable Samosa. Entrees were the Boneless Chicken Vindaloo, Tandoori Chicken, Basmati Plain Rice, and a Garlic Naan. On the second occasion we opted to try the Boneless Chicken Tiki Marsala. All the dishes we requested on a 1-10 in spiciness ,a 7 and 8. The Samosas were the best I've ever had. All the chicken dishes were very good, perfect heat at 7 and 8. The Tandoori Chicken portion was huge. The Naan was fresh and perfectly crispy/soft.

Glad to find a new place for us, food and service a winner."}
{"text":"The service was friendly. The food was great. I ordered samosas, garlic naan, chicken vindaloo, and chicken biryani. Everything was amazing and full of flavor. Portions were large enough for me to have lunch and dinner the next day! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Good food,  casual.  The naan bread was a must get.  Tried the lamb curry and chicken vindaloo.  The lamb curry gets five stars,  the chicken not so much due to the fat not trimmed off.  I don't claim to be an expert on Indian food so take this with a grain of salt.  However,  the staff was very friendly and it's evident they're doing their best to bring authentic Indian food to tempe."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, right level of spice and lots of flavour and great service, we felt very welcome here, thank you"}
{"text":"At first glance the place does not seem like much. The place is pretty plain as far decor goes. The food was very tasty, we got the chicken Marsala, butter chicken, and garlic naan. The service was fast and friendly, I would expect it to be as it was a slower night. In all we would have rated it a 3 or 4, but the owner came over and chatted with us and gave is a free desert without us even asking which pushed the up a notch. We will be going back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was amazing! The most delicious curry I personally have ever had and the assortment of dishes was fantastic. Highly recommend this place and the mango/coconut tea for dessert magnificent!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The ambiance is lacking, but the food more than makes up for it. We have eaten at almost every Indian Food place in the East Valley, and this is one of our top 3."}
{"text":"Great service, great flavors. WOW!  can't wait to go back.  My co-workers visiting from India put this at the top of the list for authentic flavors of home. Good for all-veggie/vegan options.  We had the buffet, which was good variety and really good quality.

The place is clean, but very simple décor."}
{"text":"Let me just say right off the bat that I was NOT impressed with this place--in fact, it's probably the worst Indian food I have ever had!  

I went with a meetup group and the organizer had made reservations (which we didn't need), but the man in charge had no record of a reservation.  He did, however, have tables already put together that would accommodate our small group of 7.  After we sat down he brought us water....no \"welcome....our buffet is over there\" or anything--I'm serious--no words came out of that man's mouth.

We got up and got in line at the very small buffet--maybe 8 items....10 at the most.  That's not including the desserts (as they were) or the salad which was a typical Indian buffet salad:  iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, & white onions.

The food was barely warm, not particularly fresh and not particularly good.  The same man brought naan to us after we sat down....again, not a word.  I got up and asked for a knife and he handed me a handful of them to be distributed to my co-diners.   

When we were done I asked for my check (again, I had to get up no ask for it).  Same man said \"10.80.\"  I got my purse and took out $12, handed it to him and left.  Not sure why I gave him a $1.20 tip--thought I should be nice, I guess.

I will definitely NOT return to this place and do NOT recommend that you even venture in."}
{"text":"Was not disappointed!! My husband and I found Nandinis in our Entertainment book (we're always looking for great Indian so we were excited to try it out). It was awesome! It is a tad pricey, but the food and service was great. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Upon walking in the restaurant,  we were a bit put off. There was a strong sewage smell and the interior looked like it had seen its best days in the early 80's. HOWEVER, we stuck it out and ordered.
The food was worth enduring the smell. We ordered chicken biriyani and chicken tikka masala. Both were some of the best we've ever tried. A little disappointed that rice didnt come with the chicken dish and cost extra...but even so, it didnt dampen the experience.
Like others we were given a complimentary drink (pink lemonade) and dessert (donut holes in syrup), which was a nice add-on.
Service was very good. The gentleman that waited on us was very friendly and quick to help us."}
{"text":"Sometimes when you go out, you can really good good, but lack luster service...and when this was true of the previous owners. But today, the interior is beautifully updated, the services is wonderfully friendly, and the good is just as awesome, if not better. Great buffet and lunch specials...and the owner comes out to give you recommendations and specials personally. It's tucked away, but a jewel in this strip mall."}
{"text":"This is my new spot. I suggest the butter chicken, it's the best I've had in a while.  My best friend is Punjabi and opened me up to Indian food. This place is legit, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The guy that owns this place is very customer oriented. I'm not even sure if he's the owner or not. Who ever he is, he is really into keeping customers happy. The best part is he is very reasonable with time. He was catering for a party once and i walked in to make a take out order. He told me the wait would be about an hour and half before i ordered. I can tell he wanted to make sure i was ok with it. Because he was honest I decided to stay and order food. It actually took and hour and half and he called to let me know when the food was ready. He didn't rush through the order and he took the time to cook everything properly. His lunch buffet is always a good deal. I would go early so that way you're not getting the left overs. Even then the buffet is freshly stocked."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. The best Indian Food I have ever had, and I have eaten Indian food everywhere in phoenix. The servers were so attentive and they brought us complimentary dessert. I loved the chicken tikka masala and the paneer was to die for. I also highly recommend the garlic naan and the naan with indian cottage cheese. This place really deserves 10 stars, not just 5. The atmosphere was great. I really hope that this place does well; they certainly deserve too. I am glad that they are in Tempe!

Thank you again for all your kindness tonight!"}
{"text":"Omg the vegetable korma is amazing. So glad this place is back and remodeled some. Great location to my house. I picked up take out tonight and  I should have stopped a plate ago but it's so good!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for years, love what the new owners have done. Best buffet in Tempe, spice level is above average, great selections, naan was good, deserts and mango lasse all bomb. Service was great, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Royal Taj was good.  Nandini is great!  Fresh, perfectly spiced, friendly and attentive service.  The food is better than ever!  Come try it!"}
{"text":"Top notch Northern Style Indian food I've had in this town. Very comforting food and staff was pleasant. Went for the buffet and, although the Chicken Vindaloo only had the sauce and some vegetables left by 130pm... I went back for seconds strictly for that sauce!! Giving it 5 stars for the fact it was a refreshing change of pace and expectation for Phoenix. Definitely for those who appreciate the difference in the regional approach to some of these classic dishes. Oh and yes.... free mango lassi and  garlic naan included."}
{"text":"Update: The owner of the restaurant was prompt in responding to me on seeing my review. It felt nice to know that someone cared about me as a customer.  He was very apologetic and I am willing to give Nandini another go at some point."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time tonight. The service and food were great and I like how they asked how spicy we wanted our food; Sometimes it can be a wildcard as to how hot the food will come out in some restaurants. We will be back its always a pleasant surprise to find such a good restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Finally!! Spicy and legit Indian. Good sized portions and excellent service. So glad we found this place."}
{"text":"It's decent, but not special.  

- The chicken tikka masala was pretty bland.  Not very tomatoey and not spicy at all
- The chicken curry had good flavor and spice
- The saag paneer was very good.  Full of spinach with a hint of heat
- The tandoori chicken was tender and had a nice mild flavor
- The rice pudding was excellent
- Solid service

Overall, it's good, but there are better buffets out there that I'd prefer to go to."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've found in the Valley, by far.

Seriously. Anyone who says vegetarian food is boring needs to try this place! My favorite is the Malai Kofta, which is CRAZY DELICIOUS ground veggie and Indian cottage dumplings simmered in nuts and a creamy sauce. I've also enjoyed the garlic naan, Samosa Chaat, Mutter Paneer and Palak Paneer here. 

If you like your Indian food spicy, as I do, emphasize spicy/very spicy when you order. 

I happen to agree with others that you really shouldn't have to pay for rice with your entree...but I've found that one order of rice is plenty for two people to share, so that helps. As for those that complain about portion size, they are right, you don't get a huge portion, but then again this isn't Applebee's. Neither of these things are big enough issues for me to deduct a star or stop coming here.

I can't wait for the next time I'm in Tempe as this is an obvious choice for delicious food with efficient and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Ordered food here and loved our dishes. The garlic naan was cooked perfectly. Will definitely come back here. So glad it's not far from my house!!"}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp and took a chance for dinner. It paid off--the food was super good."}
{"text":"Between New Delhi, Curry Corner, and Nandini it's pretty hard to decide which is my favorite. The palak paneer is amazing!! Perfect blend of earthy spices and the Indian cheese is soft, not chewy or anything."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Indian food and I was very impressed and love it!!!  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"A local search for an indian food fix vetted this relatively new spot in Southeast Tempe for a nice lunch buffet option. Fate would have it that the place is owned and managed by the previous manager of Indian Oven (a place I used to be of check-in royalty for), and all the food is just as delicious and fresh as I can remember.

Spot on for value (~$8 lunch buffet) too!

From talking with the guy, he is planning to introduce a delivery food service after hours (10PM+) for the hungry late night crowd in the area! When another night of filberto's just doesn't sound appealing anymore, this could bring a really great alternative for the area.."}
{"text":"Food is freaking amazing but there is one problem with my experience. 

Waiter decided to give me and my girl an order of garlic Naan even though we did not order/want it. We asked why he gave it to us when we didn't order it and he said \"most people like eating this type of Naan with what you ordered\". Now we thought this was nice of him for giving us an order of what we thought was complimentary Naan. But the bill came and we were charged the $ 2.19 for the Naan we didn't even order. So we took it out of his tip. No big deal but really lame of him to do that to us and not very professional and imply it was free after we inquired about it.

But the food is amazing I recommend anything on the menu and you've got to get basmati rice with any entree you decide."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch with a large group!  
They have great traditional Indian food.  The buffet has a large selection and the owner/server was very polite and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is awesome with very friendly staff. We received complimentary papadum. We ordered Shahi paneer, Malai kofta, garlic naan and haywards 5000 indian beer. They also gave us some complimentary raita. The food is delicious, one of the best shahi paneer and malai kofta My husband and I have had. The restaurant is very open. The music is played at a reasonable volume. Parking is easy. The staff is very social and makes you feel very welcome. Next time we are in Tempe we will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Yummo! We ordered the vegetable biryani, vegetable korma and shrimp vindaloo. We left with lunch for tomorrow too. Huge portions. Great flavor. Fabulous service.

I'm stuffed. You should get stuffed too."}
{"text":"Love their lunch time buffet for just $10.  The bread is awesome too.  Environment is casual, very simple and clean.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  We came here for the lunch buffet and the food and service were AMAZING.  The staff members were friendly and came by often to fill up our water.  Garlic Naan was brought to our table.  There was a wide variety of items up at the buffet.  My personal favorites were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the mango drink.  

The lunch buffet value was amazing... just $9.95 for a huge meal with drinks included.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Being my first experience with Indian food, I was very pleased. We ordered chicken tikka Masala, chicken vindaloo, garlic naan, and the lamb biryani. The flavor of the sauces for tikka masala and vindaloo are very exquisite. The tikka masala has a sweet taste and vindaloo has a nice kick. Both had a good balance and the chicken and the lamb was tender and cooked very well. This has changed my view of Indian food and I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried this place for the first time tonight and it was delicious. Definitely one of our new favorite places. We had the tandoori chicken which was to die for and they specially made mushroom saag for me. The service was excellent as well. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Been trying to find a solid Indian buffet since we came to Phoenix.
Here's what I like:

1. They have probably the best garlic naan I've ever had (hot,  not burnt, moist but still a little crispy).
2. They have chicken tikka masala served the way I am used to. Very good!
3. They have unlimited indian tea
4. Their desserts are also very good.
5. The lunch buffet price is excellent and they serve the buffet on weekends! (this earned them the 5th star)"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices! We ordered the chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, lamb curry, garlic naan and a veggie samosa. I have been to some outstanding Indian restaurants and this one is in the top, with more competitive prices. We went for dinner, but I think next time we will try the lunch buffet which I heard is only $7.99!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say but it's the worst indian food I have ever had. The food is not fresh and tasted as if it was from previous day's buffet. I am from india and can tell easily by eating indian food if it's fresh or not. Waste of money at this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The owners and managers care and are very friendly. During dinner rice and naan are add ons."}
{"text":"I've never had Indian Cuisine, but I'm so glad I did!  What a wonderful meal!  Lunch buffet was amazing"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this restaurant for a while. So happy I stopped in. Phenomenal buffet. For $10 at lunch time just can't be beat. Awesome Curry tikka masala and tandoori chicken and they have those deep fried vegetables."}
{"text":"Buffet was hot, fresh, and flavorful. Hot garlic naan is served to your table. I really enjoyed having many also with my meal. Only thing wasn't spicy enough my my taste. They keep it mild for general populace."}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Came for buffet,  food tasted like it was prepared a day before. The garlic Naan was served after 25 min,  and all the Naans were burnt on the back side. Also the deserts were not made properly. The carrot halwa was not cooked properly."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet for 10 bucks, mango lassi, chai tea, some items in buffet were a lil spicy total plus, all ingredients were fresh and delicious and everyone working there was courteous and friendly, my new go too lunch spot when the craving for complex spices arouses"}
{"text":"Amazing buffet! Went on a Sunday late afternoon around 1:45. Chai tea and mango beverages included along with garlic naan. Chicken tikka and the potato masala were both excellent! Costs a little more on the weekend but after tip under $30 for 2 and full the rest of the day! Very friendly staff and ice cold water served (which means a lot to me, can't stand room temp water) Will go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I order take out and dine in at this restaraunt regularly. Staff is always friendly and food is delicious! My gf had never tried indian food before, I introduced her to chicken tikka masala and she loved it, great dish for anyone new to Indian food."}
{"text":"to be honest everything is kinda cold and I've had way better at new Indian gate. service is also slow."}
{"text":"I would rate this place 10 stars.  Quality is exceptional.  Price is cheep.  Came for the lunch while on a visit from LA  it's in same line with best Indian restaurant/buffets I have been at before.  One more important thing -  exceptionally nice and pleasant attitude.  

this is kind of a place where you can insist and force your stubborn,  food picky friends to come and know that they will like it.  Haha...."}
{"text":"I can't say which is better - the food or the service - as both are so excellent that you'll feel like you've been invited into a warm Indian home. A small, unadvertised restaurant in the very back corner of a relatively dead strip mall was the last place I expected to proudly tout as a favorite of mine. There is something for everyone at Nandini: from a selection of creamy, spicy curries; to the Biryani; to the fluffy naan bread - there is sure to be something that will strike your fancy."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is very good, especially at the price  the ambience is pleasant and the service friendly. This is not adventurous eating, very  American palate friendly, but the preparation is good. Outstanding paneer dish and moist Tandori chicken. The free chai is unsweetened and they also offer free mango lassi, a big plus. The only criticism for lunch was the nan, which was being cooked too quickly and burnt. Definitely will return to try dinner menu."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! The perfect mix of spices. The mango drink is the best!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the good reviews are coming from?!!

The buffet was priced at $6.99, which is a great price, and included mango lassi and chai, but the quality of food was poor. Every curry gravy was thick with corn flour, so much so we could not focus on the flavors. The decor is not much better from the days of the Taj. The gentleman who waited on us was friendly."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for groupon, we would have never found his place! 

We order a lot of food, Tandoor chicken, garlic bread (addicting), garlic rice, Chicken soup, and an appetizer or Gulag.

New flavors and new types of food! Can't get any better. The chicken soup was very small it was $6.99 so that took me by surprise. 

The Garlic bread was addicting be ware!! 

The tandoori chicken was very good. Had lots of flavors and different spices I haven't tried before. With garlic rice, it was a great combo. 

Get the groupon for a great deal."}
{"text":"Only tried the buffet and it was OK at best. Definitely not the worst. The service was pretty good but to be honest the place looks like a health hazard.

The dishes are all pretty mild and watered down tasting on the buffet.

For the price of $6.99. It's worth it for a quick bite though."}
{"text":"Haven't been out to the Tempe area in a while since I graduated from ASU but today I found myself in the area for work and I was craving Indian food. Was about to go to our usual Indian spot on university and rural when I yelped Nandini and the reviews were great. Now, I don't judge restaurants solely on yelp reviews but I decided to give Nandini a shot and I was really glad that I did. The interior was so clean and the lunch buffet was so affordable! Definitely comin back here for Indian when I'm in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Had our first meal here on a friend's recommendation and loved it! The service was great and food was delicious. I had the Chana masala with basmati rice and garlic naan. We also tried the vegetable samosas. I highly recommend this place. Definitely need to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and service was very friendly and accommodating.  Thanks so much! Will be back."}
{"text":"Chicken vindaloo, tikka masala & tandoori are deliciousness waiting to satisfy your mouth. Add in some delicious naan flat bread & mango lassi... would makes anyone's day!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a great experience, based on the reviews I had read.  Sadly disappointed.  The chicken curry was swimming in oil."}
{"text":"This is honestly some of THE BEST Indian food I've ever had. The owner (I'm assuming) of this place recognizes me every single time I walk in the door (I'm not a very frequent guest in their restaurant, either) -very polite man. It's a very quiet atmosphere to go on a date or just for a chill night out. The Chicken Tikka Masala is to die for, too! Also, (no exaggeration) the Gulab Jamun is the BEST I've ever had. No other restaurant even comes close to how theirs tastes. I will ALWAYS choose Nandini over any Indian place in Arizona!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch with a Groupon.  We ate off of the regular menu (instead of the lunch buffet so we could use the Groupon).  Everything was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  The waiter was wonderful, attentive and brought us a bit of an appetizer and dessert (on the house).  The prices are right on.  The daily (yes, even weekends) lunch buffet looked very substantial and yummy.  It is only $6.99---I can't wait to come back and try it.  Spread the word---you have to visit Nandini if you are into Indian food."}
{"text":"This was our second, but certainly not our last, visit to Nandini's. We ordered lamb biryani and lamb korma. Both were perfectly spiced and seasoned. The lamb was fork tender. Don't forget to order the naan - garlic and regular. Large portions and loved the leftovers. Oh! Did we mention the mango lassi?"}
{"text":"Food was great as was their portions. Especially if you go in a group. It's easy to share between people great for family and friends."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Came here for dinner, that maybe the reason for my experience. Their medium spicy was way over spicy. Had stomach churns that night. DO NOT GO HERE FOR DINNER."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times and each time the food is delicious, the service is great, and it's the best Indian food in the area. Highly recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! The best, freshest, most delicious Indian food in Tempe! Service is always friendly, you can tell they are proud of their food."}
{"text":"I went to this resturant after I read yelp reviews! I mean seriously this resturant got almost 5 stars ! I ordered lamb biryani and nano bread and some appetizers, the nano is ok, the lamb biryani was terrible, it tasted like it was cooked one week ago, and was warmed up 10 times. The staff are friendly though."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in the Valley! The staff was so sweet and helpful in describing the different spice levels! We had the chicken vindaloo and the lamb tikka masala, it was heavenly! My tummy was full and i couldnt stop eating! We also got some vegetable samosa and the garlic naan! Everything was perfect! You have earned a long time customer in me Nandini ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I usually go to a place in Tracy but this one was a little closer for me and the food was pretty good. I got the chicken curry and saag and ordered them spicy they came out pretty good. Just wished it was a little spicier by over all it was a pleasant experience!!"}
{"text":"I work a lot and travelled around the world to Paris and London to name a few.. I decided to treat myself to dinner on this Sunday evening and had a craving for some authentic and traditional Indian Cuisine...the last time I went to one was in London. First walking in the restaurant, I noticed it had a nice layout with their statues including camels and beautiful pictures of Indian traditional dance & clothing then traditional cultural music in background. I've been a restaurant critic for years and I'm very picky. The menu had a nice selection , the prices seem a bit high but I have class and figured there was a reason behind it so I ordered Lamb Saag with choice of spicy(creamed spinach dish) with Garlic Naan bread and Indian Chai Tea. The Lamb was cooked perfectly, nice and soft and the spices was delicious with the spinach being perfect in creaminess. The garlic Naan bread was moist enough and not dry with perfect amount of garlic used to blend in with the bread. The chai tea was good. I spent about $28 before tip yet the portions were quite large, good enough for two people.. Luckily I only ate small breakfast earlier today so I was able to finish most of my food..everything was delicious and perfect ..texture, spice, and even the rice was perfect..Oh.. Fyi this is the first restaurant I been to where I didn't complain about the water..the water was fresh, filtered,clean, and cold. This restaurant's dishes was worth every penny and more, so I'm giving it 5 stars..it was just as nice if not better than the one in upscale London..and definitely better than the ones here in AZ I went to so far.  The service was good too. My only recommendations if they were ever to ask is it would be a bonus for traditional outfits to be worn for the waiter/waitresses serving us and to be able to purchase wine and beer imported from India..wanted to get Indian bottle of wine for my visiting partner (who is a big fan of Indian Cuisine) when he visits here from London during the holidays..We're definitely going here together soon."}
{"text":"I went during the lunch buffet, and that was around $12-$13 for it. The food was good; there were some curries that tasted a bit too salty, but it was delicious nonetheless! The only complaints I have was the fact that our waiter accidentally spilled an ice cube into my friend's plate, but other than an apology, didn't really do anything, like offer to take away the plate. Moreover, the naan was really good! We have suspicions though that one waiter actually brought us the leftover naan from a different table after those guests had left."}
{"text":"I try there buffet on weekday not impressed by the quality of the food & taste. The reason I'm giving three star is a very nice owner, clean location and good service, but the food was pricey and out classed by other near by Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"This place has a new name and had a bit of a facelift on the interior (it's less drab and they actually let some light in through the windows), but the food is the same as when it was Royal Taj.... nothing too special. I came with a friend today for the lunch buffet (points for having the lunch buffet on the weekend). The buffet is decently sized, but doesn't have a good variety of meats (no lamb or goat... boo). None of the food was all that tasty, the tikka masala was kind of bland, the chicken vindaloo was slightly spicy, but the chicken was not high quality (connective tissue and all that jazz). It was nice that they had chai and mango lassi available as part of the buffet, but both were fairly bland as well... this place needs to spice their food up significantly. The redeeming quality was that it was fairly cheap (7$ for the buffet), but I still wouldn't go back because it just wasn't up to par with other Indian buffets in town, regardless of price."}
{"text":"Fantastic food - perfectly spiced paneer and chicken tika masala. Excellent naan and paratha.
Service was friendly, prompt and efficient. Prices were extremely reasonable - portions nicely sized.
Hopefully beer and wine will be coming soon! We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Downgrading my initial review substantially.  They were not prepared to effectively accommodate take out orders on the phone (person answering the phone was unaware of whether or not she was capable of taking orders, and settled on not), OR when I arrived.  The restaurant was empty again, I suspect there is a reason.  They got my 2-item order 50% wrong and 100% unsatisfying - \"Aloo mutter\" is apparently potatoes and peas in the same curry sauce as Vegetable Korma.  NO.  The \"Vegetables\" in the Korma itself consisted a tiny handful of chopped cauliflower and 10 peas, and 2 shreds of red pepper.  The charge for rice wasn't new, but worsened my overall impression.

The semi grumpy old man standing at the bar reading the menu, wearing embarrassingly ill fitting clothes, and failing to acknowledge the customer in any way, was also completely unwilling or unable to assist the order process - and clearly it was in need of help.  

Sad to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday dinner here with the family. Vegetable samosas = yummy. Crispy pastry crust really was crispy. My Mutter Paneer was delicious - and the Lamb Korma was lovely! I would definitely order any/all of those again! I love that they have a whole menu section for naan."}
{"text":"We are so lucky to have this fabulous restaurant in our neighborhood! Delicious tikka masala, paneer saag, naan and don't forget the beer. To go orders are ready in a flash and have saved me from cooking on multiple occasions. The owners and staff are incredibly courteous and the serving sizes are very generous, if you haven't been here it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Food is terrific, reasonably priced, lots of vegetarian options. Veggie eggplant dish is the bomb. Samosa chaat is really good, the sauce is terrific, lots of cilantro. Food came out quick, staff was nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The lamb vindaloo is the best in town! They are very accommodating when it comes to spiciness, so I can get my dish nice and spicy while my kids can get theirs more on the mild side.

If you haven't eaten here, you need to!"}
{"text":"This food is straight legendary. The Naan bread is soft and delicious. I got the spiciest chicken and it was so good. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian and non vegetarian curries are very tasty. Garlic naan is awesome. Service is great. They serve champagne or coke as complimentary in buffets. But deserts are very bad. I am very disappointed with deserts. Not even single desert is satisfying."}
{"text":"Had another wonderful meal at Nandini! 
Butter chicken, Palak Paneer, Lamb Vindaloo and Garlic Naan.

There's no other restaurant that does naan as well as this place. I could eat 4 to myself. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I went to the lunch buffet and thought the food was mediocre. Definitely not fresh like how everyone else said it was. The garlic naan is excellent but that was the only good thing about it. I honestly wouldn't come back... I've had Indian food and was expecting the same quality... Perhaps ordering food is better than buffet."}
{"text":"This food was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The server was super nice and the naan was perfect. Loved it and will definitely come back!!!!! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"My husband and I haven't had Indian food since moving out of NYC over a year ago. I was nervous I wouldn't find a place with food that matched our favorite place in New York. I'm so glad we came here! The food was DELICIOUS and they keep your water glass full, which I find important. We both have leftovers for tomorrow, which I already can't wait to eat. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to Nandini and was still impressed. They are friendly and have proper serving etiquette. The food is amazing! We ordered chicken curry,  chicken tikki masala, and chicken vindaloo. It was my fathers and sisters first time coming and they already said they will be back! The serving sizes are big enough to split between two people if you order garlic naan or rice."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a whim. It was pretty empty, though we did arrive a little late, and overall has a diner feel. The service is really awesome though; we were greeted right away and sat in a cozy booth. My friend did notice that the ceiling fan caused the lights above to have a strobe effect, but upon request, they turned off the fans. The food is great. I've never been much into Indian food, so when I asked for recommendations, they suggested the Chicken Tikka Masala. Now I keep thinking about going back to have it again! We also shared a garlic naan, which is also really good. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"After hearing there was some atmosphere improvements over the last place in this location I was disappointed to see the McDonald's style tile floor still there, and the booths were quite retro and old looking, but not in a good way.  My server was not Indian and had trouble with the menu names, which is a rare occurrence for an Indian restaurant.  My spirits turned around when I saw some modest prices on the menu, especially vegetable entrees.
  
However when they came out, the portions were noticeably smaller than what I normally receive.  They used the same or similar serving dishes, but the amount of potatoes, peas, and then chickpeas in the other were just not very full.  To make things worse, they entrees were nowhere near the correct spice level (way too mild) to the point where I wondered if they confused my order with someone else's.  Bread was tasty though."}
{"text":"Since moving to AZ, we've tried four or five Indian restaurants in different parts of the valley, but this is our favorite by far. Note: we've only eaten here for dinner, cannot comment on their buffet.

Their vegetable pakoras are the best I've ever had, period. After living in the Bay Area, Chicago, and NYC, this is the highest compliment I can give. Their naan (always steaming and smoldering when it comes to the table) and palak paneer are similarly exceptional. Everything comes to the table deliciously fresh. 

For some reason, the restaurant is rarely very busy when we've been. In fact, the first time we went we were the only customers. Didn't stop us from having an absolutely delicious meal! Service was great, as you might expect."}
{"text":"Did I really forget to post a note for Nandini? I hate when I do that. A+ rating for this little Indian restaurant. Clean inside, friendly staff, and uber delicious food. We could not believe how flavorful (and not too spicy) everything was. Thanks for a great first time trying out some of your wonderful dishes. And the naan bread - perfect. Can't wait to get back and try a few new items next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing.  Best Indian food and service ever.  The food is so fresh and taste great.  We found this place a month ago and we have been here 4 times now and every time we try something different and it is so good.  Sunny is our waiter who is also amazing and so friendly.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes Indian food"}
{"text":"Walked in at 5 and it Was empty. Soon after arrival people started pouring in. We ordered and our food And it  came out so fast. It was nice portion sizes, not too overwhelming or too small and tasted amazing. I recommend the tikki masala or the curry chicken. The nan bread was also fantastic. Great service, very friendly and welcoming. The owner even came out to speak with us and thank us for coming in. Truly a great Indian dinning experience. We will be back with friends or family. Thank you Nadini Indian cuisine!"}
