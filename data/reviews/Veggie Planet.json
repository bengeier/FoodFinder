{"text":"Diner style veg/vegan friendly restaurant. Tried multiple dishes, was really flavourful. Dishes were seasoned pretty much all the same. Would go again."}
{"text":"A friend of mine pointed out this restaurant to me and I decided to check it out after my workout.    A few tips when ordering here:  1. They will have things labelled \"vegan\" but may include cheese or yogurt.  What the V actually means is that they have a vegan option and you need to tell them that.    2. Ask the cashier for recommendations as they have a very large menu.    With regards to the restaurant and food itself, the location is in an industrial plaza off Dixie road.    The atmosphere is that of a casual self-serve restaurant.    What I ordered:  -Veggie (vegan) biryani: You get to tell them how spicy you want it which is good. I had it medium spicy and it wasn't too spicy at all, so it was not bad.  The taste was good, had a good helping of vegetables and it was tasty. My only complaint is that it was a bit too greasy for my liking.    -Channa Samosa Chaat - It's basically the a mini samsosa topped with chutney and curry.  It had a nice tangy taste to it.    Overall, the food was pretty good and I'd be willing to go back and prices are very reasonable as I paid just over $12 for a very good helping of food."}
{"text":"Vegan friendly Indian style cuisine. Keep in mind that when ordering vegan, you have to inform the cashier so that they will use vegan substitutes (they have a substitute for everything except yoghurt I believe). I've come here a handful of times and ordered many different things except the pizzas so far. Service is very friendly and the place is comfortable enough. The menu has lots of options and the prices are good - not too expensive for anything. I don't have much experience with spicy food although I do like Indian foods and I do ask them to make my order with mild spiciness. A couple times it still was too spicy for me to eat much of it but the food was delicious otherwise. Everything seems to be fresh. The only complaint I have is that it was too cold in the winter months inside the place, I had to keep my jacket on when I was eating. Also lack of tomato on the burger is pretty common (or one slice of way too small tomato). Otherwise, I would recommend this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"I happened by this place because of their Groupon deal.  We went here on Sunday afternoon and I am very glad we did.   Their menu is on the giant wall as you enter and everything is explained very well. This is definitely THE place to go for good vegetarian food.   We had the vada pav, dahi sev puri, pain puri, and the paneer topped pizza. I would eat all of them all over again and try even more of their food. I am definitely going back to to try nearly everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Serves good Indian food, nice flavours ! Quantity was normal as well ! Pav bhaji pizza stole the show !  A bit maintenance on the washroom would elevate the rating for this place !"}
{"text":"Good quality of food and service, veggie lovers will enjoy, many option with Indian flavor, mouth watering dahi puri, veggie pepperoni pizza, veggie burger. Veggie lovers must try this place. :)"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food, quick service. I love the vada Pao here. Its my third visit and the food quality and taste is consistent. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Authentic Indian Vegetarian Food, this is the place you should have tried yesterday, if you haven't already. A great family run place with great personable service, the vibe is very upbeat and positive. The taste is true to its roots and food is freshly made and catered to Canadian palate. The host pay peculiar attention to all their patrons and make them feel warmly welcome. It will definitely be one of my go to spots when in the SIX."}
