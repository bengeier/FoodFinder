{"text":"The best place satisfy your needs! The fried okra is genuinely the best. I order from the resturant at least 1 to 3 times a week. The owner is friendly. The atmosphere is amazing, and the food great!"}
{"text":"Very consistent food, with a wide variety to choose from. If you want a great cheeseburger or comfort food, Pete's is the place."}
{"text":"Always good service!!! Great food.and very clean..!!!Always respectable and kind!!! Nice people!!"}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick lunch or dinner! Meals are always consistent and good. Fantastic pita sandwiches and subs! There plate dinners are good but lack creativity. You can eat there for $5 at lunch if you want to which is a plus for the budget minded! Service is always very friendly and they know people by name!!"}
{"text":"Food was reasonably priced and the people are friendly.  I had grilled chicken with onions and peppers.  I am on a low carb diet and they were very accommodating.  My kids had a cheeseburger and the other had shrimp.  He loved the hush puppy's.  My husband had a chicken gyro.  Very good.  It was warm inside but they apologized for it being warm.   Not fancy at all and lacking in ambiance but nice people and good food.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Military visiting my mother who lived in Stanley, NC. Not a lot of restaurants to choose from in this city but I see why, who needs anything else when you have this place. Very simple but tasty comfort food with a home town feel. Loved every bite, was only in Stanley for a few days and ate there twice. I recommend the country fried steak or the fried pork chops. If able I will return to try more of their menu. Also the desserts on display look amazing and I would have tried but was so full after my main meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I always come here when we are in town. It is inexpensive, but most importantly delicious. The food is fresh, you can tell. The flavors all go perfectly and compliment each other; my personal favorite being the Greek chicken pita."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Everything  I try is always awesome. My favorite is the Philly steak with fries and ofcourse ranch. They have very good ranch. I would recommend  this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We have eaten there now about 5 times. Been very good. I got the flounder sandwich last night. Man was it good. Better than Shomars!!! Hands down. 
Always good."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place we have in Town. I highly recommend the philly or the grilled chicken tenders, but whatever you order will be delicious. I have no idea how they keep up because it gets very busy at lunch time, but the service is exceptionally quick and my order has been accurate every time! I love supporting a family-owned and operated business but it is even easier when they have such great food and service!"}
{"text":"Incredible food here at great price! Knew Pete in Charlotte and he's brought the same level of food and service to this new spot in Stanley. I don't get here often enough, but it is always worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! I ordered a veggie pita with gyro meat added into it (I like a lot of fixins so this offered me a bunch of added veggies rather than getting the regular gyro) and it was awesome! Meat tastes very authentic and I loooooooved the tzatziki sauce! My coworkers also ordered the chicken strips that I heard were good, as well as the pulled pork bbq sandwich.

The prices were super reasonable and the owner was super friendly, will definitely go back!"}
