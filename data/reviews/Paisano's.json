{"text":"I have been eating here for 30 years. I have NEVER had a bad order from here. You will never find a hoagie better than Mark\"s famous Italian or Steak hoagies. The pizza is amazing and is always perfect!! All of Marks toppings are 100% fresh every time. Everything is priced very low and under competitive for the quality of the food that they sell which a lot of it is homemade. Mark has his recipes and he has never changed them to my knowledge. I will continue to eat there for hopefully the next 30 years Mark, keep up the good work!!!! Parking is also tight."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from Paisano's a handful of times. The pizza is good, not my top favorite place for it, but the curly fries are so good that I usually order from here anyway. The curly fries are simple and look like whole potatoes that were just spiral cut (sometimes you get the end pieces) and briefly deep fried, but they're ridiculously good.   The guy that has always picked up the phone is extremely curt on the phone, with a lot of one word questions/replies. When I call and ask to place an order for delivery, the answer is just \"address\" then \"phone\" then \"order\" or \"what can I get you\". Not a huge deal, but don't have high expectations for niceties and politeness.   The pricing for delivery orders is a little confusing and also seems high. There seem to be separate prices for each item based on whether they're for delivery or eat in/pick up, rather than an additional flat delivery fee. My order total always seems well above the menu prices, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. They also charge an extra fee for paying with a credit card, which I have never seen a restaurant do before, and feels at least questionable when I'm making a $30+ order.   The customer service attitude and strange pricing policies definitely detract from my impression of Paisano's, but I enjoy the food so they won't stop me from continuing to order here in the future."}
{"text":"This place is insanely hit or miss so don't blame me if you dislike your order.  I will say they make a hell of a bacon cheeseburger, hand pressed and broccoli cheddar poppers I could eat all day.  They don't hold a candle to Pizza Company but in a pinch it works.  They have been here 45 years so they gotta be doing something right.  Eat at your own risk, good or bad."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time tonight. I was waiting for the bus so only had a few minutes before it arrived. The gentleman working was so accommodating and hurried my pizza and i still made the bus. However, in the case that i would have missed the bus, it would've been sooo worth it! This pizza was amazing and I'm thrilled that i discovered this little gem! You've got a customer for life! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The owner is a boisterous guy and may dole out some gentle ribbing, but the food is good and the service is fast. So far, I've tried the Italian hoagie and the both the regular and Sicilian pizzas and all were good. This place has been open since I was a little kid and is a staple in the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  Updated to add: I think the white pizza is amazing and my husband thinks the hot sausage with hot peppers is in his top five pizzas of all time. I have to agree , its pretty fantastic. So far, everything has been so good!"}
{"text":"Been going here my entire life. I love it especially the swigs he pizza. Perfect for any occasion."}
{"text":"Been eating here for over 15yrs. Reading people's reviews I realized that i only order three things regularly and should try more. Anyways my go to's here are the pizza, WHITE cheese fries, and the Italian hoagie. I LOVEEEEE the white cheese fries I'm not sure what kind of cheese I assume provolone, but its melted into the perfectly seasoned curly fries, can never go wrong with those, i just recently had them without the cheese and they are pretty good as well. I ordered from them at my job and my coworker is addicted to the pizza and white cheese fries. If you can get past the neighborhood, the look of the business, and the workers it's a really great place, because it really doesn't look the cleanest. I have been ordering from here for years so I'm used to the attitudes of the people but I do know that some people can't stand Mark lol I think it wouldn't be Paisano's without you having to argue with Mark on the phone while you're ordering your food. He has his days but other than alllll of that the food here really is great!"}
{"text":"I eat here often and would recommend the food. There is an area to sit down, but I like to get my food to go. The people who work here are friendly. Try the pizza combo sub or breadsticks"}
{"text":"The delivery was fast, the pizza was soft and gooey, and the wings were ubercrisp yet moist. What else ya wanna know? :) Order!"}
{"text":"Called in for delivery and ordered a larger pepperoni with 12 hot wings.  Being rather brash myself, the guy on the phone sounded rather meek and hospitable.  The pizza was delivered in no time and was piping hot as were the wings.  The crust on the pizza was a little yeasty and a tad over-proofed, but it had decent flavor.  There was a little grease on it, but it had pepperoni on it.  I have NEVER had a pepperoni pizza that was not a little greasy.    I didn't get to eat the wings right away, but even though they were cold when I got to them the wings still tasted good.  Not really hot by my standards, more of a mild for me; but it may be too much for the regular Pittsburgher.  I will definitely be ordering from here again.  Feeding three people, it was much less than $10 per person with enough left for a fourth person."}
{"text":"For deliver in pizza in the Arlington/Mt. Oliver/Allentown area, this is as good as it gets.  Seriously good Pizza and reasonable delivery times.  They also make an item called the Spinach Roll that is the size of a calzone/stromboli and is filled with spinach and white cheeses that is delicious.  Their sweet and spicy wings are worth trying too."}
{"text":"Had a small Italian hoagie and 4 cut pie.  Price was good, food was ready in no time. I was looking forward to hearing from Mark (the guy I was warned about) but apparently it was past his bedtime. The pizza was what you would expect. Four cuts half pepperoni half extra cheese. The hoagie I asked for well done with what it normally comes with. From what I understand Mark makes the dressing himself.  It's pretty good. Service was the nicest part of Paisano's very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"This will be the third time I have ordered from them. The food is good however, every time I have called I have felt like I am bothering them (in all situations I have spoken to both a male and a female). They need to slow down and engage the customer at hand, not the call they may have on hold or the customers they may have in store. This is enough to keep me from ordering again."}
{"text":"If you want attitude when you order your pizza, this is the place to go. Cheap prices in a questionable neighborhood for the greasiest pizza I've had in a long time. But it's definitely cheap and I can walk there. The star attraction at Paisano's is the man who works behind the counter. He grilled my group on our origins - we clearly aren't Pittsburgh natives. We didn't take it personally because he heckled everyone who stopped by. In Allentown, you meet some interesting characters, and this guy is one of them.   So if you're craving a big greasy pizza, head over to Paisano's with your tough skin intact."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and really wanted to try this place. I called and the woman that answered the phone gave me an immediate attitude. I hung up because I refuse to service a place with poor customer service skills."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here several times and the food is consistently decent and fairly priced. The delivery has always been nicely timed, too.  I live close by and was out for a walk one day and decided to try dining in there. That was a mistake. The place is filthy, really, just gross. I wish I hadn't gone in there. It's the best tasting pizza delivered to Mount Washington. If I can forget about how dirty the shop is, I will order from there again.... Delivered"}
{"text":"The Italian,steak and meatball hoagies are yummy to your tummy.Their pepperoni and sausage pizza cooked well done...Yes,I said cooked well done..Nobody likes doughy pizza right?It's delish..This little hidden gem is a must try"}
{"text":"Kay wasn't feeling much like Julia Childs or Danica Patrick this evening, so to the internet we looked for (a) A pizza parlor that would deliver to Beechview. (b) A pizza parlor we hadn't tried yet.  Alas! There was Paisano's! The middling first review almost deterred us, but in trying Paisano's, we found that a \"tough skin\" was not required. In actuality, Paisano's is a bit of a softie, from the lady that answered the phone to take down my order to the pie itself.   Doughy and malleable, the cushy crust was the clear high point to our sausage-only pizza (Kay surprisingly detoured from the Kay Kombo this evening). \"Greasy\" this pizza was not. The cheese itself was dairy divinity incarnate, and the sausage approached the correct balance of crispness and succulence. I would have liked to have been able to detect more of the pasty sauce, however.   Conversely, the dozen garlic wings we also ordered were brittle, fatty, and thus almost foolproof.  The delivery time took less that 20 minutes. Top. That.   No one heckled us, either.   Us paisanos eat pretty well, don't we?   I just learned that \"paisano\" is Italian for \"peasant.\"  I aimz ta educate yinz when possible.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gvsgwmAfdU"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast and the pizza was great. If you're going to order pick up just know that there isn't a lot of parking. Other than that, the place was great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"They have a to die for seafood supreme pie. Italian n steak hoagies, Pizza, fries all wonderful. We Order often. Mark can be unpleasant on days, but he has good food and he knows it. The public can be difficult to deal with and I'm sure he had his share in the neighborhood. He gets buisness. 30 years ago I used to hate calling n would make my husband because I love the pie so much. Now I don't care we've come to expect it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately terrible service. Would be one star if the pizza was worse but the product isn't bad."}
