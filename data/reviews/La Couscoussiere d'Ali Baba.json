{"text":"This quiet hole-in-the-wall place was so quiet when we got there. We were the only customers in the restaurant. However, that's not surprising for a Wednesday night. All of my doubts were settled when we got our food. Delicious and authentic. It was quiet but it allowed us to really enjoy the food without distractions! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"PROS:  1. The decor is a sight to see. Very crafty inside with lanterns, cloth and warm lighting. The belly dancers were fun to watch and involved audience members (particularly birthday people).   2. It's BYOW! Definitely take advantage and get ready to dance!!  CONS:  1. The food took FOREVER to come out. I think till the third dancer and we ended up staying at the restaurant eating after all the entertainment was done and most of the other diners left. Not good.  2. The food was oookkaayyyy. I wasn't so impressed or disappointed, just meh. I would only go here for the belly dancers and decor of the resto. I had the lamb tagine which was quite dry. Also, the lighting was really dark so it was hard to see what I was eating.   3. There were only 2 bathrooms for the entire restaurant (ie., 2 toilets). So there were big line-ups during intermissions.   OVERALL: -It's a fun, relaxed place to go for a birthday celebration.  -Be prepared to dance ;) -Something I'd only do once. I'd recommend it to a friend for a bday dinner before a night out."}
