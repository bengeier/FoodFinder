{"text":"Tried for the first time. Staff is so nice. Got a chow mein combo with an egg role for $9.50. It was so good! I cannot wait to run into these guys again!"}
{"text":"I don't usually go back for seconds but the Mein Man's Crab Rangoon a.k.a. crab puffs were so good I had to have some more of them light fresh and delicious. The lo mein I ordered was a little bit under sauced but a request for some additional sauce fixed that and it was the best lo mein I think I've ever had.  Freshly made it was like the difference between fresh pasta and the stuff out of a box. Gourmet food truck is usually a joke but this one really is.  Even if you're not hungry if you see this truck stop and get a to go and eat it later you'll be thanking me."}
{"text":"They just came to our apt. Complex today. And the food was AMAZING!! Best crab puffs I've ever had! My husband got the sister sauce it was so good! MUST TRY"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food!! The salad was delicious and the customer service was awesome! Def recommend! The prices are great and the food was great quality and made to order! I'm a good snob and I give them 5 stars because they have healthier options that taste fantastic!"}
{"text":"First of all the prices were amazing! Most affordable food truck that I've seen and the portion is definitely a big one. My husband each ordered a bowl and I easily had leftovers for lunch the next day. 

I had the chow mein sauce with veggies and chicken. Very well made and very flavorful. I had enough sauce for my meal and the noodles were cooked to the perfect consistency. 

I felt like the portion of chicken was spot on especially because there's also plenty of veggies to offer a satisfying meal. 

My husband had beef, veggies and the curry sauce (which I got to taste). I'm not a curry fan but this sauce was not as potent as a curry but still carried the turmeric flavor. And the spice level was spot on! 

We also ordered egg rolls, dumplings and Crab puffs. All were yummy and only 75Â¢! My favorite was the crab puff. With a super crispy wonton exterior and a warm sweet crab concoction. Delish! 

The truck was very busy when we arrived and there was a line but the service was very fast and they were very friendly. We also had placed a big order and they got everything on our order correct which made us an extremely happy customers. 

I would highly recommend this place!"}
