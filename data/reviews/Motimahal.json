{"text":"Picked up a few samosas to go. It was nice of them to throw in free sauces ( Mint , tamarind?) Any how....  YAY- for the Samosas Nay -for the sauces with food color in it"}
{"text":"I have a thing for fast-food style Indian eateries, so I loooove the McDhaba decor.  This place has been around for as long as I can remember, but I only started going here recently.  The thali items are quite ok, but not outstanding.  I usually go for the thali just because I am usually hungry.  The mattar paneer is probably a safe bet to choose as a thali item.  Some of the items, like the bhindi (okra) dish I guess are less popular and they heat them up in the microwave.  One thing I have had here that is pretty special are the mirchi pakoras (a large chili pepper, breaded and fried), which come with their lovely tamarind and mint dipping sauces.  I used to eat these all the time as street food when I was in Karnataka, so it brings back good memories.  I guess the fact that the mirchi pakora is 1.50$ also adds to its attraction."}
{"text":"I like three item in this restaurant... Dal Makhani.. which is lentils with butter and species, malai kofta... and butter chicken.. just amazing... must try if you go there.  you can have this with naan or other indian bread....."}
{"text":"Great food ! But having to wait 15 minutes for a garlic naan?? The place wasn't even busy !!"}
{"text":"For a good pani puri or chaat papri, and excellent thalis, this is the place to go. There isn't really any ambiance to speak of, the seating leaves something to be desired, and you clear your own table (often for the people before you too, since they don't always clean it!) but... the food is A-mazing, as is evidenced by the number of Indo-Canadians constantly packing this restaurant. The pricing can't be beat for food this good - thalis are less than $10 each.  The staff is a bit taciturn, but they are highly efficient, and you can get thalis packed up to-go. Really, for excellent food, what more do you need?!"}
{"text":"Such a poor foods. Do not even try to go for it. It is hard to believe this kind of foods even available on gerrard street in Toronto. Such a bad taste of food & not even feels like is Indian food."}
{"text":"Some of the best indian food in the city! I'd recommend take out rather than 'dining' in because, as other reviewers have mentioned, this place is a bit grungy and more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. But the food is super - spicy, not greasy - and the price is good.   We had veggie kofta, butter chicken, goat curry, Aloo gobhi, and channa. The sauces were particularly fantastic. Aloo gobhi was just fine. Channa was super nicely spiced.   I meant to check out the bathroom so I could comment, but forgot. Next time."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout via justeat. This hands down is the best Indian food I've had. Naan and pakora servings are huge. Butter chicken, mixed veg curry, and muteer paneer were all delicious"}
{"text":"Call and pick up your food within 5-10 minutes and its excellent quality. It's not the best in Little India, but its so convenient and well-priced, you just can't go wrong.   Chicken Tikka and Naan $7. Wow."}
{"text":"Been going here for the past year. Service is good only when you get the female or the  owner. The other guys don't know what they are doing. I called ahead for my order. I was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes. 35 minutes later I'm served cold curry and asked to heat it up myself at home.  I'm never going back again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a young lad of about 8 years old! I've grown up on this restaurant's Malai Kofta (vegetable balls in the same high quality sauce as butter chicken), Mattar Paneer (green peas with \"Indian cheese\") and Choley (spicy chick peas). So much so that to this day, my all-time favorite dish is still Malai Kofta! I've tried making it at home but haven't quite perfected the art yet to the Malai Kofta Quality at Motimahal. I've yet to find another Indian restaurant make that dish as good, though some have come close. Note that my family and I are vegetarian so we haven't tried amy of the meat dishes.  When we go to this restaurant lately, we also order a plate of \"dahi bhalla\" (yogurt with fried balls) though we tell them to hold the green spicy sauce on top (and use it to counteract some of the spiciness of other dishes).   For dessert, we go with the family favorite \"Ras Malai\" which is a sort of rich cheesecake (no crust) in sweetened milk\". You've gotta try that too!   We absolutely love this restaurant. We love the food, the low prices and the friendly staff. Try it out - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"For the price, the food is pretty good and the portion size is great as well. The place is cleaner than most of the places in the area. Be careful what you order though, not everything in the menu is finger-licking-good. My friend ordered puri and the pea vegetable was tasteless, but the paneer and naan that I ordered was quiet delicious."}
{"text":"The food was here was only decent.  Maybe it's more authentic, but I have personally had much better Indian food in Toronto and most other places for that matter.  The wait was very long, which was strange given that most of the food is prepared ahead of time.  Part of the problem is that the prepared food is sitting in front and gets cold.  So part of the \"preparation\" is one guy putting each of the food items into a *single* microwave one at a time.  Yes, a microwave.  Yes, one at a time.  Suffice it to say, we won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me, and boy was that person right. Don't be deterred by the outside appearance because it looks like a fast food joint. And affordability doesn't mean you're skimping on quality either!!! The chicken curry is delicious, the potatoes are divine, and do not get me started on the garlic naan--top 3 best I ever had. There are lots of options in Little India, so save yourself the anxiety and go here!"}
{"text":"Yes this place is proof that whole in the wall places often have food that will make you forget the surroundings. I have been going this place on and off for at least 30 years  and believe me it hasn't changed a bit. The food is still very good and served quickly . The curries are pre cooked but Naan and roti are made to order. My favourite is the goat naan kabob. It comes with 2 large kabobs steaming fresh hot naan and an excellent mint chutney. The goat is tender and seasoned perfectly. I would guess that some who do not even like goat may be converted. The sweets are also very good. My favourites are the patisa which is a type of barfi and the ras malai."}
{"text":"Food is 4 stars, restaurant itself is more like a 1 or 2.  This is a diner-style Indian restaurant with small booths to sit in.  You line up to order and pay for your food and they'll call your number when it's ready.  Today there was a bucket collecting dripping water from the AC unit in the line as well.    Not fine dining BUT: The food is delicious and great value.  They have great combo platters, the samosas excellent and tasty tasty naan.  Today we ordered small sizes of butter chicken, chicken tikka, beef curry and saag paneer.  With that got two veg samosas, 2 garlic naan and rice.  All this food for $40.  Will probably provide leftovers for two more meals."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Motimahal a lot and it's always been great, but last night I ordered my usual Paneer Tikka and found chunks of chicken in it. I am a vegetarian, and I was extremely grossed out by this. I am really disappointed and I don't know if I will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Ordered from them for the first time tonight.  Delivered in less than an hour, I was quite happy to get something new.  I was highly impressed.  Goat Karahi, Pulao Rice, Butter Chicken and Alu Jeera so far.  Impressed.  I chase Indian food all around the world.  It's normal to be in a horrible location and get stupendous food.  An excellent place only charges more for what could be terrible food.  I've learned that I should never judge an Indian resto from its environment.    I will be ordering from them in the future."}
{"text":"I like to visit this place frequently. However, it is only good for certain dishes. I LOVE the chana poori! It's the best chana poori i have ever had. I also love the paneer tikka and the chaat papri -- delicious!! Their mango shakes are pretty tasty as well.   It is not the cleanest place, in terms of the seating area, but it it great for a quick bite and tastes good too!  Their chicken tikka and naan would be great, if they used better pieces of chicken.   Their paneer tikka and naan is delicious! I love their tikka sauce.   Their vegetarian thali is alright, definitely not the best I've had."}
{"text":"I went here about a year ago with Kate M. and we had a marvellous time. Yesterday, it hit me- an intense desire to return. So I brought along my BF and we made a far east movement to Motimahal.   We ordered two meat thali's and (spoiler alert!) it was way more than I needed, perfect for him. The system is that you order, get a number, wait for the rice, naan, etc. to get prepped, number is called and then you head back up to the front to make some selections. I opted for the butter chicken, saag paneer and a pea-paneer dish. Along comes the rice, naan bread and a little onion and pickled beet salad  Maybe because this time I hadn't trekked in rain, on foot for an hour prior to eating, but I didn't find it as satisfying as last year. The butter chicken has a nice smokiness to it but the cut of chicken, full of bones was a bit distracting. The saag panner was my least favourite, kinda bland. But the favourite was the pea and paneer dish! I also enjoyed the daring onion and beet salad with it's minty dressing. The naan was great and I loved the addition of black sesame seeds sprinkled on top.   It's a funny, fast-food, Indian place that fills you up! A bit hit and miss, but with enough hits at a low, low price to make me come back."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I just loved it !  Amazing food at reasonable prices with good portions"}
{"text":"Motimahal is my go-to place for Indian snacks and sweets whenever I am in Little Indian.  I brought the SO here on Saturday for some sweet eats after our meal a few store down.  We got a Ras Mali (sp?) and Gulab Jamun to share.  The size of the Gulab Jamun was jumbo timbit on crack, it was soo good and filled with sugary goodness.  Their Ras Mali is descent as well, wonderful milk syrup.  I would also recommend trying their chats and naans, all fresh and tasty.  Their prices are very affordable.  Note: do not expect fancy decor, this place is a bit divey but the food makes up for everything."}
{"text":"love the nann and chicken tandori!! so good! but they need to make the place cleaner"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant in the area. I am visiting it intermittently since 1998. The pricing is very high for self serve style of restaurant. Since I visit alone I felt this is best choice but worst experience every time. Recently they started adding hot sauce to curries while cooking to attract customers which is very dangerous for health though tastes spicy. This is not traditional style of cooking Indian curries. This is the only Indian restaurant in this area that has self serve to dine in like McDonalds or KFC type of fast food restaurants. Probably that attracts some customers who do not want to pay tips to waiters in other restaurants around. Quality is very low. I just bought one small Bhendi and aloo fry at almost their closing time of 9:55 PM, they charged $6/- plus 13% tax that came to $6.80/-, it looked warm and almost no taste, I took half of it and left remaining half, the early morning I smell it stale and I had to throw away. But surprisingly I see large number of customers, apparently most of them Punjabis or Punjabi Muslims. This restaurant is a enigma, I still could not understand what drives customers to get there. Though management keeps rising rates every year there is no improvement in facilities, same dining area and congested food ordering area. Many times I came out because I could not stand there due to people moving around.You have to stand up in line to order, they give a token and you have to collect food when token number is displayed. It is like taking food like in food rationing communist countries. Due to the 3 factors above it is not worth your price. One vegetarian plate is probably above $12/- for that style of restaurant, you may get better choices, with nice ambience for the same price in the adjacent Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  We heard a lot about the Chhole Bhature at this restaurant and were disappointed. We tried the desserts(Rasgulla and cup kulfi) and they were both okay. Won't visit them to eat the same dishes.  May give another try for their Meat Thai or their desserts as there are some good reviews, but I'm not in a rush to head back."}
{"text":"Had the street food yesterday - bhel puri and sev puri here (take out) and once we got back into the car.. I couldn't believe how salty it was! I'm all for Indian street food (heck, I'm Indian), but man they really put so much salt! All I tasted was salt and the tamarind. I chugged A LOT of water once I ate half the small container.  Price wise - it came up to around $15 for two street \"chaats\" and one mango laasi.  Wish it wasn't disappointing, I'm sad to say it was. I would only visit if I was craving Indian street \"chaat\"/food."}
{"text":"My go to place for Indian food in Toronto. The veggie thali never fails! The ambiance is very minimal but that just means the diner is more focused in the food...for good reason! I recommend the naan with veggie thali and extra orders of malai kofta. Their malai kofta is best in the GTA hands down."}
{"text":"Delicious indian desserts. One sweet and sticky cutlas was $1.50, while a meat thali was $10. The butter chicken, naan, and rice in the thali are decent. However, the saag paneer and chickpeas are overly salty, to the point where I couldn't finish them. I'd come back for the sweets, but maybe avoid the hot food."}
{"text":"I went for some good Indian food. But this was not the right place. I thought of trying this place for a change and it turned out to be a wrong decision. The food was not on par with any other restaurants I have dined-in before. After waiting for almost 20 mins  our food was ready. The Naan was dipping oil and the curries were filled with strange spices. If you are really hungry and want some real Indian food, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Yes Moti Mahal BOOYAH. This venue is one of the best Indian restaurants in the city and arguably home to the best butter chicken. There has been a long debate over who has better butter chicken, Moti Mahal or Lahore Tikka House. My vote remains with Lahore but I believe the majority will and have sided with Moti Mahal. Having said that it's necessary to accept they're both magical in their own way.   With tons of Indian appetizers, mains, drinks and sweets, Moti Mahal is a one stop shop for all your needs. My favourite vegetarian dishes are the Malai Kofta, Saag Paneer, and the Choley Bhature. Meat dishes include the legendary Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala and Keema to name a few. They do offer kebabs but they can't hold a candle to Lahore's across the road, so I don't usually bother.   The décor is very old and tacky, but I could care less. The food is delicious and as cheap as it could be.  Ideal Order for 4 Choley Bhature Saag Paneer Butter Chicken Chicken Tikka Limca (Indian lime drink) Garlic Naan"}
{"text":"Picked up some takeout and it was delicious with generous portions to boot. Hilarious McDonald's style decor."}
{"text":"It took me a while to get to this place.  I live far away from Little India, and had an impulse craving for something different.  After a quick online check of what's in the area I decided on something that sounded authentic.  After a 45min rainy commute I hop off the streetcar amongst the jewelry shops and flamboyant dress stores that make up this part of town.  This restaurant has an insanely gaudy neon light fixture out front.  I think I like it.  It lets me know where to take anchor in the dense fog of hunger in which I find myself.  Upon entering I realize this is not your high-brow upscale establishment, but that's beside the point.  I'm here for the food, and from the way things look, it's going to be affordable.  And it is.  On the right wall there are pictures of many different dishes that I presume are Indian in origin.  I have no idea because I am blissfully uneducated in Asian food.  The menu above the back counter lists many chicken, vegetarian, and combo dishes.  I am equally at a loss here, not knowing what any of this stuff is.  I ask the guy behind the counter what he recommends.  He says the dinner combo.  I say Ok!  This consists of my choice of 1 meat  portion and 3 veggie portions and it will be about 15 minutes.  I order a bottle of Labatt while I'm waiting.  I walk back to the seating area to drink up and pass a bizarre assortment of deserts behind a glass counter.  Lots of different colours, and a bin of what resemble burnt cashews.  I'll bet those taste great (no sarcasm! really!).  The seats and tables are made of plastic.  That kind of plastic that a kid's backyard furniture might be made of.  I plop down on one of the benches and the table nearly falls off its pedestal.  Oh yes, I've come to the right place.  Sitting there waiting for my order, I leaf through the menu between glances of hooded, rain-soaked pedestrians through the bright neon-framed windows.  The music is what the Top 40 must be in India right now or maybe the best of '95.  It makes me feel like a white curry-eating gangster.  The best part was when the music skipped, became distorted while skipping, and eventually stopped altogether.  The realness was almost too much.  I go back to the counter to give back my empty and the guy has a plate just for me ready to go. What great timing! I just have to chose my meat and vegetable options from the trays behind the counter.  That being the case, why did I have to wait 15 minutes for the order?  Oh well.  I pick the chicken curry, spinach paste, and lentils.  Walking to the utensil stand I see nothing but spoons.  How am I going to eat chunks of chicken without a fork?    Seated once again I begin devouring the many delectable flavours before me.  Sometimes this is awkward with only a spoon. Everything is great.  I could not stop ripping apart the naan and dipping it into the chicken's curry bath.  The chicken was extra tender by the way.  The vegetables on the top right of the plate consisted of onions, cucumber, and pickled...something, covered in a delicious green slime.  I found myself dipping the naan into this green slime as well.  Great stuff indeed.  My conclusion and summary of Motimahal is that this is not a white-collar dining establishment where you are to wait to be seated.  Nor are you expected to wear dress shoes and a jacket.  I hesitate to use the term 'fast food' because fast food implies that the food is garbage, and that couldn't be further from the truth here. This is affordable, authentic Indian food.  Maybe even the best I've ever had.  I will be back because there is so much left on that menu waiting to be demolished while listening to the best skipping rap tracks this side of Mumbai."}
{"text":"I'd do Motimahal again for take out, but the dine in option is just so busy and cramped.  The food is fabulous that Bathura is light and flaky-- perfect for sopping up some spicy Channa Masala. Samosas are perfect and the Thali option is fab if you want to try a bit of everything. The butter chicken is delicious, too.  Prices are cheaper than most other places on the street, but the environment sort of kills it for me. For take out: 4 stars. Dine in: 3."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD. We went in for Deserts and they are just Outstanding. The RasMalai and Kulfi Falooda are to die for. We were so extremely tempted by the food coming out of the kitchen - the pudina parantha; will have to go there again for lunch today!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian food my husband and I have ever had. Very authentic spices and amazing flavor. Super cheap as well. The staff are really nice. It's a bit of a dive, but well worth it! My husband and I are from out of town and look forward to coming whenever we travel to Toronto. Def check this place out!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  The only reason this place gets two instead one star is because the price was pretty good and the food was ready for pick up pretty fast. Otherwise the food is terrible. Nothing tastes like it should. Everything is loaded with salt and there were so many onions in the tikka that it pretty much all tasted like a salty gross onion. It's a fast food McDonald's like Indian restaurant with plastic tables and everything is already premade in a buffet type arrangement."}
{"text":"I would give this place a higher rating but their service is annoying and frustrating. They get your order wrong, are inconsistent and outright rude. Still the best chicken biryani I ever had though"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a couple months ago for a fast lunch with a friend when I was in the area. It was my first time having Indian food and it was a great experience to try it for the first time here. This place is casual and unpretentious; similar to a diner/fast-food place. It's a good place to grab a bite and hang out with friends. The food was very authentic and fresh; and service is fast. I would recommend this place & come again!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food! Quality and quantity of food is amazing! Would definitely be going there again! But I have been there before and the food this time wasn't as great as I went last time. My fiancé did tell them the food wasn't top notch as usual and he is a regular at Moti Mahal!"}
{"text":"We had the Pani Puri plate which was $5.00 and some mithai sweets for which were pretty great. Portion of pani puris was pretty low for the price. Tamarind chutney was on point, however the coriander chutney extremely watery. Prices have gone up significantly I notice than years back when I was here with family.   Gerrard Street East has significantly changed and not for the better. Ages ago it was so lively! Indian music playing on street corners, almost half a dozen vendors grilling corn on the sidewalks. I saw a pub and a Hakka Chinese place tonight that have set up shop, on the street full of Indian restaurants it's very out of place. Good news, Lahore was filled to the masses at least."}
{"text":"Came here for our last lunch before leaving Toronto. Had always heard about famous Gerrard Street so wanted to try a place from there. Ordered a lot of vegi dishes. Everything was really solid but the paneer tikkah wrap was outstanding. MIght be one of the best wraps I've eaten. Service was decently fast. The place is complete dive but serves really solid food. Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best North Indian food in Toronto, as simple as that. Don't waste your time going to overpriced restaurants, just come here and eat your heart out.  The chole bature (fried dough with chickpea and potato curries) - a favorite comfort food of all Indians - rivals that in Delhi. The pudina paratha (mint bread) is also delicious and hot out of the oven. Pair that with some shahi paneer and you have yourself a perfect Indian meal.  If you want an authentic experience, come on Sunday afternoon or evening when everyone is crowding here for an easy dinner.   Top it all of with a hot gulab jamun or a cold rasmalai, also some of the best in the city."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in Toronto, period.  Incredibly good veg and non-veg thalis, and outstanding goat seekh kababs, which go nicely with pudina parathas.  Also an amazing selection of Indian sweets."}
{"text":"Love it. The place is ugly but the food is good. It's easily bus and streetcar accessible (I could walk if I really wanted to actually) which makes me happy because my other favorite place for a veg thali is all the way in northern Etobicoke. It's like $8 for a giant plate of food. You get naan, rice, salad, and three dishes on the thali. I loooved the malai kofta. Very tender with super creamy gravy. The muttar paneer and saag were both at the good side of average. The naan was pillowy and fresh. I'm probably going to go back immediately after writing this. Craving now. The only thing I didn't like was the selection of sweets. I stopped at BJ on the way home for my fix. Oh well, nobody's perfect."}
{"text":"Last week, my friend and I ended up at Motimahal for an early Indian lunch since our breakfast destination was still closed for the holidays. We walked along Gerrard Street for a few blocks, and this seemed our best option of the restaurants already open. The inside was a bit surprising, bright red tables with retro red and white décor in the front, and a cafeteria style serving area at the back where you choose from the available foods, all served on shiny white divided platters.  I ordered the chicken biryani, a good-sized portion of chicken and vegetables mixed with rice and yoghurt on the side, a little spicy but not too much. My friend had a meat thali, which included I think 2 servings of meat, along with potatoes and vegetables and naan. Overall, a good satisfying meal, with the total bill only about $20."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews unless a place/product is really good or really bad.  I have to say that, the food at Motimahal is out of this world.  Especially if you are from Delhi or like Delhi-style food you will love this place.  We had their Paneer Tikka, and Cholle Bhature and both were great.  The \"CHOLLE\" were out of this world.  I live in the US and would consider making a trip to Toronto just for Motimahal's Cholle."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town, in my opinion.  Everything is extremely fragrant, and spicy enough to compliment the flavours whilst not burning your brains out.  Personal favorite is the malai-kofta (translates to veggie ball in beautiful creamy sauce), put it on a meat thali!  If you've never had it, you must try the poori, whole-wheat deep-fried delicious bread.  For the record, this place is a bit of a dive, the washrooms aren't nice at all, and you order up at a counter.  This should deter no one who is on a quest for beautiful, tasty ethnic food that is very affordable."}
{"text":"I've grown to believe in the magical powers of your typical hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Motimahal is such a delight. In the midst of renovating 'trendy' restaurants, its an anchor.   Get over the tacky decor, and lack of clean tables and chairs (Hundreds of people eat here a day). Go straight for the Tandoori items, my favourite being the tandoori chicken. I usually steer clear of the thali, but if you're in the mood for something greasy, by all means try it, I dare you.  If you're in the mood for a salty snack, try the Chat Papri or Bhel Puri, they're both around $5, and delish!"}
{"text":"Wandered into this place with my sister, looking for some decent indian eats.  As soon as you walk in, you get a \"fast-food\" or cafeteria type of feel.  The tables look like their were pulled out of a 1970s fast food joint.    At the counter there is a cafeteria style serving bar with all sorts of curries and dishes.  You tell the cook what you want and they serve it in individual serving containers.     Overall I think this place is like the McDonalds of the Gerrard Little India.  Cheap, fast, greasy, and gives you diarrhea 1 hour later."}
{"text":"OKAY.  heres the deal.  open the door. walk past the chipped, slightly greasy, laminate red booths, (table and chairs both), order a damn thali and a bottle of water for less than ten bucks.  go sit and wait.  talk about stuff.  feel comforted by all the indian folk eating there.  get up and get your order.  put it on the matching red cafeteria tray. grab a napkin or two, maybe a styrofoam cup for your water if you want, sit down, eat and shut up.  (actually, there is no italian mobster shouting in your ear there, but the decor and set up is as simple as it gets.)  and dont think that one thali isnt enough.  when youre done get up and try one of the fluorescent looking desserts if you dare.    if not, take a stroll outside, digest your food and pick up some other local goodies in little india.  great food. great prices."}
{"text":"Great sweets and good Nan. The food is more delicious than you'd expect! Lots of variety. The dosa's are good too!   Their Kulfi's are delicious.  Portions can be 'very big' for take-out too."}
{"text":"Don't let the \"greasy fast food\" feel of this place fool you! The food is delicious, the servings are huge. I ate there for the first time nearly four weeks ago and I can't stop thinking about it. If I lived closer, I'd be eating there a couple times a week.  Ordering can be a bit overwhelming for a newbie, but only because everything looks incredible and there are so many options. Helpful pictures of menu options on the wall aid even the most undecided diner.  We ate in the place and found it pleasantly clean and spacious. Staff kindly offered takeout boxes for our leftovers without even asking. Everyone in the place was busy eating because the food is ridiculously good.  I'll be going back many times for sure."}
{"text":"For Indian Food in Toronto, go here!  My Favourite is Fish Kathi Kebob. For some reason, it is not listed on their price board. The Vegetarian in my family love the Paneer Kathi Kebob.   In addition, I love - Chana Bhatura, Raj Kachori, Chicken and Goat Kebobs, Pudina Parantha, Pani Puri, Chat Papri, Dhahi Bhalla, Rasmalai, All Mithai.....basically everything.   Best North Indian food outside Brampton and Mississauga. Décor is not great, Indian music blares from TV, I sometimes find that enjoyable but not everytime.  August 7, 2016  I was there today and saw someone else's order of Dahi Puri. Asked and sure enough, they have it, just do not list it on the price Board (?!?). Anyhow ordered it. So this comes dunked in and filled with chutneys (sauces) and dahi (Yogurt). It is good but you gotta eat it quickly because the last few Dahi Puris started to crumble and had to be scooped up with a spoon. I like the Dahi Puri at Bombay Street Food company better.   I also had Stuffed Chicken Naan and that was pretty good too. Of course the whole thing was too much for me and now I am good for the next 7 days."}
{"text":"There are great Indian restaurants in Toronto and unfortunately this is not one of them. All the curries are too salty and not very flavourful. I had thali here twice and both times it was below average. We went to India, we love cooking it at home and we absolutely love all Indian food so it was surprising that a place we expected to like turned out not so good especially with all the 4 stars reviews."}
{"text":"My husband and I are not from Toronto and had dosa's for the first time, and they were sooo delicious. The crepe was light and flakey, and the dipping sauces were pretty tasty. This place looks like fast food joint more than a restaurant, and be ready to wait cause there are a lot of people who order from this place. I would def go there again."}
{"text":"Disappointed! I ordered a delivery which was punctual. The delivery guy was very pleasant. I ordered butter chicken, saag paneer, bhindi and a vegetable biryani. The butter chicken sauce was great (which is why I have given two stars and not one). HOWEVER, the chicken itself was bony and possibly the cheapest cut of meat I have ever had. I think I managed to get about an ounce of meat off the entire dish. Saag Paneer was tasty enough but watery. Bhindi wasn't bad but nothing to write home about.  Biryani was mediocre. I also ordered some lhassi's which were nice.  Flavours were great but portion size and quality of ingredients were poor."}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price! We couldn't finish the food that we ordered and had a decent amount of leftovers. Got the chaat papri, paneer pakoras, meat thali, and vegetarian thali.  This is a 'fast food\" restaurant. Order at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and then sit in relatively uncomfortable chairs while you eat. The food quality and portion sizes are excellent for the price."}
{"text":"Motimahal has become our go to takeout restaurant for Indian food. Every dish is always top notch. The samosas are big and delicious and I'd recommend getting some of their naan as well. I find Indian food is a great time to eat vegetarian and their veggie dishes are the best. The paneer tikka is my favourite. But only slightly behind are the malai kofta, dahl and saag paneer. All of their curries have a good level of spice and aren't completely mild and North Americanized. If you don't like spice I'd ask them if they can make it mild for you, or you might want to try somewhere else. Id say the spice level they make their food is Medium. Because of the level of spice I don't know if it would be great for kids but I highly recommend it for adults!  I've only had takeout from here but have a number of times. The samosas come with a couple chutneys (sauces) and you'll also get some pickled veg."}
{"text":"Fantastic indian food.  Nan the size of your chest.  Tikka masala has a nice, deep, mushroomy like flavor that doesn't overpower the well marinated chicken and spicy cream sauce.  Deep fried long pepper was simple and delicioso.  Rasmalai was spongey, nutty, and not too sweet.  Just how I like it.    The samosas were run of the mill and too oily but the cilantro green sauce was off the charts good.  I wish I lived close enough to ... wait, no, I love San Diego.  I wish Motimahal would relocate to San Diego!"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying I am not a foodie or difficult to impress. I love Indian and have eaten in this neighbourhood a few times.   I ordered a takeout lunch for 2 ($50). Timing was great, transaction easy. I felt the prices were a little high but figured I wouldn't be disappointed.   3 out of the 5 items we ordered were completely inedible.   There was so much salt in the pakoras, potatoes dish, and the chickpea dish that we were not able to eat it at all. It actually hurt to touch your tongue. Also the pickled veg that came along with it was also so salty.   I called the restaurant thinking they might have had a new cook and would want to know about the quality. The manager was not receptive to this info and told me that no one else complained about it today.   He flat out refused to give any type of credit toward this 'not so cheap' lunch. He offered to give a discount on the next time I ate there; which I guarantee will be never.   Completely disgusting experience."}
{"text":"This place is worthy of three stars but really no more, in my opinion.  If there is something they do well, its the kabab.  However, their tali vegetarian offerings are way, way too oily.  The last time I was in there, there were disposable plates all over the floor near the garbage container and lots of the tables had not been cleaned (not too appetizing).  I think this place has had its heyday, but not any more.  Not terrible, but not wonderful either."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. And yes.  It had been a long day. Danielle F. and I were helping Wendy H. with a video thingy. By the time things wrapped up we were staaaarving. After walking in the rain for about an hour with Danielle F (10 min the in the wrong direction), we finally found ourselves in Little India.   Yay! We made it! We're soaking wet! Our tummies are grumbling! This better be good!  And it was.   Motimahal isn't the fanciest place. Basic decor and wooden booths. Your food is given to you on a cafeteria like tray. Here it's all about amazing food at a great price. It's the best.   I got one of the plate deals that I couldn't tell you the name of with a pikora (sp?) on the side. The plate deal gives you everything, nann, a meat, two veggie, and more! Add a bottled water (not needed as they give you a jug of water, my bad) and my total was about $12.   So much delicious Indian food at so low a price! The best! Neither of us could fully finish our plates.  Will I be back? Yes. Duh. Will I walk to Little India in the rain for over an hour? Not again."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have had so far! Great chicken biryani, great chai and sweets ! So yummy !!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My bro and I were craving gulab-jamuns and rasmalai and it was recommended that we come here. Immediately when I walked in I knew it was the same chain that I loved when I lived near Scarborough. Once inside I noticed that they had a lot of dessert options, in addition to their savory display. But we wanted something sweet, so I scanned the offerings, and sadly some signs were missing, so that meant that I had to point for some items. Argh! I hate that! But the staff was really patient and professional, so it made the order process painless. And because I just had to, I ordered two samosas to go. The actual quality and taste was great, and reasonably priced. I regretted that I did not get more samosas. I am definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since I've been here, and having stopped in here for lunch one day this week, I am very sad to say I was not as impressed. I ordered the same masala dosa as I had previously and was shocked to see how very little filling was in it. On the plus side, it tasted okay, but the sides accompanying it were limited. Also it was under $8 for my lunch, so it wasn't that I spent a fortune. Still, I remember it being much better before."}
{"text":"My friends were treated terribly at Motimahal.  See below for the review from Dimitrios D.  However, I was unaware that this was the same place when other friends suggested stopping in for dessert after brunch in Little India.    We ordered chais and a few sweets ($12) and grabbed a table.  The decor doesn't make you want to linger - cold, hard plastic tables and a fast food atmosphere.  Although the place is constantly busy with lots of patrons and take out orders.  Our desserts were good.  I was never a huge fan of Indian sweets because the ones I've had in the past had a heavy dose of rose water which I liken to eating old lady perfume.  But the desserts here were lick-the-bottom-of-the-styrofoam-bowl good.  Motimahal gets a  2.5 star rating from me and I would hope that they got their act together and improved their customer service after the incident that my friends had to endure.  In a multi-cultural city like Toronto, there's no room for isolating customers based on race."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Indian food at a good price don't go here.   I tried to order butter chicken with a side of naan, but the cashier insisted that I had to order a #7 combo even though the option to order just butter chicken was on their menu...  So, I went with the #7 combo since I really didn't have a choice. The combo allows you to choose 1 meat dish and 2 veggie dishes, plus you get some rice and two pieces of naan. Well, basically all you get is naan and rice. You get one, maybe two if you're lucky, little pieces of chicken for the butter chicken. You basically get 1/4 cup of each of your meat and veggie options. So, don't expect to get full unless you want basically just have bread for dinner.   Considering all the food food is prepared already it takes a long time to actually get your order.  For another 2$, it's well worth it to go to an Indian buffet and actually get full off of meat and vegetables instead of just naan and rice."}
{"text":"This place has solid good Indian food for a great price. Very authentic, unlike crappy Lahore Tikka House down the road. The ambience here is tacky and uncomfortable (it sucks quite honestly, but I gies that's why we're paying this price). Whenever we're craving good Indian food these days, we head here. I always get 1-2 dishes to go as well, since it's really good value for money. Making it at home will probably cost me around the same amount.  Meat samosas are good, butter chicken, kadhai chicken, chicken tikka masala, biryani... everything we've ever tried really. Naan is good too. Head here for delicious reasonable food, but don't expect a fancy place. The guy who takes the order at the cash is a little confused always.  We actually ordered samosas and biryani for a pre-wedding family dinner from here, and people loved it. It was so reasonable and good. Highly recommend this place. I have a terrible dislike of Lahore Tikka House with its non-authentic, re-fried, over-priced crap. I'd come here and deal with ambience issues any day for the delicious food."}
{"text":"We ordered a variety of dishes and all of them except the bhel were mediocre. The service was good. The makhani dal didn't have much cream in it. It was a simple lentil dal without any cream and other beans. The palak in the palak paneer was not cooked thoroughly. The pakoras were very hard and had extra amounts of baking soda in it.  I wish it was a bit more appetizing."}
{"text":"Motimahal rocks, went in for a mid afternoon snack, ordered a spicy green chili pakora and a vegetable samosa. Items are made fresh while you wait; let me tell you straight up worth every second of the 8 minute wait. Chili pakora was spicy hot and excellent; the Samosa had a light flakey fried exterior dough with a nicely spiced potato/pea stuffing, this was without question some of the very best pakoras/samosas I've had. I wouldn't hesitate to return in the future as this place is just plain awesome!"}
{"text":"Channa bhatura is the best in the city. $6-$7 will get you a meal you'll barely be able to finish. Get some prasad and pakoras to take home, also. Great prices, authentic desi food"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you don't like spicy hot. Everything pre-prepared is medium spicy so we asked for Panneer Tikka and Butter Chicken made special in the back mild by request. We waited longer especially for this. But when we tasted they were both super hot spicy. Nice staff, but sorry not coming back."}
{"text":"2.5 star  This review is based on desserts at Motimahal.. and on dessert only.. So it might sounded unfair.. as we ate at 2 Indian restaurants for the evening and this is the last one that we decide to go for dessert.  Gulab Jamun, Kalakand and Kuifi not bad..but I have better...  Specially the Kuifi.. the one at Lahore Tikka is a lot better..  Seatings definitely is special.. but one good thing is this place is not too smokey and You won't smell like food when you get home!"}
{"text":"5 stars for being the best butter chicken I have had on Gerrard! Much, much better than lahore tikka house for LESS MONEY.   The butter chicken has a good level of heat, your nose will run but it doesn't overpower all the other flavours. I think they make it to order, to some degree, because it isn't on their hot plates & usually takes about 10 minutes. The chicken has always been tender and juicy. The naan is great! They give you nice big pieces.   The large ($20), with 4 orders of naan ($1.50/each) filled 4 people for about $30. Awesome.  The samoas's (chicken $1.50, vegetarian $0.80) are also delicious."}
{"text":"As seems to be typical of restaurants in Little India, Motimahal earns no points for decor - once inside it could easily be mistaken for a Mr. Sub, what with its swinging door garbage cans, red melamine booths and garish lighting. However, as you make your way to the back you'll notice a logjam of people hovering around the menu items. The menu is long but most of the food is already prepared - this is great, great Indian fast food at great value.  I ordered a vegetarian \"thali\" (a stainless steel with separate, dipped compartments for food not unlike the kind you used to eat your peas, carrots and squash puree from as an infant) for $6.95. The addition of a meat thali ($7.95), extra naan (we didn't need it) and samosas brought the total bill to $20.  The thali came with my choice of three vegetable dishes (I chose Dal Makhani, Chana Masala and Malai Kofta) with Pulao rice, naan and an onion salad with a neon green relish ladled over top. I didn't touch the onion salad but was instead focused on the Malai Kofta...mashed cheese and veggie balls in a thick tomato curry sauce and the yummy dal dish. The chana masala was OK but not tomato/tamarind-y enough for me. The sauce was green-ish instead of red or burgundy. Water is self-serve in giant steel carafes that keep it cold.   I was far too stuffed from the eating contest-esque portions but I'd be eager to try the vegetable cutlets with channa ($1.50) and mango or banana lassis ($2.50) next time. Samosas were a mere $0.70-0.85.  This would be really great for party takeout or a cheap stuffed night in.  Closed on Tuesdays; debit and credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"The food is quite nice and affordable but the service is painstakingly slow. Pain probably dries faster"}
{"text":"The curry was decent but the Naan brings the place down to 2 stars. Felt like eating pizza dough. Not sure how they could mess this up."}
{"text":"Motimahal is by far the best place in the city where you can get a no frills, cheap and fast Indian meal. Every time I come here it's a must that I order a Thali plate and Masala dosa. I then rotate between their amazing Kababs or their tandoori chicken and even when I order all of the above I never walk out of there spending over $30."}
{"text":"The place isn't much to look at, and you have to stand in line to order, but not sad:  DELICIOUS chana bhatura and chaat papri, especially for the price, and as many others have mentioned, WAY better than Lahore Tikka.  I feel like the thalis and butter chicken have already gotten a lot of love so let me give a shout out to the veggie dishes. If you've never tried it, chana bhatura is chickpeas (chana) served with the most amazing deep-fried naan/bread thing (bhatura), with a little bit of curried potato and pickled carrot. It's a huge amount of food that is absolutely full of flavour!   We also ordered a dozen veggie samosas to-go for a get together later in the evening. They were a little greasy when they were fresh, but after a few hours and crisped in the over, they were perfect! The outside was super flaky, the inside was flavorful, and the tamarind chutney was spicier than most I've had before - yum! Everyone else that tasted them was equally impressed!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. It doesn't look like much, so you won't be impressing your first date. The quality of the food though. Oh my gosh !  I was delighted the first time and every time I have returned. It usually takes about ten minutes to get my food but I can happily sip a beer while I wait. If they had a patio, I would never leave.  I am vegetarian, btw, so while I have not tried the meat options, I have been there with friends that have and we always go back."}
