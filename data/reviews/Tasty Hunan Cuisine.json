{"text":"1. The food is not as tasty as that in the PapaSpicy (????) in downtown location;

2. Almost all restaurants allow you to pay tips based on the quality of service. However, this Papaspicy branch forces customers to pay 10% service charge with an extra 13% tax on the service fee, which is really annoying;

3. They did a poor job in serving their customers."}
{"text":"So the food is good but the service needs improvement and the most inconvenient issue is they only accept cash only.  Also they automatically include a service fee of 10% but only provide service worth 1%."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening, very quiet when we went in. The decor was modern and clean. The food came out very fast - bonus as I was starving. Those were the only good points, to be honest. The service was terrible. We were given a paper menu and a pen to select our dishes. No one came to get anything for or from us for a long while. In the end, I brought the menu back up to the waitress. Throughout the entire meal, no one came to check on us once. We had to go up again and get tea for our table. When it came to paying, they told us that they only accepted cash, WeChat pay, and something else obscure. We withdrew from the ATM that was conveniently placed next to the cash register. Definitely won't be returning again."}
{"text":"I went here for the second time. This time the menu changed slightly and the seating arrangements changed. I still ordered some items I had last time and it tasted just as great. I especially liked the pork hock squares that comes with the bok choy. Highly recommend it!! 

We also ordered a duck stew this time however the duck was so dry, it didn't taste that good. I would rather recommend you the chicken stew because it's not as dry. 

The beef slices with tripe is nice too. Ordered it last time and it still tasted great this time. 

The cauliflower with chestnut is a very unique dish that's not found in a lot of Chinese cuisines but maybe it's local to the Hunan cuisine. I thought the dish was interesting though. I'm not a big fan of the dish but it's a good vegetarian option for people looking for more veggie dishes. 

Overall my rating for this restaurant didn't change. Still a 4 even though the prices went up though."}
