{"text":"Best hakka food in mississauga!  Dont let the outside fool you,  this chef always serves fresh food and the portions are very generous!  Price is right too!"}
{"text":"A nice clean hidden gem. Reasonably priced and one entree would serve 2 guests. Service that is from the heart. An improvement to the ambiance would give this place a really good feel.  The food was excellent. Ordered a Black Pepper Beef and it tasted awesome even with the steamed rice. The House Special Fried Rice and the Singapore Noodles was really good on the tastebuds. The food came fresh, warm and in less than 20 minutes.  The Restaurant is pretty ordinary but very clean and full of light. An ambience uplift will give the atmosphere place a good facelift.  The lady serving was very friendly, offered suggestions and had a very good service mindset.  Check out was equipped with Apple Pay."}
{"text":"Really good pad thai and one of the best mango salads I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place on my way home from work. Located behind the shops on the street, this place was kind of hard to find. It is a small establishment - with a seating capacity of around 25. When I got there, around 7:30pm I was the only customer. I ordered chilly chicken and the food was out quick. The portion was decent however taste and quality of food below average. There was nothing in terms of decor. The only server/waitress was on her cell phone most of the time."}
{"text":"Finally I decided to check out this Hakka Chinese restaurant yesterday , which is a hidden gem I would say ! They tasted great and they were more in quantity and for a decent price ! All foods were fresh ! I would recommend this with no doubts !"}
