{"text":"i would give zero stars! just ordered from here, took over an hour & a half to deliver. i requested no onions and no tomatoes!!!! highly allergic. i made sure to right it down on the order. everything covered in onions and tomatoes. fuck this place"}
{"text":"Only one star bcuz thats the only way i can review...but this place is a joke...apparently the business was sold and under new management guy made an excuse for everything...burgers over priced, dont look nothing like the pictures, did not honor our voucher we purchased from restaurant.com... computer prices different from what the big sign reads...overall had a disappointing experience. Will definitely not be back to this place."}
{"text":"This place is great. When you've had enough $17 burgers and other simple food in hotels and $10 domestic beers, this is the place to go. Great food, friendly staff and good prices. This place was recently purchased by a new owner who will be doing alcoholic Boba, awesome! Can't wait to try! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Clean. Fast friendly and the food was good too. I recommend the Philly Steak!!!"}
