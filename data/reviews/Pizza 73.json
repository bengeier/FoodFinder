{"text":"Best value soo much food for the price. They do a large single topping for 10 bucks i had a two topper larger for 12!!! Soo good. 

They have the best chicken wings in town, not over cooked like the pubs. 

This location is the best!"}
{"text":"I have tried a pizza from this location several times. The pizza was okay for the price but the crust was not that great. I wouldn't recommend their chicken wings though they don't have any meat on the bones lol."}
{"text":"This has more do with corporate. I placed an order on line. When order arrived found that it was not even close to what was ordered. Phoned corporate and was offered a credit for missing items less GST. Wasn't happy so talked to someone else who said would get credit for full order but for only 6 months ????. Phoned in an order and gave them info I was given and was told only get credit on original call for missing items less gst. Great way to make extra money. Guess to them the customer is always someone we can rip off. Lesson learned,check your order before you pay."}
{"text":"I usually order from the pizza 73 on old banff coach road location, who i love. When i called in this time they were closed and they said they would send food from 17 ave location. I accepted but i wish i never did. When the driver arrived he immediately started to tell me how he drove up from downtown, obviously expecting a big tip. But i proceeded to explain to him that this location is not considered downtown and that he should not beg for tips. Then he argued the point which i refused because there is a pizza 73 already downtown. Now to the cusine. The pizza sauce tasted like someone used hot water instead of sauce. It was like watery pizza. How gross is that. The chicken wings were tiny and not consistent in size with the other locations i frequent. They look like the wings someone would use when they are trying to save money. I wish there were a franchise standard and the company wouldn't allow cheapskates to operate their business however they would like. Dont order from this location thinking you will get pizza 73 quality."}

{"text":"On Dec 29 at the Just north of Calgary Alberta outlet I ordered 2 large Hawaiian, 1 large light {similar to a  Mediterranean } 1 large and 1 medium pepperoni mushroom and green pepper. Both  the pepperoni had gone bad. When I called pizza 73 back they would only offer to either deliver both pizzas {pepperoni, mushroom and green pepper}. When I told them I would NOT want another one of them they offered a$10.00 credit on another order I l was then put through to  \"customer service\" who then offered a$15.00 credit. The total order with delivery, tax and 15% tip came to $100.60. I would rate them a -10 if I could. My wife and myself have ordered 2 mediums from the Royal Oak Center in Calgary numerous times but will NEVER use Pizza 73 again."}
{"text":"Pizza 73 is great so was this location until recently each saturday when i order pizza my order is always WRONG. i specifically tell them what to do and they do the opposite. If i order 2 large pizzas i receive 1 large and 1 medium this has happened to me 6 weeks straight and each time i think to myself maybe they'll get it right this time but nope its still the same bad service."}
{"text":"This is good pizza. Lots of toppings, fluffy golden crust, rich sauce and lots of cheese. It's like the old Pizza Hut pizza, when they still cared about their customers and making a quality product.
Pizza 73 actually ask how you want the crust made and which pizza sauce you prefer. The side dishes are a good deal and although getting two 12'' pizzas (the second is \"free\") costs close to $30, it's worth it. I've never had a burnt pizza or a cold one or one missing toppings from these guys. It's a pretty decent pie...."}
{"text":"i dont know why people complain about this chain....i think its amazing for the price and the convenience of having them at every corner almost! i love their curly fries, the dips are the bomb (especially the cheddar jalapeno and dill!), their wngs are big and juicy and of course their pizza.....deep baked golden crust and always liberal with their toppings....the BBQ chicken is to die for (their bbq sauce is a mesquite smoky kind yummmm.....try them with new eyes!"}
{"text":"Delivery was less then 30 min. Pizza was perfect (ham, pepperoni, mushrooms & green pepper)"}
{"text":"It would be a 3.5 if I could, but here is what I have to say: Pizza 73 is mediocre, but its cheap, and mediocre pizza doesn't mean all their menu items are. The 4 Pak+ For example, I loved their funnel cake stix, and the giant cookie actually tasted amazing, however the pizza is bland, but the wedgies are fine. Their wings aren't bad but I can easily make better tasting ones at home. The potato wedges are pretty good but nothing thats gonna change your opinion about this place. In short, if you are hungry for pizza or some form of dessert and don't plan on spending much come here, don't dine here for quality."}

{"text":"I have never been told by a pizza place that I have to buy two pizzas.  What the hell is this world coming to.  I understand that pizza 73 is mass produced crap but seriously two pizzas or nothing?"}
{"text":"Pretty bad. I'm a tourist in Canada and didn't want to go out after a long day. I just ordered Screaming Hot Wings and a buffalo chicken pizza. 

The pizza is subpar. It's steam table cafeteria fare. The sauce was nonexistent  the toppings sparse, the cheese low quality. The wings were certainly not \"screaming hot\" and instead lacked any kind of distinct flavor at all. Very very poor."}
{"text":"Ordered a deluxe and a buffalo chicken. Wasn't expecting a lot since it was New Years Eve and we assumed they would make a tonne ahead of time, but that wasn't the case. Both pizzas were hot, fresh and had crispy crust. Lot & lots of fresh toppings, but didn't make for a soggy pizza. Would defiantly order again."}
{"text":"Solid 2.5, not great, but better than I was expecting. 2 stars for grownups, 3 or 4 stars for kids.

Pizza had a nice crust, crispy but not greasy and a touch of developed flavor. Toppings were fresher and more generous than I was expecting for the price, but were ultimately quite bland. Sauce had little flavor as well, and the cheese tasted predominately of cheddar (it seems like they are using a blend).

Value was pretty decent. $25 for two medium pizzas or one pizza and a side platter. I opted for wings and fries instead of the second pizza and was again pleasantly surprised. Curly fries were crispy (esp. for something I assume was cooked in an oven, rather than a frier) and hey...I'm a sucker for curly fries. Wings were meaty but thankfully not over-size or coated in greasy breading. Buffalo sauce was not great, but I wouldn't pass them up if the beer was cold.

I don't think I'd be in any rush to order there for myself again. But if I had a yard full of hungry 8 year olds to feed, this place would be at the top of my list.

p.s.

Unfortunately, I ordered my pizza before consulting Yelp, so I wasn't aware of the Pube-Pie possibility. Fortunately, I can report that my pizza, wings and curly fires were pube-free so hopefully they've got that sorted now (hairnet-gitch or mandatory full-body shave?)"}
{"text":"I had a HORRIBLE experience that I will NEVER, EVER go back again! The guy who took my order as I did a walk-in got the crust wrong; it was thick and not thin crust. He refused to accept that he was wrong when he took the order. I, kindly, asked him to re-make me another one since he got it wrong to begin with and who likes thick crust anyways?! He yelled and screamed at me where everyone was watching from employees to customers. Wow!! I told him that I wanted a refund and he continued screaming at me non-stop. So, I then told him I'd call the police as he was verbally abusive. I have NEVER experienced something like this. I felt frightened he would smash my car. Please go to another pizza 73 location as there are others out there. STAY AWAY!"}

I thought that was to protect the food from contamination but he was making pizza, answering the phone, and changing money.....all with the gloves on! Guess the guy didn't understand the gloves are to protect us from germs, not him. 
Never again."}
{"text":"Looking for something different for lunch, I found myself attracted by a sign that stated - 9\" inch one topping pizza for $5.99. Blessed with a bottomless stomach, I thought this was the right fit so I ordered a pepperoni pizza. What I got was an insult to my taste buds and intelligence, not sure what miffed me more. 

First of all they might as well just given me bread and sauce because this is pretty much all the pizza consisted of. At best there was one 1\" pepperoni on each slice. Some slices didn't even afford me that precious inch (envision me stroking the pepperoni slice in a Gollum voice saying \"my preciousssssss\"). They were also skimpy on the cheese. Secondly, they overcharged me for the can of pop I ordered and I had to show them, on there own menu, that the price they were telling me is not what is printed. Thirdly, the pizza just wasn't that good. In fact I couldn't finish it because the sauce tasted kind on funky, they might need to do something about that.

Yeah, I understand that times are tough and businesses have to survive. But maybe they think it might be tough to find another pizza joint in the area ;-) Geez, looks like they got me there! Epic fail! I hear Panago has good deals and pizza, will try there next time."}
{"text":"pizza took forever I called at 1031pm did not get it tell 1210am!!!! ALMOST 2 HOURS Later!!!!. By this time I'm no longer hungry and just mad!!! I call pizza 73 to cancel and they said he will be there any minute so I said okay. 9min went by he eventually called to say he's arrived. he was extremely rude and aggressive towards me because I wanted change!. he's yelling and bitching he doesn't have change to give me basically trying to get an extra tip out of me. I use to work for a pizza store delivering pizza and I know that Pizza 73 specifically adds there delivery fee/tip Into the price so anything more goes into drivers pocket. after 2hrs I think the pizza should have been free but I still paid full amount + extra tip cause he didn't have change.

I called the store and a lady picked up and she was just as rude if not ruder. I got absolutely no where with this situation. Pizza was cold. Spent more then I had to. Just an all around bad experience and delivery times and an even worse attitude problem.

It would do the store a blessing to fire all the staff and rehire some more maître employees. 

I WILL NOT BE CALLING BACK AND I WILL BE LETTING EVERYONE I KNOW ABOUT THIS HORRIBLE PIZZA PLACE!. I WILL BE PLACING A REVIEW ON EVERY WEBSITE, SOCIAL MEDIA SITE AND EVERY OTHER PLACE THAT MATTERS!."}

Over priced with rude customer service and incompetent delivery driver. This pizza can't get much worse, once in the distant past they were great, but every order I've has gotten worse and worse.

Order from any place else, every other place is so much better."}

{"text":"22/30

During a party, my brother ordered a couple of pizzas and wings from this place. Two pizzas and wings typically costs about $35, so it's convenient munchie patrol food. 

The pizza arrives in under 45 minutes and my brother digs in immediately. Halfway through his slice, he noticed a longish; wiry black hair sticking up from the crust. 


Yeah. The look on your face right now, that's the face that I make every time I retell this story. 

He promptly spits out the bite he had in his mouth and scrambles to find his phone:

Pizza 73: \"Hello, Pizza 73?\"

Brother: \"Yeah, hi, I ordered a pizza earlier and um, it's got like a pube in it.\"

P73: \"I'm sorry?\"

Bro: \"A PUBE. PUBIC HAIR. HAIR FROM YOUR--\"

P73. \"Are you sure? That's impossible.\"

Bro: \"No, man. There is definitely a PUBE IN MY PIZZA. NOT JUST ON TOP, BUT LIKE, BAKED IN THE CRUST.\"

P73: \"Okay, okay. Uh, we'll make you a new one and have it there right away.\"

Bro: \"No way, I just want my money back. This is disgusting.\"

P73: \"Um, we're going to send someone there to get your pizza then, so we can have a look at it.\"

Bro: \"I took some pictures, I can just email you guys those.\"

P73: \"No, no, we want to look at it. Someone's coming by.\"

Bro: \"Um, okay, I guess.\"

20 minutes later a delivery guy shows up and whisks the pizza away. He probably wasn't informed about what happened, because he didn't ask to look at it. 15 minutes after he leaves, Pizza 73 calls my brother up again:

P73: \"Hi, we took a look at the hair we found in your pizza and we know what the problem is!\"

Bro: \"Um... neat?\"

P73: \"See, we hand knead all of our dough for our pizza crust. What you found was not an, ahem, it wasn't a pubic hair. It's an arm hair from the guy who kneaded the dough.\"

Bro: \"So am I going to get my refund?\"

P73: \"You don't just want another pizza?\"

O_o

In short, I wound up having to make extra salsa at that party."}

{"text":"About a year ago I had had Pizza 73 delivered to our hotel whilst visiting this city for the first time. Was sooo unimpressed at that time. The pizza kinda tasted like a greasy oven mitt.
A few nights ago, we were really craving pizza and it was getting late. We ordered Pizza 73 from the little plaza right near out home (takeout only - are they all like that?) and we were pleasantly surprised with our delivery. We paid $21 plus tip for 2 x 9 inch pizzas, a veggie and a hawaiian. The pizzas were perfectly cooked and the topping were fresh. The delivery guy was peppy and very friendly. He earned his tip plus the $3.50 delivery charge - the pizza was delivered in a very timely manner. You can still tell it was a chain pizza pie (boo) and next time I will order extra pizza sauce on the side as I am a dipper. (tangy is best) 
I love the fact that they have evolved and have the multi-grain crust choice.
They close at 10pm other than Sat nights - I think they stay open until 1am on Sats.

Would order from here again!"}
{"text":"Do NOT go to Pizza 73 located on 1330 - 15 Ave SW, Calgary, AB. The customer service is absolutely horrible!! We asked about their specials, and the guy at the front simply told us 'not to annoy him'. Your best bet is to go to another location where you're actually appreciated and not pushed away. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Also, their pizza's do not look appetizing at all."}
{"text":"I greeted an employee in the seating area on arrival and he ignored me. I then placed my order at the front with a female staff member and waited.

When my order was ready, a younger male staff member plopped it on the counter and disappeared wordlessly to the back while I thanked him. I then saw that the receipt said there were olives on the pizza, which I didn't order. Checked the pizza and indeed they were on it.

The female staff member was at the front having a personal conversation on the phone in Mandarin and the other employees had run off. I had clearly checked my receipt and pizza and then I attempted to get her attention and she ignored me and carried on with her call like I wasn't there. I gave up and left.

The staff were all, without exception, extremely rude, and it was quite annoying picking all the olives off my pizza."}
{"text":"Ok. First off the jalapeno poppers had a RED PEPPER in them, no jalapeno in sight. Second off the pizza is always cold or they get the order wrong. This place is never fresh. The owner called my boyfriend stupid. This pizza 73 is a disgrace. I will never be back here again. The pizza is always really dry or really cold and they mess up 90% of the time on my order. The staff are incompetent and rude and the guy that works at the front just talks and does not listen to the customers at all. The ingredients do not taste fresh at all!"}
{"text":"Because there are a couple of other pizza places close to my house that offer a much cheaper and better pizza I am not too worried about this. I ordered the movie deal, great deal! And when I got home found the cooked tomatoes I had asked for were just big raw slices. Gross. I had even said twice on the phone that I wanted them cooked but alas that did not happen. I called customer service and she said she could give me a $2 credit? What? A $2 credit when half of the ingredients on my pizza were wrong? Ha needless to say I will not be ordered from the big pizza places anymore."}
{"text":"This place has recieved their last order from me.

First of all, Pizza 73's pizza even at the best of times isn't that great. I always find the crusts pretty dry and hard, the cheese to be a bit excessive, the saucing a little scant and the topics to be pretty lack-luster. When I DO order from Pizza 73 it's for their wings because they have the best delivery wings I've been able to find at a half decent price in the city (especially because I love their barbecue sauce).... ususally.

I've ordered from this particular location 4 times, and 3 of them have been horrible - the wing orders arrived cold, filled with the kind of 1/2 sized wings that sit at the bottom of the bag when they come in, and with so little sauce you could hardly see it, and certainly couldn't taste it AT ALL. The first time, I assumed it was a one-time mistake, so I ordered a second time; same thing. The third time I phoned (I usually order online) so that I could specifically request that the operator put a note on the order to actually \"put some f***ing sauce on my wings this time\" - that order (while still having more of the mini-wings than usual) was much better. Then the fourth time, I ordered online again, this time putting my request for \"more sauce\" in the field at the end where they ask for cooking instructions... and it came the same as the first two orders.

When I tried to get ahold of the specific store, by calling the main number, I was given the runaround and eventually told there was nothing they could do.

The one thing I will give them is that out of the 3 chains in my area (along with Dominos and Papa Johns) they had the fastest average delivery time, but with this kind of deliberate shorting and lackluster food, it's simply not enough."}
{"text":"The pizza tastes like cardboard. I do like their hot wings though, that's about it. Absolutely last choice for pizza."}
{"text":"I always compare food with the price they charge for it.. 
In such a calculation, this one has got near to 3.5 stars.. 
Though I have been a big fan of pizza hut and boston pizza, happened to try this by placing a delivery order for office while working late hours. The best thing about this was they had many varieties of pizzas unlike pizza hut. 
The price was pretty reasonable and they have always had some or other deals which makes it even cheaper with an add-ons like chicken wings or pop or other...

Pizza was fresh and tasty too. Definitely it was on a better side than I thought. 
I suggest you to check on the deals and place an order which would make it much cheaper.

The other thing about Pizza 73 I was impressed was that you could order online.  I could build my order without hemming and hawing.  So easy.  After I ordered, it gave me a confirmation # and a confirmation email.  Went to pick up the pizza and it was ready waiting for me.  It was still piping hot!  

Service was pleasant and quick.  I'd order multigrain pizza anytime from Pizza 73."}

Since I'm in marketing, the packaging was just superb. A deeper, high-quality branded box, with 2 levels to put each pizza."}

Overall, really good for a Pizza 73. I am usually not a fan of their food, but this location is a huge improvement to what I'm used to."}
{"text":"When ordering online, we wrote, \"When arrive, yell, IT'S PARTY TIME!!\" under the \"Special Instructions\" section of the online form. We were overjoyed when our tiny Asian delivery woman did exactly that. 

The pizza was average at best, on the other hand. Better than the time I ordered it from the NW location near my house, but still not as good as other places. I always get suckered by their 2-for-1 deal. Seems so afforable.

2 stars for the pizza, but 3 stars for comedy."}

Confusion abounds - I can barely make out what she's saying. Ask her to speak up. Now have disgruntled pizza lady yelling in my ear. 

Calm down, pizza lady. Yes, I'll have the mild sauce. Yes, I'll take the whole wheat crust (BIG MISTAKE!). Yes, I'll pay with \"WEESA\". Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes. Stop yelling. Hang up.

Strange that pizza lady has two volumes: Screaming, and whispering. 

Wait way-too-long. Hungry. Hungrier. Hungriest. Debate eating poker chips. Resist.

Pizzas arrive - Pizza man is only reason this place gets 2 stars and not 1. My outside light doesn't work. He romantically says, \"No problem, there's a big, beautiful moon up there.\" Poetic. Deserves better job than pizza man. Poet Laureate? Takes off in his crappy car, never to cross paths again. Wish him well. Hope he's happy out there.

Delivery man and phone lady should switch jobs.

Bring the pizza inside. Not very hot. Worst of all: whole wheat crust. Taste and consistency resembles cardboard box. Overused analogy, but now I understand why. Flavorless. Bland. Brown. Sad.

Mediocre pizza at best. Eat it because super hungry. Not even good enough to save the leftovers for lunch the next day. Travesty. Kids in Africa probably would have loved that pizza. Regret it, but only because of fictional 3rd-world children staring longingly at my discarded cardboard crusts.

Won't be fooled by their 2 - for - 1 deal again. Don't get whole wheat crust. You'll regret it."}
{"text":"We ordered on a Wednesday at around 5:30 pm. The order arrived by 6 and was fresh and hot. It was, however, missing the potato wedges which we called the store about. They were redelivered about 45 minutes later. After calling about the wedges (which my daughter really wanted, so she didn't eat), we realized one of the pizzas was missing half the toppings. Decided not to call. The online ordering was good but does not allow for 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. Not really family friendly.

Sorry Pizza 73, not gonna order again."}

{"text":"I`m a firm believer that there are a number of universal truths in the world as it relates to getting what you pay for.  Haircuts and pizza are at the top of that list.  So with that in mind I had fairly low expectations for Pizza 73.  Nonetheless I had some buddies over yesterday to help with landscaping the backyard and I brought in lunch as part of saying thanks.  Went with one of their many web specials which included two pizzas, four cans of pop and four bags of chips.  $40 included two pizzas (three toppings each), four cans of pop and four bags of chips.  

I wasn`t expecting much, and no I wasn`t overwhelmed, but the pizzas were tasty, fresh and had a reasonable amount of toppings.  

For a quick & cheap meal not a bad deal!"}
{"text":"This new location is exactly what the area needs: a good, quick place to satisfy your pizza cravings, with great hours. The two times I've been here so far have been solid. The staff have been friendly and I've had my hot, steamy, cheese and carb disc in my hands in under 15 minutes.

They currently have a walk-in special for a large one-topping pizza for $9.99 which seems like a good deal compared to other pizza joints in Calgary.."}
{"text":"Both times I've been here the customer service has been good and my order has been ready faster than the estimated time. There isn't much parking here so you may want to order in."}
{"text":"The pizza is cheap and that's what you get.  I've ordered from here 3 times and I live on 80th ave approximately a 2 minute drive from the location. It has always been late. I ordered 45 minutes early and my order didn't come for 90 minutes. Their customer service phone line is rude and unhelpful. They are unapologetic about how slow and terrible their service is clearly. If you want cheap pizza, pick it up. Delivery is the worst. I would order from pizza hut or papa john's. At least their pizza will arrive in a reasonable time. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"I get food delivered once in a while. It always arrives fast and is good. Recommended."}
{"text":"Ok this is NOT the best pizza I have ever had but the offer GLUTEN FREE PIZZA.  And not one's made on a square shelf stable pizza \"crust\" made by Kinnikinnick like to other popular companies (coco & BP)  The crust was kinda chewy not crunchy which is a plus and there was not funky texture.  I tasted like NORMAL pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni pizza and some boneless wings for take out. The lady at the counter was friendly, and the food was ready fast. (10 minutes)

The taste was decent, though the pepperoni was too crispy. The wings met my expectations, but didn't exceed them. 

Overall, this wouldn't be a place I would go to all the time, it would probably be more of a place I would go to if I was in a rush and was craving pizza. Still a pretty good experience though :)."}
{"text":"For as one reason they use 3 cups of sauce for 8 wings. Don't get wings late at night"}
