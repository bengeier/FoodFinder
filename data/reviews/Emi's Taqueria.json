{"text":"I ordered 2 street tacos because I figured that would be safe.  The corn tortillas were not cooked so they got soggy, there were too many raw onions on top and they were very small for the price.  Also, they were pretty bland.  I thought i'd give it a try but will not go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, not coming back. This was my birthday lunch. Order was messed up (ordered a burrito and got a cold enchilada, unfortunately we didn't recognize it until we came home). The food was tasteless, cold, and tasted like right out of a can. They take no pride in what they do. Not good food."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican place. Don't let the price scare you if you know what real Mexican food is this is the place for you! And it's a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Having lived in San Diego for many years I was very excited to see this place open. I ordered 5 rolled beef taquitos with guacamole a carne asada burrito and an order of beans. Carne asada burrito was about $7. Was looking to get a good size burrito. I would call it medium at best. Tortilla was not cooked on flat top. Meat inside is not skirt steak or flank steak but some chopped steak. Not really carne asada. Burrito was not hot. Was missing Pico de gallo. Steak had no char. And was not hot. Rolled tacos were very basic. No Cotija cheese. And I was served chicken instead of beef. These were also not hot. Pinto beans were excellent. They do not give you any hot sauce with your food."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've had in a long time, there's only one way to figure out whether you like it or not and that's to try it out. There's reviews where it's compared to another state or it having an emotion standpoint due to your birthday. This place is outstanding. Great fast friendly service. Amazing food. I too lived in Sandiego and it is in the running. I've also had this food for my birthday. The food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"It was good not great! It seems to be more authentic, but just missing the final touch that would make me be a regular. I had the al pastor- great flavor on the meat (homemade per the owner!) Because it is a faster service business though, the guac goes on cold and it just makes the burrito feel colder than it is. Overall above average but not enough there to drive me back regularly."}
{"text":"Just cruised thru drive-thru at 11:15 am. (They open at 11am). Had grilled chicken burrito-delicious and large portion for $5.99. Grilled chicken with pico de gallo, salsa and guacamole rolled perfectly. Also tried grilled chicken street taco on corn tortilla with cilantro and fresh onion. I added their hot sauce-excellent too! And only $2.49!!! Great food-great prices-very nice people!"}
{"text":"Food was very bland and was okay. A lil pricy for the type of food. I would recommend going to another Mexican restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Got to try Emi's for the first time today for lunch! It was fairly busy but they got everyone through the drive thru quickly while also taking walk in orders. The service was friendly and the food was phenomenal. My only regret is I didn't order more! I had the pastor burrito and chili relleno. Both were a treat!! I can't wait to go back and explore the rest of their menu! Very pumped there is finally something there! Must try! I would add a photo but I ate everything too quickly. Next time!"}
{"text":"Ok, so the first few weeks were kinda crazy after they opened. However, that is fine because they are a new restaurant and need to find their groove. They have, and the food is still great! The staff is getting their act together on order accuracy (which was a big problem at first). Also, the line is moving at a normal pace. 

I have to say I am a little concerned because my family loves their food a bit too much. Seriously, try the Grilled Chicken Quesadilla or the Al Pastor Burrito and then tell me you have had anything in the state of Ohio like it. 

I love this place because the food is by far the best Mexican food in town. The prices are great. And I can get it to go. I really have no complaints because any flaws I run into feel quaint and good in the manner that you can only find from a small, family run business. 

I hope they stay open for years to come."}
{"text":"Great little place in \"Funky Ko Medina\"! Been meaning to try it out for awhile but was skeptical since 1) It's in Medina 2) It's basically a drive-thru.
So on Cinco De Mayo I took the plunge because I didn't want to cook and I was intrigued by their sign pushing Fish Tacos 
Ordered three of those, 2 fish and 1 marinated pork. They were pretty good! Heck, I'm not sure what would qualify as excellent here(?) I guess since it's Medina I'd say they were excellent! 
The Mr. ordered the Chimichanga special platter (#5?) and subbed the pop for a Horchata (cinnamon rice milk drink) - both he really enjoyed! 
All in all a great choice for Cinco De Mayo or anytime you want \"real\" Mexican food. 
One last thing: phoned in the order and went inside to pick it up. The \"kids\" were very nice and courteous apologizing for the 3 minute wait - I'm like \"what?\" And they said \" since you ordered by phone we should have had it ready sooner. Crazy! BTW the drive-thru had a pretty long line. Definitely the sign of great food!"}
{"text":"Always a fantastic experience at Emi's. I am so grateful this place opened up! Delicious, authentic Mexican food. So yes, the wait may take a few minutes.. but that is because it is fresh, not fast food. It's worth it. Pictured here are my already half-eaten taquitos haha (I get them every time), a carne asada quesadilla I cannot wait to try, and a strawberry banana smoothie! I highly recommend ALL of their smoothies. I got the mango one a few days ago and you could even feel the texture of the mango in the smoothie - it was delicious - so you know it's real fruit used, too! The owner is always so kind and upbeat with a smile that totally just brightens my day. Thank you Emi's!!!"}
{"text":"A true Mexican joint. Fresh made tortillas. Fish taco was solid. Carne asada buritto was just like the one's I've had in California."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see this place open! I finally got a chance to check it out, and I know that a lot of other people have too, because there is always a line around the block! I had the Al Pastor and the Carnitas street tacos, as well as the chicken taquitos. I had a horchata to drink. The service was fast and friendly, even with the long line. Everything was amazing and I can't wait to go back and try more of their extensive menu! Finally, a decent place to get a quick bite in Medina for less than $10 that isn't a chain!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Great place for great Mexican food! 
Service is quick and friendly!  The street tacos are a must!"}
{"text":"This little corner restaurant serves up big flavors! On day 1 they had so much word of mouth business they actually ran out of food.  Day 2, my daughters and I parked the car and walked in.  We were greeted by a very nice Se√±ora who made us feel very welcome. The girls each had combo plates @ around $7.00 ea. (Nice Portions). Food was authentic & great! It amazed me how composed they were considering they had been slammed non-stop since the grand opening of their restaurant on 12-14-17. 

They were cool and collected and on top of the throngs that came out to see what had replaced Joey's that had sat empty for years now. The wife stopped by tonight and had steak taco's and enchiladas and really enjoyed it.

Bottom line...Affordable, Authentic, Fast Mexican food  close to home a definite win for Medina. We are glad your here!"}
{"text":"I like this place because it is close to home and service is pretty fast.  Food is ok.  I like the Al Pastor and Chorizo street tacos.   The cheese quesadilla is good, burritos, chips, and most of the platters.  We eat here often.  Great convenience on the south side of Medina."}
