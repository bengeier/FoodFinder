{"text":"We have been to the Vin Room (West) twice now.  The most recent time on New Year's Eve.  Each time the food was incredible and so was the service. While the idea of a tapas only menu took some getting used to for us, I can say that we quite like the idea now. For anyone looking for a recommendation, try the lamb.  I'm generally not a fan of that type of meat, but it was absolutely delicious!  My compliments to the Chef.  The wine list is extensive and well organized, and based on the ones we tried the tasting descriptions were right on the money, which I don't find is the case at a lot of \"wine friendly\" establishments.  This is incredibly helpful if you're like us and like to try something new every time. Above all else, we have really enjoyed every wine from their list so far.  And we've tried quite a few!  Wines seem to vary from about $35-$40 per bottle up to about $125 per bottle, with an average in the $50-$55 range.  All in all the Vin Room doesn't make for a cheap night out, but it's worth what you pay.  The only reason I dropped the review to 4 Stars is the seating. Both times we have visited there were only two of us and we were seated to the left of the bar near the entrance.  The seats there are incredibly uncomfortable to sit in while dining and the tables are so small there isn't enough room for even the most basic of cutlery/dish ware.  It really makes you feel cramped and it's hard to relax.  Which is really the point when you're out drinking wine.  **To support this comment, during our most recent visit, we overheard two other people asking to be seated elsewhere for the same reasons.  Though since we have never been seated in any other part of the restaurant, I can't say what the seating in other areas is like.  I would also note that when making our most recent reservation we indicated in the comments that we would like to be seated elsewhere, however that wish was not honoured.  Though being New Year's Eve I do understand that it may not have been possible.  So that's less of a complaint and more something we took note of.  Despite these drawbacks I would highly recommend the Vin Room West!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a truly excellent meal here and will for sure be back! The tapas selection is excellent and we were pleased how our server and the kitchen created courses that worked together based on the variety of dishes we had selected. They have a variety of wine flights which was a nice treat. Cost of tapas and wine was a bit high but fitting with the upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was good, but small portions for what you pay. I have been there 3 times and each time the service was very poor."}
{"text":"I've never been to the other locations, so I can't make a comparison. But my experiences at Vin Room West have always been good.  An eclectic and delicious selection of tapas and drinks. The portions are the perfect size. Lobster nachos? Heck yes.   We've always had great service there as well. I love to go to Vin Room whenever I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Was here for an engagement party and the event was handled so well. The food was great and the wine selection is brilliant. The service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Well, $13 for 2 small scallops (they tasted okay at least) The food was okay...not bad by any means  BUT...Big but It is beyond unreasonably priced for very little food. Plus the service was slow at times...took a while for our food to come out The place is very nice and pleasant  If I was a billionaire, I think if like it more"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight and was highly disappointed with the service and the overall unorganized staff.  The food was average, nothing spectacular.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm completely obsessed with the Vin Room Mission, and I've been eager to head out to Aspen Woods to try this location..  I love the meat and cheese selections here and have been craving the delicious St. Andre soft cheese, wild candied salmon and elk salami since my last visit to Mission. If you are a charcuterie lover, you simply must try the cured meats & cheeses here... They are DELICIOUS!   I noticed that they recently added confit duck cassoulet to the menu and was immediately sold. The duck arrived perfectly cooked inside and crispy on the outside. The white bean cassoulet was melt in your mouth delicious and the perfect accompaniment to the duck.This excellent dish reminded me of a meal I had at a bistro in France..   My friend and I also shared the flatiron steak and the lamb chops with feta & spinach, which were both very, very good.  For dessert, we shared the sumptious St. Andre cheesecake and the spiced pumpkin bread pudding. The perfect end to a great meal..  I was quite impressed by Vin Room West and will recommend it to friends & family. I am partial to the Mission location but I am glad to have had the opportunity to visit and will most definitely return!  Solid 4-stars!"}
{"text":"A recent visit to Vin Room West was disappointing: very expensive but tiny portions of good food, with less than mediocre service.   The dishes (tapas) are tasty without exception. The kitchen executes well. But the portions are tiny and pretentious. You can do better in many places in Calgary. The nachos with crab were tasty, as were the gnocchi.   What was startling was the service. Only two tables were occupied and we had to wait for service. The strangest was to have to wait for wine service - it's called Vin Room. Wine prices: very high.   I remember going to the original location in 4th street when it opened. And being unimpressed.   So decent food, below-par service and super expensive: doesn't sound like a winning combination."}
{"text":"This place is admittedly hit or miss...  it when it's a hit, it's delicious! We've learned to just stick w the same dishes because we've been disappointed a few times when we've ordered something else. We always get the lobster nachos and my husband gets the wild boar gnocchi. They are always delicious! The service here is also consistently good. Everyone is always very friendly and professional. They even have complimentary dog treats so we always take one to bring home for our dog. Will be returning."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been here for lunch.  And it will be the last!  Both times we were told they weren't offering the Bento Box (so then take it off your menu on-line) and no soup option.  Seriously???   We ordered the eggplant chips which I swear were prepared yesterday and simply reheated.  The crab cakes were bad.  Whatever fish they used was smelly and was overwhelmed by all the mayo and binder.  I couldn't even finish mine.  Oh yeah, $15 for 3 tiny crab cakes.  The beef carpaccio was nice.  It came with handmade potato chips, arugula and garlic.  The seasonal vegetable plate wasn't roasted today.  Again I got the feeling it was yesterday's leftovers.    Maybe they do dinner better but it's clear they are putting no effort into lunch.  So then don't open for lunch.  For over an hour we were the only table in the place.  I asked the waiter if he could turn the music down as we were having difficulty having a conversation and he responded by saying \"but I like it loud\".  He did turn it down, but just do it without the attitude.    Will never be back."}
{"text":"Best pet-friendly patio ever! The food & wine are great too! They offer some unique events!  We highly recommend the Pups and Prosecco Sundays (dog training/socialization with some prosecco!). Stay after the \"class\" and take advantage of the Happy Hour menu (and they have treats and \"pawsecco\" for dogs too!)  We also recommend gather some friends at the Jeans and Jazz Fridays to kick off the weekends!"}
{"text":"We loved it here - away from the parking hassles of downtown. If you love wine, this is the place for you! They also have really cool bottled beer from all over to choose from. (no draft) For food we tried the beef empanadas. They were decent. They have a little brisket in them and a lot of potato. They desperately needed salt, maybe a little garlic or adobo seasoning. They are definitely an interpretation, not South American styled and I do not think they are trying to be. They were a little bland for us but the outside was crisp and crunchy-yummy. They have many local goodies, meats, cheese, beer. The mood in the Vin Room was great. It was a Wed night and not busy. On weekends of course the place fills up. We sat in the lounge and the tables are tight, tight together! Not great for intimate conversation but a nice setting all the same. Staff were very attentive, gave recommendations without hesitation and we would come back for drinks just based on service alone. The downside is that you sink into the lounge chairs and are really uncomfortable on the back. I loved the wood and brick feel. The place is FULL of wine bottles climbing the walls! Will return! 3.5 stars. Bring your friends for wine and a fun tapas style menu! (check your bill at the end - I was overcharged on a couple of things but these were remedied with staff attention)"}
{"text":"Love this location.  Was a bit leary because I love the ambiance of their first location on 4th street.  Modern interior/decor and first rate staff.  Have visited mostly for lunch and once for dinner.  Lunch menu is vast and service has always been amazing.  Dinner menu I prefer as you get a larger selection of tapas.  Service however slipped a bit.  Service forgot to put in 2 menu items.  Food is very good.  Creativity and flavor are features at Vin.  Wine selection is fantastic.  So many by the glass, that revolve quite frequently."}
{"text":"Won't visit again.  Neither should you!  I'm not one to review many restaurants but I felt the need to warn readers about Vin Room west tonight.  My wife and I decided we would try out Vin west after experiencing Vin mission (which we loved) a few years ago and we have thoroughly decided to stay away from visiting again.  We started with ordering a half bottle of wine which took 20 minutes to receive.  While ordering dinner we ask a few questions about the type of featured cheeses etc. and our recommendations came down to \" I dunno what that is but it seems kinda popular.\"  The oysters were tasty, along with the overpriced chicken meatballs but really it was the serviced that lacked.  We saw our server maybe two times during dinner and each time she came around it seemed like we were paining her with any requests.  We had to ask for the bill two times and for the host to order a Taxi for us. When were ready to leave we we had to grab our own coat checked jackets (what's the point of a secure coat check if no one is checking tickets?) And I was told no taxi was ever ordered.  Service 1/10 Food 5/10 (fancy applesauce? C'mon..)"}
{"text":"I do generally like the food here and have tried pretty much everything. (Note to Chef: Crab cakes are lame and need major improvement). Portions are a bit small for the price and stuff not always served as hot as I would like (temp). The stand out is the wild boar gnocchi! So delicious, please don't EVER take this off your menu. I like that happy hour is 3-6 and then at 9:00 - close again. Service is always a bit of a crap shoot with level of wine knowledge. I took my best clients there for a closing dinner and they really enjoyed it. When I got the bill I was p*ssed. $35 for 2 martinis?! Really indecent. If not for the clients sitting in front of me I would have had words right there. After that gouge job I haven't been back. I dream of the gnocchi but will not be ordering drinks again."}
{"text":"My second time at this restaurant and it was super great as before. Very good atmosphere, great customer service and super delicious food and great selection of Wine. They have live Jazz music on Saturday nights which was also great. They exceeded my expectations and I definitely give them 5 stars at this time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what was worse....the service or the extremely loud music.  Our waiter was slow and seemed confused.  He forgot our last tapas until he was reminded.  Our vegetables came out alone without another hot dish.   Most of the food was decent, although not great.  The tacos were soggy.  Our last drink was extremely slow in arriving and our neighbours first drink took a half hour to arrive.  We won't return."}
{"text":"I like Vin Room - I do even if I am fighting with the other location ... But the two locations are like night and day - downtown vin room is warm intimate and cozy vin room west is cold and open. Our table was huge and we of course ordered too much food.  It was great the owner came by and she is lovely. But what threw me off was the noise! It was SO LOUD! Not quite the atmosphere we were hoping for but it was still a great evening. Food was great, wine was fantastic just the atmosphere of Vin Room was missing."}
{"text":"Visited Vin Room West recently and enjoyed their excellent wine and food menus. Plenty of wines to choose from if you're looking to sample a few by the glass and the food menu had notable standouts with mussels in tomato sauce, paprika shrimp and fresh oysters. There was a party above us so it became a little hard to hear one another as the night progressed but we enjoyed ourselves, our food and our wine. And that made up for the noise. The server was also very helpful."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday lunch with family and it is a very nice place. The artisanal greens salad was quite tasty and I enjoyed it very much.  I ordered the Grilled Flatiron steak for $15 and really enjoyed it a lot.  My husband had the Montreal Smoked Bison Reuben for same price and said it was excellent !  The food did take awhile to get to the table and I was glad we were not in a rush for our lunch outing.  This was nice if you have the time to sit back and visit and not have just an hour for your lunch time. We all enjoyed the lunch and would come back again for these items."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the family meal this evening - what a great deal. Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Last night was out first visit to the Vin Room West and we came  away quite satisfied. Meeting friends there early so we could take advantage of the happy hour was our plan. We arrived just after 5 to a very quiet restaurant and were surprised as it was Saturday night and we expected it to be busier. The ambience of the place is wonderful so we didn't mind being the only ones there.   The Vin Room has a stellar Happy Hour with stellar wines available for $7 per glass and a variety of food offerings. I chose the Sauvignon Blanc and it was delicious.  Food was prepared perfectly and there were a variety of options to meet our keto needs. It was slow food night and we spent over 5 hours there with the last two hours listening to great live jazz.   My only complaint is we had 3 servers in the span of 5 hours which I thought was strange. Our first server came by at about 6:30 and dropped off dessert menus. This was a surprise as we had mentioned we were going to have more food. We didn't leave there until after 10.   Overall a great experience and we will certainly return."}
{"text":"I guess that it's about time to write a review for this place.   I had originally be taken to Vin room on 4th street years ago by Jeff. A co-worker of mine told me about the new location closer to me in Bragg Creek.   We have been here twice now and would definitely go back. The ambiance is great, not too loud and has interesting decor. The food is wonderful for sharing and there are a BUNCH of veggie options that don't lack on the side of taste.   If you're not drinking the pricing works out pretty cheap. The wine selection is vast however, expensive so not for the faint of heart. Also, I'm not a HUGE wine-o so I think that there are probably a lot of aficionado's that would like it here for the vino selection.   I'm a classic cocktails gal myself.   Good location. Lots of parking. If you're early enough you don't need reservations, I would call ahead just in case especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here on the patio.  The server was extremely friendly and attentive.  Being our first time here, she was happy to ask questions about our dinner preferences and recommended a number of dishes.  The wine list is huge, so we asked for wine pairing suggestions.  She was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic to suggest the best wine pairings and we had a few 2oz samplers of her recommendations.  The food was great and portions generous for a \"tapas style\" restaurant.  A really excellent experience, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Vin room west is definitely Great!!... I really really liked this place!!.. The wine is really good!.. And all tapas are delicious... My favorite would be the lamb meatballs; but everything else was great!.. The sizes of the portions could be bigger.. But I still enjoyed everything I had... The scallops were very good, but only 2.. The beet salad surprised me, as it was way better than I expected!.. The shrimp were very tasty too!!.. The ceviche was my less favorite.. It was not terrible, but not the best option of the menu... Everything else was really good.. I definitely would like to go back there, as the wine selection was great, and the service also was really really good!!.."}
{"text":"We visited this tapas house last night with clients / friends and it was very good. The wine list was amazing and I loved that you can order a little or a lot of wine and price is pretty much the same per ounce as if you were to buy the whole bottle.  Since this restaurant is new the servers are still learning and is the kitchen. Most of our tapas came out a bit colder than I would like which was unfortunate but they have their growing pains."}
{"text":"Our friends came here for our annual holiday get-together, as it was one of the only restaurants open for large parties on a weekend in December.  Beautiful interior, and we love the idea of Italian styled tapas.   However, nothing will top our favourite Italian tapas place in Toronto, this was a nice experience, and everything tasted lovely.  We had the grilled squid, which was done perfectly.   I really enjoyed the arancini as well as the lobster nachos.  For a large party our bill was a reasonable price, and the wine was delightful.  We'd definitely come back again to try some more share plates."}
