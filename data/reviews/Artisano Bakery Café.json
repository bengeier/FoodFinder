{"text":"I ordered a sirloin sandwich and a salad. The sirloin was chewy and gristly and the  salad dressing was too tart. Much better food at Panera or Stony's bread co."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh sandwiches. 

I bought a danish, thinking that it would just be bready like most are, however, it was incredible. It had the fluffiness and moistness of a delicious croissant. The creamy coleslaw is the best I've had at a restaurant.

Also, it offers an incredibly cozy environment and the staff are really nice. 

Not too expensive."}
{"text":"I'm trying their$7.99 breakfast. Its toast, eggs, bacon, sausage and an orange wedge. I got the eggs scrambled and it is so dry. The bacon crumbles, its so old and dehydrated. Nice atmosphere but maybe I'll stick to tea and a pastry next time I come. Only tried it out because I bought a groupon."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Saturday and had an extremely negative experience. I ordered the half chicken sandwich/soup combo. They were short on staff and it took 25 minutes for my order to arrive. The soup was extremely cold and the sandwich WAS NOT FRESH. I am pretty sure the chicken has been out for a while and not stored at the proper temperature. Despite their claim as using \"fresh\" ingredients, I was very disappointed in quality and value of meal. Because I was running late to a meeting (didn't think my order would take 25mins), I could not go back to the restaurant to have them fix the issue. Never again."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews on this place. The servers were decently pleasant. I checked out the place around 4pm on a Friday so it was very empty, therefore lots of seat selection with free wifi! I ordered the chicken Brie apple sandwich. Guys, this sandwich was delish!!! The whole place is over priced. Id pay 10$ again for that sandwich but no way 5$ for a piece of cake that is probably frozen from a factory and was meh. Wasn't too happy that the coffee here is bottomless for the same price of one cup of tea that isn't bottomless. At least let me have my tea and then have bottomless coffee since I payed the same amount. Overall it was an ok experience. But the sandwich was great!"}
{"text":"Artisano has some wins and some misses. The turkey/avocado sandwich is terrific - real turkey (not deli meat!) and the sandwich is huge (easily big enough to share). The farfale carbonnara is a very small portion for the price ($10.99). It was heated in the oven so I can only guess it was pre-made at some point and just reheated.
I was there before lunch, one order ahead of mine, and it took 20 minutes to get a sandwich and heat the pasta. Not very convenient.
What was very off-putting was the demeanour of one of the staff. The person who took my order was very friendly, suggested I could buy some bread (at 50% off since I was buying sandwiches/pasta which was great), an all around pleasant experience. However when this nice person asked a question of what I assume was the assistant manager, the A/Manager was snippy, demeaning and just plain rude!
I may go back and hopefully this A/Mgr is not there."}
{"text":"I like supporting local Canadian chains however this specific location sucks. Every single time I come here the wait time is ridiculous. There was a total of 2 other people here yet it still more then 25 minutes for 1 breakfast sandwitch to be made. You are given a pager but when it reached the 20 minute mark I quietly went to the counter to see what the hold up was. The youngish Asian women behind the counter said \"You see the pager you have, when it buzzes then you come and get your food\" Ummm yeah DUH Im just here to see what the hold up is I wanted to scream. Her face looked super pissed off and her tone was beyond rude as in how dare you stand there before your pager went off. Had she just said Im sorry for the wait it will be ready soon it wouldnt have even been a issue. PUH LEEASE! Do yourselves a favor and go to the Panara Bread across the street for much much faster, friendlier, efficient service. I will never ever be back."}
{"text":"I often frequent the Artisano in Etobicoke, which has become an extremely popular place. 

The one in Oakville hasn't taken off nearly as much, which is too bad because their food is great too (all their bread is baked on site...at least it is at the Etobicoke location and I imagine the Oakville one is the same).  Their menu has a wide variety (pizzas, pastas, cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches), and I've noticed better deals at the Oakville location than the Etobicoke one.

I like the system of ordering at the counter and then choosing my seat.  It's like high end healthy fast food in a very comfortable environment.  

I've gotten excellent service every time I've been there. I even celebrated my birthday there one year (long story) and they were great about accomodating 20 people and even let us store our ice cream cake in the refrigerator!

I should mention that I've always been in the evening."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that this location is finally open after weeks and weeks of walking by and seeing the \"opening soon\" sign!  I don't know what it is, but I have the GREAT fortune of always having an Artisano's close by to every office I've ever worked in.  I'm not sure if I'm following them, or if they're following me - but either way it's a love affair.

This location JUST opened, so I haven't tried their lunch service yet (hence just providing a very respectable 4 stars, because I have faith).  I did however stop in this morning for an old favourite - the cranberry cloud.  If you haven't had a cloud yet, you are missing out.  Think mid way between a scone and a muffin top sprinkled with sugar.  These things melt in your mouth and are a-maz-ing!  The people at the cafe were also very nice and relaxed, which is always nice in the morning.

The restaurant itself is pretty big, with plenty of room if you're planning on eating in.  Can't wait to come back for lunch and get the spinach/avocado/gorgonzola salad - another personal favourite.

Tip - their take out containers are great and can be reused over and over again!"}
{"text":"i encourage erin to try this location again.  it just recently opened, so i'd like to believe that any mishaps she might have found were due to a new location being opened. 

i love artisano bakery.  i used to work close to the location at burloak and wycroft, and i was sad to be leaving that location ONLY for this place.  as luck would have it, my new job is even closer to the dundas and winston churchill location.

i ordered the half and half combo -  chicken and grilled vegetable sandwich (same at erin c.) and walnut/avocado salad.  the sandwich bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  the goat cheese was creamy and warm and i had a nice serving of chicken and vegetables in every bite.  

salad was amazing - same as always.  fresh avocado, walnuts and blue cheese on wild greens with honey mustard dressing.  i could eat this every day!

when i went it was nearing the end of the lunch rush but there were still a number of people in line.  the staff were efficient in getting everyone through as quickly as possible.  

can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice - once for lunch and once for dinner.

I usually base my reviews almost completely on the food, but Artisano loses a full star for being completely disorganized. The system seems to be set up pretty well:

1. Wait in line to make your order
2. Take a buzzer
3a. If you're taking out, wait for it to buzz and pick up your food at the back
3b. If you're sitting in, stay at your table and they'll find you

The problem is that the cashiers are extremely slow and can't seem to find any items on the computer. Then the kitchen at the back seems to have only one panini press, so if there are multiple sandwich orders you'll be waiting a while. How often are there multiple sandwich orders? ALWAYS because that's pretty much ALL they serve (plus pizza).

As for the food, it's decent.

For lunch I had the grilled chipotle chicken with avocado sandwich. Good bread, fresh ingredients, a solid sandwich when you're looking for something simple and tasty.

For dinner my date and I split the Hawaiian and Chicken, Brie, & Goat Cheese pizzas. They're a little small with too much fluffy crust for my liking, but (again) the ingredients were fresh.

Worth a try, but make sure you have enough time and patience to deal with their broken system."}
{"text":"This restaurant had poor service at the front counter. My meal came late about 20 min. late. This restaurant is not good if you are going there I advise you to make another lunch choice."}
{"text":"Pros.
Food is delicious, although a little on the pricey side. 
Plenty of seating.
Pleasant grey haired lady who is always pleasant and has a smile on her face.

Cons:
-It seems whenever I go there they are out of at least a couple things.
Today was no different. Out of broccoli soup, and two different kinds of bread and it was only 1pm.
-Confusing register area, no one knows where to line up and as other reviewers have said, the layout is just poor. 
-Food handling area is very dirty. When picking up my order I peered over the counter and the floors were filthy, with more than a days worth of dustballs. And the counter was a mess with old food beneath the grill press and random sandwiches everywhere.
-50 cents for a small bag of chips seemed like a money grab, seeing as other eat-in bakery cafes in the area, offer chips as a free side."}
{"text":"Not really a review since the doors are still locked. Posted hours on website says they open at 9:30 am, 1.5 hours ago. It is, however, a beautiful day so we shall wander around. So many choices in this neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is very similar to Panera Bread. I came here and ordered the \"choose two\" combo. I was pleased w/ the size of the 1/2 salad it was very generous and had tons of cheese yum. I ordered the avocado and walnut salad which comes with goat cheese on a bed of spinach. It was really good.
The menu has a wide selection of options. I really liked the panini I had (it was a chicken panini).
I would return if I were in this area again. Nice alternative to all the greasy fast food joints and chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I have tried to eat at this location many times but often find it closed, despite the hours posted saying it would be open.  The one time I did catch them open at 6pm, I tried to order the pizza just to be told they where out of dough and that it would take around  30 min to defrost. Disappointing. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food is great but man, figure out where customers are supposed to line up and give them some direction. I was there on a busy day and customers were lined up in the narrow walkway that goes right between people's tables meaning you're sitting there and someone is standing practically on top of you. It's like eating lunch on a subway car. Then to top it off, customer's think that's how you get back to the other tables as well so they try to squeeze through which is almost impossible. An older woman with a walker had to get through so I bunch of us had to get out of line just so she could fit through.

Poor planning to say the least.

Food was good but I did feel sick later but can't conclusively say the two were related."}
{"text":"There's something about Artisano Bakery Cafe that doesn't feel exactly right... its very name sums it up, actually. It's a name that sort of directly grabs the \"artisan bakery\" trend by the horns and tacks an \"o\" at the end of it and - Bam! You've got a franchise baby packed and ready to go. Everything from the menu, to the food, to the decor seems to reflect this - mimicking what a genuine artisan bakery/family-owned cafe might look like. Additionally, giant signs that basically scream \"Franchise!\" everywhere seal the deal. I'm not sold.

It's a weird system - you go up to the counter, order your meal (pizza and pasta deals, soups, salads, sandwiches are your mains). Staff are friendly enough, but also a giveaway that the people behind the counter don't love or worship the food the way a true artisan establishment would. They love it the way they might love being behind a Tim Horton's counter. After ordering, you get one of those flashy black notifiers that blinks when your order is ready (wow! really traditional and authentic!). Sadly, the table next to us had a faulty one and had their meals sitting at the counter with no claimant, and a confused server running around checking everyone's flashy thinger.

Food was average considering the price - pizza is a thicker dough with lots of air bubbles, and it tastes alright, fine but nothing noteworthy. Something of note, however, is a rather reasonable multigrain crust. Surprisingly doesn't taste like cardboard and there are poppy seeds! Charming! Among our party was someone who ordered soup and another who went for the cannelloni. All came with a nice crispy salad, which was perfect on the patio. In short, this place's niche is for that target market who wants something sort of more chic than Swiss Chalet, but not quite Sassafraz. 

I just can't get over the fact that they're called \"Artisano\".  I was set up for Puccini and I got Il Divo instead."}
{"text":"My favorite Café in Toronto as a Backpacker because you get much for little money: come before 11am, get the bagel/Open cup combo($3.75 or so) ask for the WiFi password, chill on one of the couches. The place is big, comfortable, atmospheric, you can get as much Coffee as you want (5 different sorts), the Avocado - creamchesse bagel is awesome, water is free, sometimes the Softdrinks too, the WiFi is quick enough for Skype or Video streaming, and the waiters are kind. Didn't try the other foods but the place is popular and in the morning, noon and evening full of people, but in the inbetween times it's quiet and empty (10-12,2-5). Recommended for low budget backpackers definitly!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were driving towards the theatre last night with little time and empty stomachs. In a desert of greasy fast-food, Artisano appeared an oasis. Boy were we wrong...

I am a huge fan of the American (now Canadian- hooray!) chain, Panera. And upon first glance they are comparable. The atmosphere is much the same and the service style is identical. But where Panera scores, Artisano misses...miserably. 

We both ordered sandwiches which came with a choice of side. The choice of chips and apples were underwhelming, leaving us to both choose the pasta salad. It was nothing to write home about and sadly the best part of the meal. 

The sandwiches on the board sound delicious- DO NOT BE DECEIVED! Though delish for the first bites, it quickly becomes a soggy mess that gums up on the roof of your mouth. Appetizing. I now understand how dogs must feel about peanut butter. My friend had ordered the chicken, roasted vegetable and goat cheese panini. After much searching, we were left dumbfounded as to where the chicken was. After sending it back, the bread was burnt. Though they were apologetic about the mistakes, it seems a rookie mistake that even a newly opened business shouldn't have made. 

Though it is an alternative to the haven of the Golden Arches, that doesn't mean its a good one. I would have rather hit up a Subway or Quiznos and grabbed a coffee to go elsewhere. If I were to go back (and thats a big IF) I would bypass the sandwiches entirely and give the pastas/pizzas a try. Maybe with time, the kitchen staff will learn that less is more in the sauce department, making the food a little more edible."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times and had the pizza- perhaps it's because this is a bread-oriented restaurant, but I wasn't really blown away by their pizza crust. Ah well.

They've got a few desserts on hand (and some tasty samples up for grabs) and I thought their Portugese egg tarts were fantastic. Next time I'll get me a sandwich to try since that seems to be more their forte."}
{"text":"I ordered their chicken caesar salad for $10.  5 croutons, a dribble of sliced parmesan cheese, wilted lettuce, and cubed chicken that has a funny after taste.  There's an old saying: \"you get what you pay for.\"  Having relearned that lesson today, I wouldn't buy again."}
{"text":"Worse coffee in Toronto so far. I have tried their latte last week and it tasted of water and cardboard, it was just really old coffee with no taste. Today I gave it another try as it was on the way to work and I was running too late to make a detour. I had a standard filter coffee with milk. Again, the drink was horrible. I think the milk in the jugs is not fresh as the coffee tasted of cheese or there is something wrong with the coffee beans. Just don't do it. $4 latte and $2.40 for filter is just a rip-off for a disgusting drink that you won't even finish! 
I should probably also mention that there is only one lady at the counter that serves one person at a time so if the customer in front of you is ordering food, you might wait quite a while to get served.
Will not go again!!"}
{"text":"When a friend of mine (who worked at the Artisano location near Dundas/Winston Churchill) mentioned to me before the restaurant closed for good that she was looking to move to the location across from Oakville Place, I elected to make this a destination and try it out.

And I wasn't disappointed, though I do agree with some of the negatives people have mentioned.

My family and I stopped in here and were surprised to see that it was very busy for 6 p.m. on a Saturday (and closing in an hour, no less). At least three families came through the door, along with a rotating string of people visiting some vaguely-European man sitting in the booth behind us holding meetings.

Our service was very fast, though I can see how the setup confuses people. I don't know whether it's the positioning of the booths near the front or the signage, but the sign that says \"pick-up area\" is not where you pick up your food - it's the counter further on towards the back of the restaurant. 

Likewise, while our meals were delivered quick (done in less than 10 minutes, if even half that) we saw lineups quickly forming and people standing at the front counter for a good 10 minutes or more trying to get orders in. I'm unsure if it was due to issues with the debit machine or something else, but I could people getting frustrated.

Food quality and the service of the chef was excellent. The woman who made our food gave us extra salad dressing and was practically handing us extra handfuls of butter, jam and anything else we wanted.

My order, a half-and-half Tuscan turkey club sandwich and chicken caesar sandwich was much, MUCH better than past orders of the same type. As I mentioned in my review of the Winston Churchill location (www.yelp.ca/biz/artisano-bakery-café-mississauga-2), that place often disappointed me with their weak salads or half-hearted sandwiches. Here, the only problem I did notice was that the bottom half of the bun on the sandwich was slightly stale, though I'm not sure if the staff noticed this.

The woman I know at the restaurant wasn't working when I visited, but the service was uniformly good, and I can see myself going back in the future.

Well worth a look if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The very definition of \"hit or miss\".

I've been coming to this Artisano location every so often for several years, and the common denominator is that each experience varies wildly in terms of quality and service.

I've had incredible sandwiches (the first time I tried a Tuscan Turkey Club), weak salads with no cheese or dressing, amazing bread and lackluster/bland pasta salad. The last time I went (early January 2015, as of this writing) was another bipolar experience.

Maybe I'm just getting older, but I don't understand why the menu is so bloated with innumerable sandwich and side dishes. Walking in, I was immediately assaulted by advertisements - did I want a limited-time turkey/stuffing sandwich? Would I like a movie ticket to go with my combo? There are pasta dishes now? 

Not helping matters was a young woman who asked me what I wanted to order within 10 seconds of walking into the cafe. I can't tell if there's a disconnect between the staff and the patrons or if they just expect that people are able to memorize the myriad selection of entress and sides they have and are able to make snap decisions.

I had the \"choose two\" combo, and chose the chicken caesar salad and Tuscan Turkey Club sandwich. Another bipolar thing I noticed is that (on this occasion), they give you electronic buzzers to notify you when your food is ready... but they also deliver it to you, defeating the purpose. Why use them, then? (Is it because of customer volume? People taking the wrong order at the counter?) Why not use a stack of laminated papers with numbers on them? Why have that massive stack of buzzers if you're not going to use them?

The chicken caesar was one of the best salads I've had in a long while, packed with cheese and chicken. I can't say the same for my mother's salad, which was the exact same order - with half the chicken. On top of that, she had to pay extra for it because she inadvertently ordered it (a half-size) and a half-sandwich separately, and the cashier didn't understand how to key it in as a \"choose two\", thus costing an additional $2.50 for a half-scoop of chicken. They even argued about it at the counter, but eventually acquiesced and took out the surcharge.

My grandfather had the breakfast special, which (best as I could tell) was on point. Crispy bacon, three extra-large eggs done ay way you want, the works. It got his seal of approval.

Would I go back? I don't know. Their confusing and bloated menu (along with their service) leaves a lot to be desired, but the food is generally on point. Just be mindful of that if you go to that location."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Had pizza and chicken pesto sandwich.  Place is clean and well kept.  It is cafeteria service for ordering and then food is delivered to your table.  Opposite the toronto symphony orchestra and good for kids."}
{"text":"Pretty much empty after hours 6pm on Friday.  Ordered the My Thai soup and Chipotle Chicken sandwich with avocado.  Both were only mildly spicy, had great flavour and were fresh.  Casual atmosphere and close to the entertainment in the area.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"kind of in the middle of nowhere in the more industrial part of mississauga. 
we stopped here because it was late and it was open, plus our friend likes coming here for a quick and easy meal. 

this place reminds me of panera bread in the states. we opted for a soup and sandwich which i thought were good. like i said, very panera bread-ish. the staff was super friendly in accommodating us even though they were closing. fast, easy, and does the job."}
{"text":"Very disappointed when my wife and I went here on Sunday for a quick soup & salad.
The place was far from busy and it took more than 20 minutes for us to get our food. Then we it finally arrived the soup was lukewarm and was served without bread. My wife as for a chicken Caesars salad and it was served without the chicken. 
When we brought this to their attention we were told 'today is my first day here'
It will certainly be my last time there."}
{"text":"Such good bread. I love the olive bread. The coffee is pretty good as well. The is plenty of seating  and the atmosphere is good for a coffee shop."}
{"text":"The Newer Slower Williams Coffee

Like a new and improved Williams Coffee (if you've ever heard of one of those).  Artisano's offers better coffee, gourmet-ish styled food and FREE WIFI.

The Good
Yes the food is quite tasty,  and the staff exuded a positivity that will put a smile on your face.     You get a bottomless cup of coffee for $2.09 - and its better than most of the other coffee places. i.e Timothy's, Second Cup.

The Bad
This place has one fatal flaw.  There is a huge problem with the way the restaurant is setup.  AKA people line up right next to guests table... Its a little awkward at times.  Also, Artisano's really struggles with high traffic times, in and out side of the restaurant.  The service will take quite a while during lunch (just try to avoid this), and the small strip mall style parking lot will not aid your experience.

Recommendation;

PARKING;
Unless you see a spot immediately, then don't waste your time hunting just drive right around back.
My FAVS;
Try their dark roast coffee and split pea soup...

This place would have been four stars if I dined during at a low traffic time.  Besides that, if you happen to what a coffee and freshly baked/cooked sandwiches and soups HEAD ON DOWN to Artisano's!



Haiku for you;
Artisano's has
great food, great coffee, great times...
Horrible line ups"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised when a friend took me to Artisano's on a recent visit to the 'burbs. While my food experience in Mississauga has previously been limited to Milestones, Moxies, Earl's, or the like, this place had a little something else to offer. 

I could see how someone would easily become overwhelmed at the food selection upon entry as the large menu's greet you as you enter, but the staff made it easy to determine my final choice: bbq pulled pork sandwich. So good. The pork was moist but not a sloppy messy, and it was topped with a delicious cole slaw - something I'm not normally a fan of. My only criticism would be in the bun - it was a little too thick and dense for my liking. I ended up taking off the top bun and eating it as an open-faced sandwich. Equally as tasty.

My DC ordered a standard turkey-pesto sandwich, which was still quite tasty on that fresh bread. We decided to split a butter tart for dessert (which, like the bread, is made fresh daily at another location and shipped in) and I ordered a latte to finish off the meal. Holy S**t, I couldn't believe how good this latte was! Not only was it served in a fancy glass mug, it had a nice layer of micro foam, and was the perfect temperature.

Honourable Mentions:
- Fresh baked bread used on all of their sandwiches, PLUS fresh loaves also available to take home and enjoy
- friendly staff; prompt service"}
{"text":"I seem to be coming here a lot now that I'm hanging out in Mississauga. At first glance, it may seem exactly like a Panera, but for some reason I find it a lot more comfortable and the food tastes better. The staff is super nice and friendly, and the wifi is fantastic. They've also got a pretty decent breakfast deal for $3 - some fresh toast or bagel and a cup of coffee (unlimited!) so you can sit and enjoy your meal for a loooong time.

The sandwich varieties are all good (I've had quite a few already) and their salads are fresh. I'll for sure keep coming back here for a lunch or breakfast - the crowd seems to be regulars, and the staff is almost like family!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning (before 11) and ordered a double fried egg panini and breakfast skillet. Both were delicious. Cashier was friendly. It's similar to Panera Bread where you order your food, pick a table, and they bring it out. If you're a sufficient person, don't care for servers always checking up on you, and being left alone to enjoy the company of people you came with, this place is perfect"}
{"text":"Avoid for Breakfast!

This was by far one of the saltiest meals I've ever eaten. I couldn't even eat the potatoes. Servers were slower than molasses. I can't believe I spent $20 for 2 meals that we could barely eat.

On a minor note, the \"eggs your way\" was supposed to come with an orange slice. One came with a wedge, the other with nothing. My dining partner said the orange was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place. Ordered the chipotle chicken with avocado sandwich & My Thai soup combo for a bit over $12 including tax. The food was fresh & tasty and the server was friendly. Will come back again for lunch!"}
{"text":"One of my complaints about the Oakville/Mississauga border is that there's no places to get work done. 

I want some place relatively quiet (I can put on headphones), not too busy or too many distractions (hate when the guy or gal sitting 2 feet away from you just can't stay still) , open until a half decent time (at least 9 pm), has power plugs, serves coffee and a decent snack. 

Starbucks you say? The one @ southdown is too small with people constantly coming and going (and it's dang cold in the winter there). The one @ South Common suffers similar problems. The one @ Dundas and Erin Mills is way too busy. 

Second cup? N/A

iCoffee (a nice little find I made in Clarkson) - great, but open til 5pm.

Enter Artisano.  

1) It's a bakery/cafe, so you get good food (priced around $10), half decent coffee ($2), and a variety of baked snacks ($2-5).  

2) It's big, so you can find your own little corner. Also big enough that you're not distracted by hustle and bustle (population density).

3) It's quiet, at least, quiet enough when you throw on a pair of headphones.

4) And there are plugs!

5) It's open til 9-9:30pm daily. 

So, this makes it the holy pentinity (if that's a word, spell check tells me it's not) for a place to get work done! Hazaa!

P.S. The food as actually pretty good. Breads were good, half chicken salad was good, and the half turkey brie panini was also good (Erin, I\"d give it another shot - not far off from Panera imho)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch this past Wednesday just after noon. My sandwich had avocado and it wasn't until my second last bite that I discovered it was rotten and black and slimey. I took a piece of the avocado to a man who presented as the 'manager' and he didn't seem at all concerened barely uttering a response of any sort to me. When I pressed him to check his current avocado stock to ensure they were fresh, he brushed it off and offeree me a replacement sandwich. I just ate. He gave no apology and no sense that it mattered. Will never go back for Slimy, Black, Rotten Food."}
{"text":"So this place had virtually no items available on a Friday afternoon. The cookies they did have were stale and hard as rocks. Then to top it off the ice machine had a lovely layer of green mold growing on the ice chute. Thanks for nothing!
Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Mixed review on this one.  Came last summer for breakfast and that was good.  Eggs made to order and fresh toast brought to your table.  Fast forward to April 2013, weekday night dinner.  Salad or soup and sandwich combo.  Roast beef was two wafer thin slices of beef on dry mediocre toasted bread.  I swear you could see through them if you held it up to the light.  If it was a $6 meal that would be ok but it was $13!!!!!  Soup was good but tepid instead of hot.  The Artisano on  Islington close to the Queensway is far better."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

After one visit, I feel that this is a pretty good place to eat. We came on a Saturday around lunch time. Pretty quiet which is good for us. We ordered at the cashier and took a buzzer and got a seat. I don't have to pay tip which is wonderful. Drinks are self serve at the machine. They bring the food to your table.

We had a pizza and a pasta. I really like their pizza. I'm not a pizza expert but this pizza is loaded with toppings, and nicely decorated. We had the multigrain bread and it's one of the best pizza breads I've ever had. The bread is not super thick like in Pizza Pizza. Artisano's is perfect imo in terms of thickness. 

The pasta was good too. I absolutely can't stand pasta at those fancy restaurants who charge you over $20 for a pasta dish and put practically nothing on the plate. Artisano's pasta has plenty of toppings and is very flavorful.

Speaking about prices, their pizzas and pastas are highly reasonable. My pizza was $12 and was more than enough for myself. The pasta at $12 was also a good deal. I typically only get pasta from Boston Pizza only on their Tuesday specials. I haven't tried their sandwiches. Maybe next time.

I think Italian restaurants are famous for their romantic atmosphere. This is not one of those restaurants. This is simply a good place to get good food at reasonable prices, which is a VERY welcome change for an Italian restaurant. I hate getting ripped off at those fancy restaurants that expect you to tip a million dollars on top of ridiculous prices. Don't get me wrong, we need fancy restaurants for those special dates. Just not so many. We need more places like Artisano for Italian food to satisfy foodies.

Why no 5 stars? I think their water tasted funny."}
{"text":"We like going to Artisano on Dundas West. They have really good sandwiches, salads, soups and pastas. I particularly like their cannelloni. It's served piping hot with crusty toast on the side. Yum! We've had their pizza a couple of times and had tried the whole wheat crust as well. I prefer the regular crust though. They also have a selection of desserts to go with your coffee. The service is good and ambiance is pretty nice. They have free wi-fi, too."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for coffee and pastry. There is lots of seating and prices are reasonable.

I ordered a cappuccino and chocolate croissant.    Others had espresso, cake, biscotti, and tart.

We didn't order any sandwiches or entrees.

Not a bad hangout with friends for afternoon coffee break."}
{"text":"This used to be a really good coffee shop a few years back.  Muffin and coffee combo (free refills) were $2.29 and the Eggs in my pocket were delish (like a huge panzerotti but with a western omelette inside and marinara sauce on the side) and were around $6.99 at one point.  They raised the muffin and coffee combo to $2.49 and now is $2,69 and the Eggs in my pocket went from 6.99 to $7.49 to $7.99 to $8.49.  

Fair enough.  I can deal with price increases in today's world.  Everyone's gotta make a living.  However, they've gotten cheaper with the side dishes. They used to include a skewer of fruits (strawberry, cantaloupe and honeydew ) and now all they give is an orange slice??? seriously!!!  The one on Dundas near the Costco gives fruits.  

Also, the last time I went here, it took about 40 minutes for the food to come out (usually takes 15 minutes) .  I get that places get busy, but here's the kicker, after 39 minutes I get up and inquire - the cashier said \"someone before you ordered the same thing so we cancelled the order\".   UMM WHAT???  I PAID FOR IT UPFRONT!!

This isn't the first time I've come to this location disappointed.  Another time, they said their oven wasn't working.  Not their fault, but still.  

I try to avoid this location as much as possible and you are better off at the Dundas location near the Costco."}
{"text":"Had what Canadians called a cloud. I ate it so it most if not been that bad but the description does not match what is. A cloud should be light and fluffy and maybe have some more sugar in it. The cloud was dense and doughy but still tasted full of lemon flavor."}
{"text":"5$ for ham & cheese croissant. One slice of cheese and one slice of ham. \"Stay hungry my friend\"."}
{"text":"This place is inconsistent.  It's funny that they got shut down because they never handle their customers efficiently.  I've tried the pizza here and it's always full of extra flour and it was always different sizes.  I don't know why this page isn't updated to show that they are shut down."}
{"text":"Great hidden place to have capucino, work, or just relax in the middle of busy day. No Starbucks etc. come close to comfort and coziness this place offers."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but the quality has gone down.  The bread and their sandwiches aren't so much artisan anymore and tastes like a typical chain restaurant now.  I'd rather go to Panera now."}
{"text":"I visited this place yesterday and was very pleased. Food was good, portion size was decent. Highly recommend the steak sandwich with chimichuri sauce and roasted vegetables, I asked for mine to be toasted. It was nice place to chill with my girl friend and grab a bite to eat. I really liked that they served alcohol. It's very clean inside, and they give you buzzers to let you know when your order is ready. It has a Tuscan/Mediterranean feel to the interior.

Definitely coming back to try the lasagna one of these days."}
{"text":"Just went there for lunch today and was definitely one of the best lunch places I've ever to in the downtown core! For $10, you get a choice of a half sandwich and either salad or soup - all sandwiches are gourmet and loaded with fresh ingredients, plus the breads are all freshly baked. Salads were also delicious and NOT the typical caesar/garden that most restaurants throw on as a side - I got the baby spinach and arugula, which was topped with shaved parmesan, mandarin oranges, and candied walnuts. Definitely cheaper and much better value than any lunch combo you can get at one of those big chain restaurants. Service is also really quick, which is great for those of us with the 1hr lunch breaks from work. Will definitely be back again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Croissants buttery....  Flakes but  a little expensive  $$  I give it 8/10


Hot  chocolate ....  Avoid it bland.    Taste  mostly  of sugar  than  chocolate  2/10


These two  items  end  up costing  me $7.00"}
{"text":"Great place to visit before a show or just meet up with friends. Great service and very friendly staff. The food is fresh and very tastey. I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Ugh. I didn't realize calling a place artisanal something, actually makes it good. 

Aside for a nice interior, and inconvenient parking, there is nothing to this place - seriously the worst latte I've had in a long time - I'm almost tempted to go try a latte at Mickey D's, to see if it would be better (won't be surprised if it will be). 

Never again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I was expecting from Artisano but I didn't really get much. We both ordered the lunch combo and a coffee, which cost $29. The half sandwich was about a half cup of chicken salad and all bread! They called this a gourmet sandwich - what a joke. The Kale Super salad was small soggy and tasteless. My salad was just ok. 
I would never go back."}
{"text":"One of the inevitably frustrating things about reviewing eateries is that I can't obviously rate places on the food that I DIDN'T sample. One, I'm not going to ask all of my dining companions for a sample of every single thing that they have in front of them and two, I'm a vegetarian so there's lots of stuff that I obviously can't eat (my own choice of course). In some cases this may not affect said review but with Artisano it sure doesn't do them any favours. 

I wasn't feeling a sandwich or pizza (I had just had both the day before) so I decided to sample their cannelloni (one of my favourites). I don't have it as often as I'd like and the fact that they advertised all of their gourmet pasta dishes as being \"created using fresh, wholesome ingredients\" and to please allow 10-15 minutes, I was hopeful. Although I'm sure that the ingredients they used were fresh at some point, they sure didn't taste like it by the time I got to me. It tasted like frozen, microwaved cannelloni, the kind I'd buy at Loblaws. And I would do a better job ensuring that the thing was cooked through...it was a touch watery and still cold in the middle. It was edible and didn't taste awful so I didn't send it back although I probably should have. The baguette that came with my pasta was quite good (I'd hope so from a bakery type place) and the side Caesar salad was better than I expected it to be but still not enough to make up for the very disappointing (and rather insubstantial) main.

My sister's \"Kale Supersalad\" was really anything but...she thought it tasted a bit funky and although I don't think that was actually the case (she too didn't send it back but probably should have) it was pretty lackluster. Might it have been sitting out for a while and getting soggy? A distinct possibility. I know that the coleslaw that my dad got with his sandwich had been because he didn't even touch it and this is a guy who NEVER leaves food on his plate and I mean never. Both he and mum liked their sandwiches (a turkey avocado and a grilled chicken respectively) but again, I can't rate based on stuff I didn't try.

I'm not sure what I was expecting from Artisano but I didn't really get much. I didn't complain too much at the time (I always hate to do so at a family dinner, especially if my dad is footing the bill) so I guess I'll have to vent a bit here instead. The sandwiches looked (and tasted, according to family) good but the cold cannelloni and salads that have obviously been left out aren't going to win them any points."}
{"text":"Absolute worst food and management! 

We ordered a $10 \"grilled veg & provolone panini\". The cashier and server were nice and smiling. However, while the buns were warm, the veggies were completely ice cold. 

My pregnant wife asked for it to be warmed up and the manager (I am assuming it was the manager, as she was both on the phone and retorted loud enough to be heard from the other end of the restaurant) was visibly annoyed and said that if we wanted a grilled panini warm, then we should have said so at the beginning! Go figure that one out! It's \"grilled vegetables and provolone\". Tim Hortons at 2AM would have made a better panini. Absolute condescending response from management. That's not all, a few minutes later, they came back and dropped, at our table, completely charred carcinogenic buns. See attached picture. 

Extremely disappointing experience. Avoid at all cost. Will not return."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite before heading to the Royal Alexandra Theatre for a show. What a nice cafe!

The menu is nothing fancy, but it all looks good -- pasta, pizza, soups, salads and sandwiches. We sat in a quiet corner, and enjoyed grilled vegetable paninis with cole slaw and a spinach-beet-goat cheese salad on the side -- all very flavourful!

The panini bread is excellent, and the vegetables were good (not at all greasy like you find at some places). The dressing on the spinach-beet salad is light and lovely (not oily or vinegary).

We splurged and split a large hunk of carrot cake. It was moist and sweet.

I noticed a few people lingering over wine or coffee. Nobody appeared to be rushing them away after they'd finished their meals.

This is a nice place to stop on your way to the theatre (or even for lunch)."}
{"text":"This is a nice change in the king street west financial/entertainment. One can get tired of the big chains as your only choice.  So props to these guys for  trying to compete with the big guns.

They offer a varied menu of sandwiches, pastries and other lunch goodies as well as coffee. But what really drew me in was the bread they sold. Grant it I didn't buy any but it what makes them different from the rest.

On top of that, the setting is a modern cafe almost cafeteria like if I could say that. 
As a place to sit down and chill, I think it serves its purpose well.

The reason I came in was coffee . A nice Americano with a cookie is my Achilles heel.
Terribly disappointed.  I only finished it because I didn't want to waste my money.  The drink was such a weak espresso with extra water.  It tasted like gas station coffee with extra water. I was deeply disappointed. The cookie would have been alright if it wasn't rock hard. Bathe flavour profile was there but the follow through not so successful.

I would definitely consider going back to try the bread though."}
{"text":"A good solid 3 stars. Always get the half soup and salad combo for 9.99

Try the cookie called \"pudding cake\" which is a must-try

Free wifi is great as well. Used to go here a lot when I was working for my previous company while I was \"working from home\"."}
{"text":"This establishment is not dog friendly. We were asked to move our very peaceful dog so that he was outside the patio area - yet at a restaurant (yes, a real restaurant) nearby, we were able to sit comfortably within the patio area. I found the staff aggressive and discourteous and will not be returning to any Artisano location... I used to like this organization: pity."}
{"text":"I come here often when I am waiting for my daughter. The only reason I keep returning is the free wifi, and the plentiful seating. I struggle every time to find something to order. The selection is abysmal, and the quality of the food is terrible. 

I just ordered a Mac & cheese, and it was the worst I have ever eaten. I'm fairly certain they just took noodles, tossed them in shredded cheese and nuked it. Greasy, with no sauce at all. Disgusting. I was going to order a quiche, but asked if I could get it without a soup or salad, and they said \"Sure! But, it's the same price.\"  Thanks, I'll pass...

No tea selection, and for a bakery, the baked goods are bland and boring. I've tried just about all of them...I've really tried to find something to enjoy!

I think I'll have to find other place to hang."}
{"text":"We stopped in here before our show at the Royal Alex Theatre next door.

The pumpkin soup was amazing! Absolutely delicious. With it I had a chicken panini, which was okay, but had nothing on the soup. The coffee was self serve and tasted slightly old.

It was kind of expensive for what it was. 2 coffees (regular, not fancy), 2 soups, 1 half panini and 1 individual quiche cost $30!

Service was good and washrooms were clean.

All in all, I'd come back for the pumpkin soup."}
{"text":"I may have just had a bad experience here, but I probably won't be returning. Some other reviewers have compared it to Panera, and I can see why. They have pasta options that I was curious to try -- and maybe I should have. I had the grilled cheese with bacon (can't recall the name) and it was one of the worst grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had. I think we can all agree it is hard to mess up a grilled cheese. I didn't know this was possible, but there was way too much bacon. I ended up taking some off and eating it on the side. Plus, it was soft bacon, which is okay but not exactly great for a grilled cheese. The bread wasn't great, and it wasn't properly grilled, so the cheese wasn't properly melted. It was also expensive (similar prices to Panera).
Maybe if I lived much closer I'd give it another try, but unfortunately I made a special trip to try this place and regretted it."}
{"text":"Artisano is almost identical to other chains - Paradise, Panera, Atlanta Bread, etc. All of them (Artisano included) are \"okay\". They have soup, salads, sandwiches and a few pastas/pizzas. It's more expensive than fast food but not all that much better. 

In any case, this Artisano is kind of a hot  mess. They were out of multiple ingredients - cranberry mayo, ciabatta, apples, the list went on. Some things we were told about when we ordered, some things we discovered when we picked up (completely dry sandwich, no apples). Staff was certainly friendly but appeared completely frazzled and disorganized. 

Based on other reviews, it seems like this location is frequently busy so you'd think they would be, you know, USED to it and perhaps take steps to PREPARE for it. Or maybe they just enjoy their customers' disappointment? Whatever - the only thing that sets Artisano apart from almost identical chains is their incompetence."}
{"text":"Honest, caring, and professional service. 

The chocolate croissant and iced latte were the best I ever had. 

Clean facilities and free internet. What more could a costumer want. I will definitely will be chosen next time over a Tim Hortons or a Starbucks!!"}
{"text":"When I went here it wasn't busy at all, thankfully, so I didn't have any of the problems all the 2-star reviewers mentioned.

I was so hungry that I pretty much inhaled the Choose 2 combo (choose 2 of either soup, small salad or half a sandwich). The gourmet steak sandwich was delicious. It had roasted red peppers. The spinach and arugula salad was good too. The caramelized pecans are amazing! They accommodated my food allergy. 

Whole thing came to about $11. More expensive than McDonald's right beside it but much more delicious and healthier. It's funny, the McDonald's drive-thru was really busy, but for a couple bucks more than a Big Mac combo you can get a much better option. It also comes with \"signature bread,\" which is maybe 1/4 of a white baguette. 

This is a nice place to eat before jumping on the highway. I definitely recommend it for a quick bite."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this location of Artisano Bakery Café since they opened several years ago. 

The restaurant is bright and airy and always clean. The staff are circulating all the time, cleaning tables and removing empty dishes. 

This is a restaurant where you order and pay at the counter before you receive your food. They give you a pager so that you can pick your food up at the counter when it's ready, but most of the time they deliver it right to the table.

There's a great variety of sandwiches, soups, salads and pizzas. You can also order 2 halves of any of the choices (other than pizza). The prices are reasonable, but I wouldn't say it's inexpensive. For a half soup and salad or sandwich for lunch, it's usually around $12 or so. I love that they offer gluten-free bread, but the extra $3 they charge for that option makes a lunch there quite expensive. They have a fairly large beverage menu with cappuccinos, lattes, hot chocolate, coffee, tea and several cold drinks including a pop fountain.

The offerings are bit more 'gourmet' than somewhere like Panera. They have delicious salads with fruit, nuts, seeds, etc... Sandwich offerings also include panini. The gluten-free pizza is very good, with a nice crisp crust.

All in all, this is a good choice for lunch, but not really somewhere I'd visit for dinner."}
{"text":"1st time trying this place and I loved it! I went with a large group of people and everyone enjoyed their meals. 

They give you a beeper/pager that will buzz when your food is ready - which is cool! The pick 2 deal is reasonable in price and allows you to pick a soup, salad or sandwich. Their butternut squash soup is delicious! Way better than the one I make at home. Their veggie goat cheese panini was yummy too! Delicious and nutritious! Just the way I like it. I cannot wait to go back! Oh and they have free Wifi :) 

I just wish they had a location in Ajax."}
{"text":"Came in for a light fare and the food was yummy. Reasonable prices and friendly service!! Ordered the turkey chili, turkey avocado sandwich and kale salad. Will return when we are back visiting our Toronto friends!"}
{"text":"Artisano Bakery Cafe really reminds me of Panera Bread which I frequented in my hood.

But with more items aside from sandwiches on the menu, the cashiers were slow in taking order and then the kitchen got really overwhelmed and the lines started building!

I dropped by wanting to get a coffee... I know Tim Hortons just across the street, I should have went there instead. The line here move so slowly..... 5 minutes later I am still lining up.. I just want a coffee!

$2 for a bottomless coffee is not too bad since Artisano has unlocked WIFI access.. but this is definitely not a good place to have enjoy your coffee leisurely and get some work done. The seating arrangement are kind of boring too, all cafeteria style seating.... 

How come the line still NOT moving!!? 

I guess I should go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Daily special from Monday to Sat.
5 dollars a glass of  wine.
Cozy place, love the small fountain here."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, not quite as great as Panera. 

They have some awesome breads and desserts that you can buy to take home as well. 

Comfortable seating, lots of seating, which has is great! 

Would return."}
