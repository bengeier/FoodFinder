{"text":"This is by an office of mine and we've eaten here quite a bit.

Their lunch buffet is very reasonable and is usually quite good.

The naan is made to order and always amazing as well as the rice.

I'm not a fan of the Chinese dish that they usually have in the buffet, but it's not like you have to eat it.

Staff is very friendly and usually very quick."}
{"text":"We went with a lot of expectations to have nice hot biryani. There was buffet for dinner. We choose to just have biryani. The Chicken biryani was okay not spicy. I have had better biryani's at other restaurants. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"We went to Zaika couple days ago, for the first time.  Must say- each one of us were just amazed!  Variety, Quality, Taste and Price were wonderful.  We dined in for Iftaar buffet which was $13.99/person.  Included 6-8 types of appetizers/Iftaar items, followed by an excellent dinner which had about 8-10 items.  Service was pretty good, they refilled dishes frequently.  

We certainly plan to go back very soon with more friends and family!  Good job Zaika!"}
{"text":"Place looked dull and dark...no proper lighting
I went there today and bought chicken biryani; to be honest I just wasted my money. There were boiled potatoes in their chicken biryani and biryani tasted like plain rice. 
There are far better biryani places in NE calgary...never going to this place again"}

{"text":"Me and my friend ate there last night. We were told that buffet per person is $12. At the end we were charged total of $41. We waited for the rice till end of our meal. By the time we were done, the rice showed up. Compared to other buffet, that I have already eaten at, this place is worse. Zaika Biryani House, doesn't have all the stuffs that supposed to be served. That cow foot stew had lots bones and few pieces of meat and it was old. That was the special meal that night as the owner said \"funny\". 
All in all, I won't recommend anyone to go there unless, they bring required changes."}
{"text":"Despite having opened for quite a few months, I have never really noticed this restaurant.  Recently they put up an advertising board on 5th Avenue advertising their prices ($5.99 for vegetarian lunch combo, $6.99 for meat lunch combo, and $9.99 for lunch buffet).  I had a craving for Indian food and so I walked over from my office to give this restaurant a try. 

I had the lunch combo as I wasn't hungry enough to have the buffet.  For the combo, you basically get to pick one item from their buffet and they give you some rice and naan and call it a combo.  I had the butter chicken, which was good... not the best I've had in Calgary but good enough.  The portion size was decent and I ended up not eating all the naan that was given.  Overall not a bad place to eat given the good value."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place at least 50 or 60 times on my way to Pacific Place and managed to get some take out before the lunch rush. There's lots of parking as it's in one of the business strip malls. The main attraction of this place is the lunch buffet. It had a small selection of food mostly chicken, (3 types that day), a couple of vegetarian dishes and salad and some fruit. Cost is around $11 which is pretty reasonable for a buffet. The menu for take-out is a bit confusing so I asked the lady what there was and she pointed me to the menu that I couldn't really understand. I ended up with Chicken Biriyani which she told me had 3 pieces of chicken and rice. The cost was $6.29. That sounded really cheap to me. The 3 pieces of chicken basically consisted of the tops of 3 drumsticks and the rest of the container was biriyani rice. The flavour was decent but you are really paying a lot for rice. There wasn't enough chicken to go with the rice and you got a small container of raita which I didn't care for. The food was okay just I question the amount of chicken that was given. I might go back to try the buffet ($10.99) just to taste the rest of the dishes (4 vegetarian and 4 meat (mostly chicken)) but I would given this a miss for take-out."}
