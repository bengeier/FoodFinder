{"text":"I was really grossed out to see the cooks in the back eating their own sandwiches while leaning over the food they made for me. I actually threw it out after one bite. I had the Pesto caprese and it was basically all bread and their food in one sandwich. The smoothie I had was delicious but I really hate that they are not descrete about eating food. At least TRY to hide it from the customers! And it took them 10 minutes to figure out who was going to help me. Each worker would say hi and walk away but not actually stand at the register to help me. That was really weird. Would not spend my money here again. I also wanted to give feedback with the survey provided on my receipt and the survey wasn't even available!"}
{"text":"All ways friendly staff  ,the chicken avocado is my favorite ,i can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"They don't use gloves when making your food!! And manager was rude! Worst customer service ever!!Be aware!!"}
{"text":"Im making a public complaint toward the manager in this location. She is a white female adult with blonde short hair.   The cashier made a mistake. But fail to even say sorry. Calls the manager and tells the manager something else.  My bill totaled $6.04 I gave $5 Cash and eith that cash I gave my card and asked the cashier \"can I put the rest in the card?\" She takes them and nods her head yes.   Later realized she did something wrong. Tells me \"what did you want me to do with the $5 because it went through your card anyway\" I smile and try be polite. But am disappointed.   She and the manager confront me. Manager says,\" So you gave her the card first?\" I said, \"No. I gave her both cash and the card and told her to charge the rest on the card.\" She looks at the cashier and says,\"You took both?\"   Its obvious she lied to her manager or some miscommunication. Regardless what disappoints me to put her on blast here is this.   She tells me \"I dont understand it already went through. It will take 3 days til it refunds back to you. \" So i respond \"I dont have sufficient funds on the card that is why I gave the $5. Just refund my money back.\" She says \"but it already went through? Do you still want the drink?\" I said \"No. Just please refund my money.\" The she says \"Well just letting you know itll take 3 days\"   Fuck you! You disrespectful bitch! You dont deserve to be a manager! You dont even have any decency to apologize! Its not my fault your cashier made a mistake. If she didnt understand she should have asked me to assure it.   CUSTOMER SERVICE is a priority!! I will write to the company. It seems like your so use to treat customers the way you do.   Well, Im not letting this slide. You ruined my day! No wonder your cashier doesnt know how to apologize she gets it from you!"}
{"text":"I would have given 0 stars if I could.    Terrible customer service.  I'm standing in line while a staff member is talking about her nails with a couple other girls who are buying a smoothie.  She had already given them the smoothie to them.  She makes eye contact with me and walks to the back. She totally ignored me.   Then some guy buds in front of me and they serve him.  Then another guy comes up to the line and another clerk proceeds to ask him for his order.  I interrupted him and said I'm next.  Both guys were apologetic.   The manager told me I shouldn't be afraid to approach the counter. I called him on that BS,  he didn't even acknowledge me and I was where the waiting point for the next person is supposed to be and I knew what I wanted to order.  All I can say is WTF!  Terrible service.    Any the mango smoothie I had sucked.    And he girls nails even sucked more."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very healthy option for somebody watching their carbohydrate intake. I had the chicken avocado sandwich which was very tasty. It had fresh avocado, and was very light and healthy. A plus on a SUPER hot day shopping at the mall in Vegas."}
{"text":"Looking through the different food joints at the outlet mall, I was relieved to find this place especially because they served paninis. I ordered turkey cuban panini and being that i used to work at a food joint who serves this sandwhich i knew exactly whats suppose to be in the sandwhich. Just my luck, when i got my sandwhich it was basically a turkey and cheese sandwhich. NO pickles or mustard when its suppose to have those two main ingredients. To make matters worse, i went back with my sandwhich and politely (even with a smile) asked if i could get some pickles and mustard added because there weren't any. The cashier was nice to accommodate me and even offered to make me a new one. She said, \"you deserve what you paid for\". I appreciated her for that, however, the lady (hispanic middle aged) employee gets mad at me for asking for pickles and mustard, and to top it off looks to her co-workers and starts talking in Spanish. They all glare at me with ugly looks as if i was the one at fault. I just wanted a properly made cuban sandwhich! The hispanic lady rudely drops the pickles at the counter and sends me on my way. She tells the cashier not to make my sandwhich and even argues a bit with her. I lost my appetite after that. I've never experienced such poor service. I paid $12 to get this crap.  Management needs to get their stuff together or they should just close down already. Don't display a menu you can't make correctly. False advertisement. Very very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Review for adjacent Banana's Smoothies counter- if you view the receipts posted in pics, the two places are separate lines that merge to one register.  Salad counter has cafeteria-style buffet of toppings- four toppings seems to be standard, with $1/additional topping, which is absurdly high. At the least I'd expect the menu to have a few set salads to choose from rather than being exclusively build-your-own.   Other counter is smoothies: the superfruit smoothie is my pick, with strawberry, blueberry, and pineapple, for a sweet taste but no added sugar. Price difference from small to large is less than a dollar, so the large makes more sense at just under $6.  Service is pretty nonexistent, teens without social skills who toss your drink at you and can't answer menu questions. Typical mall food court restaurant in that regard, but this is probably your healthiest option."}
{"text":"This place is nasty - I got a salad with chicken that had been frozen and not fully thawed out. My wife got a wrap that was made 3 days ago (the date was written on the paper it was wrapped in). It was soggy and gross. We ended up just getting pizza. So much for choosing the \"healthy\" option."}
{"text":"Green Leaf's and Bananas is located in the food court of Las Vegas Premium Outlets North. Green Leaf's has made to order salads whereas Bananas serves smoothies and frozen yogurt. There are two lines respectively, and they both seemed to move slowly. We ended up ordering a Mango Magic smoothie and it took a while for us to get it as well. The smoothie itself wasn't as delicious as I'd hoped it be."}
{"text":"I had a very stressful day of shopping. I wanted a healthy snack so I decided to go to Green Leaf's & Bananas. I was approached with a beautiful smile from Giselle! She greeted me right away and she helped me pick my salad and smoothie. As I was leaving she said \"Have a great day, thank you!\" I was astonished by the service I received you do not see that nowadays! She is definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"Sour clam chowder. Sour clam chowder. Would not eat here ever again. Sour. Sour. Sour. (Yelp wouldn't let me post this review unless I write enough. Point's made.)"}
{"text":"If you are in Ross Park Mall and are hungry AND want something fresh and healthy, Green Leafs is your place. I get their salads often and am always impressed with how fresh and delicious they are. Much better than a lot of salad bar places. they give you generous portions of what you choose and have fat free dressings that are actually tasty. under $10 and you're feeling good!"}
{"text":"After a weekend of terrible eating choices, I wanted something more health conscious while wandering around the outlets. I decided to check this place out for a green smoothie. Yes they put green stuff (kale, spinach, etc) but I noticed they used vanilla froyo as their cream base. This made the smoothie very sweet and didn't seem very healthy anymore. I threw it away, and bought myself a $4 water bottle. Well I guess that's Vegas for ya."}
{"text":"First time here. Unfriendly staff, smoothie tasted horrible. I asked for a regular and got a large.  Ended up paying 7.00 for something I threw away.  I even took my receipt and tried to fill out the online survey and that gave me several error messages.  nothing good to report here!"}
{"text":"I can't believe you can mess up a wrap.  Ok so I didn't realize it's NOT FRESH when he was grabbing me my Caesar and Thai chicken wraps. I said to myself to still give it a shot. Paid $19 for 2 NOT FRESH wraps (keep in mind I came at 7pm on a Sunday, and they close at 8pm) and a bottle water. Still my bad on judgment I guess   So I gave it a go; it was cut in half and I started on the first. So far it was decent, can definitely tell its Not fresh and not worth the money.. But even the husband thought it wasn't good and the tortilla wrap was hard... I bit all the way down to the first half and it tasted a little funny. I thought to myself it's just my thoughts... Then I took another bite and I tasted rotten something, I was eating Thai chicken.  Incongruities tongue second half and then took another big bite and BAM it was ROTTEN. It had an old, hard boiled egg taste and again, I'm eating THAI CHICKEN  TERRIBLE. Terrible  Should have stopped when I noticed it Wasn't fresh.."}
{"text":"They are thieves we just ate there...they have sandviches on display but thats not the one you get. Its a totally different sandvich. Different size totally other kind of bread...compared to the one they are offering we received a very very tiny sandvich and we paid for that and the soda 12.99???come on........the soda they gave us half ice and 1 quarter of soda....the staff is rude I don even know how they are open still....definitely dont recommend to go there unless you wanna be disapointed..."}
{"text":"This is the WORST! I ordered a caprese panini and there were literally 2 basil leaves on THE ENTIRE sandwich. At first I thought it would be more in one spot I was WRONG!"}
{"text":"Chicken avocado sandwich. Chicken was half warm & cold. Avocado was charcoal dark? The bread was cut half assed for sure. See my pictures below. I'm being quite mild about this review and didn't even attempt to re approach them cause I'm impressed that the chef/handler of the plate would even decide to give this to me. I go by the belief that a chef wouldn't serve food to a customer unless they were willing to eat it themselves."}
{"text":"Ordererd a panini sandwich. .... terrible , they toasted/ fried the bread on a stale un cleaned grill or so becouse it smell like rotten oil all over my sandwich. No coffe ready when I ask for it, panini was trown into a paper plate it was estétically unpleasant to look...."}
{"text":"Visting from Hawaii, stopped at the North Premium Outlets for shopping and food. Daughter wanted yogurt so we stopped in. Service is terrible. They have 2 lines, one for salad and one for smoothies and yogurts. Stood in line for yogurt which only had one other person in front of me. Salad line was super long, about 8 people in line. Waited for a long time. Person in front complained that she was standing there for awhile. After taking her order, cashier totally ignors me and the growing line waiting for smoothies and yogurt. I ask loudly if there were 2 lines or 1. They replied 2 seperate lines (one for salad and one for smoothies) so i question why the salad line cashier was able to take care of 8 people compared with 1 in the smoothie line. Asked for a manager, Chris (the manager) does not apologize and does not take my order, rather he defends his cashier by telling me that everyone goes their own speed and that I assume he thinks it was perfectly fine that she couldn't even handle taking more then one order compared to the cashier next to her taking 8 orders. Another women worker steps in and handles the situation, takes my order and then does not take my money. She should be the manager, not Chris. Chris does not know how to manage his employees nor how to give quality customer service. Filed a complaint with Green Leaf's Beyond Great Salads with my email and phone number, no follow up. I guess this is how they handle business. No customer service what so ever on either end."}
{"text":"Solid place, the quinoa wrap was very good, I had never tried this place and walked away with a good experience, I would like to try some of the salads if I get the chance to check this spot out again, but overall not a bad spot."}
{"text":"$15 for a side salad, half a panini, a small soup and a bottled water.   Panini barely had any chicken, tiny bits of cheese and small pieces of tomato. Basically all I ate was bread.  How sad. Soggy bread in fact. Maybe workers were lazy to make it? Or that's just their quality of food? STAY AWAY from this food joint in the outlet mall."}
{"text":"Giselle (I hope I spelled her name correctly) was very nice! She helped me select a good juice,and it turned out to be very delicious and satisfying! I was skeptical at first to come to this food court (Usually food court have fatty-foods) but I'm happy I did. Thanks Giselle! The smoothie was just what my tummy needed."}
{"text":"They are thieves! Don't go there even if you are starving. They charged me $3.98 for additional avocado on 2 salads! The avocado was not eatable. I paid 28.04 for 2 salads and 2 bottle of water. I could go to cheese cake factory and have 2 good salads."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I ate at a food court.  So, I expected the worse and ended up with a deal. If you're at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North and you're hungry, then be prepared for a very minimal selection.  It's a good thing places like the Green Leaf is around. Service was good and the line was short.  I got their Spinach Salad with 3 sides of chicken.  Yup...this was a lot of pollo and it sure hit the spot.  For $7.99, I got a deal.  Call it a steal.  My meal was fresh and the chicken was edible.  The next time I'm at the outlets and the it's time to feed, Green Leaf and Beyond is where you'll find me."}
{"text":"was at the outlet shopping w auntie and needed to grab something non greasy so opted for a salad w chicken, broccoli, few red onions, salsa and idk what else lol.  I was like really a $9 salad but was actually well worth it.  I only ate half and had the rest the next day.  Good thing I got the dressing on the side!"}
{"text":"I keep giving this place another chance because it's the cheapest place to get a salad in the mall. Every time I'm let down by employees not wearing gloves, eating on the line, and their consistently old vegetables. The lettuce is always brown. Last time I went there I got corn on my salad that was spoiled rotten. Today I gave it one last shot & ordered a sandwich instead. The Pesto Caprese Panini had old, brown basil on it and instead of fresh tomatoes, there was an entire handful of sun dried tomatoes. Who puts sun dried tomatoes on a sandwich!? Has the owner of this joint ever even tried the food? The first bite was so salty that I couldn't even eat the rest of it. I have given this place WAY too many chances and will never be eating there again."}
{"text":"The menu looks appetizing with the calories and ingredients posted but I had the Greens Smoothie and it was watery, the bitter taste of kale overpowered the entire drink and I had to throw it away."}
{"text":"Very tasty fresh food! Sandwich not visually appealing but very tasty! (Turkey chipolte). Friends got wrap that they made fresh because she didn't want cheese. Great healthy choice!!"}
