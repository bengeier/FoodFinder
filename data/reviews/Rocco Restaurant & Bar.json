{"text":"Delicious Food! Calamari was awesome! Burgers are homemade and yummy! Sweet potato fries with wasabi mayo is a must! Very Attentive service! Recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner here Saturday night! I had the beef ravioli and it was to die for, I ate every bite. Good portion size left me satisfied. Husband had the baseball steak and it was cooked perfectly and seasoned really well. In addition our server was fantastic, very attentive but not overbearing. Told us on Wednesday's there's a $20 special for steak, fries and a beer, will be back for that."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We ordered the bruschetta to start, and salmon and a pasta dish as our mains. Both of us were highly satisfied. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time last week and was very impressed with the food and service. Their special for the night was steak, fries and beer for $20. Great value."}
{"text":"We called for delivery.  Ordered pescatore,  small veg pizza,  Mediterranean platter, garden salad.  Tiny portions and over priced.  The garden salad was the size of a side salad, 10$, good taste but double the price and less than half of the portion.  The salad at the Whole Foods salad bars are better and definitely less priced.  The linguini pescatore was just ok,  it wasn't spectacular.   It was 18$.  Small portion.  I was not even half full.  For 18$ and its portion I was expecting awesomeness.  The percatore at Gratzie IS way better tasting and will definitely fill you up.  The Mediterranean platter was not platter size.  It was just some cut up dry pittas with a couple of dipping sauces, 11$, not worth it.  If u want this go to Mi Va Mi.  They perfected pita and dipping sauces.  There was a 3$ delivery charge and we are just 2 blocks from the restaurant.  The pizza was just ok.  It was the size of a side dish like a personal size Little Ceasar pizza.  Lol.  10$ for a simple veg pizza.  Omg for 2 people we were not even half full.  Lol.  Very unsatisfactory.   I think they model themselves after trendy bistros like Eden Tratoria with their prices and portions.  And this rocco location just looks and feel like a neigbourhood pub.  But the taste is not there.  NOT WORTH IT.  RIP OFF!"}
{"text":"Great food, great specials throughout the week and very friendly and accommodating staff. Staff is willing to adapt food to your preferences or dietary needs.   Mondays and Wednesdays you can go for the wine, drink and appetizer discounted specials or go on Tuesdays for the live music.  They even now deliver! Thanks for bringing great food to the Lakeshore."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for seafood: had the grilled calamari and the portion was very very small- probably the smallest I've ever seen in a restaurant, although it had some very good flavor. Tried the shrimp and scallop melody; which contained questionable tiger shrimp. Once again it was a very small portion and tasted great.  Get some carbs and you'll be satisfied. The risotto was good and was a great portion. Above all the food tasted very fresh and service was also above average."}
{"text":"Not ONE piece of crab meat in my pasta. Flavor was okay but $19 for noodles in a cream sauce? No thanks. Calamari was completely over cooked and soggy. Wanted to like this place but never again. $43 down the drain! I do not recommend what. so. ever."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here and it's fantastic. The owner's are right there interacting with the customers. Both Mark and Todd go out of their way to make sure your dinning out is great. Lets talk about the food now, just like the service it is outstanding! Get this, the chef even ventures out of the kitchen to make sure all is well with your dinner. We have not been disappointed with the food, but if there is a problem as I said Mark or Todd are there and they will make it right. Don't take my word about this place give it a try and put your review up.  Mike"}
{"text":"My landlord told me that this was the worst place that he'd ever eaten...  so over this last weekend in September I decided to venture the the neighbourhood.   Well let me tell you...  of the three restaurants in the Humber Bay area. This one ranked second. And by no means the worst place to eat. The food was flavourful   the portions very very acceptable and for the price. You can't go wrong  If you're going to base your restaurant ventures on yelp reviews or friend recommend establishments...  you may as well just stay home. And cook dinner yourself...  I'd definitely eat here again..."}
{"text":"Went here last night for cheesecake and cappuccino. The slice was literally a sliver and the plate was fancied up with chocolate drizzle and meticulously placed blueberries. While the taste was good not worth $8.  The cappuccino seemed to be watered down a bit (not horrible) for some reason though it was made using the proper machine $4.  As I live in the area I try to check and see if things have changed and support the restaurant though it's been through at least three owners now and there are much better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Uber Eats I likely would have never tried this place, not for any other reason than the location is a bit awkward to get to and if you need to think on parking longer than a couple a minutes (and you're like me) you typically keep driving in search of another place to dine.  That all said, having ordered through uber eats twice now, I'm converted and I cannot wait to dine in with them in the near future.  The location, while hidden, is between Lakeshore Blvd W and Marine Parade Drive in south Etobicoke, literally a stones throw away from a romantic walk along the water which provides one of the best views of the Toronto skyline that I've seen.  My first order from them I had the steak sandwich and I was a little concerned that it wouldn't travel too well but the bread was still crisp and the steak was cooked perfectly and was incredibly tender. The toppings were also great - definitely a must have for lunch!  My second order was today and I went with the caesar salad and added grilled chicken and paired that with the eggplant parmesan. I like that the salad came separate from both the dressing and the chicken so the heat of the chicken didn't wilt the lettuce. The chicken was great and juicy and the caesar salad was a run-of-the-mill cream dressing, not fresh made so what you would expect from take out. The EPP was FANTASTIC! Top 3 I've ever had, including my Italian mothers homemade version - wow! Best of all hidden beneath is was a pile of spaghetti in tomato sauce!   Definitely a quality joint to deliver such great quality even for take out. Looking forward to trying them out in house one night soon (oh and apparently they do brunch?)  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"My wife and I live close-by and frequent Rocco's at least once a month. Their menu items are delicious and we've never had an issue with service. It's a great place to have dinner, sit outside on the patio or drop in for a drink. We also do takeout sometimes. My go-to dish here is any one of the risotto dishes. Never overcooked! The one thing I would recommend to the owner(s) and kitchen staff is what one review here mentioned. Don't ever let your customers see you smoke near the entrance or near the restaurant. Even is you wash your hands, it's not proper etiquette and potential clients will draw their own conclusions. Perception is everything!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a colleague. I ordered a veggie burger with fries. It was actually really good. I would go back for sure"}
{"text":"Went on a date here while vacationing in Toronto...  The food was great, the ambiance was good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We had veal provimi, so so bucco and spaghetti and meatballs.  All absolutely fantastic! Eden around the corner is good too but this is a less intense environment, especially if you want a quiet dinner and not want to wait a long time during rush dinner hours.   Note: no pizza on the menu.  Fine with me but just saying.....  A"}
{"text":"Great little spot by the lake in the Humber Bay area. Great stop for a coffee, espresso or latte. But the burgers are scrumptious as are the homemade fries. Staff and owners are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Zero stars.  My CEO asked for a place nearby where I live to have a lunch meeting.  I suggested Rocco's.  She made the reservation.  When we got there, a week later, the restaurant was fully closed.  They didn't bother to tell her that they weren't opening that day.  Likely due to weather, as it was snowing, but show some respect - don't just close without notifying people who make reservations.  AT least leave a note on the door and apologize.  This is the SECOND time they have done this.  There won't be a third.  I was left embarrassed and apologetic, on behalf of Rocco's. Clearly they don't care about word of mouth reputation. Ate there one other time. Food was just OK. Too bad there aren't many other choices in our area, but that too is changing - yay!  Don't recommend for a day time reservation.  Don't recommend for a great night out.  Overpriced and not great quality but will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"i would like to start off by saying the positive things about this restaurant that apparently is under new management. The staff was professional and very courteous. The menu had a nice selection of pastas, risottos, and meat dishes.  The appetizer that we ordered was a platter with artichokes, olive paste and hummus with pita bread. At first I thought that hummus in an Italian restaurant was a little strange but we tried it and the taste was terrible. It had a very strong curry taste not to mention the olive paste being way too salty. The main course that we ordered was penne arrabiata with hot sausage which tasted as though after the dish was made the chef just poured tons of Franks red hot sauce all over it to make it spicy. The other main course was the veal chop with risotto and veggies. The chop was grilled nicely however lacked flavour, the veggies were bland and not cut very well by the sous chef, the risotto was also bland tasting and a little mushy. We were told that they were going to be expanding the place to build a better patio area which is great since they have a great location however they should really focus on improving the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood Italian. Good service and competent cooking. Good sized portions. Family run. Go Rocco!!"}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about this Italian restaurant in the Humber Bay area. Nice big patio outside with a cozy interior. The owners are very friendly and eager to make your experience a great one.  They are more known for brunches here because of their patio, but they actually do a great dinner here as well.  We started our meal with the Antipasto platter - an absolute steal at the price they are charging - served on a nice wooden board with Buffalo mozzarella cheese, genoa salami, prosciutto, artichokes, marinated olives, grilled vegetables & toasted garlic baguette. The mozzarella is fabulous - fresh, soft and delicious!  The Fettuccine alla Pescatore (mussels, shrimps, calamari, scallops, baby clams, mixed peppers) was simply fantastic with the rose sauce. The pasta is made fresh in-house and cooked just right. Highly recommended!  The lamb chops and the almond crusted salmon were good as well, but definitely got outshone by the awesome pasta we had.  The only thing I don't like about the restaurant is the location since it is quite far from me, and you probably won't notice it unless you live in the area or look for it deliberately. But if you ever find yourself passing around that neighbourhood, it is definitely a great place to dine at.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Quiet community spot that dies its menu well.  More authentic food that other nearby Italian options and offers lice music on nights which is surprisingly unobtrusive and lovely.  Generous portions and quiet ambiance is good.  All the staff lined up on side tables  sitting as u use the restroom is odd but I suppose acceptable.risotto is served Al dente and service is very friendly."}
