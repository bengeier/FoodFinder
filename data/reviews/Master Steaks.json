{"text":"Go their for their juicy steaks and not so expensive pricing. ... being close by to Zets, we were expecting good food and was not disappointed...haven't tried their souvlaki yet... should not be half bad judging by their steaks ......"}
{"text":"It's pretty sad when you go to a place that specializes in steaks and they forget to ask you how you would like it cooked.  I asked for medium I got well done.  They were good about cooking me a new steak but it needed seasoning and a lot smaller than the one I returned.  The banquet burger was meh and the fries were undercooked.  $33 dollars for two people for mediocre food is not that cheap.  Sorry will not be returning."}
{"text":"There shouldn't be ANY rave reviews for this place...Ugh, yech!\"
Hmm? How do I begin this one..well someone had suggested that this was a good steak place and it had a patio? So I thought sure, let's try this one...First impression through the door was..What kind of joint is this? They have a good number of seats (many booths), not very clean, have the behind the counter menu, along with handmade ones, cash register and then butcher counter beside that. There was just too much going on but finally settled on a \"SPECIAL\" of a 24 oz portersteak with 2 sides for $22.99. There was a young man who took our order (who was apparently new) a young asian girl (*despise* she was supposed to be training him, Miss Attitude) and some other older gentleman who seemed kind enough asking if we knew where to order while being on his i-phone. Our order was quite simple the steak \"rare\", the young man asked us what kind of salad we wanted so it was to be a caesar, and the other side, mushrooms. Also a steak sandwich medium rare with fried onions and mushrooms and a fountain pepsi. We had thought that the order was clear, paid (he rang in our $$ bill but we wanted to get rid of some change) he was totally dumbstruck not being able to do simple math. The asian girl then corrected him. As soon as the order's printed up...ugh..they charged us for both sides! Plus didn't include the sandwich! So my friend said he would go and fix the situation..5 minutes later he comes back with the same receipt saying that the special I ordered is only valid on \"weekdays\" nowhere on that sign did it say that!! (i'm quite literate) then the sides, apparently they were part of the 2 free sides..they weren't disclosed at any point. So this is 15 mins after our 1st order...I begin to lose my appetite as does my friend. The asian girl treated him like an imbecile and didn't even let him speak, that's when he said for me to deal...hehehe. Of course (people who know me) know I will not deal with any nonsense whatsoever! I went straight to the girl and looked at her straight in the eye and asked what b.s. she was saying to my friend to which she tried to sell to me..by this point another girl joined The Team (hurrah!!) At which point the 3 of them all sang a different story! I've never met such dumb people, really...they should just be shut down for this alone!@# So then I get a refund for the 2 sides charged and get 2 free ones instead. My friend goes and proceeds to order his sandwich. My order comes up and guess what??? The steak is beyond cooked!! At this point more than fed up 45 mins to an hour being there..sent it back, appetite is completely gone! His steak sandwich is also overcooked..I can't begin to tell you how horrible this place is..if i ever pass by it again i will spit at it! (i have awesome aim) Whoever owns this business obviously doesn't give a crap about anything at all..Why, there were other patron's in there? Gawd only knows...If  I ever see these people again...outside I WILL TALK TO THEM...INDIVIDUALLY..for a nice wakeup call!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is an OK steakhouse, but their quality is very inconsistent. I have eaten here countless times, during lunch, dinner, late night runs, etc. About 70% of the time, I had a really good piece of meat, but the other 30% was miss: the steaks tasted bland, sometimes undercooked, or too salty. It was really inconsistent and you sort of try your luck with each visit. The best deal was the breakfast item where you get a 9oz NY steak, 2 eggs, a piece of toast and fruit/salad for $12 + tax. It runs until 2pm everyday. Otherwise, the 12oz NY runs for about $14. Steaks + beer (my standard combination) run for about $20 all in. I never ordered their ribs or shrimps: didn't look good enough to me and not what I was there for anyway.

Service is bare minimum. Two of their three checkout girls are nice enough. But the guys who make the dishes are totally rude, especially if he turns out to be the owner (who drives a BMW X5). Grab your plate and go. If you want steak sauce (not recommended, taste like mud) or ketchup, ask it when you get your plate, not after. He's not happy about that.

A word of warning though: any potato dishes was a disaster. Fries were throbbing in oil; mashed potato too dry; cooked potato bland. It's best to get the salad when you have a choice or just don't eat the potatoes altogether.

All in all, I like the place, and would definitely return. But you have 3 things to keep in mind before coming: (a) the price is really dirt cheap for steaks, and (b) quality can be inconsistent (more hit than miss but you've been warned) and, (c) service basically doesn't exist."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years, and really love it, but there's some things worth mentioning before you read on. 

This is not a restaurant to bring the family, or to eat at a patio. It has a indoro eating area, but its run down and poorly insulated, so you're exposed to outside elements. Food here is generally on the greasy side, but its definitely good and good value.

You can get a 16oz steak with 2x sides and drink for roughly $18, and the steaks are cooked perfectly here. The Beef ribs are to die for, but they took them off the menu, I guess they weren't too popular.

Burger wise, nothing special, just an average burger. This is a butcher AND a restaurant, so all the meat is cut and prepared on site, so you definitely get quality.

I've gone here at least 10 times, and all 10 times were at night after 7pm, which generally has friendlier staff and less wait times. Waiting for a steak dinner would be 10 - 15 minutes, and theres TVs on site so you can keep the wait times filled with TV goodness.

Theres an ATM machine and lots of seating too. Its a great spot to eat with the guys and girls on a night out clubbing or a pub crawl. If you're looking for trendy food, keep looking, but if you want a solid ma and pa style steak house trucker stop, you've found your match. Eat on, amigos!

Long live Master Steaks!"}
{"text":"We had the 16 ounce T-bone steak meal with mash, gravy, onions, mushrooms and Caesar salad...
The steak was med rare, grilled to perfection. That was the only thing worthÂ waiting for. With much disappointment the steak smelled off and absolutely no flavour. The steak sauce was the only flavour in the meal. The mash potatoes were cold, under mashed and the wrong kind of potatoes for its purpose. The gravy was watery , the veggies were from frozen, mushrooms from a can and the Caesar salad was over sauced and with fake bacon bits and a sad excuse for crutons. We spent $50 and suffered extreme disappointment. Next time we will continue our patronage at SCARBOROUGH FINEST. .. T-BONES RESTURANT"}
{"text":"Master Shit is what they should call this place! Overpriced and the owner is a cheap S.O.B! Terribly slow as well. I ordered mushrooms with my ribs and they put them on my buddies steak, when I asked for the mushrooms they wanted me to pay for mushrooms again when they made the mistake, so the owner takes the steak and removes the mushrooms from on top of the steak and puts them in a separate plate. Now the fact that I had to pay for them in the first place when I even had them leave off the potatoes and salad was a turn off in the first place. So the fact that they pulled off this stunt wasn't surprising, what a joke!!! Stay away from this dump!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! Run away! The place is filthy, food is terrible..... Steak had no taste, fries were cooked in old dirty oil and left a bad taste in your mouth. Went to get our money back and the owner said no! Was rude, not how you runs business at all! Save yourselves, over priced and disgusting, I paid $30 for 2 lunch specials that are now dog food! Deserves 0 stars!"}
{"text":"Love love love
Look it's not the keg but you get a version of a ny strip or a rib eye but it's not top end. But it's huge and done right and quick. 

The home fries are weird but the $15 12oz ny strip with eggs and toast and coffee were great. Lots of truckers and neat looking ppl. 

Don't be shy must try

Best part they made their own steak sauce so delish. Great now I'm hungry. 

Please go. It's no frills but a one of a kind. I'm from out of province so please go for me!

Ps they have any ATM or visa / mc for a small fee"}
{"text":"This place may look and have the feel of T-Bones West, but the steaks were just too salty for my taste.

I ordered the 12oz. Delmonco Special. Around $15+Tax, comes with a starch, salad and steak. The steak looked like a shoulder steak, with not much fat on it. I ordered Medium rare but got it more medium well. The steak tasted seasoned but very salty. The steak sauce they used tasted like a generic steak sauce, not the typical A1 or HP in stores. 
The fries were very bland, and the salad wasn't very appealing. 

Still looking for that secondary option for a quality cheap steak joint like T-Bones, my search continues."}
{"text":"Upon seeing all the good reviews, my husband and I (regretfully) decided to finally give this place a try. This place is way overpriced for what it is!! The food is 'palatable', but that's about as far as it goes.

I ordered Steak on a Kaiser for $8.99. That would be a fair price if it came in combo form, but by the time I ordered Onion Rings and a Drink (plus SautÃ©ed mushrooms and onions, which one would think should be included, but they also charge an arm and a leg for), I was looking at nearly $18 for a bloody sandwich combo - outrageous!!

The Steak that came on my kaiser was a Striploin, rather than shaved meat, so I'll give them that! But it's just a slab of meat, slapped on the grill, barely seasoned and there ya go! Not great, but not horrible. The Kaiser was tasty though! 

The staff proudly boasted that the Onion Rings were 'hand-dipped', when they were nothing to be proud of at all -  flavourless, pale in colour, almost 'fish batter-like', retainaing all their grease -  quite possibly the worst Onion Ring I have ever consumed, and the biggest shortcoming of the entire meal.

My husband ordered the 16oz NY Striploin meal - same deal and super overpriced as well! This is the kind of steak where I wouldn't yell at him if he decided to slather ketchup all over it. His fries were nice though! 

So in summary, if you want extremely overpriced, large 'trucker sized' portions and subpar food, this place is for you. I will say though that the staff were pleasant, so that's always nice!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the only decent deal is breakfast (which is not all day) and the burgers. Sure you can get a steak special for a decent price but it might only come with a salad or fries but that doesn't fill me up and I'd rather have rice potatoes salad and steak but it gets $$$. At least there's not tipping or cleanup required. Take ur tray, sit down eat and leave.
The Greek owners don't invest anything back into the place which is why it looks unappealing. Service is usually not great. The weekday lunch guys are arrogant and the late night woman with short hair hates her life and is always bitter. The old guy who works late is professional tho"}
{"text":"It's a great place after clubbing. The steaks aren't bad, not great. The onion rings are righteous and pairs well with any steak. The decor is standard dinner seating."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Delicious food. And amazing recommendations. Coming after a late night on the job, coming here to have a hearty meal and a cold beer is good. 

The ribs were soft and succulent. And their onion rings were one of the best that I had. Coming from a onion ring enthusiast this means alot. 

Stop by. It's aesthetics aren't to be fooled with their food and service."}
{"text":"First time back in a long time. prices are up but still a great deal for meat lovers. Had the 16oz NY cooked perfectly with sides of onions and mushrooms.The older lady is back, real rude to everyone, wondering why she is even there. Not as busy as the past, cleaner.

Bathroom dirty and stinky because of the drivers stinking up the joint holding their bowels for all those hours.

Worth it."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place for sure, and yes, it needs a serious update in decor, but it gives you pretty good food for a good value.  Like some people have said, this isn't a place to take your date for a romantic dinner but if you are out late and want some good food this place is a very good choice.  Don't even think about fast food or gas station food - get some good food cooked to order!  They offer a good selection and they cook it when you order, nothing is pre-cooked and warmed up.

As long as your expectations are reasonable (good, fresh cooked food and good value - appearances don't matter as much) this place will give you what you are looking for.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"This is my 14th time coming here and each time they are always out of something. I have come at different times and days, each with the same result. Something is sold out or not available.

This time I got the fish special. Not much to say about it. Tasteless, oily and soft. Usually when I order fish and chips I expect crispy, tasty fish. Usually the fries are good, but even my co-workers found them over cooked. 

I will try again, just because I'm guessing the chef was just rushing.

The steak are really good and big, burgers I find are hit and miss.

Lunchtime is not a time to go if your want something fast. Weekends are the best time to go or evening."}
{"text":"This place is not a cozy little place to take that special someone.  BUT IF you want to have a decent meal of meat, that is cooked AFTER you ordered it,  then this is the place to come.  

My husband always orders the pound of prawn shrimp,  not a cheap dinner but he likes the why they are done.  HOT in garlic butter.  

I always change my order from the chicken to the fish.  The Greek Salad maybe run of the mill,   but it's something different.

Located just behind a truck stop on Shaws on rd it makes a real change from Truck Stop food."}
{"text":"I've been doing this Yelp thing for going on 4 years, and every few months, I'll see a review for this place pop up. It'll mention that it's a Peel Region institution, mention that the building is no frills and a little worse for wear (expected since it's been around since the 70's) but over all that they grill a mean steak.

I'll be honest when I saw it as I was heading for another meeting in the area, I was like \"that's it?!\" But I remembered the reviews and figured after my meeting, given that it was lunch time, that it was high time I see what it's all about.

Walked in and the place was clean but definitely dated and seemingly held together with hopes and dreams. That said, it was the only less than favourable note I could make. The staff were friendly and when I explained that it was my first time there, they took the time to walk me through the menu and how it works there.

After reviewing the menu, I couldn't help myself and went in on a 16oz Ribeye cooked medium rare. The steak was cooked perfectly and although a thinner cut, was still SO juicy that I didn't even need to take a sip of my drink until halfway through my meal. The steak came with a choice or potatoes OR rice, with veggies and a salad. Seeing the Greek flag behind the counter I knew without question I was going with the roast potatoes - amazing choice! 

Even after upgrading my salad to a caesar, adding grilled mushrooms to the top of mny steak and ordering a drink the total bill (tax in) came to $26. Now where are you EVER going to get a quality steak dinner for under $30!?!? Not too many places.

This place is dangerous not thaw I've tasted their forbidden fruit... I anticipate several quick steak-cations in the very near future

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"It's an open 24/day joint that is next to the airport for a steak at discount rates. 
Were you expecting Jacobs quality Wagyu from Kobe, Japan? 

It looks like a diner from the movies or a shoot-em-up video game. The menu is brightly lit at the front counter. The process for steak is like this: You stand in line. You order. You get a number. The number is called by the chef in a very dirty apron who just determined your steak is now so called \"medium-rare\". You quietly retrieve your steak that the chef left on the counter and sit your ass down on one of the empty tables that doesn't have any dirty plates still left on it. Spend your meal  expecting Duke Nukem to barge in the front door to start a fight with the ruffians. 

I had their New York Steak with fries.

*5 minutes later*

I'm sitting at my computer thinking really hard about how I can describe this steak. Let's just politely say that you can make this at home with a pan with a steak purchased at No Frills. The home fries, you're better off at Costco. 

The food is the definition of mediocre. But seriously, why would you come here if you wanted something besides a mediocre steak? 

Why two stars then? It's a 24 hours next to the airport. It's not the Keg. It's not Jacobs. But it's food at 3am for a lonely traveller from China who wants to experience Canadian beef. It's got a clear targeted clientele and you KNOW if you're part of their target market.

If you're reading this review on Yelp, you're clearly not part of their target market.

Pick something else. Move on."}
{"text":"Had a craving for a steak and decided I would check out this old school dive. Knew what I was walking into with the dirty dive atmosphere; however, 6 years ago this place had the right recipe. This place completely fell off. Prices are astronomically high and the quality is absolutely low. Wondered where all the flies I used to see in the restaurant 6 years ago went. As they were nowhere in sight, seems as though the flies checked out. Uber eats baby! Btw, gave it 2 stars since I didnt see any rats running by while I was there."}

{"text":"Service is unfriendly but you don't come to this place for great service.

The steak they sell here is the best I had in a while. 

12oz NY + Caesar $10.75
12oz T-Bone + fries + med drink $11.29

Don't let the cheap prices fool you, the food is really great at this place."}
{"text":"Good steaks at a great price.

This place is a diner/dive/trucker spot.  You're not coming here for the decor or ambiance, but the good steaks for an unbeatable price and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars, good food and great value. (I'm a fan of Diners Drive-In and Dives so ambiance is not my thing)

A $10 12 oz NY steak? When you hear that, I know you're thinking \"this has got to be some Taco Bell, Grade F beef\"... well, that's what I thought when I drove past. But after a friend convinced me to come here, I can tell you, it's definitely not. You get a quality steak (they have a ton of choices, NY, Rib, Porterhouse, T-bone, etc.) or chicken, smoked ribs, pulled pork, or even soulvaki for a great price.

I had a 12 oz Rib steak + baby back ribs with fries and a draft beer for $22 all in. Seriously. 

The steak was cooked to my liking (rare) and they cooked it perfectly.  The steak doesn't have much seasoning on it, but you can add bbq sauce or pepper to it if you want.  I wouldn't say \"Keg quality\" like other posts, but the cook knows his stuff, and the meat is good.  The ribs were also pretty tasty and tender.  

You can also get a 12 oz draft beer for $2.10, I don't know how you can beat that. 

They have a pretty wide array of menu items (makes me wonder how they stock/prepare all these meats, and if they have enough turnover to get through their smoked meats) and I'll definitely be back to try some other items, such as a pulled pork sandwich with fries for $6.99, Beef ribs with a side for $11, Del Monico steak (on special) with a side for $12. 

If you're in the area and you have a carnivore craving and don't mind a diner type setting, I'd suggest it.

UPDATE:
I tried the Del Monaco steak + fries + onion rings. They won't let you sub fries for onion rings (you can only sub fries for salad), so I just got it as an additional side.  

I don't like the cut of the Del Monaco, they charge more for it, but it's a thinner cut so I'd stick with the rib eye. The fries are good here, but I'd pass on the onion rings as well. Cheap for $2.50, but they use a thick batter so it's very doughy. Stick with the fries!"}

The steak is just plain grilled and some parts were burnt I was expecting more love to be done especially on a such big cut and I'm judging this place based on what I ordered not how it looks. I was expecting the steak to be butter basted with rosemary but the quality wasn't there at all some minor sections on my steak were well done even though I asked for medium for my side I had the smashed potato which was good and it also came with a small garden salad and that was my first and last time of going there."}

This is the only place that you can go to for a steak and have that much selection for the price.  For those that have been you know how large the menu actually is.  Although the steaks might not be AAA Angus or top notch meat but it is deff worth every penny.

All and all I have been here more than 10 times and each time there has NEVER been a problem and was very satisfied with the taste of the food and the service."}
{"text":"Master Steaks is a trucker stop style self serve diner located in Mississauga that specializes in steaks, that has been around forever. It's always had a reputation as a place where you could get no frills affordable steaks.

You place an order at the counter, pay your bill and you're given a number. When your order is ready, they call your number and you get your food and seat yourself. I decided on a lunch special which was a medium rare 12 oz rib eye steak with a choice of a side for $15.99 plus tax. I decided to go with a side order of french fries.

The 12 oz rib eye steak was cooked accordingly, decent seasoning and was okay without steak sauce. if your steak needs steak sauce to taste good, it's not a good steak. A decent steak shouldn't need any steak sauce. At the same time, it wasn't a great cut or 40 day aged fancy marbled steak but it was reasonable for the price I paid. Decent amount of fat and wasn't that tender but not that tough at the same time. The french fries were pretty standard.

If you are looking for a quick affordable no frills steak in the airport area of Mississauga, Master Steaks is a decent choice but if you are looking for a fancy steak in a nice formal restaurant environment then Master Steaks isn't what you are looking for."}

I had the chicken special with cheese and bacon and a side order of fries my co worker had a burger with a side order of fries and gravy and will not forget to mention we both got bottles of pepsi and it was all for 24 bucks can't go wrong.  will be back soon oh yes I will!!"}
{"text":"Great place to have an affordable steak.  All the sides are amazing, the fries, the mashed potatoes, the gravy and onion rings are old fashioned and home made.  The staff has gotten a lot friendlier since last I was here. All smiles while taking my order, I totally didn't expect that.  The venue itself is not so nice and clean :(, they really need to pay attention to that.

The steak is freshly grilled and you can see fire go up as the griller puts a new steak on.  T-bones are good, but really gotta be careful with the rib steak.  I've had some good ones and some super chewy ones.  Today, I asked for medium and my steak came rare plus.  Not perfect grilling, if you ask for a medium expect a medium rare to medium well.

I like this place but they need to keep the venue a little cleaner. So I give it a 3.5.  I've been here when it was cleaner, so I'll just put a four star on account of previous, better visits."}
{"text":"I had to check out west-ends version of T-Bones.  Master Steaks definitely has glimpses of the east-end equivalent.  Simple seasoned, preparation of various cuts of Steaks grilled to your choice of doneness with selection of sides.   3.5 *Star*

As affordable as they come as long as you aren't choosey on the cleaniness or grundgeyness of the dining space.  Master Steak has the Trucker crowd as it's near Motels and Gas Stations which is the difference to T-Bones customer base.

Weird how the booth seating felt quite narrow fit at the belly level but no worries, you can find other seats that'll fit Beer Bellies or Steak Bellies.  Remember to bring your DATE here if she is really into you, kiddin.   :P

16oz NY Steak with Baked Potatoes and Salad ($16.99)

Steak slight overdone to order but still delicious.  Most surprising was the Baked Potatoes reminds me of German Potato Salad \"Kartoffelsalat\" with Vinegar base dressing, cool.  Last place I would think to find such a side option."}
{"text":"This place used to be a go to for me as the portions are generous and prices are decent. It started going downhill a while ago which didn't bother me much as long as the prices stayed the same and the food was still good which it was for a while but not for long. I drew the line when I found a small cockroach or cockroach like insect in my food at first I thought it was problem just a chunky piece of gravy from the fries then it started to move :o I was in shock I had been munching away at my food till that point until that horrifying moment. It seemed like it was cooked with the food and just barely alive since it was brown crusty and moving its leg very slow. I got up showed it to the lady working there she looked at it for a while then agreed with no expression on her face... so I'm guessing this kind of thing happens often there. So while I try not to puke before I could ask for my money back so I can get out of there as fast as I can she tells the chef to put another one on. So I just sat back at my seat trying to process the whole situation in my head. Then they call me up for the replacement order and the steak was burnt and hard when the first one was tender and tasty were they mad at me cuz I found a bug in my food which was totally their fault? Anyway I took a few bites but the steak wasn't edible so I left. I guess I understand now why their food was a few dollars less than steak houses when it comes to cleanliness and sanitary food you get what you pay for. I wonder where else they may be cutting costs. I would much rather pay a little more for good food and good service. This place seems to be inclined to serve the lower rung of society, but what can I say it is a real dive... 

They also tell their staff to give the place good reviews. I wonder how much they pay the health inspector not to shut the place down."}
{"text":"Food is still great but the service has gone done hill. Just took me 24 minutes to get my lunch.  Steak with a salad, that is ALL. They don't have enough people working and this has been the same for the last 4 visits.  It is 12:30 on a Friday and EVERY table is dirty."}
{"text":"Had to be the worst steak I have ever eaten. No seasoning and the place was so dirty it should have been shut down.

Will never return."}

I came here for lunch with a friend, and was not impressed.

It is like a fast food set-up where you go and order at the counter, and they make your food on the spot while you wait.  You can then bring your food to any table to eat.
The service wasn't great.  The person at the register was not friendly, and a bit rude.  One of the workers was arguing with a customer next to me, which didn't help the atmosphere.

When I got my food, it was super greasy, and I found a hair on my plate!  GROSS

I can say, I am not going back."}

If this would have happened to me in my home country I would have sent the steak back and left the restaurant without paying a cent but since I'am a foreigner and I had to pay up front I ate what I could and left."}

It's a throw back place. No frills diner / truck stop vibe. But food was good and prices to match. Excellent for what it is."}
{"text":"Hubby was in the mood for steak and since we happened to be in Mississauga it was a no-brainer; Master Steaks here we come! We could smell the aroma of grilled meats as we entered the parking lot; it was gonna be a good night!

Last time we took our order to go but this time we decided to dine in. This old diner is in desperate need of a facelift but that has no bearing on the quality of the food. We placed our order with the friendly cashier then sat down at one of the booths to wait for our number to be called.

From the looks of the picture menu, last time we were here we actually had the Delmonico steak. Today we're trying the Rib steak with a side of veggies, roasted potatoes and a Caesar salad ($0.99 extra for the upgrade). Since the steak sauce came in such little containers we asked for another one; they were nice enough not to charge us extra.

Our steak turned out beautifully; it was nicely seared on all sides with grill marks and a little bit of char around the edges. It was cooked perfectly even though it was a thick slab of meat. The steak was juicy and tender. The Delmonico was more tender than the rib steak but the rib steak was more flavorful than the Delmonico.

Took away a star because I still haven't found good enough sides to go with the steak. The cooked veggies (broccoli, cauliflower and carrots) were overcooked, I didn't like the taste of the roasted potatoes however the Caesar salad was decent once I took off the stale croutons (they top it with Bacos if that makes a difference to anyone).

This is the only place we're coming to if we want steak; the trek from East York to Mississauga is totally worth it. The fact that it's open till the wee hours of the morning is also a BIG draw for us dedicated meat eaters."}
{"text":"If you are over 40, this place is a pleasent throwback to a time when this setup was common. 
Old booths, order your food and take a seat while they prepare and call your number. 
The food is good, prices a bit high. 
No frills, no wait staff (prefer that)."}
{"text":"Well I posted a review about this place actually a pretty good review ...saying how it's got great steaks at fantastic prices ....but the owner or whoever complained to.yelp and had my post removed lol guess they don't like good reviews .
It said I might have the wrong establishment , because I said it's like a truck stop ....There is nothing wrong with truck stops just so you know ...truckers are hard working men and woman who love great Food at fair prices . And all I said was this place is along dixie road near the 401 by a truck stop gas station so it feels like your on the road in a truck stop but get great food at fair prices and definitely check them out ...
So.if this gets removed again well there's discrimination for truckers from this place . I sure hope they change there mind and accept all good reviews cause I like this place alot ."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Never going here again. Ordered a 12oz chicken breast. Got my plate 45 mins later. 45 mins! People behind me were getting served first.  About 8-10 people got their order before me.  The cook kept looking at my order and serving other people. When he realized he handed me the  wrong plate,  he called me back to dump the  plate and  continued to see the other customers, I was fuc*ing pissed. When I got the  correct plate,  the food was already cold and never got an apology. I never bothered to speak to the manager as it was more of a waste of my time. Be warned stay away from this place. No customer service whatsoever. Zet's is soooo much better."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and passed by it many times. Thought I would check it out to see what it's like. I was quite satisfied. 

They have a great variety of steaks: New York, rib, T-bone, etc. Unlike other steak restaurants, it's not geared toward the more upscale diner but rather average folks who like a decent steak dinner without paying the typical steakhouse prices. It's really a nice, laid back family restaurant. 

As for the steaks, they can be big! Most places only offer 8 or 12 oz. steaks, but here you can get 16 or even 24 oz. steaks, and for less than $30. I myself ordered a 16 oz. New York steak, which included French fries, vegetables, and a salad, for only $17.99. With a Pepsi and including taxes, the bill came to $22 or so. I ordered the steak done medium-well, although it was probably closer to medium when I got it. I suppose that's understandable when you consider how thick the steak was, which is why I won't really complain if it was slightly underdone. The taste was very good, like a nice homemade steak. 

If you like a nice family restaurant and you grew up eating lots of beef like I did, you may want to check this little place out. Very affordable and friendly."}
{"text":"Keg quality steaks at a way cheaper price. 

Right off the 401 this place is a definite truck stop or dive so to speak. Going into the place it looks like some bombed the place. The seats were uncomfortable there were trays still at the tables with left overs, its like no one cleaned up around there. 

Besides the interior being an absolute dump, which kinda turns you off from eating there, the food is really good. The steaks are very well done, made to order, seasoned just right, even if they didn't put any seasoning of the steaks the steak would still be great! The salad tasted very fresh and crisp and the fries were pretty good, although I did have some that were a little oily. 

If I were to go back I would only get the steak for take out b/c eating there is a real turn off. 

Items to definitely get 

- 12oz tbone 
- 12oz NY"}
{"text":"Steaks juicy but not much flavour.
No salt or pepper on table. Maybe up front. 
Steak sauce is very good, buy extra. 

Vegetables are boiled and flavourless.
Think 1960's American military cafeteria.

Roast potatoes were pretty weak. Next time would get fries with gravy. 

Tried fried mushrooms but were very flavourless. Again no salt or butter or flavour. 

No air conditioning but not too hot. 

Place is good tho. Price is low for solid healthy real food."}
{"text":"Truck stop steak house, nothing fancy, line up at the counter, place your order, pay, get a number, wait for your number to be called, get your order at the counter.  Been here a few times, and look forward to coming here for some of their food when we're in the vicinity.  It's a rather extensive menu on their wall, also will sell meats packaged to go, as on your flight out.  It's meats are not full of gristle and a good eating place for meat lovers with a car.  The atmosphere isn't anything fancy, the food quality is very good, nicely seasoned.  We ordered one meal a ribeye steak rare with ribs and french fries and split it for two.  They serve beer also, credit or debit cards accepted, opens 6am, closes 3am.  Came back the next morning for Delmonico steak rare and eggs breakfast, but forgot to order smoked meat sandwiches for our flight out.  I like seeing the older guy at night taking our orders behind the counter, been there over 30 years; it's a bit like nostalgia.  The food tastes very good, prices are reasonable.  Thinking about this place almost makes me want to salivate.  Yum."}
{"text":"Master steak provides affordable steaks for the family. It is a truck dinner without any frills but their meats are grilled well. Their steaks are cooked to medium rare and their chicken souvlaki is juicy. Their pork souvlaki was a bit dry when I had it on another occasion. Their sides however are not flavorful and remind me of cafeteria food I've tried their roasted potatoes (which were boiled), fries and salad. They are friendly and have a clean environment. If you are looking for affordable steak in Missisauga, check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss for me, I love steak but the I always pick Medium but lately my Medium request have been looking Medium on the outer parts of my steak and rare to blue in the middle. Very disappointing. The chef is not consistent with the way I like my steaks cooked.
The potatoes are nothing to brag about and the Rice is dry. Salad is ok too.

The only pros I would give is that the interior has been upgraded! Looks nice and cleaner than before."}
{"text":"I am totally a fan of the prices here. 12.99 for a 16oz NY steak? Hollaa! Well, I tried the delmonaco steak for $18 (with sides and tax) though... but still pretty darned good. I was expecting cheap steak, cooked from frozen and probably not medium-rare as I asked. What I got, however:

Steak cooked medium rare to perfection, not from frozen (still pink on the inside), good amount of fat marbling... yum. Served on a cheap plate with not the greatest sides, but I could care less. 

What you need to know before going to Master Steaks?

1. Kind of a dive... serious no-no for a first date.
2. Good cheap steak... but please don't expect The Keg on a platter.
3. No filet mignon. 

Ankie Tip? Salad is a plus $1.99 ... skip it. It's quarter of lettuce, 1 slimy tomato with whatever seasoning. I highly recommend the rice side though. The potatoes looked good as well.

Verdict? I am going back for more."}
{"text":"This is my first review...the service was so horrible I could not control the urge to post a review about this place I ordered the 12oz Rib steak (medium well) with extra crispy fries, gravy, onion rings, and a Coke which came to a fair price of about $30 *please note I mentioned extra crispy fries three times* while he was plating my food I immediately noticed he gave me the same fries as everyone else not extra crispy like I ordered however I decided it was not worth the hassle to bring it up after my first taste of the steak I immediately noticed how under seasoned and thin it was but my biggest concern was how they over cooked it I clearly ordered medium well which should show some pink as you can see in the picture this was definitely over cooked but I do understand mistakes happen so I politely asked them to remedy the situation I also mentioned the fries what got me really upset is when the polite waitress told who I believe to be the owner he argued with me and tried to educate me on what a medium well steak should look like he even had the audacity to cut my steak in the middle to try to prove his point( even though I cut into it before sending it back) and please note he is doing all of this in an incredibly rude and argumentative manner yelpers can be the judge if this steak was over cooked as I posted a picture of it I have been to many steak houses and restaurants some best in the world including the legendary gallaghers steak house in Manhattan and cafe 440 on rodeo drive in Beverly Hills never have I seen a medium well like this nor have I ever witnessed this kind of service at the end he dis-agreed to make me a new steak but would remedy the fries situation and keep my steak warm for me until the fries were done only when the food retuned the steak was room temp and the fries were fresh but even less crispy than the first time around"}
{"text":"Master Steaks has seriously run-down decor, zero ambiance, very friendly cashier, self-serve services, good quality steak and exceptional value.

Our steaks were good.  The meat was tender; it was seasoned; the meat texture was good.  It felt good chewing the meat!  It was, however, not cooked properly.  I ordered rare doneness, and the steak turned out to be blue to rare.  My BF ordered medium doneness, and the steak was medium rare to medium well.  I suspect that the heat of grill is not even.  Overall, the grill did not make the steaks perfect, but it didn't totally ruin them.  Just in case they would overcook your steak, I would suggest ordering on the rarer side of your preference.

The pricing was unbelievably low.  A 12 oz Delmonico steak with mashed potato was $13.99, a 12 oz prime rib with roasted potatoes was $16.99, a side lettuce salad was $1.99 and domestic beer costed $4.  The side salad was fresh, but it didn't worth the price.  I would suggest to skip it when the cashier takes your order.  They have other steak specials for T-bone steaks, rib steaks, lamb chops, etc..  

The ambiance was shockingly bad.  My BF literally halted his steps at the door until I pushed my way through.  Sure they could have used better light bulbs, right?  A coat of paint would be really nice, but I got the feeling that it was wishful thinking.

Since I like my steak, and the value blows me away, Master Steaks earns a 4-star rating on my book.  If you care about the ambiance, it is a 1-star restaurant, though.  This is a place where you dine with people who won't judge you for eating there, such as your family and your long-term friends.  

Oh yeah, I will come back for steak."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fancy-free brand-free Steak House! I remember the first time I came here was in summer of 1995 and the place still looks the same. Same order process, same menu, and same decor - I love it.

Refer to the photos for the menu and prices.  

I met a friend for lunch today and had the 16oz New York Steak with sides (see photo). It was fantastic!

You see truckers, group, couples, and families. The place has great Steaks, (Rib, T-bone, New York, Delmonico), Ribs, Fish, Chicken, Burgers, Salads, JUMBO Shrimps, and sandwiches.  

They have tables, banquettes, and there's an ATM.

Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for steaks, I mean it's nothing like The Keg but what do you expect at 2am? For the price the servings are pretty good and it'll leave you satisfied. Service is also remarkably good, something that surprised me for the time and type of place this is; I'd just try and avoid this place during Friday/Saturday nights as it can get pretty \"rough\" there. Other than that a solid place for steaks, souvlaki, and burgers!"}

Always always always preferred ZET restaurant i dont know why i went and spent this much on nothing. Not going back again"}
{"text":"Cheap Steaks, and good taste, I mean you can't go wrong. 

This place has souvlakis, burgers, salads, fries....its a grill place. Most people come here for the cheap steaks, t-bone, sirloin you got it! 

the foods great, cheap for the good quality food you get, fast service, and its open really late....oh and if your craving all-day breakfast, this is the place to be at!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend. Came here for lunch. Ordered a 12 ounce n.y steak. Asked for medium rare and got a well done. Not sure how you go from medium rare to well done (extremes to me). I can understand ordering a medium rare and getting medium or medium well. Worst steak I've had in a while. Lady at the cash was rude too, she even confirmed with me that I wanted medium rare. Oh well, won't be coming here again, nor will anyone at my company. Other than that, wasn't expecting much, I have low expectations and eat just about anything. Sounds like others had a better experience."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Good salty gravy. Fantastic people watching. This place is a little out of the way. A little run down. A little sketchy but it's fun as hell and the food is good. Also great steaks. Can't beat it."}

{"text":"One of the last and incredibly delicious roadhouse diners left...

Located just off the 401, north on Dixie rd, this is my go to place for delicious steaks, burgers and souvlaki 
The decor is a little dated and run down but considering it's a truck stop style roadside diner it's right on point. Always super busy with fast, efficient and friendly service these guys specialize in affordable steaks and grilled foods; everything from they're rib, ny and Delmonico steaks to onion rings, Caesar salads, burgers and fish n chips I have never been disappointed and always come back for more.

Staff is always friendly and knowledgable delivering consistent quality and service. 
The layout is spacious with plenty of tables and booth seating so it's usually easy to find a table.
Attached to the diner is a little, cozy bar that offers a variety if beers on tap and delicious wings just a few steps away from the diner.

The hrs are convenient staying open most days till midnight; located right off the highway with a private large parking lot this diner is def one of my fav of it's kind... And prob one of the last of a dying breed 

I highly recommend this place to steak lovers everywhere it certainly is worth the trip ;)"}
{"text":"Had the 16z steak great cook exactly how I like it veg fresh no taste mash potatoes with gravy ok but need to be more hot overall I would go back just for the steak the staff is friendly and Great"}
{"text":"For a 9.99 chopsteak I thought \"hey you can't go wrong\". It was wrong. Overcooked and dry as hell, I couldn't even finish it. Not to mention the new employee was really rude considering she still looked like she was training. The other one was good. Regardless, I have no interest coming back here for the chopsteak which was basically a burger with no bun that took 30 minutes to make. I might come back if it's convenient and to try something else."}
{"text":"Been coming to master steaks for over 13 years.  This spot had its golden days in the 90's until the huffy trucker spot opened up next door, drawing most truckers over there.  This was the place to pop by after a night clubbing and get yourself a nice filling meal to stick to your ribs and soak up the alcohol in your system.  Also the area is Mississauga's industrial zone, many manufacturing businesses, auto mechanics and blue collar industries close by and you'll see a lot of the locals who work close by drop by for lunch, a friendly crowd.  The restaurant is attached to a bar called Angie's that's been running as long as master steaks also.  Food here is good, its nothing jaw dropping but its still good and that's respectable.  These guys have been doing steaks for a long time and whatever you end up getting you're sure to like it for what it is, and if you gawk at it, take a look at yourself in the mirror and visit a third world country you softie.  You're blessed and privileged to be eating at the masters."}
{"text":"Love this place! I lived about 20 minutes away when I was younger so I was a semi-regular, but now I'm about 90 minutes away, so it's only if I'm in the area. The place is very no frills and decor is old, but the food is always good. The burgers are really good, but I especially love the Delmonico steak. Fries are fresh cut, onion rings are homemade thick cut beer battered. The steak sauce is made in house and AMAZING! I love it with my fries! Stopped in last night about midnight and had a Delmonico and ordered it medium - it was definitely medium rare, but still good. Fries and gravy weren't as hot as I expected, but still good. The food is fresh and very tasty and steaks and burgers are flame grilled when you order. I heard years ago that they bring their beef in from Alberta and age and cut it in house. It's one of my favourite places to eat and I try to stop in when I'm going past on the 401. Reasonably priced steaks that are tender and I've never been disappointed! As a side note, another customer sitting close by had the open face hot beef and swears it's the best thing there - the beef was really stacked and smothered in gravy - looked awesome! Will definitely have to try it! Reason for the 4 stars even though it wasn't perfect is because the food is fresh and real - not frozen crap and is always tasty. No place is perfect all the time, right?"}
{"text":"Yummy great selection and quick place to grab a bite love that you can just leave your dirty dishes on the table like you did when you where a kid for mom to clean up 
Truck stop food with no trucks"}
{"text":"This place needs an update with their decor. Other than that, food prices are cheap, but the sides are going to rip you off. 

Your order for example would include mashed potatoes, but you gotta add $1 for gravy. If you want fried onions on your food, another $1 and if you want mushrooms, another $2. So a simple $19 meal instantly turned into $26. What a joke.

PLUS, steak is flavourless and overcooked! I ORDERED MEDIUM RARE BUT INSTEAD I GOT WELL-DONE. Way to ruin our dinner. I guess you get what you pay for.


Might as well go to known steakhouses for quality. NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"That place is getting worse and worse.Ive been coming there on and off for the last 15 years.Last week ordered a 16 inch Delmonico steak with extra mushrooms and onions.When I got it the stake was covered with mushrooms and onions,so I could not see what was under.As I started working on my \"steak\" I noticed that half of it was fat.Basically I have paid for the whole steak and only got half of it.I noticed before that quality was down,but nothing like that.The whole meal costed me $38 .What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Came here with my steak loving friend recently. 

Upon entry, you will likely want to turn around and leave. The decor is a little bit like a large donut shop, cheap chairs and tables and a few booths, obviously hasn't been remodeled in 2 decades. Dining space is quite grungy - out of the 20 or so tables, 2 were occupied, 3 were clean, and the other 10 had dirty trays and plates left that the cleaning staff had not yet cleared. (It was taken care of as we were sitting down, but obviously it is not a top priority here)

You come here only for the amazing prices. I had a very large meal consisting of a 12oz strip loin topped with grilled onions and mushrooms, an 8oz grilled chicken breast, some Greek lemony potatoes and a side salad for around $18. We also had some amazing giant tiger shrimps, a whole pound for around $12. 

I think they quality here is inconsistent. My friend was disappointed with his steak, he ordered medium and it was cooked so thoroughly he said it tasted like leather. Mine, on the other hand, ordered medium-rare, came out medium-well but was still quite tasty.

It's open very late (4am) so it's a great choice for late night cheap eats. Otherwise I can't see why I would return here."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The lady taking my order explained to me what the most popular items were weather I was looking for chicken, steak, or both

The order came out within 10minutes. I got both the steak and chicken and both were cooked perfectly, I mean perfectlyyy. The food was fresh and was well worth it. I'd go back in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"Great food the ribs were excellent  and I've had steaks there before and found the food is VERY good and the staff very friendly,trucking from Edmonton I'm on my way back again see you guys in 2 days"}
{"text":"truck stop: big a$$ steaks, big a$$ shrimps,good value,  greassy floors, dont take your first date here! also potential for gout."}
{"text":"I went here recently and it seems the place has changed quite a lot. The food is alright, the ribs are a bit more dry so you might want to ask for extra BBQ sauce. The prices aren't as great as they used to be and some menu boards were altered/missing. The service was pretty bad as there was a lot of miscommunication with orders, and yelling between the staff. I'll pop by when I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Master Steak! Master Steak! When I asked my yelp buddy where he has to visit on our A Day of Mississauga outing.. that's all he kept saying..  OK, Master Steak here we come!

8oz/10oz/12oz/16oz - TBone/NY Steak - Baked Potatoes/French Fries -  Well Done/Medium/Medium Rare/Rare.. choices and more choices... decisions and more decisions. That older lady at the cashier kept giving me pressure to make all these decisions!

16oz NY Steak cooked Medium Rare with Baked Potatoes and Salad ($16.99)
- 16oz fresh off the grill steak! Medium Rare is a little dry..since the steak was almost cooked through with just a hint of pink..so Rare might be a better choice 

Come to Master Steak for the food if you are a meat lover!! 

Cheap, Simple, Down to Earth both in their food and their decorations and even their patrons. Truckers are nice people... and sometimes they are a lot nicer and polite than some of the drunk people I met in a club...

Don't ever bring your date here until you certain that she is really into you... if not, she might never willing to go out with you again! :)"}
{"text":"No need to go to high end steak houses. Master steaks does your stomach and your wallet good. Great cuts of steaks cooked perfectly to your liking with just the right amount if sides. Without breaking the bank. 

This place can look like a dive bar from the outside, may even be mistaken for a truck stop, but once you get closer and get inside, a display of the different steaks they have welcome you. Place is very clean, not even a hint of smoke can be seen or smelled while you enjoy your dinner. Truly a great place for great food in the west end."}

REALLY??? i paid $23 for a chewy prime rib with some soggy veggies and dried mash potato, and you gonna charged me a dollar more for the gravy??? the place look old, dated, and not clean, it has a certain smell to it, i wish i went somewhere else, or even stayed at my hotel for room service with better food!!!"}
{"text":"My love for yelp deepens every time I stumble upon a hidden-treasure restaurant like Master Steaks.

We decided to get a protein filled breakfast and stopped by on Sunday. After reading the reviews I wasn't surprised when their were trucks alongside cars in the parking lot. 

I ordered the 8oz steak which came with two eggs, home fries and toast. Grand total for two of these meals plus two coffees = $26.70. What a steal!!!!!

The steaks were great. They weren't too seasoned but cooked perfectly. 
Eggs were good but who goes wrong on eggs.. 
The home fries were okay, just a little cold. 

Overall the value of this place amazes me. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a dive with a smile.  If you have an appetite and diet is not the first thing on your mind, you will not be disappointed.  You have choices that are heavy steak based (obviously) but throw in shrimp, souvlaki, salmon steak chicken fingers (with a peach sauce) and great high carb extras and you got yourself a good night.  Meals are 7.99 to 15.99 and even some cheaper options on a la carte sandwiches.

This place is very cafeteria, made to order style with no waiter/waitress service.  

There is even a bar on the side if you just want to have a cold one and relax with good company.   Whether it is a night out with buddies or a family meal this is a good, easy stop."}
{"text":"Agree with all previous reviews! This is a classic Mississauga dive!

A total truckers stop. Open late, great for cheap but large portioned meats, diner-style breakfast, poutine, souvlaki.

It's an order-at-the-counter type joint, so no wait service."}
{"text":"Straight up, you get what you pay for. Don't expect a $20 t bone to be anymore than a $20 t bone...

Went with family so I had a chance to try the overcooked medium rare steak, dry ribs, bland veggies and overcooked rice. At these prices you're better off going to zets, you know what you're getting when you go there. 

The only saving grace was the pork souvlaki was decent and for $10 for the combo you can really go wrong. 

But the fries......the fries were amazing! Super crispy on the outside with a nice soft pillowy potato inside. Best part of the meal by far. 

Would not go back."}
{"text":"I was expecting the place to be run down and unfriendly so that was fine with me.  The steak was just okay, baby back ribs were disgusting. I've had better food from fast food places actually.  Very disappointed."}
