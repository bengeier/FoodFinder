{"text":"Thus place may seem small, but their flavor is huge. A little out of the way but totally worth it. Chicken tacos on point."}
{"text":"We loved Sonora Taco Shop!  Went mid afternoon and got a table easily. It is small, but they seem to do a good takeout business. Tried the grilled asada(STS has won \"Best Asada\" from New Times Best of Phoenix), grilled chicken, and pastor tacos as well as a chicken caramelo and each was delicious.  Beans were tasty with plenty of cheese thrown on.  Wish we would've asked the Owner/Manager's(?) name.  He asked how we liked the food and I think he knew what our answer would be before we even sat down: \"Awesome!\"...  We plan on visiting again our next time in Phoenix, for sure. Thank you STS!"}
{"text":"Authentic Carne Esada Tacos...We were the only ones in the place and it was amazing. Only thing that woulve been better is a Corona to wash it down. I could eat 100 of those tacos."}
{"text":"Best street tacos in the state and sooo close to the Suns and Dbax game. a must pre game dinner. much less than anything at the stadium and so much more flavor.

A must...."}
{"text":"Being a self proclaimed street taco virtuoso and making it a personal mission to try tacos at a different restaurant every Tuesday for \"Taco Tuesday\", I must say that this place has been the best that Phoenix has to offer so far. The menu is limited, but I honestly wouldn't change it because everything on it is delicious. The service was also fantastic, the owner himself did all the cooking and serving and was very personable. 

The location could be improved, but the sense of danger adds to the \"Taco Tuesday\" experience. 

Only thing I would say is that the dining area needed to be cleaned a little and you guys definitely need a website so more people can find your place and eat delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday just after lunch rush.  My plan was to try everything on the menu.  As there are only 3 items on the menu, this was not a stretch.  They have carne asada tacos, Vampiros and quesadillas.  But, I was surprised to learn that they ran out of vampiros and quesadillas so the only thing I could order was the carne asada taco.  Not a huge issue but I was a little surprised by that so I dock them 1 star.

I ordered 3 tacos.  They were very, very good.  I really enjoyed these tacos.  Not sure if they raised the bar on carne asada in Phoenix but these were really tasty. Not at all greasy in any way and they had a  very beefy flavor. I didn't get full on the 3 tacos I ordered, but at only $1.50 each, I will order more next time.

Salsa were good, not great.  The salsa bar consists of thinly sliced cabbage, cucumbers, radishes, salsa de aguacate (the thin guacamole used on carne asada tacos), salsa roja and a salsa very similiar to salsa de molcajete.  A decent selection.  Most selections were near empty when I arrived but since I arrived at the end of the lunch rush, they probably didn't yet have an opportunity to restock.

Lastly, the girl working the cash register was very beautiful and very friendly, greeting each customer with a smile.  Very enjoyable experience here.

I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed. Excellent carne asada! And fast too like a good taco shop should be. Delicious and not pricey. Sure they aren't at a Mexico price, but we gotta remember here in the states it is different. It costs these guys a lot to have a restaurante here, so that being said the price is really not bad. Less than $2 for an asada taco?! Don't be cheap this is real grilled steak nothing prepackaged or processed and real homemade tortillas and salsa. 
Feed you inner Mexican and give this shop a try!"}
{"text":"No chips, burritos are small, salsas aren't hot and lack flavor, carne asada has no flavor. Anyone who gives the place more then 3 stars has never had good Mexican food. However, the place looks cool tho."}
{"text":"These tacos are pretty good but pricey $$$ and it was a very small if you like a big meal I did not record this place"}
{"text":"Great place, simple classic tacos."}
{"text":"Food is average, seating is very limited. Standing logs for chairs outside? Not cool looking or remotely comfortable. If I go back, it'd be for carry out. Don't go on a windy day and sit outside;  your styrofoam plate will blow away and the person it hits may or may not be a d-bag about it. We had to sit outside with a party of more than 3, and there is only a single picnic table out front, which we were lucky to get."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! 
This taco shop is located in a questionable area but it's truly a gem and easily the best taco shop I've been too! 
EVERYTHING is fresh and absolutely delicious! 
My family and I tried everything except for the vampiros. The meat was so juicy and tasty and the homemade tortillas were stellar. 
The service was great! A definite place to swing by if you're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great Flavor but won't be back. 

I got one of each of the three tacos. They all had really great flavor, no question. The four tortillas were great as advertised and the salsa/ topping bar was varied and very good. 

The bad: the tacos should be no more than $1.50. They're now $1.99. No taco Tuesday discounts. Also the pastor taco was full of rock hard bone or cartilage. 

Like I said, tasty and I hope it does well but $2 is too much for tiny street tacos especially when so much of the pastor was non-edible non-meat"}
{"text":"I have the luxury of owning a business within walking distance of this place. We can't stop eating there. It's like carne asada addiction. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  If you are in the area you should absolutely stop by.  The carne asada tacos are fantastic.  The menu is small, the drink selection is minimal and they do it all right.  3 items on the menu: Tacos, Vampiros, Quesadillas!  Will absolutely be back to this place."}
{"text":"Simple menu, great eats! Sonoran Grill is a nice lil'joint for some quick street tacos at a reasonable price. Parking is a bit cramped along with indoor seating but plenty of outdoor seating available. Staff was also very pleasant. I look forward to coming back. Came here before when it was another type of eatery and was disappointed. Today was looking for something new in the area close to work and Yelp had some high star reviews. Decided to revisit the location and happy we did."}
{"text":"Best tacos this side of the Mississippi. Tacos are awesome and thw salsas they offer only make them that much better. 

Meet is always fresh and consistent in flavor. 

Great Place near downtown Phoenix.."}
{"text":"Being from Hermosillo, Sonora myself, this is the closest to true Sonoran carne asada tacos you can get.  The tacos are al carbon style, so they use real charcoal.  Ask for flour tortillas with yours.

The place is very small with only a few things on the menu.  But their carne asada tacos are absolutely the best thing on the menu.   4 will fill you up and they're only $1.50 each!

Also, great friendly service and nice selection of salsas at the salsa bar.  My favorite is the roasted salsa.

 I've hunted all over Phoenix trying to find a great Sonoran carne asada taco.  I guess I found my place."}
{"text":"On our way home on the 60 freeway got hungry so I decided to stop for a quick bite. Driving toward downtown on 7th St hoping to find something I spotted this hole in the wall taco place and I'm glad I went with my gut instinct to stop and check it out.

This place is everything you would expect from an authentic Sonoran style taco. If you've never had Sonoran style tacos you should know they're known for using flour tortillas instead of corn. You will find this in very few regions in Mexico. 

The chicken was very tasty and tastes as if it was done rotisserie style. Their Asada was also pretty flavorful and they have a great selection of salsas. Will definitely come back here when I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing! Fresh, Fresh, Fresh.  Small restaurant and very small menu - but everything on it is great. All tacos are carne asada. They also serve Mexican coke and sprite. Parking lot is rather small, but doesn't seem to pose any issues. Tacos are worth it though! Will definitely be coming back soon! The owner was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Delicious. The chicken and pork were exceptional.  Nice quick bite to eat by the airport."}
{"text":"The great reviews are HIGHLY MISLEADING.  The carne asada is ok. The caramelos are very small and the service is subpar. Many of the salsa containers were empty and they did not care. One was actually frozen. I asked whether they had more onions before I ordered, they said yes.  The onion they brought out had very little lime and so much salt it was inedible. Even after putting the onions out, nobody refilled the salsas.  I ordered beans with my caramelo, never came out. Overall a bad experience. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We tried everything on the menu all three items.  My wife and kids and I loved every bite.  Great salsa and sides to put on your tacos.  Simple flavorful beef and great corn and flour tortillas.  I will go back on our way back to the airport at the end of the trip."}
{"text":"A legit street taco experience with the best al pastor I've had. Well worth the stop for their tasty and nicely priced food."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town and this place rocks! I had to go back for a second order. Great authentic food for a fabulous price."}
{"text":"Small place and menu but the carne asada was amazing!! Best I've had in downtown phx area!! The staff were very friendly and helped get salsa for my large order! Will be picking up dinner here more often."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix. The pork tacos are on point. Definitely worth the trip to the south side."}
{"text":"Flavorful meats and great salsas. Inexpensive. Everything a taco shop should be."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a better rating, but...

After paying with a credit card and reviewing the receipt, I noticed a surcharge for paying with credit.  I wouldn't have minded this, except that I wasn't told about it before paying, nor was anyone else, nor is there any sign to let you know.  And when I asked them to void the transaction so I could use cash instead, nobody was able to do this pretty simple task.  Just not right.

So, good tacos, but watch the receipt."}
{"text":"For the price, the flavor and the serving size a delight!  On or way to full the rental car tank near Sky Harbor Airport,  we found this treasure. Crispy corn tortillas, thin flour tortillas and savory carne asada were topped with fresh ingredients of our choice. THIS was the meal I'd been waiting for on a trip to Arizona from the Twin Cities!"}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall taco place with very little seating or parking.  Had multiple street tacos, very tasty.  The toppings were very fresh and flavorful.  My main complaint about this place is their limited menu.  You guys needs to add fish or squash, something.  My wife is a pescatarian, so she wasn't happy with all the meat options and nothing for her but a bean burrito."}
{"text":"Very good tacos. Very true Mexican style tacos. Flavor is great sizes are good. Pretty fast over all. The only downside to this place is that it is very small inside. That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  Otherwise  very good!"}
{"text":"Very simple but delicious carne asada, just meat and tortillas with a topping bar that includes radishes, cabbage, onions and various salsas. Well cooked and great flavor in the meat plus it's very affordable"}
{"text":"Nice taco spot if you are in the mood for some street tacos. I only eat chicken so that's the only meat I tried. I had 2 tacos and a vampiro. The portions were a good size for the price. A vampiro is a tostada with your choice of meat. I liked their topping and salsa bar. All the ingredients were super fresh and I got to add all the lettuce and pickled onions I wanted! They had varying levels of spice for the salsas and they went nicely with the meal. The food hit the spot for my Mexican food craving but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again, which is why I gave it a solid 3-3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I loved the tacos here.  They taste very fresh and flavorful.  My favorite hands down are the adobada tacos.  They are very friendly and have a decent siting area.  It's a small place but worth the stop."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! All I wanted was some basic carne asada tacos but all our regular spots close early on Mondays. We happened upon this little shop and could not have been happier. The menu is simple- only a handful of different items with your choice of meats. I got my carne asada tacos on corn tortillas, hubby had a couple chicken tacos on flour and a carne asada cheese crisp all on flour tortillas. They had a decent selection of condiments to chose from. The meat- both the chicken and beef- were perfectly seasoned, tortillas were excellent, and we both washed it down with some Mexican cokes still in the bottle. Great dinner and about 20$ total which can't be beat. It's a tiny little place and given it's location I'm sure it's hopping at lunch time for we were the only people there at 7pm. Will return regularly!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the tastiest tacos and caramelos hands down. The place looks sketchy because of the area it's located in but trust me you just can't go wrong. Just try it once and I guarantee you'll be hooked. They only have 3 items on the menu, very limited parking, very small place and next door to a porn shop but you'll look passed all that once you taste the tacos. Guaranteed!!"}
{"text":"My sister suggested we go here for lunch. Quite impressed. Very good & simple affordable menu. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"The location was easy to find, parking was small and can't imagine when their busy. Easy menu to order from. I would definitely recommend. Good meats, great salsas, quick service! 

Recommendation: corn tortillas could be a little sturdier, perhaps hand made so they don't get soggy. Yellow corn option 

Just a few changes could make this a five star!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos! The salsa was my favorite. The carne was cooked to perfection. The service was very friendly and welcoming. The menu only consists of 3 delicious items but why making anything else when those three items are so good. The price was awesome too for such good tacos. Location kinda sucks because there is hardly any parking but well worth it. I'm for sure going to be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This little itty bitty hole in the wall taco joint is this sh*t! Couldn't get enough of their tacos. Super addictive! There's plenty of toppings to add if you need them. There's not really much else I can say that hasn't already been said. This place is a winner. Don't let the location or tininess of the restaurant fool ya. I'm so happy we came across this place!!!!! My mouth still waters thinking about it! Must make it back soon...keep up the fantastic work guys."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place many times and finally decided to drop in for some street tacos. So glad I did. These are the best tacos I've ever had. The carne asada is ridiculously delicious. I will be coming back and recommending to my friends and family for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, simple, small taco grill. Basic & very affordable menu. You can't just eat one or two! Freshly made & fresh condiments to top your tacos. The restaurant is very small & looks run down, but if you can see past that, you won't be disappointed w/the food."}
{"text":"You feel like you're in Mexico when you walk into this place.  The food is amazing!  You only have three options taco de asada, vampiros, and caramelos.  This is truly... five stars for food.  Yum. I could eat 10 of the taco de asada...actually, I could eat 10 of everything."}
{"text":"Tiny shop just north of Buckeye on the west side of 7th St. 

The menu only has about six items so I'm thinking they better be amazing. Unfortunately, the items consisted of two tacos, a tostada, a bean burrito, and a cheese crisp.  Basic as it gets Mexican food. 

I ordered some carne asada tacos and a drink. 

The good: made fresh to order. Nice flavorful juicy meat cooked right. 

The bad: tiny tacos, no toppings other than a salsa bar, 2 bucks a tiny taco, did I mention they were tiny?

Another knock is a 50¢ charge for credit cards. It's 2015: Only strippers, dealers, and waiters carry cash.  If you are charging me nearly 2 dollars a taco you best be covering your own credit card fees.

I'm all for freshly made tacos but these were dollar tacos maybe 1.25 at best. If I'm dropping ~2 bucks a taco then I expect some cotija cheese, grilled onions, two tortillas, guac...you know what I'm saying?"}
{"text":"Always looking for different places to eat. Felt like tacos and read about this place on Yelp. 
Disappointed. Very limited menu. Was kinda confused by the chalk board menu.
Ordered 2 beef tacos on corn tortilla. That's exactly what got. No cheese nothing on it. They have a salsa bar with lettuce and pico de gallo. The cheese costs extra. 
The tacos were really good. Even with just lettuce on it. 
They had no chips to enjoy the salsa with and were kinda insulted that I asked. 
We will not be back. We drove 23 minutes to get here and left hungry."}
{"text":"I was downtown at children's museum with my white, suburban, Disneyland looking family and wanted to eat real mex food. So I Yelped and went here. We looked pretty funny sitting outside in this rough neighborhood with our tourist sunburns. It was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hole-the-wall location south of downtown. Great, inexpensive Tacos! Steak were my favorite. Lots of time at other places the steak is pretty poor quality, but this is really great. They don't have any chips, but I'd rather fill up on the tacos."}
{"text":"Can't take a phone order for shit. Don't try ordering take-out or pick-up. You'll either be placed on hold for 30 mins, or you'll get a \"busy\" tone."}
{"text":"Tried each meat: pork, beef, and chicken in a flour taco. All were great, but I loved loved the chicken taco. And the salsas and salad bar were amazingly fresh! So glad we stumbled upon this place which was a hop, skip, and jump from the airport rental car complex."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the carne asada is on point.  They cook the beef over mesquite lump charcoal while many of the others cook it on a flat top.  That means flavor and the flavor of the beef is outstanding.  The menu is limited but what they do serve is all very good.  The flour tortilla is nice and dense with plenty of lard while the corn tortilla was soft and supple.  They also have a salsa / topping bar with items like shredded cabbage, limes, radishes, pickled onions, avocado salsa, a hot salsa and another salsa I didn't try.  

The atmosphere is lacking and there is bar seating inside with about 3 or 4 tables outside.  The service is great and both times I was greated warmly and they seem to appreciate that you are there.  

All in all, this is where I will now go for carne asada.  America's is eh, Tacos Atoyac is awesome but I've never been wild about their carne asada and many other places simply can't match the flavor of the meat here and really, isn't that what it's all about?"}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot hands down. The tacos are great and very very affordable. The carne asada is the best I have had at any taco shop. It's no wonder that they have won awards for their tacos because they are awesome."}
{"text":"Great Steak!!! 

I was excited to try it out and it didn't dissapoint, I got four nice sized tacos with plain flour tortilla and carne... you gotta prepare it yourself and get everything you need which I DIG! The flavor in the steak rivals someplace you pay $$ for but its a little cut place off Buckeye and its hard to see if your not paying attention lol. 

I will be back, cuz I owe the nice miss at the cashier $0.25 since i didn't have change to break even on my purchase. Mucho Amor!"}
{"text":"The pork tacos are amazing.  The best in Phoenix!!! This is how REAL Mexican Cowboys eat."}
{"text":"An authentic street taco shop hidden away near the warehouse district. You'll want to grab toppings from
the salsa bar. Pollo was charred perfectly."}
{"text":"These Carne Asada tacos are pretty good!! Really similar to the original from Sonora Mexico. We celebrated Cinco de Mayo, left feeling happy! Thanks for the best tacos north of the border!"}
{"text":"I am sitting here overwhelmed with regret. I wish I would have gotten more. The flavor was perfect, the meat was cooked perfectly and the flour tortilla were on point. I will be going back this weekend, this place is going to be my new problem. The caramelos were everything!"}
{"text":"I love this place. No frills, simple, amazing. The Carne Asada is outstanding and the simplicity of the menu makes this place good at what it does. I can say that when people come into town and they ask where to get good tacos, I take them here. The Vampiro with carne is highly recommended."}
{"text":"No matter what you get you don't be disappointed. Prices are worth it. The only negative, if any, is the wait time, however, just one cook. The food was worth the wait. So good, I had to make another stop shortly after."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Vampiros is tasty goodness. Anytime I'm downtown, this is the spot! Fast, delicious & friendly!"}
{"text":"Yes. Just yes. No regrets. So many salsas, amazing carne asada. Simple but great menu."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you want carne asada tacos that is about all they had besides quesadillas. The meat was full of flavor the taco was delicious .   I prefer my tacos with cilantro and onion which was no where to be found but it was just as delicious with cabbage and there salsas.  I would recommend this place for lunch. The place is tiny but it is super clean and they are friendly. Service was fast. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Bomb diggity, the meat is outstanding. The vampiros are hella good but the caramelos are my favorite. The flour tortillas are on point. I would give it 5 stars but the green salsa & guacamole weren't good. Horchata is bomb too!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is open Mon - Saturday until 9pm and closed on Sundays. I love the food here and was so disappointed to make the drive out from Scottsdale one night only to discover they were closed. YELP shows that they close at midnight however, they close at 9pm (insert sad face) Google has the correct hours for this business."}
{"text":"Small menu, but everything I tried was delicious and reasonably priced -- absolutely amazing street tacos! I'm not always a fan of corn tortillas so it was nice to have the option of flour as well. They also had a good variety of fresh toppings and salsas to choose from. It may not look like much on the outside but it is definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! My wife and I and our two year old have been several times. They have delicious tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and tostadas.  The inside is very small but the young lady behind the counter is always very nice and polite and the food is ready so quickly too. Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places around. Luckily I live near by to I take advantage of their carne Estrada tacos quite often :) their chicken or pork tacos are good too.. plus you have the serve yourself bar for different type of spices and veggies"}
{"text":"I didn't think the tacos were that great like everyone raves about. If you think this is the best taco place....you must not go out often. I would have given them a 3 for average but customer service was excellent and the prices are decent.  I will not come back."}
{"text":"Great stop for authentic street tacos. What you see is what you get. No frills. Small shop. Great carne. Nice people. We came on our way out of town for last minute tacos and I'm glad we did."}
{"text":"Tacos Sonora Grill is now open for business. The neighborhood is rather sketchy and parking is limited so you may want to consider visiting during daylight hours. The menu is limited and the tacos are small. However, the carne asada is flavorful and there's a self-serve toppings bar to personalize it all. This is a very small restaurant with absolutely no seating indoors. Plan on take out in case you can't find a seat at one of the four small outdoor tables. Considering those eating at the restaurant are likely to sit outdoors, I would recommend they place a trash can where people are most likely to use one. The only one I saw was indoors. The prices are right at $1.50 per taco (two dollars for bottled soda) but if you're paying with a card, be compared to fork over an extra $.50."}
{"text":"Tender, well-seasoned beef + amazing flour tortillas + tasty salsa with a kick = awesome tacos. Simple menu with simple concept but done so well. Cheese crisp was an added bonus."}
{"text":"I love these tacos they are the very best in town and at very affordable prices the staff is very friendly I'm definitely going to be a regular here since I done live to far away"}
{"text":"The Best tacos in town. The meat has great flavor. I would recommend the VAMPIROS.!!!!"}
{"text":"Really great carne asada!!! I only gave four stars due to the asada being a little greasy (but tasty, for sure) and lack of horchata. Reasonable price. No frills, add your own toppings."}
{"text":"Great street style tacos, reminds me of rocky point but better. Loving going here when I am on this side if town."}
{"text":"I love his place. It exceeds the hole in the wall expectations. Its not unnecessarily fancy for a taco spot, but the food is good af. Chicken is my fav, but I understand the nods for their carne asada. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sonora Taco Shop isn't nearly the best taco joint Phoenix has to offer, but its still a great option is you're downtown looking for a quick fix. Sollid meat quality is complimented by an impressive salsa bar. The tacos will run you $1.99 each and an additional $.50 to use your credit card."}
{"text":"Definitely one street taco shop to visit!  The menu is super short (great sign) and the flavor is there.  The tacos are on the small side, but as in typical Mexican fashion, the fixins are fresh and plenty.  Load up.

Try whatever they have as a special that day, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Phenomenal tacos.  Any kind you want as long as you want carne asada.  Minimal indoor seating, zero ambiance.  Going back soon."}
{"text":"Found this place after going to an event at the convention center.  Sketchy area, but it's safe...just next to an adult video shop. The place is small,  clean,  and simple.  Menu has 3 items,  all similar.  They have bottled Mexican sodas...including apple! The owners are super nice, speak English...not that I care but I know some of you might.  The flavor is good...my vote is for the one with the cheese.  Steak and cheese is always the way to go.  You'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Phoenix! I've been there several time on a week day during lunch rush, and I've never waited more than 3 minutes. The beef is high quality and cooked perfectly every time. We travel from the East Valley at least once a month for their tacos and Mexican CocaCola."}
{"text":"They have the best tasting carne asada.  I got the carne asada burrito and it was so flavorful and filling.  I won't have to eat for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Excellent tortillas! Would highly recommend when in the area. The pork tacos were great."}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic mexican street tacos this is your place. Their menu is very small and simple with taco choices of carne asada, chicken and pastor. They have vampiros and quesedillas as well. They have a good variety of salsas with all the taco fixings and mexican sodas to wash it down. Small cozy place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The best taco shop in Arizona. Love their tacos and always great service. It's nice that they expanded their menu a little bit.

Would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"We stopped here after flying into town. Loved the food and would recommend this little place to anyone looking for a quick, delicious meal"}
{"text":"I loved it! The tacos were very good. We went very late and didn't check the time. We came in 5 min before closing and they were very nice and I didn't even notice how late it was. Very good food and awesome service."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall type of spot that you'd totally miss should you not be looking specifically for it. It's right next to an adult shop too, so even more obscure I'd say, unless of course you were wanting to get your naughty purchases before or after! 

Sonoran tacos just recently closed to make it a tad bigger- there is a bit more seating on the inside and the menu changed although not a whole bunch but they now added beans and a burrito to their menu. Before they only offered tacos, caramelos (quesadilla with meat in it), and vampiros (hard shell flat crispy tortilla with beans cheese meat)! All of which have been delicious. The sizes are fairly small but they definitely fill you up. They have a serve yourself salsa bar there as well and usually have radishes and cucumbers - which I love to lemon up and salt to enjoy before or with my tacos. 

The pastor is delicious but nothing beats their carne asada. Perfectly seasoned and tender and tasty! My friends and I have deemed it \"porn tacos\" and usually try to come at least once a month because it's just worth it!"}
{"text":"Great little taco shop, don't let the location keep you away.  If you have your windows down you can smell the aroma of grilling meat as you drive by, follow your nose. 

Prices are reasonable, the menu is simple but has everything you need, including a nice salsa bar.  The staff are great and they are putting out a quality product using good cuts of meat. Be sure and try the pork, it is so flavorful.  The place is super small but I haven't had a problem finding a spot to sit."}
{"text":"Small taco shop with a very simple menu. Taco, tostadas, and burritos. Flower or corn tortillas and can get a side of borracho beans. Food is good and fast with a excellent salsa bar to load up your tacos that are served just meat and tortilla. Ordered 3 beef and 3 chicken and only got 3 meat 1 chicken. So ok any human can make a mistake, but that's not why the 3 stars. The borracho beans are not borracho. They are refried and slightly watered down. When I asked for a spoon the response was \"we don't have any\" . Im being sarcastic when I say \"sure I like to eat bean soup with a fork\". Sounds like they don't keep stock or supply person forgot to order. Lastly every taco I got had bone, or meat gristle and not small pieces it big ones! Big ad So that means they are not very caring of the meat. They just cook it and cut it up instead of fully preparing it. Would I come again maybe but plenty of competing shops to pick from. This place will have to step up their game."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos have THE best flavor. They were so good, we went back for more!! Anytime we're in Phoenix, I will be eating tacos here!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and LOVE the place. I've been satisfied every single time. Everything in their menu is great. Delicious mouth watering flavor. To make it even better, prices are cheap. I will definitely go back. Try it out! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is very small and looks run down but don't judge a book by its cover because the tacos are bomb!!!!! Definitely a hidden gem. The food tastes so authentic, I will be coming back often."}
{"text":"the best carne asada in Phoenix..the menu is super small but they get it RIGHT!! the lady working the cash box aint bad on the eyes at all. 2$ coke bottles salsa is on point..THE BEST CARNA ASADA IN THE WORD CRAIG.....THE WORLD!!!"}
{"text":"Food is on point and super cheap. Close to my work and they're quick about making it. The choices are limited but are one of the best dives to grab great tacos. Don't expect much of a parking lot but again, the tacos overlook everything."}
{"text":"I'm usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.  For the size and price - order multiples.  Love the salsa bar.  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat."}
{"text":"Simple Menu. 
Run Down Area. 
Best Freaking Tacos in Phoenix! 

No matter what time or day I go, the food taste the same. Fresh quality ingredients are used here, and I know the owners take pride in what he serves. 

Yes sometimes they might be busy and can't get the salsas out in time, but it's worth a try. I can tell you with certainty that these Tacos are in my Top 5 all time. 
I've lived in Mexico and it's tough to beat some tacos in Mex, but these guys are here to stay! 

Best Sonora street tacos in all PHX!"}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time and will for sure be returning. I tried the carne asada burro and it was perfect, from a delicious tortilla to well seasoned beef. Also tried a pastor taco....yummm. Can't wait to have it again."}
{"text":"When I tell my wife I am working late or at the gym, I am lying.  \"Hey honey, I have a Zumba class with some of the boys tonight\".  All lies.  

I am here stuffing my face.  This place is a gem for those that love Mexican food.  

This place is a must. 

Pros:  great, flavorful food and salsas.  Great salsa bar.  Indoor seating. 

Cons:  parking is limited.  Located in a run down area south of Downtown phoenix.  Bathroom is dark and rundown and looks as if it is a place where Freddy Krueger would come get you."}
{"text":"Fabulous taco shop. Stopped in for a bite while we were on that side of town. Neighborhood seems sketchy, but the restaurant is clean, the staff is super nice and the food is superb. We tried one each of the tacos- asada, pollo, al pastor and an asada burrito. All the food was great but oh man, I haven't had al pastor that good in a LONG time. The vampiros are super yummy too- think hard shell taco with beans and cheese plus the meat. I think next time I'll try a vampiro with al pastor."}
{"text":"Just found a great little taco joint!  Now if you don't like steak, then you won't like Taco Sonora Grill.  But if you do, you are in for a huge treat!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much on the outside but inside it's cosy and clean with great service.  Awesome awesome tacos.  Amazing enough that I went and bought more."}
{"text":"Sonora Taco Shop caught my attention after being cited as the \"Best Carne Asada\" winner from the New Times \"Best Of\" Awards in 2015. Not that I take those awards seriously, but it was a good enough excuse to give this place a try.

Okay. While neither my girlfriend or myself would declare Sonora as offering the best asada we've found in Phoenix, the tacos aren't too bad. Are they going to change your life or teach you something that you previously didn't know about tacos? No. But for the cheap prices, they do just fine for a quick fix.

I ordered a total of three in order to sample their options, which include carne asada, al pastor, and chicken for $1.89 each. The chicken and asada were both pretty standard and comparable to what you'd get at most places. Not much to shout about in terms of flavor depth, but nothing really wrong with them either. Their al pastor, in particular, as other people have noted, is actually very good and what I consider to be the best of the three options - provided you can handle a bit of spice.

The place itself is incredibly small, fully living up to the \"hole-in-the-wall\" street taco shop setup that we've all become accustomed to. 

I'd recommend them for a quick and cheap bite, but with so many other options in the surrounding area, I'd rank them as just being a-okay for what they are.

Give 'em a try."}
{"text":"Real deal street tacos 
Pastor is too die for and the toppings are unlimited 
So simple , so fresh so delish ! Big fan"}
{"text":"Great food and very cheap.   Menu consists of tacos, burritos, tostadas, and cheese quesadillas."}
{"text":"Oooh I bet this taco shop got plenty of action this Cinco de Mayo weekend-as it should! This cute, humble little restaurant serves some of the best, authentic street tacos. Be careful driving by as you might miss it! Their menu is small but mighty, and has a salsa bar with the essentials. And be sure to top off your meal with a Mexican soda."}
{"text":"Yo this place is seriously as close as I got to the food i got on the other side of the line in the sand. The menu is simple and too the point. They don't have all the fancy bs that some of these other taco shops do. The people are really cool and they get the orders out quickly even though they are serving people during the lunch hour rush. The best part is the prices are fair and serving size is very generous. Three tacos is literally enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"This taco shop is amazing! I came here right after class one day and ordered 4 tacos thinking i wouldnt be full. Just about 2 tacos did it for me. I ordered the pastor and asada. Pastor is definitely my favorite. The asada is pretty good for those not into the spicy meat. They have all the toppings on the side for you to put on yourself which i truly admire. Their salsas are great tasting and i enjoy being able to pick between corn or flour tortillas. They are a bit small and parking is extremely limited. Definitely worth a try and something to bookmark."}
{"text":"This place has some of the BEST authentic tacos I've ever tasted, That's  saying a lot coming from California. The ingredients are fresh, and the meet is very moist. The staff is extremely friendly and make you feel at home and they're very tiny taco shop.don't let the outside for you, this place is great! I will definitely be coming back here if I travel through Arizona again."}
{"text":"Legit.

The menu is very very simple, but the food is outstanding. The location - not so much... However, I would definitely come back here if I was in the downtown area. 

Molly and I sampled everything they offered on the menu (there's like 3 things, and they are basically all different versions of the same thing), and we both ordered seconds. It's a small place - there's more seating on the patio outside than inside. The owner said he wanted to do a food truck - I think the menu is probably better suited for that. 

This place kicks the collective asses of most of the fancy Arizona Mexican \"Street Tacos\" that you would find around the Valley. This is definitely more authentic... as others have stated, it's very much like something you would get in Mexico (though I've never had anything nearly this good in Mexico)."}
{"text":"I'm here almost every other day! The food actually taste like real Mexican food and they are always super nice. I always have a caramelo which is a small flour tortilla quesadilla that is packed with delicious tender carne asada! It's seriously worth the trouble of finding a parking spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos, you can taste the char since these are \"al carbon\" which means they are cooked over a fire and not a flat top. I got a carne asada on flour tortilla and a al pastor on corn. The flour tortilla tasted freshly made the corn not as much. I also got a Mexican coke. Total with 50¢ debit charge was just over $7. Not the cheapest pair of tacos I've ever had, but tasty none the less. The place is rather small could probably sit 6 people comfortable inside and another 10 or so outside. I sat alone (again) and a nice white family sat at the bench beside me, they seemed nice but their banal conversation bored me (see why I sit alone now). Nice outing, wouldn't mind eating here again."}
{"text":"Tacos Sonora Grill is located a stones throw away from Chase Field. Nope, not close enough to walk there...unless you've got the time, but it could be a great little stop on the way to the game. The menu is very limited; I hope you like beef. I do and enjoy the little tacos. They taste good and you can choose from three salsas and a few items to garnish your meal. Unfortunately, the menu leaves me craving a little more variety and I wonder \"What if?\" Until then, TSG is the little restaurant I'll appreciate for what it is which is simple tacos at a decent price that can suit your needs when you're around the corner or craving some good street tacos. Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a Rocky Point style taco in Phoenix and I have finally found it.  

Simple menu  

Tacos, Vampiros, Quesadillas..... thats it.

Tacos - exactly like the delicious street side tacos in Rocky Point.  

Vamprios - grilled corn tortilla with cheese, beans, and carne. 

Quesadilla  - little street style quesadilla  with the best cheese ever.
                       
I'm sorry but Americas Tacos just lost me as a regular.....  I have found my new taco stand!!!




Update - Still thinking about that Quesadilla!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I've never had better Mexican street tacos in my life. Not even in Mexico!  This is my second time by this week, and I think this will be my goto stop on my way to classes from now on!  

All of the meats are flavorful and delicious.  They have several salsas to choose from from mild to wild (habenero).

The best!"}
{"text":"I'd been curious about this place(which I believed had changed hands a few times in the past), so I finally stopped in the other day. Being that that don't automatically put cheese on their tacos, I thought 'this must be some well seasoned  meat'....and it was. Simply put, I'll go back. Those flour tortillas are in point."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for carne asada and you are in the downtown area, give Sonora Grill a call, make sure they are open. Delicious food! Similar to Ta'carbon on the west side. The reasons I didn't give it 5 stars is there isn't much parking, its located next door to an adult bookstore, the salsas are tasty but mild, nothing with a kick and the portions are on the small side."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing. Wonderful carne asada tacos. The carne asada was moist and fresh. The inside is very nice and the music is great. My new favorite taco place."}
{"text":"The Sonora Taco Shop just plain out and out ROCKS.  The food is great, and the people are wonderful.

The Carne Asada with Shrimp tastes great.  The flour tortillas are eqaually good.  Can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"One bite was all it took, the tacos al carbon are heaven! I got the al pastor and one asada. Definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"KISS- Keep It Simple, Stupid.

This applies to a lot of things- apparently food can definitely be one of those things. Just three things on the menu makes things uncomplicated- but you really can't go wrong. With the prices being so affordable, we tried all three, and were happy with everything. The topping bar made it easy to customize, and the service was fast and friendly. 

So I'll state the obvious, yes- it's in the hood. Well, get over it. It's worth the drive into the cuts and nobody tried to mug us (even though we parked in the porno store parking lot). 

My *only* wish would be for some chicken to go with that first rate beef for those of us who only eat beef on a rare occasion, but I can't really complain. They do what they do and they do it well. Thanks Tacos Sonora Grill!"}
{"text":"We stopped in this cute little taco shop to try their steak tacos based on Yelp reviews. The decor was rustic and tastefully done. The you lady at the counter was very friendly and helpful. We had 4 Taco De Asada with almost every sauce they have to offer. The steak was nice and hot, cooked perfectly. The corn tortillas were lightly fried in oil which, held the generous portion of meat perfectly. Don't let the location of this shop detour you, or you will miss out on a tasty quality taco."}
{"text":"Good price. Good food. Outside seating. And a view of downtown! I got the carne asada burrito, and mini quesedilla with a glass bottle of sprite for $12.00"}
{"text":"I had tried to come down here on Labor Day, but they were closed.  I drove back to SD tonight and this was right off the freeway on my way home.  I decided to stop in and get some tacos before my long drive.

I walked in and placed my order for 4 tacos.  2 of them in corn and 2 of them in flour.  They only have carne asada here so it makes your choice simple lol.  $7.50 and I went to the salsa bar.  This is where it was a bit meh.  This salsa bar was depleted!  There was no cabbage, minimal hot sauce (I had to turn the container at an angle just to scoop out a little bit) etc.  I mean, I did get enough stuff to put on the tacos, but it would have been nice to have it fully stocked.  Anyways.........a few minutes later, the lady bought out my tacos.  I took them outside and dug in.  Here is how they were..........

Carne Asada Tacos-  They were decent.  They serve them to you as plain as can be.  Tortilla and meat.  That is it.  You dress them yourself.  I put a little pico, a little hot sauce and a little avocado sauce on my tacos.  The meat was definitely tender.  It wasn't bursting with flavor but it was definitely seasoned ok.  The best part of the taco was the tortilla though.   I have had better carne asada, but these tortillas are top shelf. Both the corn and flour were awesome!  (So far in AZ, I have had the best homemade tortillas...better than SD.  The stuff that goes IN the tortillas is way better in SD, but the actual tortilla...Phoenix wins so far)  The tacos were a little small but they did fill my stomach for a few hours at least.  Service was friendly.  The lady working the counter was nice and when I went inside to throw away my trash, the cook/owner? thanked me for coming in and gave me a big smile.  I'm down with that!   Great customer service!

Will I be back?  Maybe.  If I was at a Dbacks game or something and was craving carne asada tacos, I would know where to go.  Would I drive here from my house in Surprise?  Highly unlikely.  They are exactly what 3 stars is.......... A-OK."}
{"text":"Maybe I was incredibly hungry, or maybe it was just THAT good. Either way, one of my favorite taco shops that I'll be bringing my friends to. 

Service: its self-service. The cashier was patient with my indecisive self and took the time to explain what all the different meats were and which ones were her favorite. 

Food: oh my goodness. I stuck with street tacos and piled my pork tacos with all the pickled condiments and spices. The meat was flavorful and melted in my mouth. I also picked up a burrito for my boyfriend who couldn't make it. It was a spicy pork burrito that was hands down better than Chipotle. It wasn't as full as a Chipotle burrito, but what that really meant was that you could taste the flavors of the food that much more. 

They don't serve alcohol here, but there are Mexican sodas! 

Ambiance: small, not great for groups. There's some outdoor seating, but we went during a dust storm. Having grit in my mouth and food wasn't too appealing. Also, the washroom was gross. That's why I knocked it down a star. When you're dealing with food you eat with your hands, it's pretty important to have a sanitary place to be able to wash your hands. There was a sink, but no paper towels. Which meant having to touch the grimy door handle way too much. 

I'll be back. With hand wipes. Or maybe I'll just get a burrito."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and enjoyed the tacos and quesadilla. We had the carne asada, chicken taco, pastor by far the best of the tacos and a cheese quesadilla. Pastor had the best flavor, others were a little less flavorful, but the sauces added a nice taste. The cheese quesadilla was yummy. Lovely folks in this restaurant."}
{"text":"There wasn't anything special about this place. I've had better and cheaper tacos elsewhere. Based on the reviews I was really excited, but I guess my expectations were to high."}
{"text":"Family owned and super friendly service. The cashier is always smiling and is open to small chit chat as long as she's not busy. Her husband mans the charcoal grill in the kitchen. They keep the menu short and to the point: Tacos, caramelos (quesadilla with carne Asada on flour tortilla), and vampiros (tostada layered with refried beans and carne Asada). The meat can use a little more flavor but it's cooked well and tender. I think they also have flan and a few other items but I've never ordered anything else other than the authentic Mexican bottled sodas. The salsa bar includes various items aside from just salsa. All in all, this is a great spot for a quick bite to eat. Parking can be a bit of a hassle but they have an agreement with the adult store next door to use their lot for customer parking. 

Please tip them well. They're really close to my job and I'd love to see them stay in business."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, we stopped in for carne asada tacos and they were delicious. Definitely a little taste of Mexico"}
{"text":"This is why l love Yelp.
Visiting Phoenix l was looking for some authentic Mexican take-out, and boy did l hit the jackpot.
The shoe-box restaurant in the middle of downtown doesn't look like much but packs a whollop when it come to taste. A friendly staff explained what each mexican dish was and packed it up quick at a bargain of a price. When l got back to the hotel, l unwrapped and bit into a beef burrito. Lots of me with the perfect spices, and big...the thing was huge. Thanks for your suggestions,and of I'm ever back in town you'll definitely see me. 
You have a friend for lide."}
{"text":"I live in south Phoenix. I'm always passing the Sonora taco shop on my way to work and have always been curious as I'm always looking for new tasty taco shop experiences:) Finally went today...SUPER IMPRESSED! I had two carne asada tacos and one carne asada vampiros (tostada with cheese, beans and meat). They have a nice selection of extremely tasty salsas and accoutrements. Everything was fresh and delicious!!! Prices were very reasonable and the staff was very kind."}
{"text":"Sonora Taco Shop is fantastic! The tacos are simple and delicious! They have some of the best tacos in the valley. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a good taco shop, it's a little small inside but it's still has good tacos.

There isn't much parking so I imagine most people have to walk pretty far to get some street tacos."}
{"text":"Easily the best carne asada in Phoenix. Small place right by Chase Field with really basic menu. They give you everything plain and you top with salsas, onion, whatever you want. A must try!"}
