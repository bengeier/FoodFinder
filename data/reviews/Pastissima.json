{"text":"We stopped here to re-fuel during our never ending hunt for an apt in the area. It was excellent! I had the chicken apple curry salad - which was as fresh as it gets, and my fianc√© had some sort of pasta tortilini thing (he ate it so quickly i hardly even saw what it looked like). 

The services was great and the price very reasonable. It's geared more towards takeout, but there is a little counter to eat at and some seats outside. 

Now that we live in the neighbourhood (the meal gave us the energy needed to continue one with our apt hunt) we'll definitely become repeat customers."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Patissima caters lunches for me about 2-3 times per week. They are easy to work with, reliable and the food is delicious! As if that isn't great enough; they're also a lovely, friendly crew! I appreciate working with them and highly recommend this restaurant. Thanks Team Pastissima!"}
{"text":"I was in the area on Saturday and decided to go back to Patissima to give them another chance and see if the staff had really addressed this issue of touching food without washing their hands after handling cash.

I was however very disappointed to see that the person who helped me did not wash his hands after handling the cash at the checkout and picked up the sandwich I ordered with his bare hands! 

I immediately addressed the issue and he apologized and went to wash his hands, albeit he returned the sandwich back to its original place!

I do not understand why the servers do not use any gloves or just have one person handling the cash. Why is this so complicated?
  
It is unfortunate as the food is good and it's just shocking that the staff just cannot seem to deal with this very basic food handling 101 requirement -WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE HANDLING FOOD IF YOU DO NOT WEAR GLOVES!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The food tastes great and they are more than willing to cater to individual taste. Fast, fresh, friendly and all around great. Love this place and so do my kiddos. They love the meatballs and they really love pasta shells with butter sauce and Parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"Love this place. I eat here about 3 times a week as it is just down the street from where I work. Their grilled tuna wraps are the BEST I've ever had - always tasty and fresh. Other recommendations are the made-to-order pasta bar, fresh daily soups, and build-your-own salad bar.  The owner and staff are extremely friendly and the selection of ready to eat and take home food items is impressive. 5 star staff + tasty home made food = highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've not had pasta this homey and delicious since my trip to Italy. Tucked in some random strip of plazas along the busy stretch of Yonge St just north of Eglinton is this unassuming place with uninspiring decor and almost non-existent dine-in seating that is an absolute gem! There's a reason why this whole-in-the-wall place has been in existence for about 2 decades at this location.

Pastissima offers an incredible variety of frozen homemade pasta and pasta sauces. They have such a wide selection, I am certain that there is something for everyone.

They also serve food as well; from sandwiches to salads and of course pasta. I cannot comment on anything else other than their pasta but from the looks of it, the rest of the stuff isn't all that appealing. And why would you want to eat a salad at a place that makes fantastic pasta?? They usually don't have a whole lot of variety to choose from if you are dining in but whatever it is they have it tastes incredible. You can really taste the freshness in the dish from the pasta to the sauce. The quality of the ingredients also really comes through.

So do yourself a favour and stop by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh pasta and super affordable. When I worked around the corner I ate here nearly every day. They mostly seem to do catering but do open during the day to serve some of the freshest handmade pastas in the city. 
The sell both cooked to order for immediate consumption and handmade pasta and sauces to take home. 
If you are in the area, even just for lunch I highly recommend this as a place go.

And cool side note Keanu Reeves worked there."}
{"text":"I've been making the trek to Pastissima for years for the cajun alfredo pasta and salad combo lunch box.  In the past year ownership seems to have changed and prices have gone up with the take out section taking a bit of a hit.  Prices are getting a bit ridiculous and the cesear salads don't have the delicious baguete croutons anymore so I'm less inclined to go out of my way for a trip.

If you're a pasta nut looking for quick take out it's still a great optoin."}
