{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there last night with his father. My boyfriend and I are both vegetarian, and surprisingly, there were veggie options AND they were great!   I had the mac and cheese. When I asked to have it without chicken, the server also asked if I wanted it made without chicken broth. My boyfriend had a fancy tofu dish that was delicious (although he wasn't full), and his dad had the jerk pizza, which he really enjoyed.   The prices are reasonable considering the quality of food that you get and the ambiance.   The desserts were great too. They have \"bite sized\" versions if you just want a little bit."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday. The price is cheaper than before, but the food and service was definitely not the same as before......"}
{"text":"My partner and I had brunch here this past weekend. I have had positive experiences with the Oliver and Bonacini brand, but this visit left me underwhelmed.     The dining room was massive, formal, and more than half empty at 1.30 PM on a Saturday. We were seated in the \"lounge,\" which promised to be a warmer, more intimate room. The industrial-style concrete and the bare Edison bulbs clashed with the kitchy library-book wall-paper, and a number of tables were randomly scattered around and unusable. We sat next to a dance floor (or was it a wine and cheese mingling area?) left over from the room's previous incarnation.   The service was first-class. Well done, team (I phoned in a reservation, and was eagerly attended to throughout the visit).   The menu looked intriguing and the prices not unreasonable. Unfortunately the food was a disappointment. In my O&B breakfast, my eggs were cooked over hard (not over easy as I had asked), and were served over a thick film of white oil. Potatoes were sub-par and salty. I had been enticed by the promise of a cheddar scone, but that too was a letdown when it turned up dry and bland on my oil-drenched plate. The server was kind and agreed to replace the meat in my dish with market vegetables (anything but meat would do, I had begged). The menu warns that no substitutions are possible, but that would have made waffles the sole option for veg-friendly patrons. Alas, the vegetables were drenched in butter and salt. My partner's eggs Benedict was not much to brag about either. The eggs were expertly poached, but they were served straight on a bare, dry scone. The kitchen did not offer to replace his ham (which he also asked to skip) with even a lonely leaf of spinach.  I'd return if the food improves. We need more solid brunch spots in downtown."}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner of Bayview Village, an upscale suburban mall, Oliver & Bonacini Cafe & Grill is a step above the typical mall restaurant.   Part of the Oliver & Bonacini group, this location features a large seasonal menu with items running the gamut from Mushroom Soup (no butter, no cream) to pastas and seafood.  The Mushroom Soup is a pureed blend of mushrooms and mushroom stock filled with the familiar woods-ey taste of mushrooms without the heaviness of cream. The pizza selection is highlighted by the Al la Marco Pizza featuring barbequed duck shredded with cilantro and hot sauce. A delightful variation to the typical pizzas offered at restaurants.  Deliciously rich pastas include a macaroni and cheese and a mushroom lasagna.   Desserts highlights include Soma ice creams and the famous carrot cake. Other desserts are standard fare.  Service is always friendly and spot-on, a testament to the OB training they receive. At a slightly higher price-point than the typical casual dinner out, you'll be rewarded by the attention to food and service."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for dinner, very good food. Tried it today for brunch and it was so so. I ordered the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, loved it, very delicate. My husband had the steak and eggs, it was nothing to rave about.   Only thing is service is kinda slow. It might be ok for dinner because you want to spend time at a restaurant and enjoy but when you're there for brunch on a weekend and you have places to get to..it kinda sucks!"}
{"text":"so, i ended coming here with 10 of my friends for my bday...and let me tell you, i was and still am really disappointed!  service: HORRIBLE! usually, the service here is okay, but this took the cake. the waitresses kept rushing us to order, kept giving attitude to my friends, never smiled, took a long time to refill our glasses (and the restaurant wasn't packed at all!), and was HORRIBLE explaining the menu.  my friend said, \"she's probably acting like that because we're not dressed up fancy like everyone else...i want to put her in her place!who the heck does she think she is!\"  food:  unlimited bread  5/5 - hot, fresh, delish!  onion rings 2/5 - crispy yes, but the batter kept falling apart from the actual onions....  mussels (which comes w/a side of french fries) 1/5 - last time we ordered it, it had plenty of sauce/broth and tasted yummy...this time...had a VERY weird taste to it and came with barely any broth  grilled atlantic salmon w/ratatouille 1/5 - horrible and disappointing! i usually like how they grill the salmon, but this time, it was dry and VERY bland. the ratatouille wasn't the best.  creme brule 3/5 - the creme brule tasted wonderful...however, it did not come with the shortbread, which i was looking forward to.   overall: horrible! horrible! horrible! this was such a huge disappointment on my bday."}
{"text":"Order a breakfast and they burned everything to some substance that can give you cancer. It is not good for your health to eat here"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a business trip and decided to visit this place based on a friend's recommendation. The place has a nice modern decore. The menu had nothing special. The selection were limited (e.g., you could only get one type of steak !).  I ordered one of their pastas and while the taste was good, the portion was ridiculously small. I mean for pasta you expect at least a reasonable portion as it doesn't come with any side. My colleges ordered liver and chicken burger. Both of them liked the taste but again, portion was a problem.  Overall, I think this place doesn't worth the price you pay for the food."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for Mother's Day brunch. It was before the rush and not busy when we arrived. One of the people Iin our party uses a walker and they tried to seat us at a booth where she could not sit. They made us wait 15 minutes for another table that could accommodate her, despite more than half of the restaurant being empty. The general manager also refused to accommodate a simple modification to the grilled cheese to make it child friendly (just omitting the ingredients other than the bread and cheese) because apparently everything is preprepared. When the food arrived the toast was burned. Very unimpressed, particularly by the lack of accommodation by the general manager."}
{"text":"I am generally a big fan of O&B and have been there for a number of brunches, lunches and dinners - graduations, bridal showers, retirement parties etc. - although I have only ever frequented the Yonge and Front location.  My husband and I joined a friend's birthday dinner at O&B Bayview Village a few weeks ago. He ordered the lamb gnocchi, which must have been contaminated or undercooked as he threw it a up a few hours later when we got home. I emailed the manager and urged him to check on what went wrong to ensure that it doesn't happen again - that was a month ago now... after two follow-ups, still no response.   I'm vegetarian, so luckily I didn't suffer the same fate. I did point out an error on the menu though - our server confirmed that the romaine and kale caesar salad (marked as a \"vegetarian\" item) contained anchovy paste in the dressing. I know that anchovy paste is common in caesar salad dressing, and that's fine, but then the salad shouldn't be marked as a vegetarian item as that is very misleading.   Top that off with no real customer service (certainly not at the staff level, and apparently not at the management level either) - not impressed."}
{"text":"A friend of mine convinced me to try O&B for winterlicious. We had our reservation for Friday just before 8pm.  The service was TERRIBLE. The waitress would disappear for extremely long periods of time, never offered to bring drinks once we had placed our order, didnt even ask if we wanted something after our three course dinner, she simply brought us the bill. When we asked her to separate the bill she grunted and disappeared again.. maybe if she had bothered to talk to us at all before bringing it she would have known before hand we were paying separate.   It always bothers me when a waiter/waitress provides unfriendly and terrible service, only to act extremely nice when they bring the machine...thinking that those two minutes of friendliness will magically translate into a higher tip. After over an hour of being ignored? I think not..   I had the chopped rocket and romaine salad to start, it was very good but poorly served. The beef short ribs with kimchi fried rice definitely sound better than what they taste. The beef was very tender but the rice overcooked, the kimchi was not spicy at all.  For dessert I tried the Mayan Spiced Chocolate Panna Cota. I think this is the first time I don't eat  a dessert I order, and it was not because I was full... From what my friends told me though, the soup was very good.   Overall even with the winterlicious offer we were not happy with how much we paid for what we actually got, both in terms of food and service."}
{"text":"For those living in the area, the O&B Cafe represents a safe choice for a family dinner or gathering with friends. The experience definitely benefits by the airiness of a very nice room. Neither the food nor the service are spectacular and there are definitely some hits and misses, but overall I'm happy to have them as a dining choice."}
{"text":"Excellent food and decor, good service, a bit pricey.  You wouldn't expect a restaurant this nice in a mall, but O&B delivers.  The food was chef-quality (unique and well-executed).  The decor is on par with some of the nicest restaurants in big cities.  Finally, our server was friendly and competent.  All-around very pleased."}
{"text":"* Not impressed with 'O&B' name - Imperial Buffet and Famoso was better!  * Been here awhile back and returning to see if any changes (visited on a regular night and not summer/winterlicious)  * Waiter never came until 10mins after we seated and disappears for long periods at a time.  Not impressed.  * Venison Shepard's pie was pretty good, but for $19 it is a bit $$.  so-so impressed  * skip the Smokey pizza as it was 'meh'.  Toppings and white sauce was just slapped on like a corner takeout.  Large crust area was left.  I can overlook it at pizza pizza, but this is not that place.  FAMOSO @ Yorkdale was better despite the 'wood stove' claim. Not impressed  * Skip the Sunday roast special (which seemed like no-brainer).  York pudding was hard as rock and the whole bottom was actually still soaking in oil!  In oil!  I could not believe it!  Any other 'lower' place I can overlook, but O&B brand name?  I would be embarassed if I owned this. Roast was okay.  Lacking flavour and you could tell it was medium rare off the roast and pan cooked to medium and up temp.  I have had better at Imperial Buffet (seriously).  Pan gravy 'sauce'  was more like 'pan drips'.  I have gotten more liquid from a dairy creamer than what I received.  Cauliflower looked 'dead' and was overly salty.  One token 'bok choy' mixed in with 4 or 5 string beans. Definitely not impressed.  * $6 pom spritzer and blueberry spritzer was half-decent, but I really came for the food.  So-so impressed.  * Complain to the waiter or kitchen?  Wasn't in the mood so let the whole thing slide.    * Got the dessert menu and whole dinner was a exponentially negative experience.  We let the dessert slide and paid our $95 dinner and ended up down the road having dessert instead.  Not-impressed  * Would have had a better, cheaper and a full meal @ Imperial Buffet!  * Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, maybe it was a 'bad' night, maybe we expected too much, maybe I could have better at a local non-brand name joint, maybe there were too many maybe's to really bother with, maybe we will never come back, maybe you are right."}
{"text":"It's 7pm and it's like midnight in a nightclub (not in a good way). A dj and huge speakers for the afterwork crowd? Really? And after ordering a bottle of Perrier Jouet (my friend and I were celebrating) and we had to pour it ourselves. WTF? Oh wait, I'm quite sure it's at 1/4 capacity, ie. it's not busy. Lame"}
{"text":"As an O&B location, I was looking forward to a nice meal on a week night here. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with my meal... it lacked freshness, flavor and creativity. Maybe it was the summerlicious menu, but others in my party order the regular menu and were not all too happy.   The moist ciabata type dinner rolls was the most redeeming quality about this place. The ahi tuna appetizer seemed pretty good on paper, but it lacked much flavour. The salad seemed on the semi-wilted side. The haddock main was overcooked and rubbery. The spicy seafood linguini lacked any spices. I got the caramel creme for dessert, which was pretty standard.   Overall, a lacklustre meal; will definitely have to seriously reconsider coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"If there's one restaurant you should definitely go out of your way to avoid - it's O & B. The only thing this chain does well consistently is deliver subpar food. Upon taking a hiatus from O & B's, I decided to give it one more go. As always, I was completely underwhelmed by their food quality, and am left wondering in amazement how this establishment isn't going out of business. Their bread basket most certainly isn't made in-house and tastes like it's been warmed up from the local grocer's. Don't go here expecting anything special other than the blandest and most basic of foods. You'd be better off making you own food at home, the quality would easily be better."}
{"text":"We've been to Bannock and Canteen, both of which had decent food so we gave this place a try.  Food is very overpriced for what you get.  The quality of the food is mediocre, and some tables are so close together that you can hear every word the people are saying from the table next to you.  We asked to move to another table because a woman sitting next to us was talking obnoxiously nonstop (think Kitty Forman from That 70's Show) about things she didn't like.  Coke is $3.5.  My partner got one refill, and we were charged for two cokes on the bill.  Plus it tasted so weird (like they injected extra sweetener to it) he didn't even drink the refill."}
{"text":"Good meal, very tiny portion size.  I'm not a big guy, and appreciate rationally sized portions. However, I found the cup of turnip root soup and handful of kale greens that constituted a $10+ \"soup and salad\" combination to be quite lacking.  Yes, it was delicious and well prepared.  But, yes, I also left feeling hungry.  Salads and soup are intended to be light, but you shouldn't leave a restaurant feeling like you hadn't yet arrived."}
{"text":"I was at Oliver and Bonacini few weeks ago with girlfriend, her mother, and my mother for a Sunday brunch. I enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant; however I have never been blown away with the food. I myself have a lot of allergies, and made them very clear to the server. I am a Chef myself and can generally make the decision of what to eat with cross contamination in mind, however when I make my allergies clear to a server, then to get my eggs and mushrooms cooked in butter, to which I made very clear I cannot have, is just disappointing. Even more so disappointing, in my opinion is when a manager comes to apologize for the server's mistake... and that's all they offer. Now I will be eating my remade meal once everyone has finished eating, I am personally fine with that, however the in the service industry if you are to make a mistake of that magnitude, I believe it is upon the establishment to do something more than just an apology. If I had not of been weary of the food I was about to eat, I would have spent the whole day basically bed ridden in pain.     However this is not an entirely bad review, as the food they brought back was good, plain but that's how I unfortunately have to eat when I go out. Allergies can sometimes be a hard thing to cater to, just have to be on the ball about when telling your server to make sure they reiterate your allergies back to you, or clarify with them before they leave the table. If they make the error there is nothing the kitchen can do when they do not know the correct information; and you will be potentially putting yourself at risk.   Everyone else's meal was toughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to dining at Oliver & Bonacini as I had never been there before ... although I had heard it was good... but not consistently so.  Firstly, the menu was limited. It's featured as an 'Italian\" restaurant and I was dissapointed by the few Italian choices.   I love sweet potato fries and they were good! But from there it was down hill.   My steak was not cooked medium-well.. When I cut it --  there was blood on the plate! The server  didn't come to check on us until almost the end of the meal although we had tried to catch his eye. I was starving and ate it anyway... although it gave me an upset stomach.  The desserts were outrageously expensive - $8.50 for a apple/blueberry crisp which I ordered to calm my stomach!  The noise level is not conducive to having a real conversation with a business associate.  Suggest you pass on this location."}
{"text":"Having had brunch and dinner at multiple O&B locations.  I believe their strong suit is their brunch.  My wife and I ordered Huevo Rancheros and they had a special with Pork Belly.     The Huevo Rancheros was delicious, my only complaint is that it could have had little more spice; the tomatoes in the pico de gallo could have be chopped finer.  The Pork Belly special was amazing.  The pork skin was nice, crispy,  charred slightly and perfectly seasoned.  They should add this as a regular brunch item - I'd get it every time.  Surprisingly, most brunch places downtown usually have long line ups.  But O&B has a big space so I know if I am hard on time, I will be heading here for brunch for good and fast service."}
{"text":"In Toronto for work and visited this place twice in a week. Food is decent (stay away from anything too complicated) but the issue here is the service !! First time \"Angelo\" who was ok but not service focused. Felt like we were doing him the favour. Second time waitress was Leanne \"a nutritionist\" as she quite rudely informed us when my colleague asked a question about what she ordered. This woman really should not be serving, pretty sure she hates her job!!  Ok for a drop in but dime a dozen, spend your money elsewhere ..."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Actually well worth the slightly pricier menu (you get what you pay for here). Everyone in my party of 4 was really happy with their food. And the fries taste like they were done in trans fat ... I didn't even add salt and vinegar.  Bit noisy - was hard to talk."}
{"text":"Used to be regulars at this restaurant a few years back.  The restaurant is getting worse and worse.  Food is never consistent anymore.  Service is not great.  For the price you pay, not worth it."}
{"text":"My friend was hosting her birthday party at the restaurant and I admit it, it was a pretty big group (around 20 of us). I understand that we're not your business or your baller status clientele but the way they treated us absolutely terrible; it was one of the worst dining experience I have ever had.  First off, the food. I ordered the Chitarra which was okay but definitely not the best especially for the price. While my sister ordered the steak which was very dry. This would've have been a two/three stars rating. HOWEVER, the service was a huge disappointment especially coming in with such a high expectation.  For a higher priced restaurant, I was expecting a service that lived up to what I have heard about O&B. Firstly, the first server did not let us order when we wanted to as it was easier for the server to wait until EVERYONE came to the party (when we notify them a couple of members will be late and we will order first), all of us were starving at that point. Strike One.  Strike two was when my friend's sibling arrived a little later than expected, so the sibling sits beside my friend while everyone else kindly shifted a seat down. But then is proceeded to be told that if she does, it will mess up the system and our orders will be pushed back half an hour. At this point we only ordered beverages and we did not understand why.   When we were wrapping our dinner and paying the bills, the second server proceeds to make a comment of \"you guys moved around hence the paying process will take around 25 mins\" in a very rude tone. This was an unnecessary comment to make and was the final strike.    Overall, it was a disappointing dining experience especially simple things that could have been done to alleviate the situation. I would not recommend this place and definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was here for our 1 year anniversary on Sunday. Matthew, our server was excellent. I had their roast dinner which tasted great and my wife had the spinach and cheese ravioli. They had a Sauvignon Blanc special on Sundays per glass at basically half price!"}
{"text":"What happened?  Bring back the seafood salad and the coffee which taste awesome without masking it with a ton of cream and sweetener!   Open the windows and bring back the old setting, menu, and quality of food please!    Food quality has gone down.  Just doesn't match up to what this place used to be. I really miss the awesome setting and the crowd it used to attract.  The wonderful brunch in a well light restaurant with awesome service and quality of food. We used to frequent this place, almost most weekends for brunch when chance is given.    Service is still very good. Servers are always polite."}
{"text":"This location is one of an impressive portfolio of incredible restaurants including bannock and Canoe. Long story short, O&B puts the food before the artistry and both are offered at a superb level, elevated even more by superlative yet non-pretentious service. Comfort food can indeed be exciting!"}
{"text":"Joined friends for dinner before the hockey game last night. Sad to say that I arrived late for the reservation. When I was seated, my friends had already order and were about to be served.   I placedmy order, spice Italian sausage penne and it arrived ate same time as everyone else!s choice....about five minutes after I ordered.  The decor was quite pleasing. Nice wine selection. Good beers on tap.  I'd like to return for a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"I recently had family in from out of town and needed a spot for 12 people for dinner. I don't know about anyone else in Toronto but I find it very difficult to fit 12 people in for dinner anywhere in the downtown core. Either places are booked or they don't take large reservations, sometimes they wont do separate bills etc etc. Oliver & Bonacini Café Grill managed to squeeze us in for the exact time that we wanted.   We showed up about 10 mins early for the reservation and the front staff was so nice. They told us they were just waiting for someone to leave a table and ours would be set up. We had a seat and didn't mind at all since we were actually early.   After about 5 mins the manager Tyson Brocklesby came over, apologized for the delay and offered us all drinks. We all ordered beer, wine, bourbon sours etc. He announced when he delivered them that they were on the house for the wait. I think that this was amazing. These were not glasses of water. These were alcoholic drinks. not 2 of them.... 12 of them.   Our table was about 10 mins delayed which was still fine with us as we now had a drink and were just chatting and catching up with family.   On our way to the table Tyson let me know that since our table was late he knew we were probably starving so he took the liberty of ordering some appetizers for the table and they were also on the house. My family was starving so this was also bonus points for O&B.  Once at our tables the wait staff was super quick and friendly and when our food came out they had enough staff to bring everyone's dinner all at the same time and they were all piping hot! SUPER bonus points!   Tyson came by several times to check on our table and ask if we needed anything along with our waitress as well.   So just to re-cap 1) large reservations (and with separate bills) - CHECK 2) super friendly staff - CHECK 3) The best manager ever - CHECK 4) Cocktails while we waited - CHECK 5) Appetizers at the table when we sat down - CHECK 6) Quick service - CHECK 7) Food all arrived at the same time and hot - CHECK 8) Food was really yummy - CHECK 8) Good times had by all - CHECK  I will defiantly be back here!"}
{"text":"I live close to bayview village and come to this restaurant quite often! Good food and service every single time except for today!! Still good food and our waiter was very nice. My complain is about the manager Megan! I was here with my friend sitting at a table for two. We were done with our food that my brother joined us for a coffee only! He turned a chair towards our table and sat for a while, we were sitting at a corner not in the way of anyone. He just wanted to stay for 15 minutes only, like 10 minutes later a lady so called \"the manager\" came and guided a girl to sit on the table next to us (the same table my brother took a chair from). She was so rude and asked my brother to get off the chair because she needed it for the table! She didn't even bother ask nicely to have us sit on another table or offer us another extra chair!! Well to mention that there were lots of other tables available in the restaurant and she just \"chose\" the table next to us, no intentions involved!!! I asked this manager if he could sit on the other vacant table for two next to us for another few minutes and she said NO! Made him stand next to the table to pay for the bill and leave! I understand she didn't like us having one extra seat around our table but I don't understand her rude behaviour!!! It was so mean and obvious that our waiter felt bad and it was him apologizing for his manager's behaviour!!! This will be my last time here until I know she is not there anymore! We just wanted to leave and she happily handed the bill without any apology or a nice word after ruining our short get together!!!! I wish I knew her last name and will definitely follow up with her boss!"}
{"text":"I've been to O&B a few times and last night was the last. I ordered Arancini and beef ragu since it was on the cheaper end (~19).. Not only was the portion size very small, it didnt come with any bread or side dish to eat with but it was also terrible! The risotto balls very over fried and it made me soo sick this morning  to summarize: it was a funeral in my mouth!   Upon calling the restaurant to leave my comments the manager argued with me saying their food has never made anyone sick.   NOT WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Though their food doesn't really stand out, you won't be disappointed with anything on their menu. What does stand out, is their impressive service. They will make it right if something goes wrong. And when nothing goes wrong, they have always been friendly and helpful.  Grilled calamari appetizer is a must; deliciously buttery and tenderized so that my dentures don't fall out."}
{"text":"The ambience of the restaurant is great. However, the food and service do no justice to it.  The greeter at the front was pleasant and walked us to our table. Our server however, was rude, abrupt and did not smile once throughout the the whole time we were there.   The food was not good either. We ordered Huevos Rancheros and a margherita pizza. Huevos Rancheros had no salt and was cold. The pizza was not good either. It is really hard to mess up a cheese pizza, but they managed to do it somehow.  The cocktails we ordered were really good.   My bill did not include the drink. I prompted the server, politely, that she didn't include the drink on the bill. She, very rudely responded, \"I couldn't find the button so I didn't add it.\"  The whole experience was very awkward and unpleasant. We paid the tip reluctantly.   Definitely won't visit again and recommend everyone against it."}
{"text":"The pasta was really good. However the service was terribly slow for no apparent reason: the place was half-empty on Saturday night (9:30) but it took the waiter more than an hour just to ask us about the food order. And more than half an hour to bring the bill at the end. At least he was friendly.  :-)"}
{"text":"Never celebrate birthdays here!  I went there a few months ago to celebrate one of my friends' birthday. I brought in a cake for her and asked the host to bring it out after dinner as a surprise. What surprised me was when the host told me there is a $2.50 \"plating fee\" for EACH person. There was 5 of us!  This means that we paid extra $12.50 for them to cut up the cake and serve it on a plate, which we could've done ourselves. Not to mention the tax on top of it. I already bought a nice cake, balloons for my friend, and now there is this \"plating fee\" on top of it.  I understand that we are not buying desserts from O&B, thus  the \"plating fee\" however O&B should not charge customers for something so trivial as we are already giving O&B business. Most restaurants offer FREE desserts on birthdays. As customer appreciation, O&B should feel priviledged that we chose their restaurant for a birthday dinner. I doubt any of us would celebrate their bdays there again."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with a party of 5. Pretty nice and classy place. I ordered the seafood spaghettini which was okay , nothing special but definitely not worth the price. Also got a sangria which was absolutely terrible, it just tastes like club soda mixed with wine, which was not as described. Service was not the best, they were not that busy and it still took forever for someone to take our order. My friend had ordered the soup and it came out half cold. Also got the peach cobbler for dessert which was probably the highlight of the meal. Other than that would not go back."}
{"text":"Had a Mac and cheese here, very juicy and filling, didn't try much food on the menu but so far so good, looking to coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a party of 9. Our server was friendly and engaging. I ordered the pot stickers and butter chicken. Both were delicious and very filling.   My only complaint is that it took quite some time to get our drinks (over 20 minutes)."}
{"text":"My first time here!  Arrived a little early to meet friends for dinner and decided to sit and have a drink at the bar. It was incredibly busy! From the get go the service was impeccable! Hostess told me i was early and guided me to the bar, took my name down and told me she would alert the rest of my party of my whereabouts. Now this may seem standard but you would be surprised at how many Venues expect you to just text your friends and coordinate things yourself.   Within seconds of sitting at the bar i was approached by the bartender. A gentleman with a pony tale and a real charming smile. Asked  me if i would like to see a food menu or a drink menu and gave me both as i was planning on having dinner and wanted to get a head start! Wasnt quite sure what i wanted to drink so asked him to make me something, he asked me a couple of questions to get an understanding of my taste buds and wow! Was he ever spot on! He made me a bourbon drink that apparently he cooks in butter and secret crazy syrup.  I almost wanted to just stay at the bar! They vibe and environment were amazing, I wish i could remember the bartenders name but it was almost as if every one was friends with everyone! It was so much fun! As busy as it was he made sure that attention was given to everyone equally (and it was BUSY)! So much fun to watch!  My party arrived, it was a good friends birthday and a friend i have not seen in over 5 years, they were early as well but  the hostess told us that if we would like we could sit at the table if we liked, i figured why not! As i was leaving i say bye to my bartender (god i wish i remembered his name, long black hair, spanish looking?) He looks at me and says \"Make sure to try the oven roasted chicken\".  Now i have that on my mind. We get seated at a great booth and within minutes of us sitting our server approaches us, a sweet short blonde lady (i need to get better with names) Tells us the special and offers us some water to start!  We order a bottle of wine which was priced moderately compared to other places in the area (Keg, Ki, Biffs). We skipped the appies and went straight for the good stuff, My partner order the Tuna, one friend ordered the Sausage pasta the other got a burger and i got the chicken that was suggested to me! Within 10 minutes we had all the food on the table!!  Everything was immaculate, good portions, good prices and timely service! We did not even fill our wine glasses once :)  Everyone was so happy with their selection! Including myself! After dinner the server surprised us with a birthday cake with a candle and happy birthday written on it!  We skipped the coffees, we could hardly finish the cakes! Everyone looked so happy! Got the bill (Server helped me sneak pay) and was out in time to catch our show!  Wonderful Server, wonderful Bartender, Great Drinks, Great Food and amazing ambiance. Whats there not to like about this place?"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch on a Friday with a group of about 20 people. The  service was friendly and our food came really quickly. I was afraid it would take a while since we had such a large group, but they must be used to accomodating groups of this size since they are located in the financial district.    The server mentioned that the fresh juice of the day was strawberry lemonade. I'm a sucker for fresh juice so I had to order this. It was so good, I finished two servings of it!  To start off my meal, I had the crispy oyster, portobello and cremini mushroom salad (served on a bed of arugula with garlic mayo) for $10.95. The serving was actually a lot bigger than I had expected. The oysters and mushrooms were deep fried, tempura style and were very plentiful. I was pretty full after eating this alone. This was a decent dish, although nothing really special.  For my main, I decided to go with the pancetta and mushroom pizza (roasted garlic, arugula & Parmigiano-Reggiano cream) for $14.25. The menu said \"mini pizza with choice of salad or Yukon Gold fries\", so I was expecting a small pizza. But it was a normal-sized flatbread pizza. The taste was great! You really can't go too wrong with those flavour combinations. I particularly enjoyed the parmigian-reggiano cream. I also substituted the regular fries for sweet potato (I almost always do!). I also enjoyed these.  After all that food, I'm sure you would've thought I'd be done by now, but I wanted to end my meal with something sweet. So, I shared the milk fudge cake ice cream (two scoops) with a friend. The menu noted that the ice cream is made by Soma, \"a chocolatemaker in Toronto's Historic Distillery District\" At $7.25 for 2 scoops it was pretty pricey, but SO good! Loved this!   Overall, I really enjoyed my meal. I've eaten here at this location back in December and also really enjoyed it. Previously I had tried the carrot cake for dessert and loved it, so I recommended it to a friend who said it was one of the best carrot cake's he's had. My favourite part about this dessert is the lemon sour cream ice cream. It just goes so well with the carrot cake."}
{"text":"I came here during the week to celebrate a friends birthday. I ordered a wood oven pizza which was good if not memorable, but the reason for the low rating was the service. It wasn't particularly bad per say but just..disinterested. No smile, no \"good evening I'll be your waiter today\" friendly chatter, and the kicker was that after we received our bill, he took it back and after 15 minutes gave a new bill with an automatic 18% gratuity, im guessing for a job well done (sarcasm).  That was the only memorable thing from that restaurant and that's why I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I came here this past weekend for lunch. We didn't make a reservation, but there were still plenty of empty tables. Still, we had to wait around for a bit before someone noticed us and seated us.   We ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad ($20) and the Jumbo Shrimp Spaghetti ($22). I was surprised at how small the portion size was. If I had only eaten the salad, it definitely would not have filled me up. I was expecting more, considering the price of each dish. Taste-wise, however, both dishes were prepared well. The salad was fresh and the jumbo shrimps did not disappoint. The downside is that the spaghetti sauce was a little on the salty side. I ended up with a small pile of leftover sauce on my plate.  The service here was decent. The server was friendly, patient and quick to respond to our requests. Although the food was tasty, I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. It's always packed and happening around brunch and dinner. It's tough to find a seat if you're in a big group, but the mall makes it easy to waste away some time if need be.  The decor is classy and I enjoy the open kitchen design with its center piece wood oven that pumps out those delicious pizzas. The menu is large to match the size of the restaurant and the fair is typical. I'd say the food has always been tasty but has never blown me away. I had brunch here the other day and definitely enjoyed their take on french toast as well as variations on eggs (we shared plates). At times it's too rich, too spiced and salty, or just too overdone. Still, I'd say this is a place where you have find out for yourself whether you like the way they do food.  Service was prompt and accurate though not chatty or all that amicable. We were looked after more so than served.  One major downside here is pricing. I always leave feeling like I've somewhat overpaid for what I've gotten. Maybe they can drop their prices by 10%? Wishful thinking..."}
{"text":"This place has mediocre food. The service was fine, but the waiter never offered us any Parmesan cheese or pepper for our pasta."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and had quite a mixed experience. Service was decent, and the waitress was rather nice. The complimentary rolls were absolutely amazing, some of the best I've had. Ditto for the goat cheese dip appetizer. Very, very good. I ordered a side of fries and they were perfect in my opinion. Light and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. However, when it came to the main course, the grilled octopus, it was terrible. Not even edible. It tasted like burnt hair, and was slimy and mushy. I've eaten here before and enjoyed it, so I'm assuming it was just a one time thing, but, it was one of the worst excuses for food I've ever had and I'm including including jail and hospital food."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time recently and thoroughly enjoyed it. The food was very unique and fresh. The service was exemplary. The prices were what you would expect for a restaurant of this calibre. It's definitely worth returning."}
{"text":"I had a lovely lunch here with my mom before some last-minute Christmas Shopping at the mall. We were even seated a table away from the chefs who were eating there before a book signing. The restaurant is very nice: black and white tables/walls with large private booths. The restaurant was pretty full when we visited so we sat at the high top table in the bar.   We both had the soup and salad lunch special with mushroom soup and greens. The mushroom soup was nice and velvety, but made with no dairy! The salad was a bit disappointing. It was pretty plain and could've used some nuts or berries to spice things up a bit. The soup was also a little salty. I had a butter tart and a pot of honey lemon tea for dessert. I recommend the butter tart - it's a good size, is served warm, and the pastry is nice and light.   Warning: apparently they recently changed the menu and made all of the portions way smaller. Mom - who is a frequent visitor- said you used to get a whole bowl of soup, but they've since downgraded to a little cup. Same with all the sandwich combos. Good try O&B, you can't sneak anything by her!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way for this place!!  LOVE love O&B's! This location at Bayview Village is elegant and sophisticated, beautiful location. I have been to other O&B's before and the food no matter where I go the food is always exquisite.  Service is always on hand and pleasant. I will never tire of taking a trip to O&B's."}
{"text":"Never, never should any one go there. The food may be good and the service attentive, but it all amounts to naught.  The sound level at lunch or dinner is so high that you cannot hear or even communicate with the wait staff without shouting at the top of your lungs.  The sound level is actually beyond the legal limit for workers in Ontario. Employees are only allowed to work a maximum of ~ 2 h/day in this 90 dBA (average) environment)  http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pubs/noise/gl_noise_appb.php  To get value for your money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good things--awesome decor, well-priced food, great service.    Bad things--how frigging cold the restaurant is.    The three of us at the end of the table kept our jackets on all evening long because the front door blew in gusts of cold air every time someone opened it.  It's a busy place, so that happened a lot.  Unfortunately, it spoiled the meal for me--I was more than happy to wrap up and head out when the rest of my party was done."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious lunch yesterday and i was pretty satisfied. We reserved on Opentable and were seated as soon as we got there, although there was a lineup for non reservations.  We ordered off the $15 3 course summerlicious menu and it was pretty great value. My wife ordered an anchovy tomato salad, slow roasted veal sandwich, and chocolate lava cake. I ordered the same salad, a tomato seafood concoction as my main, and a lemon meringue dessert. Everything was delicious except for my tomato/seafood main which didn't taste like anything, but with enough pepper, I was able to put it down.  Our server was really attentive and we got a really nice seat by the patio. Keep in mind that the patio is in the parking lot of Bayview Village, but still.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"It started when the hostess walked away to do something else after asking us our name, party size and if we had a reservation. Not even an 'excuse me'. In hind sight it was foreshadowing of what was to come.  We split an over priced, under sized Caesar salad. No offer of fresh pepper was made.  Then we waited. We had ordered a prosciutto pizza and the seared tuna. We continued to wait. In all it took over an hour for the two mains to arrive. Our waiter did apologize a couple of times and offered us a couple of pieces of bread while we waited. Eventually the meal arrived.  The pizza was OK. The tuna was a surprise as I had expected that by being seared it would be warm. But no. It had been seared a long time ago and put into the fridge and intentionally served cold. Another surprise, another disappointment.  The only saving grace as that there was a special on the wine.  No compensation was made to the bill, just an offer of a free coffee which we declined since we were running late already.   I won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"This place has great space and atmosphere apart from this strength  the food is very mediocre and actually tasteless, over priced with absolutely no creativity and below average ingredients. Their most hyped about carrot cake is nothing but a bowl full of sugar and a factory made cake bought from metro or in the lines of these mass grocery stores. The cheese burger had no taste and thickness of a triple A Canadian , very disappointing and average tasting . Their pastas are just your average ready made and mixed up pasta in a big kitchen . One can eat far superior burgers and pastas at a much reasonable price at various places in TO . The Salads have absolutely no color and creative healthy sauce to it :-("}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Sat at 6:30, ignored for 20 mins, ordered food and never arrived...we had to leave for a show at 7:45."}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips tonight. It is not the first time and I remembered it was good. The fish was just right: crispy batter with a moist buttery fish inside. It was simply delicious. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Disappointing, and not that good.  Went for a Sunday brunch, the place was about 1/2 full.  I had the Huevos Rancheros, which were not poor but mostly tasteless.  Hard to imagine how the kitchen pulled that off with those ingredients.  My last meal at O&B was overly salty, and I had to complain about that, so maybe the kitchen hid the seasonings when they saw me coming.  Not enough food to satisfy, unless they think \"brunch\" is a meal in between a full breakfast and lunch, and not a substitute for both.  My companion had the breakfast plate but asked for no pork, and was served both bacon and sausage.  Pork is really something that a restaurant should be aware of.    Our server disappeared after taking our order, when the bill came there was another one.  So no drink refills for us.  How a restaurant manages a shift change at 1:00 pm is bewildering.  Coffee was good but cold, so not.  Washrooms smelled.  This was my second disappointing visit to O&B and I regretted my decision both times. In a world of foodies and food TV and interesting dining everywhere, it's hard to believe that a marquis name can get away with delivering an experience as mediocre as the one I just paid for.  I will be avoiding O&B from now on."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this place is not good. I thought it would be better than Origins, but it is much worse. First off, as a general rule, when a menu is really long with all kinds of random options, it's a bad sign. It went from venison to vindaloo to tofurkey. It's very confused and confusing. Second bad sign are unnecessarily huge portions of carbs.   We had the samosas (not good) and shrimp sliders (too much bread and just meh). For my main I had a mixed green salad with walnuts and and mandarin, and it really was horrible. My boyfriend had the octopus with kimchi fried rice, which was actually not bad. The octopus itself was quite nice, but the dish could have been way better overall.   Be careful, because the menu descriptions make everything sound amazing. At the end of the meal, for those dishes and two waters our bill was $80 after tip, so really not worth it. We kind of wished we just went to Thai Xpress next door.  I gave it two stars because I had to give at least one and the service was quite good."}
{"text":"My mother and I have a standing date for lunch, but finding somewhere to eat can be really difficult. I have serious allergies, and can't eat grain, sugar, or starch. Usually, if the chefs make accommodation, it involves removing all flavour and charm, and it makes for a pretty forgettable meal.  After bouncing around Yonge and Front for a while and getting sick from the food, we finally tried O&B, and I'm so very glad we did.  We go to O&B on a regular basis, and though my mother's meals have been hit and miss sometimes, my regular orders, the mushroom soup and the grilled calamari, are consistently amazing.   The mushroom soup is rich and delicious, and the calamari is not only great, but the seasonal vegetable rotation means that every time I go, I get something new. It's always delicious, but it never gets old. Even when the recipe was different, a putanesca, the kitchen staff was both meticulous about checking to make sure they weren't using anything that would harm me, but also made changes rather than just leaving things out. The diced tomatoes in the putanesca sauce were canned, and since they couldn't confirm exactly what was in it, they didn't use it. It seems obvious, but this never even occurs to some other places I eat at. At other restaurants, rather than risk anything, cooks just leave ingredients out (the best ever was a high-end place in New York that served me a \"caesar\" salad which consisted of dry lettuce leaves and a couple pieces of parmesan. I had to request oil and a lemon to make a dressing myself -- and they still charged me $12 US for it).   But at O&B, rather than just serve a putanesca without the tomatoes, the chef made me a wine butter sauce instead, so I still had a wonderful, delicious meal. After ages and ages of plain steamed vegetables with no seasoning served to me as \"accommodation,\" it was a welcome change.  The serving staff and the chefs have been almost uniformly wonderful about accommodation. I carry a list with me as standard practice for chefs to check and make sure that meals are safe. The servers are almost always gracious and understanding, and have no trouble taking the list back to the chef. Hearing that the chef remembers my order and will take pains to make sure it's safe is so gratifying, and takes a lot of the fear out of eating out for me.  There was only ever one exception. We were sat in the lounge/bar area instead of the main dining room, and the server seemed both irritated and impatient with my requests. When I offered my list, she waved her hand at it dismissively and ordered me to just tell her what I couldn't have.  Never, EVER do this to someone with severe allergies. EVER. It may be inconvenient for you to double check with the kitchen, and I appreciate that (and tip accordingly), but the consequences for me are one to three days of crippling pain that keep me bedridden. I CANNOT take that risk, and when a server flaps a hand at you and doesn't take you seriously, it means that the meal suddenly becomes a game of roulette. Only the fact that we had had the meal before without consequence prevented us from walking out, and our service ever since has been back to the stellar standard and kept us coming back, and is the only reason I didn't lower my rating.  When someone asks me where I want to go for dinner, O&B is one of my only two choices in the city. I can trust that when I go, I will get a delicious meal that is safe for me to eat. If they ever come up with a dessert I can have, it'll be a 5 star."}
{"text":"First few times were good. The last time I went was literally the last time I think I'd ever go here. It was my friend's birthday and I was left utterly embarrassed by the mediocre food and the horrible service. It took them forever to seat us, and the food took another 30-40 minutes to come (we ordered salads, not a buffet). No one checked up on us to give us water or anything, and at the end I tipped them NOTHING and the waiter had the audacity to ask me, \"ma'am, you do know that you should tip a minimum of 10%, right?\" I straight up told him, \"I know that, but it's also optional and based on service, which I didn't like, therefore, I am not tipping for a horrible experience.\" He quickly apologized and tried to offer us dessert, but the damage was done.   Perhaps they changed management, because I remember this place being top-notch at one point. Sad."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place when it first opened so i went to try it with some anticipation.  Here is the lowdown. Although you have to expect to pay a bit of a premium, the food and ambiance is totally worth it.  The grilled calamari is really amazing.  A must have. Along with their no cream mushroom soup.  I've had their shimp pasta and its very tasty.  I substituted the sauce with rose sauce (my favorite). Everything I have tried on the menu is good including the burger. The worst dish is the seared scallops - too salty and weird sauce that doesn't complement the dish.  The hostesses are gorgeous and look like they popped out of a Vogue magazine from a Gucci ad.  They eye candy doesn't hurt to look at especially when you are waiting to be seated.    I recommend reservations if you are a party of more than two. Unless you want to go to the patio where they don't take reservations.  A warning is that the noise is particularly loud on the patio and guaranteed you will find men in suits that popped in from the financial district. The douche factor may be higher here than anywhere else (except maybe Earls, which now is the \"it\" place and has \"hot hostesses/waitresses\").  If you want a trendy, upscale, modern, cozy hangout for a date or business meeting, this place is recommended.  I personally enjoyed every experience i've had there. Great date place."}
{"text":"Not our first time here, but likely our last. The service was slow and the food was bad.  My wife had a pizza which she described as the worst she ever had. The relatively new server, responding to our negative comments, suggested that the staff viewed pizza as hit and miss. Suggested if we ever come back, may want to try the salmon. This restaurant is a black mark on the otherwise good reputation of chef Michael Bonachini."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a number over the years and the both the food and service has gotten progressively worse. The last time I was there the greens were wilted and the sandwich was sloppy with very little meat. Poorly prepared. When bringing this to the attention of the waitress, she simply said that that was the way the chef prepared it. Something tells me that a chef should not be preparing food that's rotten and shoddily composed. A restaurant such as this should not be proud of mediocrity and an ignorant wait staff. The further response of the waitress was to email the manager rather than her dealing with the problem right then and there. A restaurant that cannot provide a workable solution right then and there (ie offer a better replacement dish), is not worthy of calling itself a good dining establishment. I was thoroughly disappointed that day. Oliver Bonacini should probably take a look into what goes on in his restaurants."}
{"text":"I always love going here. The food is great, the service is awesome and they cater to large groups which I sometimes find difficult in the city. I would highly recommend this location,its delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a five star because they have never disappointed in any way, and the food is amazing. I've bee here a number of times and they always have new and interesting dishes, some seasonal. I had the brussell sprouts with maple syrup, to die for. Also had the mushroom gnocchi which is out of this world, and the wedge salad is has generous avocado, blue cheese and bacon. The servers are very nice and knowledgeable about the dishes."}
{"text":"I was so looking foward to dining at O&B, but was very disappointed.  The service was extremely slow even tough the restarurant was only half full. The appetizers and salad were good, not great.  The presentation of the main dishes was nice but, four of six main dishes arrived at the table cold.  The mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes. A pasta dish was like glue.  There are many better restaurants in Oakville."}
{"text":"We had just finished shopping at Oakville Place so after being disheartened by the look of the food court we thought we would try our luck here. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and has a relaxed ambiance, not pretentious at all. The service was pleasant and surprisingly quick, we had our food within 10 minutes of ordering.  We ordered Arabiatta Pasta with shrimps which was amazing even if a little spicy. My husband ordered the Sunday Roast which lacked seasoning but was good nonetheless. For dessert we went with the Churros, they were served piping hot with a toffee dip.  I would love to bring family and friends here next. Its definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Have been going there for years and used to enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Have been away this summer and got to O&B few weeks ago after returning home from holidays ... What a disappointment!!!!!!!  Horrible food, seafood I ordered - scallops - were poorly prepared and definitely not fresh! The rest of my family of four were similarly disgusted with the plummeted quality of our favourite place...  Yes, prices are high, but that was justified by a really good food - not anymore!!! The only good thing to say - waiting staff is nice as usual... But with dropping numbers - (I am sure of it) they might start looking for a nicer place soon..."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! Fun patio in the summer. Excellent thin crust pizza. I prefer this resto to Canteen on King and Portland. The latter is better for salads and desserts."}
{"text":"2 stars simply for ambience/decor. Went for brunch with a gf and both of our meals were so heavily salted we had to return a portion of our meals. For the price, definitely not willing to return. #worsthomefries"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a drink with a friend. The cocktail menu was lovely - great selection and some really nice takes on old favourites."}
{"text":"Amazing patio, great service and tasty food.  They have a mac&cheese that is truly out of this world.  Would recommend for both lunch and drinks after work."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 star restaurant - I don't find their food anything special, but it tastes pretty good overall.  Normally I would not find it worth reviewing, but I did want to mention that I had a really good Thanksgiving Dinner there tonight.  The place was actually packed for a Thanksgiving Monday, and they were serving a traditional TG dinner which was turkey (you get white meat, dark meat and stuffing), with green beans, brussel sprouts, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy.  It was really quite delicious and convenient (the whole reason why my partner and I came here).  Dessert was a pumpkin pie served with real whipped cream and toasted walnuts.  My only complaint was that they really should include the dessert with the price of the turkey dinner.  Otherwise, everything was perfect -I think I would come back next year for Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to O&B for their Winterlicious menu. It was a good thing that we maded reservations for 7:45 pm as the place was pretty full. The service was great and the atmosphere was delightful.  As an appetizer, I had the Fried Chicken Tostada. It's made with iceberg lettuce, tomato, cripsy rice paper & tomatillo salsa. I was a little disappointed with the taste of this. The presentation was nice however it was difficult to eat. The chicken was extremely crispy to the point where the chicken was dry.

I was a little disappointed with the taste of this. The presentation was nice however it was difficult to eat with a knife and fork. The chicken was extra crispy to the point where the chicken was basically dry. The main dish that I had was definitely the reason that I gave this experience a 4/5. I had the Simmered Boneless Beef Short Ribs & Kimchi Fried Rice. It is to die for. The beef short ribs was so moist and full of delicious flavours that mixed extremely well with the Kimchi fried rice. I gave some for my girlfriend to try and she loved it so much that she wanted to order a plate of it!   For dessert I ordered the Mayan Spiced Chocolate Panna Cotta with pineapple & Vanilla crème fraîche. I was expecting it to have a very rich chocolate flavor however; I was pleasantly surprised at how light the dessert was. The chocolate wasn't overpowering and you could taste the sweetness of the pineapple and the fresh light vanilla crème fraîche which made the Mayan spice pop.  Overall, I had a fantastic time here. The atmosphere was pleasant. Our server was consistent with his service. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We had lunch there today. I ordered their classic burger and was absolutely disappointed with the burger. Yes, it  isn't a burger place but I expected a little bit more for that price. The burger was dry and burnt. The good thing is, they heard the complaints and took that off the bill. In short, don't order the classic burger there. In fact, I think they should take the burger off the menu altogether."}
{"text":"We were trying this restaurant for the first time.It seemed like a good place in the Bayview Shepard area, we walked inside the decor was beautiful. But, I was not at all happy. There was garlic in the water. The service was terrible, the waiters were ignorant and rude, our food took forever. The food itself was fair, it was greatly overpriced. The steak took 45 minutes and they were 10 minutes from closing. Not coming again. I'm giving the second star out of generosity. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Appetizers taste good but are a but pricey. Service is very slow. It has a corporate vibe and it is a perfect place to go for drinks after work. Those raspberry mojitos were perfect for lounging in the patio."}
{"text":"I came with a group of people during lunch. I order one of their three course prix fixe menu for $18 at lunch. The yellow pea and smoked pork soup was very good. I then had their Chive Pan-Seared Atlantic Salmon dish as the main course. The salmon was cooked well: nicely seared leaving the middle moist and tender; and the presentation was great. Some of the garnish could have been left off the plate. The presentation of the Mango Sorbet dessert was a bit of a let down but what the dish lacked in presentation made up for in taste. I would certainly return and try out more dishes."}
{"text":"I guess it's fair to say I had higher expectations of this restaurant because I love all the other OB restaurants that I've been to.  I can't say that I'll ever come back to the Bayview location.  The food was fine - nothing spectacular and nothing exciting.  I had the beef carpaccio and the mac and cheese.  Both tasted great, but also, nothing worth driving all the way for (around 40 minutes without traffic).  The biggest reason I wouldn't come back is the service. It was awful and slow.  We were literally there for 3 hours, and not by choice!  It took them that long to take our orders and serve us.  There were multiple occasions when we would ask for something, and we would watch the waiter go to all his other tables and have us wait for something as simple as a glass of water!  We asked for our bill and waited as he refilled everyone's water in his section before he even started processing the bills.  It was so infuriating and I will never go back again.  Not worth the travel or the expense.  If you're looking for an OB restaurant, go anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"The thing that surprised me most about this spot is how reasonable the prices are. We came for lunch and I had the Mac and cheese, which I recommend. It was so good and a large portion with chunks of chicken and little gobs of goat cheese on top of a panko crust. I couldn't finish the whole big thing and our server was happy to package it up for me. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals as well. This is going to be a new favourite spot downtown for me. I've been back a couple times since my first review and the service and food have been consistently great. I have to recommend the seared tuna which I've ordered twice and really love. Ps don't bother with the chicken wings, they aren't so great."}
{"text":"To bad there are no specials.  Food was good, not amazing but definitely good especially the onion soup. One of my favorite onion soups.  Staff was attentive.  Place looks great too."}
{"text":"The service is excellent at Oliver & Bonacini, however the food does not live up to its expectations, and the food is quite pricey. Even after the updated menu, the variety is still lacking. Last two times I went after the menu update, I ordered the butter chicken and a mushroom fettuccine. They were simple and the taste was acceptable, but nothing explosively savoury or very delicious. The foods served are quite special and the service is good, but considering the price and the bad sound insulation, in my opinion, I would only visit this place once or twice a year."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to O&B at BV for a while. The last time I had been there I thought it was overrated, overpriced and underserviced. I was so excited to see a new menu and give it another chance. So I asked for the chicken salad no onion, only to find out the greens are premixed with onions and they would have to handpick the onions one by one to take them out. What? What happened to fresh? O&B, such a well known, reputable restaurant and they premake their salads? Service was another story. Nothing has changed. The only reason this place has lasted this long, is because there aren't many restaurants in the area.  I will never step foot in the place again!"}
{"text":"Good looking restaurant with a good atmosphere.  They have 2 great outside patios.  One is covered by the building so still accessible when it rains.  The other one is \"uncovered\" and wonderful when it's sunny out.  I've sat outside on the \"uncovered\" patio for lunch and it's wonderful.    For this review, sat inside for dinner with 3 of my friends.  Wanted to sit out on the \"covered\" patio but they had the music playing very loudly.  Not sure if this is a Friday night thing because I've been there on Saturdays and there was no music.  We ordered the following:  Drinks Bloody Cesear Cosmo Vermouth Glass of red wine  Starters Cesear salad 3 mushroom soups   Main Classic burger Shrimp and scallop linguini Mac n cheese  Beef Short rib  Gelato 2 sweet nothing's Capoccino and biscotti  Total all included (tax and tip) $200 or $50 each.    Good service and good food.  One little issue: we ordered our drinks first but got our starters before our drinks.  Also, had to ask for bread basket.  Apart from that, all was really good.  Food arrived nice and hot.  Waiter was very friendly.  Price was affordable and pretty good for the portion we received."}
{"text":"Ended up here for brunch when we realized Origins North was closed.  The brunch options sounded so good it was hard to choose.  There were 4 of us and we each tried something different.  We ordered the $5 mimosas and they were good.  Servers were very attentive.  While we were waiting for our food a server accidentally dropped all the mimosas he was carrying for a nearby table.  One person at our table was splashed with the mimosas.  It wasn't s big deal but they apologized profusely, brought napkins, and offered to move us.  We opted to stay as it really wasn't a big deal.  Our mimosas were comped which was a nice thing to do but we were not expecting that.  Our meals came quite quick my and were delicious!  We all enjoyed what we ordered.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and if I had one complaint it would have been to have it a bit more spicy or provide hot sauce / salsa to taste.   We planned to order coffee as well and maybe dessert however our server had one more surprise for us.  He brought over a sampler plate with 4 really amazing desserts and comped the dessert and coffee as well.  Completely didn't expect that but it was a really nice thing to do and honestly the desserts were phenomenal!  Would go back for coffee and dessert alone!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself has great decor so that makes for a nice atmosphere - but the food is really average. I was disappointed! I had the chicken dish - it really wasn't good at all; VERY SALTY!  Although I will say the sweet potato fries were quite good. My husband had the fish and it was again, salty.  The food experience was underwhelming at best. I actually wish Druxy's was still there - that place was a winner and the pastrami sandwich was my favourite."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Great ambience. Small portion.  It was during summerlicious, however we just ordered some main courses individually.   The shrimp & crab cake tasted amazing. Would hv been more reasonable priced if the portion were larger.  Overall, it's a great place to hang out with groups of friends."}
{"text":"Just went there yesterday. I ordered the short rib on polenta and fried onion. The polenta was creamy and was delicious the beef needed  more gravy or may be on the side. It's worth a try. My daughter had steak and lobster..she enjoyed it. Dessert I had butter tart..have had better. The brûlée my daughter had was delish! Service was fast and good."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, usually for late/early lunch when it's not crazy busy and crowded. Highly recommend their classic burger, fish & chips, sweet potato fries. Pastas and pizzas are almost always good, but everything else is hit and miss. Their past few winterlicious/summerlicious menus have been disappointing though. Still, would love to try their brunch some day."}
{"text":"Patio and restaurant was beautiful, and the staff was excellent!  Came here for Summerlicious Lunch 2015 and ordered the following:  - Clam Chowder - Was very good, but too liquid for my liking. It would merit 5 stars if it was a bit thicker. They were generous with the ingredients in the soup (veggies, mussels, clams etc). 4/5 - Jerk chicken quesadilla - WAY TOO SPICY. It was way to spicy to enjoy, BUT it was still very good. The coleslaw complimented and toned down the spiciness. 4/5 - Peach and Apple pie - 5/5. Don't ask why I gave it perfect, I just did because it deserved it."}
{"text":"I like this location a lot.  Great for casual dining.  Friendly and attentive servers.  Large portions. Love their baked mac & cheese. Like their soups & salads as well.  Really good location."}
{"text":"The line a few doors down at Fran's was long so a friend popped over to see if there was a line at O&B and how much more expensive it was. There wasn't a line, it appeared to be a little more expensive and we were short time so we went to O&B.  Meal: I started brunch with the mushroom soup because that's how I start all meals at O&B and jump and it didn't disappoint.  However, the meal went downhill from there.  The Challah French Toast (with caramelized bananas, hazelnuts and maple syrup) sounds delightful and reasonably priced at $14.  It tasted great. Except the 3 pieces of french toast were each the size of half a broken hot dog bun (so essentially getting 1.5 hot dog buns). I get that quality is more important than quantity at places like this but brunch should not be a 5 course meal.  The flavours were right, but the size was not.  Finally, I also had a cheddar scallion scone because I LOVE the one at School Bakery. But here at O&B, it came out burnt from a toaster and cold inside. Worst of both worlds.  How much I paid? About $30. So it turns out that it was actually a lot more expensive than Fran's.   If you're looking for somewhere \"safe\" in terms of cleanliness, location, parking, transit, and not having to line up, this might be for you. But there are tons of other places that serve a far better brunch So I wouldn't recommended going there if you're catching up with friends or looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"Overpriced and food was underwhelming. Paid just over $100 for food that is certainly not worth the amount paid for family of 4. Also waited for about 40min to receive our meals.  I personally got the chicken waffle. 2 tiny pieces of chicken :'("}
{"text":"Went here for a typically meal on a Wednesday night around 9. It was a little quiet, since it was a little later on a Wednesday night. We were seated at our seats and was quickly greeted by our server Andrew shortly after. He did a great job introducing the drinks and specials and was fully enthusiastic the whole time. He convinced me to get a curry dish (I forget the name of) from their world inspired curry Wednesday daily special. The curry was alright, wasn't the best but also wasn't the worst. I've been here a couple times and food was always okay, but this is a good place for larger family gathering to just get together and have a family meal.  Overall food was average, and service was amazing."}
{"text":"Rating O&B 3.5 stars  Patio alone in the summer time is a 4.5 stars for sure! I've been here a couple of times now for both dinner and brunch.   For dinner: I had the mac and cheese because it was very highly recommended but i was disappointed. It was a great portion and perfectly baked cheese crust at the top but the flavours and the creamy sauce just weren't satisfying enough. The abundance of peas was quite overwhelming and actually distracted me from enjoying just a hearty mac and cheese. For me, this would probably be a whole different dish if it weren't for the peas.  For Brunch: I wasn't very impressed with their brunch menu which is served until 4 pm - i would've had liked a little more selection. I had the eggs benedict - perfectly poached eggs and runny in the middle. I substituted the ham with spinach on the scone. Although perfectly cooked, it was low on seasoning for me - it definitely needed a kick of something to make it more satisfying and flavourful for me. The home potatoes it came with were cooked perfectly and the seasoning was perfect and quite unique.   They have a convenient and quite the perfect location and for the reason and to try everything else on their menu I would return here again."}
{"text":"Reading all the mixed reviews, I was not sure what to expect when my friends suggested we meet here for lunch on Monday.  I work VERY close by, but surprisingly this was my first time dining there (save a few nibblies after work or in the evening).  Anyway, I decided to go for the mac & cheese.  I generally like to keep mac & cheese pretty plain and simple, so I was a bit sceptical about the added peas and chicken.  But I have to say, it was delicious!  One of my fellow diners opted for the same thing, but added bacon, and we both devoured the huge dishes.  I understand they do a great burger, so another one of my fellow diners had that and enjoyed it too.    The service was friendly and efficient.   My friends asked for the bill to be split four ways only after receiving it as one bill, and the server was quite obliging.  I would definitely return.  I found most of the menu items to sound a bit heavy for lunch, but I'm pretty sure the mac & cheese will be my go-to anyway!"}
{"text":"Hmm... O&B is supposed to be pretty good, isn't it? I didn't have that great of a food experience here though.  I came here for their Summerlicious dinner. Since some of my coworkers had mentioned O&B before, I thought it'd be a good place to try out.   I had the lamb starter, chicken breast soba noodles for a main, and carrot cake for dessert.  The lamb was good. If it were a main, I would have gone for that for sure. It was nice and moist, and had enough flavour to it. Perhaps I'm a little biased towards it though because it's meat (and I like meat).  The dessert was all right. I got their carrot cake, which tasted pretty good. The cake itself wasn't too sweet, but the whipped topping made up for it.   The chicken soba noodles was disappointing. I guess that's to be expected when you go to a European restaurant and order Asian food. The chicken was too dry, and the meal was served cold. To be fair, our waiter did mention that it would be a cold dish, but the chicken still wasn't very good.   I would have given it a 3-star overall (since the food wasn't THAT bad, and service was decent), but they did something that really irks me - they charged tax on top of the tip! I went with a large group, so I guess they automatically charge 15% gratuity, but they charged 13% tax for the meal total + the tip. That's not how it works, and any restaurant that does that automatically loses a point for it.   I wouldn't recommend the place, but to each their own. Maybe if I had another main I would have enjoyed it more, so if you're here for Summerlicious, avoid the Chicken Soba. Go for the fish instead."}
{"text":"mah, this place is a convenient place to hop to afterwork and has a nice big patio but my oh my serves such a mediocre food. I didn't like anything I ordered. The fish was fishy, nachos or sth was not hot or warm enough. Nothing memorable other than a server who moved from BC where I was visiting from! I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Drinks took a very long time to arrive.  Main course came before appetizers (they forgot our appetizers).  Utensils were taken away before we were even done with our plates.  We wanted dessert, but our waitress was mia. Food was mediocre, service was ridiculous. Would not recommend to anyone to come here."}
{"text":"Great patio and location (if you work in the financial district).  Lame beer selection though."}
{"text":"Oliver & Bonacini have taken over the former Shopsy's building that occupies so many of my childhood memories. In close proximity to the four seasons center and the Royal York hotel, the location is popular with theater goers, conventioners and tourists in the evening, and the usual Bay-Street-lunch-meetings crowd at lunch.    Food was really good and the decor is very nice. Our server was very friendly, the waitstaff was organized.   We sat in the dining room at a round table top for four. It is pretty, and bright. The ambiance was pleasant. Taking advantage of unique lighting fixtures and open space.   I had a spinach and apple salad with toasted pecans, which could have benefited greatly with more apple (two slices). It was boring. The tomato and bread soup, however, was delightful with little sprigs of basil. Would have been delicious cold (like a gazpacho) as well.   The onion Rings we shared were about as good as battered onion can get, served with a somewhat watery blue cheese dip.  From my position at the window, I had a good view of the tables around the dining room. It was packed on a Sunday night right before \"Billy Elliot\" and staff seemed relieved that we were not in a rush to eat before the show. There were a couple tables of families with disgruntled and underdressed teens, some theater goers with short skirts and bright lipstick, (Obvious) blind or internet daters, tourists. None of the other diners gave the impression like they were regulars, like they fealt they belonged, like they were completely invested in the experience, like it was totally comfortable. I think that leads to the funny vibe\" mentioned here.   Service, although good, was also very slow. I understand we came in right as the theatre goers were leaving, but ordering a glass of wine took 10 min and receiving it another 10. We did not order until we had already been seated almost half an hour.  It was ok, as my group wanted to catch up and were not in a rush, but by 8pm we were hungry and had demolished the bread.    Mains are in the $20-$30 range."}
{"text":"uggh i am so torn - i really wanted to give them a five! service was AMAZING (i love Oliver and Bonacini Bayview Village). I felt that they went beyond what was needed, by doing some fairly simple things. It's really too bad that the food wasn't (one of the dishes we ordered sucked).   When we got there, it was really busy, but the hostess got my name down and gave us a buzzer thingy - very pleasant woman. we walked around for a bit before heading back. She remembered my name when I went to follow up :) (not that it's hard to - i think we were the only chinese people in line, but still!)   \We were shown to a nice roomy booth ^_^, server gives us some time with the menus. we decided to get something from their brunch menu and something from their lunch menu (get something from their brunch menu if you can!!).   Server swings by - gives us the fruit drink specials - blueberry/mango/orange, peach lemonade, kiwi passionfruit.  I ordered the blueberry/mango/orange; boyfriend ordered peach lemonade. blueberry/mango/orange was SO YUMMY!!!!! definitely recommend it - it was light and not too sweet. The peach lemonade was too peachy and not lemonade-y enough.   food:   Poached eggs and BBQ brisket: RECOMMenDeD!! (with hollandaise sauce) - flavourful, fresh vegetables used, eggs poached just right, amazing sauce combo. try this :)   shrimp and scallop linguini not recomended: pasta was undercooked, it was missing that one mystery ingredient that would've made it more flavourful :( . shrimp and scallops were kind of tasteless.    all in all - it was a great experience :) great service, food is usually great (i really miss their giant scallops - don't usually like scallops, but they make it taste so good)."}
{"text":"Best service I've experienced in a while. Server was very knowledgeable about the menu. There were four of us for dinner and we all had something different. Everyone enjoyed their meal and drinks. I am not a wine drinker but there was mention at the table that the wine prices were a little high, but wouldn't deter anyone from returning again."}
{"text":"Came here after another recommendation from my hotel. It was a quiet night so we were seated promptly. The hostess staff was friendly and attentive.   I ordered the duck breast based with speatzel and greens. The greens were cooked just right with a little bit of crunch to them still.  Just how I like them.  The speatzel was perfect and probably the best I've had. The duck was just okay. It wasn't gamey which was great but it was a little tough to cut up.   Would love to come back to try the other items here."}
{"text":"I'm having trouble even giving this place 1 star.  We went here for lunch.  They were having a special prix fixe menu.  We had the gnocchi.  It must have been bad.  I'm not sure, we both felt nauseous after the meal and my wife actually puked in the parking lot.  At first we thought maybe it was something else, but than I realized I too was feeling sick.  This place has great decor, the staff are pretty attentive, its unfortunate the food sucks.  Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The worst experience from this chain stores. Definitely not baby/kids friendly ! The waiter served hot food over a 1 year old baby's head while we asked him to serve the dishes on the other hand of table, he refused at first and become very rude till we insisted."}
{"text":"O&B brought their resto know-how to a great area lacking in options for brunch/meals-in-general. Sure, you could make the drive further south to downtown Oakville and battle it out for a spot for eggs, or just show up at Oakville Place and park somewhere in the giant lot and be seated without too much trouble.  The place, like all O&B ventures, is decorated beautifully like an upscale country club complete with wire art reminiscent of Caulder, high ceilings, cookbooks abound and an open kitchen. However, this wonderful atmosphere (and generally good food) is thrown off by lacklustre service. Sure, weekend brunches are possibly one of their busiest days, but the wait for attention and food is juuuust enough for people to start doing the impatient look-around-and-see-where-your-waiter/coffee/food-is move.  Brunch is your run-of-the-mill breakfast options with class - eggs benedict, fancy sausages, granola, eggs, etc. with prices being around average-mid for what you get (though the granola and yogurt is noticeably expensive). Altogether, O&B Oakville has all the right ingredients for an enjoyable weekend meal - a solid fallback option when you've run out of ideas."}
{"text":"Great Service Great Food Decent Price  Went here for the first time as a diner with a friend of mine, we went on a thursday night at 8pm an recieved great service an took pictures with the chefs and line cooks in house. Plan to come to dine in all of O&Bs' franchise in the near future.  Tip- Best times to come are 4-6pm for fresh an quick food with servide or 8-10pm :)"}
{"text":"My wife, son and I eat here regularly. We order different dishes from the menu each time. We often have to special order for my son and the kitchen and wait staff are always accommodating. The food comes out quick and is of good quality."}
{"text":"Great 2014summerlicious lunch $15.00, beautiful presentation, fresh, big portion, will come back again!"}
{"text":"Came with my girlfriends, very busy for lunch on a weekday! Recommend making reservations like we did.   My groom soup was tasty and I loved their crab cake entree! Best I have had ever. It won't make you full but you will be content. If looking to fill yourself up, I would order the crab cake as a starter instead and add another entree or dish.   Great atmosphere. Food took a while but it was worth it."}
{"text":"- tasty food with decent choices - professional friendly staff - reasonable price point  - convenient downtown core location - decent patio"}
{"text":"It is an Ok place to eat. We went for dinner on Mother's Day. Service was good. We had to wait a little more than usual for the food as the restaurant was full. Small selection of beers."}
{"text":"A group and I ventured to Oliver & Bonacini before an event at the ACC recently. It's in a great location if you are going to a concert or sporting event there, so the convenience was great. The restaurant itself is gorgeous inside and our waitress was friendly and informed. Three people in our party were allergic to gluten and she was accommodating and knowledgable about what entrees were best and allergen free.   The food itself, however, was not necessarily anything to write home about. I had the mac and cheese which was good, but rather watery at points. The breadcrumbs were only crisp and distributed on one half of the dish, which was disappointing. The portion is also incredibly large and given the richness of the cheese, impossible to finish. I did, however, have the fresh juice of the day, which I believe was grapefruit, and it was delicious.   I may go back again if I'm in the area and need to have a quick dinner as it was not horrible, but for the price I was definitely expecting something a little better."}
{"text":"I have been to this place since it opened years ago and every time I go (most times against my own volition) I am more and more disappointed by the service and the food. O & B attempts to present itself as an upscale restaurant with great food and service and they fail every time. I have been there when I asked for brunch eggs Benedict on their \"homemade scones), where after half an hour the server came back with my companion's food and told me: we are out of the scone, would you want me to serve you the egg on a bagel??  A few weeks ago I went there for yet another brunch with a friend, the server completely forgot my coffee, took forever to bring the milk for the coffee, and when I ordered scones and asked for jam or butter or something to eat with it, he brought me the typical packaged strawberry jam and butter you get at Cora's. Talk about confusion!! They want to pretend to be classy and serve high quality food (they certainly charge you that way) but the packaged jam and butter was really the last straw.  I have more terrible stories about them over the year for every time I was dragged there for one reason or another, but I will save you."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice and trendy patio to hit up this spring, Oliver and Bonacini on Yonge Street is the place to go! They have a gorgeous patio, with very comfortable seats and a great atmosphere. Dined there a while back and was very impressed. The service was outstanding! I have been to this location and the one on Bayview, and the Yonge Street location is 10 times better when it comes to service. Had I not dined at this location before, after the service I received at the Bayview location I was never going to return to O&B again. Our server at this location was very outgoing and attentive and gave us some great suggestions. Had the gourmet mac and cheese, which is just heavenly. and paired it with the Jacob's Creek Moscato. I was very impressed that they had Moscato on the menu, not very many restaurants in the Toronto area do. ."}
{"text":"Recently went with my in-laws. The meal was absolutely delicious. The service was phenomenal and a great, quiet atmosphere.  Our only problem was that when they brought all the steaks over, they mixed up which went where. I didn't care and inadvertently ate my father-in-laws, oops!  The great staff at O & B quick prepared another for him, and had it on the table in just a few short minutes."}
{"text":"What a great experience compared to a not so good experience at O&B Canteen.  See my reviews for details.  Anyway, stopped by here before the Rod Stewart concert for dinner.  Restaurant was busy with pre concert and pre theatre crowd but service was impeccable.  Food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  I had the salmon entree and loved every bite.  I'll definitely come back to this O&B."}
{"text":"I had actually heard not so great reviews about this place so avoided it for a while but I finally went for my graduation party (yay!) and loved it!  The staff were very attentive (but not over the top) and polite. Our food was on time, served beautifully and tasted amazing!  My friend is a salad guy so we all ordered a salad to start and I had bite of all the different types they had - all amazing! Their blue cheese iceberg wedge is phenomenal....I just became a salad person...probably for the best  5 starts for O&B Bayview location yay!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that the service was great. The restaurant was packed and our server, Amanda, was helpful, friendly and quick, especially since she was probably slammed with tables. My complaint is with the food.  I got the winterlicious menu. Not because I wanted a deal but because I'm vegetarian and I didn't feel like eating mac and cheese (their veg option on the regular menu). The Gem Lettuce and Tuscan Kale Salad with a Mushroom Barley Risotto sounded like a nice meal. But when the salad arrived, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. It was a romaine salad with three tiny pieces of kale. There was a blob of store-bought creamy blue cheese dressing on top, and spiralized carrots with a few nuts. It looked like a cafeteria salad you'd find in a nursing home. It looked like the sad salad you'd make yourself on diet day, the one you eat grudgingly. It was definitely not a kale salad!   Then came the mains. If you're going to put something unusual on the menu--mushroom barley risotto, in this case--one would assume you've come up with a tasty recipe. But this was disgusting. The only flavour in the dish came from the sparse blobs of cheese, which I finished in three bites. The barley \"risotto\" was slimy and flavourless. The mushrooms (button mushrooms, nothing fancy) were slimy and flavourless. They must have tried to add the crunch with the vegetable chips they put on top, but there was no saving this pile of vomit (yeah, honestly, it looked like and had the consistency of vomit). I ate the chips. So thanks, O&B, for a dinner of six chips.   My tablemates didn't fare that much better. The nice-looking tart my boyfriend got as an app (again on the winterlicious menu) was cold. Who serves a cold roasted vegetable tart? And the lettuce on my mother's burger--this one from the regular menu--was wilted and rusted.   The only good thing about the winterlicious menu was the banana tarte tatin, the only dessert made in-house, and I'm so thankful our server recommended it. The rest was the worst meal I have ever eaten in a café, diner, restaurant...really, the worst. I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"Everything starts with an expectation .... if you start with the expectation this is a Cafe and Grill attached to a mall then this place is ok. If your already at the mall and need some place to eat then sure this is a good choice. Think burgers and the like. I ordered off the Winter Fixe menu which was priced at $28 for dinner. I had the Calamari with endive and fennel. It was ok, a little tough and a little bitter. Serving was a good size portion. Almost too much. For the main I had the mushroom and ricotta cannelloni which was ok. The highlight of it was the tomato sauce. The mushrooms were chopped up into a puree and not a whole lot of flavor. This from a guy that loves mushrooms. The ricotta also did not have a lot of flavor. I didn't even bother finishing it. It was just bland. For dessert I had the cheesecake. It was again ok. All in all the meal was good, staff were attentive, and the ambiance quite nice. For the money I think I would go elsewhere (unless I was already in the mall). I won't be rushing back ... Set your expectations and order appropriately."}
{"text":"The O&B Café downtown is certainly in a prime location.  So after having lunch here three times over the last two weeks, I thought I'd share my experience with everyone.  After all, if you work in the downtown core, it's a popular choice, so you'll  likely end up here sometime soon.  One of my favourite dishes at O&B is their mushroom soup ($5.95/cup or $8.75/bowl).  The earthy pureed soup tastes creamy but doesn't contain any butter or cream. To contrast the smooth texture, O&B tops it with snippets of chives and enoki mushrooms.  The soup is of course served piping hot, which is welcomed during the cold winter season.  The mains, on the other hand, have always been decent but never exceptional.  Some of the recent dishes I've tried are:  The breakfast pizza ($14.95), available on their weekend brunch menu, is topped with caramelized onions, maple glazed ham, cheese and a sunny side-up egg. The crust is thin and chewy but because of the uneven distribution of toppings (too heavily concentrated in the centre) the middle becomes soggy and gross.  In keeping with the breakfast these, the egg is useful for dipping your crust into.  If you're hungry, their chicken burger ($15.25) is a large and is accompanied by a generous portion of sweet potato fries.  Topped with bacon (soft and not \"crispy\" as noted on their menu), cheese, crisp romaine lettuce, a thick slice of beefsteak tomato and red onions there are certainly a lot of flavours and textures.  Expecting the chicken to be a piece of chicken breast, I was surprised when it ended up being a chicken mixture formed into a patty. Although the patty was juicy, the consistency was a bit soft for my preference.    During the latest visit, I tried the seared cheery snapper tacos ($15.95). Mixed feelings are abounding for this dish.   I enjoyed the plethora of sauces filling the tacos - avocado crema, sweet bbq/mole type sauce, tangy pineapple chutney and a dish of sour cream made each bite flavourful.  It also had great texture from the mix of coleslaw, sliced radishes and cilantro (albeit wilted).   But, improvements could be made to make this dish better.  Firstly, the store bought tortillas have got to be changed.  Understandably, O&B is not a Mexican cantina but sourcing hand-made tortillas can't be that difficult in the city!  Secondly, the fish to toppings ratio is dismal given I could hardly taste the pan fried snapper; the coleslaw to fish ratio must be revisited.  Thirdly, what I like about Mexican food is the heat!  The three thinly sliced pickled jalapenos is simply not enough. Lastly, please invest in metal taco stand/holders.  Indeed, I enjoyed all the sauces, but after finishing my first taco, the second tortilla was soggy from being saturated from the extra moisture.  O&B, I can assure you that guests do not like soggy wraps that leave hands sticky.  If you're not afraid of insanely fat and calorie-laden dishes, you should try the O&B macaroni & cheese ($15.95).  A shallow dish filled with elbow macaroni drenched in a creamy, buttery, white cheddar & Gruyère sauce.  As if that weren't enough, pieces of roasted chicken, peas and dollops of goat cheese are mixed throughout.  I suggest ordering with an entrée salad and sharing with a friend as the dish is very rich.   Overall, I've always liked my order, but with the exception of their soup, have never ordered anything I'd want to have again.  Perhaps, for O&B Café & Grill, food is not the big draw.  Rather, it's their central location, substantial dining area that can accommodate groups of any size and the professional & efficient service that attracts their patrons.  Whatever the attraction, O&B continues to be a popular lunch destination."}
{"text":"I loved the food. The portions are not too big, and not too small, just he right size. The dishes we had were delicious, presentation is beautiful. The place was full (it was lunch time on Sunday), but they could accommodate us right away.  The server was too salesy I felt, and offered her opinion on our facial expressions when we declined the desert :-), but other than that she was helpful and polite. They didn't have soy or almond milk for late and cappuccino, so that was my only complain. We had to go across the mall to get our coffee."}
{"text":"I have been here once before for Winterlicious and decided to come back and try their brunch menu on a Sunday to compare the two experiences. Overall, I'd say the biggest downfall of the restaurant is their level of service.  I ordered their shakshuka since I've never seen it on a brunch menu anywhere else thus far. It is a \" a dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, chili peppers, and onions, often spiced with cumin. It is believed to have a Tunisian origin.\" according to wikipedia. O&B's version also comes with a lot of baby spinach which is a great touch. My thoughts on the dish was that the tomato sauce is far too acidic meaning it overpowers all other subtle flavours of the dish. The feta cheese adds a lot of good flavour and texture but there wasn't enough of it. The dish comes with exactly ONE piece of toast cut in half that was a little bit on the burnt side. It is also sweet with a crumbly texture. I ate the dish with the toast scooping up the tomato sauce, baby spinach cheese. Unfortuneately, because the tomato sauce was really sour, more toast was definitely needed in order to finish, so I had to order a side order of toast...which still came out burnt by the way.  The poached eggs on top was definitely the best part of the dish, cooked perfectly, no complaints there.  We also ordered their signature eggs benny with smoked salmon, not the best we've ever had but still very very good. We thought the portion size was a bit on the smaller side though. But the chives scones under the poached eggs was amazing (you can also order this on the side)  What I really loved about this meal was the coffee they served, what I thought was just normal brewed dripped coffee turned out to be a very rich and aromatic cup of joe. I was thoroughly impressed.  As mentioned above, the sevice was just a disappointment. I have been to a lot of the other restaurants that O&B owns and this by far is the worst service I've ever recieved. The staff did not seem genuinely happy to see us (they were not weeded, the restaurant was NOT full) or to serve us. Everything was very minimalistic, and they seem to be just going through the motions until their shift was over, and it was VERY apparent in their demeaner and attitude. The server assistant almost threw the toast onto the table without looking at us and then walking away immediately. Our server was the same gentleman I had back when I came for Winterlicious and even back then he seemed MUCH more patient and happy to be there...and they were jammed packed back then. I did not make any complaints or special requests at the table so I was very disappointed when they treated us this way.   Our bill came up to about $23 a person with tax and tip. I thought the price is fair, given the atmosphere, location and we did not have to wait at all for a table and that they accept opentable reservations.  Would I come back? Yes, but only if I'm looking for this particular type of brunch and if I'm going to bayview village that day regardless. I would not come back specifically for the food."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for my brother's birthday with my family on the Summerlicious menu.   For appetizers, we had the calamari salad and the chilled honeydew mint soup. For entrées, we had the veal, sea bream and gnocchi. Lastly, for dessert, we had the lava cake and meringue. The food was excellent with interesting complementary flavours.   We also tried their cocktails, Sicilian Summer and Passion Kiwi Sour, and had to say that they were a perfect match for the hot summer season.  As well, the service was great... until our waitress, Felicia Colp, began using generalizations when chatting with my family. At a higher-end restaurant like O&B, we usually expect higher standards in service. However, they really lost points when our waitress spoke down to us as though we didn't speak English and proceeded to suggest that we shouldn't try the sweet and sour chicken because we \"probably have that all the time at home\".   Besides that, the ambience, food and service was great. However, the noise level can get very high so I wouldn't recommend this place for someone looking for a quiet Friday night dinner."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Oliver & Bonacini Cafe Grill Cuisine: Italian & International  Location: Financial District Address: 33 Yonge St Price Range: $15-25  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 4  Extra information:  *Couple locations in Downtown Toronto *Huge patio *Good for group gatherings *Reservation is a must *Financial district crowd  Ever since I arrived in Toronto, I've been hearing about Oliver and Bonacini. I assumed it was something like the glowbal group back in Vancouver that owns restaurants such as Italian kitchen, coast and etc. Those places are almost always guaranteed good food, service and atmosphere so I was excited to try it out.  I went around 12 in the afternoon of a regular weekday for a lunch. There were 3 people at the front desk and they were all very friendly with greeting us and finding a seat for us. It was completely empty inside the restaurant when we arrived but because we didn't make reservation, we had to sit in a corner that was by the door which was open to their outside patio.  It was kind of chilly but either it was that table or the high chairs and I HATE high chairs so we stuck with the seat. They also gave us an option of sitting outside, but it was 14degrees and windy and there was no way I was going to have lunch while shivering.  They have a big bar area and the inside is beautiful with spacious seating area and interior decoration. I've passed by their patio many times and it is quite nice perhaps for summer time or after work drinks while the weather is just right.  Ordered: SMOKED CHICKEN AND MUSHROOM PIZZA 4/5 *Most expensive pizza on the menu for $19 plus tax (around $23) *This is made with a thin dough (italian style) *Decent size for one person *Maybe a little too big for girls to finish unless you are starving *Smoked chicken pieces shredded on top of the pizza *Fresh aragula on top as well as mushroom pieces *Distinct Truffle flavor which I enjoy *Strong cheese scent *Thin crust and strong flavored toppings made this pizza balance very well *I enjoyed every bite of this pizza and would order it again  Ordered: ROCK SHRIMP LINGUINI for $14.95, 3/5 *This was quite small in portion *There wasn't much shrimp  *Pasta is cooked just right, but nothing like home made pasta like Terroni or Donatello. *Fresh olive oil drizzled on top which was quite flavorful  Service was very good at Oliver & Bonacini. Like when I just thought of asking for more water, they were there to fill it up. Plus their water is ice cold which I love. Luke warm water is one of the grossest thing ever!!Also note that it's mostly it was the financial district crowd in their suits and high waist skirt having business lunches.  Summary: This place is def pricey for lunch, but if you are in the area for business meeting- why not give it a try? Also it would be very good for cocktail/beer drinking after work. I think I might go back for dinner during the weekend so I don't feel so left out in my regular clothes."}
{"text":"The servers are very nice. And the room is very nice. We had some perfectly nice calamari to start. Not inspiring. But, you know, they were squid, right? And they had some olives or capers or other tiny pickled humpers to accompany them. Maybe a bit tomatoey. I might just be imagining puttanesca squids...but no...no...if I'm honest that's what they were. It was good. It was a perfectly fine regular squid dish. At this point in the meal, I am like: \"Sure...this is the most shamelessly chainlike and charmless part of the O 'N B empire, but damn'd if they aren't professional about things.\"   On to the burger. If you got served this boring, dry,  gray burger at Jack Astor's you would have been like: \"Sure...this is Jack Astor's...and I'm at fault for having walked through the door...but I thought the burger would at least be greasy enough to make me feel bad about myself.\"   A good place to go if you don't eat much or like food, but would like to hang out in a slick and civilized place that pleases young and old apparently. I suspect that they could deliver some competent food if you ordered something a bit more $$$$, so the burgie was a mistake."}
{"text":"Saturday night is usually busy in any restaurant but the poor service we received on May  14-th was not justified. Our servers were only interested in what we should order for drinks . The music was so loud that we could not here each other talk. Finally  the server did come to take our orders.  I ordered the mushroom soup which had a strange taste, Cesar  salad, totally tasteless and pizza fungi. The pizza was just terrible, covered in some strange flavored melted cheese and a few mushrooms soaked in balsamic vinegar.    We had to wait at least 30 minutes for coffee. I spoke to the manager about the less than mediocre dinner and he smiled sweetly not a bit interested to talk about it.  Our dinner guests felt the same way, the restaurant has gone way down hill and needs major improvement.   Good luck!"}
{"text":"I visited this place for a friend's birthday. I was immediately impressed by how beautiful it was. The decor was well thought out, artistic and classy at the same time.   Service: We had about 20-25 people and the reservation/ seating all happened without a hitch. With a large group like that, I was impressed how organized they were with the seating. We were assigned one server with few other staff helping him.  He was very friendly and highly professional, not to mentioned organized.  Food: The food was delicious. I had the Spicy Italian Sausage Penne and did not regret it one bit. It was very good, the meat tasted fresh and the sauce was also well done. Their Sangria was also amazing. (P.S., the free bread and butter they give is glorious!).   I will definitely visit this place again. Only problem is that it's a bit pricey but it was expected."}
{"text":"I was there last weekend with friends for dinner. I had the seafood linguine which was okay but not very impressive. Nothing special about it. Also the service was below our expectation. We reserved days in advance but got a table that was just beside the entrance, in the way of everything, and the server was very inattentive the whole time."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Oliver and Bonacini Cafe Grill. It's located at Bayview Village. I decided to give this a try because of Winterlicious 2017 menu was priced reasonably at $28 and that free parking is always great!  When we first got there it seemed like it was very busy for a Wednesday night. The restaurant was packed and we heard that for others for a party of 2 without reservations was a 45 minute wait. Since we made reservations we were seated immediately.   We took our time with the menu and finally ordered. Our food actually came instantly. I think because they were shelling out the same 3 apps, same 3 mains, and same 3 desserts. We literally ordered and then the food showed up almost instantly. I ordered the seafood chowder. It was good.  I then ordered the braised beef gnocchi. It was my first time having gnocchi and it was wonderful! The braised beef was a little dry. I suspect that it was made and sitting under the lamp for a little bit because my plate was very hot when it got there.   I finished with a chocolate torte. It was also delicious, but it was a tad hard. Overall the meal was great, but the portions were a bit small. I was not full when I finished my meal. Neither was my friend whom I ate with.   Also on Wednesdays is half priced bottle wine, but we didn't end up ordering. It was $40 for a Jacob's Creek Moscato White Wine. It costs $12.95 at the LCBO and even with half price it was still 40% more than retail cost so certainly not worth it.   For $28 dollars it was really worth it, but the portions could be a little bigger or they could add some extra gnocchi pasta to fill you up. There was probably 6-8 pieces of pasta only and the rest was veggies. I would only come here for Winter or Summerlicious. Their regular menu is not really worth the cost."}
{"text":"I'm from Honolulu. I'm here attending a convention. Had a solo dinner at O & B Cafe last night. The menu looked very \"Pan Asian\" -- so much like what can be had in Honolulu, so I ordered my martini and pondered whether to stay or go. I stayed because the 'waitperson': Morgan was so upbeat and pleasant. She also recommended a couple of dishes that happened to be the ones I was leaning toward sampling (if I stayed). Long story short, what I had was excellent (curry coconut soup, lamb burger). Best of all, I am posting because Morgan is a gem! She  converted my 'should I stay or should I go' to a 'stay and try'. I'm happy I did. Here's a big hug and positive shout out to Morgan!!"}
{"text":"Not many restaurants I've visited have been successful at doing fusion, this one is no exception. Was disappointed that even the basics of rice was not achieved. Great tasting jasmine rice should be soft, moist and fluffy. One does not need a great chef, but simply a rice cooker. Sadly, my rice tasted hard and a day old.   So what does one do when you're unhappy with your meal? Switch with your friend of course! Yeah, that wasn't memorable either.   Place is over rated. Will not return.   Not recommended."}
{"text":"No idea why o and b has a tattie scone on its menu. It seems out of place. I think most would expect to see a british scone. Anyway, no comment on the tattie scone. My pic of it speaks volumes. Smoothie bowl was fresh and cool - though overpriced. My friend had the huevos rancheros and was happy with it. I had it once before and recall it being what you expect with that dish so that is good as I dislike experimentation on traditional breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"I came here last week for dinner one evening. Our server was so friendly and on the ball.  We ordered tacos to start, the NY strip which is served with a Boston Bibb lettuce salad, sweet potato fries on the side, cocktails and sorbet to end the meal. The meal was great from start to finish.   I'm not sure why they'd have a steak on their menu with a salad side, but I guess it's for those Paleo or Atkins people. Anyway, I wanted the NY rather than the filet because the former has just so much more flavour so I just opted to get my fries on the side rather than order the filet and frites. My steak was a perfectly cooked medium rare and the sweet potato fries were crispy and addictive. The lettuce salad was lettuce salad (In my book, not terribly interesting and probably more appropriate for bunnies and hamsters. I don't hate salads, it's just \"lettuce\" salad is so boring. Give me a tomato salad or a kale salad or a quinoa salad).   The Roman Mule cocktail was a stronger version of a Moscow Mule. It probably wasn't a good idea because I'd been dealing with a sore throat and that super potent potable sent me into a coughing fit. Get the Pomjito. It's yummier and not scratchy on the throat."}
{"text":"It's just fine.  Nothing special, but nothing great."}
{"text":"Due to the location this restaurant is a common corporate meal option. I've been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and the best way to describe it is as putting in the absolute minimum amount of effort to milk the location. Drinks are extremely overpriced ($8 for a 16oz pour or $16 for a cocktail) and food is just ok although slightly more reasonable price wise. The restaurant itself feels somewhat poorly maintained if you pay attention to the details, things like properly working faucets in the restrooms.  I would not recommend this restaurant, with so many options downtown your money would be much better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Spring rolls was pretty good, cod was a bit raw/cold in the middle. Server was too cool..... As if he's doing us a favour."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss at O&B.  We come here frequently as it's conveniently located at Bayview village and it's family friendly.   Most of the time the food is good, so is the service but we have had issues multiple times with unprofessionalism and sub par food.  I would say it's great more often than not but there needs to be more consistency.  They always accommodate and are very friendly towards our toddler."}
{"text":"Despite the negative reviews our experience at O&B was good overall. We ordered mushroom soup, baked oysters and fish tacos. All appetizers arrived promptly and were fresh. Our entries consisted of Sunday roast special and lemon chicken, again fresh and tasty. Service was prompt and friendly . No complaints, we were pleasantly surprised"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast easter weekend and I did expect better food. I've heard lots about this place and it did not live up to its hype. It was mediocre food at best with plain salads and egg meals."}
{"text":"If you booked 7pm for dinner and you came 40 min early, don't expect them to give you a table even the restaurant is half empty for 1 hour. We did that and the waitress at the door told us to come back in 30 min. Its not like the restaurant was full or anything. Also for a party of 2 people we weren't missing anyone when we went early. I guess they just want you to be punctual...  I think this place is okie. It is located inside a mall, which is pretty good because even we came early, we can just walk around and kill some time before our dinner.   I have to say their bread was hot and tasty. I like their pork shoulder because it was very soft and held it shape. Overall, I guess they were alright minus the punctual thing for booking."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior made me have high expectations but,  How in the world are they charging $27 dollars for their short ribs there? For that money I say buy yourself a slow cooker for $27 bucks and make your own short ribs for better- hell throw anything in your in your slow cooker and it will be better then this- if it is worse, you don't know how to use a slow cooker- just use google to find a recipe.  Short ribs were not tender, lacked any depth in flavor and had unmemorable sweet potato shaving (thought it was bacon, which put a smile to my face, but that smile turned into a frown on my first bite). The food wasn't terrible, but for $30 bucks, I expect a lot more. Wine was good though, so I decided to drown myself in that to make up for the night"}
{"text":"I had a great time here. The wait line was a bit long but worth it. The food was excellent, as I had the fish in a tomato sauce with fries, my friend had the grilled calamari with fries, and for dessert the creme brûlée. Portions are quite small as it costs more than regular Moxie's or Milestones. However, the crowd is mostly the financial district industry (well around 6 pm on weekdays), which was sophisticated. The interiors and decor are elegant. Customer service was great, and overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"Not impressive at all. Decor looks cute, and it's a classy looking establishment. Service was good in the beginning and waitress was attentive while we waited for the stragglers in our party to arrive and was interactive with the kids in our group. The food dishes however were subpar, and for that price point we expect food to be quality. Steak was over salted, pasta gave a member of our party food poisoning. The pretzel bread that came with the crab dip and the desserts salvaged part of the dining experience. Beyond the location, not worth going to again."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that such a great restaurant could be attached to a mall. The food and service were both excellent. Finally somebody is smart enough to serve small dessert items when you just don't want a big dessert. I tried both the italian sausage pasta and the pizza. They were both well prepared and flavorful. I highly recommend this restaurant. Tom"}
{"text":"My first meal in Canada, and it was scrumptious!  My Canadian friend loves the celebrity chef here, and so we visited of few of them during my stay.  We came here for lunch and I had the beef carpaccio with truffle oil and mushrooms.  It was huge and delicious.  The restaurant itself is nice and clean, and their specialty seems to be fresh, seasonal ingredients.  On the pricier end, but very tasty!"}
{"text":"After a day skiing and boarding, we were sitting in the lodge debating where to go for dinner.  We wanted something satisfying and upscale to reward a hard day on the slopes but not pretentious, so we decided to go to Oliver & Bonacini.  Walking in still wearing our snow pants and jackets that rustled as we walked, we were greeted warmly and shown to our table.  I got the Pork Shoulder ($26) which was braised to fork tender with a plum sauce and barley risotto, while friends got the Cajun fish, salmon, and octopus with kimchi fried rice.  What I notice is that most of the dishes have a bit of an Asian flair to them which was surprising, but pleasant.  I could honestly say I was stuffed by the end of the meal, and all the mains were executed quite well.  The servers were very busy on a Saturday with all the tables, but they managed to remain poised and we had a nice conversation with our server at the end of the meal as things were quieting down.    If you're looking for great service and a place to have a fancy meal without being stuffy, then this place should be on your shortlist."}
{"text":"This place is great! Their Fish and Golden Yukon Fries are SO amazing, Huge piece of fish and thick cut fries! Very satisfied with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nothing exceptional and nothing bad either. It's not terribly priced or anything either, but there are just much better places out there.  Also when we went, it was super busy, but the service was not very good. Although our waiter was friendly, we had to wait a REALLY long time to tell him he forgot our drinks, and it was very difficult to wave him down when we needed anything.  The mac and cheese was pretty good. The roasted potatoes they serve with just about everything is really good. They use really good peameal bacon. They overcooked the eggs in my eggs benedict which is a big problem -- I've never had an overcooked egg in this dish before, its absolutely fundamental to properly poach your egg!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to think of this restaurant. It's the only immediate 'fancy' restaurant within the area (Bayview Village), but hoping the new Origin will turn it in tip top shape.   I came here post renovation with a girlfriend to catch up. I have been here for dinner on several occasions and it's mostly been an average experience (food and service). Nothing wow or spectacular.  I made reservations on Opentable and everything went smoothly. I was brought to a half chair/half booth table (booth like seats line the wall, while your partner sits on a chair). This was a bit awkward as, on either side of me, all the guests had put their coats and bags basically on my seating area. I was fed up. You clearly see me coming and you don't move your stuff. So I just sat on the clothing and bags and sustained stares. Then, I pushed the stuff aside and put my bag and coat on top. Whatever... (I hadn't eaten so the fangs came out!)  Our waiter was really great! I think he loved serving two girls and started asking questions like: Where are you from, when I was waiting for my girlfriend to arrive he asked if the seat was for him, and he also said we both had beautiful smiles!  I always loved O&B's Tuna dish which was sort of like a Tuna Tartare with Avocado. I thought I had ordered that, but the Tuna Tataki I got were actually tuna slices with fruit. Major disappointment. I ordered 2 glasses of the Chardonnay which made the night better.  Overall, anyone can do better than this chain. However, it does fill the wine and dine scene so I guess it will just have to do.  15/30"}
{"text":"An obvious choice for a business lunch or dinner before a show, I actually went for brunch and was pleasantly surprised. As always the staff was incredibly kind and helpful (and not too hard on the eyes if I don't say so myself...). We got a good table on their enormous Yonge Street patio because it was a bit rainy but would have happily sat on their Front Street patio had there been sun. I had a great eggs benny and fresh squeezed juice that will knock your socks off.  I don't even like brunch, so to be won over is a coup - one which O&B can safely claim to have made."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant located inside Bayview Village Shopping Centre.  A group of us came here for Winterlicious.  Didn't expect the portion was going to be big since it is at discounted price but the quality of the food wasn't bad.  Me and a friend ordered a mojito and it turned out to be salty.  After drinking half of it then we realized something must be wrong.  We asked one of the waiter and he came back and told us the bar mistakenly mixed up the sugar with salt.  The waiter placed it for us.  This turned out to be the joke of our evening because I thought the salty Mojito was this restaurant's special recipe."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick drink after going to the Sony Centre for a show. The restaurant was quite empty but the service was extremely slow. The drink I ordered was the tropic thunder. It tasted great but don't think I would return due to poor service."}
{"text":"Went here last night and we were seated immediately. Draft from the -35 weather outside didn't help as we were seated close to the door. The couple beside me were saying it was very chilly in here. Boo!   Ordered: Red Snapper Tacos (appetizer) Jerk Chicken Pizza  Stuffed Cornish Hen  And dessert.  I originally wanted the Chicken Supreme but they ran out. How do you run out of Chicken? Ok, just ended up ordering Jerk Chicken Pizza.  Service was good to begin with but we got our bread at the same time as our appetizer. Tacos looks good, tasted great. Gauc in the tacos was fresh! This was good.   The timing for the entrée arrival was good - we were done the tacos. The Jerk Chicken Pizza was massive! The Scotch bonnet sauce was awesome. The portion was enough for two light dinners/lunches. It tasted great. The Cornish hen was ok, small portion.   My water was empty for most of the night, our server was very very inattentive. It took him easily 20 minutes after we finished our entrees to bring a dessert menu and then the bill was another 10 mns. He was setting tables at midnight while we were waiting for our bill.  Overall we spent over 2 hours here!! Honestly wasn't the great. Food is good but please only go here if you have a whole evening/afternoon to waste."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself looks a whole lot nicer than the mall. A great addition.  The menu has a wide selection of food, and unlike what Oscar says, they did have specials when I was there, you just have to ask nicely! They are mostly of the \"traditional North American with an Asian Twist.\" I had the Lamb Burger, which had an awesome dressing (was it tzaziki?) and sweet potato fries. It was great!  We went for a birthday party and were glad we grabbed reservations. While we were there, we could see the staff in the larger event room having training on their latest addition to the wine list. Maybe that happens elsewhere, but I've never seen it happening before. Our waiter had already tasted the wine, described it well (even though it was not my fave), and could direct us to the winery. How often does that happen?  I wouldn't say this is a \"child-friendly\" restaurant, but there's plenty of room for strollers and highchairs. Unlike a lot of restaurants in Oakville, it's actually accessable for people in wheelchairs and walkers (no stairs or levels, no tricky doors, accessible washrooms) Grandma will love it, especially because the prices don't break the budget.  Why four stars? Because the waiter was great, and we had a blast!  Great for that Downtown Oakville feeling, but north of the QEW."}
{"text":"Tried the special dish of the day. The meat was over cooked and dry, the dish doesnt worth it's price. MY wife had salad with salmon very small and dry dish. It's not my first time at that place but this time it was really bad."}
{"text":"Loved. Food, service and ambiance. But especially the service. The waitstaff was lovely. They went out of their way to accommodate my group of 10. The potstickers were very yummy and the carrot cake is to die for. My coworkers had the Saturday special surf and turf and said it was delicious also."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow here and they weren't even busy. It took about 35mins for our meals to come out and nobody came to check if we needed anything - we had to wait to flag a waiter down. We then ordered dessert (cake and coffee) and it took half an hour to get to us - how long does it take to pour brewed coffee and cut a slice of cake? The waiter kept telling us it was coming in five mins..and then told us that again ten mins later. The food was mediocre, the wait was not worth it. I can't imagine how they would survive on a busy night. This was my first time here and I definitely don't want to come back."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious with a friend and we were impressed with the dinner menu.   I ordered: The wild mushroom focaccia, the simmered beef short rib, and wild blueberry and lemon cake.  The focaccia was really nice, except for the side of pickled vegetables. Nobody should be eating pickled anything on an empty stomach, especially when it's not pickled in house and looks like its been taken out of a jar.  The short rib was delicious, I wish it were warmer though. I loved the potato puree and peas, just the perfect combo.  The wild blueberry cake was not only too sweet, but very oily as well. I can't say that I enjoyed it.  Compliments to our amazing waiter, Andrew. He was a true professional and full of great energy.  Overall not a bad experience for Summerlicious, with a few tweaks it could be perfect."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We tried it again after poor performance last time. Used to be a great place. Everything we ordered was bland except the lemon chicken which was acceptable. Steak was a poor cut and not well cooked. Fries were hard. Nicoise salad was bland. Crab and cod cake was dry and had big chunks of shrimp in it. Service is not the problem here. They are really good. It is the kitchen. Oliver and Bonacini have a problem here and if they don't fix it they will pay the price."}
{"text":"Went there for Saturday brunch today. I ordered a bowl of Tomato soup $9, Ceasar salad $13, asked the Waitress to add a grilled chicken breast, $9 extra. My wife ordered Salmon Ceasar $26.  I specifically asked my soup to be steamy hot, when it was served, it was not as hot as I liked. The chicken turned out to be roasted drumstick plus a bit more, not grilled as I asked for grilled chicken breast. The texture of the chicken was soft, not firm and no taste. My wife did not comment on her food. The bread was the best part of the meal. The waitress was friendly but she did not ask if I was satisfied with my food, as she saw I only ate 1/3 of the chicken. Total cost with 15% tips $74.07. No desert or any drinks, just water. The place was full at noon time. So I guess most people must like this place. Would I go back? Not if it's up to me."}
{"text":"Honestly, if I wrote this review a couple years ago, I would give it 1 star for bad food, little portions and bad service. However, with my recent visits, I was surprised how much they have changed since then.  On my recent visit, I came here for a special occasion. I ordered the mushroom soup in a cup and fish and chips. The mushroom soup had great mushroom flavour as they did not add any cream into the soup. The fish and chips portion was massive and the fish itself was cooked perfectly. It was lightly battered and the fish was moist. I was quite surprised that O&B can deliver such a great dish.  Our server was great. She constantly kept refilling the hot water pot and was attentive on what and how we were doing on our meals. This place also has free wifi so thats an added bonus.  Also on other visits, I tried both their summerlicious and winterlicious menus for the past two years and the menu and food were both wonderful. Salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce that it came in complemented the fish."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto for its delicious and varied menu that is unexpectedly fairly priced, especially given the elegant ambiance and well mannered staff. I love that they have many gluten free options and replacements. You can start with a surprisingly delicious gluten free bread. This restaurant is not a secret though, so you are better off making a reservation."}
{"text":"This place is \"Meh\"!  This is an okay place but if you're a visitor to Toronto, there are much better, local restaurants, within a 5 minute walk. Check out Yelp for places nearby. This is part of a small chain and some locations are much better than others- this location certainly isn't the best.   I've been multiple times and the food is hit and miss here and the service is okay but certainly nothing special...  .....it's truly disappointing restaurant for a \"MasterChef Canada\" judge to put his name behind."}
{"text":"My friends took me yesterday for my birthday brunch.  Amazing and fast service. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our party of 12.    We have ordered off the brunch menu.  I ordered avocado toast 10/10 very flavourful and side salad was delicious. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict without the ham and those were the best eggs Benedict I've ever had.  Perfectly poached eggs on a cheesy tea biscuit!!!!  Everything was delicious.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"Even though Oliver and Bonacini is a chain, I really enjoy their brunch.  Keep in mind that these are the same owners of Auberege Du Pommier, Canoe and Luma.   It is on the high end for price but the quality and care that goes into each dish separates it clearly from its counterparts.  Waffles are not just waffles and crepes are not just crepes."}
{"text":"You won't get quality food for the value you will pay. We ordered two steak-frites and 2 drinks, came up to $100. While eating their version of steak frites I couldn't help but reminisce about another restaurant only 10 mins away where I had great steak frites the night before during a business meeting. The dessert was good, just wish the food had more flavour. They were understaffed and had one food runner manage 10 tables in a row, I don't blame the guy for mixing up the orders more than 3 times at our table, I blame management for not providing the best customer experience."}
{"text":"wonderful waitress, beautiful ambiance, yummy food and bottomless mimosas. can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"My friend and I are always visiting this restaurant for brunch Sunday after our gym session:) . Their egg benedict was phenomenal which is our regular dish at O&B. Service was great as well. The miso glazed salmón was also unforgettable, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!! This is going be a long review and you better read on. This restaurant  puts Peter Oliver and Michael Bonnacini to extreme shame!!! Wonder what will Michael Bonnacini do when he was blind folded and tasted the food in his restaurant??? This was my second visit to the restaurant, first time was for breakfast which we were not happy but thought dinner might be better.  A group of us had a dinner last night and didn't like anything about the neither the food or the service. My husband had BBQ steak and tasted like as if they microwaved steak. I had so called their best seller COD and the fish was cooked perfect at the first bite but the inside was not cooked. Some had Jumbo shrimp pasta and pasta was over cooked. Oh, one thing cooked right was the sweet potato fries and the beets salad. Service was so  horrible and we all felt like they have no system of serving. The food arrived and server didn't know where food needed to go so asking everyone at the table where supposed go. Not just one, anyone who ordered same food had exact same. I ordered Afogato as a dessert and arrived very last second when we were about to ask for a bill. Wonder how one scoop of vanilla ice cream and the espresso took more than 25 min!!! With no apologies from server at all. Presentation, it was served in whiskey glass that was chipped on rims.... I completely lost for words!!! Waitress didn't even wrote down anything... otherwise, salads with dressing on the side were never made to the table that way. After the math, they put 18% tip where we had no choice because we were a group. No I am not done here. Once we came home, my husband, who had their \"famous\" mushroom soup and the BBQ steak started to get sick and stayed in washroom ALL NIGHT!!! How this as \" unforgettable\"?? We traveled from very far thinking that we would have great dining experience, at least like cafe and grill, like the part of reaturant name, but we all swear that we would never come back to this retaurant again. I am a big foodie who traveled the world tasting food around  the world, but you don't have to be a foodie to assess type of food and the services being offered here. There are many great restaurants in Toronto, but not this one. Save yourself a trouble, you will get better food at McDonald's."}
{"text":"The first time I went here it was a little slow and I was worried about the quality, but that worry was for naught as this place is pretty satisfying. One of the many O&B restaurants (obviously Lol) in Toronto, this particular one seems to focus on more on safe family style comfort food rather than anything more adventurous or high end. The prices, however, ARE a little on the high end for this type of food though.   Luckily it mostly seems to be worth it. Everything I've tried here has been fairly excellent. The Mac and Cheese is creamy, delicious and recommended, and the pizza is satisfying too. However, it is a little on the high end price wise for this type of food to make it an easy go-to recommendation."}
{"text":"At the lower end of the Oliver & Bonacini line up, it is clear that this restaurant is not the focus of their culinary excellence. O&B's food is just OK, with standard dishes you would see at your typical western restaurant. The environment is inviting, and it has the capacity to cater to large groups, which makes it a great spot for a lunch or dinner with friends or family."}
{"text":"It was a Monday family dinner after work, right at dinnertime of 7pm. We saw a number of tables on the perimeter of the restaurant, some already midway through their food. My grandparents had visited the location upon invitation from friends just the past weekend and enjoyed the experience, so we thought a repeat visit would be a good choice.  We were seated timely and our server was kind and promptly took a drink order after telling us about the fresh squeezed juice, though she neglected to inform us of the drink special, chef's pizza, and chef's main of the day. As we put in our food order afterwards we were informed that the portions are small, so we got two cups of soup, two orders of calamari, and two orders of Caesar salad to share with a party of eight - four women with mid-sized appetite, and two seniors with small appetites. We all got our own mains except the seniors who shared one, which we figured would be more than sufficient. Mains we ordered included the fish and chips, spaghetti, chicken penne, spinach and ricotta ravioli, chef's pizza of the day (pickled red onions, chicken breast, fresh peach, mozzarella cheese), and Korean style fried chicken.  When the food arrived, everything looked and smelled great. We dug in happily and there were no complaints. About halfway in, we were feeling satisfied and had no further complaints. But then, everything started to cool off and all around the table we had one comment: too salty. The pastas had rich sauces and as soon as they settled they were too salty to the point we didn't want any more of it regardless of whether we were full or not. The pizza lost its initial hype with the peaches because there were so few tiny bits of peach, and mostly it was mozzarella cheese on white sauce on a thin crust. The fish and chips were nothing to write home about.  The dessert menu is simple - white chocolate cheesecake, molten lava chocolate cake, carrot cake, lemon posset (kind of like a mousse or pudding), gelato and sorbet, and creme brûlée. We got the cheesecake and chocolate cake to share, and they were nothing extraordinary. My first impression of the cheesecake was mediocre, and entirely not smooth enough. The molten lava cake had a moist texture but the cake itself lacked dimension in flavour - it felt a bit like brownie mix. The gelato offered an affogato option on the menu for $10, and this upset me the most because two scoops of gelato went for $7.25, and a double shot of espresso went for $6.25. That adds to $13.50 for effectively two affogatos, while one went for $10. I thought, perhaps they prepare their affogatos differently, perhaps there's the caramel bits I enjoyed so much during my visit to Milan, but nay - it is vanilla gelato only with one espresso shot. My server didn't even mention there's vanilla flavoured gelato! Rarely have I had dessert be the most memorable disappointment of the meal.  We said our goodbyes after the meal and went our separate ways home, but not before I noticed a quick rush by multiple individuals in the party to the washroom. Similarly on my travel home I felt an uneasiness in my stomach, confirming I will likely not return to the restaurant.  Redeeming qualities of the meal include the ambiance of the restaurant - nicely decorated and clean, well lit and not crowded. Their daily specials are good deals, and their mushroom soup is an excellent non-cream, non-flour mushroom soup option. The pizza crust was thin but not hard, even at the end when it'd all grown cold. Their fresh squeezed juice was indeed tasty, even if for the volume the price was much too steep. There was more of the menu to try, and the overall price point was affordable. The kitchen was organized and prompt as well, and we got in and out in a reasonable time. For the same price there are many other options in town."}
{"text":"Nice waiter and service but the food was not good. Ordered the Mexican chicken salad and couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was during winterlicious. The winterlicious menu was so awful that I barely finished my food.  But since it's in my neighbourhood and I've heard some good things about it, I decided to give it another chance. Unfortunately, the regular menu items were also terrible...I don't remember exactly what I ordered, but i remember hating pretty much every item. I came here with 4 other friends, and we tried at least 2/3 of the menu. Will not return. I'd rather go to milestone or moxie's (which I consider to be mediocre at best )"}
{"text":"I have been there yesterday for lunch with my friend, and we were disappointed about this place.  The food was OK, but the service was unprofessional and really slow. My friend was not that hungry, so he ordered a cup of soup and a snack. However, the server herself decided to set the soup as my friend's main dish, and she served the soup at the same time with my steak without asking for our concent. By the way, she also misplaced the size of the soup. In addition,  we have been waiting for around 40 minutes until we had our mains.   I will not go there again, because I did not receive the service that matches the prices, and the taste of food does not convince me to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Very positive experience here with a large group on Saturday night.  Service Over Phone: I booked a table for 14 for Saturday at 6:30 pm about 10 days in advance.  They were friendly and able to reserve a high chair for a child.  Service At Restaurant: Friendly, professional, laid-back, and not disruptive at all.  We needed to add an additional 2 people to the table and they added an extra table for 2 to the end of our table without problem.  Best of all, they were able to do separate bills, also without problem.  Our friends with a baby and stroller appreciated that seating wasn't so squished; the stroller was easily accommodated.  Food: Reliable as always, unpretentious and good value.  Portion sizes were medium-to-large, and I wish I had room for their carrot cake which is delicious (and huge!).  Atmosphere: Energetic but not too noisy to chat with friend.  A must-have for a large get-together.  Overall a wonderful time -- thank you O&B for being reliable as always."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with my last visit. In my previous review I was pleased with O&B's consistency, but they completely failed in this aspect this time.  We ordered the chicken & leek potstickers to start. It took over 20 minutes for this one dish to come out - not really an unreasonable time to wait, but the time really started adding up after this.  While waiting for the potstickers, a couple was seated next to us. The potstickers were ok, but they didn't taste as good as before. We also noticed that the couple next to us received their order of potstickers at the same time as us, even though they ordered at least 10-15 minutes after us.  Things only went downhill from here. It took another full hour for our entrees to come out, although we were kept entertained by the events of the table next to us. They had ordered a steak dish and a salad, both of which had to be returned - the salad was the completely wrong order, and the steak (which was ordered medium-rare) was so well done that the man couldn't even cut into it. The waiter also never returned to their table and the couple got so frustrated they ended up walking out.  We had trouble flagging down our waiter to inquire about the status of our dishes, but we managed to talk to the manager, who promised to check on our food. They came out about 10 minutes later - in total, it took around 70 minutes for our food to come. I wouldn't have been as unhappy if the food had been good, but unfortunately my fish and chips just weren't up to par. The fish batter and fries were soggy, the coleslaw sat in a puddle of watery dressing, there were burnt black bits of leftover fries from the deep-fryer, and the fish was mushy and not fresh.  We didn't want to risk our luck by ordering dessert. Fortunately our waiter gave us the bill promptly; it should be noted that no apology or any attempt to remedy the situation was made; at the very least, we would have liked for someone to have apologized for our food being so late, or a free dessert/drink to be offered.   In summary: not too sure if I want to return here anytime soon. This last experience has really left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"If I could show my review to this place without giving out at least one start, I would do so.  The fundamental problem of this place is the service and quality of the food which are literally the only core value of a restaurant.  Service is bad in the way the waiter ignore our request until we had to yelling out.  They also messed up out to-go for the left overs which we found out the next day. Food, highly salt and oil concentrated which make you thirsty after eating. Drinks, 2/3 of the sangria was ice and there's just no taste of red wine and the color is transparent, for a price of 1.5 of regular drink you would get else where.   If you really need a last min place on a busy Friday night, good luck with this choice.  Otherwise, think twice for  the experience you expect to get and for the money you pay."}
{"text":"i've been here on many occasions, and while the service is always friendly, it never meets the standards i think that O&B should try to attain to stand out. anyhow, this particular past thursday, the food was actually stellar (though very, very slow arriving to the table).  i ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and gnocchi mushroom special. both were fantastic.  sadly, surprising. surprisingly good! i hope they keep it up in the kitchen. so good that i would regularly frequent when i know i've got time to wait for my food.  in sum: go not too hungry... it will build while you wait for some excellent dishes."}
{"text":"Pretentious place with more focus on being fancy than the quality of food. Service will be guaranteed awful if you are dressed casually. Went there for brunch once with my sister and a British accented waiter acted like a haughty butler. The breakfast was also just ok for the price we paid. Next time went with friends and had a generic mass produced beer for lack of any better options. This time at least the service was better but the food was still pretty average tasting and bland. Tried a few forgettable appetizers and I think it was pizza for main course but nothing worth remembering or coming back to, especially for the price."}
{"text":"I like the modern look of this restaurant. Been here a few times and the food is always good. I tried the Mac and cheese, turkey burger, various sandwiches and the steak Frites. All were very good. Service is fantastic every time. The place is really busy and had to leave on a few occasions because I didn't have reservations. Also a great patio spot in the summer.... and early fall as they have heat lamps. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here for a dinner with colleagues as it had been a while since I last visited an Oliver & Bonacini restaurant. Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations. The service was extremely slow, and rude at times.  Specifically, it was not until the end of our meal that the server checked to see whether we wanted more drinks.  The meals were delivered to the table by people who had no clue who ordered what (to a group of 6).  One server in specific was particularly dismissive and rude when delivering the romaine salads which he called by a completely different name and acted like we were from Mars when we didn't know what he was trying to deliver (and he had no clue who he was supposed to bring them to).  I tried the Mac and cheese, as apparently it is highly recommended. Mi didn't really notice any cheese curds or goldfish crumbs which were described on the menu, but there were plentiful green peas within.  It wasn't the decadent Mac and cheese I was expecting from a restaurant.  I likely wouldn't return, there are many better restaurants with more attentive service to try."}
{"text":"This spot is a welcome change to the eyesore that used to occupy the corner. The setup is nice and modern and it does get packed on weekdays (especially the patios) on a nice day. Some friends were meeting here for a quick snack so I decided to join in.  They have a Cigar friendly patio so my main reason was to come here was to enjoy a drink or two while having my stogie. The beer is selection so standard that it is painful. Liquor/wine selection is much better.  Prices are inline with this stretch of dinning spots.  This being a weekend an odd time for a meal the place wasn't that busy but the friends said the service was not up to par. I will update the review when I have had a chance to try the food here as well."}
{"text":"Went during a busy weekend (Valentine's Day) with my wife... had to wait over 1.5 hours for main course. Service was poor. To make things worse, the (expensive) food itself was very bland (I had the salmon) and the 12oz steak my wife ordered was ok but undersized. Location is good but spend your $$$ elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great service without a doubt.  Decent space, though not particularly romantic (some harsh lighting in spots).   I've eaten there twice and while the food is fine, it's not something I'd return for.  Tonight I had a flatbread with goat cheese and eggplant and tomatoes. I think it was fine, but I'd suggest that it if it had been grilled, served hot, and maybe with a lemony dressing (as an example), it would have been a much better experience.  Similarly, the kale salad was okay, but the dressing was overly vinegary.  Nothing wrong with a simple oil/vinegar dressing, but it's also not something I go to a restaurant to experience.  Overall, very friendly, respectful service with so-so food."}
{"text":"I've been going to O&B for years now and I continue to go, so I must like it right?  Food and Service is consistently good at this restaurant. Lunch specials are great and the wine selection extensive.  I love the exotic fruit juices, yummy!"}
{"text":"Food was OK, and place had a nice ambiance during the early evening our group of five visited before a concert at the Sony Center across the street. I would have rated the place 3-4 stars, but then we got the bill and saw that each of us were charged $3 for water. We inquired about this with the waitress and were told that it's because they served us their special filtered water. None of us are \"water connoisseurs\" so we couldn't tell the difference. No one asked for the filtered water but because we had already consumed it we had to pay the $15 charge, which is ridiculous. Very disappointed when restaurants pull off nonsense like these to extract a little more money from consumers. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Came here with the parental units last week for lunch at 2 pm.  The hostess immediately assumed we were tourists with no money and no class and stuck us in the back of the lounge, so as to not disquiet the local business crowd.   I had a cup of the Apple Parsnip Soup and the Turk Pizza (spiced lamb, hummus, feta and summac)   The Soup: It was okay, nice and creamy, competently done but nothing exceptional. 6.5/10  The Turk Pizza: Spicy, and the summac was a nice touch. Big portion with 4 slices. 7/10  My Mom had the Steak Frite which was okay, except the fries were very very bland. 4/10  Service was pretty hit or miss, and the initial conversation with the hostess really set the tone 4/10  Again, this kind of place is hard to rate. The food is okay, but when you get into these price points, you want quality you cannot reproduce at home."}
{"text":"I had the arugala prociutto pizza and it was delectable and super great. A friend of mine reccomended this plave and I see why. Really friendly staff, I did not feel like a burden whatsoever. I am definitley coming back here."}
{"text":"I came here for a family bday dinner on a Sunday night. Even with the auto-gratuity the service was great!   The food was very good and the atmosphere was inviting. We were a party of 9 and almost all of us were very happy. They even gave my two young nephews a tour of the kitchen at the end of the meal!   The only thing we didn't love was the octopus dish."}
{"text":"I recently went here for a small, intimate wedding reception/lunch (29 ppl including bride and groom) in the private room. The restaurant itself and the private room where very chic and nicely decorated. The two servers that were working our room were great. Super helpful, very friendly, and super accommodating. One friend has a severe allergy to all nuts, which we had informed them of before hand, and they were eager to make sure everything was good from him. On the day they also spoke to him personally to discuss options and make him feel comfortable that they were all aware. Great service in that regard as it is often hard for him to eat out and obviously a worry for him. They were also accommodating of the kids in the group and offered them a different menu.   We had a three course menu (which was apparently about $35/person) with salad (I choose Cesar which was one of the best I've had with great flavourful bacon and obviously homemade yummy dressing and croutons), main (I had shrimp and scallop linguine. The sauce was a nice pesto/white sauce mix. there were only a couple of shrimp though and the scallops were the teeny, tiny baby ones. Ok but not great) and dessert (butter tart - really good flaky pastry and gooey filling, but seemed to minimal or simple, could have used ice cream or a chocolate garnish or something). My boyfriend had the same except the turkey club as main which was very simple and not that great. Very basic bread, nothing special, we could have been at Casey's or Kelsey's or any other number of basic chains.   The house red wine we had was good, but there was a confusion with the alcohol. There was supposed to be a limited number of bottles to share included and then a cash bar. However the servers made a mistake and told guest it was an open bar and were pouring the wine like it was water. This lead to a bit of awkwardness and discomfort for the bride and groom who had to go and talk with the staff and fix it.   Overall we had a great time, and it was a great venue to continue the beautiful day. the service was stellar but the food didn't overly impress. Also bonus points for cheap underground parking in the building. Only $2 when you got validated from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent Service and a nice fancy place to go to without breaking the bank !! I like their pasta the most. Others are so so."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for brunch.  I love their big patio, covered from the sun and - because it's covered - protected from smokers, too.  I don't like smelling other's people vices while I'm trying to enjoy mine - coffee and breakfast meat, fyi.  Service was a bit slow and scattered-brained - and one of the servers was wearing strong perfume, so every time she walked by I had to hold my breath - a pretty standard \"no-no\" in the restaurant business, maybe one of her co-workers or managers wants to inform of this generally adopted rule.    I ordered the O&B Breakfast, and when the plate came, I felt a little disappointed at the amount of food.  But my opinion quickly changed.  Everything on the plate was really delicious, well-seasoned and just really good.  Afterwards, I felt satisfied without feeling gross or overstuffed.  The price point was extremely reasonable and afterwards you can go for a walk on the boardwalk, just a few blocks away.    Will make a return visit, but only for weekend brunches - not usually a good spot when all the business people are milling around."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, Addy, our server was the best! It's one of our favorite italian restaurants in Toronto, I strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Positive: Great brunch place, it offers good food, service and nice ambience. Decent portions for the price  Negative: waitress needs training on \"Tab\" payment system."}
{"text":"I've actually been to many Oliver and Bonacini restaurants in the past, so when my friends suggested going to Bayview Village I was quite excited.  I'm not saying their restaurants are all 5/5, but most of the time they offer satisfactory dining experiences.  [Decor] I just want to comment on how pretty the restaurant looks.  The interior is spacious, filled with modern furniture, and a boasts a clean/open concept.  Very fitting for a restaurant in Bayview Village (also known as rich people's mall lols).  [Service] Our waitress gave us a lot of time to decide our menu choices.  My friend was quite busy tending to her baby and our waitress was cognizant of that fact.  Really liked the waitress up until the end, which was quite unfortunate.  It took her a century to get the bill taken care of.  She was quick to give us the bill, but where did she go afterwards?  It was like she became a bartender and was in her own little world making drinks.  We tried to flag her at least twice, and when I could't stand it any longer I started complaining out loud to my friends.  And as you all would expect, that's when she showed up behind me with the card machine.  What a coincidence.  Anyways, not sure what happened here, but wished we got to pay earlier.  [Food] I ordered the egg benedict.  THe taste was all there, but everything seemed a little dry.  The potatoes were really good, probably would have been better if they gave more and not like 5-6 cubes lols.  I also ordered a caesar as it only costs $5 on Saturday.  It definitely had alcohol, my face was aturning a nice pinkish red near the end of our meal.  The drink itself, although strong, was just okay in my opinion.  For its price, you can't really complain, but I've had way better in other restaurants.    In my own opinion, O&B is okay.  I wouldn't say that it was disappointing, but definitely not a crowd-pleaser.  I don't mind comimg back because the atmosphere is very soothing and comfortable.  I love how tables are widely spread so that I get a breather lols."}
{"text":"O & B always has a great atmosphere after work for some drinks. I have also taken many clients there for lunch, I'm a fan of the beet salad. A draw back is that I am vegetarian and don't see many options on the menu. Probably better I still to happy hour instead."}
{"text":"Corporate Douchiness at it's best.  Generally, I dislike big corporate chain restaurants. Oliver and Bonacini Cafe Grill is a limp excuse for a food destination. I will admit that their patio has a really nice layout that keeps the loungers near the back and the smokers under the heat lamps by the street. There's a very warm, living room-ish feel to it. Last night, one of the employees on the patio was nice enough to come over and replace the propane in the heater so that we were a little warmer.  This is where my compliments end.  I've been here twice. Once, about 2 years ago with some girlfriends and again last night with my boyfriend after the Anthony Bourdain show at the Sony Centre. When I opened the menu, I became really depressed. O&B Cafe and Grill is serving up a super boring menu with items that are designed to please people who have no idea what good food really is and the money to burn on crap cuisine.   My first time here they had a Tuna Salad on the menu (may still be on). It featured some Asian vegetables julienned with a sesame dressing and piece of Seared Tuna on top. It was okay, but nothing different from any other restaurant downtown. And at almost $30 is was a completely uninspired item.  Spring rolls platter: the small has 3 for almost $10. The large is almost $20 and has 6. Come on...spring rolls cost nothing!  My memory is almost photographic--especially for food items, but almost nothing on this menu caught my eye. The pizza toppings sounded bland and forgettable and I'm sorry, but Mac and Cheese is totally over-- you can add bacon, chives, truffle-- whatever you like, but it's not doing any customer any favours being on the menu-- except for the low food cost of pasta that helps the chain make money.  The on-line presence of this corporate livestock barn is almost non- existent at the moment. The link to their Restaurant and menus is dead-- which is one of the other reasons we actually went here. If I had seen the menu and the ridiculous prices on line, I never would have suggested it. It's my feeling that if you're a large corporate chain that you should have a working on-line presence. Fail.  I selected the Lily Pilly Sauvignon Blanc and the server said they were out. I then tried to order a Pinot Grigio-- as soon as the words came from my lips the server said there was none. I pointed to the wine list and she said that they were offering a different Sauvingon Blanc and I should try that. Fat chance at the price. I had the Camelot Chardonnay for $16 a glass. A big chain should have the purchasing power to maintain a fairly simple wine list. Fail.  We were thinking about ordering some of the overpriced spring rolls because we hadn't eaten since noon. Our server dropped off our drinks almost 10 minutes after we ordered and before we could place an order for food, she turned and walked off. Nice. That helped our decision to eat elsewhere. Just as we finished our drinks and were ready to leave, another server came over and asked if we wanted to order food. Yeah, maybe half an hour ago we did. Perfect timing because the crowd was becoming really douchey-- even for a Saturday night it was bad.  The service inside is a little more attentive, but on the patio-- good luck! Every time I've been out there it has been the worst service I've ever had. You literally feel invisible. On my first visit when no one visited our table for 20 minutes, I went to the bar. Suddenly, all the bartenders were nowhere to be found. I had to wait another 10 minutes there to get a vodka soda. So much for corporate efficiency.  On the way out I noticed several wine bottles adorning the wall (too bad your wine list is depleted) and an alcove adjacent to the front door that housed a dining mock up-- basically a lone table set up, never to be used. Window dressing in a restaurant? Tacky. I'm thinking if the design was well thought out-- that restaurant real estate would be used for something practical. Not an empty table. Fail.  O&B, you should have quit while you were ahead-- if you ever were. The whole chain has become nothing more than a mill for low food cost items at unfair prices, unimaginative menus and hit or miss service. I'll take my money to a place that has real people, food that hasn't come off a corporate truck and prices that are in keeping with the food quality."}
{"text":"I went there for the 2014 Winterlicious $15 lunch, the price for a three-course lunch was good compared to their usual price.  Service was okay, the restaurant was pretty full but we had a reservation so we didn't have to wait.  Appetizers- CHOPPED ROCKET & ROMAINE SALAD and BLACK BEAN, CHICORY & CABBAGE SLAW was average, and the Romaine Salad was a little too bitter to me, but I liked that there were raisins in it.   Mains- BEEF BULGOGI QUESADILLA was very nice and fulfilling. BLACKENED HADDOCK HOT POT...well the fish was good, but the vegetables in the dish had this raw feeling that I personally would rather avoid.  Desserts- WARM ONTARIO CRANBERRY DATE PUDDING and MAYAN SPICED CHOCOLATE PANNA COTTA were the best so far. The date pudding was soft and sweet, while the chocolate panna cotta was less sweet but just right for me."}
{"text":"It's like the waitress could read my mind. I was just thinking about how this meal would have been better with bread, and out comes bread. That was the highlight of my dinner.  We (two of us) arrived here on a Friday evening, excited to try their summerlicious menu. It's a conveniently located restaurant, located inside a mall with ample parking. The menu was appealing and the price was fair. Although their appetizers were only mediocre (we ordered polenta fries and a small side salad), my main/entree is what stuck out the most. I had a steak above a bed of mashed potatoes, with some carrots and crispy onions. The best part of the entire meal was the sauce that the steak was in. I have never had sauce that good. I used my bread to soak it up. The other main was a small medley of raw fish and vegetables (small and not very filling, average tasting). For dessert, I ordered an cannoli (average) and the other was a brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (delicious!).   If you do come here, please order that steak and the brownie with a scoop of icecream."}
{"text":"My uncle lives around this area and thought it would be nice to come for lunch here for something a little nicer.   We had a reservation and got seated quite quickly as the hostess was quick on her feet and friendly. The decor was very nice and modern, with different kinds of lighting throughout the restaurant. Always like seeing retro bulbs as it gives off a nice lighting.   I had the Chiorzo Sausage Hash, and my family got the Chicken Club and Stuffed Croissant. The hash was quite good with lots of flavour, but I felt the balance of the overall dish was a little off. There was too much potato, making the overall dish feel a bit dry.  The chicken club was massive and quite good. A little harder to eat and a messier lunch option, but not a bad choice.  The criossant was delicious, with lots of strong flavours. Loved it as it had some feta cheese!!  The service was what I didn't particular like about the restaurant. The wait for food seemed longer than it should be and our server didn't seem like she was all there. She got our orders wrong, missed out on a couple items, and even spilled some water on me. Granted, she said that she was accidentally 'bumped' into, but doesn't change the fact I was still wet. She also seemed a bit aggressive with placing glasses on our table after filling it with water, as well as taking forever to get us our bill and bring the machine over to pay. She was the only server I did a double-take for either. I definitely saw another server walk up to a table where a customer had dropped their scarf. Instead of picking it up for them, they just 'kindly' stepped around it and didn't inform them either.   Not exactly an establishment that I would like to go to again, even if the food was quite good."}
{"text":"This review is for brunch.  Let's begin with the most important stuff: mimosas & ceasars are $5 for brunch -- woohoo! The ceasar was surprisingly good and a decent size.  Okay, next up: the actual food. I ordered the leek & broccoli quiche, which came with a basic salad of arugula and salmon. It was billed as a salmon & arugula salad, and it had about 3 to 4 thin slices of salmon -- I'd say that's a small critique. I also had a side of dill flavoured dip. On the flip side, the quiche was a decent slice and the eggs inside were insanely fluffy and buttery.   My girlfriend ordered the OB breakfast, priced at $15. They accommodated her request for gluten free toast. She also got a glass of fresh orange juice ($4).   I decided to try the bruleed grapefruit ($6). It was served on a bed of mint and creme fraiche. I enjoyed the taste - it was an interesting mix of sweet and some sour. My girlfriend felt there was a bit of a bitter after taste, though.  I'd go back here. The location is clean and the service was attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Two of my best friends brought me here for my bday. It was one of my favorite meals! Need to come back and try their brunch selections."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely amazing! While our assigned waitress seemed to be particularly busy, another waiter often checked in on us, refilling our drinks and making sure we were enjoying our meals. It was a great team effort!  COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: This bread is SO FLUFFY and SO WARM! There's no other professional way I can put it. Do not feel guilty for ordering more! (If I'm being honest, this may be me trying to justify my decision to order more).  APPETIZER: Polenta Fries *Recommended*  Po-leaseeee get this! (That was supposed to be an attempt at a fun pun - a commendable effort at one perhaps). The polenta fries were crispy on the outside but soft and warm on the inside, and the portion size was quite large as well! The marinara sauce that accompanied the fries were delicious - just as all marinara sauces are!  MAIN COURSE: Cod and Crab Cake  For those that enjoy a bit of spice in your dish, this might be for you! The portion size of the crab cake itself was generous - with large pieces of shrimp, cod and crab. The fried batter coating the cake was thin (in a good way) and not oily (also in a good way - yes, there are times when oily food can be delicious; please refrain from judging too much).   Warning (I learned this the hard way): The streak of green sauce on the side of the plate is not some sort of blended vegetable - it is jalapeno sauce - the kind that burns your mouth when you eat a dollop of it.   Underneath the crab cake is a small pile of cabbage and grated vegetables. I found it to be quite dry (like a salad without dressing). However, the moisture from the crab cake helped in this respect."}
{"text":"I came here for a week day lunch with my work team. There were 8 of us who rocked up without a reservation, and they sat us down at 3 small tables which is the best they could do as the place was packed to the rafters. Luckily by the time our entire party had arrived, a larger table had opened up and we were moved across. What I particularly like about this patio is that a large part of it is covered, which is perfect for extremely hot days or inclement weather.  I ordered the crab cakes which was the daily special, but unfortunately they had run out (boooo hiss!!) so I ordered the Asian chicken salad, which was tasty - I finished every last bite - but mostly forgettable. I kept eyeing off my friend's mac and cheese which looked amazeballs. Everyone enjoyed their meal, our waitress kept us topped up with water and was generally on hand for anything we needed. We split the bill evenly and it wasn't too much trouble to pay with 8 different cards. Despite how busy the restaurant was, we were in an out within our hour lunch break. This place runs like a well oiled machine!"}
{"text":"I always like to come to O&B cafe and grill just because of the great atmosphere, consistent quality of food and great service.   Came here as part of winterlicious this year where it is still at a great price for dinner. Was seated at some corner table, wasn't too happy about that. They also offered us a seat outside on the nice and quiet AstroTurf, as if this was a better option.   Ordered the bayou bean and pea fritters (fancy falafel), it was good and hot. The blackened haddock: ingredients were fresh and had great flavour but my only complaint was that it wasn't blackened at all! Pumpkin & buttermilk cake was good but just the usual.   The only thing is that I don't recommend any mixed drinks here. The sangria I ordered had almost no alcohol content or fruits and tasted kind of like coolaid \"juice\".   I admit I wasn't too impressed this time, the quality and service varies from visits. However, our server was great, the atmosphere was good, it's always busy here and the prices you really can't complain about."}
{"text":"Came here at 8pm on a Sunday for drinks, and - maybe predictably - my group was the only one in the massive bar area.  The restaurant side was bumping and packed with people.  This is a very loung-y type of place.  Nicely decorated, simple music.  The massive patio and bar area would no double be a great place to pick up some Bay Street cuties on a Thursday evening!  My boozy Aztec Hot Chocolate was delicious and spicy.  Serving it with a piece of almond biscotti was a nice touch.  Everyone at my table enjoyed their cocktails and appz.  Service was a touch slow, but I chalk it up to the time of day.  I will definitely come back to try a full meal, and I'll upgrade my review then!"}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends on a Friday evening.  First, the good. The restaurant itself it gorgeous and certainly doesn't feel cramped or loud. The bathrooms were also nice.  The food... Meh! I have an issue with \"high end\" restaurants handing out plastic covered menus. Feels cheap and \"chainy\". I guess that was a sign of things to come as the food certainly looked and tasted that way too.  As an appetizer, I got the edamame which was fine. Certainly nothing to write home about.  I had the red drum fish which is served (like all their fish?) over ratatouille and its skin on. The portion was good but thin and way over-cooked. The ratatouille didn't pair with it well at all -- whats up with that? Meh.  My friends had the margherita pizza, some pasta dish and 2 others had burgers. The pizza looked awful, just a pile of cheese with no browning. Oh, and flavorless. Pasta and burgers were just average and overpriced.   Whats up with the waiter asking me what size wine glasses I want? I want a glass of wine -- not a beer. Cheapens the experience.  After dinner, we hit the outdoor bar which was the highlight for me. It was well lit, had some good looking people and just had a good vibe.  In summary, skip dinner and hit this place for an after-work or after-dinner (elsewhere?) drink."}
{"text":"Like eating in a tin can. The place is big and there is nothing architecturally to deaden the sound level. Food and service just average. Lot better places to eat in Oakville than this."}
{"text":"two stars for convenient location, food is mediocre at best. service was good! do not order the veggie lasagna - it is NOT worth 18$, it is the smallest portion ever and done in about 6 bites!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first O&B restaurant and had fairly high expectations. Celebrity chef, high end dining. Unfortunately my expectations weren't met.   Our waitress was definitely uninterested in our table, and despite the 6:30pm reservation felt like we were keeping her out way past shift change. She kept coming to get our order but failed to mention they were out of the daily special, and I had to ask about the soup special. However, her lack of interest could have been overlooked, but then catastrophe hit with the food.  Apps were good. Tables are provided with warm mini baguettes and butter. I had the vegan mushroom soup. It was very tasty. I did not miss the butter or cream at all. The calamari also was nice, freshly grilled. But then the mains came. The other diners at the table ordered Lamb Gnocchi, Seared Salmon, Mac and Cheese and all were satisfied, but not raving. I ordered the Lemon Chicken. I ate the filet first which had detached from the breast and seemed ok, but upon cutting into the breast it was completely raw. Not a little bit pink, raw. Like, gelatinous, translucent, just pulled out of the fridge raw. I showed the waitress who showed the manager. They made me another one.  To be fair, the manager handled the situation the best he could. He was appalled at the error. He apologized sincerely. He comped my meal and extra drinks and dessert for the table. But having to eat my (now dry overcooked chicken...because they weren't making the same mistake twice) dinner 20 mins after my table had finished ruined the dining experience.  Spent the next day worried if every noise my stomach made was the beginning of a salmonella poisoning battle.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Such yummy food! We had seafood linguine with pesto sauce and a prosciutto pizza. Food was spectacular, waiter was fantastic. We also had some drinks (sangria, basil black). We sat on the patio and it was a great atmosphere. I would highly recommend for lunchtime catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I love their food.  Recommendation: Pasta, pizza and their steak. DO NOT ORDER: chicken and salmon tataki ! (very small portion but pr icy).  Its actually a bit pricy for their food. However it is worthy it if you go to their daily special. Every Tuesday , $12 - all pasta or pizza. Every Sunday- $20 for steak. (Thats why i gave them 4-star)  Reminder: If you bring cake, they will charge you $1 per person for cake cutting fee.   Location is good, decor is good, and nice atmosphere, and the crowd is sophisticated."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch location in North York.  Rarely we can find brunch that consists of something other than eggs and sausages up here, but O&B makes it easy! I ordered their Fried Chicken French Toast which had \"Grand Marnier spiked caramel sauce & organic maple syrup\", which was as delicious as it sounds. It was topped off with mandarin slices that cut through the fat from the fried chicken. I think the price is fair for what we get, but this may not be the case for some other dishes. Great service.  I would come back just for the french toast!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a casual date or a meal with friends. A nice international menu- pani puri and mapo tofu.   I went to their winterlicious lunch special. The food was quite good but not mind-blowing. I loved their cocktails however, and the dessert... I only wanted more and more (I had the churros)."}
{"text":"After coming here for years this is a great disappointment.  While I tried several other things on the menu this night, I have to give one star because I had the worst pizza i've ever had in my entire life. That is a HUGE statement because I don't think  pizza is ever really THAT bad. I mean it's just bread and cheese, so really how can you go wrong?!  I tried the smoked salmon pizza with smoked ricotta, and Yukon Gold potatoes.  TASTELESS and dry pizza.  The smoked ricotta did not taste smoked at all, but the worst part was the potatoes. They literally just boiled potatoes and cut it in huge chunks and threw it on top of the pizza. ZERO salt, zero flavour and also still a bit hard on the inside.  If it wasn't for the smoked salmon the pizza would literally be tasteless.  The potatoes added NOTHING to the pizza and the ricotta couldn't save it. When you are making a pizza with no sauce, the other ingredients should really be seasoned somehow.  I was there with a group, so I guess I didn't think about returning the pizza because I was there more for the social aspect, but I totally regret not sending it back.    The quality at Oliver has gone down immensely each time I come here, do not waste your money for the overpriced food."}
{"text":"I was at O&B last night and I was appalled. Like literally APPALLED. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because I've been here before and it was ok and I've picked up take out from them a few times.   It is very rare that I complain to a manager or send food back. But this happened last night.  We ordered the chicken and leek potstickers and the black tiger shrimp appetizers. The potstickers were bland. They are missing something. The shrimp was ok but it was just deep fried and salty so how can that be bad?   We then ordered mac n cheese and the steak (striploin, I believe). I asked for medium well and it came out so unbelievably tough that you could hardly chew it. And it took a lot of sawing to cut through it. It was inedible. I have never had a steak cooked as tough as that. It was like eating an old shoe. The collards that came with it tasted alright (I had one bite) and I didn't get to try the polenta.... because to our horror, there was a giant HAIR IN THE MAC N CHEESE. And it wasn't mine or my friend's. It was baked into the dish. I didn't get to try the mac n cheese because of hairgate either but my friend did and she said it was bland. We were intending to share our entrees but after that, we just called our waiter and had it all sent back. He offered us new entrees but at this point, we had been there for almost 90 minutes. We have children. We were tired. We didn't want to wait another hour for food. So, we got dessert and coffee.   We're thinking the dessert will be great. WRONG. The gelato was freezer burned. Badly. It was the first thing my friend noticed when she took a bite of her carrot cake (comes with gelato) and made a face. My gelato was as well, both of the flavors (lemon and vanilla). My chocolate marquise cake was not that great either. You can get better desserts at any local bakery. To top it off, the coffees were bitter.  We ended up complaining and the manager took off the entrees off the bill but that was it. I really feel like he should have offered a few drinks for free or something considering EVERY SINGLE THING we ordered was total crap. Our bill was STILL $115. Unacceptable.   It was so bad that I honestly don't think I will ever eat here again. I don't even want to give it another chance. The standard has become so poor, so low, that I don't want to waste my money here and I'd be embarrassed to take someone here with that quality of food at what should, by the looks of the place, be a good eatery. When you can get better food at Jack Astors or Kelsey's, that's saying something about this place.   I ordered a Cobb Salad to take home (I was still hungry!!) and it was alright though I asked for no tomatoes and it was COVERED in tomatoes. The chicken was dry as well but the salad was fresh and the dressing was good."}
{"text":"OB is better than an average \"mall restaurant\", it's usually packed around lunch/brunch time and most nights. Whenever we have a large group and look for a \"safe\" choice restaurant to have something for everyone, this places pops up on top of the list.   Food is decent, nothing to write home about. I've learned to stay away from chicken dishes as I don't like dry and bland chicken breast. Desserts include a few solid performers: chocolate mousse cake with hazelnut crunch at the bottom, butter tarts, crème brûlée   Nice decor, like the open kitchen concept. Service can be chaotic or slow at times.   OB is conveniently located in Bayview Village, a nice mall to visit, especially the addition of Pusateri's will entice me to go even more often, so I will probably go back to OB."}
{"text":"I wasn't at all impressed. Average type of a meal. I had seafood dish and it was greasy. I could cook smth like that at home. My friend had butter chicken it was not bad."}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicius . Average food average service I don't think I have much to elaborate on as the meal was very average."}
{"text":"2.5-3*  The good: -The service is so so good here- never pretentious, always gracious and so friendly. -The food is actually quite good and the portions are perfect.  Just a little \"too much\" is what you should get when you go out to eat -The space is gourg.O  For real. The inside kind of looks like someone's large living room where you wouldn't mind taking your mom; but at the same time feel comfortable on a weekday/weekend date or friend group dinner -the patio can be pretty kickin but those big glass walls around the outside? a tad unnecessary methinks.  The bad: -It's owned by the O&B group.  The O&B group and I are NOT friends....: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/o-and-b-canteen-toronto#hrid:uStL7XoxPZKim2I8_lamAg -It's a little too pricey for what you get.  While everything is good, you know you are definitely paying for their real estate bill   This place is good but certainly not a top pick for the area/financial district.  You can get more value/ambience somewhere else.  But it ain't bad. (^NOT a winning endorsement)"}
{"text":"Service was very attentive and personal.  Food fresh and hot.  Noise  lively Friday night atmosphere felt good!"}
{"text":"Good food plus good service, average good but no surprise. Monday lunch special 3pcs of fried chicken and mashed potatoes with slow cooked gravy, and some green beans. Fried chicken tastes soooooooo good.  The only thing in the restaurant I don't like is the table and chair, look so old and shabby.....don't know why. I kept asking myself am I out? this is a new decorations style, is it?  Anyways I will go back to try their brunch at weekend"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious, 3 course meal. Was good. Nothing to rave about. More like yea ...i went to Oliver & Bonacini, they have a great looking kitchen and ambience. What about the food you ask? Nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I was there on Monday for an early dinner with wife. Place was pretty empty but picked up rather quickly with dinner crowd. The interior and seating is pretty nice. The darkness sets a tone.  The service was great. I found the waiter to be very nice and genuine and was quite engaging.  The food was just alright. I had the fish and chips and my wife the crab cakes we also got a thin crust pizza as app to share. About half way through the duah i git tired of my meal it was just bland and boring. Althouvh the fires weree solid. I did like the crab cake i feel the crab cake is pretty ssolid. For dessert we had alava cake and a creme brule. My favourite dish was the creme brule it was delicious. My wife did not like the raspberry lava cake she felt the exterior was weird. Overall I feel the price does not make up for the lack of taste on much of the food as it's pretty average and there are much better restaurants where you can get much more flavorful food for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks with my friend and we were utterly disappointed at their service.   I couldn't even stay for a drink, we had to leave. Never coming back here neither will I recommend this place to anyone   I'm getting upset again, just thinking about it. Kmt.   However, the ambience is lovely."}
{"text":"The portion of food is very small, we went here twice once in winterlicious event ,once in regular time and I still felt hungry after eating my whole meal there. Our server was in rush and tried to take our plate away before we finished.   We ordered salmon, ravioli and crab cake. The food were delicious and the place was very nice with plenty parking spot in Bayview village but I expected more form Oliver and Bonacini Cafe."}
{"text":"It's fine.  There was a time when O&B was a gold standard in Toronto, but what the heck do they care anymore.  It's an institution that counts on corporate cards whose holders have few scruples about wasting money on an average meal."}
{"text":"O&B is a great improvement over the East Side Mario's that used to be in Oakville Place.  Been here a couple of times.  The decor is clean and stylish, spacious seating, service is good, and the food is consistently good.  Had the mushroom soup which was tasty for a non cream based soup.  The tempura shrimp with wasabi aioli was light and crispy pockets of shrimpy goodness.  I could pop a lot more of those into my mouth!   The grilled calamari a la Canoe fame  was cooked perfectly & came with nice veggie and rice sides.  Only downside was that I don't remember the anchovies that are part of the accompaniment coming in such big pieces  the last time I had it.  This made for some really fishy salty bites and others that were bland in comparison.  Fish and chips was really light and crispy.  Tried the chocolate mousse cake dessert with drunken cherries.  Yes it's as good as it sounds!   Downside - there appeared to be a bunch of regulars around us and the service they got was less cool than the reception we got.  Would have been nice to have a warmer reception and more attentive with the small things eg had to ask for fresh ground pepper instead of being offered same.  There's always room for improvement...."}
{"text":"First thing makes us first great impression is O & B customer service, they tried their best to accommodate our requests.  We didn't make reservation and it is a full house booking on Thursday evening. We were seated outside the patio area (inside the mall, outside the restaurant) the heater is on which is comforting during the whole dining experience.   A staff named Megan, I have to say she is a great greeter in the front and well managed our concerns and requests to the seating.  I am glad to have a good start of the dinner. :) sometimes you walk in to a place they don't really seem care in service because they think they are big branded and it is not a matter if losing a customer. U know what I mean. So yes this is a great quality they have.  Our server brought us two round of breads. They taste fresh and warm too. Pretty good they care to warm them up before putting on to diner table.  We ordered a Thursday Special and Seared Salmon and a cup of mushroom soup. Our server is very responsible and she asked us if we have any food allergy.  This is a very good practise in her role.  I think they did a great job in training their staffs and if they could maintain this that I would have to return and share here again.  Lets talk about food.  The special Thursday is breaded chicken with herbs and salads. It is very juices and average size for lady, not enough for a hungry person. I guess its special priced and the size is proportional with its price.   The seared salmon is ok. Not as juice as I was expecting.  Pan fried is not the best to cook the fish, I just find it a little bit dry.  I enjoyed the mushroom soup a lot as it has a very strong flavour of mushrooms and only problem is the savoury is too strong for me.  :)  but I recommend it as it is the best mushroom flavoring soup surely they use alots of mushroom by looking the soup color assuming there isn't any artificial mushroom drops used. ;)  At the end, dessert is a must and make a perfect dinner complete. We ordered what the server recommended us .... The daily made fresh cheese cake. That's wonderfully made, warm and fresh. I have to say this is the best cheesecake I have tasted so far.    The phyto layer outside is a tasteful flavor to prepare the taste bud before a bit of this sharable cheesecake , fabulous match with my cup of coffee.    I really enjoy my dinner tonight and one score less is banked to my next visit. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend on the weekend. I had the Mac and Cheese and she had the Breakfast Burrito. Both dishes were fabulous. Breakfast Burrito was tasty and the Mac and Cheese was delicious. They were both perfect portions. We had reservations and the table was ready when we got there. Service was great. Food came in a timely manner. The decor was nice. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the first time was a few years ago and I dont even remember what I got. All I know that it was meh and I wouldn't care too much to come back.  The only reason I came back was because it was a friends birthday. This time I ordered the Beet Root salad and was disappointed again. The serving was extremely small  and the food quality was below average.  I won't be eating here again as it's pricey. There are much better restraints in the same range. If a friend tries to host it at this venue, I'll make sure to make them change their mind :)"}
{"text":"Why do I get the feeling that they are more focused on the decor than the food?  I had brunch here and I was left wanting for more.  Admittedly the space is gorgeous, especially the cunning industrial light fixtures over the bar and the wonderful old map of Toronto that act as backsplash behind the bar.  The wait staff were friendly and accomodating.  But the food felt misplaced.  I had the O&B breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and cheese scone.  Sounds wonderful but the taste just fell flat.  Either not enough fat or enough love on the plate.  I just felt a little saddened because it did not make me feel full and hearty afterwards, just a little bloated.  My boyfriend had the steak and eggs.  He said the steak was great because it was the \"dinner\" steak and not the tough meat they usually serve.  But overall he felt that it was ho-hum as well.  It will be very hard to go back here for anything else but maybe another try on their beautiful patio.  Maybe..."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious.   SERVICE - Awful. I didn't understand all the fancy words on the menu and when I asked for clarification she was very impatient. If making you feel welcome was part of her job she definitely failed. The waitress was distracted at every interaction, she would just look far off into the distance. The food came a bit slow (maybe because they just opened) and when I asked to check on the progress she was rude and unapologetic.   APPETIZERS - The Seafood Chowder was delicious, felt like it was home made. The Tuscan Kale & Gem Lettuce Salad was disappointing, the dressing tasted like ranch.   MAIN - the Poached True North Salmon was okay. The poached egg was too well done and the salmon was plain with a little lemon juice on top. The Minced Lamb Shepherd's pie was great! The meat was very savory, small portion but filling.   DESSERT - the Warm Chocolate Tort was too sweet in my opinion, I think there was some raspberry sauce but I could not taste it because the chocolate's sweetness was overpowering. The Banana Tarte Tatin was a glazed cake. It was simple but delicious. Not too sweet but plenty of flavour."}
{"text":"Review on the Run:  This place has been hit and miss. However our lunches were quite good during the summerlicious event.  I had a wonderful Tortillia Soup which was nicely flavoured. It was in a Cilantro broth that had a nice kick.   I had the chicken for the main, and normally never order chicken from a restuarant because thats what I cook at home most often, but I was glad I did. Very moist and juicy.  Finished with the Warm Strawberry and Rhubarb Buckly with toasted Almond ice cream. Extraordinarily yummie.  Conclusion: Eat Here? Sure."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night around 8PM with a group of 10 without a reservation. We waited about 30 minutes to get seated but that was fine, understanding it was a busy Friday night (we just walked around the mall to kill time). Once we got into the restaurant and got seated, we received great service. Our server was very friendly, accommodating and lively. After we placed our orders, orders came quickly, which is something I commend O&B for, especially since all of us were really hungry. Everything I tried from my appetizer to main entree to dessert was delicious. I ordered the beef short ribs as my main entree and that was a course highlight. I definitely recommend the beef ribs (tender and flavourful)! I was very satisfied with everything I ordered. Would come again, for a LiciousTO event, or on a regular occasion. Recommend it!"}
{"text":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.   I wanted to like this place, but everything sucks here. The service is slow, and the servers are sometimes rude, probably exhausted from all the complaining they get from the crap food.   I forgave them the first time and ended up going back 2 or 3 more times, thinking they couldn't be this bad normally. But each time I went back it was the same. Poor service and some of the most boring/bland dishes I have ever eaten(I've tried more than half the menu).   Never going back."}
{"text":"I'm really glad that we tried the Leek Tart as an appetizer!  It was really good!  It was not assembled like a traditional 'tart'.  There were two pieces of puff pastry that sandwiched brie and cream and what tasted to be onions and cabbage.  There wasn't a lot of leek at all for this tart (unless our taste buds were mistakened).  The only leek we saw were the ones sprinkled on top of the tart and around the plate.  Either way, I really liked this leek tart especially near the end when I got a big chunk of brie cheese in my mouth.  Yum!  Brie cheese is love.  My Atlantic Salmon main dish came with green lentils, roasted winter squash, and lemon & white wine butter sauce.  The narrow piece of salmon sat on top of a gigantic pile of mostly green lentils and squash pieces.  I didn't realize that there were going to be so many lentils.  Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with this dish.  The piece of salmon was quite firm and dry.  There needed to be some more sauce to the dish.  The combination of green lentils and squash in the butter sauce did taste quite good at the beginning.  Once the dish started to get cold though, the sauce was barely detectable and the overall dish was just so-so.  More sauce and juicy salmon, please!  The Lobster Mac & Cheese had Atlantic lobster, cheddar, sweet peas, cheese curds, and Goldfish crumb in it.  When it arrived, it was a huge plate of pure lobster mac and cheese!  I really liked the creaminess and cheesiness of the dish.  The chunks of lobster that were present were quite good and meaty.  However, we both thought that there wasn't enough of it in the dish.  Despite the subtle disappointments in the food, we still had a great time dining in.  The drinks, service, and atmosphere were really great."}
{"text":"This place has a great environment, amazing staff and great food. The Saturday night special is a spicy set of ribs."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in my experience yesterday with my family at the restaurant. This location used to be my favourite when I grew up in this area, and over the years I have seen a general decline in quality of food and service, but not this bad.   Let's start with the Good: The menu has changed a lot since it's peak days. But still the best remains the strawberry lemonade drink ($6 - quite pricey for a non alcoholic bevie) and the mushroom soup. Their desserts are fairly priced with good portions and were tasty ($8) Overall, this brunch menu seems to have shrunk, and nothing here really caught my eye (or anyone in our group) You can feel this when no one really can figure out what to order and takes a long time, not because there is so much on the menu, because they are trying to choose between mediocrity.   The Bad: My cousin ordered the Mac and Cheese DO NOT GET THIS. We thought, looks yummy, how badly can they screw it up?? The menu states \"Gouda, rocket, and Goldfish Crumbs\".  From the caliber of O&B restaurants we really expected more, at least a gourmet cheesy pasta, worthy of the $16 price point. Instead, it was tasteless. It was dry. There was hardly any taste of cheese. It was so bland that it wasn't worth eating.  In addition, the \"Rocket\" was not a plastic toy hidden in the pasta, but actually it's green herb/leafy real vegetable. However, not really evident in the food, and probably was the several wilted green things embedded in the macaroni.  Also, I was surprised at the mention of an ingredient of Goldfish crumbs and would think the O&B at Bayview Village would be beyond that. Even toasted bread crumbs would have been more classy, instead of trying to be original. Fail on so many levels.   My brother in law ordered the Wilted Tomato dish. Hardly a dish (see pics), as it's grape tomatoes that were slightly green, chopped in half with a huge dollop of tasteless mozzerella cheese on top.  I did not know \"Wilted Tomatos\" was a thing. Maybe I'm just ignorant of innovative foods, but doesn't it mean that the tomatoes have gone bad? they were all slightly green inside. Nonetheless, the presentation of the entire thing was not appetizing at all.  Again for the $14 price point, it lacked any sort of quality or originality that I would expect from O&B. Not worth it at all.   Another cousin ordered the beef burger which he enjoyed, but the fries were not so great. It seemed like it was not fresh, and cooked from frozen. Maybe I'm wrong, but it wasn't appetizing at all. It lacked a crispness and airiness, and was almost solid and dense and soggy.   I ordered the Poached Eggs. Came on a crispy puffy pastry under aspargus and mushroom sauce with a cheap helping of truffled hollendaise. It was quite good, but the unseasoned asparagus that were slightly undercooked could have been improved. Also only one puff pastry, seems like it was missing a 2nd one, but not a deal breaker.  My mother in law ordered an omelette. The presentation was also again unappetizing. They served the salad on the side as if the plate was served without a missing component. The omelette itself looked like hospital food, although she did enjoy it. Too bad I didn't get a picture of it before she quickly took someones salad and put it on her plate - seems like she wasn't impressed either.   Our service was long. We were a large table, but this seems typical of my last few visits here over the years. It was Fathers Day but at 3pm.   Our waitress was very friendly, helpful by separating bills, and amicable when dealing with food allergies and questions from our family.  However, we did not get any bread at the table until our meal was served (not to mention long wait time beforehand) and the meals were not all served at the same time. There remained about 3 plates (including the omelette which came last) which was a good 5-10 mins after everyone. I don't think this is acceptable.   During our meal, lots of instagram photos were posted tagging the company, to which they responded the next day asking me to post my experience to their comment page. Kudos for following up, but let's see what comes of it.  Update: so after I posted my comment, the manager of the restaurant called me to tell me that she will be looking into it. My description was detailed and lengthy as this review so there wasn't really much else to say. She did appreciate the feedback (and now I feel bad that I've been harsh) and is sending me a token of appreciation.  Good customer service. And I guess they have a reputation to uphold. Personally their reputation is overpriced food, however, USUALLY the quality is very good (except this time).  Because of this experience, I told myself that when I really like a restaurant, I should send a comment to praise them. Too much negativity can't be good for people."}
{"text":"Their Japanese Chicken Caesar salad is to die for! I eat salad all the time but, theirs($18) is the best! Not so much of the grill chicken ( just too plain), but the salad is so tasteful!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Had the OB Mushroom Soup (which is somehow made without Butter or cream. It was great given that it didn't have any of those two ingredients ... definitely didn't seem any different. Great presentation. This is a great place to come to after work on weekdays. Mature crowd and great customer service. Our server was Spencer who was engaging and great to chat with!"}
{"text":"Quite the disappointment. Had high expectations for a restaurant owned by Oliver & Bonacini. Service was slow, the kitchen was slow, and the food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"So flew into Oakville for the Christmas to visit my mother for a few weeks. Decided to take her out for dinner at Oliver & Bonacini'. The restaurant seemed nice with nice decor and friendly server.   After we were seated it literally took the server 15 minutes to even acknowledge we were seated. After that we were given water and told they would be back to take our drinks. Another 10 minutes go by (mind you it was not very busy this night) and our server finally comes to take our order. Again we waited a while for our drinks and once we got our drinks the food was finally taken. I ordered the butter chicken while my mother ordered the steak fritz. Here is where I got mad.  Upon recieving the butter chicken it tasted cold and to be honest was not that authentic tasting. The naan bread was undercooked and very doughy tasting. What was worse was the steak fritz. The cut of steak was small and dried up. My mother specifically asked for medium rare and she recieved it well-done. That was a huge indicater that this restaurant did not know how to make steak, or an authentic tasting butter chicken. I was asked if we wanted desert I quickly asked for the bill and left.   I would not recommend this place. Service was terrible. Food was terrible. And over priced for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I went there this evening with my boyfriend and we had ordered the crabcakes as appetizers to start. I find the crabcakes extremely dry and burnt all around and extremely salty. The slaw as a compliment to the East Coast crab cakes was extremely sour. For our main entrées; I had the Roasted Atlantic salmon with was just okay! Nothing fantastic about the salmon but did find it a bit bland, I find it extremely strange how it was smothered in butter and edamame peas and diced lettuce as if its soup like and greasy. My boyfriend had the Ontario AAA tenderloin steak frites, the steak was not flavoured but the herbed fries was very tasty but not $40.00's worth. I gave it a last chance with the dessert; The coconut cream pie. The coconut cream part was decent but the crust was not flaky and super soft. Overall, we did not enjoy it. Did nit bother talking to the manager because we did not want to make a fit. Just wanted to share so incase anyone orders these items in thw future you know what you are get'n. Totally not worth it. Been to other O&B restaurants and this is definitely the worst one. Sadly, we spent over $100 on items we did not enjoy."}
{"text":"Two of my managers treated me out to lunch at O&B Cafe Grill today.    The reason why it only gets 3 stars, is because it is incredibly loud.  If you want to sit down and be able to have a conversation without having to enunciate and scream, then this is not the place to go.  It felt more like a Bar/Lounge on a Friday night as opposed to a lunch on a weekday afternoon.  The reason why this restaurant is so sound-reflective is probably because of all the hardwood furnishings, and a tall, open ceiling.   I ordered the Portobello Burger which came with your choice of sides (Salad, Soup or Fries).  I opted for the Onion Soup.  I like my soup piping hot, and when my order came, the soup was just slightly warm.  The cheese was a little bit too stringy and I found myself having to use my napkin many times to prevent the awkward spider-web-cheese-hanging-from-your-lip situation from occurring.  The burger was flavourful, served with tomato, lettuce, sun-dried tomato goat's cheese and pesto oil, but again, it was barely warm.  We also ordered a plate of fries for the table.  I found that they were not crispy enough, and the spiced aioli was nothing special.  Just felt like mayo mixed with Tobasco sauce.    To finish I ordered a cappuccino and with everything else that came to the table today, again not hot enough.  I also found their cappuccino to be a bit on the weak side.   At the end of the day, I learned that I have two very generous managers - however, I would probably not come back here again... Considering the wide array of restaurants in the area, this would not be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"So walked in with a date. Let's just say this place knows its clientele. After work crowd, check. Girls night, check. Business meeting, check. Want to impress your date, a definite check. Oh and a family dinner, by all means, check. No reservations yet we were seated right away in the lounge. The ambiance was nice. The noise level buzzed around you and yet it's like you're in a cosy bubble. The server came by frequently. This place definitely knows how to set the mood for a good time haha. We shared the grilled calamari, and for someone who prefers her calamari fried to grilled, I'd have to say this was one of the best grilled dishes I've had yet. He had the baby spinach salad (dates that eat salad are red flags people) and I had the mushroom soup (no cream or butter.. Nice, but mushrooms need cream and butter haha). But the best part, the absolute best part for me, they serve a moscato! Jacob's Creek, and Australian label, very inexpensive, although it's $10 a glass here. This is a fancy place, so why not charge practically the price of a bottle per glass? I digress. I'm very happy to find a fancy smancy place that serves moscato, as none of the other places I frequent do. And this little lady loves her moscato, thank you very much. Takeaway: pricey, but if you're going for the atmosphere, then it's worth the price. Especially if you're trying to impress someone, date or otherwise. And if you're going for the moscato.. Just pick up the bottle at LCBO like any other poor working girl!!"}
{"text":"I must say that this was the first time trying this restaurant and I was pretty disappointed after hearing good comments.   SERVICE: mediocre to terrible, for higher priced restaurant, you'd expect above average service but the first thing that I noticed was too many servers on a less than busy night, most of them were just standing around. Our server in particular seemed attentive at first but then disappeared after when we tried to order our food and pay the bill.  FOOD: I ordered the Albacore Tuna Soba Noodle salad which was recommended by our server but after eating a few bites, I almost felt sick after. The tuna didnt seem to be fresh and not seared properly giving me an upset stomach the morning after. The noodles were overcooked and too creamy for my likely. All in all the dish lacked flavour and was overpriced at $25. My friend ordered pot stickers as an appetizer and which appeared to be overboiled not like how a real \"dumpling\" should taste. Another friend ordered some chicken flatbread pizza which was even more unappetizing as the chicken pieces itself were small, overcooked and lacked flavour.   AMBIENCE: I'll give two stars here because I liked the roofed patio, the spaciousness of the restaurant and the decor.  All in all, I was pretty disappointed and don't think i'll return again."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot and comfort food.  Try the scotch eggs they are really good.  Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch one day. It's such a classy and cute place. The service was great and the food was even better! The creme brulee was perfect. I will definitely be coming back here"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at O&B. When I made a reservation I asked if we could get a more quiet or private table as we were going to celebrate our anniversary. They not only sat us at a lovely private booth, but both the host and wait staff greeted us and wished us happy anniversary without us even saying anything. Everyone was so friendly. The food and ambience was great and romantic. We ordered the Saturday BBQ ribs special which was so flavourful and the Octopus entree was filling and comforting for a cold winter day. The ribs were fall off the bone and had a nice kick to it. Lots of spices and flavours. They surprised us by giving my husband a complimentary cocktail since I am pregnant and when we ordered the yummy white chocolate cheesecake they wrote happy anniversary for us. Our waitress even offered to take a picture of us without me having to ask. I love the way O&B took the time to make our dinner a memorable one and paid attention to details."}
{"text":"Love the menu  Mushroom soup is awesome Pasta is great too Brunch is always delightful"}
{"text":"They have $5 mimosas which are awesome. For the main  i ordered the eggs Benedict with salmon. It tasted amazing. Some of the best i have had. For desert i had the white chocolate cheesecake. Very filling and tasted great."}
{"text":"I've worked at Oliver & bonocinis. I know what is expected of a visit to any of the O&B restaurants. Honestly .. if this place keeps up with the terrible service that I experienced tonight, in such a prime location, Oliver and bonocinis will eventually lose their good reputation. My friends and I waited for over ten minutes - no menus. No water. No server. No SERVICE. and it's really not that busy. The server in the section looked absolutely miserable and didn't acknowledge us once until after the manager came over (35 mins after already sitting there and ordering drinks off a bus boy - who forgot and I ended up just ordering from the bar) The manager then forgot our second round of drinks - remembering once we waved him down.  The food ... not up to O&B standard .. calamari tasted like frozen calamari .. the tacos were (in lack of better terms) slop. And the wings and crab cakes .. they were \"alright\".  This review is slightly harsh however I expected much more from this restaurant and was slightly embarrassed as I told my friends from out of town how great it was."}
{"text":"Business Lunch. Work colleagues went for a work achievement lunch. The food was very good. Fantastic choices for a vegetarian like me. Service was great. Upscale and felt casual as well. Nice presentation on the plate and equally good tasting and flavourful  Updated for 2016-08-24 Upon sitting the server asked do want flat or sparkling water (18 of us, BTW). All those sitting in the middle of a long table asked for plain water and no ice. We ordered our food and paid for our own separately and Li and behold were charged $3 each for water that was specially filtered (Q water). The charge surprised all of us and spoke to the server. She put a defence that you folks asked for it. But we asked for plain water and weren't aware that there was a charge. All charges were reversed.   On food now: Ordered an Avocado Toast with fries instead of salad. The toast plain and there was a layer of hummus and then the avocado and topped with fried onions. The avocado had some lime, but no seasonings. The fries were a bit overdone for my taste, but this my third experience and I guess this is how O&B does it."}
{"text":"I was super excited to come here for dinner from all the good things I heard about this place. However, It didn't live up to the reviews and comments I've heard.  The people were all very friendly though which is why they got two stars. The decor is nice as well. But the food, left much to be desired.  I ordered the starter caesar salad and it was just awful. It tasted less like a caesar salad and more of a citrus orange dressing salad. I seemed to have the end of the lettuce stock only and there was no caesar dressing taste at all. I sent it back because I couldn't even eat around the dressing. For my main I ordered the sunday special. I believe it was the prime rib dinner. It was dry and bland. I was so disappointed because it sounded like quite the dinner on the menu.   Maybe I just came on the one off day but it left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Everything was just OK eating here.  Food was fresh and hot but I was expecting a meal with a bit of a wow factor.  Service was very long...very slow.  Food was just average. Expecting more considering the price."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks with friends I havent seen in a while so I was looking forward to it.  Got seated on the patio which is pretty nice, not the best I've seen in Toronto but not bad.  Decent size.  Ordered a mojito which was very watered down.  Ordered a salad which was nothing to it, definitely expected more. When I asked the waitress for more dressing (because it was so bland I needed more flavor) she brought me cesaer dressing and before I realized it was not the same dressing as the one I had, I poured it on my salad.  Gross salad had to go back, new one took so long to come that my friends were already done eating their food and I ended up eating my salad alone.  We sat and chatted for no more than 45 mins and in that time the waitress came by AT LEAST 4 times to ask us if we wanted anything else, did we want our bill?  I would completely understand if the restaurant was FULL and as we were not ordering anything else and just chatting at this point but half the patio was empty.  All the tables directly around us were vacant.  I would not go back here.  Overpriced for stuff I would expect at a restaurant with a much lesser reputation to uphold, and the staff have no manners.  WAAAAAY OVERATED."}
{"text":"Not the first time at this location, but the service keeps declining. Waited for eggs Benny and an order of regular fried eggs for almost an hour. We did get a brief apology, a tea cookie on the house (really?) and a charge for an extra water!!! I might be wrong, but their food is not that good to be worth an hour wait. And they could have been more attentive, since no welcome appetizers are offered, and at least taken the water off the bill ($6.00). That was not the case, so next time I and my friends will choose a further but more decent place."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Amanda, was extremely professional. She acknowledged the special occasion of our dinner (meeting for the first time in over 30 years), and was patient in our ordering of our meal, recognizing that we had lots of catching up to do. We were given Prosecco as well as the post meal coffees in honour of the special occasion. The food was excellent. All in all, the experience was superb... service, food and ambiance were 5 star. Thank you, Amanda and O&B."}
{"text":"The service here is great  Not so crazy about the food as there is not much variety. Some dishes are a hit and miss"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for years and for some reason never had the opportunity until today. Leah and I had to meet for work so why not try meeting for lunch.  I was typically me and early and arrived just as the opened the doors. When I walked in the smell was amazing - like walking into Mom's kitchen at Sunday night dinner - amazing smell of roast beef and just incredible !  Within a 39 minutes the place started getting really busy and was a bustle of activity !    The restaurant service was impeccable & the meal was delish !!"}
{"text":"This place should not have the O&B name associated with it. I ordered a pizza and pasta for myself and my friend. As soon as the pizza came out it looked wrong, thick cheese in the middle, greasy, like something from Pizza PIzza. The pasta was nothing special either.  At the end of the meal when the waiter asked how everything was, I told him the truth. All he did was apologize for us not being satisfied. It would have been nice if he had sent a manager to get some more info in order to do better next time, but no, nothing.  I did send an email to their head office and received a missed call from the manager, but that was it. I expect more when I'm paying that kind of money for pizza and pasta."}
{"text":"I've been to this place quite times now. It's not because I loved the food here but only because it was located right beside my house. Located inside Bayview Village, the restaurant itself is big but I'm not sure if the quality of the food is worth its size. Also, I think with this price range, you could go to better Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I guess I've been lucky so far. None of the Summerlicious/Winterlicious restaurants I've been to have really left me feeling like I've missed out on reasonable portions by paying a little less.  Well, thank you O&B, for taking that away from me. Their braised short rib entree was smaller than my hand, and I have tiny hands!   First of all, I did enjoy the food on the most part. If I were to do it all over again (I won't, but if I were to), I would've chosen the Warm Wild Mushrooms Focaccia (delicious warm mushrooms on toasty bread), Skin Roasted Sea Bream (tasty fish resting on some aromatic broth), and Fudge Brownie (a little crispy on the outside and moist on the inside). Unfortunately, I had chosen none of these items, and could only sample from my group's plates. Instead I got:   Ontario Tomato & Peach Salad - hey I wanted something healthy and fresh tasting and wouldn't \"fill me up too much\", and I got exactly that. This is literally tomatoes and peaches.   Simmered Beef Short Rib - other than the initial shock of how small this was, the meat was actually quite delicious. It rested on a bed of soft mashed potatoes and peas that could've used more flavour, but was great to soak up the beef sauce.   Popcorn Ice Cream - did you think it's gonna be something cool and unique, like I did? It was literally just as it's advertised: store-bought caramel popcorn on top of half-melted vanilla ice cream. It was way too sweet and I only finished because I was still hungry.   Honestly, this cafe was beautiful. I thought it had a classy old-school vibe that was vibrant because it was always bustling. Service was also really good, as our waitress was extremely friendly (though the entrees did take 30 mins, but I'm not gonna count that against them). But that price with those portions for food that is ok but not amazing? Nah. Even though the $28 dinner price point isn't the highest tier on the Summerlicious menu, I thought I'd pay to at least get full.  (74/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be in Toronto during this years summerlicious festival and all four members of our group opted for the summerlicious menu at O&B this time around. It was really delicious! While our meal was off to a bit of a slow start (it took quite a while for our waitress to greet us once we had been seated).   I started with a tomato, goat feta, basil, and balsamic salad, follow by beef short rib with amazing mashed potatoes and veggies, and finished it off with the brownie option for dessert. The food was all really delicious, but my favorite aspect of the whole meal was how the restaurant accommodated my request; I can't have ice cream but opted for the brownie with ice-cream option, without ice cream - The restaurant give me a bigger brownie and more chocolate sauce to make up for the missing ice cream! It seems like a small and simple gesture, but it's those kind of things that make a big impact on my overall dining experience. Well done O&B!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a year to try this place and finally got in last week and was not disappointed! If anything it exceeded my expectations!  The ambiance is between business and business casual. I just loved the decor! Loved the upside down sand pails as lighting fixtures!   Now let's get to the food! My boss ordered pot stickers, vegetable rolls and sweet potatoe fries and all of them were so good! Sweet potatoe fries were not salty like other places serve them so they even more addictive!  I ordered the mushroom soup and I loved how they advertised that it was NOT made with any cream or butter just pure mushrooms and it was divine! After that came the portobello mushroom sandwich - wow! It was layered from bottom to top with goat cheese, pickled eggplant, roasted red peppers, tomatoe and red onion and let me tell you what that did to my taste buds!!!! With a side order of house salad and I didn't even have to ask for more dressing because it was perfect.    Our waiter was very attentive and very sweet.   Yes a little pricey but I believe we are all entitled to a nice meal once in a while and if u do feel that way then I strongly suggest O&B!"}
{"text":"I came here twice for business meals.  The first was a lunch and it was great.  I enjoyed the Japanese Caesar salad, which was absolutely unique.  It had chicken, which was beautifully seasoned with edamame and ginger.  It was also a big portion.  The server was bubbly and full of life.  The second visit was a team dinner in the private room.  It was very classy and fun.  We sat around a big table and the food was really good.  I had the heirloom tomato to start and the salmon as my entrée.  It was all great."}
{"text":"We went for Winterlicious where you would expect them to put their best foot forward.   The appetizer salad tasted like KFC cole slaw sprinkled with a bit of quinoa to make it fancy.  For the entree, we had what was basically a slab of ham, some bland grits, a small serving of veggie and a tiny dollop of honey mustard for flavour.  The lime pudding dessert was quite flavourful though.   I have been to the O&B downtown and that one was amazing.  Very attentive service, creative food, posher surroundings but same price points."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant located walking distance from the CN Tower.   I had the Linguine with shrimp. Since I don't like pesto sauce, they were able to substitute it with marinara sauce and it tasted great.  The restaurant is a little expensive, but I did enjoy the food and vibe, so I didn't mind the price. And I also recommend seating outside if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious and booked a reservation...thank god! It was super busy as was the last day of summerlicious. Wasn't a huge fan of the appetizer all they were offering was salad as their wasn't much dressing to it, on the other hand the veal sandwich was delicious not breaded decent amount of sauce and good presentation as well as warmth, as for the desert I got the lava cake and wasn't overly impressed it was very sweet with the cherry accent but was good enough for a 15 dollar meal. The staff here is very friendly and quick overall experience was good and would recommend a try, will be coming back to try regular course!"}
{"text":"When you have to wait over 30 minutes for a calamari appetizer during summerlicious then that is not acceptable. I'm leaving"}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for dinner on a Wednesday night. Making reservations was simple as I was able to do it online. We were seated in the patio area where the floor is coveted by AstroTurf - very cool concept. You feel as if you're outside. I had the mushroom soup to start. It's a little salty, but I liked the soup. Apparently it's made without butter or milk so it's healthier than other mushroom soups. Order the cup size as it's quite a generous portion. As my main, I ordered the baked oysters (from appetizer section of menu.) Each order comes with three oysters. They were okay; the cheese overpowered the oysters. The food here is a-okay. O&B isn't cheap, but serves okay food. The decor is nice so you're definitely paying for the aesthetics.   Good for: groups, celebrations"}
{"text":"Attempt #2 to dine at O&B was a success.   In the warmer months, you will need a reservation.  I'm definitely a fan ... for reasons besides the food. My meal at O&B was mediocre; I'm no Emeril Lagasse, but I think I could make most items on the menu.  The location is a huge plus ! At the busy corner of Yonge and Front, it's crowded and a paradise for those who love to people-watch. Both the interior and exterior decor look great.  Service was fab. Our server was attentive and entertaining.  Don't be shocked if the food doesn't blow you away; however, the service and general ambiance is great. For Patio Lovers, definitely check out O&B at Front and Yonge."}
{"text":"Overpriced, sub-par quality, and weak service. We came here after work for drinks on the patio which we were told was \"first come first served\". We found a table that had no drinks or food on it but just a guy's wallet (not a smart move). Apparently he was \"holding\" it while he had his cigarette and waited for his friend to arrive. Not cool. After waiting around for a while, another table opened up. Our server was grouchy and didn't show up for at least 10 minutes after which she brought one water for one person and disappeared again for another 10 minutes. When we finally got our drinks ($18 for a 9oz glass of wine) and the quality of the wine was incredibly disappointing. I ordered a Shiraz that tasted so cheap, I assumed the bottle was off and I asked for a new glass. It turns out the wine was just of a very low quality. The same is true of the California Cabernet which goes for $20 a glass. We didn't have any food because we refused to pay any more money at this establishment. The other aspect is the atmosphere: a cheesy club-esque environment complete with a DJ (playing a strange variety of low volume tunes) and a host of lady servers with short black skirts and backless tops. Not a classy joint. I will not return."}
{"text":"This is a solid elegant choice to dine in the downtown core.  I recommend the grilled calamari and the Sesame Seared Bigeye Tuna."}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2017 Dinner Review:  The dinner experience was alright. Service was ok, noise level is a bit on the high side.  Extra star for complimentary warm buns :) hmmm..!  Appetizers - Warm Pancetta & Fontina Gougères - was disappointed at how small this is, wasn't tasty at all, should have just ordered the seafood chowder. Very bland appetizer even with the sauce.  Main course - Braised Beef Short Rib Gnocchi & Chicken Coq au Vin - both meats are very tender! Serving size of the chicken entree was larger than the beef entree in my opinion. I would rate both dishes 4 out of 5 stars. Entree options are pretty good.  Dessert - Warm Chocolate Torte - was not warm, very disappointing piece of brownie I could have just bought from the convenience store.  Caramelized Custard Tart - at least this was better tasting than the chocolate dessert. But still, wasn't too impressed.  I would say that out of the dessert options, the Banana Tarte is the best choice.  Quite overpriced for the food quality. But the service and the winterlicious presentation was great. Entrees are good, but not so much for most of the appetizer and dessert options."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto for a conference, we stumbled on O & B and it was a good thing.  In a few trips, I've had a very delicious steak, perfect fried calamari, a yummy turkey club, and a gooey bacon butter tart.  Most enjoyable food experiences I had while here- even more than the rib fest at the Canada National Exhibition, which was good.  Also, Brandon T. was excellent in service and cheerful disposition."}
{"text":"Had business lunch last week and was quite disappointed.  We both ordered off the lunch winterlicious menu.  Started off with 2 green salads and the salads were poorly dressed and under seasoned.  We let our server know the issue and she said, \"would you like a new one or different salad\".  We were concerned that the entire meal was going to a disaster because if they couldn't get a basic salad right would it matter what they brought us.  The server wasn't able to understand where we were coming from and she continued to repeat, \"so can I get you new one or different one\".  She just wasn't getting it and the manager came over and assured us that the rest of the lunch would be fine and she took our order and kept checking.  The mains came and my business guest had the salmon and she didn't like it and I had the lamb sheppards pie which was ok.  Didn't care for the desserts either.  Wasn't a fan of this place and would not return to this restaurant or any restaurant under this brand.  The positive was the manager who did to address our concerns.  But my sense was what was wrong with this place was not going to be fixed over night.  Food: 2/5 Server: 1/5 Manager: 3/5"}
{"text":"I went here for a late dinner last night with a friend and was very pleasantly surprised when we found this place. My rating is based on venue, service and food.  Their patio (where we ate) is just lovely. Great for socializing with the 30-40something crowd, a DJ playing music and different types of seating all around for whatever kind of vibe you're going for. I'd come here again for the patio alone.   Service...It started out perfectly. We had a great waitress who was prompt with the drinks and attentive and tried to make us comfortable at a table where everyone had stolen the chairs. Then we ordered the food aaaand it never came lol. Neither did the waitress, to notice that we'd waited a really long time for the food. Pretty sure they just forgot about us, so when she came back and noticed that there was no food, she ran back and a minute later a manager came back and apologized very kindly about the delay. Said there was some kind of problem in the kitchen and that our food would be comped. Our food came out 2 minutes later. We weren't starving or anything so it was no big deal and the manager was very warm about the mistake. I would never not recommend this place because of that.   The food was good. I didn't order anything exemplary so maybe my rating would be different if I had ordered one of their specialties. I had a mushroom burger and my friend had a pizza. No complaints other than my side of fries was cold.   Anyway great place to meet people and have drinks, apps or dinner for a decent price."}
{"text":"2.5 stars bumped up to a three for a nice surprise at the end.  Did Winterlicious lunch here ($18). Not very impressed. Actually, slightly more disappointed than I thought I'd be. I went with 3 other people, but did the ordering for two out of the four of us.  The seafood chowder was quite nice. The smoked haddock added a nice depth of flavor to the chowder. The portion on this one was the most generous out of all the dishes we had that day, given that it was an appetizer.  The warm pancetta and fontina gougères (three pieces) were not three pieces. There were five. I did not know what this actually was. I googled it before coming. I liked what I saw, and I ordered it. It did not come out anything like what I expected. I was expecting something akin to a round croquette. I got something more like a puff pastry. There was a hint of cheese flavor, but definitely no pancetta. It sat on a small plate atop a round of cold tomato sauce and a few arugula leaves. It was also not warm. I don't know if it was the pancetta that was supposed to be warm or the gougeres, but the entire dish was room temperature leaning towards cold. Disappointed.  The yellowfin tuna tataki came with three (maybe four) pieces of tuna atop salad. This was not my entree. I am thankful for that, because if I had ordered that, I would have definitely needed more food. This dish was quite tasty, and the flavor combinations were delightful, but the portion was tiny.  The poached salmon portion is good for small eaters, but most people would be able to finish this one quite easily. My grandfather ate before he came and he still managed to finish this and have dessert. I ordered this one and so did my grandfather. Mine had bones. His did not. My salmon was warmer than room temp, but not by much. My poached egg was more softboiled than poached. It did not run at all. My grandfather's egg was even more cooked than mine. My favorite part of the dish was the beets. Nothing special about beets. They just tasted like beets.  The four of us got all four of the desserts, so I got to try everything.  Caramelized custard tart - nothing outstanding. Sweet. Grandpa enjoyed it though.  Banana tarte tatin - Tasted like a banana bread pudding with a whole lot of bananas. I like bananas. I thought the fresh cream was going to be whipped cream. I do not know if it was, or whether the whipped cream just melted. It looked puddle-y.  Warm chocolate torte - I believe this was actually warm when we got it. This is some dense chocolate. Good for chocolate lovers. I am not one.   Thunder Oak Gouda - I have never had cheese for dessert. We ordered this just for that reason. One wedge of cheese. Two crostini (who did the math here?). A generous amount of quince jelly. No knives provided. Were we supposed to make a sandwich? I do not know dessert cheese etiquette. I asked for a knife. This was my favorite dessert. I think it would have made a better appetizer than dessert, but what do I know. Quite savory, although also sweet. I thought the cheese would have more tang. Glad it did not. I'm not a fan of cheese tang. Crostini were delicious. Having had this, I'd be game to have cheese as dessert more often.  Odd thing. When they took our entree plates, they also took our napkins, but didn't give us new ones for dessert. Um..okay then. I did ask for some.  They gave us the bill before we asked for it, but told us to take our time. They just put the receipt on the table. No receipt holder. Just the receipt. Huh.  Surprise at the end:  We left the restaurant. Ended up at Loblaws. Grandpa had to go to the washroom. Went back to O&B to ask if they had a washroom (Grandpa's old. Can't walk too far. Handicap washroom at Loblaws was unavailable). A server showed us to the washroom. Mostly downstairs. One upstairs was being used. I ended up going as well. Why does O&B get that .5 star boost? Cuz they have the most delicious smelling washrooms. They smell like garlic butter. It's magical.  After this experience, I doubt I'd voluntarily come back, but it is nice to have finally tried a restaurant I've been walking past for years."}
{"text":"Definitely need reservations.   The food was good but portions were a bit light (portion size small).  The appetizers were so-so (nothing special), the mains of fish and beef was quite tasty and well presented.  The brownie dessert was really good but the popcorn ice cream was just ice cream with popcorn on top of the dish-why didn't I think of that :). The service was very good.  The environment was very comfortable-it is noisy (didn't bother us).  We came on Valentine's Day.   90 minutes an NO FOOD except 10 buns.  The food finally arrive after 95 minutes.  Not sure what to say except I'm really full of bread!"}
{"text":"I love this O+B restaurant. I have gone several times, typically for business lunches. Every meal I have tried has been excellent. For the service, food quality and location, the prices are very reasonable.  My fave dish is the vegan mushroom soup. Give it a try because they work some kind of magic in the kitchen. You will not know it is vegan!  I have had salads and they are all good. Same with the veg sandwich options. The bread is always delicious.   Last time I  went my friend had the bianca pizza. He said it was really good.  The ambience is nice as well. I find the acoustics to be agreeable with having a conversation.  Definitely my go-to place for lunch when I am in the business district."}
{"text":"I've ended up here a couple times for some after work drinks when in the Yonge and Front area. This is a good place if you dig the corporate vibe. The patio is covered, so it's good for rainy day patio drinking too.  We've tried a bunch of apps and all were good but quite pricey, so a few apps and drinks can add up quickly. While thats a normal thing for any O&B restaurant, this place has the worst service of the all O&B locations as well. So while I'm not hating the place, it's far from a place a would consider going unless being coerced by other people."}
{"text":"Upscale fast serve in a upscale mall  O & b gets it right and with a tasteful menu and great service you will enjoy your meal  I think this is the great Sunday brunch spot  Where else can you enjoy Eggs Benni and shakshuka in York Region?  Kid friendly too  The only complaint i have is that it can get pretty loud at times  Resto's should think to add some sound damping instead of all the hard surfaces to tame all that plate clanking from the kitchen  What really sets these guys apart is that they understand service and how to make their guests feel good when dining....and that's what we want"}
{"text":"3.5/5  I was here for a corporate lunch and it is definitely not your everyday meal sort of thing - venue is absolutely stunning - spacious, open, with modern decorations.   Service was attentive as the waitress came by to fill our water and ask if we had questions, however our wait for entrées was extremely long. I was expecting a 15 min wait and it felt like eons before we got our food.   I ordered the crab and cod cake - it was scrumptious and had an avocado crème which I enjoyed. Not too bready like others have mentioned (or maybe I'm a carb lover) My colleagues got the fish and chips, mushroom soup, pasta. Definitely a fancier place but may be back for fancier occasions."}
{"text":"I had a pretty mediocre experience here which was disappointing because there's so much hype behind O&B restaurants and at the more expensive prices you expect to have better service but alas that is not always the case. Also I was expecting more from their menu but it all seemed run of the mill for me - some pastas, some pizzas, nothing unique that stood out. I ordered their prosciutto pizza which did hit the spot and my husband's order of fish & chips looked satisfying. But again, I was just expecting more. So I'd recommend going for the convenience of its location (very close to Union stn) and with low expectations."}
{"text":"Most disappointing dinner I've experienced in a while. I ate here this past weekend upon a friend's recommendation. My friend and I ordered the ravioli and the gnocchi.   The ravioil was positively swimming in water. I suspect this is because they cooked it directly in the pan with spinach and mushroom, and didn't bother to reduce the liquid or make a sauce, and served it practically as a soup. My friend's gnocchi was very mediocre, with nothing bad (or good) to say about it. The saving grace was the beet salad. That's hard to mess up!  All in all, I would recommend taking a pass on Oliver & Bonacini, especially given the price. O&B unabashed about their pricing!  Service was quite good. The server we had was very capable and friendly."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was disappointing, such as roast beef ordered medium rare being served well done and tough.  We were a large group and no one felt it was a dining experience worth repeating."}
{"text":"Was here recently for a group dinner, there were easily 20 of us.  We were celebrating 2 people in the group and had let one of the servers know that their meals/drinks were to be covered by the rest of the group.  Our servers were great, very knowledgeable and quite accommodating.  We had underestimated the number of people who would be attending and they easily added a couple more tables to our already large area. It was a busy Thursday evening so, it was no easy task.  While I cannot speak for everyone in the group, the 7 people in my area quite enjoyed their meals...not a single complaint.  We had a person with a severe seafood allergy and they were able to pinpoint which dishes were safe for her to order without any back and forth between the kitchen.  At the end of the meal we all received separate checks, without having to make the request and the 2 meals for our special guests, along with their cocktails had been evenly divided amongst the rest of the attendees.  Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Great meal tonight with colleagues. Nice atmosphere. Good service. Really tasty food. I had the duck with mustard spätzle--fabulous."}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner before a concert.  Our waiter, Dan, was wonderful.  I had the special, a filet with horseradish bernaise sauce, charred brussel sprouts, and a twice baked potato, my dinner parter had the BBQ Strip Loin.  Both were absolutely delicious.  We followed that with the Chefs Platter for desert - it was all incredible."}
{"text":"A classic downtown Toronto spot. This place is quite busy after work hours which is a testament to how good the food and service is. The Mac and cheese is actually awesome here!!"}
{"text":"Had watermelon soup, carrot cake and pork tacos for summerlicious with mango soda.  Great service and food was great as always."}
{"text":"A friend invited me to have a brunch at this restaurant. It looks high class on the outside but the inside is not as trendy as I have expected. At first, the waitress seated my wife and me led at a booth near the entrance of the restaurant but my wife felt uncomfortable of where we were sitting and so we have requested to sit somewhere else. Then, we were directed to sit next to the window at an individual table which was much more better.  I ordered a beer for myself and two items, O & B Mushroom Soup and a Burger with Yellowfin Tuna  to share with my wife.   O & B Mushroom Soup (score: 3/5) The presentation of the soup is quite unique. I like it. It was just soup with a little bit of chives and mushroom in the centre as shown in the picture. When I had the first spoonful of taste, I was not certain of what I was having and so I tried a second spoonful again. I might have an expectation of strong taste of mushroom in my mind. The actual taste did not match what I had expected and so I was a bit disappointed. The soup didn't have much flavour to me.  Burger with Yellowfin Tuna (score 3.7/5) I was surprised to see the bun was in dark brown, something that surprised me which was awesome!! Again, it's the presentation that impressed me. There were a fair bit amount of avocado sauce with lettuce and sprouts + a few pieces of tuna in the burger. It's quite challenging to eat with the regular utensils, fork and knife that they have provided and so I requested for a steak knife. The avocado sauce tasted good and it almost took over the taste of the burger. For the veggies and tuna, they were small loose pieces and it's really hard to hold the burger in my hand and eat it.   To me, this restaurant specializes at showcase of their food. It will be a good place for socializing having a cup of tea and coffee. If you are looking for extraordinary taste of food, it may not be the right place."}
{"text":"The food is just ok. The cod I ordered is salty. The steak is ok. The grilled octopus is ok. Nothing special. The service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"I had my bday weekend in Toronto and decided to come to O&B Grill for dinner.  The space is beautiful and I love the modern feel.  The front reception is strange as upon entry you're greeting by not 1 hostess but 4 people.  Besides feeling awkward and uncertain of who to ask a table from, we were seated immediately indoors for our fairly early dinner (7pm).  Our server was cheerful and attentive throughout the entire meal.  We began our meal with the crispy spring rolls, which came out piping hot and delicious.  The ginger and carrot dipping sauce was a bit bland but the spring rolls were quite tasty.  For our entrees, my bf ordered the fish special for the day which was pan-fried Arctic Char over a bed of root vegetable puree and watercress.  Yes, it was a-mazing!  The veggies had so much going on and had such interesting spices.  Not spicy in heat but intense in flavor!  I'm also a huge fan of Arctic Char - it's the perfect marriage between trout and salmon.  As for my entrée, I went with their Asian Ceasar salad and was impressed with all the unique flavors going on in my dish.  It was really delicious and if it wasn't for the spring rolls and my second helping of their warm bread, I would have finished my entire plate.  The salad had peanuts, fennel as well as a really unique dressing.  I loved every bite of it!  However, the only complaint I had was their use of Romaine instead of watercress or mixed greens base, but it's minor in comparison to how great our meal was.  Great date spot and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I went there for my first time with a big group of friends as a Christmas gathering dinner. I ordered the fried oyster mushrooms to share with two other friends and the liver as main course. Both were awesome. The liver was more than I expected. There were two pieces of it with my favourite asparagus as decor and bacon and mashed potatoes. There were also lots of veggies on the side with a very small tasty plum (atleast that's what I think it was). The liver melted so quickly once I put it in my mouth. It was a loaded entree and I was so full from it. The price of it was great too, very reasonable. My friend tried the salmon which she gave me a piece to try. It was very delicious and you can tell it's fresh seafood. Most of the guys in my group ordered the steak and they've said good things about it too.   As for the service, it was awesome as well. Some of my friends were terribly late but the servers kept ensuring that we have enough water and as more of my friends came before we ordered they served us delicious dinner rolls. After ordering our food, a few guys left the table to buy something at a store before it closed nearby. Meanwhile their dishes were ready but they weren't back yet. The servers urged us to call them back quickly because reheating or leaving their food warmed in the kitchen will ruin the true tastes."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, service was good, portions were small and that really didn't go well for me or my husband."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I bring a lot of friends who are new to the city if we're walking about downtown - it's nice, but not too pricey, with great ambiance. A wee bit loud, but vibrant. I think the food is amazing and it's the one place I always try something new as I know I won't be disappointed (except for the pizzas - I would skip those).   I've had:  - gnocchi (pretty good) - steak (definitely recommend - ask for it Chicago style plus your preferred cooking inside)  - margherita pizza (meh)  - scallops (rich and delicious!)  - Tuscan onion soup  - caprese salad  - Caesar salad  - onion rings (definitely recommend)  - special ricotta ravioli on the tutta pasta menu (amazing)  - and I LOVE their buns!  Everything is yummy and a normal serving size (I hate getting huowge plates of pasta I will never finish). My only complaint is I don't like the maple bacon on the Caesar salads...but that's just preference.   Can't wait for summer so I can sit on what looks like a great patio!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 14 for a work lunch, and the service was quite poor.  Our server seemed angry with us the entire time and would shove menus in our faces (as we're in mid-conversation) and slam cutlery on the table, amongst other annoyances.    The food itself was mediocre.  We orders the crab cakes, fish tacos, calamari and edamame.  The calamari was well done, but I thought the batter on the fish taco was too thick and the crab cakes not as flavourful as I would have liked.  My main was the steak salad, I would have preferred more of the ingredients mentioned in the description (I.e., more than a half finger of roasted potato).   To elaborate on the arrive, when they mixed up my order with my colleague's, the server's explanation was \"she took your food\", when a simple \"sorry for our mix-up\" would have been more appropriate.  Then, the rejected food that was brought back to the kitchen was brought to me it looked like it was picked through).  From a restaurant such as this, I would expect to be presented a new dish or at least be asked if serving a dish that was sent back was acceptable.    For a group our size, with a bill totalling over $1,300 - this service was disgraceful and the food mediocre. The icing on this cake wreck is that there was no toilet paper in the washroom.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say there's anything wrong with Oliver & Bonacini I would instead say it's not great value. On any given night you can expect to spend $20+ on a main course that will be good but unspectacular. This problem gets worse when they have holiday specials which tend to add $10 to every plate for little to no further increase in quality. It's not that I won't go back but I wouldn't make O&B my first choice."}
{"text":"Okay, so my rating has gone down from the first time I went here.   I came again, with my family, for my birthday, at the beginning of October. Even though we had a reservation, our table wasn't ready. We were finally seated and the waiter introduced himself...and then disappeared. Came back ten minutes later and took drink orders and then disappeared for 15 minutes...this continued the entire time. Our dinner took A LONG time. It took forever for our drinks to be served and even longer for our food to come out. Then when the food came out, we got two plates and then waited five minutes for one more plate...then waited another five minutes for another plate. It took our group 15 minutes just for us all to receive the food! Obviously we couldn't eat until everyone had been served and the food was getting cold at that point.  Oh, the best part?? Someone mentioned it was my birthday and the waiter said, \"Oh, so you're a January baby,\" indicating to when I was conceived...to my parents. Yes...thank you sir. I would really like to be reminded of my parents' doing it, right before dinner...because that's completely appropriate.   So yes, the service this time was TERRIBLE!   BUT, everyone enjoyed their food and thought it was really good, so there ya have it. Service hit or miss, but food is good."}
{"text":"I was here on 2 occasions. One brunch and one afternoon tea. Both were pretty average. Brunch was overpriced but afternoon tea for 2 for only around $12. (TLDR at the end)   Brunch - Ordered the:   - Eggs benedict: the egg+ham+bread together was pretty good. Potatoes with it were a little bland and dry. Average. - Turkey club (or was it chicken club?): didn't get a taste but it looked pretty good. But the meat in it looked a little dry.  - Spinach and feta shakshuka (?): overly sour, not spiced enough (literally. it was only sour. barely any other taste). 2 eggs in side but the white was chewy. came with 2 pieces of wheat bread. Not worth its money tbh.  - sparkling mint blood orange drink: pretty good , liked it.   Afternoon Tea - there were no menu but it was a set 4 pieces of desserts (not sure if the set changes every once in a while). We got a brownie, cheesecake, lemon custard, and carrot cake. The cheesecake and carrot cake were pretty good but nothing that out of the ordinary.   TLDR: Overall, if you wanted to eat at an upscale place, you could probably get better food for the same price. everything was average. If you REALLY wanted to go, I suggest to go for afternoon tea. It was cute."}
{"text":"Quality of this place seems to have gone downhill in the last year, not sure if it's due to the talent leaving for cooler, newer and hipper O&Bs now opened at TIFF and Front St.   Came here for brunch a week ago. The home style potatoes used to be herbed pieces of potato goodness (you could see green sprinkles of herbs), now they are the generic kind you can get at the groceries freezer aisle. The burger that used to be delish is now meh (it's hard to get such a meh burger at most places at that price!)  Came here for Summerlicious too and most of us were disappointed with the meal. Mussels broth was really tasteless. Same could be said of the battered cod. The highlights were the dessert.  On the other hand, I love the recent meals I've had at O&B at Tiff lightbox. If only it was a little closer and more convenient."}
{"text":"12 p.m. business lunch here last Thursday, party of three.  Long line-up to get in the door just to tell the front of house your reservation name (there was clearly no space for people without reservations)... I was irritated, but then I saw the people I was meeting already seated, so I slipped past the line.  It looks SO DIFFERENT from Shopsy's - awesome!!! Very sleek, modern, mostly black & white... greys, neutrals, almost Asian-inspired. The feng shui was rocking in this joint, as it were.  I wouldn't go here again for a business lunch where conversation is a priority... it's quite loud, and I imagine always packed as it was on my visit.  I had the mini Margherita pizza (tomatoes, bocconcini & basil) with the spinach salad (with the most delicate slices of green apple I've ever seen and a nice \"honeycup mustard\" dressing) - you could choose fries instead of a salad, and you could also have a Caesar or mixed green salad. Mine was $11.95. Pizza was absolutely forgettable. It was fine. I wouldn't say good. The salad was OK. Presentation was awesome... but I was expecting more. It seemed to suffer from a half-hearted effort and lack of inspiration.  One of my dining partners ordered a large Caesar with chicken and the other ordered the (somewhat famous) macaroni and cheese with chicken, goat & Balderson cheddar cheese, with peas for $14.95. Both cleaned their plates, as did I, so I assume it was all good. Portions were HUGE. Is this just an O&B thing?  We also tried the daily fresh juices - today was strawberry lemonade and very nice. I love that.  The server must be applauded for her upselling - she asked me if I wanted whole wheat dough (no), asked us if we wanted to start with something, offered add-ins to everyone at the table, and pushed coffee and dessert like they're going out of style.  Frankly, if you're in the area and looking for a nice lunch, skip this place. Go next door to Biff's instead!"}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2013 at the O&B was worth it.   For appetizer I ordered the Borscht Soup, the flavors of the tomato and beet puree with Dill creme fraiche was a hit.  The texture was perfect, not too thick nor watery.  The entree, was Slow Braised Lamb Shoulder Cassoulet navy beans, green beans & pine nut gremolata.  The portion, taste, and orchestra of flavor complimented each other.  The Lamb was cooked to perfection, and the beans gave it that comfort food type of feeling.  for Dessert, the carrot cake, was nothing to die for however the brown butter bread pudding would have been a better choice.  To top it off, the staff and service was very efficient, and the ambiance was modern and contemporary.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to O&B before at Bayview Village during last years Winterlicious 2012 and it was impressive.  Since there was a closer location to my work, I figured I'd give it a try.  Met up for lunch with a family member, this place is busy, but nonetheless a gem near Union station.  Golden Tomato Gazpacho: beautiful medley of flavors, lime, avocado pure with a nacho chip inside. Presentation was magnificent. 4/5  Shrimp & Salmon Cake: again, presentation was notable, fresh, local ingredients, perfect balance of flavors, on a bed of lightly dressed arrugula salad. 5/5  Butter tart cake: our waiter went out of his way to have the raisins excluded! big plus in my books! this was probably the best tart Ive ever had, pure blissfulness! 5/5  Side note, they have a nice outdoor patio, and the waiters/waitresses were very kind, and courteous.  Overall a great experience! do check it out if you're near the area..... or there's Frans right around the corner :P"}
{"text":"I came here today for a corporate lunch, and had reservations at 12pm. We were seated right away and it wasn't too busy, but got busy as the lunch hour passed.  I ordered the seared albacore tuna, but substituted the white bean salad for the spinach salad- not sure I made a good choice there. The spinach salad was a little too sweet for my liking, and the albacore was overly salty! Next time, I might try the steak! We also ordered the peach creme brûlée for dessert, which was a good size for sharing.  The decor is very modern and clean but food is average."}
{"text":"Super tasty, but for the price it's not worth it. Portion size of the eggs and lox was super tiny, and the hash was mostly potatoes with a few bits of beef.  The coffee is super bitter but the fresh juice is delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero star. I went there last week with my husband and father. 1) my husband asked to have the sausages butterflied and replace the home fries with french fries. Waiter came back later and said they cant butterfly the sausage since its pre-cooked and also cant replace the home fries. He has to buy the french fries as additional side dish. 2) my father asked for a freshly squeezed orange juice which they didnt have. They only had mix of 2 juices and it was pre-mixed so they couldnt give him a juice of just one fruit. We were like for God sake its O & B. Every average place change the home fries with french fries, have orange juice and never heard of pre-cooked sausage in a decent reataurant. And when they brought the food, my husband sent back his dish since he had asked for over easy eggs and they were really cooked and hard eggs. We were like what kind of chef cant even cook two over easy eggs?!!! And my egg benedicts were one of the worst I ever had. The egg was again dry, the holandais sause was so little and the english muffin was too dry and too sweet. The only good food was my dad's which he shared with me cuz I hate dry egg bendicts.. O& B is close to our home but this is the last time I will go there. Too bad didnt take any picture"}
{"text":"I've been here on three occasions: I've had drinks on Yong St. patio area, a small dinner with a friend on the Front St. patio and a large group dinner in a private room inside.  They were all positive experiences and given O&B's central location, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it again as a convenient meeting spot with great food.    The time I was here with a large group was particularly memorable since we had a private room that created a wonderfully intimate atmosphere and the server didn't make too much of a fuss about a constantly updated guest list (people dropping by unexpectedly, etc.).  Definitely a great place to do a large group dinner and then head off somewhere in the area."}
{"text":"We went to O & B for a birthday dinner. For a party of 16 people we were given the party room. The service was incredible from the host to the server. There were periods where there wasn't a waiter available but then again  we were in a private food. I split Margarita pizza and the salmon dinner. The food was served promptly and correctly which is important especially for a large order. The pizza was a little bland and average. The basil and sauce were good but the mozzarella tasted dated. The salmon was fresh but could have used better sides."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious with a group of 5 last year. I ordered the warm wild mushroom focaccia, salmon filet and lemon cake.   The focaccia was good but the side (pickled vegetables) was overly salted and sour. The salmon filet was average, slightly overcooked and the skin was slightly slimy and not crispy compared to others I've had or can make at home.  Overall, I'd skip this place next Summerlicious."}
{"text":"OB is a decent restaurant. I've eaten there numerous times with my family for dinner. I can't really say that the food here has blown me out of the water but it certainly has not done anything to prevent me from coming back.  Here is what I've eaten at OB:  Grilled Calamari - very light breading which is really good. Their dipping sauce is different but not bad.  Vine Ripened Tomato & Buffalo Mozzarella - Not as big as I would have liked but you can't go wrong with tomato and mozzarella.  Spring Roll Basket - They bring these out halved. There are 6 of them. I actually really like these. The dipping sauces complement the spring rolls very well.   Buttermilk Battered Onion Rings - Not really sure why this is on the menu. I think they're trying to do an asian/american fusion thing here. Not a big fan of these.  Classic Burger - pretty much a classic burger. If you want something safe, get this.  Margherita Pizza - Another safe yet good dish.   Rock Shrimp Linguine - Not bad. Didn't have that WOW factor that I like to get.  Sesame Seared Yellowfin Tuna - The tuna was cooked very well. I definitely liked the way they paired the fish with the rest of the dish.  Grilled Atlantic Salmon - Salmon was a bit overcooked the time I got it and have never gotten it again. The ratatouille was pretty good though.  Service-wise, the staff is very friendly and check up on you. I would give OB a 3.5 but I can't and it doesn't deserve a 4 star so it's stuck with a 3 until I go back and they change my mind."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place numerous times and always kept saying I need to check it out...so on the weekend I did!  This place is huge inside - could easily hold 100+ people.  They have a section in the back for private parties.  The whole restaurant is beautiful inside - if you want to impress a date, your mother in law this is the place to go.  The brunch menu is simple with about 10 or so choices.  Which is great because an overwhelming amount of choices makes me wonder about quality.  I had the fried chicken and french toast.  3 pieces of the most delicious fried chicken (crispy on the outside...super moist on the inside) served on brioche bread with orange maple syrup.  Everything was yum...but unfortunately they had doused the french toast with the syrup...it was swimming in it. To me this ruins the beautiful crispiness of french toast...to the point where you only taste the syrup.  This is why I gave it 3 stars and not 4.  I figure a great chef should know you can't douse your meal in sauce (or at least have the sauce in a separate container so the person can pour on themselves)   The service was nice and they have a small patio in the front if you want to get your sun on while eating.  A great place for mother's day brunch/lunch!"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience dining here this Thursday. Our party came around 12pm and we were seated promptly. The restaurant has very modern, chic decor which enhances the relaxing, sociable environment.   I ordered the Turkey Burger ($19) and was very satisfied with my order. The meat was well seasoned, juicy, and flavourful. I loved that it included avocado and an onion ring, which I thought paired really well with the meat. Also, I mostly chose this meal for the sweet potato fries and Sriracha Mayo dipping sauce and I was not disappointed. Overall, the price was reasonable for the size of the meal so no complaints there. The service was also impressive. I'll likely come again."}
{"text":"It's pricey, but extremely tasty.  We stopped in here for dinner last week.  It was absolutely delicious! We each ordered a glass of wine, and I'm super happy that my love for moscato was rekindled at this dinner.  We ordered fish tacos and the seared tuna appetizers.  Both were delicious.   For our mains, we split the mac and cheese, the butter chicken and an amazing japanese inspired chicken caesar salad.  I'm glad my DC was my BF, because we ordered so much food!    Everything was delicious.  The service was great.  I have no complaints.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We are not happy with the food here.  The service is awesome and took care of us but the food and the price just didn't match.  I ordered the fish and chips which was mediocre.  The 2 pieces of fish were small and over battered but the house tartar was very good.  I was hoping for something impressive for $17.95 but I was wrong.  I seem to be striking out with the fish and chips... Maybe I should go back to meat.  Lew ordered the butter chicken... Yes, I know that you don't order an ethnic dish in a \"white\" restaurant but it was worth the try.  She was hoping that they would try to make it well, sadly it missed the mark.  The chicken was over-cooked and not seasoned.  The rice was bland and not worth the $15.95.  We've had some awesome butter chicken from the local supermarket for under $10. Overall, the experience was very mixed.  The waiter really was great, we had our son with us and the waiter tried to make him happy.  The food is not what we expected.  I think that they need to work on the quality if they are going to be charging so much."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch this week. The ravioli special was amazing, but on the expensive side, and a very small portion (about 5-6 small pieces of ravioli).   While the food was good, the server was a little condescending towards our table. The main reason for my two star rating though, was that when asked whether we wanted sparking or still water, we said regular still water. When the bill came, we were each charged for water. When we asked about it, we were told that it was because it's filtered water, and that we should have specified tap water. The water they brought us was the regular metal pitcher, until the last round of water where they brought a glass jar to the table.   It wasn't worth fighting over at the time, but you need to be more upfront about this, and inform your guests that still water is charged differently from tap water."}
{"text":"My girls took me here as a part of my bachelorette party because I have had really good experiences here for Summerlicious.   Not going to lie, but maybe because there are so many more selections that it was actually difficult to choose something that I wanted to eat. Completely out of the ordinary, I selected the mac and cheese ... with mushrooms and spinach. I shared a greens salad with the girls which included beets and endives. To my surprise, when the salad came, I clarified twice that this was the salad I got because there were NO BEETs. One person said, yes this is the right salad ... the other waitress told me it was the garnish.... please do not sell me on a garnish on your menu. that is completely false advertising, in my opinion. Truthfully, the salad was greens with vinaigrette. Totally disappointed with the starter.  The mains came out and I was surprised (not in a bad way) that the dish came out in a pasta dish, not one of those baked ceramic ones. It looks rich and delicious and thank goodness it was just that. The mushrooms gave it the right texture, and there were different cheeses that added flavour with each bite. The spinach also added to the overall dish... I wish there was more spinach and mushrooms.  My friends who got the butter chicken and one of the pastas said it was mediocre so I guess I lucked out.  For dessert, the chocolate tarte was shared - i had it at summerlicious and knew it was going to be good. and it was.  After this, I'm thinking I might stick with summer / winterlicious."}
{"text":"A great casual place where the food is consistently good at decent prices. Great for a business lunch or even a brunch on the weekend. It's a place I keep coming back to every now and then. Definitely recommended if you are downtown."}
{"text":"I came over the weekend with the intention of having brunch, right before my massage appointment. It was fairly busy, with lineup out the door. Since I was alone, I was able to grab a seat right away at the bar. Yay! I ordered a smoked salmon egg Benedict croissant, and server said it will be ready in 20 minutes due to the high volume of customers. I didn't mind and ordered a mango peach mimosa while I waited. Mimosa was only $5 a glass!! It was a good price and I couldn't say no to that. As soon as I finished my mimosa, an older lady plopped down beside me. She was definitely a regular customer, and you can tell by all the hugs  and kisses she was giving to all the employees that worked there. By the time, I ordered a second mimosa, the lady beside me already got her quiche and salad?!!! I certainly felt neglected and had to inquire the server why my food was taking so long. When my food did arrive, I had to get it packed to go since I was running late for my massage. I was hoping to enjoy my brunch in the restaurant, but unfortunately that didn't happen. This experience did not make me feel like a valued customer, simply because I wasn't a regular customer. As soon I got to my car, it turned out they didn't even bother giving me any utensils or napkins?! Not sure whether I should return to this establishment or not...even though their brunch & mimosas are really good! :/"}
{"text":"Slightly confused about their cuisine. We went for winterlicious but a lot of the items had a lot of Louisiana/Cajun flare - not what I was expecting. The food didn't impress me but the decor and service is always good there. I will visit again when their menu changes."}
{"text":"The idea of having better food in mall situations than that of the traditional fast food joints is a great idea...when the food is good.  when its worth its weight in the gold you pay for it.  this place had exorbitant prices for food that didn't match up.  not that there wasnt any good food.  i tried a yellowfin tuna tartare with avocado and potato chips with a type of soy sauce.  the tuna was tender, the avocado fresh. that was the highlight. the presentation was nice. that was 14 bucks.  i tried a fusili with smoked chicken, mixed mushrooms, snow peas and extra virgin olive oil.  the pasta was overcooked and not rich in taste either. 15 bucks.  which i could stand paying for were it good.  i had a caesar salad, again hoping for and expecting some greens that were remarkable.  this salad could have easily been lifted from kelseys and put on this plate.  it was completely boring in taste and presentation.  I cared more about the taste lacking really.  you can say a caesar salad is a caesar salad and for the most part youd be right because youve probably tasted crappy ones most of your life.  i, on the other hand, have tried my friend dee's caesar salad - that was vegetarian even - and it was so rich in taste and served over large romaine leaves.  its all in the dressing.    fries and onion rings: go to your local diner and get these and theyd be better.  their 'special' spicy tomato mayo doesnt do wonders for any of it.  finally to my fish.  i had the red snapper in a garlic parsley butter.  that was served on top of beans and pasta with onions and garlic in a white wine fennel broth.  The fished was cooked well but had no remarkable taste, nor did the bean and pasta broth.  I didnt even finish the meal and I was hungry for it.  The service was mediocre.  It was not too packed when we came and both the beer and wine I ordered took forever to come;  a second order of ice cream for nutbar kiddies came after they had to leave.  They seemed overwhelmed and unorganized it seemed to me.  If I am going to pay a pretty penny, especially these days when we might be searching under our mattresses or raiding fountains for pennies, the food better be exquisite both in taste and design and the service better be excellent."}
{"text":"Best part of this restaurant was the super friendly hostess and the outside patio. Other than that, my brunch was not memorable.   I came at around 11am on a Sunday and it was dead (words from the hostess, and I agreed). She seated me alone at a 4 top, which would be unheard of in NYC, so I was gracious.   But this is where the good times stopped. After sitting for about 5 minutes, with only one other table sitting outside (this place is huge) I had to go inside and request a server to come to my table. Smh. Then took another 3 minutes for someone to finally come. Service was lacking the whole meal. And there were like 2 servers and 3 busboys walking around, but no one bothered to come my way unless I turned around with an exasperated look on my face.   I had the green smoothie bowl, with a matcha and banana smoothie, granola, and fresh fruit. It was good, but too watery. And I had to request a spoon (more waiting). Wouldn't recommend, wish I'd tried the short rib hash. $5 mimosas helped calm me.   The whole experience was a struggle. I could easily give this place a higher rating, had the staff been more personable. I'm not saying treat me like I'm the only one in the place (I nearly was), but put in more effort to accommodate guests."}
{"text":"Maybe I was starving, but the service here on weekends seems constantly slow.  Well it's weekend, we should just take it slow and relax :)  That was the second time I came here for brunch.  The reception was friendly.  We were brought to a patio table right away.  Menus were given to us soon too.  Then, no server came to take our order until almost 15 minutes later.  That 15 minutes was quite long at the moment because I and actually we were starving.  My bf ordered the Eggs Benedict and I had the O&B Breakfast that came with eggs, bacons, sausages, roasted tomato, multi-grain toast and fried potatoes.  Food is definitely OK at a reasonable price.  I especially like the way the fried potatoes were made.  We enjoyed the patio brunch there for people watching as well!  They have $3 Caesars and mimosas throughout the Summer on Saturdays and Sundays before 4pm!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early Valentine's day brunch with a human female. I made reservations earlier in the week via OpenTable. I've been to 14 previous restaurants using OpenTable and this was the first time I've encountered a restaurant that didn't have my table ready. We were given the option to wait or seated on the mall patio. We chose the mall patio for immediate seating. O&B's idea of immediate seems to make you wait again  and look to remind your hostess.   We both had the breakfast plate. After the lame eggs benny I had at the Gilead Care (http://www.yelp.com/biz/gilead-cafe-and-bistro-toronto#hrid:1kXrAnMeRwMhhHgcY0A-7Q) I've come to the conclusion Toronto's upmarket brunch purveyors view it as the ultimate sucker meal. Charge a lot, give little.  The breakfast plate, however, was without taste. The sausage had no flavor.   I saw the waitress to take our order, eventually bring us our food and coffee, and then the bill. I'm not sure how O&B think about brunch but a \"freshen up your coffee\" stop in is part of the brunch experience in any sane dining environment.  Anyway, food sucks, waitress does the bare minimum (and got a 7% tip), the hostess can't figure out how to hold tables for reservations...  This really darkens my opinion of the O&B chain and will probably give any restaurant in their \"empire\" a big pass."}
{"text":"Where to go downtown when the rich aunt and uncle are paying but you don't want to make it seem like you're super milking them. Canoe? Natch. Your O&B properties are fairly safe life style choices and up market enough that you don't feel like you're squandering an opportunity when rich aunt and uncle are footing the bill.  Service is quite good. Nothing really wow'd me with the food on the menu. I had the classic burger. $14 for a burger and some fries seasoned with oregano or basil.   CUTE! Chinese Girl had the salmon and was quite happy with it. Rich uncle had the burger as well. Rich aunt had a lamb sheppard's pie that was the special of the day. Rich aunt and uncle ultimately enjoyed it.  Decor is nice. Sure the patio would be nice too.  Ultimately nothing mind blowing but safe when you're in mixed company with your elders."}
{"text":"This is your typical bar/pub food place. I didn't think it was anything special. The food was meh at best. The decor, location, and service was excellent however. We had a burger and fish sticks and have definitely had better."}
{"text":"I had Thanksgiving dinner here and I was a little disappointed with the meal. The description sounded wonderful: turkey with mashed potatoes, roasted carrots, brussels sprouts, sage and apple stuffing and cranberry relish ($28).   The portion of food was incredibly small for $28. I saw half of one brussels sprout on my plate (after searching for a minute, though) and there was about a tablespoon of gravy on the plate. Flavours were ok but the carrots were still crunchy and the stuffing (served in individual muffin portion) was lukewarm.   They had a Sunday roast dinner on as well, served with Yorkshire pudding, which I love, so I asked if I could have one with my dinner. The waiter said he'd see what he could do. It arrived on my friend's plate, and it was cold. Not good. Even worse was when I found out AFTER (when the bill came) that I was charged $2 for it. If I'd known I would be charged for it, I'd have asked for it to be warmed up.   For dessert, I had their special sticky toffee pudding with rum raisin ice cream. It was good, but definitely not what I'd call a pudding. It was like a muffin/cake with sauce poured over it.   Nowhere near as good as my home cooked turkey dinner, but since this is my first Thanksgiving in Toronto, I certainly wasn't going to make a turkey dinner this year. Maybe next year when I know more people!   Service was decent, but I didn't like how the server refused to make any substitutions or modifications. One of the guests at our table is vegan and asked for a pizza with no cheese, but was told they were \"too busy\" to accommodate her request. I've never heard of a cook who was too busy to leave off an ingredient. Bizarre."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of anything Oliver & Bonacini.  I made reservations here for brunch with some girlfriends.    I had never been to this location before, but as expected it was large and  well decorated.  They had a good selection of breakfast and lunch options.  I wanted my favourite Mac and cheese but opted to try the three bean chilli with two poached eggs and a cheese and scallion scone.  It was delicious and filling.  I couldn't finish it.  My three girl friends all got the eggs Benny.  They were all vegetarians and there were no problems substituting the meat for something else - in fact is was suggested by the waitress.  Service was great.  We were there for at least an hour after we paid our bill just chatting and were never bothered.  If you're not familiar with the area - I wasn't - it's important to note that you won't see the place just driving down bay view.  Either turn onto east onto Shepard and then you'll see it on the left attached to the mall, or if you continue past Shepard on bayview, turn into the loblaws parking lot and the restaurant will be right behind it.  If you take Ttc it's right off of the bayview subway stop.  Good to know because this is a great in between spot for the gals."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing I had the lamb and it was to die for. I love the traditional canadian cuisine this restaurant has. The service is excellent and I love all the menu options. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I organized a group dinner here with some friends from school.  I was a big fan of the round table we were seated at.  I prefer round tables for groups because it's easier to talk to everyone at the table.  We had to wait a bit for everyone to arrive.  The waiter was great at this time.  Promptly greeting everyone and asking if they wanted a drink.  He was like this the entire duration of the meal, always making sure we were satisfied and didn't need anything else.  I was happy that they had a rose on the wine menu.  I love rose wine, and do not often see it on the wine list.    For the meal I started with a small caesar salad.  For my main I had the mac and cheese with chicken and pees.  Mac and cheese is my favorite dish, so I always like to try it at different restaurants.  No complaints on the caesar; it was nice and fresh.    The mac and cheese was different than what I was used to, but not in a bad way.  It wasn't a strong cheddar flavour, but still very tasty.  It had breadcrumbs sprinkled on top which gave it a nice texture.  I have never had peas and chicken in my mac and cheese.  I didn't know if I'd like it, but am sure glad I tried it because it was delightful!  I would recommend this dish to any mac and cheese lover.      There were a lot of dishes on the menu that I wanted to try so I will be coming back to this restaurant again.  The service was fantastic, and the good was great.  Everyone else was very pleased with their meal as well.  It was a good atmosphere for the group, and I can see it being a nice spot for a date too."}
{"text":"Tried here for Summerlicious. Dinner was $28. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular for a meal that expensive. The most negative thing about this place was that the portions were pathetically small. Salad was small. Main course was really small and the desert was okay. I don't eat a lot and even I found the portions were just way too small for a cost of $28."}
{"text":"Have been before and service was bad. 2 years later still no Improvement will waited 30 minutes for food to arrive after we ordered it the potato salad was so small it's probably a quarter cup for $16 and the roast beef panini was old Taste"}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping, I needed some food! Ever experienced that? Obviously.   I was at Bayview Village, one of my favourite malls. I decided to go with Oliver and Bonacini. Every-time I've eaten here, I usually regret it.   The food is very plain, nothing special and over priced.   Started off with the Margarita Pizza, that was decent. Great amount of cheese and sauce. I wish the sauce was more flavourful.   The Mac and Cheese with Bacon was very very very disappointing. The Bacon wasn't crispy (I asked for Crispy Bacon) The cheese sauce was so bland, lacked so much flavour. The noodles were very al dante.   Finally, tried the special - Ravioli with Swiss Chard (Don't order this) It had ZERO flavour. The ravioli wasn't cooked properly.   The service wasn't the greatest. The restaurant was not busy at all. There were maybe 10 tables in the entire restaurant that had customers, yet I had to wait 20 minutes for the bill."}
{"text":"Was there for dinner this past Friday. My 4th visit to this location.  Yes it has great atmosphere, great staff and a decent menu ... However, the food on my last two visits was sub par ... And this past Friday was the worst yet.  It took forever for the food to arrive.  The pasta was swimming in so much oil it wasn't edible.  The truffle gnocchi didn't even look like gnocchi and it was so mushy and there wasn't a hint of truffle.  Both dishes we returned and thankfully OB credited our bill.  Not ever coming back to this location.  Peter Oliver needs to overhaul this location to the same standards as the other OB locations."}
{"text":"Neat patio. Nothing too special. Food quality is quite standard. Great for post work beverage with colleagues.   3.25/5 *"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch over the weekend and I am surprised! I haven't had such a good service in a long time. The food was amazing too. Definitely great place for families or large groups. Make sure to make your reservations! I booked the place online and everything went so smooth! I'll def revisit this place for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Quick drinks and excellent service. Always able to get a quick seating here.   Strong Manhattan's !"}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend and we started by sharing the calamari. It was the freshest, most well seasoned calamari I've ever had. The mango sauce it came with had such a pleasant note of heat to it. We both ordered linguini dishes; my boyfriend got the scallop and shrimp, and I got the prosciutto mushroom one. Both where extremely different taste wise, but both were prepared with fresh pasta noodles and came in very filling portion sizes. The pasta and the sauces were so so tasty.   The wait staff was also very friendly and helpful. They brought us wine to taste before we ordered to see which one we liked. Service was excellent.   Prices were decently high. The dishes cost 22 dollars each, and 6 oz. of wine was 11. 50 but I'm going to say it was definitely worth it.   The atmosphere is pretty minimalist, and the tables don't look too fancy but if you want an authentically delicious and filling meal, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Came here on a sat night with bf. Didn't have a reservation. Seated after two minutes.   The baguette served was warm.  We ordered one strip loin, one bowl of mushroom soup, and one daily special which was a BBQ back ribs.   Soup was fair. Bf liked his strip loin. I tried some of the mashed potato beneath and it tasted good.   However, my BBQ back ribs was a total disaster. It's more like a cancer causing all black piece of hard coal. (See pic) it tasted so strong... Sour... Spicy..... So as the corn on the cob. It's so burnt. I could finish the Coleslaw and the corn bread but not the corn nor the ribs. I wanted some additional Coleslaw to help with the spiciness but was told no.   For a total of $90+ for a meal that I didn't even want to finish..... I..... Don't think I'll visit again."}
{"text":"I love the Lamb Stew that is no longer on the menu (I'm very sad to find that out recently). Last time I was there (last weekend, I was craving Lamb Stew), I was so hungry that I didn't leave when I received the news about no Lamb Stew on the menu. I tried the Spring Roll Basket before I left disappointed because my fav dish is gone forever. The appetizer was really great and it had a kick to it, (spicy) for those who like it and can handle it. I usually can't handle it but it didn't do any harm to me. I will go back to try the new menu though. No pictures yet because I forgot about Yelp and now I have an iphone so I will use this site more often, if I remember LOL!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and like other reviews, this place isn't anything special but can be hit or miss.   Tonight particularly, we had a rather large group of 13 people and made reservations a week in advance. They refused to seat us until at least 8 people from our party had arrived.  Later when we had 7 people, they changed it to needing at least 10 people. WTH! It was weird because they had our table set up already the whole time, but made half our party wait outside standing for no apparent reason, including the birthday girl herself!  Boo.  Eventually when we sat down, our waiter was extremely friendly, personable, and attentive. Thank God something was going right.  Started off with cocktails. The Winter Sangria was delicious with a hint of cinnamon and apple slices. Yum.   Food wise, ate the Shrimp and Crab Cake entree as an appetizer (it's too small to be a real entrée size). That was delicious, although I didn't care for the slaw under it.   My main meal was the Seared Scallops on a bed of salad, chickpeas, etc. The scallops were okay, but I disliked the salad - it was really random and haphazard and bitter at times. It took away from the scallop, which was what I really wanted.  The reason why I'm writing this review though (after having dined here several times), is because I just found out not too long ago that both my friend and myself (who had the seared scallop entree) felt sick in our stomaches after when we got home.  Not cool. I don't know how anyone else in the party felt (probably okay), but just had to mention that.  The scallop didn't taste funny or anything, so it could've been the salad if it wasn't cleaned properly. Boo."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have come here if not for a gift card I got. I live in richmondhill so this was the closest restaurant that I could use the gift card. The food was not tasty and the variety of food has not changed in the past 15yrs (I am talking about lunch menu). I will not come again."}
{"text":"O&B staff are extremely efficient and courteous.  The food is out of this world, especially the churros and Sunday brunch.  It's a little pricey but great food and service."}
{"text":"There seems to be mixed review about this place so it could be a hit or miss.   I do have to say their brunch was delicious and I would not mind going again. I ordered the eggs Benedict, and it was pretty good. I still have yet to try their lunch/dinner menu so that could be a different experience but I would definitely recommend it for brunch.   However, my friend and I arrived on a late Sunday morning (11ish) and it was crowded! It could've been because of the Winterlicious crowd, which I completely forgot about but we were lucky enough to get seats since we were only a table of two. We were seated by the atrium, which has narrower pathways for people to walk through."}
{"text":"I love the salmon pizza here. Their pizzas are the best. I do not recommend the ravioli, too salty and tastes like frozen food you can buy at Loblaws. I also tried the mac n cheese which was underwhelming -- it tastes like Kraft dinner with goldfish crackers sprinkled on top."}
{"text":"A good brunch option if you want a slightly better atmosphere and service. The staff was friendly and usually very prompt with taking care of our group. I had the fried chicken french toast, which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken on a slice of thick french toast. The best part of the meal was the Grand Marnier maple syrup which comes in a little tin cup, it has an almost caramel flavor and adds something special to the dish.  Heads up if you are coming with a group and having cake for a celebration. There is a $2.50 cake cutting fee for each person in the group. They present the cake for you, cut it up and plate it for you. They even redistributed the cake decorations so each slice had some fruit and dusted some powder sugar on top, which was a nice touch. Also, for a group they add a 18% tip to your bill automatically."}
{"text":"My brother came back on the weekend from Hong Kong and wanted to \"eat anything but Chinese.\"  So we headed to O&B for brunch on Saturday morning.  Truth be told, we were expecting more selection.  My parents are very picky when it comes to food that isn't Asian, so they just decided to order a soup.  However, we sort of forced them to order a egg benedict, and they were satisfied (but I can tell they weren't overly happy).  My brother had the Montreal smoked deli, and I had the huevos rancheros.  I was very satisfied with my meal, but I think my brother was a bit disappointed after craving for a sandwich in Toronto.  It was an okay experience, but I was really expecting more diversity in terms of food at the restaurant."}
{"text":"The new O&B restaurant opened up about mid-June in 2010.  I remember walking by it quite often every time I was heading to the Distillery District or St. Lawrence.  I always wanted to go due to my great experience at the O&B located in Waterloo.  Not only this, walking past the gorgeous wrap-around patio with the Bay Street yuppies just made it seem more enticing.  I made an OpenTable reservation for 5:45 pm and was quickly escorted to a great seat for two for my friend and I.  As opposed to most of the other reviews on yelp, the service that we had was impeccable.  Our waitress always had a smile on her face and came by every so often to check up on us.  The décor of the restaurant was gorgeous and simple.  On the west side, they had the large patio for parties and functions.  There are tucked away booths, and apparently a loft-like dining room upstairs.  The restaurant was designed by Anacleto Design, who also worked on restaurants such as Jump and Bloom.  We started with two glasses of unoaked chardonnay from the Fielding Estate.  This is when I wish I had more knowledge in wine to fully appreciate it.  Who wants to go to a winery with me someday in the future? :]  We had the \"special appetizer of the day\" - poutine.  I thought this a sign sent from heaven considering that I was craving poutine (due to blogTO's \"The great Toronto Poutine Challenge).  The fries were apparently blanched three times throughout the day then fried.  It was topped with gravy (which was not too heavy), cheese curds, and to make it even extra special - bacon.  Needless to say, the poutine was excellent - a bit heavy to start off the meal, but I absolutely loved it.  My friend ordered the O&B Signature Thai Red Curry with chicken (however, I've neglected to ask him whether it was good or not).  I ordered myself the Strozzapreti with Rosemary Lamb Ragout.  I think I made a great choice - hand-rolled pasta with lamb and spinach in a very simple tomato sauce.  It was just the right size and portion (and considering that I had the poutine prior, I was still able to finish it).  It's a definite recommend.  Due to the fact that I had poutine and pasta (and bread beforehand), I was definitely full at the end of the meal.  I had no more space for dessert.  However, I noted that they had gelato from SOMA Chocolatemaker from the Distillery District.  Next time I come back to O&B, I am definitely getting myself a scoop or two of some delicious gelato!  Overall, great experience at O&B at Yonge & Front.  Great food, great atmosphere, great service, and great company!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each experience has been worse than the previous one. Some ingredients are clearly frozen and sometimes not even properly cooked. For the markup that you're paying, that's simply not acceptable."}
{"text":"Tonight went to Oliver & Bonacini with a friend for Winterlicious.   Ordered the split pea soup, tasted a bit sour compared to other restaurants that I've been too before.  The golden crispy chicken looked very delicious,  the first piece of chicken I had was very salty, drank the whole glass of ice water but didn't even help with the thirst.  But the second piece was very juicy.      I must say there carrot cake is very good !    Overall, the restaurant service was very polite, the food needs a bit of improvement especially for special events like Winterlicious."}
{"text":"Good food, competently prepared served by waitstaff that's well trained and friendly. The interior is not ugly and the bathrooms are fairly clean. I won't rush back, but I won't fight a return trip either.  Artichoke dip: meh, I've had better. They overdid the pepper flakes so it was hotter than expected. Skip this.  Butter chicken: It won't replace your favorite butter chicken, but it is well made and tasty.  Special: Med. rare strip loin w/ mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding. The pudding was salty, the mash was good and the strip loin was indeed medium rare and covered w/ a glaze/reduction. I didn't mind the lack of flavor since it was a needed counterpoint to the salty yorkshire pudding. The provided horse radish also gave it some added flavor.  I'd go to Bannock over this place, but if I'm in the neighborhood, this O&B resto isn't bad."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times and today I experienced the worst.  Got a table at the patio, nice vibe, ordered the wine special.  Got the mushroom soup fairly quick and it was as delicious as always.  Then 45 mins past for my main - the Sunday roast.  The beef was tough and cold.  Corn and mashed potato were lukewarm.  The bread was hard as rock.  The salmon tartare was salty and has tons of green onions.  The bill was $90 and I could have went to McDonald for $9 at least the Big Mac will be hot.  Also the table next to me waited for an hour with no food and they just left.  The waitress apologized but honestly for a well known chain restaurant in prime area how could this even happen.  The restaurant was not even full  I guess I won't be back......nobody as me even how dinner was so I just grab my bill and left!"}
{"text":"We came on a week night and had their \"Summerlicious\" menu.  It was $28 per person for a three course meal (appetizer, main + dessert).  The service was a bit slow but the waitress was very pleasant and attentive.  Meal was quite good (magnificent salad!).  Ambience is trendy and tables and restrooms were very clean.  We had a nice time."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and services. Lamb was chewy, pizza was soggy, fish was bland. Did I mention the atmosphere was like a fast food chain?  Actually I feel more cozy dining at other chain restaurants than this one. At least I will get better services and food. Will never return after giving them a third chance."}
{"text":"Just tried it again after about a year.  The restuarant is busy as ever, and it's very noisy because of that.  I would highly recommend going early or making reservations.  The menu has unique items, and even for common items, the make it a bit unique.  A good example are their burgers...they have a Lamb burger, a veggie burger, and a chicken burger.  I had the lamb burger.  It was unique...but it didn't make me yearn for more and I probably wouldn't order it again.  For $15, it was no bargain.  It was also a bit mushy, but since I don't have lamb burgers all the time, maybe that's the way it's supposed to be served.  Any toppings are $2 each...so your burger could get to $20 pretty quickly if you wanted bacon and mushrooms.  The lamb burger does come with Goat cheese (or was it feta?).  Service was decent considering how busy it was.  And our waiter was really nice and you could tell he took pride in his job.  That was nice to see.  All in all, it's a decent place.  Is it noisy?...yes.  Would you have to wait?...yes.  Is it pricey for what you get?...slightly.  It is unique enough to go out of your way?...no really.  You can't really go wrong going there, but it's not a special occaision either."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have been here. Happy that the food is still great! The 4 stars is mainly for our server Alex who was attentive and made our brunch very enjoyable. Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Boourns! My fiancée had eaten here on a few weeknights and generally had a good experience. We decided to try it out on a Friday night. Big mistake.  Even though the place was only half full, it took 20 minutes for someone to even take our order and we also had to ask a different waitress just to bring us some bread. When the food finally came, we were missing a side dish and our soup was only lukewarm. After 10 minutes when we were halfway through our mains we finally tracked down our waiter and told him. He apologized and said he would put a rush order on the missing side. 15 minutes later still no side, and a different waitress took our plates away. Another 20 minutes later our original waiter comes back, apologizes and asks if we still want the side - obviously not! We ask for the bill and he offers a free dessert but why would we wait around another 20 min for a dessert in an obviously unpleasant situation?? He talks to the manager and comes back with the bill, no comped food or drinks... geez, at the very least comp the appetizer?!   Needless to say this was a very disappointing experience, the waitstaff were inattentive and I will never go back, and I'm sure my fiancee won't be repeating his business there with his associates. It's too bad because their brunch menu looks really good and I was looking forward to trying it out on our next visit. For the prices we expected a lot more - you can get much nicer in Toronto for less. Oh, and the pasta was greasy.  Ordered: Mushroom soup Spinach salad Ricotta and porcini ravioli Side of garlic/lemon Rick shrimp Wine selection was decent"}
{"text":"Perhaps I came in from the office building entrance instead of the main entrance but when I entered, I was not greeted or escorted to a table so I seated myself. Sadly, the patio wasn't open so I sat inside. It also took a while before the waiter acknowledged my presence and offered me a menu.  They have a good selection on their menu but it's seriously overpriced... Yes the food is good but I don't think it's worthy of its high price tag. I ordered the albacore tuna which was really nice and light. My friend got the vegetable Samosa which was so so. It definitely was not a traditional samosa since the skin looked different. The atmosphere was nice and not too loud so I didn't have to strain to hear what my friend was saying.   Overall it's a great restaurant to go on a date or special occasions with friends but I personally found it too pricey for a regular hang out place."}
{"text":"Due to the fact that I'm not a fine dining type of guy. I will get straight to the point and provide a straight forward review.  First impression: The restaurant has a feel good vibe greeted with friendly and knowledgeable staff. It has a wonderful aroma coming out from the kitchen that can push your hunger from to starving.  Menu: They serve the normal western food with a side of fancy. They have a variety of choices but for some reason I've always opted to get the brunch specials.  The first time I was here, I got the chicken and waffle which I will not recommend. It was more like a wing or a nugget with waffles. For 16 bux, I had very high expectations. The chicken was a fail, it was bland and small. The waffles as I remember was good enough for me to consume.  Second time around was the chorizo sausage and potatoes. That was delicious! It had a nice kick and the ingredients was fresh! Potatoes were light and so well seasoned that I had wish that I have more. But that was it, I feel like they give you too little. I'm not asking for the world. All I want is the right amount to get me to satisfaction and get on with my day.  In terms of dessert, the carrot cake was the bomb! I won't describe how I felt you must try this for yourself.  Overall impression: it's a great restaurant, great food and service. However, it's not plenty and came out hungry. The price is a lot to go out of a restaurant still craving something. Good place for a nice date. But I would not recommend this for someone who wants to be full.  Final verdict. Try it once and find out if it's for you."}
{"text":"I know a lot of Yelpers like to return their food if it's not up to their exacting specifications, but I've never done that. For me, eating at a restaurant is like going to a movie or downloading an album: you're taking a gamble that the product is going to be good, and if it isn't, that's just too bad.  My meal at Oliver & Bonacini Café Grill made me wish I didn't have this policy.  We arrived around 11:30 on a Saturday and the place was mostly empty. Though the restaurant has plenty of brunch options, I was in the mood for a hamburger, so I went with the Smashed Ground Chuck Burger (\"housemade BBQ sauce, bacon, cheddar, iceberg lettuce, special sauce & Yukon Gold fries\").  It took a while for the food to arrive and, as I quickly discovered, it was not worth the wait. The toppings were all fine, but the patty itself? A complete and total disaster. First of all, it was cooked to almost well done. (I wasn't asked how I wanted it, but why is their default well done?) Far more problematic was the burger's dryness. It was a thick, dense patty devoid of any juiciness, so each mouthful was a struggle. This thing required more chewing power than a badly-cooked steak. I mean, it was atrocious.  My dining companion also got the burger and he had exactly the same experience that I did. I have to wonder if this is how they always cook/serve their hamburger or if the chef was just having an off morning? I'll never find out the answer because there's no way I'll return to Oliver & Bonacini Café Grill."}
{"text":"This had to be the best, and I mean best, eggs Benedict I have ever eaten!    We decided to go downtown Toronto with family visiting from New Brunswick after a night a catching up over a few drinks so we were a bit late for breakfast but found O & B served brunch.  They did not disappoint!   Everyone raved about their meals and it was the first time I had beer with eggs!   My cousins wife said they know how to make a Caesar, so I'll try on next time!  Great covered patio with friendly staff.   A bit pricey with a Limited menu but I think that is why everything is so good!"}
{"text":"After watching Master chef Canada and loving the judges, My husband and i decided to try restaurants owned by them..  We tried the salmon tartar maki , we weren't impressed at all. Salmon wasn't fresh and had a little fishy taste and the rice of the maki was really cold! I had the braised beef, it was okay and my husband tried the veal chops and loved it.. He also had the virgin caesar drink and loved it as well ..  Overall i was a underwhelmed with the taste of food as i was expecting so much!"}
{"text":"Winterlicious fail.. Came here with a group of four on a Sunday during lunch. As our water arrives the waiter spills a glass of coke all over the table and gets in on my jeans. So now I'm wet and sticky. After things get cleaned up it takes the other waiters a few trips to get us all of our cutleries back, however they missed a fork which I didn't find out until later. When placing the order the waiter kept asking us to speak louder, instead of leaning in or walking over to the person placing the order.  Drinks took a very long time to come. Second drink ordered arrived at the end of the meal. Barely any attention from wait staff. Overall I am unimpressed for a place as such. Wanted to box my untouched desert but at the end gave up in frustration as no wait staff came by for over 15 mins.  Food was fairly good as expected however the service was not impressive at all."}
{"text":"Love this place. I wouldn't have known this lovely restaurant if I wouldn't have gotten their gift card (my husband and I got it for our wedding) .   I've been in this specific location twice so far, and enjoyed every bite.  Meals are delicious and very generous. You won't leave this place hungry. I usually order an entrée and a main.  I've had the lamb gnocchi and an onion soup at the first time, a beet soup and Mac&cheese at the second time. Every thing was just super tasty. Both of the times I've had the phyllo wrapped cheesecake, and that was the best cheesecake I've ever had in a restaurant.  Beside the food, the restaurant has a very cool atmosphere and I love the industrial yet cozy feeling of the place. Also, it looks neat and feels clean.   Waitresses are very friendly and nice.  I would say that any occasion could be good to go there - anniversaries, birthdays even just after work or with colleagues."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during Summerlicious, $18 for the set meal.   I started with the Greens Salad, had the Lamb Bolognese as my main and then Cannoli for dessert.   Greens Salad - it was a salad, a bit hard to mess this up. It was good.   Lamb Bolognese - decent amount of lamb and pasta was cooked to my liking.   Cannoli - this was a orange ricotta cannoli with chocolate over top although it tasted more lemon-y in flavour to me   The interior was nice, service was prompt and we didn't have to wait long for our food. They came to check on us to make sure everything was okay and made sure our cups were filled."}
{"text":"Summerlicious chaos...we have made reservation and yet we have to wait for our table for more than 30 min.  The food was below par.  All the food were stone cold.  The mango puree on my fish cake was so dry up that i can't even taste it.  My dessert was the blackberry and lemon cake.  I can hardly taste the lemon and the blackberry and it was missing the whipped creme cheese.  I definitely expected more from this place.  It was a disappointing lunch overall."}
{"text":"Quality & Convenience.  Quality: The restaurant is beautiful. Upscale, open, trendy. The service is spot-on, attentive, & friendly. The food is excellent. I had a fresh artic chard appetizer & a lasagna that was borderline ridiculous with its amount of cheese. Ridiculous, being a good thing for me here.  Convenience: It's at the mall. You can't get any more convenient. No parking headaches here. It's also a lot closer to Milton than Toronto is.   I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I attended a brunch here yesterday. We came at 12:30 and it was very very busy!! Located in the ritzy area of Bayview village packed with elegant dressing women and enough Chanel bags to buy you a yacht.  I personally didn't think the place was anything great as the decor is okay and overall impression was that it just looked like a casual restaurant.  I ordered a mimosa and it was tasty but I think they could of done something a little better with the presentation other than just dropping a blueberry in it, but hey they were $5 a pop.  The real disappointment was when I ordered a Caesar salad and asked them to add chicken to it. It was underwhelming to say the least. It was very very small and although you can't tell from my photo take word for it and don't order it.  The dressing was odd as well.. watered down and tasted like it had blue cheese in it?? The chicken was dry. I mean, I wasn't trying to not to venture out that day so I figured I'd be safe and go with the Caesar salad because it insanely hard to mess up?!?  My friends liked they meals but they weren't raving over it. I gave this place 4* because the service was  impeccable! Our waiter was very attentive, always had a smile on his face and even joked a little here and their with us which made us feel nice and greatly welcomed.  The manager even dropped by a couple times to pour water and also waved us off when we left. Irregardless of this review I don't think they will suffer as I've never seen such a busy restaurant at that time in a very long time!  Not sure if I'd return though.."}
{"text":"The gff always bugs me to leave the house for brunch on weekends, and last weekend was no different. She selected the newish Oliver & Bonacini Café Grill, which serves brunch until 3 pm (on weekends only?)  This location is absolutely huge, with three separate glass-encased patios. The west patio offers a variety of seating options: banquette, high tables, bar, standard (?); and is laid out with plenty of room between tables. I can see this area getting rammed with post-work drinkers. The interior is stunning, has a lot of intimate booths, and the individual washrooms each have a Dyson hand dryer.   Our fantastic waitress was attentive, and recommended the Savoury Smoked Ham Crêpe. Gouda, mushrooms, and ham, wrapped in a crêpe, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise? Yes please. It was delicious, and I appreciated being able to consume hollandaise on something other than Eggs Benedict. My brunchmate did order the Eggs Benedict, and enjoyed them. We both prefer a hollandaise with more lemon, but she felt the spices dashed on top of the eggs, and the cheddar scone base (!) more than made up for it.  Free refills on coffee.  I'm disappointed to see the lackluster reviews on the dinner experience, but brunch was more than enough to get me back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I used to go to the location in Bayview village until I moved down here. It was always my favorite place to go. But I have been to this location twice now with bad experiences both times. The first time we had a hair in our appetizer and they took forever to bring a new one and still charged for it. This time no one was at the entrance to greet and once we were finally seated no one came to talk to us. We had to stop someone going by to ask them to take our order. The food was bland for the first time ever with weak serving size and presentation. We had to ask for bread and butter which they always brought right away in the past. And it was one sad bun cut in half for the two of us to share. The Oakville O&B has ruined the memory of my wonderful meals at the original one in north York."}
{"text":"I've been to this O&B twice now.  Once for dinner with a group of friends and once for lunch with co-workers.  With the co-workers, we were in the private room which is fantastic.  Food was great both times.  Atmosphere also amazing."}
{"text":"Never been to a place so unaccommodating. Service was terrible. Most restaurants would be let me see what we can do?  Our server says no it's not an option. We asked about kids menu. No kids menu. They said we have half portion for Mac and cheese and nothing else. I asked to change mashed potatoes to rice and also the answer I got was no sir that's not an option."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. Service was unattentive. Kept on having to look and wait for our server. We started off with mushroom soup $9. Great texture and flavourful. The seafood spaghetti was very bland. Noodles werr a bit overcooked and seafood portions extremely small. Need a microscope to find the scallops and I have fed larger shimps to my pet turtle. Also got the mushroom and pesto pizza with cottage cheese. Pizza was good but nothing great worth mentioning. Overall for the price point I was expecting more out of the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Why do I come here?  I think mainly because of convenience.  Food is mediocre at best and atmosphere is cool for girls brunch/gossip session...lol.  Honestly, it's a bit overpriced for the quality but there is plenty of parking, shopping and my bank is here.    This place would never be a place I would voluntarily want to come to but nor would I vehemently protest if the decision by others is to come.    Bring your wallet, low expectations, and empty starving stomach so that the food can taste just a little bit better."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch here was a little pricey but worth it.  My grandmother who is by far the pickiest eater alive polished off her omelette plate.  They also had $5 caesars which helped.  Got the O&B breaky and the wife got the eggs and lox.  Both plates were pretty good.  Eggs Benedict was also apparently good.  Home fries were fantastic but the sweet potato fries were nothing out of the ordinary.  All in all a pretty good Sunday brunch albeit a little pricey.   Paid $300+ for 9 people.  I did get charged  $30 service fee and left an additional $20 for our waitress."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for a work function during the week. They were very patient with us as we waited for the entire group to show up and we didn't feel rushed. They brought us some bread/butter which is always nice. We ordered a bunch of appetizers - I tried a spring roll which was fine. I ordered the shrimp and crab cake with no avocado because of a food intolerance. The waiter corrected me and said there was no avocado in that dish. I responded well it's on the menu. Sure enough, my dinner comes out with a large dollop of avocado. They replaced it quickly but the whole situation was a little irritating. The actual dinner was so small, it was basically just a shrimp and crab cake, with a tiny bit of coleslaw hidden under the cake . . . but nothing else. It was quite tasty especially the charred jalapeno sauce but I just wanted some more coleslaw perhaps? or anything?   Overall, I wouldn't return. High prices for small amount of food and lackluster service."}
{"text":"Ate here with fellow classmate Amy K (a Yelp Elite who got me into Yelping) as an end of the year celebration.  We ordered the fish tacos and spinach/artichoke dip for appetizers. Fish tacos were okay, dip was pretty standard.  I had the chef's special for main, a veal tenderloin wrapped in proscuttio served with gnocchi. The veal was pretty dry and the herbs they used made it kind of bitter. The gnocchi was alright.  Tbh, I think this place is a bit pricey for some of the types of food they serve. Amy had a super cheesy mac and cheese that should not cost more than $10..."}
{"text":"This review speaks to both their Lunch menu / experience as well as happy hour in the bar area of the restaurant.  I came to O&B Cafe Grill a couple of weeks ago with colleagues for lunch. I came in with an open mind - seeing as I'd never actually sampled their menu before.   Unfortunately, upon arrival - they didn't have our table ready. So we ended up sitting around a couple of smaller tables nearby for about 5 minutes while they set us up. Not a great start to the meal.  The menu selection was decent - however nothing in particular stood out. I had narrowed my choices down to a small handful: - Steak Frites - Japanese Chicken Caesar Salad, and the - Braised Beef Short Rib Gnocchi  Ultimately I went with the Steak Frites - being extremely hungry that day. Between my colleagues, they had gotten the Salad and the Gnocchi. Both looked like excellent choices - I wished I had gone with the Japanese Chicken Caesar Salad.  The steak was delicious - and grilled to a nice medium-rare. The fries were good too. I can't really find much else to say besides that haha.  I also ordered a cup of the O&B Mushroom Soup - made without cream or butter. It was really really good.  Unfortunately, with as much positive mentioned in the above post, I can't help but find the experience to be underwhelming overall. The menu items didn't stand out immensely and I would be hard to convince to come here under my own dime to have a meal.   ----------------------------------  As far as O&B goes for an after-work drinks occasion, I would put it at the middle of the pack for downtown Toronto (financial district)   The patio is nice, and looks out onto the busy corner of Yonge/Front - however it is always ridiculously busy. When you do manage to get a table, the service is hard to get a hold of. I must suggest that they increase coverage and get more waiters/waitresses to cover the tables."}
{"text":"Drinks okay. Service? *blows raspberry*  How is it that table service is better service here & I'm sitting at the bar right in front of you, BLATANTLY done with my food/drink & I can't get my bill in a timely fashion?!  I don't understand. Must be a thing...I'll keep it at that."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times, usually for brunch. It's a decent, but pricey upscale brunch place for those, who are looking for something not like Chez Cora's or Sunset Grill style. I have to admit that i love their Cottage fried potatoes out of everything that they offer.   I want to rate this place higher, but  this place is never consistant enough for me to rate it higher for the price that they do charge. The food, I find, can be underwhelming, either from under seasoning or from the general way they do the cooking. Overall, the food isn't always great-tasting. The service is mostly attentive, but occassionally forgetful, when it gets busy; which is understandable.   If you are coming here for brunch, please make sure you make reservations ahead of time, otherwise you're looking at an hour wait at peak time. There is a max limit of people in your party for reservations; which i believe to be around 12 people or so."}
{"text":"The good: they have a good selection for brunch.. But...  The bad: small small small portions. Didn't taste as good as the menu would look. There are way better brunch places out there. It's probably a good one to go to if you are uptown area but definitely cannot compare to the ones downtown.  Eggs Benedict: it was alright, but nothing amazing or out of the ordinary  Spinach and feta shakshuka: looks better than it taste. Overloaded in tomato sauce, couldn't stomach it after the third bite.  The ugly: wait times can be super long during weekend brunch hours. Be prepared to wait.  Neutral: great atmosphere, good service, and great for groups."}
{"text":"Went to O&B with a large party to try their summerlicious 2015 menu. Normally, this restaurant would be a three, but Derek** earned it that extra star!   Great: Veggie pakora was a fried felafel, but still delicious, clam chowder was fantastic   Good: the haddock on rice was good, but not memorable (huge portion)...as was the schnitzel and the cheese plate was good, but the cheese they were serving was a very safe (I like weird cheese). The beaver tail was just OK.   Thumbs down: the peach and apple pie (like a sad strudel).   Alcohol!!!! the peach margarita was good (albeit not very strong) and their jalapeño margarita was a nice twist on a classic and not too sweet.   **What made my experience was the waiter we had (Derek?). He was very attentive and very accommodating with all of our requests. If we had even the slightest issue with anything that was served he would quickly remedy the situation without batting an eye. For example, one of the peach margaritas we had was very very salty (the salted rim fell into the drink) and my entire table of six proceeded to try it to see if it was the drink or the person, but as a result, most of the drink was gone. Our waiter was very nice and he said that it had happened before and brought us another drink without a salted rim, no questions asked. He was very bright and helpful with suggesting different entrees and drinks, and always made us feel like we could ask for anything and he would do his best to accommodate us (which - unfortunately for him - actually ended up happening with quite a few other tables who continuously asked to be moved)."}
{"text":"I was here on both Summerlicious and non-Summerlicious occasions and I find their food A-OK...literally.  I sat in tonight for a dinner and was taken to their \"patio\" area, which is fine.  However, the poor waitress was serving ALL the tables, along the whole patio area, causing things to come out extremely slow, out of sequence, and out of order.  It took forever for her to take our dessert orders and forever to get the bill.  I also heard two tables across from me complain about their food and the service as well.    Albeit the waitress being very green, she was pleasant for the most part.  I did not feel that it was her fault for not being able to man all the tables along the patio area because it was a very big section for her to be doing alone.  At one point, the hostess' were coming out to pour water, etc.  I just really hope that their short-staffing issue isn't a week long issue and that maybe it was just a bad night tonight.    As for my food...it could have been better.  My burger was way too overcooked and the cheese they had on the burger overpowered the flavour of my meat.  Their arugula salad was delicious though, I must say.    O & B used to be one of my favourite childhood restaurants but its brunch is still very good.  However, dinner has really declined.  Again, I really hope their short-staffing issue gets resolved...and hopefully, there will be better service on their end!"}
{"text":"Mm it's actually my 3rd time here but my first time trying the lunch summerlicious. I've had the summerlicious dinner a couple years back and I recall that being tastier.  Came another time for the regular menu and taste was also better. I feel like the meals were all premade this time. I ordered the chicken and it was sooooo dry I couldn't finish it. The only good thing was the dessert which was the brownie with ice cream..."}
{"text":"So I finally tried my first Oliver and Bonacini-related restaurant.  Went to this one for Summerlicious 2016 after hearing so much about high quality Italian food from this brand, and decided to give this place a try. Good thing I reserved ahead of time, because there was quite a lineup here at 6pm on a Saturday.  I went with the chilled tuscan melon gazpacho, simmered beef short rib, and fudge brownie. Overall everything I had was decent, and if this was a single person experience (or if everyone in my party ordered the same items), I would up it to 3.5 or 4 stars. However there were different variations, and some items were not to our expectations.  Everyone in my party except me ordered the skin roasted sea bream. However, the four sea bream dishes all had four completely different sizes, and only one ended up being properly roasted. It tasted okay regardless...but since it was advertised as roasted the three recipients weren't very impressed with their main course.  Service was not very good, especially considering we had different servers serving us each time. Normally in these establishments there should've been one dedicated server doing at least the ordering, pouring drinks, and making sure everything's okay...but it wasn't the case that night. We also had to go thru three servers to get more bread (which, by the way, tasted delicious).  My first impression overall wasn't great, but it might have been the 'licious factor. Perhaps a second try outside the 'licious events is in order."}
{"text":"I've been to this O&B 3 times now. I have mixed reviews overall. The food is good, but you pay for it so nothing to be too excited for. Pricing is very comparable to Ki or Jump though, maybe even a bit less expensive.  The location and decor are very nice. The patio is beautiful and one of the top for core downtown Toronto.  The staff are generally friendly although one of the hostesses we encountered was a bit snotty - maybe she had just come back from working in Paris?  Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars based on the night."}
{"text":"Definitely not the place you want to eat. This is my weekend bar, just for drinks!"}
{"text":"Prices are simular to going to milestones however the food is more sophisticated."}
{"text":"Came here for a regular dinner and once for Summerlicious lunch. I found that the Summerlicious menu was better than the dinner I had. For lunch I had ordered a fish dish which was flavourful. For dinner, I had ordered the bouillabaisse, which was decent but most of the mussels were closed.  The service was great, friendly staff, and they were able to accommodate separate bills for a table of 12 or so. Unfortunately, I don't think I'd return on a regular day for a meal because the food quality just isn't worth the price you pay for it. The other people at my table for dinner felt the same way. Although the service was great, the food needs some improvement."}
{"text":"After winning a gift card from O&B we decided to try one of their more affordable restaurants. We arrived around 7 pm. I was glad there wasn't a wait. Apparently there was only one table left in the lounge.  Service throughout our stay was not good. The majority of the time was spent waiting for the server/bartender. We waited a while to get acknowledged, waited a bit to receive our water, and waited some more for our bill.   Nothing on the menu really popped out or sounded interesting. He got the butter chicken and I got the shrimp in pesto linguine. My linguine was underwhelming and plain tasting. The butter chicken tasted way better and authentic.   I'm glad we had a gift card because it was definitely not worth almost $50 for the slow service and boring pasta. First and last time here."}
{"text":"grabbed brunch here after passing on the disaster that is the sunday brunch rush at Hot house... great service, no wait and a very decent eggs benny... a little pricey for brunch but well worth it for not having to deal with the head aches of the more popular brunch venues..."}
{"text":"Restaurant is large, comfortable and conveniently located downtown. My fiance has celiac disease, so we go here quite often as they have a good GF selection for him and his family.  Generally the service is really good, but there was once when it wasn't. The server was running around and wasn't able to focus on our table."}
{"text":"We were there last Friday, every one enjoyed food, just didn't get the seats we want."}
{"text":"O&B is always great, which is why I decided to have a birthday brunch with my girlfriends. It was no problem accommodating a large party, and the waiter was very attentive. No one had any complaints on their dishes, which were all quite yummy, and the drinks were good too. Overall we had a great time. The only thing is that when we requested separate bills we got some attitude. It would have been better to just tell us no than to make us feel bad for asking. In the end they did it, but begrudgingly."}
{"text":"Nice presentation but a bit overpriced for the quality of taste. First there's no signature dish. They seem to just do an adequate job with their dishes. Nothing special. Their main attraction is perhaps the Sunday brunch but that's because they're the only real offering in this neighbourhood. Plus it's just eggs and again nothing special.  So I give the place three stars.  Also service sucks."}
{"text":"I ventured in with high hopes, after checking out their Summerlicious menu because it is an Oliver & Bonacini restaurant. What a big mistake!  My friend and I ordered the perogies and Papaya salad as our apps. They were pretty good. We ordered the Jambalaya- it was the driest and most flavourless I ever tasted. The fish was fried in hard, heavy batter i could barely taste the fish. My friend is Hungarian so not sure it's a fair critique about the schnitzel- she said she's had better. For dessert she ordered cheese and crackers which she loved, and I ordered a microwave- heated peach pie."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food x10. I came to eat here because we were watching a performance across the street. We ordered the cream mushroom fettuccine with truffle and the lamb shoulder gnocchi in tomato sauce. I ordered the truffle pasta because I recently had it at another restaurant and it was so delicious I was craving it again. This dish however fell so short that it brought me great sadness. It tasted like a blander, overly peppered alfredo sauce. Could not taste the truffle at all. As for the gnocchi, the dish smelled so strongly of wine in an unpleasant way. Rather than a desirable subtle hint, it hits your nose with a bang. Taste wise all you can taste is a burst of red wine which would then taper off to tomato after.   The portion sizes for both was small and sad looking. Not much lamb pieces too. So yes, I'd give this place a zero because I was that disappointed. However, my server was excellent. She was mindful that we were eating a rushed dinner and told me exactly when to order. She was courteous and personable too!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. The servers kept serving the wrong table. Wait time for food was ridiculous when a simple entreé was ordered. The hype for this place is way overrated for the brand value they carry. Their value proposition is not something that I would say makes sense because it was only one server who was running the show out there. They had some good specials with their burger meals but we opted for the salad. Luckily we had a gift card, will not be going there again till they introduce more variety and trained staff."}
{"text":"I was looking for a decent place to eat dinner with my friends and I thought of Oliver and Bonacini Cafe & Grill right away. I've always wanted to try this restaurant because I've been to all the other O&B restaurants (except Biff's).  I liked the ambiance and decorations of this restaurant. It's very nice, clean and the noise level was decent.  The first dish we got was the melting artichoke, chickpea and parmesan dip ($15.50) with assorted pitas, flatbreads and corn chips which we shared between four people. I loved the flatbread because it has a pocket for the dip and I thought it was very cute. You can definitely taste the chickpea for this dish.  My friend got a smoked chicken and mushroom pizza ($15.95) with fontina cheese, parmigiano-reggiano and arugula. He really enjoyed his dish and I think it was a good portion (since he didn't complain about being hungry after finishing his meal).  My other friend got a burger (don't remember which one) but he also enjoyed it and it was a nice portion.  My last friend got a ricotta and porcini ravioli ($17.95) with green asparagus, chili, lemon, thyme and extra virgin olive oil. I got a chance to try her dish and it was delicious (I liked it more than my pasta dish).  I got the fettucine alla carbonara ($15.25) which I enjoyed. I usually don't like carbonara because the sauce tastes weird but I enjoyed it at this restaurant. My only complaint is that some of the pasta was stuck together and wasn't properly cooked. The portion was decent (I was overly full after dinner).  I saw the cornbread pudding ($4.95) and I couldn't help but order it to see how it looks like. It turns out to be more like a muffin than a pudding. My friend thought it was a bit dry (which I agree) but I don't think it was appalling dry. The butter on top had a weird taste to it. I wouldn't recommend the cornbread pudding, instead save your money for dessert.  This restaurant didn't disappoint nor wowed me which is totally fine because I don't expect all restaurants to be outstanding. I would come back here for the ambiance, good service and decent food."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday evening with my boss, his wife, and my partner for some drinks and eats.  We stayed for about 3 hours ordering and then reordering appetizers and cocktails.  Best cucumber sangria ever!  Loved the duck tacos....except they used store bought tortillas instead of making their own which was disappointing. Chicken & Leek pot-stickers were enjoyable.  The goat cheese and artichoke spinach dip  was heavenly and the spring rolls were divine.  It was a chaotic enjoyable visit with a great patio.  The service was adequate but not over the top....the only drawback was that it was a Saturday night and they were slammed....so getting a cheque was like pulling teeth."}
{"text":"Nice fancy place to have a meal without breaking the bank. I've come here several times and it's be consistently a pleasant experience. The atmosphere and ambiance are great for conversation and seating is very comfortable. The food is excellent. The seared tuna was really delicious (I'm sad I didn't take a picture of it! Yelping 101 fail). I would definitely come back.  Great place to come with friends, a date, or family."}
{"text":"I have been here on two occasions, once for after-work drinks on the patio and once for lunch indoors. The service has always been pleasant.  The patio here is nice and spacious and we had ordered a bunch of drinks, appetizers and mains. I do agree with other yelpers that the prices are a little on the pricey side and the portions definitely do not reflect the high price.  The lunch menu includes some items that are reasonably priced and very delicious! I ordered the roast beef panini with a side of sweet potato fries and it was delicious! The sandwich portions are very reasonable for the price ($16 to $17) and come with a side of fries/sweet potato fries. The salads however, did not seem as good of a deal as they were priced anywhere from $21 to $24 and did not have much greens."}
{"text":"Had a great day in the city and was ending off the evening with a bite to eat near union station. Had very high expectations for an O & B resto, but have to say was disappointed overall after our visit.   Calamari, although tasty, was unappealing to look at, seems like they rushed through the breading process and tossed it on the plate. This led to a lot of the breading falling off etc.   I got the butter chicken, which was recommended.. the dish was not terrible, just very bland. Not something I would tell a customer who is looking for the best dish.   Mushroom fettuccine, was above average, but hit and miss with the truffle from plate to plate - inconsistent.   Fish and chips were solid, again, breading was falling off the fish, but the taste was there.   The house red was great and the service, besides recommendations was very nice and pleasant.   Not a bad evening, but having the O&B tag on your restaurant I just expect more finesse and execution.   Cheers."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is really right for this place Maybe it was just an off night but I was very unimpressed  It was a Saturday night and I had a reservation When we arrived, we still had to wait (about 15-20 minutes) and they were taking other people before us, which was frustrating (why take a reservation if I have to just wait anyway???)  Our server was kinda out of it and not very knowledgable - when I asked if one of the dips was made was milk or cream, she told me about a salad (what?!) and when I asked again about the dip, she said that it's good for sharing (which wasn't my question) and that it's made with cheese (also not my question)  It took awhile to get our food; the table beside us was complaining because we got our food before them and we ordered after The server came by once to let us know the food was delayed but didn't offer anything   The food was underwhelming Shared a salad (the goat cheese one I believe) - wasn't much in there Had a pizza and the moroccan lamb  The food was all something I could make at home (pretty simple, not a large portion)  The price was also high for the service and food you're getting  If you're at Bayview Village, I'd say check out Il Fornello instead"}
{"text":"Fish and chips is usually a safe bet in Toronto.  Not here.  Looked ok when it arrived but then quickly became soggy.  So did the fries.  No idea why that happened.  Were they frozen and then fried too wet?  And the tablespoon of accompanying coleslaw wasn't very good.  While the servers tried to be friendly, I noted that my water glass remained empty; they didn't check and didn't refill.  I just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about. Went for brunch. The booths are tiny and very uncomfortable.  I had eggs Benedict, a brunch staple.  The best part of this were the eggs, poached perfectly. However the hollandaise was flavourless, the scones fell apart into a crumbly mess, and the ham (didnt use Peameal) was rock hard, like it had been left out overnight.  The 5 potato quarters on the side of the plate looked burnt in colour, but turned out they were just seriously over spiced (and cold). Tiny portion for such a price.  The people I was with didn't fare much better.  The BLT with an egg on top was the highlight of the table, as far as food goes. Service was slow, although very friendly when they did stop by. We won't be back, tons of better brunch spots in TO."}
{"text":"We came here for summerlicious and were about 15 minutes late for our reservation. The place was absolutely packed but they still accommodated us within about 10 minutes.  I got the greens salad, penne pasta, and chocolate cake, all of which I absolutely love. The salad was delicious and I actually was left craving more. The pasta sauce was very flavourful and the pasta was cooked just right. And the cake was delightful; such a perfect end to a delicious meal.   I would definitely come here again if it weren't so far from home."}
{"text":"Ever since Sierra Grill closed, I've been coming here when guests visit from out of town. It's a safe bet and I always arrive before it gets busy; I probably won't ever arrive here after 6pm because the noise becomes deafening. I like the cocktail specials on Sunday night!  I've never had terrible food here, but most of it seems prepared to please the masses; it's not a culinary adventure. That's okay though; sometimes you need something safe and reliable. Unfortunately, the prices are reliably high; pricing probably reflects the massive size of the property and I'm sure paying rent in Bayview Village isn't cheap."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times over the years. Our experience has been degrading over time. The last time we went was just recently, December 24th to be exact. The quality of their food has gone down that I would challenge Oliver or Bonacini to eat what their chef has prepared. The steak that I ordered medium was so rough that it wouldn't even pass as well-done. The tuna salad that my wife got was also something that looks like you would get from a food court. Seriously, the owners need to visit this place as it's a disgrace to their reputation."}
{"text":"We decided to try Oliver&Bonacini on a whim when we saw it in Bayview Village. We were immediately seated in a booth. The dim lighting and candlelit tables gave the place a really great ambience.   We got the 10oz BBQ strip loin ($37), which was served with some vegetables and potatoes. The meat itself was cooked to perfection, tender and savory, and the sides topped it off very well--I definitely recommend it.   We also got the Mac & Cheese Pasta ($16), which looked very childish. On the menu, it said it would be served with Goldfish crumbs but it was actually served with entire Goldfish crackers. The taste itself was a bit bland after a few bites as well; not worth the money."}
{"text":"I have been here at this location a few times before and the food was great. The veal gnocci was my favorite along with the seafood Linguine. However the last few times I've been there, The quality of the food has been well below expectations. They updated the menu and I can say it's been very successful in adding new and exciting dishes. As everyone else said the atmosphere and the ambiance is contemporary and the staff service is exceptional, I just wish they had the food to match it. My advice to O&B, Get rid of the Moroccan Tajine with apricots and and stick to the classics, please bring back the seafood linguine and Braised feel gnocchi."}
{"text":"Went to O&B for Mothers Day Brunch on May 14, 2017.  Unfortunately the food was  extremely salty and 5 out of 8 people within my party were very disappointed with the food and would never go back.  Service was good, but can't say the same for the over-salted food.  I read other reviews and heard from others who expressed the same concern. I expected more from this resturant and surprised the chef does not taste the food which was very obviously too salty."}
{"text":"It's not the same anymore. Low quality food and service was very bad. Bread cake after we finished our dinner. Caesar was watery, mule has no flavour, grilled calamari rubbery, buttery and mushroom fettuccine had no flavour.   Will never go back to this restaurant. OB is all diluted now"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Oliver & Bonacini Café Grill, which is in Oakville Place.  I ordered Butter Chicken.  It's been a while since I've had butter chicken.  This was good.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was good.  The raita was refreshing.  I used the naan to dip in the leftover sauce.  I'd get this again.  Rebecca was my server and she took good care of me."}
{"text":"Three friends and I recently ate at Oliver & Bonacini Café Grill ... it opened in June and is where Shopsy's used to be.  It's a really nice restaurant, done in black and white. The staff is exceptionally friendly. Our server, Chad, was great and very attentive.  I had the beer battered Atlantic haddock and Yukon fries. It was delicious ... the batter wasn't too much. My friends enjoyed their meals too.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food at a pretty reasonable price.  The waiters and waitresses are very pleasant and the ambience is very inviting."}
{"text":"Following upon my recent review of OLIVER & BONACINI CAFE GRILL, I received a phone call from the \"managaress \" of this establishment. She apologised for the COCKROACH presence and said she would be instituting pest control. She offered a voucher which she said I could use for a meal at any of OLIVER & BONACINI'S branches. I declined this offer, stating that on no account would I care to eat at any of their establishments, in view of my recent experience.  I suggested that she give the equivalent of what I had spent on the COCKROACH visit to the church.( $183.76 )  My wife gave her the name of the church for the check and our address in order to mail the check.  The \"managaress  \" said she would have to ask the owner to authorise this and that she would email me in that connection.  It has been several days since the phone call. Thus far no email and no check....ONE STAR is too much..."}
{"text":"5 stars! Fantastic experience from start to finish! Booked on Open Table and actually arrived 30 mins early. They were able to accommodate us right away. It was VERY busy on their patio and moderately busy in the dining room. Definitely filled up as the night went on. It was a tiny bit loud in the dining room, but was kind of expected.   The gentleman we had for a server (tall, dark guy and dont see his name on the receipt) was very good, and quick to refill water and wine. Ordered a great Viognier from the wine list, and it was ice cold. We had the Goat Cheese Spinach Dip thing, and it was great! A bit spicy, which was a great surprise.  Friends at the table had the Calamari dinner, which she said was outstanding. She is from BC too, so pretty used to seafood and really enjoyed! Other friend had the Egg Carbonara fettuccine, which she also loved. She is Italian, and knows a thing or two about pasta! haha ;)  I had the New York Strip with bacon marmalade, and it was soooo good. The bacon jam was a great mix with the beef, which was cooked perfectly. It was a great hunk of meat, on top a hefty pillow of mashed potatoes and veggies. The mashed potatoes were soooo creamy. Very tasty indeed!  I am not a dessert person at all, but the apple and blueberry crumble called my name...and i responded by EATING IT ALLLLLL. Loved the presentation on the long plate with a brush of custard.  Accepts Amex, wooooo! Definitely recommend, and will definitely return! Apparently they have $2 parking? I didnt know this until after! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Arrived 15 minutes earlier than reservation, and I wouldn't say it was the warmest welcome. Didn't even get a \"hallo\" or \"welcome to....\". Feel more like checking into a lawyer's office than to a classy restaurant.  Our server, Amanda, on the other hand, was really friendly, and made good suggestions. Their food were cooked to perfection. Thanks to the Prix Fixe menu for New Year's Eve, the price was really reasonable. If not for the cold welcome, I would've given five stars."}
{"text":"We've been coming every month to O&B for brunch. However the service has gone completely down hill and we will now be moving to a new place. We were the first people in the restaurant in the morning. 1:45 later we were still waiting for our bills. The waiters regularly ignored us trying to signal them down. They brought coffee and tea and then took 15 min to bring milk. Perhaps it's a new system but the waiters seems to spend more time staring at their screens than actually talking to clients. A very frustrating experience and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 4/5! Service was amazing and food was pretty good. However we were seated outside of the restaurant and it was quite chilly every time the main doors opened.   We tried the Winterlicious menu for lunch and were pretty pleased with our selections. We also had $5 mimosas since it was part of the Saturday drink specials. Out of everything I tried, I would recommend the Spicy Meatballs, Honey Glazed Salmon and the Baba Aubhum if you're stopping by here for Winterlicious!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this restaurant half a dozen times over the last few years and food has dramatically improved. I have been there twice in a week. The samosas are the best I've had. The pork in sticky buns on the other hand was way to dry. Overall a good great value meal."}
{"text":"3/5 Honestly, this place imho is very overrated. Food wise, the portions are decent but the taste has always been quite bland. The only good thing is the  ambiance. They are also very lucky as it is situated inside Bayview Village where people have lots of money to burn.   I ordered the Chicken Pesto Fusili for lunch $16. It was ok but the basil nor garlic didn't seem too strong. Kind of like it was 'watered down' w/ something. Not sure. I had a decent amount of chicken & veggies w/ it. The chicken was nice and tender. My friend ordered a Mac & Cheese $16 for lunch. The portion seemed small. Perhaps this was meant for a child. I felt it needed more cheddar cheese, cream, and more breadcrumbs. Very bland.  I have been here at least on 3 different occasions. The service has always been top notch. The wait staff were all very courteous and nice.  Great for groups though. After lunch, it's also nice to walk around the mall."}
{"text":"Okay experience. Ordered a mixed green salad (boring) calamari (nicely cooked but missing a bit of flavour) fish tacos (pretty tasty and juicy) bacon cheeseburger (great to share. Fries are nice and thick too).  Overall an okay experience."}
{"text":"Your typical chain experience. Good and predictable but not mind blowing."}
{"text":"I came here with friends after work.   My ahi tuna burger was a huge disappointment. I was psyched to have the Monday special of fried chicken and waffles - again so disappointing that they're menu is changing & it was not available.   The service was mediocre as well - the waiter barely elaborated and was so laissez faire about the change in the daily specials.   Mediocre food with mediocre service."}
{"text":"I went there last night for a winterlicious dinner thinking that i'd be impressed but i ended up to be terribly disappointed. I've been to O and B for a regular night's dinner before and it was not bad. But last night was bad. My server was a little weird and overly friendly because he kept making lame jokes on my family's conversation which he obviously didn't understand as he didn't speak the language.  For appetizer, i had  a dinky piece of salmon and watercress plus a few pieces of hard discs of bread. For main, i was surprised to be served a bowl of curry rice. Honestly, why do they serve indian food there? If i wanted indian food, i would go to an indian restaurant. Anyways, since i'm not a fan of indian food, I obviously didn't enjoy my main even though it wasn't horrible tasting. The dessert was an apple crumble which was obviously bought frozen and reheated to serve.   What i was served last night should definitely not be from an \"up scale\" restaurant.  NOT IMPRESSED."}
{"text":"We had the summerlicious lunch. I didn't really like my main course. It was a seafood  kind of a broth. But the veal sandwich from my friend was delicious! The salad and dessert was ok. Service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions and had the Piri Piri Chicken and the Braised Beef Short Rib.  Both were excellent and I would highly recommend them.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  I'll definetly be back."}
{"text":"Before I can tell you my perspective of what I didn't care for at this location, I have to emphasize that the staff were very pleasant.  So much so that they gave my best friend a congratulations card on his celebratory achievement. Unfortunately that was the only thing about this place that gets a 5/5 rating. I was fairly disappointed in this restaurant. First I think my expectations were quite high, seeing that Oliver and Bonnacini's is in the Bayview Village. I was under the impression that because of its location, it has higher end quality, in fact it almost fell short of just average.   The atmosphere is quite pleasant and the staff work hard, like I said, and there's no doubt about that. That in itself is a very positive bonus. What concerned me was were the following things.  The decor. It's quite nice in many regards, a nice layout of wine is displayed on a wall, you can see the open wood oven where pizza is made, it's dimly and romantically lit, but they have cafeteria like tables. These tables were wobbly, not set right and wiggled too and fro while I attempted to cut up my food and it was not pleasant. I had to either get a napkin and fold it in half under a leg of the table or place my foot under the leg to stabilize it. I chose the latter, to my dismay.   The portions are very small, and overpriced.  The food was average. Dinner was acceptable although my fish was very very dry. Dessert, which is a hot lava cake, was delivered cold.  Drinks. They forgot to get my wife hers, and only brought it after being reminded twice.   Overall. Not great. Won't recommend it and won't go back. Friendly staff unfortunately don't trump poor tables, lack of service and subpar food, that is overpriced."}
{"text":"With the growing trend of brunching on the weekends in Toronto, finding an ideal spot can be tough. Some are trendy with terrible service. Some are tried and true yet the food is horrible.  O&B Front Street gets it right on all fronts. Atmosphere: perfect. The place is huge - whether patio, terrace or indoors you'll have enough room for a large gathering of friends. Or keep it intimate for two with a booth or table. Tastefully decorated - posh and chic.  The food: amazing. I've been twice - and both times I've ordered the stuffed brioche French toast. It's stuffed with goat cheese (yes!!) with a hint of orange infused maple syrup and topped with plums.  Service: top notch. Don't know why the rest of you are complaining. Twice now I've had excellent service. Friendly, knowledgable and fast.  Check it out, brunch snobs. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a saturday morning. Place is very dim on the morning which is what you want for breakfast. Had the scotch egg avocado and shakshuka, both were ok. Shakshuka was a bit underwhelming, missing some spices in my opinion. The avocado scotch egg was very interesting, but lacked salt for me.! Fresh juice is available at this place. Service was good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Once for so-called brunch and once for dinner. Overall impressions: the staff is clueless and the kitchen overtaxed and confused. They are barely veg friendly and I guess the clientele doesn't warrant it. Overpriced and too noisy. When I went for dinner, I ordered the only veg option and was surprised that the tofu was covered in melted cheese. To me, this makes no sense. The dish itself was barely passable. When I mentioned the tofu issue to the server ( who seemed to have done one too many lines in the john on his break), he looked at me like I had peed at the table and mumbled something about the chef knowing his stuff.....I think not! He offered a free gelato which he said was vegan which I declined. I guess he tried and perhaps I was wrong to mention that tofu is not served with cheese. Needless to say, I will never return. Very mediocre food, bad value, odd service."}
{"text":"If able to rate this a ZERO stars I would have, NEVER BOTHER, located across the street from Ali Wong's performance (Sony Centre) was the reason we chose this location, don't make the same mistake."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5. Came here on a Saturday morning at 11am (opens at 11) with one of my favourite people. The 2 of us were seated right away (we made a reservation online). Drink orders were taken promptly and the service was very friendly.   I ordered the shrimp frittata ($17) that was made with spinach, brown rice noodles and julienned root vegetables. The presentation was very pretty but it was a little tough to eat the crunchy noodles on top. The flavours didn't totally jive with me but it was \"ok\" and was served nice and hot. My friend ordered an orange juice ($4), the quiche ($16) which also came with a side salad. We would rate the food around a 3 to 3.5 considering the prices as well but understanding it is located in bayview village which is higher end.   Great and fast service and nice ambience. We were actually done our brunch a little after 12 and were able to walk around the mall for a while which was nice. But we didn't feel rushed.   I have been here for brunch a few times now and have never been wowed. But it is a convenient location to meet up with friends and nice staff.   I'd actually really like to try the origins north that is just next door!"}
{"text":"Overpriced wine (a $9 bottle in the LCBO is $48, an $18 bottle is nearly $80, etc) and overpriced food. For dinner the meals were ok, but nothing special...largely bland and basic, yet $30 per person. There are much better places to check out downtown. If it wasn't for the financial district crowd meeting here for drinks on Wed and Thurs nights, this place would be in trouble....this is evidenced by how quiet it is on weekends."}
{"text":"Came in with a girlfriend for a meal.  The environment not bad but hard to hear to many people talking with the music.  The waiter was very nice looking and knew his stuff. I tryed a Christmas special drinks it was the fruit juice it was not worth six dollars even I was good. The glass was too small for me.    The food was very good and hot.  We both had the fish 2 fish.    Would I return sure perhaps for a Earlyer meal not one at 9pm as we arrived."}
{"text":"We've been to O&B twice.   The service is excellent, the recipes are great, but the actual food execution is poor. When we attended brunch, we had scones with raw dough inside. Kinda unpleasant, but no big deal. Certain things, like the soup of the day (a pumpkin soup) were excellent, but others were only average.  We returned again for dinner and low and behold, more undercooked food. This time it was roasted salmon that actually came out cold on the inside (like actually cold!) on one side. I love raw salmon but only when its sushi grade and not when its mostly/supposed to be cooked... Didn't get sick but cold/raw food is unacceptable. Not really acceptable.   Would be 1 star if it wasn't for the service and atmosphere which are excellent. Overpriced for the poor food quality."}
{"text":"boring food. service drops like a stone when it gets even a little busier. i'd never ever come if it wasn't on the bank's tab. i'd rather eat snot than their oysters. not fresh."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner before a sold out show at the ACC.  We had reservations and were seated immediately.  Staff were very friendly throughout and I have no issues with anything they did which is rare.   It was nice to see local wines dominating the wine lists.  We ordered a bottle of Cab and Pinot Grigio for the table which were both excellent though I can't remember the names.  The bread provided was  well received.  I got the salmon entree which was excellent.  Fish and chips looked good as did all the other entrees on the table.  We stayed a while and though the restaurant was crowded we were not rushed in the slightest.  We were often served by multiple people at once despite the crowd.  I really enjoyed the restaurant but would definitely like a hearty near dish or 2 to be added to the menu.  I would return and recommend to a friend.  The ambiance and atmosphere were awesome."}
{"text":"6 of us went yesterday to try it out.  I've been to the ob in bayview village but this location is the first.  The server we had thinks he had a good memory or what everyone ordered and tries not the write it down.  But he actual got it all mixed up.  But good try.  I ordered the lamb sirloin and it tasted sweet.  Doesn't suit my palate.  The wine selection is very average and new world.  The som could do better and offer a few selection that are more unique and non generic"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill over the last 2 years. Went for dinner last night to celebrate an early Easter. 5 of us in total, 3 ordered the special (jerked ribs) and 2 of us ordered pasta. Some notes:  - our dinner came out in about 8 minutes (before our wine even came out)... The ribs were good but the pasta was very undercooked. It was clear they rushed the pasta to match the ribs. They should have just waited the extra 10 minutes to let the pasta cook properly.  - my fettuccini bolognese came out drenched in parmesan cheese. Even the waiter noticed and tried to play it off like it was normal.  - the markup on wine was the highest I've ever seen at a restaurant. There's a Graffinga on the menu that sells at the LCBO for $14.95 that O&B was charging $55 for. 200% is the norm usually, so it should have been about $44-$45 - The restaurant was incredibly loud. I couldn't hear my siblings sitting across the table from me. It became a point of amusement for us the entire evening.   Despite the food troubles, our service was great and very prompt. Too bad the food and atmosphere couldn't match that."}
{"text":"Great location. Part of Bayview village. Staff is always friendly. Food is never a let down in my opinion. There is typically a bit of a wait time but it is worth it due to the environment and food. I brought my fiance here for winterlicious and I can't describe how good the food was.   If not for winterlicious I would get mac and cheese. Or their steak is always on point. Their burgers are a hug hit too. Pick anything to eat and you'll be making a good decision"}
{"text":"I will never understand why this restaurant is always full...must be the decor and ambiance, because it definitely isn't based on the quality of food.  It is about as basic and tasteless as you can get."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious 2015. Got the perogies (pretty good), haddock and rice combo (very dry, probably not the best idea to pair two dry sides together) and the apple/peach pie (not bad, at least it was moist. Too bad it didn't come with ice cream). All for $25. However quite disappointing as I really had high hopes for the food. Wouldn't order any of them a second time as there are better menu items. The stars are strictly based on the summerlicious menu.   The staff was very attentive once they took our order. Overall a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I attended a birthday at this location this evening. It was half price wine bottle night which was nice. My wifes prosecco was flat but they did replace it when we asked them to. The zuchini chips for an appetizer were very good even of they were on the greasy side (the were cooked correctly but not adequately drained before plating). Where the food really fell off was the evenings special(surf and turf Saturdays). It took a long time but that would have been okay of it was tasty. I had the surf and turf special, haddock croquettes with a 10oz skirt steak. The veg was a kale chip, grilled leek, and a butternut squash puree. The steak was not good, cooked correctly (rare) but it was also covered in a congealed gravy (possible due to the wait...). The gravy added nothing, no flavour at all and it had some sort of herb crumble on it. I am not sure who came up with the combo but they should rethink their profession, I would have been embarassed to serve that at home. The haddock croquettes were very good, nicely browned with a nice flavour. The leek was cooked nicely but they neglected to trim the tough outer layer so it was very tough. The leek underneath was tasty though. The butternut squash puree was very heavy with cream. The light grilled leek was not enough to lighten the flavourless heavy gravy, heavy puree, and deep fried haddock. The kale chip garnish was flavourful and added some much needed taste to the dish. The waiter seemed really turned off when I said that everything was fine but far from good. I did not take him up on his offer of something else, it took long enough the first time. When he neglected to bring my dessert (the only one without at the table) I did not press the matter. At the price point that it was at the meal was deeply unsatisfying and you could do much better at many places all around the city. If you are considering the O&B Cafe I would suggest taking a second and finding something else. On the plus side my wife has celiacs and they did not poison her...and it was half price wine bottles."}
{"text":"Beautiful big outdoor patio. There's a more lively patio with softer seats, and a quieter patio with wooden tables and chairs. Heat lamps. Great outdoor space!  The cocktail menu was pretty interesting. So many cocktails sounded delicious but at the same time not. I was indecisive and eventually ordered the RPG Martini (rhubarb pear ginger). Interesting concept but I had to trade with my dinner partner because it tasted pretty awful. The grapefruit take on the negroni was pretty interesting as well but you couldn't taste the grapefruit, it just looked cloudy. The negroni is currently my favourite cocktail but unfortunately O&B offers a cloudy, watered-down version of it.  The side salad was very mediocre and I would never have expected such a sad salad at a place that is supposed to be owned by some of the most renowned chefs of Toronto. It was basically salad greens tossed in a basic vinaigrette. Nice try with the fennel and radishes but it was super boring. It tasted pretty decent but for a restaurant salad I was expecting more than that.  Once again, overcooked meat at an O&B restaurant. I ordered the rack of lamb and asked for medium rare and it came out medium well. Same thing happened at Luma, another O&B resto, so I wasn't surprised this time around. The beans that came with it were bland, boring, and somewhat overcooked. After I got them out of the way I was able to somewhat enjoy the rest. The sage crustiness around the lamb mixed with the homemade gnocchi really saved the dish. That was some of the best gnocchi I've ever had, and the creaminess with the sage crustiness was really good. This was the saving grace of the dish. The lamb left much to be desired, and was a pretty small portion. They should focus more on the gnocchi in the future, it really is a highlight there. They should also not overcook their meat.  Unfortunately, the service is fake-friendly and amongst the slowest I've encountered ever at any restaurant of this calibre. Not very helpful when asking for recommendations or additional info, but honest when it came to the after-dinner menu, saying that everyone sends back the Aztec hot chocolate. Good sign? Service was just so impeccably slow and inattentive--everything from ordering, to the empty water glasses throughout the table that we needed to keep asking for refills, to settling up. She was quick to drop the bill on the table after I ordered the worst cappuccino I've ever had at a restaurant, but we had to get up to find someone to pay with so we can leave and that took forever.  Overall, the food was pretty mediocre, the ambiance was great on the patio with the cushy seats and heat lamps. This is an excellent space to work with, unfortunately the dinner crew needs to step it up a notch. I don't find myself returning here again. It depends what you're looking for. Drinks on a nice heated outdoor patio with mediocre and overpriced food is what can be expected here. It's an amazing space and I want to love it and come back but I just can't get over the horribly slow service.  Went to Luma and had a much nicer experience."}
{"text":"This review is a little late so I don't know if the menu items have changed. I've been here plenty of times and would recommend their grilled calamari with bean salad. The portion is small, but the calamari is delicious.   I've also had their 'slow cooked lamb shank vindaloo'- it's a flavourful dish but I'm not really into lamb shank.   Their pastas are pretty good as well, I've tried a few, but again portions are small. Service is average and what would be expected at any OB restaurant.  I would recommend this place for casual lunches, corporate outings or dates where you're unsure how adventurous your partner is and want to play it safe, but still impress.  Your guaranteed good food, good service in a nice atmosphere.  Again, I wish they would change the portion sizes or the prices.."}
{"text":"Came here originally to have brunch but apparently they have have it on the weekend, the octopus was perfectly cooked, it's chewy but not difficult to chew or swallow, definitely do not have to experience those \"chewing forever\" moment!  Freshly baked pizza was my favourite out of the two,  absolutely not comparable to pizza takeout places.  It was pizza of the day so I apologize for not being able to give you guys the name for this pizza!  The atmosphere here is cozy and I can really relax and enjoy my lunch here. Music they have selected was also matching the theme for the restaurant. Not too loud so you won't have to raise your voice to talk to your friends. Decoration and plating were also right at the level where you can enjoy and relax. I'd also like to say thank you to my server that day for giving us such a nice first time experience at this restaurant! Definitely coming back to try out their brunch next time!"}
{"text":"The reviews for this place is pretty extreme - either you love it, or you sound like you wanna burn it down. Luckily for me the visit was quite pleasant - 3.5 stars. It's also a nice place to grab a bite after shopping at Bayview Village.  Came here on a weekend for some brunch (they have a weekend a la carte brunch menu online); staff was friendly and welcoming, which always makes your experience a little better even if the food sucks. The place wasn't super crowded which made for a nice quiet meal, but not so quiet that it was totally dead.  The décor and atmosphere was nice, simple and relaxing; the chairs though were the only thing that bothered me. They were just uncomfortable in general and I had to squirm around a bit. I might request the booths next time.  If you're into waffles like I am, give their Belgian Waffle a try (it was good when I went). Presentation was nice and pretty, although the chocolate and maple syrup was a bit of a sugar overload. Having said though, this was just a nice treat for brunch, do not expect it to be some super awesome waffle and compare with the 'real' waffle places.  Eggs benedict was a nice clean dish, not too filling or heavy like some places can be. I wouldn't suggest ordering something like the o&b breakfast. You're better off at Cora's or Eggsmart if you want something like that."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times, most recently for dinner a few nights ago.  I have always liked the ambiance of the restaurant with it's open kitchen and pizza oven.  It is very cozy even though it's quite a large place.    Our server was very attentive and the food was good.  I ordered off of the seasonal menu and our server had the kitchen accommodate my request not to put anchovy paste in the pasta so the sauce was obviously not pre-made for my dish.    The waiter suggested that my kids share the pizza and Cesar salad both of which seemed to please them.  My father had the 7 oz sirloin and the shrimp (surf and turf) with mashed potatoes and finished every last bite.  The steak was cooked rare, just as he likes it and he is very picky when it comes to his steak.  One of the standout dishes was the Macaroni & Cheese with peas and chicken.  It was quite rich but very tasty.     I have always found that the drinks are on the pricey side but other than that, I don't have any real complaints with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Oliver and Bonacini  I have a theory that somewhere in the corridors of Canadian power, a secret cabal decides that as a country, we are only entitled to a circumscribed range of entertainment choices.   I developed this rule after noticing that it seems like there are only ever five Canadian celebrities at one time. Carla Collins used to be on that list, then she erased herself through plastic surgery. Mike Bullard was ubiquitous. Last I saw, he was hosting real estate infomercials. Brent Butt has run out of gas since his last show ended, and Little Mosque on the Prairie is set in Saskatchewan, so it doesn't count.   Following the celebrity chef craze in the US, it seems like we've lined up our own set, who seem bent on monopolizing Toronto's dining scene. Chief among them, Michael Bonacini, who along with Peter Oliver, represents Toronto's contribution to the mid-range dining scene.   It wasn't always thus. Back in the day, Oliver's tastes ran towards classic french cooking. His restaurant \"Olivers\" was a favourite, especially at brunch. Bofinger, located just north of present-day Didier, did French Bistro with aplomb; we still discuss the weekend dessert buffet.  After a trip upmarket with Jump, Canoe and Auberge Pommier, we were excited when the new, allegedly popular-price cafe opened in Bayview Village.   Dishes have evolved over the years. Kinks, like frozen soggy fries and weird coleslaw have been phased out. Coffee quality ebbs and flows, depending on the supplier. Experiments with nestle and Coca-Cola's Far Coast brand have thankfully been discontinued.   Appetizers are fun. A spring roll basket produces six crisp, tightly-wrapped tubes of veggie goodness accompanied by a sauce that's more sweet than heat.   Onion rings are a steakhouse classic. Blue cheese dipping sauce is unnecessary, but we'll take it. $8 is a bit steep for deep-fried onions though. I'd rather see them as a less-expensive side dish with the decent hamburger, or excellent chicken burger.   Caesar salad is stingily dressed with good Parmesan and maybe a multi-grain crouton or two. Some days, the dressing clings lightly to roughly chopped leaves. Other days, it runs off in a wet skanky pool at the bottom of the bowl. I hate wet salad.   Soups change seasonally. Mushroom soup is touted on the menu, though I don't know why. Repeated samplings reveal a thin, salty broth and gritty pulverized funghi. A thick and hammy black bean soup is better; so is the Tuscan onion soup, when available-a lightly-cheesed Italianate take on the french classic. For my money, you could skip the lot and just prepare a proper French onion soup. I'd order it every time.   Mains are disappointingly inconsistent, except for their uniform shrinkage over time. Fish and chips used to offer two meaty halibut fillets. Now, it's only one strip of Haddock (maybe even half), although you can pay for an upgrade (a recurring theme). Massive portions of ribs, short-or-porky-have been scaled back.    Dinner-plate sized pizzas are now lucky to stretch across a salad plate. One would have hoped that Il Fornello across the street would provide stiff competition; instead the two chains race to the bottom, cutting corners while raising prices.  A portion of the menu is devoted to DIY fish options. Healthy choices, compromised by the frequent appearance of  industrial monstrosities like Basa and Tilapia.  I'm by no means a hardcore locavore, but I've seen enough about these fish to give serious thought about whether one might as well eat the sewage in which they are raised.  I won't preach, but I will pass whenever they make their funky presence known.   Some dishes are as good as ever. In a town that's irrationally exuberant about brunch, O & B do it right. The old \"Power Breakfast\" resurfaces here. Eggs, meat, taters and toast. Awesome. Eggs Benny is done right; the eggs cooked to quivering, with not too salty ham and just-tart Hollandaise. An egg white omelet stuffed with veggies is ideal first-date food.  Breakfast pizza tastes better in the imagination than on the plate. Ham and eggs are roughly chopped and strewn about the crust; I'd have oped for the egg to be set in the oven.   Desserts are fine, but this isn't an environment that lends itself to lingering.   Service is generally swift and professional, although waits between courses can stretch on forever. Management accommodates you if they feel like it. Complaints may be resolved quickly, or not at all.   As the O&B empire expands, I'm glad for decent, accessible food, but miffed about the just-this-far-above-reasonable pricing, and corporate indifference to the diner's overall experience. Surely there's someone out there who's hungry to provide more."}
{"text":"One of the servers here was absolutely despicable - and I made sure to keep my receipt so I can remember who she was. Her name was Addy and I really hope the owner of this place can read my review.   I walked in with my friend today (around 1:40pm), and we were greeted by a lovely lady who works at the front. She got us seated and that's when we first met Addy. I asked her,  \"Excuse me, I know you don't have the high tea anymore-\"   She cuts me off and says, \"Yeah we don't have high tea anymore. It's not in our menu.\"   I say, \"I know, I called in a few days earlier and the lady said that we can just order the tea, cake, and chef's platter for the regular price.  She curtly says, \"Yeah, we don't serve the chef's platter anymore.\"   I say, \"Oh, I just thought you guys did because the lady-\"  She says, \"We don't.\"   Then I'm like, \"Alright that's fine. May we please have the dessert menu?\"  She grabs both our lunch menus (which we were looking at) and then comes back later and throws the two dessert menus on the table.   That's fine, I'm not angry yet. However, she leaves for 15 minutes, and I actually had to ask another server to give me our lunch menus back. She comes back afterwards and crosses her arms beside us without saying anything. I assume that she wants to take our order so my friend and I just order.   5 minutes later, she comes in and roughly puts the plates on our table. My friend was leaned in and talking to me, but Addy just dropped the plate in front of her, rather than asking her to watch out or if she could move a little.   This is still fine. We're not that upset. I actually didn't enjoy my cake that much because it was kind of cold and too sweet (it was the molten cake). I just left half of it on the plate because I didn't want to finish it. Addy later comes by, and asks me if I'm done. I said I am, and she gives me a funny look. When she circles around my table, she talks to another waiter LOUDLY within earshot of me, \"Can you believe it? She's DONE with this!\"   Excuse me? Are you really making fun of me for not finishing my cake that I didn't enjoy? She disappears for ANOTHER 15 minutes. I had to call another person (not a server, he was setting up the table) and asked him if he could get my server to get the receipt. She comes 5 minutes later, and drops (literally drops the receipt + board) on the table. I see that there's only one receipt and I said \"Oh, do you mind separating the bill please?\"   She clicked her tongue and grabbed my receipt off the table. It's hard to describe her attitude through this text, but it was enough for the lady TWO tables down us to say, \"Wow, she really doesn't like you guys does she? Don't worry, she was rude to me too when I sat down.\"   She comes again a while later, throws our receipt down and leaves before I can ask her for the machine. My friend says it's okay, she'll pay with bills so that when Addy is getting her change, I can get the machine. I try to get Addy's attention three times to no avail, but I'm pretty sure she can hear me all three times. When I finally locked eyes with her, she comes and I ask for the  machine. She says (something along the lines of), \"Yeah. I said I was coming.\" I didn't really hear what she said and I said, \"Sorry, can you say that again?\" She says really angrily this time \"I SAID i was coming already.\"   Needless to say, I was really pissed off. I always tip minimum 15% but I really had an awful experience. However, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought she was going through something but gave her only 5%. Regardless, her attitude was appalling and I hope the owner will see to this matter."}
{"text":"This place is a good stable and near home so we wander in here a few times a year. The options just seem limited and we seem to always be looking for new dishes or new creations to  try. Atmosphere is nice but sometimes a little noisy. Just need new menu of dishes!"}
{"text":"For what I got, this place was not worth my hard earned dough. (Okay, not really hard earned, but earned at the very least...)   The space is attractive; the patio is impressive; the crowd is not my scene at all. Better pizza could be had in many places, some for less money. My dining companions seemed to like their dishes (chicken burger, gluten-free seafood pasta) but no-one seemed overly impressed. I had the Soma ice cream and it tasted like Breyer's chocolate ice cream that grandma pulled from its two-year hiding place in the back of the freezer. I hope the stuff straight from the store that I've heard so much about is more impressive...  This place is probably decent for an after-work drink with your douchey banker friends (sorry, I don't mean to give bankers a bad rap. Diff'rent strokes...).  Service was good--hosteses and waiter were friendly/attentive. Maybe if I had more money to throw around, this place wouldn't feel like such a rip."}
{"text":"I came for a work lunch and only tried the crab and cod cake, but the menu looked pretty good with plenty of variety.  The crab and cod cake was really good with the avocado creme, but once I ran out of the avocado, I felt it was a bit dry and bready.  The portion size is also not too large; only one crab cake for an entree.  Service was also pretty slow, even before it got busy."}
{"text":"I always have low expectations for Summerlicious as unfortunately few restaurants serve stuff from their regular menu. But for $15 with a $10 Amex rebate you can't beat a $5 lunch.  We had an early reservation (11:15am) so there was no waiting, but there was a big line when we left at 12:30.  All in all my experience was meh.  I would not pay full price for this place and would not return apart from the convenience factor of it's location.  Food: Warm rolls - warm, moist and chewy  French fries - uneventful but garlic aioli was nice.  a bit limp and no real flavour without aioli or ketchup. Watermelon & Tomato Gazpacho - fresh, flavorful and hint of spicy. I liked the texture. A little on the salty side.  Crispy Fried Chicken Thighs - nice spiced honey wheat berries, chicken nicely fried not too oily but a bit heavier than my tastes on the batter Honey Ricotta Cheesecake - yuck, horrible grainy texture reminds me of curdled milk. Not my thing and not my expectation of for a cheesecake.  Service - friendly and efficient.  Our server was very nice to our number of kids we were with and was quick and accurate."}
{"text":"We came here with a group for some after work drinks. Unfortunately the DJ was too loud and we were seated at a very long table, so couldn't have much of a conversation.  The service was slow - we had been seated for about 15 minutes before they took our drink order. The food was pretty good. I had pasta and the zucchini chips. My colleagues had the pizza and an array of other apps. I would definitely recommend this place on a much slower night."}
{"text":"They are the only game in town in Bayview Village and they seem aware of it. Poor service - slow and not the \"A\" team, food just so-so. I'm not going again."}
{"text":"So I can't quite put my finger on it, but I just can't give this place a raving review.  The boyf has been wanting to try this place for a while, primarily because he and some guys at work had unsuccessfully been able to get lunch reservations a couple of times.  So we had a date night after work one day, and I got off at Union Station and had a quick walk there.  The menu all looked very appetizing, but you won't find anything creatively out of left field.  Just a mish mash of comfort food that's been elevated.  We started with the standard bruscetta, which I whole heartedly recommend.  The crostinis were tasty  and crisp, but oddly, didn't result in a messy bite.  Impressive and delicious!  After that, I'm afraid - things didn't go downhill, but they became sort of mediocre.  My boyf tried the famed mac and cheese - incredibly rich as promised, but the portion wasn't as satisfying as the waitress had claimed.  Nor did it have much variation in flavour, despite its richness.  I had the pancetta & mushroom pizza with whole wheat crust ($1 more, how obnoxious!).  Which was fine, but didn't have much flavour either - pancetta was the primarily taste.  Don't get me wrong, I love salty pancetta, but I thought I could use some highlights from the arugula and the parm-reg cream, as well.  I even had high hopes for the crust, after the delicious crostini bruscetta vehicle.  Alas, no.  However, nothing was terrible, it just simply wasn't remarkable.  The overall ambiance and decor seems to be trying a little too hard to be cool - like it wants to be a place you come to be seen, instead of place you come to eat.  And yes, there were in fact, many beautiful people to be seen!   (I guess this strategy is working?)  Our waitress was extremely attentive, but just slightly too pleased with herself - and definitely displayed an air of superiority when she learned it was our first time dining there.  Girl, it's not that complicated here!    I'm ambivalent about the Q-water option.  On one hand, I'm happy that I'm not being forced to purchase expensive bottled water.  On the other hand, $2.50 per person for filtered still/sparking water, isn't an option that I ever thought I needed?  What happened to the other option?  Just water?  Our super pleased waitress presented us this option, or lack of option, as if O&B was doing us a huge favour.  Thanks, I guess?  In the end, the Q-water was gratefully drank, the food came out in a timely manner, was as described on the menu, and the waitress was terribly positive.  However, the boyf left with a sense of disappointment after all the anticipation, and I have to agree - I think this place might be all sizzle, no snap?"}
{"text":"Very nice looking place, spacious and new.  Very courteous service staff.  Good quality food, and fair prices.  I went for breakfast and found they have some variations to the average breakfast dish that you can't find at most other places.    Derek"}
{"text":"Just sat and had dinner at Mr Bonacini's restaurant. First time there and I must say I was quite impressed. The food was so delicious. Had a summer drink and food specials menu. I had the Lost Craft lager. Such a great beer. The white sangria was my partner's voice of drink, I think him ordering a second can vouch for how good they were. If you like spicy go for the wings, they pack punch. The fries are to die for in my opinion. A highly recommended place next time you are in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great Summerlicious experience. We were a large group and some of us decided to order from the regular menu, cause honestly the choices are so limited. The complimentary warm bread basket was quite nice and fresh. We figured it's better worth it to order wine by the glass than ordering by bottle. Our server was very attentive and the water glasses were filled twice during dinner.   The pork Schnitzel was the least liked. I personally sampled the Schnitzel and found it very salty. The tenderloin steak was a favourite, which is unfortunately not on the Summerlicious menu. It's topped with caramelized onion and was cooked to perfection.  Aside from those, here's my 2 cents on O&B's Summerlicious menu: My 3 course dinner: Rose Wine + Pakora: very spicy, tastes like Falafel with fried eggplant and raita as garnish (4/5)  BBQ Jerk chicken: Mildly spicy, great for those who like spicy food, but can't handle too much spice like me. The dish comes with rice and kidney beans. (4/5)  Beaver Tail: Dough topped with Cinnamon sugar with raspberry and melted chocolate. Very sugary and nowhere near top notch quality in my opinion. It was very A-OK and I give it (3/5)  I've become to believe that Summerlicious is just a good excuse to try out food that you're not familiar with and wouldn't normally order if it was on the regular menu."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that draws you in because of their decor. I'm one of those people who automatically thinks the place is good if their patio and colourful seats are appealing. I went here during summer time and when I actually sat down I realized that I have to now look at some construction site cause now the perspectives have been changed. The inside is much better in my opinion. The food? meh... Not a fan at all. The service? meh as well. The bar? again, it looks great from the outside, but when you go in you might have a change of mind."}
{"text":"Although hesitant to come here with some out of country guests after a few less than successful visits to the Bayview Village location, I was really glad I did.  Wanted to be able to offer my guests a wide menu selection with good quality food, but also reasonable prices. It was hard to pick a place since most places with good eats come with a big price tag in the downtown core. But O&B looked up to be the best option, and was super close to their home for the week at 1 King west.   We ate family style and shared the beef short ribs, a prosciutto pizza, salad, salmon, pasta dish and a few desserts and they, as well as myself, were happy with all our choices.  Friendly and attentive service throughout the night was appreciated and the evening went smoothly!  Would go back!"}
{"text":"This is one restaurant that I do tend to favour a lot. It's great for catching up with old friends or getting to know new ones. Most of the time at restaurants I opt to get steaks but this place seems to push me out of my comfort zone and try something I normally wouldn't. Being a Friday night I opted to try their fish special of the day : Pan Seared Cod on a bed of Yam mash and what appears to be rapini with some honey glaze truffle butter.   What I really like about the special is how much it reminded me how much I like black cod, the savoury sweet buttery aspect of it all. Was this as great as black cod? no. But I did thoroughly enjoy eating it together with yam. How come I didn't think of eating fish with yams before? Probably because I am super lazy and can't cook anything with more than one ingredient. Nevertheless this is why I pay the dollars to try something I wouldn't have thought of.   Throughout the meal, I also enjoyed one of their freshly squeezed juices: a hot pear cider which hit the spot. At the beginning of the meal I was hoping to finish with an apple pie/crumble dessert which they do not offer, but this was a good place holder as it carried similar aromas and textures as a mush in my mouth and cinnamon in my nose. I still would have liked to see apple pie on the dessert menu.   This is the first time I chose not to go with a dessert at this location. I typically go with a lava cake, but the last few times I have tried it all I got was half done brownie and nothing that resembled flowing chocolate lava that I see on tv. I almost went with it again this time only to glance over at the table next to me to see if it was what I have wanted to see but sadly it was just more of the same. I passed.   Overall I still enjoyed my time here, great convenient location right off the 401, happy atmosphere with attentive staff in J-Crew flannel. I have been here with many people and will likely do so again. See you when I have more money Oliver & Bonacini."}
{"text":"Usually I came to this place religiously in the past. The customer service has declined considerably. My dad suffers from kidney problems and needs to eat a low sodium diet. We requested that they omit or put less noodles in his dish. The waitress was adamant about the fact that the meals cannot be modified as the chef does not accommodate that. This was ridiculous in my opinion and indicates no consideration for the customer. Such an establishment should have more consideration for their customers needs"}
{"text":"I was here with my friend a month ago, and chose it because of location (vs. Biff's next door, where I've been a few times now)  Atmosphere & Service: Liked the ambiance very much. On the modern side, yet comfortable and thankfully unstuffy. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Our water glasses were never empty and he checked on us at proper intervals without being intrusive.  Food: We both had the Arugula Salad. It was ok, nothing special but it was exactly as described on the menu. The dressing was well balanced. My friend had the Burger. She said it was good, but it looked way overdone to me. It certainly wasn't juicy, and the grey interior made me glad I didn't have it.  ...I dunno about $22 for a dry-looking bacon burger. I had the Beef Cheek with mushroom 'risotto'. The beef was FABULOUS. Meltingly tender. Luscious! (I'm now determined to do it at home now :).  The risotto was disappointing. The flavour was rich and had a decent amount of asst. mushrooms  (although a bit salty).  Sadly, I am sure it was made with regular rice and not with Arborio or Carnaroli rice as it should.  I would still highly recommend this dish though - just a warning not to expect proper risotto.  Since I've been let down many times ordering steak, this is an excellent alternative when you're craving beef. It's been quite some time that a dish has been this memorable.  If you're into Osso Buco, you will like this better (IMHO ;)) Beefy, gelatinous, braised goodness... mmm!  $32 is a very fair price for this dish.  Yes, I'll be back and likely order the same, or make my dining partner order it so I can steal some when they're not looking."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and I have to say that I've been pretty content both times: in Yelp terminology, \"A-OK\". Although, I must admit that one of the selling points of this place is its prime location.   The first time I was here was for a birthday gathering with a handful of close friends. I ordered the \"Wise Resolution\" cocktail and the butternut squash ravioli. Service was friendly but pretty slow, and the food wasn't that memorable. I should mention, however, that I brought in cupcakes and they were really great about bringing out plates and cutlery so we could eat them.   More recently, I was here was for a work dinner with my team. We requested a private table and ended up sitting in this long booth behind the host area. It's an interesting concept, but we had to keep passing things down the table which was a bit annoying. To start, we ordered some bruschetta, spring rolls, and shrimp for the table. I had the margharita pizza as my main. Once again, the food was fine, but nothing blew me away. Drinks were good - I had a regular Manhattan in lieu of the O&B version (the combination of vanilla and liquor makes me want to gag), as well as a glass of wine (J. Lohr) and some custom-made pineapple cocktail. Our server was friendly and a strong upseller, always making suggestions, but not extremely attentive, which I think could be partly attributed to how busy this place is...all the time. Reservations are strongly recommended.  The space is modern and clean, but it can get really loud, which makes intimate conversations difficult. I would say it's a decent choice for groups, because the menu has such a wide variety of options (ranging from curry to pizza to steak) that there's likely to be something for everybody."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was really good, but beware when ordering the nachos, YOU NEED AT LEAST 4 OR 6 MOUTHS FOR IT! Do not get it if it's just 2-3 people because it was a lot!!! But it was so delicious.  Also, if you're feeling like dessert, try the Banoffee jar! i really liked it, plus you can get a smaller version for cheaper (i think  $3.50), and the portion was already satisfying.  The staff was very friendly, and I loved the overall look of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Mediocre food... but the restaurant has a decent upscale atmosphere which is a bit hard to find in the North York area. My mom and I do keep coming back here, we enjoy the Seafood Spaghettini."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times for lunch on weekdays over the last 4 months. There are lots of white collar guys around so service is definitely above average. The space is nice and the patio during the summer is amazing.   During the summer, they had a bahn mi chicken burger that I loved (it also came with sweet potato fries, major plus). Unfortunately they got rid of that since I couldn't find it when I came again a few weeks ago. So, if anyone from the restaurant is reading, please bring that back!!!!   Also tried the Friday fish cake special and can't say I loved it... It was very underwhelming and quite frankly I wish I ordered something else."}
{"text":"I have only been there once, and decided to never go back again! and I haven't! This is one of those places that you hear a lot about, and once you actually get there you can't understand what the whole fuss was about!  Located \"Un-conveniently\" at the intersection of Yonge and Front, which is impossible to park anywhere, and you'll end up parking somewhere across the street at one of the parking structures!  They have one unified menu for both lunch and dinner menus, from what I understood..which has a good range from your typical bar/pub comfort food all the wayto steaks, ribs and fish selections..  Service is bad, typically a place at a prime location like this, charging higher prices, the least to expect is having a proper service. Unfortunately, this isn't the case at this Oliver & Bonacini!  In terms of taste, it's okay if you were at a deserted area, where there are no other restaurants to dine at! but this is Toronto fellas, the options are limitless, and you can't survive among the leaders of the dining scene in the city, with a mediocre menu like this."}
{"text":"They have a really good formula happening here, quality food, comfort as well as pleasant service! The menu selection is varied and has many healthy yet satisfying options Soups are very good too and I love the wine selection, comfortable seating and ambiance! This is a chain that's good for any occasion, be it a date, casual lunch or a business meeting! On my list of go to places!"}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  I'm giving this a 2 star rating because the description is exactly how I feel \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and it wasn't quite a 3 star rating which is described as \"A-OK.\"  If you don't want to read a rant, scroll down for a brief summary.  I've been to other O&B restaurants , such as Canoe, Bannock, and  Auberge du Pommier. (canoe by far the best).  Even at Bannock which is probably the closest to O&B bayview that can relate was much better, in taste service and quality.  The  restaurant was beautiful in its décor, however was quite loud both because it was busy, and because of the radio playing, clearly trying to drown out the noise of customers.  My date and I made a 7pm reservation, we arrived and requested a booth, it was quite busy but they were able to accommodate.  We decided to each order things off the Summerlicious menu. Starters: Clam chowder / perogies Main: haddock jambalaya  / pork schnitzel Dessert: O&Beaver Tail / Peach & Apple Pie  (STARTERS) The clam chowder was alright, nothing special, they mixed some bacon on top with 2 crushed saltine crackers. I did enjoy it, and was a nice mix of salty and creamy. but all in all nothing really stood out.   The perogies were nice, the order came with 3 with a little side of sour cream, and bacon sprinkled on top. the perogies tasted distinctly like olive oil, and appeared drenched.  They were good and my date approved, however it was not up to the standard I had come to expect with O&B, aside from the bacon crumble and the overpowering taste of EVOO, they were quite bland.  (MAINS) The haddock Jambalaya, if you can call it that, was just a whole lot of MEH. It was 3 pieces of haddock battered, on a bed of fried rice with red peppers and green onions. The menu mentioned sausage, but after examining the dish I could not find any whatsoever, maybe they fried it in sausage grease but clearly no sausage was to be found in this dish.  The rice was half decent for fried rice, but no sauce whatsoever and hardly reminiscent of a Jambalaya.  The rice showed black burn marks on much of it, as you would expect from a frying pan.  Now the Haddock, it wasn't Bad per say, but had absolutely no flavor. it was far to battered, and that was the only taste I could find, the fish was a good portion, but not even a lemon wedge, tartar sauce or balsamic vinegar to be had, with no sauce this was just bland dry and unoriginal. (O&B if you are reading this, add some sort of sauce or at least a lemon wedge with your fish and rice) The haddock was bland unoriginal, Order something else if you see it on the menu.  The pork schnitzel was a pork cutlet on a bed of shredded cabbage with potatoes on top and lemon butter. This was my dates dish, though I did try it, best part was the lemony potatoes, my date was not impressed and nor was I. The pork was dry and overcooked, and the cabbage had little to no dressing. Basically this dish was a dry cutlet with a hint of lemon and crunchy undressed cabbage underneath defiantly not to the standards we have come to expect at O&B restaurants.   (Dessert) Id like to start off by saying dessert was delayed, I guess it is no fault of the staff, but our waitress came by to apologies for the delay as receipts were not printing. Between finishing our main course and getting dessert it was about a half an hour to 45 minute wait.  After our wait we received desserts, after a little mix-up on delivering us the wrong ones it was quickly corrected. I had the O&Beaver tail, which was somewhat dry and dense, they gave me a fork but it would not cut through, so I requested a knife as well. It was sugary, and good, however once again quite bland. The standout taste was the chocolate sauce, however it tasted commercial and not homemade, as though it came out of a premade bag.  My date ordered the Peach and apple pie, It was honestly quite good, it was a little square, center cut, with no crust and had a dollop of whip cream on top. I enjoyed it & so did my date. My only complaint would be that it wasn't warmed up, it was served room temperature, I just feel if it were served hot it would have been so much better.  (Summery) In summery, this O&B  restaurant does not meet the level of excellence I have come to expect from the O&B name. For $25 you get what you pay for in terms of the Summerlicious menu, however don't expect anything spectacular, It was a bland meal with no real charm, and the wait staff seemed over taxed due to the busyness of the location during Summerlicious. If you are looking for a casual meal out while taking in some shopping at the mall, this is probably one of the better options in terms of restaurants offered. I would not go out of my way to come here again, and would instead opt for a higher end O&B restaurant. This is casual mall dining with a classy cover."}
{"text":"OK. The lunch/dinner here is bleh, i mean its edibe, its even good, the decore is nice, etc. etc. the scene is old and its in bayview village which is even older. What I do like, is brunch. i had polenta with l amb sausage and 2 poached eggs, holy shit was that good. Ended up being an expensve breakfast ($27?) I think it was the smoothie i ordered, geez that organic flax seed oil can get pricey. Either way, its the best brunch in north york hands down (by north york i mean north of lawrence).  enjoy"}
{"text":"Oliver & Bonacini at Oakville Place has this awesome patio!   What makes it more awesome is 50% off Bar Menu Monday to Wednesday from 3 pm!  Now I know where to go for Happy Hour when I visiting Oakville!"}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2017 Dinner $28 experience  I did not particular enjoy the whole experience. I do give O&B credit that they really master how to run a Licious efficiently! The menu was designed with items that are mostly pre made and can just served quickly.  We ordered:  Seafood Chowder - Nice and Creamy, A-OK! Warm Pancetta & Fontina Gougeres - What is that??! Worst app I ever have! They were cold, even the tomato sauce was cold  Braised Beef Short Rib Gnocchi - Rib was really good! But some of the gnocchi was not cooked through Chicken Coq au Vin - Dark meat chicken was served which was moist, A-OK!  Bana Tarte Tatin - The pastry a little stale and hard Warm Chocolate Torte - OK  Thyme Cocktail was not bad but unfortunately there was a rubber band in my drink??!! The server took it off my bill and did offer to have it remake.   The service was fast and maybe too efficient and impersonal."}
{"text":"I have an excellent Sunday Brunch experience at O & B Cafe Grill.  Everyone here is so friendly and nice. My waitress is really cheerful and outgoing.. and gorgeous too!  FARM HOUSE HAM CRESPELLE ($14.25) goat cheese creamed spinach & smoked ham rolled in a handmade crêpe baked in grainy mustard Béchame - Creamy and fulfilling - Served pipping hot from the oven, I was surprise to find out how hot it is when I tried eat a whole piece in one bite! - The goat cheese went so well with the saltiness for the ham and a touch of sweetness in the creamy sauce - The crepes itself is fresh, soft and with a good bite  Services is excellent. Everyone here is smiling... I guess what not to happy about on a nice day.  I will be back for another brunch or even a drink of the lovely patio!!  ."}
{"text":"I came here with reservations for friends' birthday but we had to wait 30 minutes before we could sit down. The service was nice, they explained the delay was because the previous tables paid but stayed longer than expected. At least they gave 6 plates of free appetizers for 11 of us while we waited at the bar.   I ordered the O&B Mac and cheese with roasted chicken and peas based on recommendation from a friend. It was really bland with tiny strips of chicken and not warm enough. I was really hungry by waiting but I couldn't finish it. 3 of my other friends order mac&cheese too and they didn't like it as well.   Overall the service was good and the atmosphere is nice and classy. But the food was really mediocre at best. I feel like Kraft Dinner would have tasted better.  The only saving grace is the sweet potato fries that I shared with my friend.  Warning: They include tips in your bill, one of my friends made a mistake of double tipping on her card. But they were nice to give her money back.  I think next time if I come again, I'll try something different but I don't think I'll ever decide to come here on my own. I don't mind spending more on quality food but this place just didn't meet up to expectations."}
{"text":"Overpriced, puffed up and mediocre. The service is pleasant enough, but the chef thinks he's got something special going when really the food is plain and memorable only for how it disappoints. Overpriced everything. A crime what they charge for wines. Intensely dislike."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overhyped. This contemporary Italian dining spot is not exactly well worth the price. While the interior decor is pleasant and ambience is lively, the food was short of decent."}
{"text":"I hosted a business lunch yesterday. Nice place, and I think it is ideal for business meetings, for that I'll give it 5 *. However, in terms of the food, hmmm. not quite what I was expecting: My steak salad wasn't that great at all. The steak, was good, but really it was just thrown on some letters with a Asian flavor vinaigrette ... odd combination and definitely no much thought was put into this dish, it was just OK.   My invitees looked just okay with the Pizzas, and no major comments. Dessert arrived late (it was taken off the bill), pretty much when coffee was done. On the dessert side, there's one dessert that caught my attention : Bacon tart. I tried that and it was excellent. That actually was the highlight of the meal.  Anyway, I'll book this place again only if I don't have any other options around. Not bad, just OK but I'm in the search of excellent venues to have outstanding meals and great ambiance to do business."}
{"text":"I am giving it a five star because they don't have a 4.75  I have had many meals here because I live locally.  Always reliable for good service (attractive staff) and very good food, if not always excellent.  Reliable to bring business clients. Tables are close but seems to work.  The new renovation since April looks terrific. Upscale.  For such a major city Toronto does not have a lot of 4 pr 5 star restaurants. O&B helps.  Good luck with the business.  John C."}
{"text":"I've been here twice: the service has been great, the staff friendly, the food delicious, and it's never been too crowded. Even when it did get a bit crowded, I never felt the staff rushing my friends and I even though we had already long finished our meals.   I've had the Eggs Benedict with salmon, and on another occasion I had the French Toast with fried chicken. I enjoyed both of them, though today the potatoes weren't as crispy on the outside as I would have liked. Also they offer three kinds of water; I must've picked the expensive one be a use it showed up on our bills!   But these small things didn't affect my experience. I've never had any other meal here other than brunch.   If you live in the northern part of the city, definitely give this place a try if you're looking for good brunch. The meals are delicious and will cost around $15 + tax.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. Greeted the moment I walked in the door. Found the reservation, advised guests had already arrived, taken to the table right away. Everything at the table was great with our server Cesar. Our appetizer round was great, our entrées were great our drinks never were empty. We were too full for dessert  There wasn't too little service or too much service. Special requests were granted without hesitation.  The price was right, portion size too. The restaurant and the staff were very presentable, neat & clean. On the way out the door we were thanked. I spent most of my professional career in hospitality/retail management and from start to finish that is what it should be like all the time anywhere you go. I'll be back and I would highly recommend it to anybody who hasn't tried it"}
{"text":"Fine dining in... Oakville Place? Ontario's Lamest Mall hosts this upscale resto by the brains behind Canoe. The vast interior is splendid and and includes a lounge and private dining room. I don't remember much about the food at all, except that it was \"OK.\"  Apparently their chef specializes in sous vide; meaning all the meals are prepared in a tepid bathtub 'round back. (Probably not.) The service was top-notch. I would try it again, if I somehow ended up at this Godforsaken mall again.  Obligatory Title Pun: OLIVER problems will BONA-- forget it.  Menu Readability: Good use of a sans-serif font and lots of leading.  Need to mention: Being in a mall, this place has a corkload of parking. If you're into that sort of thing.  What this place teaches me about myself: It's hard to think of puns when you have the song \"Oom-Pah-Pah\" blasting through your head."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday night around 10pm, after other options for a late-night snack proved fruitless. There's not a lot of eats in this district, so I was happy to hear the clamour of diners when I stepped inside. Me and my DC grabbed a two-top.   The dining hall is black and white and Oliver and Bonacini-ish -- those monstro upside-down tin buckets acting as lamps are cool -- but it was loud and the vibe was not right. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it just felt wrong. When the waiter came to take our drink orders, I panicked, pulled a L____,[*] and asked if we could sit in the lounge instead. My DC looked at me like I was crazy.  But what a difference scenery makes. It was subdued and relaxing in the lounge and much better decorated too. Wide plank herringbone floors? Awesome. We grabbed a seat at the long bar and ordered some Ahi tuna lettuce wraps and some veal sliders from their bar menu. The trio of sliders were served with exactly 13 \"house-made crisps.\" The chipotle mayo on the burgers was tangy, but the veal was a bit dry for my liking. The lettuce wraps (five on the plate) were a creative idea (soy-dipped tuna, avocado and these crispy things on top) but I would have preferred the avocado to be less soft; it made the entire thing kind of goopy and wet.  I washed down the snacks with their Manhattan with vanilla-infused Wiser's. It was interesting but I wasn't feeling the vanilla. The bartender confessed it was an extract (\"using real beans is a mess\") but I don't know if that would have helped.  So overall this was an A-OK experience with execution a little off the mark. Nothing particularly offensive about my visit, but my socks were not knocked from their standard positions. Am I expecting too much from O&B? (Pauses to inspect bill... $60 for nibbles and a single cocktail). Maybe not.   Obligatory Title Pun: O don't B like that.  Menu Readability: Fantastic, as is typical of these boys.  Need to mention: The old map of Toronto behind the bar is a spiffy focal point.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'm a priss about a \"vibe\" all of a sudden. What's up with that?   _____ [*] Let me tell you about my ex. Basically she was a _very_ picky dining companion. We have left restaurants because it was too bright inside, or too dim, or because a server waved us to a table instead of accompanying us to a seat, or because of the menu length (too long/too short), etc. We'd often get up seconds after sitting down to the bewilderment of staff. I got so accustomed to this, that in my own mind I dubbed it \"Pulling a L____.\" There you go."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week for a Mother's Day dinner. I had pretty high expectations because most of my family absolutely loves this place. However, I was a little unimpressed, maybe because it was hyped up for me so much.   I definitely love the atmosphere, it has that bustling, casual market type feel. At some points it seemed like there were more staff than customers but the service was fast and efficient so no complaints in that department.   The fact that it is a reputable name made me expect a lot more in terms of food, and general \"bang for your buck\". Nothing on the menu particularly jumped out at me. Shared the caesar salad and onion ring appetizer. As someone already mentioned, the salad was weak....if you're supposed to be a gourmet restaurant at least throw a big tasty crouton on the salad! I make better caesar at home and I don't really try that hard. I did enjoy the onion rings though and it was a really generous portion.   Everyone at my table really enjoyed their main dish. We all tried the roasted rack of lamb, ribs, sesame seared tuna, shrimp linguine and a pizza, and they were all polished off and enjoyed. The only thing here is that the price points could be a littler lower, I think. Having eaten at places where I've gotten better quality food for less, I'm a little bit more particular when it comes to paying close to $30 for an entree if it doesn't fill me up. Good thing I wasn't paying :)   I do have to mention that instead of dessert we all got some sort of coffee beverage and I had the most amazing americano ever made! Props to O & B for that. All in all, I had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. If I think about the restaurant critically though, there are some definite flaws."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  The mushroom soup is the bomb and they also have different specials from Monday to Friday.  Some of the prices are a little too overpriced however their dessert is the bomb especially the cheesecake with phyllo pastry.  A must have!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner this evening. Although we made reservations well ahead of time, we still had to wait because the table was not yet ready. Besides this snafu, the rest of the night went without a hitch.  We ordered the mushroom soup, the spinach dip, the oven-roasted chicken breast, and the grilled salmon. The mushroom soup was very tasty. The spinach dip was tasty as well, though is spicy and saltier than I would like. It comes with carrot and celery sticks, crostini sticks, and flatbread topped with marinara sauce (tasted like pizza). The salmon is cooked medium and was prepared perfectly, not dry. And the chicken was also juicy. The chicken comes with potato gnocchi and mushrooms.  The restaurant's decor was nice. I thought the tables were too close to each other, making it feel crowded. Our server was attentive and filled our water glasses frequently."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 2pm with a friend.  We were told there would be a wait.  We looked around and there were many empty tables.  We went back and asked the hostess if those tables were free and if we could sit there.  She said \"if we told you it's a wait, it's a wait\".  I was speechless at how rude she was.  Will not be eating here ever again."}
{"text":"This time I came back with two other friends and I ordered the mac and cheese and raspberry lemonade.  The mac and cheese was  great, but the raspberry lemonade tasted neither like raspberry nor lemon even though there were tons of raspberry seeds at the bottom of my cup.    The wait staff here this time were great and very competent, extremely accommodating.    One thing to note is that it was FREEEZING in the restaurant.  Drafts everywhere.  They might want to look into some insulation here...."}
{"text":"The summerlicious menu was definitely disappointing, everything was very safe. From the starters to the dessert, nothing really came out amazing or tasted great. However, I guess this is one of the few times that you could say this is what you pay for. There were customers around us with very tasty looking plates that were not part of the summerlicious menu. Though, I was hoping for the same amount of ambiance and food. I started with the focaccia bread with wild mushrooms and honey. It looked like an enlarge bruschetta and it didn't tasted amazing. The honey definitely gave the plate a much needed boost in flavour. My main as a shrimp and crab cake with avocado that turned into guacamole on top. It promised mango notes which were definitely a miss because it was a smear on the side of the plate. Viola, classy fine dining! The dessert which I was looking the most forward to was the worst part of the meal. It was a cold chocolate brownie with a scoop of ice cream. It is a dessert a two year could make.   Definitely disappointed Oliver & Bonacini."}
{"text":"I haven't been to O&B Café Grill for a while, and since they updated their menu, I decided to have dinner there one day.   We started with a melting artichoke, chickpea and parmesan dip ($15.50), served with assorted flatbreads, veggies, crostini and bread sticks. I liked the creative presentation with the bread sticks. At first, I thought there was very little dip and that a lot of bread would be leftover. However, that small plate of dip went quite a long way, and we managed to finish most of bread with it. I had imagine the dip to taste like hummus, but the artichoke flavour was quite strong. In the end, I think I enjoyed munching on the large variety of bread more than the artichoke dip itself.   I also got a side of beer battered onion rings ($7.95), which comes with a blue cheese dip. We requested for the spicy tomato mayo instead. Eight bucks seemed a little pricey for onion rings, but this basket was ginormous! I love thick cut onion rings, and these were excellent! Not exactly the healthiest side, but who can resist onion rings?  My bf ordered a chicken burger ($14.75) with lean ground chicken, crispy bacon, Monterey Jack and chipotle mayo. I'm always reluctant to order non-deep fried chicken in fear that it'll be bland and dry. Thankfully, the chicken here was very moist, and I loved that smoky flavour. I think we were both surprised how much we enjoyed this chicken burger (he totally didn't want to share this burger with me!) The burger came with a side of Caesar salad- balsamic croutons, maple bacon, tossed in a creamy garlic and Parmigiano-Reggiano dressing. The maple bacon was indisputably the best part of the salad.  To finish off a filling meal, we shared one of my all-time favourite desserts: classic vanilla crème brûlée ($8.25). I didn't really care for the accompanying shortbread cookie, but the crème brûlée itself was quite delicious and satisfying.   Overall, it was a good meal. I probably wouldn't order the artichoke dip again, but I would come back for the chicken burger and the onion rings."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving just isn't the same without turkey! This year, I continued my quest for the perfect traditional turkey dinner (because my mom doesn't like or cook turkey). I saw an online ad for O&B's Thanksgiving specials so I decided to give it a try.   Upon arrival, I was surprised that this \"Thanksgiving special\" wasn't advertised at all at the restaurant, and we had to inquire about it. Luckily, we came just in time to sweep up the last two orders available for the night.   Their traditional roast turkey dinner included both white and dark meat, sage bread pudding, Yukon gold mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts, Northern Ontario cranberry sauce and gravy. I definitely liked the dark meat better than the white meat because it was more moist and flavourful. The sage bread pudding was a little too salty on its own, but went well with sweet cranberry sauce (I love cranberry sauce!). Altogether, I liked the combination of all the different flavours.  The Thanksgiving dessert special was Niagara apple strudel with sweet spiced pumpkin gelato. I found the strudel to be mediocre, probably because I'm not a big fan of strudels. I much prefer apple pies or apple crumbles. However, the pumpkin gelato was a refreshing delight! I wished that it had been paired with a pumpkin pie. But all in all, it was a satisfying Thanksgiving meal and we were more than happy with it."}
{"text":"My love and I went here last night for Valentines dinner. It was a last minute decision; we didn't make any big plans. However we ere feeling up to going out for dinner and decided to stay fairly close to home - we didn't want to drive downtown Toronto.   Some of my family members had eaten here before and highly recommended it. My love and I came here for a quick pit stop once in the summer for a drink so we were unable to judge to menu and service in detail.   We order one pre-fixe meal and one regular menu item plus a few cocktails and a bottle of wine.  We had to wait about 5-10 mins past or reservation time as they were clearing some tables. So we decided to get a cocktail at the bar. Overall, the service started off a bit shaky. The bartender was slow at taking our order and making the drinks. Before we got our drinks our table was ready. We sat down and were into such to our server but it took him a while to come back for our order. We ended up asking the sever to change one of our cocktails because it tastes as if there was no alcohol in the drink. We ordered the Mule and it was quite good but the gin based drink with blackberries was no good! Our server was nice enough to exchange it.   Overall the food came quite promptly following each other. We started off with the beet salad and the butternut squash salad. Both were really good. However for the butternut squash salad, we felt it would be better served on a bed of arugula and not just on its own. We would definitely order both again.   For the mains, we had the beef tenderloin and the shrimp pasta. Both were so good!! The temperature of the meals was very good too. Too many times restaurants will bring out the food lukewarm. This was a for sure plus for us. Both Meeks were cooked well and very flavourful. We shared both plates. We choose a bottle of Chilean Sauvignon Blanc and it was excellent as well, not too dry.   Lastly, we shared a dessert: a sort of chocolate meringue invention. It was just ok for us. We would have preferred a simple mini cheesecake instead.   Alex was our server and although it was slow to begin he turned out being really great. He made our dinner experience comfortable and casual and he was very knowledgeable about the foods etc. he checked up on us regularly to make sure everything was great.   We were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and are eager to come back some other time. The only reason why they do not get a 5 star rating from us this time is because: our table was not ready at our reservation time, the first round of drinks lacked alcohol and once we were seated the service took a while."}
{"text":"We were seated by the bar area and the decor was nice and simple with a modern contemporary look to it. We ordered right asap as we were all starving. For appetizers, the group got the melting spring artichoke and goat cheese dip and the buttermilk battered onion rings. The two were pretty much inhaled by group. The winner of the two was definitely the artichoke and goat cheese dip. The onions rings were good but it didn't stand out.  For me, I ordered a pint of Creemore with their lamb burger topped with goat cheese, tomato, lettuce and red onion which all come standard with the burger. The orders came out in a timely fashion even with the large crowd they were handling that night. My girlfriend ordered the mac and cheese with smoked bacon. I know I looked at her with a raised eyebrow when she told me what she was ordering. But she did say that it's good here and she felt like it for dinner. I guess let's hope for the best. =P  I got my lamb burger with caesar salad and the salad was quite disappointing. There wasn't enough dressing and my biggest complaint would be the amount of water on the bottom of the bowl. I felt like they washed it quickly and tossed it once or twice. The burger which was recommended by a friend on the table, didn't meet my expectations. I mean the burger was alright, but the amount of meat given was far too little. The meat patty was quite a bit smaller than the bun and the amount of cheese given appeared to be the same size or thicker than the patty itself. The lamb burger was cooked alright and there were still moisture in the patty. Which when cooking a lamb or turkey burger, overcooking and making the patty dry is something most of us worry about. The girlfriend's mac and cheese was okay. She enjoyed it and surprisingly filled her. She even had remains. But as expected with mac and cheese, try and eat it sooner than later as the overall experience drops dramatically once it gets a little colder. For dessert, the gf and I shared the chocolate masquise and it was once again, alright nothing special here.  Overall, I can't say I really liked Oliver and Bonacini - Cafe and Bar. I mean it was alright pretty much across the board except for maybe the appetizer area. But then the question comes, would you really want to go to Oliver and Bonacini just for drinks and apps? I don't think I would. I mean a friend also recommended the ribs, but I wasn't in the mood nor do I feel this is the place for killer ribs. So for this price category I would probably pick another place. But if your biggest concern is the 'posh' effect, then Oliver and Bonacini might be the place for you, especially for drinks."}
{"text":"The bread was so fresh! The drinks were meh. One drink was so spicy that most people took the peppers out and almost gaged. I tried the steak, which was supposed to be medium rare... and bloody as it were... but was extremely chewy.... didn't taste right."}
{"text":"The ribs were awesome! And the lamb as well! Unluckily I just ordered chicken...The chicken is ordinary..."}
{"text":"My review is just based on the service and alcohol, since I have not eaten here Came here a few times for drinks, both inside and on the patio The staff is very friendly and the service is good Great after work crowd Drinks are priced similar to any bar in the area The inside is great for chilly day and the patio is very spacious and great for nice days out"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice about the restaurant is the ambiance and the atmosphere that speaks to the kind of experience they will deliver.   Without question the service was five star and the food really backed it up. We had the spinach dip which lived to the hype and two steaks for the main. Both with different sides they delivered in flavour and presentation. By far the star of the evening was the truffle oil fries. We couldn't help but devour them!  Whether its going to a show or just wanting a nice evening out. This should be one of the first on your list."}
{"text":"Since I live nearby , the location is perfect for me and I love the decor but the food ? Not spectacular and it's ridiculously expensive .  We went there for breakfast , the pancake was tasteless and my husband and I paid $55 for a pancake dish and Belgium waffles !! The service was slow and horrible .  A few weeks later I went with a group of friends for lunch . I had pizza and again I was so disappointed . The pizza was dry and tasteless .  Third time's a charm ? Well , I'm not willing to find out !"}
{"text":"I was traveling in Toronto for work, and we needed some place to eat at 8:00pm on a Sunday...not an easy task in Canada. We chose this place because it had a wide variety of food (seafood, Asian, pizza, etc), and nothing was crazy...more normal, comfort food. The place next door had like cow stomach or something. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with the service and food. We ordered spring rolls for an appetizer, and then I had a mixed green salad with my mac n' cheese with bacon. Yum! The mac n' cheese was good. Breaded crumb topping, small bites of bacon, and cheesy. Taste wasn't bland at all. Our waiter was nice, and the chocolate marquise was like a chocolate mousse souffle. My coworker got the steak and was very satisfied. I'd definitely come back. The only odd thing about this place was the \"go-green\" motto, so everything looks fancy, but upon closer inspection is a cheap alternative. For example, they have battery operated \"candles\" and the cloth napkins really was made from paper.   Also looks like they had gluten-free pasta, which would've made my sister happy."}
{"text":"Amazing food experience here. Hubby and I went for late lunch. Food was amazing. Especially loved our appetisers the calamari and strawberry beet salad. I will be thinking about that salad for a long time!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a couple of girlfriends. I loved the decor. The place was packed with late diners (our reservation was for 8:30pm). It's definitely a place where you can come in a large group and chat.  We went for the $25 Summerlicious deal. I ordered cobb salad for the appy, PEI mussels for the entree, and carrot cake for the dessert.  Cobb Salad: 1/5 1/2 Iceberg lettuce, some kind of guacamole, 4 small pieces of bacon, half a hard-boiled egg with bleu cheese crumbles. NOT IMPRESSED. DIDN'T FINISH.  PEI Mussels: 2/5 They had this weird smell. The broth was lacking flavour. I've had better mussels at Richtree/Marche. The portion size was ok.  Carrot Cake: 4/5 YUM. Best dish of the night.  One friend ordered the steak frites. She said it was bland and she didn't finish it. The other girlfriend ordered the cod dish and she also said that it had this weird smell to it (a fishy smell? hahaha..)   I ordered a cocktail ($6.95) and my tab came up to $40 incl. taxes and tips. I expected A LOT more from a $40 dinner.   Will not go back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, attentive and polite.  Great favorite foods like wings, calamari fried or grilled, fusilli pasta and cold beer.  Clean modern  decor with good seating capacity."}
{"text":"We go hear all the time.  The food is fantastic.  I'm a big fan of the Quinoa salad and the Tuna."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Went because we had a $50 gift certificate and wanted to try it. Went with my husband. We both had a cup of mushroom soup. I had gnocci, he had a burger. I also had a \"refresher\" (mocktail). Was not terrible, but would never go back.  Drink: Way to sweet. Like Diabetes inducing sweet. 2/10. would have probably been okay if less weet Mushroom soup: Okay, lacking flavour. With adding salt and lots of pepper it was about 6/10. Gnocci: Weird lemon flavour. Very small portion 4/10 Bread: 8/10 (would have been happy if we had been given more, or given it when we had soup) husbands burger: 7/10 (over priced though)  Not worth the price for any of the food. Have had much better food for less.  Waiter was friendly. Atmosphere was nice. Food was boring, bland and over priced."}
{"text":"Food: average Price: expensive based on food quality Portions: Good Ambiance: Poor (went on the weekend and was disappointed, especially considering all the restaurants around the place were bustling)  I ordered the grilled Atlantic Salmon which wasn't really special. However the fish was moist and not over cooked. For the price, I would expect better food quality."}
{"text":"I've actually been to this restaurant twice in the last month. I didn't get a chance to write a review last time.   I made a visit to this lovely restaurant on Feb 5 for Winterlicious. My mom likes the whole shop and eat experience so this was her b-day lunch.   I enjoy the decor in this restaurant and the service is always friendly.   Now for the food. To start I had the Haddock and Yukon Gold fritters which were delish. I love a good fish cake! My mom had the Cream of Cauliflower soup with Gouda and bacon. Also very delish.   Now our appetizers arrived very promptly however there was a very significant wait for our main course. I wasn't in a hurry but I think it would have been nice if our waiter had of addressed this rather than smiling and filling up our water glasses constantly.   When our main courses arrived we were very please and very hungry! My mom had the Bavarian Weisswurst with mash and kraut and I had the Salmon with Dirty Rice and tiny Cajun shrimp. My salmon was good but the Weisswurst was amazing! Totally regretted my choice afterwards.   Dessert was good. Black Forest Torte for mom and Bread and Butter pudding for me. I found the cranberries on the pudding a little to tart for my liking.   I gave this review 4 stars because overall this restaurant is great. My previous visit was even better. I highly recommend their mac and cheese. True comfort food."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch Nice place Ordered a quick sandwich. Was tasty. Good service"}
{"text":"Consistently good restaurant from a perspective relative to location. Wide selection within menu with changing specials that usually sound pretty good. From apps, to pastas, to pizzas, to desserts, I've tried many of the dishes and most are pretty good. Not much to say but is exactly what it is, A-OK."}
