{"text":"Excellent service & great atmosphere. My Tagliatelle Ragu was so delicious. The braised  lamb and beef were cooked perfectly. My mom had the risotto and she also loved it. She said it's one of the best she's had. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Have been twice....once for dinner and once for brunch. 

Fantastic brunch at very reasonable prices. Had the eggs Benedict with beef cheeks. Very good and nice to see a different take on a Benny breakfast.

Great addition to the hood."}
{"text":"Luv luv luv this place!  The people were so welcoming and friendly.  I had the TAGLIATELLEÂ RAGU and CAPPUCCINO and while I was waiting warm fresh bread and the best hummus I've ever had!   Absolutely amazing food, atmosphere and service!  The best restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is so lovely: the food is always perfectly delicious. The best chicken beast to be had. Ditto halibut with tapenade. Mediterranean simplicity and flavour. I won't bore you with inept descriptions, but we've not had anything that wasn't delicious. It's our favourite new place, superior food to the more known places east of here, in an unpretentious atmosphere with friendly service. So pleased to have found this find in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My gosh, it was the best cappuccino I've ever had! Great food and great drinks. We ordered the shrimp feta app and that was amazing. Then I got the Ragu which was just as amazing. I loved the quiet music they played, I felt like I was in Italy on a relaxing afternoon. Would definitely come back here and I'm bringing my family."}
{"text":"Great food, great music and great people. Their homemade burger is the best in Toronto! Ciabatta bun is so fresh. I was so full at the end of this dish and can't wait to try again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants. Always have the Tagliatelle Ragu. It is simple but very flavourful and reasonably priced. 

Overall very good food and will be back!"}
{"text":"A real gem in a fabulous neighbourhood. Hard to choose what to have as all dishes are wonderful. If you are a lamb fan the shank doesn't get any better. Appetizers are a meal in themselves. Go often and try everything."}
{"text":"This was a nice find. We came here in the late afternoon for lunch. We were kind of skeptical at first because the restaurant was empty but we decided to give it a shot. 
And we are glad we did. We had the duck   prosciutto sandwich and a pasta. Both of the dishes were top notch. Full of flavour, nicely balanced and well portioned. 
Service was great as the waiter was attentive without being all up in your face."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a laid-back upscale environment and no massive crowd for Sunday Brunch, this is the place to go!! It's really new, so that's probably why no line. Amazing service, incredible food and great prices! 

Last Sunday we were looking for brunch in our neighbourhood (St Clair and Dufferin) and the regular brunch spots all had 20-25 minute wait times for a table for 3. I remember seeing this place while on the streetcar home and we ended up walking in and immediately being greeted by our awesome server and getting a table with no wait. 

Service was quick and food was amazing. I had 2 eggs, over medium with potatoes and homemade breakfast sausage. All was great! Husband had Eggs Benny with beef cheeks over potato pancakes and an espresso. He couldn't stop raving about the meal and how tender the meat was. His cousin, visiting from Holland, had the vegetarian omelet with salad and he was definitely happy. We also had a plate of fries with garlic aioli to share and they have feta cheese on them!!! OMG it was soooo good! I'd come back just to have those again. Then for dessert, we tried the flourless chocolate cake which, as someone with a gluten allergy, I can tell you is just ridiculous. It's so dense, so intensely chocolatey and definitely needs to be shared. I don't think I've had a better flourless chocolate cake in Toronto. 

We left satisfied and pretty much had to roll us out of there. Will definitely be back for brunch and to check out the dinner menu! Give these guys a try. New but worth it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. The food is incredibly delicious and high end quality, beats any restaurant in the area and actually most in Toronto. I would eat there everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Warm, cozy, inviting. Simple eggs and handmade sausages; I didn't know they could be so simple yet so delicious. 
Going back. Bring your friends. This place deserves a line up outside. 
Thanks for the great service and simply delicious food!"}
{"text":"It is not often that I encounter a restaurant that offers such a complete dining experience. Barista & Chef offers diners of the Oakwood and St. Clair area a dining experience that is executed so vibrantly and brilliantly that keeps his customers coming back for more! 

Barista & Chef feels to me like a communal dining experience, that supports and promotes a sense of community and growth for the Oakwood and St. Clair neighbourhood by inviting people to break bread together, experience good service and feel inspired to eat food that is delicious and artfully made.

As a regular diner of Barista & Chef, I have had the opportunity to enjoy many of the dishes offered on the menu, always with a sense of adventure, as it if I was trying them for the first time. One week it may be the rainbow trout with a citrus salad and roasted potatoes. On my next visit, it may be the lamb shank served with scallop potatoes that are to die for. While on a more indulging mood, the homemade burger just hits the spot!

And just went you thought you could not ask for more! a melody fills you as you take the first bite of your favorite dish and there it is Chet Baker in the background,  it is music that captivates you, lets you take in the flavours and aromas so intensely that you can't help but feel that you have been transported to a very special place.  

At Barista & Chef you feel like a guest, as Hednor walks you to the door and thanks you for your visit. A smile always feels like the right way to end the evening, Barista and Chef are experts at making your dining experience superb!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant and menu, more than a casual setting, however it is not good enough to celebrate special occasions. Good service, understandably when the place is packed, service is slower; food quality is inconsistent, sometimes it is delicious, other times it is nothing to rave about. Beware of ordering daily specials, or adding protein to your salad, as they tend to overcharge. If you live on a budget, I suggest inquiring about the price before the order."}
{"text":"Though immaculate and well presented this wonderful restaurant suffers from appearing relatively nondescript and I feel therefore doesn't get the attention it deserves. The service was excellent, the atmosphere incredibly comfortable and the food delicious. Very reasonably priced, this place is easy to walk past but definitely worth the visit, and return visit."}
{"text":"What a nice experience to discover this great place
The food was excellent. The ambiance warm and inviting, the service was perfect
A nice place to enjoy a nice relaxing evening as a couple or with friends
I had the grilled peppers with feta and didnt leave a crumb behind:)
I had the three cheese pasta which i loved
The seafood plate was to die for too
Im looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"Came here again for brunch with the Hubster and his parents. We ordered the chef's omelette, egg and sausage breakfast, eggs Benedict and trout sandwich. I actually had my eye on the duck prosciutto sandwich, but was told that without the dairy, it would be a bit dry and bland. I took the recommendation and was handsomely rewarded with a perfectly cooked trout with grilled vegetables on a crusty bun. I struggled to finish it and had to leave most of the bread behind. Everyone else enjoyed their meals very much. My MIL couldn't finish the omelette and my FIL raved about the beef cheeks in the eggs Benedict, which he had never had before. The Hubster told me that the sausage was amazing, AFTER he finished all of it.

The great thing about this spot is that it was mysteriously deserted at Saturday at noon. The brunch was fantastic for its value (nothing over $15), service was great and the space is very comfortable. I would definitely visit again for brunch, a meal that I usually avoid because I hate the Toronto brunch crowds."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch and dinner and have been pleasantly surprised every time. Consistently good food. One of the best restaurants on St Clair and definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I come every other week so this review was long overdue. It's a very cozy place, nice music, outstanding service and of course delicious, delicious food. I've tried a few options and my favourite so far is the Rainbow Trout. I could eat this dish every single day. Also, they serve bread with hummus (at no charge) while you wait. This place is a MUST try."}
{"text":"So, we just happened to stumble across this restaurant because the restaurant we actually wanted to go to a few doors down was closed.  And I couldn't be more happy. Our experience was delightful.  From the appetizers to the main meals, everything was delicious. Our server was amazing.  So glad we found this place.  Will definitely revisit and would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I called and requested a 7:15 reservation for a Saturday night for 4 people but was advised there was only a table available at 6:30. We were not happy about the early hour, but took the time slot.  How shocked were we when we arrived only to find approximately half the tables were empty and remained so up to the time we left around 9:00 p.m.  if this is the way they treat customers, only accepting a reservation if you come early in the evening (which is preferable for an over 80 year old demographic), they won't stay in business long term. Just for the record, this is the second time we have had this experience, but it will be the last."}
{"text":"I cant say enough good things about this place. The restaurant itself is a little unassuming but should not deter you from trying the food. I went with four people and every dish we had was amazing from just a simple burger to an luxurious mushroom/beef ragu pasta. The owners were very welcoming and friendly and the glass of warm brandy completed a great experience."}
{"text":"Last Saturday my friend and I found this little restaurant by coincidence trying to find a place to get warm and we loved it. We ordered dessert and a coffee Americano and everything was good. The staff was incredible helpful very attentive and professional even though we didn't order food we couldn't help ourselves to notice that the food being served to other customers looked so appetizing that we decided to give it a try next time."}
{"text":"This hidden subtle gem on St. Clair west of Bathurst is the most intimate, charming, classy place I have been to for dinner in years!  As a first timer, I was greeted at my table by the owner with a glass of champagne!  The service was professional, friendly and attentive.  The bread was served warm and fresh, and the main course was delicious and attractively presented.  The prices are reasonable but it was the attentive, personalized service that truly sold me on this place.  I can't wait to go back and experience it again.  Intimate, attentive and personalized! Although it is late Nov.  I see the patio and look forward to experiencing their service and food el fresco next summer!"}
{"text":"Intimate place, warm ambiance, delicious food, polite service... I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this local place...best in the neighbourhood. Try the Rainbow Trout!!"}
{"text":"Go to this place!!! It's so great, and their brunch is stellar... eggs benny with a side of braised beef cheek!"}
{"text":"My home close to home,my kitchen with a chef, my hangout.I love it here. Always great food and comfortable atmosphere. Summer patio.Friendly and engaging staff. Great brunch also."}
{"text":"An absolute. With line ups everywhere else on St Clair, dropped in here for brunch and was absolutely blown away, top class food, service and delicious coffee. This place is in a league of its own!"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times. The server or barista guy thats always there is really friendly and the service is great. They have great selection of wines for all price ranges. I've always loved the food here but the first time I was there, they had a pistacio crusted tuna steak on special. It was absolutely incredible I wish they had it on the menu always. Really great place for a nice night out with a loved one or family."}
{"text":"What a terrific place! My wife and I came here for her birthday and we were very pleasantly surprised. The service was terrific, we had the Mediterranean platter for the appetizer, I had the tagliatelle with shrimp and my wife had the crepes. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. I had a nice glass of Black Label Shiraz that complemented my entrÃ©e nicely. 

The only negative is the decor is not up to the quality of the food and the service. Not a dealbreaker at all but ambience counts for a lot - so four stars."}
{"text":"A hidden gem of a restaurant. Some of the freshest and visually appealing dishes I've seen in a while. Their seafood dishes worth travelling for. Seared tuna w pistachio and above all their pear salad with candied walnuts...worth every penny. 
Above all, great atmosphere...soft music and lighting accompanies the meal in a clean and warmly furnished restaurant with wood , cream and neutral colours. I know where I will be hosting my next bday party!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! 

Came here on a Friday night and had a reservation although it wasn't really necessary; there were maybe only 2 other tables seated. The restaurant is really pretty and quaint, it's a nice place for a date! The food is also great! 

This restaurant, hidden among one of the many places on St. Clair, is a hidden gem. The interior is really lovely, warm and inviting. It's quite a small place so I'd be hesitant to bring large groups, but it's nice for a small family/friends gathering or a date. It's dimly lit and quite romantic. 

Once we sat down, we had our drink orders taken and were brought some bread. The drinks and bread came out quickly but it was about 10-15 minutes before the waiter came back to take our orders which was a bit long but we weren't in a rush so it wasn't a big deal. They have a nice selection of wine, a glass will run around $10-11. The bread they bring out is delicious, I'm seeing here that it's a bean-type dip but the waitress said it was hummus, regardless, it was garlicky and delicious, we got a second helping of that. I ordered the b&c pasta which is a cheesy, creamy pasta with duck prosciutto and pears. We also got the eggplant Parmesan and the Gorgonzola and pear salad to start. Both were above average and the plating was really beautiful. Again, the food does take a while to come out so I wouldn't come here if I was in a rush. I also tried a bit of the ragu pasta which was also very good. 

Portion sizes are generous and the food was served hot and tasted fresh. My pasta was really rich but it had some sweetness from the pears which was nice and unique. 

The restaurant is supposed to be Mediterranean but I found it to be closer to an Italian restaurant, although the dishes had some creative spins to them. I'm not sure what the focus or theme is but, because of the variety, I think that everyone could probably find something suitable on the small menu. 

The service was decently good, I think there were some moments that could have been improved upon. When we walked in, we were kind of just stared at. The server seemed kind of indifferent when we showed up. Also when I was placing my order I noticed he was looking away from me at one point and it seemed like he wasn't paying attention to what I was saying which was strange. There were really no issues with the service other than those tiny things, I might be nit-picking but it caught me off guard in such a nice restaurant. I actually think the server might have been the owner, he seemed to be making sure everything was running smoothly. 

Prices are mid-range. I think they're fair given the location and quality of the food. The pastas are around $14-20 and then the meat dishes were $20+. Nothing too crazy but probably not a budget dinner.

I would definitely be back to try other menu items as I had a nice time here and left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"We came here for a snack as I was shopping in the area. Both of us ordered the fries. After receiving our drinks we received a plate of fresh, warn bread & homemade hummus. Delicious!

Then our fries came after & it was dressed with sprinklings of green onion & feta cheese with a side of a creamy sauce. I wasn't expecting this & since I'm lactose intolerant I scraped the cheese off the fries & gave them to hubby even though they offered to make a plate without dairy. 

Long story short the fries were hand cut & obviously homemade. They were scrumptious. We would eat here again when we're next in the area. The decor is modern & classy yet casual. The owner told us they just opened a few months ago."}
{"text":"Honestly my boyfriend and I come here every week and we just love it here. They've got really good food and the presentation. I strongly recommend the lamp and the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, which is surely the BEST in the city. Trust me I have tried so many deserts in so many places. The decor here also gives off a relaxing and refined vibe and atmosphere that makes you wanna linger. The service is great and the owner is nice. Anyway awesome dinning experience I have every time"}
{"text":"My date (mom) and I shared the Mediterranean platter and a roast beet salad with goat cheese. Great service, very nice and well seasoned food. All in all a lovely experience."}
{"text":"I went to Barista & Chef for the first time on Saturday for brunch/lunch based on the positive reviews on Yelp and wow, am I glad that I did! I went with my husband and 12 month-old (I emailed beforehand to make sure that they had a high-chair and they were extremely accommodating). I cannot rave enough about how amazing it was. As other reviewers have mentioned it was quiet (only one other family and a single guy) so the service was fast and the waitress was very attentive. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and the family at the other table actually struck up a conversation with us (it was friendly, not awkward at all). I had the Eggs Benedict and my husband had the chicken sandwich. These choices sound fairly mundane but they were the most delicious eggs Benedict that I've ever eaten. Each bite had me moaning! My husband felt the same way about his chicken sandwich (that had roasted red pepper and the most delicious sauce imaginable).  We will be going back! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Just good food in a real restaurant at very reasonable prices."}
