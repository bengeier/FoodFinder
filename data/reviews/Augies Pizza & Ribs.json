{"text":"Best pizza in Royalton! Prefer New York Style the best, but this is still good pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious thick pizza and their spaghetti is amazing too. I've eaten here countless times, and it's always the best quality"}
{"text":"Looking for a family friendly place to eat in with booths... you'll enjoy Augie's Pizza & Ribs. These owners often come and meet you at your table too! My favorite is mama D's homemade dressing on any salad and the homemade lasagna. The presentation is great too!   I've been ordering for catering, for home and at day job, from this establishment for years. Pans of lasagna, sheet pizzas, rigatoni...and the like... I wouldn't hesitate to recommend!!"}
{"text":"Called a couple of weeks ago to inquire about ordering food for some staff meetings and had some questions regarding their catering menu. The woman who answered the phone transferred me to a gentleman named Joey, who could not have been nicer.  He was friendly, patient, and answered all of my questions, and even offered some ideas on what to order.  I was very impressed and in a world where it seems like great customer service has disappeared, it was refreshing to talk to someone interested in making his customer happy...big thanks to Joey @ Augies!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! All the toppings smothered in a lovely layer of cheese!"}
{"text":"Good Place For Wings & Ribs  I'm not a pizza fan.  But I discovered that Augie's has some of the best wings and ribs the way I like them.  The wings are bone-in, cooked extra crispy, plain, with sauce on the side.  Not many places offer the crispy wings and plain with sauce on the side.  Their ribs have the right amount of sauce and are cooked well.  They are 'fall off the bone' tender and every order I've had were excellent cuts.  I would certainly recommend Augie's for wings and ribs.  I don't know about their pizza.  I've never had it."}
{"text":"I have ATTEMPTED to order from Augies 2 times now.  the first was on a Sunday around 2pm........was told they dont start delivering till 4pm.......didnt order that time.  the second time was this past weekend.  I called Sunday to order a small pizza.......was told i needed to order $15 worth of food to get it delivered.....needless to say i have not tried this place nor do i have the desire to.  Why make it so difficult to get a pizza delivered?"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the area.  Everything on the menu is worth trying.  Personally I enjoy the pizza and wings.  The BBQ wings are by far the best I've ever had from a pizza place.  The wings are just as good if not better than Bdubs or Quaker Steak.  The pizza is filling cheesy greasy and delicious.  Augies is rather expensive compared to pizza chains such as Marcos zeppes papajohns etc.  A large pizza is around $15, wings are $8 per dozen.  They have a few coupons that are pretty much worthless and might save ya a dollar at best.  As previously mentioned the pizza is greasy and is definitely not on the healthy side of pizza (assuming there is a healthy pizza out there such as California pizza kitchen)  Overall I recommend you give Augies a try, especially the pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Homemade - quick service and reasonable.  Besides Pizza we also get their chicken parm and meatball subs - Delicous."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza for the first time from Augies. We really enjoyed it. The best that I've had in North Royalton. I would've given 5 stars but when you charge 2 bucks per extra toppings you should have more than one tiny piece on each slice."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the Meaty Beaty. Cheese didn't even try to stick to the dough. Sausage was the consistency and flavor of tiny sponges. Overall a disaster. Which is odd, because we ate in once before and the food was good. I'd try them again, just not the pizza."}
{"text":"Augies offers wonderful pizza (dine-in/take out/delivery) as well as a competitive family restaurant.  Augies was one of our favorites for pizza growing up due to their unique technique of burying pizza ingredients underneath the cheese.  It really changes the taste and seems to lock in a lot of the flavor.  It also makes for an awesome left over pizza.  I can taste this in my mouth as I type this!  Augies uses a good blend of ingredients, some fresh, some not, but overall it's a good pizza and one of my favorites  Good family atmosphere establishment.  The Jenks are a wonderful family with a talent and skill for operating this business."}
{"text":"stopped for dine in a while back, nice atmosphere and decent food.  Only question is why do so many pizza places anymore, dice all the toppings into teeny-tiny tidbits, feels like I'm at an Amish Country salad bar (they do the same thing) or assisted living facility.  Would prefer nice cuts and chunks of peppers, onion, on the pie.......not teeny-tiny diced.  They do have options, so pay attention when you order."}
{"text":"For as inexpensive as this pizza was, it was phenomenal! Friendly, prompt service and delicious pizza for one small price. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food but they stopped taking American Express and that's all I carry.  Can't do company events or eat there anymore.  Such an inconvenience."}
