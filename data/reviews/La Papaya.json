{"text":"friendly staff, LOVE the energetic & dietary natural juices!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the workers are shady!!!Their website shows a special for a free water when you buy a torta. When I asked for my free water they said that their website isn't updated & that it's an old special. Then I saw daily specials on their counter when I asked about that the worker said, \"oh those are old too\"."}
{"text":"This sandwich, crepe and juice spot on the corner of Russell and Pecos was a great surprise! This shopping center is coming back with an EOS fitness, antique mall, bar, and a few other spots to eat, but make it a point to grab a sandwich or crepe from La Papaya. Upon first entering, I was genuinely welcomed by a woman behind that counter that said she was there if I had any questions. There was a customer sitting with his grandson that quickly suggested for me to try a chocolate, strawberry and banana crepe and said that he had only found this place two days ago and had been back twice. I now understand why. I chose to grab a turkey sandwich and a Cuban sandwich to go. Both sandwiches were amazing! The Cuban wasn't traditional nevertheless delicious. The flavors used and the bread are what set this spot a part from competeters. I also liked that they automatically gave me jalapenos and extra sauce on the side. I highly suggest!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located right next to my gym. After a pretty rigorous workout, a friend and I decided to come in and check the place out in order to refuel.   Indoor and outdoor seating is available. The restaurant itself is pretty clean. They promote healthy options, which is great considering that they are right next to the gym.   My friend and I ordered chicken paninis, a salad, and a nutella crepe. We didn't think the portions would be big, but they were and it was a lot of food for the two of us. We did finish it, though. We also ordered agua frescas, which were pretty refreshing.   The customer service was great. The employees interacted with us and also offered us a sample of one of their smoothies. I am lactose intolerant, so I asked them if there is milk in their smoothie/agua frescas and they assured me that there is not. They blend drinks with water or orange juice. They also have almond milk available, but of course you need to let them know beforehand if you want it.   Overall, I was impressed. The food was really good and I would go back for a post-workout meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing there fresh juices are amazing after the gym and there salads and spinach wraps are so delicious yet healthy but even though I go for the amazingly healthy food and juices there crepes are like a work of art, and made right in front of you! They even will make you a protein gluten free crepe with your choice of toppings this place is right next to my gym ( EOS ) and perfect for an after workout healthy boost! They truly are a hidden gem in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place after a workout last week, been back 3 times all ready. Portions are big enough and menu is full of fresh and healthy options. Staff and atmosphere is friendly and quaint. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path this diner is excellent with fresh juices, smoothies and simple foods. I had the Verde juice and it was refreshing and delicious. They also had sandwiches and soups and deserts that looked wonderful was well. Good clean drink to wash away all the Vegas strip foods."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out this place since it first opened, especially since I'm constantly at the E?S gym right next door. However, I'm rating this place a 1 star only because every SINGLE time I've stopped by to try it out, they've been closed or \"closing early.\" This is the 3rd time I've came an hour to an hour and a half before their closing time which is 9pm (stated on Yelp, their website, and on their store front) and they're closed an hourly early once again. Really disappointing!"}
{"text":"A little over priced for the food they offer. Calling itself a Deli may be a bit much. But it's nice and clean inside, tries to be hip, and a fair amount of menu options. It's a decent sandwich shop that only loses points due to cost."}
{"text":"IT'S 7:24pm walked up and the they said they were closed already!!!! This is my second time attempting to try this place out!!! Everytime they're closed!! CALL before coming make sure they're in the mood to work. According to Yelp they close at 11. Not true."}
{"text":"This location is near Eos fitness and my dad and I stop in here often. The counter girls are always very nice and welcoming and everything ive had here has tasted fresh and delicions. Not to mention its a healthier option after the gym with fruit juices and smoothies. I REALLY like this place and am glad to see it succeeding. They also have a outdoor eating area and they are very clean."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service! We will be back very soon!! The paninis are tasty and the smoothies taste great too!"}
{"text":"Super cute and lots of variety! Crepes and sandwiches and smoothies and coffee. They have it all! I had the Gym Nut milk shake and it was super tasty! It was like horchata with whey protein. I recommend it after a hard gym sesh!"}
{"text":"Yesterday (Monday) was my first time going to this restaurant. I go to the gym in the same shopping center. I wanted something healthy after working out and saw this shop. The exterior is clean. When I entered, the interior was spotless. I was greeted with smiles from everyone. They said \"Hello and welcome.\" They promptly were ready to take my order although they were clearly busy. I told them it was my first time and wanted to browse the menu. One of the ladies went over the menu with me and told me to just let her know when I was ready. I ordered an agua fresca made with mango and watermelon. Completely refreshing. The employee told me to taste if before I left so if she could see if she needed to adjust the sweetness. Great experience. Today (Tuesday) I decided to go back again. This time I ordered an avocado omelette and another agua Fresca. It was amazing. Omelette came with this spicy orange sauce that really complemented everything on the omelette.  They serve: crepes, coffee, omelette, natural juice, smoothies, oatmeal, sandwiches, tortas, salads, soups, paninis, milkshakes, juice shots, and agua Fresca. Amazing menu selection.  And they deliver for free within 2 miles for orders over $10."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food, fresh as fuck juice. What else could you want? Wait is sometimes a little long but it's because they make everything to order. They are always super friendly. If you haven't tried this place you need to."}
{"text":"My whole order was wrong, from drink to food, they over charged me, & just thought it was okay. Food wasn't that great as well. The agua fresca was good, but unfortunately they made too many mistakes for me to want to come back."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I could. Customer service was non existent. Sandwich was blahh. Waste of money."}
{"text":"I love this place the employees are super friendly and their food is really good! So far I have tried their fresh juices and I'm in love the large is only $5! Their buffalo chicken panini was delicious with the perfect amount of spice. Today I went for something new and gave their Crepes a try and oh my goodness I am in love! This neighborhood definitely need it something fresh like this, I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"This place is very clean and the women that work there are very friendly. I ordered the tostilocos. It's a great portion and super tasty. The only complaint I had was the wait. There were 2 other people already eating and no one ahead of me and it still took about 10 minutes for me to get my food. Other than that, it's not a bad place."}
{"text":"The staff is great very friendly the place is very very clean they have Panini's and crepes, salad and some Mexican goodies !!!! Gold!!!!"}
{"text":"Greek salad add avacado, very fresh very delicious, I will be back soon, to try a smoothie,or juice concoction."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, refreshing, all the things! I loved it, they encouraged me to get the Tuna torta since they had just made the tuna, that was delicious, and the special was a torta and large agua fresca, I got the mango. OH WOW! It was like I was eating a mango, but in this liquid magic form that was refreshing too. Such sweet ladies, great experience."}
{"text":"Las mejores crepas de Nutella que he comido. muy buen servicio, las chicas muy amables. super recomendable lugar"}
{"text":"This little Deli place just opened around the corner from my house. It's tucked behind some building so its kinda hard to see. I got the Cuban sandwich and it was fantastic. They also do coffee, crepes, and juices. Definitely worth checking out.  Trying this place out again. They had a special where you get a free drink with the purchase of a sandwich, which I got last time I came. This time they said they won't give me the drink because that offer was over a month ago. But... I was here 4 days ago and got it, and the sign is still up. Same 2 people wHmmm"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Great healthy smooth options and the sandwiches are good too!!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying this healthy deli. I loved the atmosphere! As soon as you walk in your greeted with a warm welcome. They have so many options. Not only was it delicious it's reasonably priced! Definitely coming back!   (I had the tuna panini with the strawberry Agua Fresca)"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I got The Doctor all natural green juice & a chicken southwest salad with an amazing homemade chipotle sauce!! Staff is super friendly and helpful. Definitely will be back. Great post workout meals and drinks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to EoS and decided to try this place and so glad we did! The service is top notch, the food is very fresh and the smoothies super yummy! I definitely recommend the cuban panini which is fantastic and the hulk smoothie! This is our 4th time visiting this place and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Had a tasty panini and fresh juice.  Wasn't a big fan of chic soup....but the crepes looked AMAZING.  Will be back to eat again soon, try a crepe and a coffee drink."}
{"text":"Really friendly service. Lots of great healthy lunch options, also they do homemade soup which was delicious (broccoli/cheddar). Chicken pesto panini had good flavor and texture, solid sammy. They also do a ton of specialty drinks and agua frescas that you can mix and match flavor. Overall great lunch spot, great value"}
{"text":"I love coffee and I love cajeta, but this two put together is even better!!! The food is freshly made once you order it!!! Everyone is super friendly and willing to give you opinions on what you should try!!  I love this place!!! I will so be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for all.  I love their green juices and wraps while my child loves their crepes! Love being a regular here."}
{"text":"I ordered a Hawaiian pulled pork and it came with almost no pork. Very small portions. Every other pulled pork sandwich I've had has pork falling out of the sides. When coming back I received a very unwelcoming look from the male employee with braces. I'm not coming back and won't recommend it. They shouldn't give the (death stare) to any customer. And they should boost their meat portions."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. Smells sooo good as soon as you walk in.  Huge selection of fresh juices and smoothies. I had the doctor which has: Spinach,kale,parsley, ginger,wheat grass, lime and flat seed. Wow. It was phenomenal. Tasted amazing and cured my hunger."}
{"text":"Since I first tried this place I have been back at least three times for more! The food is fresh and delicious. The creps are some of my favorite around town. The shakes and fresh water drinks are really tasty, fresh, and served in a giant cup. The employees are nice and friendly. The restaurant is filled with natural light and feels welcoming. They sometimes have latin music playing. I'm a happy customer and I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"So disappointing...  Prices seemed bit high for some things.  Had a Cuban Torta which looked ok but had no flavor.  They put it in a panini press grill but it was not toasted seemed like was only to give it the panini ridges look.  All though they had bout 4 or five single serve chips bags types I was not offered a choice the girl opened the bag poured half out and that what you get.  Also ordered a Strawberry Shake, it too had no flavor.  Over all was disappointed in food.  The place was very clean and lady behind counter very nice and friendly.  But not worth a return visit for me."}
{"text":"Very exquisite place. Phenomenal customer service! Loved the atmosphere. And the food you may ask? Beyond amazing!!  We had strawberry and banana crepes and omg, delish. And the hazelnut latte was beyond my expectations. It discovered a new taste bud, and I love Starbucks lol.  2 thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"One meal and I'm hooked!  Great food, super fresh, and completely affordable too!   AND it's organic!  That's unheard of!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite places ever!!!! I always end up ordering the sandwiches and the juices and it tastes so fresh. You can tell they care about what they put in the food. The people are really nice, and I have a good experience every time I go.  The prices are reasonable too! I think it's perfect!!"}
