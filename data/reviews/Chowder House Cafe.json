{"text":"The building and artwork look great(has since it was Jimmys place), but the food doesn't live up to the look and feel of the building at all.   The pulled pork barbecue tastes similar to what you would expect from McDonalds if they served pulled pork.  The sauce has enough sugar in it to induce a coma and the sandwich has so much sauce in it you can barely taste the pork.  The menu is very minimal to start out with, but when I went there for lunch it seemed like most of the items weren't available.  Overall, it was a really disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We just had lunch and enjoyed every bite.  The lobster bisque was rich and filling and who could eat a bowl?  I had the fish tacos, Joan had the Ahi with noodles and perfect is the only word that fits.  I saw a kobe burger go by and was amazed by the size!  I will fill my wine bag and head back very soon with Glen in tow.  How exciting to have an artsy little place to visit.  I will take out of town guests too!"}
{"text":"They are a little bit over pricey, for what they have. Parking is a big inconvenience you have to park almost behind the building or across the street in cvs parking. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars because the atmosphere was great and the clam chowder was delicious. However, my girlfriend and I waited up front for at least 5 minutes while waiting to be seated and the food was a little over priced. Our waitress was very friendly and we enjoyed our visit. I'm guessing its worth stopping in during the busy lunch/dinner hours, but in between (when we came 3-4pm) is not the ideal time for service."}
{"text":"The staff was wonderful! We were on a time crunch & the chef accidentally fell behind missing our order so we had to ask for it to go, he gave us our meals free for his mistake... Really, we were surprised for such generosity & it was very yummy, had a salad (tho, a little dressing heavy)"}
{"text":"Honestly this place has been one of our favorites in the area.  We were never disappointed.  Had I wrote this review a year ago it would of been 5 stars.     Something has happened however in the last year+.  The food quality has just gone down hill badly.   I think we're done with this place.  My pasta was cold dried out and hard on the edges ..like heat lamp hard ... friends burger came with nothing on it ..they forgot to put stuff on it ...  twisted noodles, always one of our favorites was just not right, and they made lots of emergency substitutions for the things that were supposed to be in the dish as stated by the menu.  Ran out of like 3 entree's on the menu as well .. on a Wed night?  I must say the service has been bad the last few visits as well.  Waitress just disappears.  Get what you want when you see them because they don't come back except to give you the check when your done.  Ran out of water .. couldn't get cheese for pasta.    This place has potential.  Like I said ... maybe I've just been hitting them on off nights lately .. different cook or something... but it's just happened too often for me to want to go back.    They do let you bring your own wine and uncork for a fee.  I still do like that."}
{"text":"Thank goodness Red Lobster was a 45min wait or we wouldn't have found this gem!  I was so in the mood for seafood.  And this did not disappoint.    The ambience reminds me of when I lived out west and the service was friendly and pretty timely for a Friday night.    The lobster bisque was amazing - pretty much everything we got there was.  They have quite the variety as well.   We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here once for brunch It was OK. They were out of a few things on the menu. I had the lobster omelet with asparagus- it was good. The potatoes we're cold. The ciabatta toast was really good. Also, the apple wood bacon was smokey and delicious.  The coffee was also above average.  The bathroom is kinda shabby and could use good cleaning.  The service was good.  I would definitely try this place for dinner."}
{"text":"Have visited the Chowder House on several occasions. This trip I had the Wedge Salad to start and the Ahi TunaTwisted Noddles as my dinner. It was excellent! My wife had the side salad with the White French Dressing and the Shrimp and Lobster Tacos. Very good!  We will be back again. Groupons are a great value."}
{"text":"Torn between a 3 and 4 star, and I bumped it up to 4 because I saw a review for 1 star due to them not accepting credit cards. Psshhh. Never go to Pittsburgh then. The best breakfast places in the city, Pamela's and DeLuca's, are cash-only.  Back to the topic! This was fine. Not great, not bad. We had four people in our group. One person got both the lobster bisque and the chowder to compare. He preferred the chowder, as he noted the bisque was more watery than the chowder. Another got a salad that was also fine, and someone also got one of their fish sandwiches. The sandwich was good but I personally was unimpressed by the appearance of the bun it came on. It looked like a pretty cheap bun, which was surprising considering their prices are Panera-level. My lunch was the Savannah's Best. The scallops in it were very good, however the overall dish was a little heavy for my taste. It seemed to depend overly on the amount of cream in the dish, but not on spices for flavor. We also had their fresh lemonade, which was very good and may go back to grab some desserts. They apparently make their desserts all in-house, and one of the options was a salted caramel cheesecake, which sounds divine. Overall, I wouldn't make it a point to eat here, but neither would I specifically avoid it if I was with people who wanted seafood. The server was very helpful and pleasant, and the decor is so fun. I did enjoy the personality of the place."}
{"text":"Me and my bf order clam chowder, lobster bisque, ahi salad and lobster roll. The place is very crowded. Even with a reservation, we waited for 15 minutes. The soups came first. The lobster bisque was too salty to drink. The clam chowder was okay but not enough potato and not hot enough. the main dishes taste pretty fresh. so overall it's okay. we are particularly disappointed in the soups."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening at The Chowder House. The lobster bisque was even better than the last time.  The wife had the chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes. The sandwich was good but the potatoes had cooled off.  I had the Kobe burger with blue cheese. The burger was delicious and perfectly cooked. The blue cheese was kind of non existent so perhaps a different choice might have been wise.  The biggest concern of the evening was that the poor girl working the floor was a bit overwhelmed. She was greeting and seating as well as waiting the whole floor. It, combined with a few miscues by the kitchen, caused some of the other guests to get mixed orders.  None of these things would stop me from going to The Chowder House again. Their food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Sooo good. We had wedge salad with white french dressing, clam Chowda', crabcakes, seafood pappardelle ( from Buckeye Pasta). Fresh! Apparently they order the grouper and salmon in daily. They even get soft-shell Atlantic blue crab when in season. Definitely going back. Want to try the lobster bisque too.  Friendly staff. They split an order of seafood pappardelle three ways for us. Nice casual atmosphere, murals and art everywhere. We had no wait for seating, but recommend making reservations on the weekend. Bring your own wine."}
{"text":"My wife and her 3 friends ate here today for lunch.  They all ordered the Lobster roll.  They all stated that the roll itself was either overtoasted or stale.  No hint of Lobster in the sandwich.  They commented that it contained either shrimp or faux seafood.  They all have come here before but it is a consensus opinion that they will not be back.  Place is overpriced, with less than quality food today."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times and it's always great. The three little pigs is fantastic as is most everything on the menu. The place is fairly small so I would recommend reservations. Also of note, it's cash only and byob. Good for dinner and lunch though for lunch make sure you have some time if you choose to eat in."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by my experience at the Chowder House.  I ordered the Lobster Bisque and the Scallop Poboy.  First,  both were brought out to me at the same time and so I couldn't eat the Poboy while it  was super hot.  The Bisque was flourey as if the rue was not well mixed.  It lacked chunks of lobster that is traditionally found in bisques and had very little lobster present.  The sandwich was generously portioned with large scallops,  but the roumalaid overpowered the sandwich.  Further,  with such large scallops,  it ate more like a lobster roll rather than a sandwich. The scallops could have been cooked a little longer to bring a nice sear to them.  The texture was a bit mushy. Overall,  not very impressed and probably will not be returning.  The staff was very welcoming,  however and the decor is funky and fun. Also,  does not take debit/credit card!"}
{"text":"The portion sizes have drastically decreased, so I'm not so sure I find it to be worth the expense anymore. In addition, the last 2 out of 3 times I ordered the Twisted Noodles the \"pan seared ahi tuna\" was completely cooked through :( I'm not sure we'll be back, at least not for a while. I'm still giving it a 3 because the atmosphere is adorable and the wait staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I made an account just to review this place. I am feeling slightly guilty for finding inspiration from negativity however my husband and I were just so disappointed after eating lunch here.   The outside of the building is the main reason this place caught our eye. I though wow this place looks funky and cool, the kinda place that starts a restaurant because they are really passionate about food.  Their lunch menu is very small which doesn't really bother me because I'd rather have a few food items done right than a huge selection of so-so items. Unfortunately this was not the case. I ordered one of their fish sandwiches and my husband ordered the lobster roll. I was slightly put off by my side option being potato chips (for $12 I would hope for something better as my side) but I was optimistic that perhaps they were homemade chips. Needless to say I was very disappointed when I saw the chef open a bag of potato chips in the kitchen. They were the cheap ruffled potato chips that you could buy at the dollar store for next to nothing. (You can see into the kitchen from the dining areas) I was hoping okay maybe this fish sandwich will be large and on really nice homemade bread. But nope! It was so small and the bread was flat and squished down to nothing. I ate my sandwich in almost 3 bites. It tasted alright but the overall texture of the sandwich was pasty and gooey since the lettuce was warm and wilted, and fish is soft in general, paired with a deflated thin bun make for a unsatisfactory experience. I did like the sauce and the tomatoes though! Just a nice roll and anything but cheap potato chips for the side would have made me a happy customer! You can add Asian noodles as a side but its $3 extra that would have made my lunch $15!!! For a tiny sandwich and I'm sure the portion of noodles would have mirrored the sandwich and would have been small as well. Now I'm not saying that I need HUGE portions and to over eat, I just want a plate of food that is worth the price and looks like the person who prepared the food cares! I can understand price increase during hard economic times but try and make the food as best as possible with your restaurants budget to keep your customers coming back to support you."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time ordered a special, wasn't real pleased with the food. Came back to give it another try. Ordered clam chowder and seafood papperdelle off the regular menu. Again, disappointed. They brag about how there aren't potatoes in the chowder, which would be great, if there were some clams in there. $5 for a cup felt like a ripoff. The pasta in my meal was overdone and getting gluey, and the menu said three cheese sauce- one of which tasted like bleu... come on. Bleu cheese and seafood aren't a great pairing of flavors. The atmosphere is unique, but ultimately decieving... I don't think I'd bother coming back."}
{"text":"I would give the food three stars and the experience one star.  The menu was interesting and our food had good flavor....maybe a bit heavy on the salt on the lobster bisque.    The menu includes dishes that you would find at an \"upper middle\" type restaurant.  Starters and salads from $8-12 and entrees from high teens to twenties (didn't ask the price on the specials which included a steak dish which may have been higher)  The problem was the experience.  The menu doesn't match the atmosphere or the décor.   I called earlier in the day and reserved a table for 2.  When we arrived, a middle aged lady was less than welcoming and acted very \"put out\" by our arrival for our dinner reservation.  She didn't make eye contact, , talked to another employee and told us that they were we could sit over at one of the high top tables.  These tables were maybe 2 feet in diameter, and looked more appropriate for having a drink than eating a meal.  Our other choice was that she could put us in the \"side room\".    We were seated at a table in a room that was maybe 10x14 and our 2 seat table was crammed against a wall and the entry door to that room.  We received cold blasts or air every time that the front door was opened.  The back of the room opened directly into the dish room where we heard loud talking and clanging of dishes throughout our meal.  When we mentioned this to our waitress she did holler at the was crew to close the door, but within 5 minutes it was open again and remained open throughout our meal.  When the phone rang, there was a loud speaker that I think was right above our table.  Our waitress was friendly, and she did offer to move us back into the other room with the high top.  Service was attentive, but not amazing.  The décor is very quirky.   I don't mind quirky, but I prefer clean and \"tasteful\" quirky.  This place was neither.  The tables were ugly formica and the chairs were the cheap vinyl covered seats like you would find in a diner or Denny's.  Despite our experience, my husband left over a 20% tip saying that it wasn't the waitress' fault and it's Christmas!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a year ago and the clam chowder soup and my entree were delicious, but yesterday I returned and the clam chowder was pastey and over peppered and the crab crusted grouper was so soggy and over seasoned, It was gross. Didn't eat but two bites and the waitress never asked how everything was.  Even the French bread that comes with the soup was stale. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Very cool decor and atmosphere, but extremely limited menu and both times we were there, they were out of something we ordered. Also, a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant. It was my second and last visit. I had the lobster roll which did not appear to contain actual lobster, but imitation lobster. I also had the clam chowder that was good, but not any better than what you can get at a chain restaurant. The service was really, really slow. We didn't have a reservation and the place was half empty, yet they made us wait for table because in the hostess' words \"this place is going to be packed in 15 minutes from reservations.\" Well, I can tell you that never happened!  The prices were expensive and the food was not worth the cost. I try to eat local as much as possible and really wanted to like this place but I just can't get on board."}
{"text":"What a unique little place right here in the heart of Cuyahoga Falls!  Quirky, comfortable atmosphere...congenial wait staff...delicious, fresh, fair-priced fare!  I have had the pleasure of dining at Chowder House Cafe a number of times with different friends and family members, so shame on me for just getting around to writing a review.  First of all, if you like Lobster Bisque, New England Clam Chowder, and/or *authentic* French Onion Soup, you will *love* those served at Chowder House Cafe!  All are brought to the table steaming hot...something I especially like, in that some establishments serve their soups luke warm.  The bisque and chowder are chunky with fresh, succulent seafood.  The broth of the bisque has just a hint of sherry...outstanding!  And there's no potato-filler in the creamy chowder!  The French onion soup is covered with a blanket of the most delicious provolone, which has been baked until golden, but not until crispy and dry...another pet peeve I have with some other places.    All of the salads I've had at the Chowder House are wonderfully fresh and flavorful...served crispy cold...great dressings!  Love the white French, especially over The Wedge!  If you are in the mood for Asian, try the Twisted Noodles: Perfectly seared Ahi tuna over cold sesame noodles dressed in a yummy wasabi-based sauce...just the right amount of kick!  The Lobster Roll is fabulous...no skimping on the fresh, tender shrimp and lobster, for sure!  I had the Lasagna Bolognese for the first time on New Year's Eve...hearty, meaty sauce between layers of al dente pasta, topped with cheese!  Delish...definitely enough for more than one meal.  But, then again, the portions of most entrees at Chowder House are!  Which reminds me of the dish my son-in-law ordered on New Year's Eve, as well...Three Little Pigs.  Talk about a misnomer!!!  Ain't nothin' \"little\" about this dish!!!  The enormous, juicy pork chop is a meal in itself!  And the Cassoulet...pure comfort in a (BIG) bowl!  Chicken, sausage, veggies, cannelloni beans (which haven't been reduced to mush).  You may feel like you've been transported to a quaint little cafe in the heart of Paris eating this one!  The Braised Short Ribs are to die for!  The sauce, alone, will make you order this dish again!  Generally, we've not had room for dessert, but the couple I've had were yummy...especially the Tiramisu Cheesecake!  Get this, even if you order it to go!  Chowder House Cafe is not a five-star establishment, nor do they taut themselves as such.  What it is, though, is a privately owned and operated clean, beautiful little gem with colorfully painted walls and stained-glass windows, which serves fresh, delicious food at very reasonable prices.  And the fact that you may bring your own beer and wine, something which can double one's bill in most other restaurants, is a plus in itself!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the atmosphere great, but they need a disclaimer on the Escolar dish. I would never order it again because it made me ill. After researching the fish online, this is not an unusual occurrence. I agree that it tasted great, but not worth the after effects."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  We came for the soup and tried both the clam chowder and the lobster bisque.  The clam chowder was gray, gelatinous and heavily salted and peppered.  The bisque was much better.  For dinner, we had the lobster tacos and a dreadful $28 halibut special (overcooked halibut in partially cooked bacon) served on cold mashed potatoes.  The very disinterested waitress took the cold potatoes back to the kitchen and returned with a new plate of cold mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Neat funky environment. Excellent grouper special, served topped with crab cake and Cajun hollandaise sauce. Byob, $10 corkage fee for wine and $6 for beer."}
{"text":"Very good! Many items made from scratch and fish is cleaned there. The portions aren't too big. Everything was flavored well. Would def return."}
{"text":"Bought a coupon from groupon, but was told no soup that day after being seated. A chowder house with no soup? We are not going back there again, even the coupon was offered on groupon again."}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad here. Food is fresh and tasty. Staff is wonderful and the decor is like sitting inside a painting. cash or check only is a down side"}
{"text":"Wife and I went for the first time last night. We had crab cakes, tuna noodles, wedge salad, and the halibut special. Could not have been more pleased. One of the best White French dressings we have had. The corking fee is not a big deal. We took two bottles of wine for $ 40 that would have cost us much more if they served liquor. Cash or check is ok but I can understand if you are upset."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Chowder House Cafe a few weeks ago on a Friday evening.  The place is decorated so cute and I love the casual atmosphere with fairly high end food.  I tried the lobster bisque, which was really good...it wasn't the best I've had, but was still delicious.  For my entrée, I had the Mako shark special...that was absolutely delicious.  It was perfectly prepared and over steamed veggies with a slightly sweet sauce over the shark.  I liked that the menu stated that the shark was fished in a sustainable manner by line and hook as that is important to me.  The service was good and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best seafood around. Lobster bisque and crab cakes are outstanding.  Service is always great. Bring your own bottle if you wasn't wine. They only take cash or check, no credit cards."}
{"text":"This is truly as good as it gets.  We've had much better fish here than we had in the Boston area this summer.  Every time.  My favorite dish is the noodles and seared ahi.  Oh. My.  This has quickly become our favorite place in the Akron area to dine.  My husband & I were there last night and he said he wouldn't mind going again soon.  Little does he know that we'll be back next week with friends to celebrate his birthday.  We love the fact that we can take our own wine and for a small corkage fee ($5!) we can drink what we've brought.  The waitresses are all nice.  It's a wait from ordering to delivery, but oh so worth it.  Best ever.  Much better than its sister, Sugo."}
{"text":"Not the place for good seafood. My lobster bisque was gray and very heavily peppered. Both my wife & I thought it closer to biscuit & gravy than anything resembling seafood. My wife's Poorboy wasn't even on a baguette. Again over seasoned masking the taste of the seafood. My lobster roll was the worst I've ever had. Zero large pieces of lobster. The seafood was shredded and looked like it may have been langastinos but not lobster. However the seasoning overpowered the seafood and tasted like celery.   What a waste. I left wondering if the cook had any formal training or had ever been to New England for real seafood. Additionally there is almost no parking and the decor is more Caribbean or voodoo Cajun. What's with that for a chowder shack."}
{"text":"I can only speak to our experience on one particular night.  It was very busy due to a recent Groupon offer which may have affected both the service and the food.  The hostess and our waiter were polite but not at all warm and definitely not inviting.   In fact, upon entering the restaurant we were promptly asked if we had a reservation and, rather than being apologetic that there wasn't room to seat us indoors, we were treated as if we were in their way.  We ordered the lobster bisque - very thick, very little flavor other than a strong dose of sherry.  I think they literally took the clam chowder and added sherry to it.  There were some good chunks of lobster in it - but absolutely flavorless.  I had a very hard time believing the stellar review found on here of the bisque. One of us ordered the lobster roll - literally chopped lobster and shrimp in mayo.  The roll lacked any shrimp or lobster flavor, and needed some acid. The roast chicken strawberry salad was moderate - a bit limp with the the wrong cheese from what was listed on the menu.  But the kicker of the evening - the slice of cake we ordered to go!  You won't believe how thin the slice is! Not even half the slice of a piece of cake at any other restaurant, this piece is half inch thick at its thickest!  Overall, the restaurant, although charming  in decor, is way overpriced for what you get.  Look carefully at the sign going in - when a restaurant paints a music staff with the wrong number of lines and a treble clef that looks nothing like what it is supposed to look like - when they don't care to get things correct - you know it filters into the food and service as well, which it did.  Sorry Chowder House, but it's time to go back to the boat."}
{"text":"Totally surprised by this eclectic little seafood joint. It ain't much to look at from the outside but don't let that deter you!  I'm so glad we went in because my pappardelle was delicioso, as was the chowder and the risotto. In fact the only complaint from the 6 of us was that there wasn't enough of it even though we were all stuffed! Don't skip dessert either!"}
{"text":"Had take out twisted noodles with ahi tuna, clam chowder and the fish tacos.  Everything tasted fantastic.  The noodles were dressed with a light and creamy sesame sauce, and the tuna was cooked to rare perfectly with a crispy crust of sesames.  It was (high-pitched) SO good. Reasonable prices, too. Unfortunately the tacos weren't warm by the time I got to them, but they had a thin, creamy sauce, with a little kick to it.  Overall, a really decent meal."}
{"text":"Bait and Switch!!!!!  When you order a lobster roll you expect lobster, not micro shrimp mixed with fake crab sticks fluffed up with romaine. Same goes for the Chicken sandwich, they served grey unflavored Turkey precooked heated up in a microwave as chicken, you can tell it came from a breast bigger then a whole damn chicken. The Lobster roll would not of been ordered if it would of said on the Menu \"Fake\" Lobster roll or Seafood roll with listing what is in it. The Scallop roll made me puke when i made it back to work, then horrible heartburn for 5 hours. Must of been a 50 cent can of baby scallops blended and emulsifyed with lots of egg and bread crumb slightly burnt edges, my last bite had giant pieces of grit/sand in it, almost puked right on the spot from that, the grit was bigger than kosher slat grains or any sand I've ever seen. Dirty Cluttered Restaurant, must of been an old house before, Everything was  served with stale chips. They don't offer appetizers and a cup of their gritty salty clam chowder soup is $5, The soup wasn't too terrible but considering its Heavy Cream and Calms, that's not hard to make at least OK using canned clam. It took 30 minutes just to leave!!! We are totally done and asked for a box, 30 minutes later (keep in mind my friends left me since it was taking so long) she gives me a bill, and i ask for a box which she never remembered me asking for in the first place.  I have a feeling all the great reviews are friends and family of the restaurant owners and workers.  Slight unrelated, Chowder House is owned by the same guy who made Sugo down the street but recently closed down. For Non-Food Reasons. I thought Sugo had Awesome Food!! Sorry for the lose of Great Food..."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting---and the food has always been tasty.  They don't skip on the seafood.  We didn't come with a reservation, which kind of threw them off their game. Food didn't come out very quickly this time, however, there was a large party so for the small kitchen it was understandable.  My fav item tonight was the salted carmel cheesecake. The reason for the three star review is because they do not accept credit/debit cards...cash or check only."}
{"text":"Only came here because we got a groupon. Had the same experience as others -- were immediately asked if we had a reservation, and because we didn't got shuffled to the side and told to wait for the side tables, even though it was far too early for them to be THAT booked up and there were lots of empty tables on the \"reserved\" side. The food was way pricier than I expected for such a tiny place, and the portions were EXTREMELY small for what you paid for. Food was mediocre. Don't serve alcohol of any kind, told us we were welcome to go nextdoor to Walgreens and buy our own and bring it in and then they would charge us a fee to be able to drink it... what's the point of that? Still want to try the brunch, maybe that will change my rating, but probably will not go there again if it's up to me. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Dined here with a party of 3 for first time in several years on 1/6/17 - as a result will never go back. Ordered 3 entre specials that were all bad. 2 Halibut dishes were over cooked and tasteless. The third meal was Grouper, it was marginal at best. All 3 meals were served lukewarm. The 2 Halibut meals tasted like they were reheated leftovers. We told the waitress and she said she would tell the chef and when we left she said \"I am glad you enjoyed your meals and come back again\"."}
{"text":"Alright so my mother convinced me to buy a groupon for this joint so we could go to dinner there,what a mistake! So we go there no crowd like two tables ,we decide on our dinners and my father and I decide on the beef brisket, but wait they're out of it already at 6:00 wth? So we have the 3 little pigs sounds good right? Well it was but the problem was mine came out 20 minutes after the other 3 meals were served.How is that ? Anyways Our waitress did apologize and gave me a free dessert but that was just bs in my opinion! So for me it was a one and done !!!!!Good luck"}
{"text":"Crab cakes were awesome as usual as well as the creamed corn it was served on. My Savanahs Best was very tasty also. The shrimp in it was awesome and the smaller of the 3 scallops was cooked perfect. It did seem that the 2 larger scallops could have used just a little longer cooking time. Loved the savory grits it was served on with that little heat kick to it. My husband got the steak salad with white French dressing and loved it. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great little resurant . Twisted noodles were the bomb . Lobster ravioli was excellent. And I finally found a lobster bisque better than The boardwalk at put in bay.  This will be our go to  when we want a nice night out. Did I say the twisted noodles were really good. I almost ordered again for desert.  The staff was great"}
{"text":"Over priced specials.  Not good. The clam chowder was good. Everything else mediocre at best.  Place smells too"}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Amazing value.  One of our favorite restaurants!  Others we love include: Greenhouse Tavern, Lola's, Spice, Saigon, Cowell & Hubbard, Russo's.  We don't do chain restaurants - ever."}
{"text":"The place sounds like a great idea; casual upbeat food, BYOB, and reservations-only on Fri/Sat night.  However, all this comes with a price.    The food- it's ok, better than Applebees, but not for the price.  You are getting mainly pasta and cheese sauce with 1-2 pieces of seafood for $20; not a deal.  BEWARE:  This 'corking' fee applies to ANYTHING, regardless if you bring an already-corked bottle or not.  They have the audacity to charge YOU to bring your own alcohol.  $5 to bring my own drink; what's next, $5 to piss in my own bucket?  This is a one-and-done kind of place.  Service is all over the place, no organization, and you have cooks taunting one another during your meal and yelling for the server's name every minute.  If possible, wait til Groupon comes out, so your not that out of your losses....."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood here.  I'm very picky about seafood, and rarely ever order it at restaurants.  I get seafood here every time. Lobster bisque is the best I've ever had. Food will not disappoint. Bring your checkbook BYOB - cuts down on my beer bill, I guess."}
{"text":"Little secret gem.  Seafood one of the best around.  You also bring your own alcohol so i like that idea.  Bring a cooler, some friends and enjoy some great seafood"}
{"text":"Eating at this restaurant was such a disapointment. I'm not sure if other reviewers have ever eaten good seafood or not to give it such high ratings.   We had a reservation and even though the restaurant was empty it took them 15 minutes to come take our drink order. Oh, and don't expect to get an alcoholic beverage here. They dont serve booze but they told us we could \"go buy wine from CVS and then we can open it here and charge you a wine corking fee\", well no thank you. They also don't accept credit cards.  The lobster bisque was runny and not flavorful, I'm not even sure any lobster was in it. The rest of our meals were just sub-par and with flies buzzing all around our table the dining expierence was less than appetizing. After the terrible service we received and bad food, I dont have an urge to even give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food.  Great lobster bisque.  Fantastic jalepeno vinaigrette dressing on my side salad - and the side salad was mixed greens - thank you for not serving pathetic iceburg like most places!  Incredible atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"OH MY DELICIOUS BRUNCH.   I honestly cannot explain how amazing this place is. My fiance and I go to brunch every Sunday morning and we are always looking for a new place to check out. After scouring YELP, I found some excellent reviews for Chowder House and off we went.   When we drove up I was instantly in love. It's tucked in on a side road and is brightly decorated, ornate and FUN! If the outside looks this fun, I cannot imagine the inside. And the inside you ask? Even better!   Chowder House also  support local farmers and sustainable foods and you can taste the difference. YUM, YUM, YUM.   Since we went on a Sunday they only had their brunch menu but there were still plenty of options. I ended up choosing the filet mignon eggs benedict and to say it was amazing was an understatement. I could have had it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, snack........you get the point.   Unique environment, great customer service, locally owned, amazing food! I'll be back many times again!  TIP: Cash/Check only."}
{"text":"Completely loved our dinner! Will come back very soon! Would highly recommend this place! Just remember to byob! Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently got a Groupon for this place and reading the fine print I notice a reservation was required, FYI.  We did notice the limited parking area and almost parked in a tow-a-way zone, so park in the back!  We arrived on time and was greeted with a charismatic server.  The place look \"hip\" and had a comfortable feel to it.  There really weren't too many people there at the time of day, so it wasn't crowed.  We started off with, I think they were shrimp tacos.  They tasted excellent, so that was a great start.  I then ordered the Lobster bisque and was really impressed on how good it was. As an entree I ordered the Flounder which was so fresh and tasted so awesome.  My wife order the pork wrapped with bacon and was not impressed, personally I think she just didn't understand what she was ordering.  She mentioned it was dry and not what she expected.  Everything tasted great to me, and was a little pricy, but I am willing to pay for freshness.  The reason I didn't give this place five stars was because the server refilled my beverage without telling me that there was a cost on every refill that you get, another FYI.  I would definitely recommend this place to a friend that has extra money to through around.  This place only excepts cash or check."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with phenomenal food. Very unique. Able to bring your own alcohol for a small fee.  Family atmosphere with exceptional service. One of my new favorites for sure."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. Decor was very nice and artistic.  This is a very small cozy place that makes you feel at home. It is definitely worth the price. For my personal preference I did not care for the lobster ravioli however the Seafood pappardelle was superb! Also, their crab cakes were top notch."}
{"text":"Pros:  funky little place; unique building, location, style.  Food was fine, nothing bad but nothing really stood out.  Cons: glassware and flatware were not very clean.  I ordered a diet coke and had finished half of it when I noticed a little glob of green material on the glass.  My hope was that it was stuck on the outside of the glass but no such luck - it was on the inside.  When our waitress came to refill it, I pointed it out and asked for a new glass.  She just looked at it and said 'OK' and brought me a fresh diet coke in a new glass (that really didn't look that much cleaner than the first one).  I won't go back; not because the food wasn't good but because I'm kind of skeeved out about the mysterious green glob that was in my diet coke."}
{"text":"Visited on 11/22/13. We kept seeing coupons on deals sites for the Chowder House so we purchased one. As of today their website has been down for awhile so I didn't get a peek at the menu since I bought the coupon awhile ago, but it was about to expire so we went last night, it was a Friday night at 5:30 and it was near empty, but picked up around 6 pm.  We had soups which were delicious, my husband had the \"3 Little Pigs\" entree, and I had the Seafood Scampi. Both were really good and very fresh tasting. Our server was very attentive as was the rest of the staff. The decor inside is very interesting and different, and the open kitchen is nice. We split a chocolate caramel pretzel cheesecake, I'm not sure if it was homemade but it was good nonetheless. I did see many reviews complaining about the portion size but I didn't have a problem with it at all, and I'm a big eater.  The prices were a bit high for my budget, but I knew this going in, but I feel the portion size and the freshness of the food matches up to the price. We will be back, but only for special occasions or if another coupon comes along :)"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant!  I'm still pretty new to the area, but my general impression is that there are very few, if any restaurants that support local farmers and sustainable food practices is Cuyahoga Falls.  This place does both and they have a delightfully unique menu.  I ordered the lobster bisque for an appetizer and the grilled Walleye as an entrée.  Both were absolutely delicious!!  My partner ordered the shrimp and lobster sandwich and loved it.  Everything was fresh and made to order, which is more than I can say for a majority of the other restaurants I've tried in the area.  Parking is limited, but you can park across the street at the CVS.  The place so far is CASH ONLY so be aware of that before you go.  The only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because the service was off the night of my visit.  However, they explained that they were opening another restaurant in Akron and just happened to be short staffed.  I'm sure on any other day, the service is fine since the place was relatively crowded on a Wednesday night, but until I go again, I don't know if that's true and service was definitely on the slow side when I ate here.  That said, I can't wait to go back to this little art café."}
{"text":"Wine Dinner Review  Yes... we still are monthly regular customers... but now they have started to offer wine dinners... once a month... they are closed on Monday but the last Monday of the month is Wine Dinner Night!  5 course... 5 wines... lemon infused water (more than a wedge, less than lemonade) was delightful between courses... one long table of wonderful foodies with a different theme each month.  Skipping lunch is recommended... we started with Gorgonzola bechemele and ended with berries and cream and cake and nuts and wine.  Short Rib tacos and goulash were in the middle.. not combined... and a delightful pork cutlet with a perfectly poached egg.  Such a great trip through a wide variety of cuisine... and wine... oh... the wine!  Can not wait for next month's... hopefully the weather will warm and it can be held outside!"}
{"text":"I had dined once before at Chowder House, with nothing standing out as memorable. With their recent deal on Groupon and being ranked in the top 100 restaurants of Northeast Ohio I figured it was time to try again. I was unfortunately very underwhelmed. The clam chowder was the only thing I would eat again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were not able to eat here because the business does not accept credit cards. They are also receiving one star for their attitude.  There are so many avenues these days to allow businesses to do this, it was not even something we thought about! As soon as we came in (with family visiting) we were asked if we had reservations, which we did not. The woman greeting us was very snippy about our lack of calling-ahead (for four people), and said it would be 15-20 min. We were prepared to wait, no big deal... but there were only two tables in the whole place with customers at them. I am not sure what we were waiting for!  While we were waiting we noticed the sign that said \"Only cash or check accepted\" and were pretty shocked. We confirmed with the woman at the hostess stand and apologized that we would have to find somewhere else to go. She was very rude about it."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was amazing and my husband and I loved our dinners.  We would highly recommend this place and we can't wait to go back!  Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Nice local place that has a real artsy look. Overall everything was great. I thought the lobster bisque was really good, as well as their pulled pork tacos. The service was very friendly and quick. The only downside is that it is cash/check only, which isn't a big deal but they don't have an ATM. You have to go to the gas station next door or the CVS across the street. The CVS is an Allpoint ATM that doesnt charge Fifth Third accounts btw."}
{"text":"Once again another fantastic meal was enjoyed this last Saturday night at the Chowder House. Everything is always so fresh and tasty. Can't say enough about the owner and his staff. We really appreciate that they chose Cuyahoga Falls to open the restaurant."}
{"text":"Small place, big food! Folk artsy ambiance, it's kind of quirky & fun. There may be 10 tables here, so calling for a reservation a good idea. And bring cash. And alcohol, if you feel the need.   10oz Kobe burger with blue cheese and yummy mashed potatoes for $12. Best deal in town. Solid muffalotta sandwich. Very nice Cod sandwich (broiled, not fried). Good cheesecake to finish us off.   Others have noted good for children.  My kids were fine with the cod sandwich and (sharing) the Kobe burger, but there is no kids menu, etc., so maybe not the easiest place for kids.  Check the menu online first & see if it fits your kid's tastes.  I'm looking forward to coming here for brunch one Sunday.   Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch here today. I love the decor - reminded me of New Orleans with the super creative colorful designs. Great food and friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! My husband said this was the best meal he has had start to finish. He had a bowl of the chowder, the filet mignon special, and we shared a blitz with homemade whipped cream for dessert. I had a cavatelli special with gorgonzola cream sauce, scallops, and lobster tail that was wonderful. Definitely check it out if you are in NEO!"}
{"text":"Always a fabulous meal, inventive menu, world's best lobster bisque.  Quaint  eclectic and fun decor. Downside is hard to find parking,  but you can byob with a resonable corkage fee.  Meal presentation is an art form,   taste us superb. One of favorites.  Added smoked brisket and ribs to the menu this summer, and the specials sound irresistible.  Cash and check only, leave your charge card ay home."}
{"text":"Food very good. Small unassuming atmosphere with great seafood. The clam chowder is very peppery so not for the weak at heart."}
{"text":"They only accept cash and checks, so make sure you are prepared before you go!!  They also are byob (or wine, which was the more popular choice). They charge a corking fee.   I got the chicken sandwich and replaced the chips which come as a side, with the twisted noodles. The chicken was cooked very tender and the bread it came on was nicely toasted. It had goat cheese on it. I am a fan of goat cheese, however, the chef was a little heavy handed with it, and it completely over powered all the other flavors of the sandwich. Had they used a bit less, I think it would have balanced nicely.   The twisted noodles are served cold, which I didn't realize. It wasn't bad, but not what I was expecting. They were a pretty basic Asian lo men noodle with a thick creamy soy sauced based sauce coating them. I think had I gotten the tuna appetizer, which the noodles are usually the base of, I would have enjoyed them more. As a stand alone side, I wished I would have gotten something else.   My friend got the burger, which was nice and thick. But he complained that the Gorgonzola on it was over whelming. I guess the chef really likes his cheeses. He got the mashed potatoes as a side. They had good flavor, but I didn't care for the texture because I prefer creamy mashed potatoes. While these were not chunky, they were, for the lack of a better word, gritty.   The service was very nice. The menu is a pretty small. But I like how they use local Ohio grown vegetables. I may go again, but over all, it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"My sister and I found the Chowder House through groupon. The food is awesome! We had a wonderful time. Our server was excellent as was the chef. I had the Chilean Sea Bass, when I ordered it they informed me that it came whole, which I thought was very nice. It was cooked perfectly. We also had the chowder, the ahi tuna appetizer and a few other entrees, (we had dates). It is byob, which I think is perfect. They also only take cash or checks. The summer menu just came out so we are planning to head back there soon!! I wish I lived closer so I could enjoy their $5 burger night on Tuesdays and we will be there for a wine dinner before summer is over!"}
{"text":"Fantastic local place with a cool, artsy vibe.  This place used to be Jimmy's coffee house and the interior remained the same.  They have daily specials and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Their lobster bisque is delicious, as are their crab cakes.  Usually, I take one of my kids and we share a bowl of the soup and split a sandwich.  I have always been satisfied with the food and service.   They do have outdoor seating and I celebrated Mother's Day with my sons outside. I had the chicken & waffles, which was very good.  They had the chocolate-chip pancakes.  We had lots left over!    For $5, you can bring your own alcohol!  Bring a bottle of wine and enjoy the ambience!       Cash only."}
{"text":"Considering making a standing weekly reservation, on par with the best seafood places i've ever been, my only regret is I didnt find it sooner."}
{"text":"Had reservations for 645 on a Friday night and were seated right away. We had a groupon bought for $11 but good for $30 worth of food. Ordered a bowl of lobster bisque based on reviews and they were right. It was really good with chunks of lobster. I brought in a bottle of wine and my husband brought whiskey. They only charged 1 cork fee of $5 for both. This saved so much just on the alcohol alone because we all know how expensive drinks can be. Love that! I ordered the lobster shrimp tacos appetizer for my meal that came with a small salad. It was delish and perfect size for me. I didn't want to be overly full and this nicely fit the bill. My husband ordered the beef brisket which had been roasting for over 12 hours and you could tell. It just fell apart on top of those buttermilk mashers. Yummy so good! Our final bill was $11 plus tip. The food was so good, the environment warm and inviting making you want to just hang out there. We will def be back with or without a groupon. It's so worth trying, you won't regret it! Thank you Chowder House for a super fun date night out with my hubby!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. I had Oscar-style grouper with crab served on mashed potatoes with asparagus and hollandaise sauce. It was so light and tender that it seemed to melt in my mouth. Husband ordered drum fish served over dirty rice with Creole gravy. Also delicious.  We enjoyed the eclectic decor and were pleased that we could enjoy our own wine for only a $5 corkage fee.  We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Greatness! Clam chowder- 9.9. Ahi tuna and twisted noodles- 9.5. Do it!"}
{"text":"We arrived with reservations and the girl who was texting, when we walked in, walked away leaving us standing there waiting for someone else to notice us. The place was not full but they still sat us in a dark area right next to the bathroom and in the main pathway between the kitchen and dining area. The service was ok once the waitress was notified we were in her section. The lobster bisque was very good. But don't get the flank steak. It was $18 and totally not worth it."}
{"text":"Dingy atmosphere, and the food was mediocre. The menu items sound more exciting than they are, and the whole restaurant just didn't feel very clean."}
{"text":"I have ZERO idea how someone could give this place one star. EVERYTHING we ate was delicious. My husband, who is hard to wow, was wowed!! He ordered the brisket and he was amazed by it. He also ordered the lobster bisque and we were pleasantly surprised at the amount of lobster in it.   I had the seafood pappardelle and it was tasty. It wasn't a huge portion, but it was good!!   We don't live close by, but we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how to rate this restaurant...my disclaimer is that my hubby and I are extremely picky diners/ consumers.  I got the impression that it is a low budget place in regards to business side of things or how it's run, definitely NOT low budget meals!  I have to agree with a previous post that said decor was quirky.  I would say \"tacky\" would be more accurate.  (Reminded me of an old coffee house back in the hippy days!!!) The large front window was dirty and there were also annoying flies in the place.  Parking was a challenge as nearby businesses don't allow parking in their lot...understandable, I guess.  We were there on a night where certain entrees are 2 for $30.00.  This is a fantastic idea but menus need to clearly state which entrees are included in this great deal.  There was a misunderstanding on our part as our server thought she stated our entrees as not being ones covered on this special and we heard otherwise.  It caused our ticket to be over $70.00 for 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.  She did correct the mistake and charged the 2 for $30.00.  Just make sure you understand which entrees are in this \"special\".  The clam chowder is delicious as are the crab cakes.  The stuffed scampi were wonderful.  I had grouper with mashed potatoes and zucchini.  I enjoyed the grouper very much, but my mashed potatoes were barely warm and there was way too much watery sauce on the plate.  We're glad we tried this restaurant, but without the \"special\" prices it would be tough to justify the food and experience."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey needs to visit here...it has possibilities with the decor and such, but service needs some help.  Cold Lobster Bisque, rude wait staff (though since not from the area could be the way its done here) and they really should move past Y2K...credit cards are ok. (Cash only restaurant)"}
{"text":"The Falls' hidden gem -- kooky decor, decadent food at a reasonable price. No reason why you shouldn't be eating here."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly and warm.  She was very attentive to our needs and we felt comfortable with her.  We ordered the Clam Chowder and the Lobster Bisque. Both were very delicious and a must-try if you ever visit this restaurant.  I ordered the Kobe Steak Burger and it did not arrive as stated on the menu.  I asked the chef how the burger came and he told me it was served with steak sauce and bleu cheese and potato chips. On the menu, it was supposed to be served with pickles and garlic mashers. I was very disappointed because the burger (which tasted average) did not live up to its $12 value. Unfortunately, even the sesame bun appeared and tasted like the ones fast food places use.  If I was to return to the Chowder House, I will try some of their dinner entrees (not served until 5pm) and have a cup of delicious soup and skip the sandwiches.  My rating of 3 stars is an average for the service (high marks) and burger (low marks).  Also, they do not accept credit cards, so be prepared with cash."}
{"text":"The three stars are really just for the lobster bisque- had a bowl and it was so good, I should've just had a second bowl for my entree.  Instead I had the pad thai- super disappointing.  Literally tasted like an Annie Chung's bowl from the supermarket soup aisle. Only sweeter. The scallops and shrimp on top were not good, tasted of chlorine, not fresh.  This place is really cute inside, and I love local places, but we were there for two hours at lunch time and my friend and I were the only customers in the entire place the entire time. This place has decent older reviews, I hope the chowder house can get it together- to the previous standards it seems to have had- in order to survive."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in the Akron area in all my years living here - and still one of the best I've had, period, when I compare it to the three years I spent brunching around Washington, DC. The service was perfect, the prices are low, the French toast is to die for, & the atmosphere is quaint & creative, very welcoming. I Aldo love that they try to use as much local produce & goods as possible - a rarity in the area.   Since my first visit, I've been recommending the Chowder House to everyone I know; I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Eaten here several times.  Some of the food here is absolutely brilliant.    First, parking.  Parking is very limited in the rear of the restaurant.  However, they have signs posted that the CVS across the street allows for patrons to park there.  Both their lobster bisque and clam chowder are NOT to be missed!  Absolutely amazing flavor in both, and HIGHLY recommended.  Their muffaletta sandwich is probably my least favorite on their menu.  It's just plain out of balance, tasting of nothing but olives, and so much olive juice included the bread gets soggy, causing the whole sandwich to fall apart before you finish.  Favorites on their lunch menu include their burger (VERY juicy, plenty of flavor, served with 3 different kinds of pickles), their seared tuna over cold sesame noodles, and their fish tacos.  Note, most of their lunch meals come with chips, but you can opt to have the cold sesame noodles instead if you wish (I love their  simple noodle dish).  Had two of their dinners, their Cassiolet (chicken, beans and bread crumbs, very filling and tasty), and three little pigs (pork shoulder, bacon, and pork belly).  Both are recommended as very filling and very tasty dishes.  One slight complaint, the pork shoulder on the three little pigs dish can sometimes be a bit dried out.   One last note, this restaurant specializes in local food, trying as much as possible to server food items grown in and around Northeast Ohio. Nice to see a place in the Akron area trying to make this effort."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is the bomb. It was our first visit, and after the meal we just had, I'd give 6 stars if I could.  We had a Groupon for $30 worth of food. I called and made a reservation and everything went super smoothly. The woman on the phone, who ended up being our server, was incredibly sweet and helpful. I didn't even feel like I was in Ohio. It's like we were transported to New Orleans or something. Everything is made in house except for the pasta, which they buy from a local small business. The food doesn't come out in 2 seconds like some other restaurants, and that's because it's actually being made, not heated up in a microwave. They do all kinds of specials and make different entrees every night. It's like the exact opposite of a chain.   We were lucky enough to be seated by the chefs window and had the pleasure of drooling over ever dish that came out. He was a really nice guy to chat with, as was everyone here.   We started with the Savannah's Best appetizer. It had shrimp and scallops over white cheesy grits, bacon, scallions and red peppers. Holy cannoli was it delicious. The scallops were to die for. The shrimp were a little salty, but had sooo much flavor. And the grits, oh lord the grits. I usually find grits to be kind of bland, but these grits were the opposite. So tasty.   My wife got the Chicken Supreme dish as her entree. You should have seen her face after taking her first bite! She was in HEAVEN. I was lucky enough to steal a bite, and I was also in heaven. It was delectable. I know most people will have an urge to order seafood, but if that isn't your thing, you can still hit a homerun here. The chicken breast was huuuuuge, and had white cheese, bacon, mushrooms and a creamy pan jus sauce on them. It also comes with mashed potatoes, which we found out were the chef's grandmothers recipe. This dish was the MVP of the night.  I ordered the crab stuffed scampi. While the chicken may have been MVP, the stuffed scampi wasn't far behind. I was literally licking my plate afterwards. The crabmeat stuffing was delicious, and I loved the citrus butter sauce. The scampi was ginormous.   As other reviews state, it's BYOB. They only charge $5 for you to bring your own 6 pack, and they'll keep your beer cold for you. It's also cash/check only, which they reminded us of when I made the reservation.  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday is $30 for two entrees, which is an awesome deal.  I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Good food in an eclectic, artsy atmosphere. I wanted to try it because of all the great reviews, I had the Grouper special and the BF had the Walleye. The fish was excellent as well as the mashed potatoes... The crab stuffing in my Grouper was over salted and the zucchini was almost raw, and the reason for my four stars. I'm torn whether or not I would go back.. it was a bit pricey for what you get.  They only take cash or check and you have to bring your own beer or wine if you would like a drink with dinner. They charge $5.00 to uncork your wine."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out after reading an article being one of the top 10 places to eat in Akron. First I would like to say that i love the eclectic style dining area and the location is somewhat small but very bright and warm. Great place for dates. Anyways, I started off with mussels with garlic and white wine sauce which was very good. The sauce was perfect and the garlic bread that came with it too. The entree I ordered was the lobster ravioli. Im not sure if it was this batch or not because this dish was highly recommended to me but my ravioli was salty. I was struggling finishing it and the sauce was the saving grace of this dish. The other dishes that my family ate was awesome though so thats always good. I dont think im being picky at all because like I said this was the only dish in my table that was really salty. Other than that I highly recommended it !!"}
{"text":"Went for a small dinner. Split the crab cakes (which were excellent) and had a bowl of lobster bisque. I tried their French onion as well. It was good, little extra thyme (I'm fairly sure it was that) then I care for."}
{"text":"just excellent.  friendly staff, good food, funky atmosphere.  there should be lines around the block to get in.  lobster bisque was excellent, the lobster shrimp tacos excellent.  seafood étouffée excellent.  don't miss the desserts, just fabulous."}
{"text":"Sad to say, but I would not recommend. We ordered the ribeye special (medium rare), the bourbon brisket, and added 2 side salads. The salads came out and were literally lettuce and 1 tomato on a plate. No onion, cucumber, cheese, crouton...hard to call that a side salad for $4.00. When the entrees came out they looked amazing! Key word: looked. The brisket, which was a large chunk of meat, was literally frozen in the middle. I'm talking full on ice. The ribeye, ordered medium rare, was half correct and half raw. We sent the brisket back and switched to the lobster ravioli which turned out to be a good choice because it was pretty good. We kept the undercooked steak since we had already returned 1 meal and were nervous what the kitchen staff might do. At the end, we ordered dessert which was tasty, but clearly not homemade. When the bill came, we were charged for everything...no free dessert for the raw brisket, no free soda...poor customer service. Overall way too expensive for the quality and lack of cooking skills!  I almost forgot to mention that we were seated off in a small dining area near the kitchen. The staff had the back door open  and not only was it freezing, but the employees were smoking and the smell was pouring into the dining area!"}
{"text":"This apparently is not a luncheon kinda place. The lobster roll wasn't. But rather mayo and celery on white bread. The lobster bisque which at dinner had large chunks of lobster in it, was flavored heavy cream poured over a lobster shell for flavoring. Portions were inadequate. Luncheon was a disappointment en toto. Will try them once again for diiner to determine if the hour is the culprit."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!!!   Outstanding service!  Out of this world food!  We started off our meal with the lobster bisque.   This was very flavorful and the \"cup\" size was huge!   Wonder what the bowl size looked like.   Really wanted to try the clam chowder, but they were out of it as our reservation was for 8:00pm.   That is the risk you take when you go to a restaurant that makes everything fresh!   We decided to try the pizza next.   They make a different pizza every day.   This time it was a goat cheese, roma tomato, eggplant pizza.   It was delicious.   I mean to tell you the chef really knows what he is doing when it comes to seasoning.   Seasoned perfectly!   My husband had the three little pigs...I am not a pork fan, so I didn't try it but he loved it.  He said the sauce was amazing as well as the pork shoulder was very tender and moist.   Our friend had the flank steak, which I had to taste.   This too was stupendous!    I ordered the ravioli which also changes daily.   This was a mushroom stuffed ravioli with an asparagus cream sauce...BELLISSIMO!    We were so full after this wonderful meal, we decided to split dessert.   We had the tiramisu cheesecake.   There was nothing bad about our experience here....(except running out of the clam chowder).   I cannot wait to go back.   I have heard they do wonderful breakfasts and brunches as well.   The only reason I gave them 4 stars was because of having to bring your own liquor and they charge a \"corking\" fee of $10.00 for wine and $5.00 for a six pack of beer.   I am willing to overlook this as everything else was magnificent!"}
{"text":"Not good. Lobster bisque is supposed to be thick. Theirs is watery. Lobster roll is no good. Seafood tacos were empty"}
{"text":"Another very good meal. Great clam chowder their way with no potatoes. The wedge salad was heaped high with blue cheese crumbs and plenty of white French dressing. The crabs cakes were hardy. The crab stuffed sole with rice cakes was very good and large portion. Fun atmosphere. On this night the patio was busy. We like Chowder House."}
{"text":"The Chowder House is such a weird little place.  Tucked away on a side street in Cuyahoga Falls, you kinda have to be looking for it.  One of my only complaints would be that they have a small parking lot and it fills up quickly.  Sometimes we are forced to park at CVS & walk across the street.  It's not a big deal to us, but our server told us the people at CVS don't exactly approve.  So...I won't tell them if you don't!  The outside of the building is definitely unique, and there is wackadoo stuff all over the inside walls.  The last time we were there, I sat beside a wall with a bunch of googly eyes glued to it.  It's not a boring little run-of-the-mill cafe, that's for sure.  On to the important part - the food.  The lobster bisque was very good.  Buttery and rich, and not at all fishy.  I had a portabella sandwich and it was excellent.  I can't remember what my husband had but he liked it, and he's pretty picky.  As other have mentioned, this is a CASH ONLY place, so be prepared for that.  Also, you can BYOB for a $10 corking fee/$5 for a six pack.  If you're going on a Friday or Saturday evening, I'd definitely recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch while we were visiting Cleveland. We were quite surprised to see we were the only customers. Kind of disheartening, but benefit of the doubt, right? To our amazement, the lack of customers was no reflection of the quality and taste of the food. The lobster bisque was pretty satisfying, my wifes kobe steak burger was one of the best we've ever tried, and my \"sampler\" was pretty solid. Definitely try the Twisted Noodles! Check out the desserts. Our cheesecake was made fresh and really mouth watering. My only **concern** was the clam chowder. Could have mistaken it for biscuit gravy any day of the week. Not really sure it wasn't... All in all, the food was well above average, and the service was helpful and well-versed. If I make it back to the Cleveland area, I will be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to check out Chowder House for a few months and even purchased a Groupon. Life got in the way and expired so it was basically a bogo  a big factor in a great experience is being able to bring in your own alcohol and just a $5 corkage. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable. Very impressed with the chef.  We actually chose soups. Fiance had clam chowder and I had French onion. Omg the spicy noodles at $4 a bowl..we ea ordered our own  and then  finished with salad. We def will be going back with several friends who love seafood."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem this is! I don't know how I've never noticed the Chowder House when driving on state road - I mean it really is hard to miss with it's decorative exterior. And the eclectic decor continues on the inside! From the second I walked in, I knew I was going to love this place. Chowder House specializes in seafood dishes with a New Orleans flair. After trying the clam chowder, lobster bisque, and seafood etouffee with shrimp and scallops, I would argue that this is the best seafood you will find in Cuyahoga Falls. What takes this place to 5 stars for me is their BYOB policy. For only a $5 corking fee, you can bring your own wine or beer. We will be back many times!"}
{"text":"CHC is a treat for me. I'm no gourmet, but the quality of ingredients and preparation is evident. Though seafood is their specialty, their other dishes (especially their steaks, for me) have never disappointed. The weekend specials keep the menu fresh. Highly recommend the bisque or chowder before your meal. And the casual, colorful, quiet ambiance is perfect for a date or talking with friends. A little pricey, but I don't mind when the quality and service are so good. I've eaten at plenty of top notch restaurants that left me wondering why."}
