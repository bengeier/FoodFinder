{"text":"I'd like to say something about the food but can't. Last time I was there, we were sat at a table and then ignored for 15 minutes - and then we left.

I marked it 3 stars because it's what they're already ranked at now and I don't want to actually damage their ranking. Like I said, I haven't had the food, so it would be ignorant to give it any kind of star ranking - maybe the food is actually good; I would have loved to have found out, but again - *ignored* by wait staff for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Yeah. Nice but miss. Very flavourful but overpriced for what you get. Left full but not satisfied, you know what I mean? I'd go back if I had to but I wouldn't really recommend it. If I want really good Iranian/Lebanese/Jewish/Mystical Islamic food or whatever it is, I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and many options sure to appeal to meat-eaters, vegetarians, and gluten-free folk alike. 

As a vegetarian, I had the dal which was very good though not necessarily a step above other dal. I also had the butternut squash in tahini which was very good. My table raved about the baba ganoush; it was slightly smokey and packed with flavor. 

The naan was very good but, again, not necessarily stand-out. The meat eaters at the table thoroughly enjoyed their lamb entrees."}
{"text":"Envie d'un brunch différent? Un brunch qui goûte autre chose que le gras et le cantaloup pas mûr?  Essayez les brunchs du Rumi. Saveurs et dépaysement assurés.  (J'ai beaucoup aimé le tajine Jérusalem.)
Attention toutefois, comptez 20-25$ par tête."}
{"text":"I went to Rumi last night with a group of friends on a recommendation.  The babagonouche and paprika hommus were wonderful an the lamb shoulder was delicous.  Great atmosphere in a great neighbourhood.  This was a very pleasant and highly recommended experience for anyone visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable !
Just my type of place ! 
Food is great, tea is good !
Simple :) I'll go back"}
{"text":"Went here for a girls' night once. There wasn't anything particularly bad about the place (it's cute), and the service is on par. But the general consensus at the end of the night was a 'meh' all around. There was nothing that stood out for us enough to warrant the price of the menu. I honestly can't even remember what I ate there, aside that the meat was on the dry side."}
{"text":"This is a treasure of a place. Trying to find a place like this in Manhattan. If anyone has a suggestion...."}
{"text":"Rumi is pan-middle eastern restaurant.  I am from Iranian origin, and I couldn't tell what was Iranian on the menu (other than the poet Rumi).  The appetizers are good, the main food is only okay.  If you want real persian food, I wouldn't go here.  If you do want to go here, I'd suggest going heavy on the appetizers with bread, and sharing the chicken dweshy dish.  The salmon was dry, but the mushroom sauce is good, and the lamb dish is reminiscent of a moroccan tagine but not quite the same."}
{"text":"If you like middle eastern food and/or you will find something(s) on this menu you will like. . . . not because you will find your favorite \"signature dishes\" but because you will have an affinity for and a general familiarity with the food.

The food was delicious - try the sweet potato tahini with naan as an appetizer.

The restaurant is in a leafy neighborhood; it was very relaxing to dine outside although the interior space was very inviting as well.

Some of the entree items seemed overpriced but that was only ~20% of the menu

Servers were very friendly and likeable"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. I ordered the Moussette cocktail, which was a bit strong on the pastis but very different, so I appreciate it. Our appetizer salad was very fresh and delicious and my shawarma was so tasty! My hubby got the Sultan and it was very tasty and juicy! 

Not sure about why ppl complain about the small portions. I think they were pretty generous. Of course, you have to make sure to order from the main meals and not just the hot mezes.

We will definitely be back since it's a nice stroll from our home. Can't wait to try their other items!"}
{"text":"A lovely space hidden away in a residential neighbourhood, across the street from Mile End's iconic Croissanterie Figaro. Middle-Eastern / North African menu, with an Iranian influence but not traditionally Iranian, slightly Moroccan, but not overly so. Friendly service on a busy night. Really wonderful lamb stew dishes -- so filling, we could have had one between us. Dal soup full of subtle flavour. Traditional Moroccan mint tea. I'd happily go back here over and over, and work my way through the entire menu."}
{"text":"Amazing! My family loves middle eastern cuisine and we came here on our short visit to Montreal. We've tried many of the middle eastern options in NYC and this is up there with the best of them. Also, it's not your average fare...as others have mentioned its a fusion of different cuisines and if you like ME food but are up for
a surprise, this is the place to be.

I've never had squash at a middle eastern rest and this squash was unbelievable...from the Sunna appetizer to the roasted squash served with mains. Another must try app is babaganoush. It's not your traditional baba...it's sweeter and so delicious w the naan bread. We also had kibbeh, hudja and a walnut cheese spread...all of which were good, not amazing.

The entrees were all phenomenal. The sultan lamb dish was so flavorful and complex as were both chicken dishes. And a delicious zucchini caviar w a chicken dish is a must try. We ended the meal w great tea and desserts that were just ok, but we don't really like ME desserts. Oh and I also loved the light but deep lentil soup, great to start.

And all these raves don't even mention the wonderful waitress who even wrote down a bakery Rec for us when we asked at the end of our meal.

I wish I was coming back to Montreal sooner so that I could go back to rumi!"}
{"text":"What I like about Rumi is that they have hand picked some hard-to-come-by dished from Middle East. Hence, the menu represents signature dishes of a culinary stand point and delicacies rather than well known and mainstream items. For example, the Sultan with orange-zest and carrot rice on the menu, is a very rare Persian dish that is served only on very important occasions; The Rumi's version is an absolutely delicious one.

Overall, Rumi is a place that permits exploring and enjoying good food from a vast geographical area."}
{"text":"Beautiful environment, food and tea. It's not cheap but it's well worth the price. They serve Persian tea (Black tea with cardamon) and Moroccan tea (green tea with fresh mint and sugar). There are books about Sufism on the shelf and the service is wonderful. Meat is Halal and really fresh. Everything I had was seasoned and prepared beautifully."}
{"text":"The menu touches Iranian, Turkish and Lebanese meals. The portion is not plenty but enough. Slightly overpriced. Decoration reminds you of cafés in the Middle East. A bit dark. The lamp just over my head would project my own shadow on my plate!! 
Staff nice and friendly. The appetizers make a meal and are yummy. Make sure you order Naan. It is a must. 
Desserts go very well with tea.
We stayed an hour after the closing time of the restaurant and sensed no complaint or inconvenience.
I would go again but I have reservations when I consider the prices."}
{"text":"I went there last night with friends and thought we were going for Moroccan food.  This food was tasty but I don't think it's traditional.  Still it WAS tasty.  We shared a couple of appies - the baba ghanoush and the wali.  We ordered this with naan bread.  The wali is a dip based on feta cheese and basil that I'd never had anywhere before and I really enjoyed it.  I'm going to try and make it myself.  Then we shared a couple of entrees - the Djaj Meshwy and the Sultan.  The first was a chicken dish with basmati rice and grilled vegetables and the second was a slow cooked lamb dish with basmati rice and squash.  Both were flavourful and washed down well with a bottle of Chateau D'Or et de Gueules from Costieres de Nimes.  We finished with cappuccinos and a Turkish coffee.  My friends didn't like their cappuccino and although my coffee was ok I was expecting to get the little pot of turkish coffee to pour into my little cup and sweeten myself.  The prices were reasonable and the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"I went with Luisa who posted a very detailed description of the food here already.  I want to add that the food and the atmosphere here keep me coming back almost every time I'm in Montreal.  In the summer, you can eat on the corner terrace in this lovely green  neighbourhood just a little outside MIle End.  On a cold winter night, it's as warm and inviting as a persian rug!  The food, as mentioned by others already, is kind of a fusion of North African, Persian, and  Afghani and  I find the flavours and seasonings to be  much more intricate than the more \"in your face' spices of, say,  Indian food.  I've had all the lamb dishes they offer, and all are delicious, but the one with apricots is my favourite!  This is a stand-by for me, when visiting Montreal - it never disappoints me."}
{"text":"I came here with much higher expectations. The service is extremely slow, unprofessional and not welcoming. The bread before meal was freezer  cold and it took them 15 minutes to warm it. Some of their staff behave in very rude manner. Their selection of wine is incomplete and doesn't have options to please people with different taste. Food is mediocre and not close to what it should taste. Specially the wait before dinner makes it more difficult to enjoy it. Their plates and glasses are not very clean. All these negative points made me to not wait a minute to write this review to not to forget how bad was my experience."}
{"text":"Notre dîner en groupe (10) était vraiment bien chez Rumi. Un service parfait et des plats absolument excellents. On commande des mezes et des plats, et on partage. Je recommande!"}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Montreal. I was shocked that it wasn't packed at brunch. The shakshuka was heavenly! I cannot wait to eat here again the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Incroyable! Belle terrasse a l'ombre. La meilleure soupe dal de montréal!

Les brunchs sont aussi très originaux, ca change des oeufs pour une fois!"}
{"text":"This not Turkish, not Indian, not Persian. Something strange. Waste of money and time."}
{"text":"I've come to Rumi several times and find it pleasant but a bit over priced. They have beautiful decor, low seating and normal seating. Teapots and lanterns on every turn. 
Their food is typical Mediterranean food, complete with all the \"salads\" (hummus, Baba ganoush, etc.) and lamb, chicken, meatballs. They are halal which is a bonus for me. The meals are large and hearty, one can definitely share or eat family style, and they have an extensive tea list. 

The lentil soup is my favorite in the city and their Moroccan mint tea is very authentic. Rumi has large tables for big groups and intimate areas of the restaurant. It's rarely packed, but I always make a reservation in advance. I appreciate how such a magnificent restaurant is tucked into a quite part of Rue Hutchinson, which makes street parking accessible."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago and everything was delicious. Got the hummus, labneh, tagine and grilled chicken. Would come back here again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. It's why I'm giving this a 2 stars and not a 1.

It was a very expensive restaurant for what you get, and the service was so slow. It's not like the restaurant was busy so I really don't understand why the waitress took so long to take our orders and serve us. We were a group of 4 on  Wednesday night. There were about 3 other couples in the restaurant and that was it. 

We ate outside and their outdoor seating is ok but she gave us a table far away because we might have expanded to a group of 6 so we needed extra seats. The table was next to the door that led to the bathroom, not exactly prime seating. Every other table was empty, I feel like she could've figured out something better given that it wasn't going to be busy.

I don't understand the appeal. The food isn't something special, even if it was good."}
{"text":"Good food!  Great Ambiance!  Usually service is top! stuff is very helpful and turnoever rate is very low meaning the stuff likes to work there!"}
{"text":"Rumi, c'est la promesse de goûter quelque chose du Moyen Orient qui est très bon. Sans se centrer sur un pays particulièrement, c'est tout le moyen-orient qui est représenté.

J'y suis été en groupe de 10 personnes et je dois dire que ça doit être la meilleure façon de découvrir ce restaurant. En groupe, le restaurant vous offre de faire le menu dégustation de groupe. Ce menu est en premier une dégustation sur pain naan de plus de 10 \"trempettes\" différentes. Ces trempettes sont très variées, il y a de l'humus, de la tzatziki et beaucoup d'autres choses qui goûtent bon. Ce qui est le fun, c'est que c'est illimité de pain naan qui est tellement moelleux sérieux. Donc, vous pouvez vous plaire à tous goûter et profitez du menu de groupe.

Le plat principal était le choix de 3 plats principaux : Agneau, poulet et légumes, tous apprêtés de façon Moyen Orient.

L'ambiance est très bien, on a un décor Moyen Orient.

Très belle expérience. Si j'avais à recommencer avec une sortie de couple, je prendrais 3 entrées différentes et un plat principal à partager."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at this resturant two nights ago. The service was very good, and our most attractive server very helpful with suggestion. We sat outside with lots of other people, a very cozy neighborhood atmosphere. I  had the best soft drink of my life, \"iced mint lemonade\" unbelively good, lots of crushed ice, and vibrant, fragrant mint cut up very fine and of course the lemonade. Served in a attractive tall jar.

We had a rio of mezes, babaganoush, fresh cheese, olive oil, and spices and a new one on me Sunna squash with a dash of maple syrup and hot paprika, very good. And of course nanan. We,then had oven roasted leg of,lamb covered with spics and a thick tomato sauce, grilled vegetables and basmati rice executed perfectly. 
Worth a try if you like middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Je ne peux faire de commentaires sur la nourriture puisque je suis partie après 25 minutes d'attente. 
Le serveur nous a placé dans le coin des banquette avec 2 verres d'eau et un menu, qui, ma foi, m'avait l'air délicieux. 
25 minutes plus tard: nous étions toujours là à nous regarder dans le blanc des yeux pour obtenir du service. Je dois ajouter que nous avions fait signe à plusieurs reprises aux serveurs qui nous a fait signe à leur tour d'attendre...
Je trouve cela inadmissible! 

Alors je vous souhaite bonne chance et en espérant que vous puissiez avoir autre chose que de l'eau sur votre table!"}
{"text":"Très bonne cuisine, un choix précis de saveurs et d'épices. on vient faire un petit voyage en orient, les mets sont délicats, les boissons et les desserts sont au même niveau de raffinement. Il faut apprécier des découvertes orientales, pleines de finesses, l'histoire et la culture des restaurateurs signent ce que vous dégustez.
On ne vient pas là par hasard, on s'y attarde, une cuisine de grande qualité, très bien servie."}
{"text":"Being a fan of Mevlana (Jalal ad-Din) Rumi, I was super excited when my friends booked this place for dinner on a Friday night. Apparently, it was difficult to get a reservation (especially during a peak time) so make sure to book a few days in advance.

Tucked away in the lovely Outremont area, Rumi is not difficult to miss. I immediately fell in love with the place from the exterior and was even more blown away by the interior. The layout and arrangement are similar to Turkish restaurants (low tables with hard-cushioned seating). The interior however, has Arabic, Persian and Turkish influences - all reminiscent of traditional Islamic art & design. Intricate floral and geometric patterns on rich carpets and tapestry, dim lighting and interesting paintings - we happened to be placed right next to a large painting of Rumi himself, in the central 'raised' seating part.

The menu has a variety of Persian/Turkish/Moroccan dishes. We ordered many dishes to try but found the portion sizes very small. For our starters, we had the Baba Ganoush, Kibbeh and Yaffa with naan. Everything was very delicious, the naan is a must as it is freshly made. The Kibbeh could have been better - we were a group of 4 and our server told us (quite rudely) that it is only 3 kibbehs per portion. We asked to add an extra and didn't mind paying extra but she argued that we would need to order 2 plates. 
I had the 'Dervish' for my main course, delicious beef & lamb patties with rice and vegetables. It was delicious but again, I found the portion (or meat quantity for that matter) quite small for the price. My friend had a tagine which looked very appetising!
We were all drawn to the 'Rumi pomegranate with mint & orange blossom water' drink on the menu that sounds divine on paper. The very dark purple concoction was presented beautifully but in reality tasted like a certain cough medicine! Very very disappointing, none of us were able to handle more than a few sips of it...  It was actually non-drinkable!

Food, price and service could definitely be better. It is slightly overpriced for what you get, the portion sizes are small and the waitresses could be more polite with a better understanding of the cultured menu. However, the place is too inviting so I would definitely go again, but mainly for the ambiance. It is a beautiful and ideal restaurant for a date or with friends as it is intimate & cosy."}
{"text":"It's a nice and cosy place, with a traditional cuisine of the Middle East, North Africa, & Central Asia. Service is okay, food is not bad, which is the main reason I just gave it a 3 stars. I would not consider it an exceptional place, certainly not one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Came with several friends and acquaintances this past Saturday night for a birthday dinner. I'd never had Iranian/Central Asian cuisine before, and man, did this place deliver. Beautiful interior, good service, great food (I was starving and ordered a truckload), and good company. The naan bread, lamb and beef appetizer, and plate of saffron rice and carrots with lamb hit the spot and left me almost unable to move from my seat by the time we were ready to leave! I will definitely want to  be back next time I come to Montreal!"}
{"text":"The food here is DELICIOUS. Truly! The hummus was fresh & tasty, albeit a small portion, but it doesn't come with anything - like pita...!!  How can you have a dish on your menu that requires you to order something else just so you can eat it?! 
The Kafke, wholesome all natural angus beef, was melt in your mouth sublime!
We were lucky enough to get comfortable in the one cushioned booth. I wish all their seating was like that. The regular tables & chairs lack the comfy authenticity that the food and general ambience boasts.  Food quality 4 star, but comfort & pricey hummus solo just plain pissed me off."}
{"text":"Lovely place, many dishes from all over Asia and Africa. Tasty but portions are ridiculously small. We thought it was a joke.     The flavour is there, the presentation is there , the ambiance is lovely . Our waitress was clueless and indifferent. Would not recommend it as portions are too small fir your paying. There are many better restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious and very tasty food!! 
The nan bread was incredible, also the service is good. 
I tried rumi labneh it was really good, babaganoj and hummus are good too . 
My friend ordered kebeh and she liked it so much."}
{"text":"People seem to mistake Rumi for a Persian restaurant, or Arabic restaurant or Turkish restaurant or Afghan restaurant or Moroccan restaurant. In reality, it's a mish-mash of all of the above.

Run by 2 Jewish brothers who became Sufis (people who practice Sufism, which is a form of Islamic mysticism), Rumi is named after Jalal ad-din Rumi, the medieval Persian poet and father of Sufism, who was born in present day Afghanistan, wrote in Persian and lived and died in present-day Turkey and the restaurant's decor and food is a testament to all these different regional influences as well.

The food is delicious, particularly the hibuscus flower drink and the roasted lamb shank with apricots. This is a wonderful place to come to for dinner with a friend or two."}
{"text":"I have such great memories of meals with friends and family at this restaurant, but my last meal was rather disappointing. The reason I always loved Rumi was because of the sunna mezze,  (squash, tahini and maple syrup) even if the portion is very small. However, that was when the prices were a lot cheaper and ordering a mezze of sultans was actually cheaper and not equivalent in price as ordering individual mezzes. The portions are just perfect, but the prices have now become exorbitant for such as small plate. I can no longer justify ordering a mezze of sultan no matter how delicious they taste, especially since I  have to pay $3 for each piece of naan! 

As for the main courses, this is a reminder to myself to steer clear of grilled meats in the future. The shish kabob and chicken were definitely on the dry side. The cornish hen stuffed with apricots and raisins was tasty and not too dry.  After I finished my meal, I realized that the reason I enjoy going to Rumi is because of their flavorful stews and I really regret not choosing one this time. 

I remember Rumi as an affordable and casual place for supper, but after this last visit, I don't think the food quality justifies the price any longer. The service is very friendly and the atmosphere is lovely, but I would think twice before bringing out of town friends to this restaurant again. If you do decide on going, definitely try the sunna and the wali, they are truly delicious!"}
{"text":"Pour faire changement du sempiternel \"deux oeufs, bacon\", essayez le brunch de chez Rumi. Les saveurs et même le décor sont totalement dépaysants. J'ai testé et beaucoup aimé le tajine Jérusalem, mais tous les tajines semblent délicieux ! En plus, le service était impeccable. Ça vaut vraiment le détour."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern, with a creative twist, dishes. Try the lemon and mint juice, so refreshing and delicious. The grilled dishes were very good, but so was everything else really"}
{"text":"Great vibe indoors, beautiful neighborhood if you sit outdoors. Excellent service. Very good food but I've seen better in this category in Montreal. But overall was a wonderful experience and we enjoyed our evening a lot."}
