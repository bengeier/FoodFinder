{"text":"Being Black in White Spaces: I decide to go to Park House for a beer.  Ah yes I want to like Park House, I really do and I have tried several times.  So I sit down and order a beer, with the help of a nice patron who actually heard me say I wanted a Belgian Beer that was not sour.  (Not being heard or seen is part of being Black in white spaces and it is not the first time this has happened at Park House.  Not being seen by the waitstaff and/or having a different encounter with staff than my white friends.)  So there are two TVs at the bar.  One with local news, the one in from of me is showing the RNC.  I say out loud, \"Oh I cannot watch this...no.\"    A white woman at the bar overhears me and says, \"This is your country, you have to educate yourself, you must watch it.\"  I pause and think for a minute.  Then I say, \"I wasn't talking to you.  You don't know anything about me.\"  But she continues...  [Feeling comfortable, confident and protected especially talking to someone who is not protected or respected is another thing about being Black in white spaces.  And Park House is proving to be a white space.]  So I say, \"Look I am surrounded by stupid white people all day, I don't need to take time out especially to watch them on TV.\"  Her response, \"You're stupid.\"  So now we're in kindergarten.  And I notice a slight slurring of her speech, she is not on her first drink.  I pause again.  I look at the bartender for context.  I ask, \"Do you know her?\"  His response:  \"Oh she's here all of the time.\"  [Ok that says something.]  Me:  \"Does she always go around calling people stupid.\"  His response:  \"Ummm..mmmmm.uhhh\" complete with shoulder shrug.    [For the record.  I have a Masters degree, is a former professor, worked on political campaigns before I could even vote, worked and volunteered for elected officials on local, state and national levels and anyway I could go on.  But I was not, not in the mood to watch the --ump Fest.]   So I look her in her eye.  \"Did you just call me stupid?\"  She doesn't say anything.  \"Ok so now that I am looking at you, you have nothing to say.\"    Then she says it again, \"You're stupid.\"  At that moment a bit of advice given a long time ago came in my head.  \"If someone says something to you, ignore them, if they lay a hand on them, put them down.\"  So I decided to finish my beer.  It was a rather nice Saison and left."}
{"text":"Throw your peanut shells on the floor and wave your banjo like you just don't care!  The Park House is the perfect blend of casual and trendy with emphasis on easy cool. Lots of great live music, featuring bluegrass and acoustic. There's never a cover and they have an AWESOME draft list and inexpensive pub food. Everyone who works here is fun and very helpful with the craft beer selection.  One of the best things - all the FREE Popcorn and Peanuts you can handle! The crowd here is happy and relaxed which makes for easy mingling and making new friends.   When there's live music, especially a band, it's loud - so if you are looking for intimate conversation, sit by the door or head on down to James Street Pub a few blocks away.

{"text":"We had a Groupon to use for The Park House. It included two sandwiches/entrees and two sides. We each had a pint of beer with dinner and were shocked when we received our check: our beer was $44. I was charged $22.50 for Southern Tier's Choklat Stout. The same size bottle retails for approximately $10. That is completely ridiculous. It also does not help that they do not have beer prices listed.   One star for the ridiculous overcharge. The food was good."}
{"text":"Really like this bar. Very friendly staff, good menu with not just the regular bar food. Recommend."}
{"text":"I ate there as I was staying at a nearby hotel. Although the reviews said a local friendly crowd it was fairly empty for a Thursday night. That being said, the bartender was on point and the burger I had was off the hook good. It is cooked on a little flattop right behind the bar but it was seriously stupid good. If I'm staying at the priory hotel again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Park House has awesome food! I usually order the falafel, which is the best in town. But I just had the Golani the other night and it was astounding. It's a spinach and cheese patty, with some secret ingredients that I assume include some controlled substances, because I'm already jonesing for another fix."}
{"text":"I like that this bar is really low key and has a great selection of ciders. I reccomend it as a nice out of the way place or a way to get into the Norhside if you haven't already."}
{"text":"The owner and chef is amazing! So welcoming and kind. He gave us an umbrella not knowing if we'd ever bring it back. We did the next night and stayed  for a drink or two and ended up ordering food. Needless to say the chicken kabobs were amazing and I will try to my dying day to replicate the peanut sauce and the hummus pizza was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Went my first time for Thursday karaoke and had a blast!  They serve mediterranean fare; at least half the menu is vegetarian/easily vegan.  There are at least 2 bike racks outside, cars have decent options too.  At 10pm an improv comedy group showed... you can imagine the energy.  Super fun night, met some cool people, ate healthy food.  Oh yes, and it's no smoking!       Downside?  It's a little pricey, but the quality is there, so... you decide."}
{"text":"Really great place to go. There was bluegrass music playing when I went which was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't too loud, so you could talk with others at your table. The food and service was great. Definitely want to come back here again"}
{"text":"An old Pittsburgh favorite nestled on the North Shore. I've been coming here for over thirty years - fortunately it hasn't changed much. Still great service, good beer & spirits selection. Free popcorn. Live entertainment. Truly a great treasure."}
{"text":"Good beer, Wednesday night is banjo night which always draws a crowd. Definitely a hipster bar. Food is fresh & worth trying. Get a dish that includes the house humus."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about their food and decided to check it out one night after purchasing a Groupon. This review is strictly for the food. It was not good. The hummus was okay, and our main plate seemed to be microwaved.   The bar ambiance seemed cool though. So if you are looking for a bar atmosphere, I'd probably rate this 3.5 stars. For dinner, not that great."}
{"text":"I was here for the well-known bluegrass night on a Wednesday a couple weeks ago and had a pretty good time. A friend met up with me here and we were able to enjoy the live music close to the bar and actually meet a few of the locals. I enjoyed the crowd- it seemed to mostly consist of 20 and 30 somethings, a bunch of bros, some couples, single girls and guys. We got some of the hummus, which was pretty good. If someone invited me, I'd definitely stop in again. $2 Yuenglings for the bluegrass night (that's reason enough to stop in again, right?)."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I go on Wednesdays for bluegrass night and a few beers. They have a great selection on beer and the decor is so cool and interesting. It's a great slice of Pittsburgh history. The environment is friendly, the people are friendly, the staff is friendly, the band is friendly. They have a popcorn machine and a peanut bin for free munchies. Just go!  Peanut allergic people: note the mention of a giant bin of peanuts."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. Great beer selection. Burgers and falafel . Free peanuts and popcorn. Z is the best ."}
{"text":"Gyros are delicious! Called for a pick up order and it was ready in 10 minutes. They also have a nice beer selection. Bluegrass night on Wednesdays gets pretty crowded, so you'll probably want to get there early."}
{"text":"We tried the Park House hoping to play some Trivia on a Tuesday night. We loved the draft beer selection and pricing as well as the Trivia itself although teams are only supposed to be four players at the most (word to the wise since we arrived with a team of six but they seemed pretty accommodating of first timers so that was cool, because really, our team consists of one uber smart chica and a bunch of dunderheads that occasionally recall something obscure).    The food is middle eastern and made to order.  I had the Naked Falafel basket and the chicken skewers with the spicy dipping sauce and my partner had the Falafel Master which was a falafel in pita with hummus lettuce and pickles with cucumber sauce.  The falafels were a little extra crispy on the outside but perfectly creamy dense on the inside.  The dipping sauce was perfectly garlicky and smooth with the right balance of yogurt and seasoning.  They also have unlimited free popcorn. Yummy and not too salty which is always a bonus.  Trivia night was a good mix of difficult and easy questions.  Each round winner gets to select a prize and the trivia master plays a nice mix of jazz and lounge and soul music in between questions/rounds.  It was crowded for a Tuesday night and there is plenty of free on street parking after 6PM nearby.  We'll be back there in January if you're itching for a battle."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local spots. The owner is Zamir is the bomb.  He prepares the best gyro you will find in the Burgh. The bar staff are great, friendly, attentive and fun!  This is one of the few places left in the North Side that has consistent live music or entertainment, with quality acts from all over the country popping in to perform.  Free popcorn and peanuts...., plus a dart board and a juke box are available if you're into that.  Check this place out it's full of character, don't let the neighbor hood mislead you from this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I moved to the North Side in July, and this has since become my \"place\" in the area.  The atmosphere is your typical small, dark, old tavern, with lots of charm and character. They always have a great craft beer selection on draft, the bartenders are friendly, fun and super helpful, and the live bluegrass on Wednesday nights is totally worth coming out for alone ($2 Yuengling specials for a girl on a budget does not hurt, either.)  I've also come out for their trivia night on Tuesday with friends, and that is most assuredly an excellent time.  Honestly, this has become my bar security blanket, it's fantastic to be walking distance from a place that's always there for me on an otherwise uneventful Tuesday or Wednesday evening, ready to provide entertainment and good feels."}
{"text":"awesome staff. best vibe around. great tunes. wide range of choices. Best wednesday night in the city. Go enjoy."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to stop for a drink or 2 after dinner. It's small but they have a solid variety of beers on draft including Grist House and Arsenal cider house. The band was great, not so loud that you couldn't talk. Apparently they don't have a full kitchen but the food we saw looked and smelled delish. And much to the delight of my husband, they have free popcorn. Fun, chill place to end the night."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. Being new to Pittsburgh we bought a bunch of Groupons to try new places in town. We decided to check out the Park House for a bite to eat and a few drinks. What a joke. Even though the Groupon included menu items, they don't have a kitchen. They have a microwave on the bar and all of their food choices are microwave. Gross, and it's a dirty, sketchy bar on the corner of East Ohio and Cedar. Never again ... They can keep the other Groupon. Maybe they can use the money to buy some real food."}
{"text":"Get to the Park House and try the new Golani Platter--it's very tasty and healthy---unbelievable, but true!  You won't even feel guilty about getting that second or third beer when you order this.  The platter includes a Spinach patty mixed with carrots, celery, red onion, Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, lightly fried in olive oil served with chopped tomatoes, feta cheese and your choice of regular or spicy hummus and pita bread.  Even if you think it's not your thing, try it and you'll be pleasantly surprised.    You won't find this anywhere else in Pittsburgh, let alone at another bar!  So, go ahead, order the Golani, get that extra beer, and enjoy the friendly atmosphere at the Park House!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to leave this review simply because I'm afraid my favorite local spot will get too popular! The Park House is awesome. The food is simple and tasty and the beer selection is great. Not sure what you want? Jeremy or one of the other super friendly and knowledgeable bartenders will give you a taste and help you decide. Not hungry enough for dinner but want some snacks with your beer? Peanuts and popcorn are on the house. Trivia on Tuesdays and Bluegrass on Wednesdays are both a great time. Finally, I cannot say enough about the service here. Z and his staff are friendly and attentive. They go out of their way to make you feel at home and get your served quickly. Definitely stop by and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is like none other! Bar, yes-but so much more! Great food! Great people! It's the Pittsburgh CHEERS with a kick of Healthy! YEP-I said healthy. For example-the menu is limited, but everything is great!! How about trying the Golani Platter-veggie dish with wonderful spices! Hummus, pita, feta and an amazing spinach patty -the likes I've never had before!  Love it there and would encourage those interested in a bar atmospher with a twist to try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago at a suggestion from a friend who purchased a coupon.......just had some good beer as we had already eaten, however we watched the owner Zamir cooking and said we must come back, which we did this past Saturday night. I had my big fat Pita, my hubby had chicken skewers............next time I\"m having Peace in the Middle East............and the sweet potato fries? some of the best we've ever had.............i love this little place!"}
{"text":"I went to Park House after much internal deliberation. And after reading all the high reviews from fellow yelpers.     This bar is less than 5 minutes from where I live.  I stopped in on a Saturday night and was pleased with the music that was playing and also the fact that the bar was not overcrowded. The bar tender barely acknowledged me the whole night.    There wasn't any free peanuts or popcorn when I visited. Nor did they have the beer that I like on tap.  I did get a very tasty double chocolate stout, which I found to be delicious in every way.  The owner of the place even gave me an annoyed look.  Saturday night is usually a crappy night to try out any new place.  The service was slow but I got the feeling that the bartender couldn't be bothered to wait on me.    I haven't completely written this place off.  I'll just try again during the week."}
{"text":"Having already eaten dinner somewhere else, I decided to walk over to The Park House to check out Pittsburgh's self proclaimed \"Oldest Tavern.\" As far as a straight-up bar review, I was impressed with both the beers they had on tap (20+) and in numerous bottles. Plus, I liked how they have Happy Hour later than most other places, from 6-8 pm ($2 off all drafts).   Always looking to try something new and/or local, I ordered a pint of Helltown Mischievous Brown ale, brewed in Mount Pleasant, PA. Not bad. If you're hungry, you can either grab some complimentary popcorn or peanuts to snack on.   The bartender was very good, as was the variety of music. That, combined with the groups of jolly patrons at the surrounding tables and it's no surprise this is a popular, local hangout. Glad I stopped by."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, always good beers on tap and great Mediterranean food.  I started coming here because a friend was bar-tending and it's become one of my favorites on the north side.  I recommend the gyro if you are eating...or anything really."}
{"text":"After my first visit to the Park House it immediately became my favorite bar in Pittsburgh. The staff really makes this bar for me. They are always extremely friendly, happy to joke around with you, and quick with a refill. The owner, Zamir, is always behind the bar helping out or working in his make shift kitchen to prepare some pretty stellar burgers, sandwiches, and some of the best Middle Eastern fare around.  The Park house has really nice selection of craft beers, all of which are very reasonably priced. I always end up going with a Yuengling because for some reason it just tastes fantastic here. All of their drafts are always served ice cold and taste super fresh.  Just as a heads up, this place is on the small side and it isn't loaded with  tv's (though it does have two small ones above the bar.) This is a great bar to get together with friends, share some laughs, beers, and falafels."}
{"text":"Super welcoming and chill. Staff and clientele were awesome. Pretty good looking menu and we split a small order of perogies waiting for our lyft. AMAZING!! Cool old fashioned popcorn machine. Nice jukebox selection! Cool lay out with beautiful wood work, chandeliers, and ceiling.  Great beer selection.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. They have  been getting a lot of bands to play. Especially font of the Wednesday night Blue Grass jam night. The hummus is great. The staff is exceptionally friendly and knows my name. They have a great beer selection too."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar.  Awesome food handmade with care by Z, good for vegan, veggie, carnivores.  Top notch beer selection and specials.  enjoyed a lot of good bands here too.  nice people, go, you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"You might not know it to look at the place, but The Park House quietly serves up the best falafels in the city. Falafals, at a hundred-year-old North Side dive, really? That's right. The menu is eclectic but accessible - nice mix of worldly Middle-Eastern fare alongside classic pub grub. It's clear that the owner - a gregarious Israeli man who goes by Z - takes a lot of pride in his food, as dishes are meticulously crafted and always served with a smile. Lots of local beers on tap, which is great to see as Pittsburgh's beer scene grows into itself. Bluegrass night is a blast and patrons are always in good spirits. The Park House is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Just your basic neighborhood bar IMO... nothing impressive minus the dynamic of the crowd that I had seen coming in on my very short visit to this place before dinner one night!    Laidback and unpretentious, I love these types of places... however, there seemed to be a few patrons who were ready to fight anyone (which I always frown upon, but guess when they seemed to be chugging beers like prohibition was about to kick in, it is understandable) which made me feel awkward a bit.  Cheap!  We got 2 drinks each and we were still under $20 with good liquor and a more than 20% tip.  That is always a plus.  I highly recommend this little watering hole to anyone!  Cheers!  It actually exceeded my expectations which is very rare with a first visit anywhere!"}
{"text":"I went here for Bluegrass night following Banjo Night at the nearby Elks Club. What a fun night!!! It is a very fun, friendly, music-loving environment. I believe this happens every Wednesday, so definitely check it out! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We visited last night for the bluegrass night. Being that we don't visit the north side very often this bar wasn't bad. Long narrow bar with lots of wood and a few tables to sit at. They had a good selection of beers on tap that were seasonal and would satisfy any beer lover.  The free popcorn and peanuts were a nice touch.  As for the bluesgrass jam night I can't really recommend it. I was worried that it would be a bunch of hipsters standing in a circle pretending to be the Lumineers, and it was. This is not bluegrass.  Also with a name like bluegrass jam it attracts other sparsely washed hipsters like ants to an overripe peach.  I would go back just not for the music."}
{"text":"I love you Park House. You're always so good to me. You treat me right. Your spirits warm my soul. Your beers fill my belly. I've taken so much and all I can give back to you is this shitty review. À tout à l'heure."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and saw the good reviews so I figured we'd check it out. It was bluegrass night, so that was fun. The staff was incredibly nice. Only complaint was the prices were a little high. But maybe that's because we're from Wisconsin. Maybe it's normal for here? Either way, couldn't afford to have more than a couple. Would definitely stop again though if we were in town."}
{"text":"I came and left after seeing all the changes, I was here to check out the place after the hospital mentioned it was a cool bar.  I think all the hype from my colleagues was not justified.........Not a great menu, just a boring bar!!  It's a shame, what happened???? I was looking forward to a great place to hang out, eat and chug beers."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place.  I have never had a bad experience here and the owner and staff are fabulous.  The North Side has struggled for years to try to gentrify and it's been a slow process. If more places like The Park House would open in the neighborhood the effect could be exponential.  I've been a patron for just about a year on the dot.  I can honestly say that I drove by more than a few times and didn't stop (even though friends recommended it) because I didn't know what I would find.  Boy, I wish I had that time back!   I'll start with FREE... popcorn, peanuts in the shell, great people, and music - yes, live music for FREE.  And, it's all good. Now, to elaborate...  I live in Lawrenceville and crossing a river to go to a place in Pittsburgh is nearly unheard of. But, the people here are so awesome, I can't stay away.  Young, old, hippies, hipsters, locals, and happen-uponers all converging to create an amazing atmosphere.  Last night, there was a woman and her family from Seattle in addition to the familiar faces I usually see.  As other reviewers mentioned, it is like CHEERS - it only takes a couple of visits before folks on both sides of the bar know your name and you!    Of course the free snacks are awesome, they're free - and you can just toss your peanut shells wherever you'd like (my mom would be horrified to watch me throw them on the floor :)  BUT, THE MENU... WOAH.  Zamir makes his own hummus, falafel, tabuouli, and golani.  OMG it's ALL FABULOUS!  Last week I tried the golani platter for the first time -- a golani patty, hummus, feta, and tomatoes, served with pita.  The golani made me smile - spinach, carrots, spices, cheese -- it makes you want to eat your veggies!  I really had to decide last night between the golani platter and the Peace in the Middle East (tabouli, hummus, falafel, pita).  I was really craving the \"falafel master\" delicacy, so Peace it was.  Beer. Um, there is a lot of it... imports, crafts, and domestics.  If you can't find something to drink here then you must not be thirsty.  I think there are 20 taps... I've never actually counted, but a chalkboard boasts their fine selection (stop in and count them, and let me know).  I'm a micro dork and have always been completely overwhelmed by my choices during any given beer season.  Also, there is a \"worst beer\" (it's never bad) discounted selection and some \"last chance\" items that are usually around $4/bottle or glass.   Now, music can be a tricky thing. But like everything else here, it's never steered me away.  Every Wednesday is a bluegrass jam in the rear of the establishment.  Mostly it's members of the Shelf Life String Band, but they are often joined by folks who just want to sit in and play.  You may hear some bluegrass versions of Radiohead, The Coasters, Gorillaz in addition to \"trad-grass\" favorites.  Every Friday night there is live music by local and touring musicians and, like the popcorn and peanuts, IT'S ALWAYS FREE!  Bring your appetite and your friends down for a night of great company and amazing atmosphere... I'm fairly certain that you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place back in March.  The beer selection was good and the bartenders are fast and attentive.  The highlight of the night was the falafel I ordered.  It was made by.. I forget his name but he is the Falafelmaster!  I couldn't believe how good it was.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time since last winter... and the feel was completely different. It is not in the best part of town firstly- there are people in front of it begging for money, some people ask you for \"squares\" which I found out are cigarettes- point being I know  cannot dock the restaurant for that- BUT management can take measures to keep the people from being right in front of their door.   Came here on a Tuesday night after a kickball game with my team- I talked this place up because the last time I was here the food, drink, and atmosphere was awesome. This time... not so much.   The bar is understaffed, those who are seated wait like 7-10 minutes to get their drinks; as a bar that serves food- the bartender came to our table like one time every 15-20 minutes; because they have 2 people working here-where it needed to be at least 3-4.   Anyway, it was trivia night when we came here. The trivia, complementary popcorn, and peanuts definitely were an up side that made waiting for drinks and food somewhat better. Their selection of drinks here is superb which is also a big plus.   I ordered 2 orders of falafel without bread; after a long period of time (45 mins) I went to the bartender and asked her about my falafel orderS she only put in an order for one and gave it to somebody else...   All I can say was I was disappointed. But I have been here when there was a band, good service, and really fun atmosphere- I hope its better next time."}
{"text":"Interesting place, with interesting patrons. The drinks are super cheap - and I was pleasantly surprised when I got my bill. There are peanut shells all over the place, I was a bit concerned initially, but then realized that this was acceptable behavior. Completely a chill place, unpretentious, a bit dark, and different than other bars that I usually frequent in the Pittsburgh area. I'm not sure that I'd make a special trip to this place, but it's not like I'm going to try to avoid it. If my path leads me here again, then I'll go with it!"}
{"text":"\"Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood?\" - Gob Bluth.    This place is SO unbelievably cool.  The taps are constantly changing up, the specials are awesome, and my biggest surprise was that the food was amazing.  The waitstaff and bartenders are knowledgeable, efficient and friendly.  And the owner of the bar who doubles as the chef is a charming mofo.  OH, and, you get to throw peanut shells on the damn floor.  I would never have guessed that I would gain such satisfactions from a never ending supply of peanuts and popcorn, but I do.  I really do.  *note: this place would be fucking deadly for anybody with a peanut allergy.*  The crowd is usually awesome and they have live music regularly.  It's in an emerging area of the North Side.  It's an area that really has come leaps and bounds from when I was growing up here, but it can still get pretty sketchy later in the evening.  I say this as a smoker who gets to go outside and watch the circus as it unfolds.  Places like this are why the North Side has always been such an awesome area and will eventually regain the crowds of it's glory days.  It's not like a mirrored-room with polka dot mannequins, but then again, what is?  Oh right."}
{"text":"Stopped by The Park House for the first time this week with my husband. This bar certainly has an eclectic customer ranging from young just-out-of-college kids and uber hipsters to older professionals. They were even hosting a drone flying night, which was a ton of fun to watch. I was looking for a good Belgian on the menu, but since that was challenging to find, I ordered the Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin, which was really delicious. If we weren't planning to go to Nicky's afterwards, I would've ordered a couple of food dishes but just stuck with the Z-Hummus. The hummus was simple and classic but delicious and the pita was served soft and warm. This is a really cool local bar, and I wish that I lived closer to the North Side to check it out more often."}
{"text":"Stopped in to The Park House on a recent Tuesday evening. The place was pretty full with people participating in their weekly Trivia night. Although it looked like a lot of fun, we didn't take part.  My boyfriend was hungry and thirsty. I was just thirsty  Although it was only around 9 in the evening, the majority of people were drinking - not eating. As I mentioned in my first review of this restaurant, the menu is pretty small. Also, all of the food is pretty much prepared by the owner at one end of the bar. He uses microwaves to heat up just about everything. The food isn't bad, it's just not great and there's absolutely nothing special about it. So, do yourself a favor and come here for beer.  My boyfriend ordered the gyro and hummus platter. I noticed that the tzatziki sauce had been sitting out uncovered and underneath a hot light for a significant amount of time before finally being covered by the owner. I found this to be a bit gross, especially since there is dairy in the sauce. By the way, we learned that the sauce is not homemade, but is doctored up by the owner.  The hummus platter came with two warm (microwaved) pitas. The owner noted that he makes his own hummus. It was pretty tasty, but definitely wasn't a plentiful portion.  What I didn't like about this experience at The Park House was that the owner was eating food behind the counter (with gloves) and seemed to be preoccupied with a woman that was sitting near us. I wanted to say something to him about eating with his gloves on, but I felt extremely awkward.  We'll continue to come here, but in the future we will pass on the food."}
{"text":"Found out about the live Bluegrass on Wednesday nights and had to stop in.  Ended up going multiple times to see Shelf Life String Band and enjoy the beer and food.  While there isn't a kitchen, they are able to put together some awesome hot sandwiches and fried (Curley and seasoned were both very good).    Wednesday nights seem to draw the same crowd week after week and everyone was friendly.    If you are in the area, give this a shot!"}
{"text":"Some may describe this place little hipsters paradise in the middle of the Northside. I've been a sporadic customer of The Park House since I moved to Pittsburgh, initially right up the street, 7+ years ago. The atmosphere is really great. A nice, historic vibe, and a diverse customer base.  The food is solid, albeit limited due to their small kitchen space. I would recommend the hummus more than anything else. It's the one that that's stood out to us on our visits. Everything else is decent, but nothing special.  My one complaint is the cost of the whisky. I think Laphroaig 10 was $15 for a pour. That's way too pricey for a 10 year old Scotch that's only $50/bottle across the street at the Wine & Spirits. Otherwise, the beer selection is decent, as well as their limited, but decent bourbon selection.   Overall, a great vibe, neighborhoody feel, and decent service will keep us stopping in whenever we're in the area and looking for a small snack and a few drinks."}
{"text":"This place is a blast! A hidden gem of the North Side for sure.   I do have to say, I've only been there on Wednesdays for bluegrass nights, but if that is any indication of how it is the rest of the time, game on! On bluegrass nights, nine to midnight is $2 Yuengling draft, and everyone is always having a good time.   I love the dimly lit, warm atmosphere. They have a good beer selection, and I've not had trouble getting quick service here. As far as food, I've only had the falafel... It was great. It also comes with a roll of pita wrapped up in some delicious hummus. When I ordered, they were actually already tearing down their food station, but they were more than happy to get some stuff back out make something for me.   Oh, and free popcorn and peanuts to soak up all that beer!"}
{"text":"Great popcorn and really good beers on tap. Lots of history, and the staff was very nice. The bartenders came out from behind the bar to get you a new drink. Don't be turned off by the crowd outside - this one is a hidden gem. Darts in the back"}
{"text":"I love this place.  They'll all know your name after the second or third visit and people tend to be very welcoming and open without being too \"Cheers-y\"  Food is above average for a bar, especially the Middle Eastern selections."}
{"text":"I first heard of The Park House, due to their Blue Grass night (Wednesdays). My boyfriend is a big blue grass fan, so we rallied some friends and headed over.  Parking is street, but we didn't have any problems finding a spot.   I love the look of this place. It's so Pittsburgh. (In a fun architecture way, not a dive bar way)  There was a good crowd for the music, but we were still able to get a table with a big group.   As other Yelpers have pointed out, there's free popcorn and peanuts you can help yourself to.  They have a small menu, but the food is good.  We split an order of the hummus. YUM!  A couple friends ordered some sandwiches and they looked really yummy.  The beer selection is quite good, we all ordered some seasonals from various microbreweries. They do have TVs, so you are able to catch a game and grab a bite if you are in the mood.   We had a server who was efficient despite being slammed once the music started. I give her mad props, b/c I was not without a beer throughout the entire set.  That scores major points in my book.  I noted that people also seemed to be getting drinks at the bar timely as well.  All in all The Park House is a decent spot to hangout! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. It's a very cozy, inviting environment with fantastic service.  They have a great selection of beer and they're more than willing to talk you through the process if your palette is in the mood for something specific.You are doing yourself a grave injustice if you just go here for some drinks, though.   Self-service peanuts and popcorn are in the back -- it's a lot more sanitary than the typical stuff sitting on the counters in dive bars across Pittsburgh.   Zamir, the owner, is legitimately the most personable guy I've ever met in the bar scene. The guy genuinely cares about the experience he's providing for you, especially with his food. Everything he creates is right behind the bar freshly and carefully prepared. If you like any type of Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food including hummus, falafel, or gyro, this is the place to get it. If it's not on the menu, you can request golani which is a spinach patty on a bed of lettuce. It's to die for."}
{"text":"Wednesday night is bluegrass music night. Awesome vibe and cheap $2 yuengling drafts until 11. The small stage in the back is right next to the free peanuts so you can throw peanuts at the performers.  They like that !  lol, don't do that but do buy the musicians free beer, they're not getting paid much and I'm sure they will appreciate it."}
{"text":"The floor is covered in peanuts! Is this a employee not doing their job? No, it's that way to give the bar it's unique character. It's a old style bar with a new style jukebox. It is a long tight spaced bar and offers little in entertainment if you want to enjoy that kind of thing. There were a lot of people there so meeting people there isn't a issue, I was told this bar is always packed. The beers and liquor are perfectly priced and I was surprised when people came in to buy cases of beer from the owner. In Pennsylvania you can't buy beer at food store or gas stations, so you have to buy it at a beer distributers or bars. The one bartender did a great job tending to all the patrons at the bar, I just wish he wasn't so pushy when it came to asking \"you want another one?\" I like the bar and I loved the music selection. I would go again, I mean that's the only bar that has peanuts all over the floor."}
{"text":"Love going on Wednesdays for bluegrass. Friendly environment & cheap drinks. Only wish they would have the kitchen open later because I always get there right after they close it up & the food looks good."}
{"text":"This was our last stop on the bar crawl.  They had Pumking in November, among many other great craft brews.  Also, unlimited popcorn and peanuts?  Yes, please.  The only downfall is the noise level.  If you're coming to the neighborhood, this bar would be my first suggestion.  It has a much younger feel compared to James St. and Max's, although I personally love all three."}
{"text":"Went to see a friend's band play and grab a bite to eat. I haven't been here in a while and don't remember the menu having a Mediterranean flair. I ordered the Savvy Serbian which was perfectly grilled with swiss cheese and a roasted red pepper spread on a challah roll. (I think that's what the roll was called.) Either way, it was damn delicious. The falafel was also really good. It tasted really fresh and grainy-in a good way.  Could have used a wee bit more cumin, but it was still really good. The crowd had a good vibe, and the staff were friendly. A true Pittsburgh mainstay."}
{"text":"The Park House, thank the heavens above, is reopened after a 6-month hiatus.  This is my favorite North Side neighborhood bar.  It's convenient to the sports stadiums and the North Side cultural attractions, it's close to bus stops for virtually all the North Side bus routes, and it's the only place in town where you're encouraged to gorge yourself on free peanuts and fling the shells on the floor.  (I suppose you probably shouldn't come if you have a peanut allergy.)  The Park House prides itself on its strong selection of microbrews and craft beers, especially local beers, but you can get pretty good mixed drinks there if beer isn't your thing.  The menu is undergoing a revamping, but the giant and delicious nachos remain.  (The gyros are also pretty tasty, and they had a Thai chicken special the other night that was delicious.)  The interior of the bar is welcoming and classic, with heavy wooden bar and booths/tables, and a painted tin ceiling.    The owner and all the bartenders are super-friendly and nice people.  My husband and I frequent the Park House on game nights.  The crowd tends to be friendly and social, but not staggering drunk or trying to hit on people.  All in all, it's my favorite spot to get a beer or three and watch some football."}
{"text":"The Park House is a unique little place right in the heart of Deutchtown in the Northside. I've been there for post Pirate's Game drinks and also for their bluegrass night (I think it's on wednesdays if I remember correctly). It's an interested place for sure that draws a very diverse crowd. They have quick drink service, and their food is okay (it is bar food after all), my only complaint is the lack of seating. It gets packed and there are only a few tables and seats at the bar. If you're looking for a place that's got a hipster vibe, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"After doing some drinking at some other places, we landed at Park House. Load me up with some more drinks and the free popcorn and peanuts (which you can just toss the scraps on the floor). I'm sold!! The beers were reasonably priced and this was the type of place where you can gather with friends and just hang out. No pressure at all. The lighting wasn't too dark so it felt intimate where you were sitting. Seems like a neighborhood bar where everyone knew each other. If I find myself in the area again I would head to Park House though there was the occasional creeper but I guess you can find them anywhere."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a bunch of times and just recently realized that A:  it exists, and B: it's a bar.  I was encouraged to come here by the insistence of a friend who comes in enough that it's just a matter of time before he has his own personalized mug.    They have a surprisingly excellent beer selection, mostly micros.  The drafts aren't cheap, at $5-$8 a draft but Happy Hour is from 6-8pm and is $2 off a draft.   We also tried the food.  While nothing to write home about, it's not bad by any means.  Decent falafel, hummus, lamb gyro...very Middle Eastern-centric.  I'm pretty sure I also ate my weight in peanuts and popcorn.  I don't necessarily know that Park House will enter in my regular rotation, but I will absolutely join my friend in support of his quest for the mug."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a bar where you can eat unlimited salty popcorn and unlimited peanuts for FREE!  AND you can throw the peanut shells on the floor...just like home.  I mean, not really, that's just the clothes in my closet.    The atmosphere is like one of those bars where you know half the people come in there every night.  There's even mugs for them!  Being an outsider was okay though, no weird looks for the regs, all are welcome!  Beer on tap are mixed between the regulars: Yuengling, Mad Hat, Guiness and lots of seasonal and rotating beers.  I love a place with a good draft offering.  I'm way more into a draft than a bottle.  Don't ask me why...maybe because the gulps can be bigger:)  Perks: Non smoking, best bar choice on East Ohio and, of course, FREE popcorn and peanuts...did I mention that yet?!  It's definitely a great place to chill out with friends on a Saturday night, and eat a crap load of popcorn!"}
{"text":"Ahh the Park House.  Oh so you say you are looking for a bar? Wait what's that, you would like to have a live blue grass night?..Okay Okay...hold up..you want an historic building to house it all? Well then my friends I have a place for you.   Grab your shoes and wallet and make your way there. Hungry? Get a Park House burger or even a Mexican War Street burger..hell try out the hummus..it's all great. Don't let the humble sized kitchen fool you..it cranks out some great meals.   Great for those who prefer a manly dart board aka a non electric one. Terrific for those who prefer imported beer from all over. If you like free peanuts and popcorn..don't pass this place up.   The very environment the bar unintentionally spews from the walls themselves will leave you wanting to come back. Think of the show Cheers, the edginess of Ireland and the heart of folk all bended together (for 2-4 mins depending on the blender) and you my friends have the Park House."}
{"text":"Fun bar, and instead of typical bar food they lean towards Greek dishes. The blue grass jam on Wednesdays is a lot of fun and not too loud to still enjoy a conversation. Decent beer prices, pretty good selection."}
{"text":"Only groups for trivia night. Unless you're okay with meeting random people at the bar, then by all means stay. Just make sure you're watching the game primarily then pipe in when you know the answer and people next to you have absolutely no idea what the answer is.  Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and know the final bonus round question worth a lot more... Also go on live music night...it's free, the music isn't the greatest, but when it's free it's at the very least a good laugh when you've got friends to chill with, watch the game - Pirates for me is always the go to. Oh and did I mention that draft Yuengling is only $2! Doesn't get much better than that on the Northside ladies and gents! Hope you enjoy the hole in the wall as much as I did!"}
{"text":"Awesome joint for some good light food and some amazing beers. Owner does a great job offering some top shelf beer on draught and in bottles. Free peanuts and popcorn thrown in for great customer service. The place doesn't ever say they offer 4 star cuisine so don't complain when you don't get it. Grab a drink and relax in an awesome old school bar."}
{"text":"The Park House is a great place to drink. They have a very good beer selection and even though the kitchen is a 4 foot by 4 foot square behind the bar the food is really good.   They have all you can eat Popcorn and Peanuts so you will never be in want of something to snack on while drinking your favorite beer.   They have live bands several times a week my favorite being Tuesdays which often features local Blue Grass musicians.    The down side to this place for me is that it's a little on the expensive side. They have a majority of their beers that are 6+ bucks a pint which a bit much. You can get some for $4.50 - $5  but it cuts your selection significantly. It definitely makes you think twice before going here often. I just wish all their beers were under $5 because I would probably try and go here more often.    Over all it's a great bar the owner is a nice guy and you're going to have a great time."}
{"text":"What a find! I looked at the bar menu and expected the typical, burgers, fries etc. I found great Mediterranean food. Will definitely be regulars for the \"Naked Falafel\"!"}
