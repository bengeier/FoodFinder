{"text":"Wings are amazing one of the main reasons we frequent this restaurant. Tuesday 1/2 price deal is worth stopping by."}
{"text":"I was actually recommended to go here, and if the recommending party wasn't joining us I'd have thought I had wrong them in some way.   This was where Fox and Fiddle was a few years ago. I believe it had been left without any tenant for some time and now it has become Big Daddy's. It looks cheesy as you pull in the driveway into a not fully paved parking lot it appears that Big Daddy's also serves Wing Machine wings and Panzerotto Pizza pizza. So, I knew I was in for something special. The signage was also pretty sweet with the Big Daddy's sign duct taped ontop of the old Fox and Fiddle sign.   As I walked up to the entranceway I was greeted with a stench of stale cigarette, I carried on, I don't know why at this point, maybe just not to embarrass the recommender of this establishment. The place was absolutely empty, two elderly women walked out as we walked in, and this was lunch hour. Across the road is the old Tannery, consisting of many offices and businesses. No one ventured across the road. I think this was foreshadowing the meal that was going to follow.   As we were seated and asked our beverage of choice, we weren't handed any menus. Luckily we werent in any kind of a rush. The menus came and the server read the specials to us from his iPhone. I ventured to try the veal parm sandwich, my wife a chicken club. Mine came, one piece of veal with saut√©ed veggies on top under that looked like an open hot dog bun, for $12. The meat was thin and over fried, the veggies surprisingly cooked to perfection, still a little crunch to them. The bread seemed like it was frozen and nuked to be served. My wife was none too impressed with her club on untoasted white bread either, and told me that the person that recommended this place is not allowed to choose the eating establishments anymore.   I believe this establishment is a \"happening\" bar at night from what I could make of the conversation some of the employees were having. I left this place feeling pretty gross like I was in a cigarette smoke chamber and just had that gross feeling on my skin. I was excited to come home and shower after my meal, which just seems like an odd thing to say."}
{"text":"Three strikes and your out.  #1) Bought a group buy for this place a while back and was impressed that the place was so busy. Watching the food come out the plates were full and looked inviting. Everyone leaving was taking food home with them. Food was good and hot when it came out. My order wasn't available that night so I changed it to a pizza. Easy enough, wrong pizza order came out. Wasn't sure at the time if I screwed up or if the server did. The rest of my table was happy with the food. My husband actually said \" other than the screw up with your meal this place is good, I think we found a new favorite\"   Again group buys came up and I bought 2 this time.   #2) Place was empty of anyone eating. My husband ordered ribs and a half chicken. Long after the order was put in the server came back and informed us that there was no chicken that night. He was a bit surprised and had wings instead. I had the halibut and fries and it was alright but one side of the halibut was so hard I wasn't able to eat it. The server mumbled and was very timid.   #3) Again the place was void of anyone eating. Same server, still timid and unsure of himself. Ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and what a disaster, it was like they took a can of cambells soup and used it for a sauce. Lots of vegetables in it and I couldn't tell the onions from the noodles, there was so many of them. Had chicken with it and the chicken was very low grade, lots of grisle in it. My husband ordered the veal parmesan. Long after ordering again our timid server came back mumbling about no veal so my husband changed his order to steak. No question of how he wanted it or what he wanted with it. So I questioned the server what he gets with it. It was decided he would have a baked potato. Then the server comes backs and asks how he would like his steak cooked. That cracked me up because I was telling my husband at the very moment that the steak was going to come out well done cause the server never asked how he wanted it. Food comes out with fries and the steak was well done even though my husband ordered it rare. At this point steam is screaming out of my husbands ears. We didn't make a scene, just ate what we could and got the hell outta there.   A couple of things that have been consistant with this place is the lack of people dining and the large amount of people drinking at the bar. Always lots of people bellied up to the bar. Oh and they are 3 for 3 of not having food on the menu available. Everytime we leave there is kitchen staff smoking out back. Gross."}
{"text":"I was at a meeting in another location of the building this restaurant is in, and one of the attendees suggested we get a bite to eat.  Decor is old school pub. Waitress was friendly and attentive. She recommended the soups, as they are homemade, and she was going to have it for lunch herself when she was on break. Not being a huge soup fan (at all, really I think there's 2 soups I can tolerate), but not being particularly hungry, I thought it was worth a whirl.  I chose that day's special which was the roasted vegetable cauliflower. Lets just say I didn't expect green soup! However, it was absolutely delicious. If I wasn't in polite company or had it for take-out I would have licked the bowl.   If this restaurant was just around the corner I would be a regular... just for the soup."}
{"text":"The food was 'okay' and that's the best I can say for it. Certainly not bad, but nothing I'd want to pay nearly $10 a sandwich for again. My real problem was with the service.   The place advertises itself as a 'Family Restaurant and Bar'. We were with my 2.5 year old son and 6 month old. Considering it specifically said it was a family restaurant, we assumed families were welcome. Crazy us. When we got in the place, the only people there were about 6 men watching hockey and drinking. No big deal. Hey, if I didn't have two kids to lug around, I'd have been right there with 'em.   Okay, so my toddler was not in a great mood and he was being loud. Admittedly, he was not behaving to the best of his ability, but he certainly was not throwing a full blown tantrum. Initially, my husband was gong to take him outside, but the waitress (who was also the bartender) wanted to hurry us through our order so we stayed to order. When she came back she actually told us to keep our kid quiet or the other patrons would leave.   Now, I do not ever wish to ruin someone else's dining experience. But when you are a FAMILY restaurant, that comes with a certain level of crying kids. But more than that, her rude behavior and obvious desire to cater only to the bar patrons was enough to make me see red. She was not helpful nor friendly, and I strongly suggest that no one take that 'family restaurant' sign seriously. What they really want to be is a sports bar that caters to the 'day drinking' crowd."}
