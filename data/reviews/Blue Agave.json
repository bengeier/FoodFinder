{"text":"Taco Tuesday is great. Freshly made chips and salsa. Mojitos are the best!  Returned for second trip and had delicious chicken fajitas. Ate a second meal of great leftovers."}
{"text":"This was the worst food we have ever eaten in Las Vegas! The margaritas were weak and too sweet. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We came here to try it since my friends suggested it and it was at Palms where we were gonna go for the night anyways. The waiters. Eh...could have been better. Slightly friendly but very unattentive. Maybe cuz they were about to close when we got there. Ha. I think it's a 2 different restaruants in 1? Not sure...have to check on that. The food was decent but filling. We ordered a 5 combo and a quesadilla and we could not move after eating. One of my friends even ordered the gigantic margarita, which he had to take togo. I couldn't even drink after this meal. Cheap and filling for vegas, not for picky eaters."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great food and cocktails! Definitely will go again and highly recommend! YUM!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, drinks, service, music and ambiance. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in before a concert Friday night. We walked into a line of people waiting but the hostess still saw us and acknowledged us promptly. There was going to be a long wait, but we deiced to try the bar. One seat was available but the couple next to us was just finishing up-good luck for us. We ordered mojitos and margaritas, really good! I wanted one more and decided maybe not since I was the driver!They have a great selection of different tequilas lined up on the wall. Lots to choose from. We had an order of guac, one of the best I have had in Madison. I love lime in guac and this is very tasty. My friend and I shared the tilapia tacos. Mmmmm! Not fishy at all, very fresh ingredients and a nice array of sides. Our other friend enjoyed the enchiladas suisa. I thought the service was very good. Friendly and attentive. The hostess even asked us if we wanted a table a couple of times when were were waiting at the bar. We were happy at to stay at the bar. I really like this place and will be back again! Great place to eat before a show at the Majestic or just hanging out downtown."}
{"text":"Update. Went back. Food was good. Service wasn't. It was empty and the waitress complained how busy it was. It was a hassle to get water, chips and the check. Bummer.   Went on a snowy Saturday afternoon. Staff was great Fabian waited on us and was cool enough to give us happy hour prices 30 mins early. Got the molechete on his recommendation.  Great choice...kinda like whole fajitas in a big cast iron pot. Whole piece of grilled skirt steak, chicken, cactus, queso,  halepeno, onions, chorizo and 3 bacon wrapped shrimp served with tortillas and beans/rice. Service was speedy. Lots of Mexican music. Nice place. I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Owner was there with his wife working and both were excellent and ensued everything was perfect. Prices reasonable and food was outstanding.   Would highly recommended.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Mexican food... it can be bland and pedestrian. Sometimes it feels like the meal came out of a box. This was not the case at Blue Agave. Not only was the food delicious but the staff and the ambience are quite nice. Nothing fancy, just as Mexican should be served.  It was a cold and raw evening. We scored a nice booth and the waitress was very attentive. I started off with a Margarita which was a good size and was quite tasty. Unfortunately there were some yummy chips and dip on the table, which we quickly devoured. We ate way more chips than we should have. Next time, I will be more careful. Yeah, yeah, yeah...  Our dinners arrived and they were rather large. My guy ordered the Tilapia Agave which had shrimp and a cilantro sauce. The fish was moist, the flavors were complimentary, and sides of rice and veggies were perfectly prepared.  I ordered the Grilled Steak Fajita. It came with all the standard fixin's and the steak was juicy and quite flavorful. I ate about a third of my meal and took the rest home. We both enjoyed our second meal as much as the first.  The young woman who waited on us was very helpful. She was busy but we never felt rushed.   There is no doubt we will return."}
{"text":"We tried this place a few weeks ago and it was good. The portions are absolutely massive! And the chips and salsa are amazing. I got the chicken posole soup, and it was okay. My disappointment was in the guacamole bar! We came because we heard they may guac at the table, but they weren't doing it the night we came. It looks like they might only offer it on weekends? Not sure, but definitely want to go back to try. Come hungry and you'll enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Have tried many Mexican restaurants in Madison and hands down this is the best. Owner was very attentive to our requests and questions. Margaritas and food were excellent. Will definitely return and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am very perplexed by the hype around this place?  We must have gone there on an off night or something.  The salsa was mediocre and my partner's carnitas was legit huge chunks of fatty, unflavored pork. The rest of the meal was \"meh\". It was a Sunday night, I think, so not a prime time but we were very underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Our supper club ate at Blue Agave last night.  After a bumpy start it ended well. There were six of us and we did not have reservations.  We arrived at 6:30 and were told there would be a 25 minute wait. They would be able to accommodate us since there were two tables of four next to each other which had come in at the same time. We decided to stick around since we love Mexican and parking had been hard to find for some of us.  We waited in the lounge area which is on the upper floor.  This is basically a balcony on the second floor which looks down on the main dining area. There's no service up there and you need to trudge up and down the stairs to get to the bar. After 30 minutes we looked down and could see the two tables of four next to each. Both had their leftovers boxed up and were chatting. So the estimate of 25 minutes seemed pretty reasonable.  By this point there were a number of patrons in the lounge and at the bar waiting. The space at Blue Agave is not large. I'm not sure if the patrons at those two tables were just clueless or had the attitude that they had paid for their meal and therefore were entitled to the space as long as they wanted. However, it was another 30 minutes before either table showed any interest in moving. The staff cleared off the tables and you could see them debating on what to do. I could see their dilemma. If they give us those 2 tables of 4, they are wasting 2 seats. Plus, the logistics of the room means moving those tables will make it very difficult for anyone to move around them. Also right next to it is a group of four at two tables of two. Those patrons had finished eating and already had boxes for their leftovers. So I completely understood when they made the decision to give away one of 'our' tables to another group. Surely that last table will get up and then they can split those two tables to make a table of 6 for us and a table of 2 for others.    I kid you not, when I tell you that last table also lingered another 30 minutes after they had paid. It was 90 minutes before we were seated. Obviously if we would have known when we arrived we would have gone elsewhere. But at some point we were committed. I don't blame Blue Agave for their estimate as they were spot on for when folks were done eating. I do blame their inexperience in not realizing how long some patrons will linger once they have finished.  Once we were seated, things went well. The guacamole was creamy, delicious and amazing. The salsa bright and fresh. Chips were light and crunchy. Margaritas were a mite sweet but tasty. Service was friendly and efficient. My one complaint was that there was sour cream covering my fajita burrito. I guess I should have realized this would be the case but the menu had not mentioned it, so I failed to ask them to leave it off.  I'll probably go back and try it again, but I would be reluctant to go there with a group larger than four."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great ! Tere was very friendly! The key lime margarita is amazing! The shrimp on the Enchiladas campeche was so full of shrimp, it overflowed my plate! I'll be back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Thursdays are margs and tacos night for me and the hubs, so it was time to check this one off the list.  I have to say, overall, I was disappointed. I REALLY wanted to like this place. Margs were on special and were decent, though our server was clueless about anything we asked about. I think they noticed this and sent someone else over to take care of us for the rest of the meal.  Ordered the cheese dip which was good - kinda hard to mess that up. For our meals, we ordered the molcajete (a fave of mine) and the enchiladas.  Enchiladas were ok, but the real miss here was the molcajete. I order this dish almost anytime I see it on a menu. The first thing I noticed was the the chicken, steak and napoles all came out as whole pieces - as in, an entire chicken breast in the dish, not cut up at all. This made it a little cumbersome to eat, but what was most disappointing was the lack of any flavor. I've never eaten such a dull molcajete dish. I didn't even bother taking the leftovers  home.  So, our search still continues for the best Thursday night venue."}
{"text":"My companions arrived on a Monday, which was convenient, since they have 2 for 1 house margaritas on Monday. The margaritas were definitely above average, and the cucumber margarita was described as very good. As we pored over the menu, which seemed fairly authentic though certainly somewhat upscale, we were treated to a delicious batch of chips with what I think was homemade salsa.   I ordered the Steak Tampiqueno, which was delicious and came with a rather large portion of steak, rice, beans, tortillas, and enchildas that I stretched into 2 meals. It came with a green soup whose name I don't know and which I'd never had before, but the soup was scrumptious.   One of my friends ordered a chicken taco, which she liked, and an order of Mexican street cord, which was excellent.   Another friend ordered the molcajete. This was among the priciest items on the menu, but was served with a huge portion of steak, pork, and seafood cooked in a stone bowl. It was very flavorful and delicious, and probably could be stretched into 3 meals.   When we asked for hot sauce, they gave us an amazing homemade sauce rather than Tapatio.   All in all, this is an excellent restaurant. It is definitely a little more pricey than typical authentic Mexican restaurants in town, but the excellent service, high quality food, and huge portions make up for it! Recommended."}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant! We come here quite often. From the kids menu to one of our favorite dishes, molcajete, the food is always on point. The drinks are pretty good too. The margaritas are great, especially during happy hour. I love the fact that it's a family owned and run. The service is always good too, prompt and friendly. We definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Eh. I can't really say much about this place. The hostess was rude and looked at us like we didn't have a place in their restaurant. Once seated the waiter was very friendly and helpful. The actual food was mediocre and I'm not a fan of chili powder around the rim of my margarita, so I wish I would have seen that on the menu before ordering one. I think their outdoor area leaves much to the imagination so I would suggest sitting inside. I don't think this place was terrible but I definitely think better options are in Madison."}
{"text":"The food and the staff are amazing! Definitely recommend the table side guacamole and fajita nachos. The only recommendation I have if you get takeout, check your items to make sure the food was made correctly. We had a couple of items missing from our order, however, we let the staff know and they made our items quickly and added in a churro!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! I first stopped in to meet friends for lunch drinks last week. The pitcher Margarita special they had when I went in was well worth it and delicious. I asked our server if he'd be in on Monday and when he said yes I told him that I'll see him on Monday. I took my girlfriend in on Monday for dinner and when our server greeted us he acknowledged me, showing that he remembered me from the other day. Service was wonderful. Chips and salsa were brought over as soon as we sat down. Our server was great at suggesting items without being salesy or pushy about it: \"margaritas?\" ... \"yes, of course, thank you!\" \"appetizers such as our table-side guacamole?\"... \"You read our minds!\". The chips and guacamole was perfect. The margaritas on the rocks were delicious too. I was happy to see that they have Pacifico, and on tap too. My girlfriend and I shared the enchiladas and the molcajete. We've been to Mexico plenty of times and have eaten at many authentic restaurants down there, and Blue Agave definitely embodies great, authentic Mexican cuisine. The flavors of the mocajete were phenomenal. Very well done on everything. I'm happy that you offer lunch. You'll definitely see me in often we are business neighbors (I'm right around the corner). Cheers!"}
{"text":"Man where do I start?  After reading a glowing review for Blue Agave in the Isthmus I thought we might get a place that would give us some semblance of a modern Mexican place and not another Laredo's.  The Isthmus must just default to a glowing review if a place is in downtown because they get free drinks.  Blue Agave could only strive to be Laredo's.  It started with the overly friendly white boy barkeep that must be stone deaf and thought he was applying at Chili's. I ordered their standard marg just kick things off and he asked if I wanted it frozen. Bad sign for openers. They didn't have a top shelf marg that I could see, but it is nearly impossible to read their menu with a 0.25 font size. Hell even Chili's will make you a top shelf marg. Anyway, I tell him I wanted it served up and he laughed and brought it to me on ice. I told him again that I ordered it up and he laughed again, walked away and poured out the drink he had made and made another one...warm with no ice.  Obviously not a real bartender, or not a good listener. I drank it just because it was obvious this place sucked and I wanted to get this over with ASAP. Oh and the marg was a sweet and sour mix special and served warm, it was genuinely awful. So they pride themselves with tableside guacamole - something seemingly new to the Isthmus staff but was new about 3 decades ago.  We got our guac with mango because as my wife added \" they are in season\".  At Blue Agave frozen mango is always in season!  We may have got about  two small pieces of frozen mango in ours. But the guac was the star of the meal.   I got carne asada.  A standard that even Laredo's can do a decent job on.  What  I got was a large sheet of work boot leather with rice and beans.  I really laughed when I saw it.  So pathetic and sad. The poor busboy had to give up his shoes because someone ordered something besides fajitas.  My wifefriend got a fairly decent mole enchilada, nice flavor that was a bit unique but the mole was an afterthought.  One last thing. I love a place that pays attention to detail.  Blue Agave was using someone's iPhone for the music track (probably in violation of RIAA - but I'm sure they've got bigger things to worry about), which wouldn't have been a big deal except the person's phone kept getting texts and the music kept stopping, followed by a \"bing!\" And then resume.  But no one seemed to mind because they had frozen margs with a hint of rail swill tequila with only an old memory of an agave plant and a place other than Loredo's to get guacamole.   So if you find yourself in here because you trust the Isthmus restaurant reviews one piece of advice ... get a beer and a bowl of the guac and go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"We discovered this hidden gem by accident when all the nearby restaurants had long wait times. I am so glad to have found this place! It's our new go-to place when we go downtown, especially if we are entertaining out-of-town guests. Great food, friendly service, super-fun atmosphere and the best margaritas around! Try the table side guacamole! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great drink specials and good food.  However, my experience was poor, hence the low rating.    We were served by the owner who was friendly but seemed distracted.  We had to ask several times for items like water, silverware, etc.  We were never asked about the food, never offered another drink or water, etc.  As a server, that's just basic restaurant service 101.  We would have ordered more drinks but were so unenthused about the whole thing that we decided not to.  I've never been so annoyed about service that I haven't wanted to spend any more money at a place - my standards are pretty low because I know how tiring food service jobs can be sometimes.   We all enjoyed our food, but it's worth noting that it was no better than many other small, family owned Mexican restaurant in Madison.  The difference at Blue Agave is you're paying double the price.  However, if you're intent on sticking to the downtown area, it is better than Pasqual's, Canteen, and BelAir.  BelAir and Canteen are superior if you're looking for more creative takes on taco fillings, but for all else and traditional tacos, Blue Agave is second only to A La Brasa.   When we were leaving, we heard a table say they loved their service - they had one of the regular servers. So it seems the service in general is probably fine.    I'd consider going back for some of their drink specials, if a friend insisted.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the food was good and the other employees were friendly and responsive.  Too bad they weren't our server!"}
{"text":"This location isn't here anymore...thanks for not updating blue agave very professional of you"}
{"text":"Being a block from the square can be a location disadvantage.  However, they prove if you plate tasty food, you will fill the seats.  We live close and tried takeout the first time.  It was recently opened and not too busy.  A couple weeks later we wanted to try the full experience at the restaurant, but the word was out and they were on an hour wait.  It's worth the wait and traveling 2 blocks from the Capitol.  Most authentic tastes we've had in Madison.  Try the cactus (Nopal)!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food I've found in Madison. Tacos de carne asada were really good. Also, the best guacamole I've ever had. Service is wonderful too."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food ...happy hour margaritas were wonderful..Our servers were awesome. The ambience is just perfect. My hubby had steak fajitas... piping -sizzling hot ...excellent and fresh. I had the enchilada suizas"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance. Went on a Saturday night, it was busy but there is a upstairs lounge with tables, white couches and blue lighting to hang out in while you wait for the hostess to come get you. There was a bar up there but it wasn't set up to serve drinks so we had to get them downstairs which was a little cramped since it is a narrow space. We ordered the table side Guac with pineapple. Very delicious! Could just eat that for dinner and be good.  I ordered the Fajita Salad and asked that they make it vegetarian which they said they could do. It was good but the fajita veggies could have been a little hotter. FYI it was served on spinach leaves not lettuce which was good but not necessarily what you expect when you first think salad. After we ate we went upstairs to hang out some more without holding the table. Someone even came up and asked if we needed anything which was nice they were checking in but not hovering over us. Will be back to try more menu items and eat delicious guac!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite authentic Mexican restaurants. The staff are extremely friendly and give great suggestions. Big portions that are worth the full belly. Taking home the left overs!!"}
{"text":"This place was super cute. The table-side guacamole was fresh and delicious, and the portions were generous. It had this great smokey flavor from the roasted corn with a bit of zippiness from the the jalapenos. I love that the owner was super friendly!"}
{"text":"This is tan bueno. The margaritas are awesome. El guacamole es sobresaliente. And the enchiladas suizas are great. COME EAT HERE."}
{"text":"They try. Not sure how the bar scene is but the tacos are horrendous. The space is basically the same as it was for the New Orleans restaurant but just Mexican now. TVs playing sports behind the bar. They do have their own hot sauce which was decent. But the tacos were some of the worst I've ever consumed.   Maybe some tequila late night with music would work but skip the food."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but cannot. Tonight was the second time my family and I went there. I was reluctant to go there a second time because the service the first time was poor. Both times the food was good, if you like Mexican food and don't care about service you will like this place. We had the fajitas, carne asada tacos, carne asada and the table side guacamole, all were good. Tonight my wife and I got our drinks between 10 and 15 minutes after our kids got their drinks. We had to ask for our drinks, apparently they were ready but just sitting at the bar. They forgot the habanero salsa and and jalapeños that I ordered and paid for. They forgot the corn tortillas for the carne asada meal."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch this week and was neither blown away nor disappointed.  The lunch menu is limited with lunch specials coming only with choice of beef or chicken and entrees consisting of your typical mexican-american fare (burritos, chimichanga, etc).  There website opens with \"gourmet mexican fare\" but the lunch menu definitely doesn't reflect this.  I opted for the burrito colorado as it at least offered me a chance to try the carnitas that it was stuffed with.  The large burrito was topped with a red colorado sauce and accompanied by rice and very bland refried beans.  While the pork was tasty, I wouldn't call it \"carnitas\" as it didn't have any of the crispiness that it should.  I will say that their housemade hot sauce (available by request) was exceptional.  It brought the right amount of heat to the dish and was a needed addition to the refried beans. Service was friendly and with only a few tables occupied, the food came out extremely fast. In reviewing the dinner menu, there are a few things that sparked my interest and would warrant a return visit so I will update my review accordingly. But in a city with a plethora of other mexican restaurants to choose from, Blue Agave may have an uphill battle on their hands to try to differentiate themselves from the rest."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a friend's recommendation (who knew about the bad experience with the other Tequila/Mexican spot on the square) for lunch today. The food tasted great, the chips were crisp and fresh and the salsa tasted great. The mushroom quesadilla on the Lunch Menu was the sh**. The gentleman offered to add some grilled onions and switched the rice out with beans which made for a really good meal. Will definitely be back for more, especially the happy hour with tequila samples at the bar. This place has the ingredients for a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"So nice we tried it twice in one week! My boyfriend and I love Mexican food and we were pumped a new spot opened up in our neighborhood following the flop of another spot off the square that focused on fusion.   Our first stop was during a Monday-night snowstorm. We were the only people in the restaurant, but our food came out fresh and fairly quickly. We started with the queso dip which was a little salty but perfectly smooth and a perfect pair for the complimentary chips and salsa.   My tinga chimichanga was hilariously large and served with similarly gargantuan portions of rice and beans. The rice seems to be made with fresh veggies and the beans were smooth. The tinga had a knock-out flavor and a good hit of spice from the big chunks of chipotle peppers. Definitely the best tinga I've ever had and I was pumped to have a complete second meal the next day. My boyfriend really liked his mole enchiladas.   Our next visit was after watching the Parade of Nations during the opening ceremony of the winter Olympics. Blue Agave was halfway between the bar where we were watching and home so we popped in again. We had the same server (hooray for Fabian!) and I had the same thing. My boyfriend gave the regular chicken chimichanga a try and it was definitely more mild but still had a little bit of that nice burn on your tongue. I prefer the tinga between the two but would happily mow down on either.   Blue Agave has some great specials and I'm looking forward to hitting it up for happy hour for some half-priced appetizers - $4 guac and $2.25 queso sound like the perfect way to kick off the night."}
{"text":"Legit some of the best tacos I've ever had for that price! Really good Mexican food! I recommend it! The waiter was friendly and the service was pretty quick. 3 tacos were pretty filling. Delicious, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you love Mexican food, then you have to try this place. Loved the ambiance of the place. We went at lunch time so not too busy. They make guacamole right at your table and it is delicious. For the main course I order the tacos. Tilapia was delicious as well as the chicken. The tacos came with onions, cilantro, pico and hot salsa (it was so hot I was only able to use maybe a small spoonful, but it was delicious). They even have happy hour specials everyday on different drinks. I will definitely be coming back for more, especially for that guacamole."}
{"text":"Great service and food was good. We especially liked the table side guacamole - perfectly seasoned, the creamy flan, chicken noodle soup and posole with good broth. Chips, salsa, queso, and Mexican rice were made just as I like it. Everyone in our party seemed to enjoy their dishes- the enchiladas, fajita salad, nachos del jefe, Chile's rellenos. My Milanesa was okay and it needed more seasoning. They don't take reservations but they were able to accommodate our large party of 9 last minute. Great place for Mexican food if ever in Madison Wisconsin."}
{"text":"I really liked the owner's dedication to his dad on the menu. Congratulations to him on making papi proud and best of luck.  The servers and staff were friendly and kind. We brought our 8 mo baby on a Friday night which may have been a mistake, because he got fussy, but no one seemed to mind or made us feel uncomfortable. Probably best for adults in the evening though.  The green posole that came w the carne asada was excellent. I had the enchiladas mole, delicious, nicely plated. Nice quality ingredients, they were filled with perfectly cooked tender chicken, not unidentifiable mush. We also had a pitcher of margaritas- they aren't messing around!  Table side quac was delicious but a lot for two people (not complaining).  I'll return for food and drinks for sure. Look forward to sampling the selection of tequila!"}
{"text":"I took my fiancee there for a surprise party and Jose and his staff were incredibly accommodating. The tamales, enchiladas, chimichangas and tacos were great, as were the multiple flavors (poblano and mango) of guacamole we ordered.  Best place for Mexican food in town!"}
{"text":"Years ago this restaurant and Gardunos required reservations even on weekdays, but the evening of our visit the place was relatively empty.  In fact, for the first 10 minutes there wasn't even a chef.  Our waiter took our orders - house margaritas and combo pan roasts that include crab, shrimp and scallops.  The chef finally made an appearance and both his demeanor and facial expression suggested he would have been happier having a root canal.  Prices have increased since our last visit.  There was a lot of seafood in the pan roasts, but we agreed these just aren't as good as in the past."}
{"text":"Our first visit and will definitely return. Food was amazing and service was exceptional. Table side guacamole is a must and splurge for the margarita pitcher! Thanks to Fabian for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner, party of 3, prior to BritBeat concert at Monona Terrace. Arrived ~5:30 pm, placed dinner order ~5:50 pm, and left ~6:50 pm. Wasn't very busy but service was slow, and we had to go up to the bar to get the attention of our server a few times. Food arrived hot -- one order of chicken fajitas, one steak fajitas, and one cheese enchilada with mole sauce. The fajitas were a much better choice. I didn't care for the cheese enchilada, but cheese was the only vegetarian option so it was kind of a gut bomb and I couldn't bring myself to finish it nor did I want to take my leftovers home. The house margarita 2 for 1 happy hour special was a premix drink (I asked), unexpected at a Mexican restaurant. Tasted like the premix I buy at Costco, which isn't entirely bad but less than what I expect when I go out. We ordered one set of the BOGO margaritas thinking we could split it between two of us -- one for my buddy, one for me. But apparently that's against the rules. The BOGO is strictly enforced per person and the server made it clear she would charge us for 2 margaritas whether or not we chose to drink our 2nd (free) ones or not. Sooooo, whatevs. We each ended up drinking 2 not so great margaritas, which made me further regret ordering one in the first place. The bill for 3 dinners, 4 margaritas (BOGO) and 1 Corona was $60. Won't be rushing back. Happy hour cocktails at Monona Terrace are apparently quite reasonable, so for the next rooftop concert we will pack a picnic and enjoy libations there."}
{"text":"The question is, do we really need another upscale Mexican place on the square?? Probably not, Madison has had a recent influx and I doubt all will succeed. Blue Agave has a sweet happy hour deal of only $4 margs, which would be good, but they are pre-mixed & in a pitcher on the counter, because all of ours were WARM with ice.  Table side Guac is amazing! Creamy, super flavorful and worth it! And huge. Save room. We split 2 orders of tacos for 3 ladies and were stuffed.  Recommend the guac and tilapia tacos however nothing outstanding from the other New Mexican joints."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing food that's not greasy or low quality! Everything tastes fresh and very large portions! The guacamole is to die for ! Pretty much anything you order you will love and they pour the margaritas strong! They have some outdoor seating as well and allow my dogs to come :) also providing them water. A+"}
{"text":"Was wandering around looking for a place to eat and came upon the Blue Agave. Staff was very friendly and food was excellent. I'm glad I stopped in. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"me: remember we talked about where to go night one?   blue agave looked good  gardunos looked like gross tex-mex chain   Brette: yes  me: so my boss wants blue agave too and we meet downstairs to find it and we walk by gardunos   Brette: ok  me: it looks gross and we end up going around the entire casino floor NO BLUE AGAVE! so we ask a Palms employee  Brette: ok...   me: and he says, \"See the neon tequila sign?\" \"It's there\" Oh...ok So this place is right next to Gardunos, and there's no sign so we walk up and get seated we're excited for Blue Agave  Brette: ok  me: So we get our menus, and what does it say on the cover? Where are we? GARDUNOS! wtf   Brette: oy what'd you do?   me: stayed apparently, blue agave is the special menu at Gardunos the stuff you saw online (Palms website)   Brette: that doesn't make sense? was it mediocre?   me: terrible   Brette: oy   me: terrible I was wondering why there was only one yelp review of blue agave when I was researching in my room   Brette: i hope there are 2 now  me: now I know. The Palms website deceives!   Brette: dude, you gotta yelp that   me: maybe I'll just copy and paste this chat in there  Brette: haha it's not worthy of an actual review   me: But I'll get lots of \"funny\" and \"cool\" and maybe some \"useful\"  Brette: haha"}
{"text":"Ok so 3 may seem a little harsh, because this place has a tone going for it. It has a great bar area, comfortable dining area, it's well decorated the staff are friendly and attentive. Where it falls a bit short is the food. $18 for fajitas that in taste and and portion are lacking. The fajita mix I ordered was steak and shrimp. Which included a mountain of onion, three small strips of steak and a few shrimp. There was a small mound of over cooked rice on the hot skillet (which causes it to burn on the bottom) and a cup of beans. The flavor of the beans were good. The chips and salsa were also good. I ordered a piña colada and it was only half blended which big hunks of un drinkable ice in it. This place is on its way, it has the right setting and tons of parking- a little work is needed on the food."}
{"text":"I cannot believe it, most tragic day ever. Found this amazing place only to remember that I live 250 miles away. But I have found heaven here. I have obviously decided to move to Wisconsin, specifically as close to Blue Agave as possible. Today we had the Molcajete and the tacos dorados - and several margaritas, of course. Again, still from New Mexico, so I'm usually a bit forlorn when eating Mexican food, missing home, missing my grandma. This place brought me tromendous joy, a welcoming environment, staff so kind to all of us (even the baby!) I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"I was v disappointed after my visit to Blue Agave, especially after reading all the hype on Yelp.  We went on a Tuesday night for dinner so it wasn't too busy and our party of 5 got seated right away. I'm not sure if our waitress was new but she barely knew the answer to any of our questions and seemed confused most of the time. For example, they had a BOGO deal of margaritas. We had 5 people so we ordered 6 margs. About a half hour or so later someone (not sure if he's the manager?) came and told us the BOGO is actually per person and the server misunderstood. Which all of us were like welp, we can't say no to more margaritas, so we'll get 6 more! They definitely tasted premixed and weren't anything too special but hey, it's a discounted margarita... Who am I to turn it down?   The tacos on the menu showed that they would bring out 3 tacos along with all the fixings, rice and beans. I asked the server if I could do 2 tacos instead of three (and after running to ask her manager), she said that was fine. I ordered 1 vegetarian and 1 grilled shrimp. After we put our orders in, our server came back to tell us they were out of chicken and could only fulfill one order with chicken in it. So most of our table had to adjust their meals accordingly.   Finally after a long wait, all of the meals came out at once, excluding mine. Mine came out maybe 5 minutes after everyone else's ... And it was just veggies on a tortilla and shrimp on a tortilla. And literally NOTHING ELSE. Other people with tacos got their side of rice/beans and all the fixings to on it. I ended up just using their salsas, onions, etc because I wasn't trying to wait even more to finally take a bite out of this already mediocre taco.   Overall, disappointing food and service. With all the other Mexican places near downtown, I don't think I'll be returning to this one."}
{"text":"I went to Blue Agave for the first time yesterday and overall it was good.  Their location is close to the capital and the restaurant was clean. The guacamole portion is humongous, and we all had street tacos.  The vegetarian and chorizo tacos were good, as were the refried beans and toppings (onions, cilantro, HOT sauce).  The tilapia was really salty, but not terrible.  The service was a bit lacking - they forgot our drinks repeatedly and didn't check in very often.  Overall, though, I'd go back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was incredibly impressed! The decor is stunning; the server was super friendly and the perfect amount of attentive and the food was delicious. There is a limited lunch menu, which I did not see on their website or in photos here. I had a lunch special chicken quesadilla plate; the chicken was so tender and flavorful and the cheese was so creamy.  I will definitely be coming back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times to try their food and have always left completely satisfied. The presentation was great and they still manage to keep that authentic Mexican flavor in each and everyone of their meals strongly recommend it. Best Mexican restaurant in town"}
{"text":"The Blue Agave is theoretically the seafood side of the Mexican restaurant, Gardunos, at the south side of the casino. I have friends in the Palms management but I'll tell them the same thing I'm telling you: This is a horrible mistake.  First time I went there (in the company of a columnist for Nevada's biggest circulation paper) I found it very difficult to find service. Finally I was able to order a been and a dozen oysters. The chef literally rinsed the oysters in water. Don't try that at home. Tastes even worse than it sounds. Second time I went there during a three-day alternative music festival. I was dying for some seafood - but should have hit the buffet. Again, sitting at the bar waiting for someone to take my order. It took about 15 minutes for one of the floor waitresses to come by with a menu, half of which was unavailable. (One of the reasons I sat at the bar, or sit at the bar on any night, is for quick service. A huge mistake there.) I ordered a mixed seafood roast, which is a creamy thing most of the casinos have at their seafood bars. It can be quite tasty. In this case, I actually received their version of seafood gumbo, which I grudgingly ate anyway despite a passing resemblence to cat vomit. Also, the margaritas are terrible.  The coolest thing about this place is that all the rock and roll people who wandered in there while I was there had something to laugh about that weekend. Seriously, you will ask out loud if there is service available and then you will wish you hadn't."}
{"text":"Excellent food , service ! Authentic top notch Mexican.my new fav place ! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"When It was open it was magical this is before the whippersnapper started taking over old town Scottsdale me and the Mrs. used to come here and drink all day and pass out damn I miss those days damn these whippersnappers"}
{"text":"Last night we arrived at 6:00 PM as a party of 6.  Put our name in for a table and we were the wait would be 45 minutes.    At 8:15 we were still waiting for a table.  Multiple smaller parties were seated before us but the staff could never seem to figure out how to seat a larger party.  We were asked to wait upstairs in a lounge type area where nobody took our drink order or checked on us.  We finally walked out the door at 8:30 and were never seated.  I strongly recommend never going here."}
{"text":"Blue Agave is a great spot! The first time I came here was for a Yelp Community Event, which was on a weekday, so it wasn't as busy. They do happy hour deals, so I think I got a margarita for $5 or maybe even less than that. Either way, the margarita was great!  The second time I came here was on Cinco de Mayo. The wait was an hour, but that was fine. We got a pitcher of frozen margarita. Except, it didn't come in a pitcher. It came in this giant clay vase. It wasn't very functional for pouring drinks into salted glasses, which is what some of us wanted.  I've gotten tacos both times here. The tacos are so good! There's this super spicy salsa that comes with it. It's too spicy for me, but it was pretty yummy.  I will say, the host was not a very good host. She was so confused and clueless. I've seen her multiple times now. There would have been a third visit here, but I had asked for take-out and she didn't direct me to the right place. She doesn't make eye contact and is very bad with recognizing faces. I asked her if we could grab a drink from the bar while we waited, she said sure. Then we went back to wait outside, and she told us to have a nice evening, but then was like, \"Oh wait, you're waiting.\" I mean, multiple times we had encounters where she'd forget the question I asked."}
{"text":"Neighborhood favorite! Food is excellent and service is even better. Nachos are a favorite along with anything that includes Tinga (spicy chicken). Shame to see the Bayou painting over painted but they have done a nice job inside. Highly recommemd you check it out and support local business owners."}
