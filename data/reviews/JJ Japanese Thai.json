{"text":"Wtf is this place. Servers acted dead, menu items weren't there, and a centipede was found in my Water. Lost our apetite. We were thinking Of leaving but decided to stay. Food was alright, the short rib was probably the only ítem that was decent. Service was terrible, no greeting, server  used a monotone  voice throughout service, violently placed our food on the our table, and almost running away after giving us our food. On top of other factors, me and my family had a poor experience at JJs. This was on father's day as well."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I meet at this venue annually for a Christmas celebration.  All you can eat! Our waitresses so far were always pleasant and prompt to our needs.  This year, come December, will be our 4th get together! Its not close to home but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Decor is nice. But service is lacking for a higher end asian restaurant. servers were rude. Rushed you when ordering. Will not be going back. Spoon and fork chain has not changed one bit. Needs to improve their customer experience by hiring friendlier people. Or maybe it was just the older lady server we got. Very moody."}
{"text":"Very first thought was that the place was very nicely decorated and that the atmosphere of the location was neat and relatively upscale.  However, for anyoone interested in trying this out, understand that this is technically or I guess is really spoon and fork.  LOL.  Should have really checked the place out, but my friend and I were just going on the word of our other friends and did not realize this buffet was pretty much the same Spoon and Fork with just a different name plastered on it.  

Dishes are relatively the same with a bit of variety here and there and overall food was good.  Service was pretty decent too and hence, while I am upset that I got faked that it would be another very unique experience, it was pretty much the same thai and japanese fusion that I have been to before.  

Overall, Spoon and Fork locations are relatively good and if you are craving for a bit of both or a bit of variety, the Spoon and Fork locations (AKA JJ Japanese Thai) is also a great place to try.  Will I come again, probably not as there are many places that are relatively more affordable as well as to me a bit better suited for my taste, but if you want a quick bite with many choices the place to be is here."}
{"text":"Interesting place!  Sushi and Thai in one place, but it's not fusion.  The sushi good, rice was fluffy and fresh as were the veggies.  The red curry was way too spicy, I like spice but it was too spicy.  The waitress wasn't very receptive to the feedback or helpful, just showed us the menu where it says the curry is spicy.  My friend has been here several times and stated it's usually not this spicy.  But she pretty much ignored that."}
{"text":"I go to a ton of Japanese restaurants and this place was \"ugh\" at best. 

Service was the worst service ever. I have never felt so rushed at a restaurant before like this one. 

Waitress kept on asking us are we done our food when there was clearly good left on our plates. It was so obvious they were trying to churn tables as quickly as possible. 

Good was okay I've definitely had better 

No host greeting you when you come in or when you leave. Worst service no joke!"}
{"text":"** I would not give any stars to this restaurant**

Went there on a Friday night - 6 adults and 3 children.  It was a special occasion as we were celebrating a birthday.  All 6 adults ordered the 'All You Can Taste' AYCT which is $28 per person.  We informed the server we had decided and asked for a regular menu as the children (ages 5-8) who only wanted to eat some noodles.
She looked confused and told us we could not do that.  The children HAD to order from the AYCT menu as well.  We informed her again that we weren't going to give them food from our plates !  We only wanted noodles as that's all they would eat. 
She called her manager and he was extremely rude.  He said it could only be done if we separated the tables and the 3 children sat by themselves !  
He was arrogant, rude and has no manners at all.  
We decided to leave immediately and told him we would never return.  

A total disappointment and no where on their website does it state that everyone on the table has to order from the AYCT menu!  
We went to Spring Rolls at Erin Mills Town Centre.  The service there was excellent and the food was good and portions were generous as well."}
{"text":"JJ's has quickly become our favourite spot to wind down from a hard day/week, to celebrate special occasions, and generally just to treat ourselves.

The menu, which has been recently updated, is fabulous, with a wide variety - everyone, even Mr. Steak and Potatoes, can find something to please their palates.  Over the past couple of months, we've sampled a large number of their dishes, and can wholeheartedly recommend the roast duck in tamarind raspberry sauce, the Spicy Basil, and the Thick Curry Peanut Sauce.  Also the curry pumpkin soup was amazing with a good level of spice.

Their signature martinis are a must try!

Fantastic food, wonderful atmosphere and an option for take out? Can't miss."}
{"text":"I've ordered take-out sushi from this place a few times and was always impressed (especially with their sushi salmon pizza which is AMAZING). However, recently, my family and I went for my birthday dinner. It was my first time inside the dining area and it was really nice! We got to choose where to sit and ended up picking a private area with a huge table and benches with pillows :) 

They had an all-you-can eat special (for $27.99 pp) going on which we were not aware of, and after some debating (if one person chose AYCE, everyone else had to), we decided to go for it. The AYCE menu was huge and it contained almost everything that was on the regular menu but in smaller portions (besides the sushi rolls which came in 6-8 pieces). Appetizers, soups, salads, sushi, sashimi, maki rolls, hand rolls, thai dishes, curry dishes, grilled dishes and rice & noodle dishes were all on the menu and there was quite a large selection. I guess because this restaurant is not normally AYCE, the quality of the food was amazing and although the waitor told us the portions are alot smaller (for the hot dishes), they were not as small as we thought and had an extremely hard time finishing everything. 

The food came out really fast and the service was good. Our waitor did not show much expression throughout our meal but at the very end when we got our bill, he brought me out a complimentary birthday plate with mini fried-bananas and ice cream with a candle...and noone in my family had told him it was my birthday! We asked him how he knew and he told us that he overheard me telling my sister that I just got a birthday text from someone and he also saw us clinking glasses and picked up that it was my birthday! I thought that was very sweet and thoughtful :)

The 5 of us ordered way too many things to remember but here are some of the items: scallop rockafeller (in an actual sea-shell!), sushi pizza (mini ones!), sushi & sashimi (assorted fish-fresh and delicious as always), thai lemongrass soup, hawaii roll (so-so), golden dragon (delicious), spicy salmon rol (was too full to even try one piece but my dad really enjoyed it), thick curry tiger shrimp (SO good), beef with pad thai (average), grilled salmon (my parents each ordered one and I was shocked at how big the salmon portion was!! And they said it was delicious), & calamari (tried a couple pieces and it was tasty).

All in all, great service, amazing food, and lovely ambience. My only regret was ordering way too much food (I don't think I have ever eaten that much in my life) and feeling extremely uncomfortable afterward. Everyone was starving when we got there and there was so much selection that we wanted to try as many things as we could, which is a great danger with AYCE. Although their AYCE special is quite pricey ($28) compared to other AYCEs, it is worth it, as the quality and selection of the food is much better than it is anywhere else. Same goes for the service and the whole dining experience. 

Try to get to JJs as soon as you can before they stop their AYCE special! :)"}
{"text":"Celebrated a friend's birthday at JJ Thai.  We had a great spot near the fireplace.  It is really nice inside.  Our server made sure to introduce herself and ask about drinks.  Drinks - exactly what we needed after getting a bit lost!  A really good sushi selection and it is fresh.  Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon- yum.  Then it was the main - pineapple fried rice and spicy peanut sauce chicken.  I recommend this spicy and sweet combination.  It's a really tasty mix. Unfortunately, we were too full to stay for dessert.   The overall experience was very pleasant.  

My only caution for anyone driving is give yourself some extra time to find parking.  It can get a little busy."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Paul.  The food was good.  Hubby, my mom and I shared pineapple fried rice, Pad Thai, Basil Beef and Spicy Tuna rolls.  However, we waited over 45 minutes for our RESERVED table.  The manager attempted to apologize for the wait with free appetizers, but unfortunately the waiter we had was not in the greatest mood.  When we got to the table we were only given 3 menus for a group of 8, and when I asked for extra menus the waiter got annoyed.  Even when we tried to ask his opinion on what option was less spicy the waiter did not acknowledge the question. Overall, nice atmosphere, good food, but it was the service that may not have us coming back for more."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. Went here for the all-you-can-eat dim sum. Was fantastic.

The place is very nice inside and the food is very good.

I would recommend the dinner special for everything on the menu. Will always come here."}
{"text":"Wicked sushi and tastes very fresh. Fast service too! Dynamite roll is pretty good"}
{"text":"The food was okay. Not really special. The only thing I like about this place is the atmosphere. One thing that is really really bad is the customer service. The server named Ashley was very rude. She didn't ask about how was my food, and after we pay the bill, she didn't even say \"thank you\". All 3 of us were really not impressed with this."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here!!! I always go for all you can eat despite it being on the pricy side. The sushi is fresh and always delicious. Seriously I have nothing bad to say about the food!

My only complaint would be the service, it always feels like we have to signal in order to order more food or drinks but then the waitress actually hovers to see how much we tip."}
{"text":"I came here with my mum once for dinner (a la carte) and another time for the lunch buffet. We were very happy on both occasions. This place is perhaps a bit on the expensive side when it comes to a la carte but I give it 5 stars because it is very worth it for the buffet. So just come here for the buffet! 

As someone who loves both Japanese and Thai food, this place was just perfect for me. First, we started with some Japanese sushi and sashimi. They have a good selection of sushi and sashimi. Had to ask the waiter what was in each sushi roll and he was very knowledgeable and could tell us exactly what was inside. 

We then ordered some Thai dishes like green curry, pineapple fried rice, stir fry eggplant. It was all delicious. The dishes are a bit on the small side BUT for a buffet this is what you want because it allows you to sample different types of food. However, for a la carte, I can understand the gripes about small portions. A huge plus point about this place is they make the food as you order. It is not displayed in the open buffet-style. I believe the food is fresher this way. 

The buffet was about $20++ per person if I remember correctly. Service was excellent. I would definitely come back here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, but the service loses points.

They have some interesting combinations and recipes that work surprisingly well.  I asked for extra spicy on my Pad Thai but it wasn't unmanageable and the portion was decent sized.  The ambiance is a darker, moody feel, with some very interesting decorative elements.  

Everytime we go, we order the fried ice cream.  It is delicious, comes with two contrasting sauces, and really helps put a nice end note to dinner.

The sore points arise when it comes to the service.  The couple times I went, it felt like the staff were more interested in talking with each other, than to attend to our needs.  The food took a good 40 minutes to prepare, and then the bill took an almost equal amount of time to be rung through.  This was after they brought us the bill unprompted (hinting at us to leave, perhaps)."}
{"text":"I love the red Thai curry!!!! The service is good and it's never a long wait for takeout. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We went for a la carte dinner and tried the Thai dishes. This place is very nice from inside.  Easily a great place to go to for a date :)  the ambiance is excellent!  

Service was ok nothing exceptional.  But no complaints.  We tried a few of the items from the a la carte menu.  Tilapia in basil sauce ( great but sauce was lacking)  I had asked for it to be more saucy not dry but was told there will be $2 extra for additional sauce.  Really?  The green curry was not bad,  but was lacking a lil bit of flavor.  Peanut curry shrimp and Bangkok pad Thai was fantastic! 

I have also tried their all you can eat dinner menu which was quite good as well.  The sushi us not exceptional but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I had the chicken pad Thai which I thought was okay. I've definitely had better. This restaurant has no sustainability standards - when it comes to the seafood they serve -so until they implement not serving near threatened fish populations, I won't be returning, let alone eating their seafood."}
{"text":"Food is ok service is very slow you don't see your server around much they need more people and more friendly server I will give it one more try"}
{"text":"I randomly found this restaurant by accident and ended up really liking it! My first impression when I walked in was, very classy/elegant atmosphere. I ordered the Calamari for $8.00, Fried Wontons (12 pieces made with chicken) $8.00, Garlic Beef $13.00, and Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Mushroom (Pad Kana) $10.00. Overall the food was very good but the prices we're too high and portions were kind of small. I went to this restaurant with 3 other people and we're still hungry after we finished eating :( The servers were very polite and respectful, even gave us a discount! I have posted pictures of the food we ordered. I gave this restaurant 4 stars because of the food, which is what really matters at the end of the day. I will return to try this restaurant but not on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"I would give this about a 4.5. There seems to be a lot of contradiction in service experience so I guess it's best if you go when they aren't busy, because service certainly didn't fail me. They were courteous and got their job done. Perhaps not the most expressive servers one could wish for (didn't smile much) but they were attentive, and listened.

This place is a modern themed Japanese/Thai restaurant featuring order or AYCE. Can't really speak for the dining menu, but we had a brief look and they featured roughly the same things at a much less affordable rate than AYCE. AYCE is 28 per adult, pretty expensive but worth it because the food is above average of a sushi buffet. Comparatively, just  a single serving of seaweed salad is already $5 alone.

Their kitchen menu will not fail you, not all of their stuff is great, but most of it is, and it is done and prepared in a classy fashion (they don't just slap your food on a plate). Was thoroughly satisfied with their  food, but drinks come extra, and no dessert in AYCE is the only downside. However, what is probably most amazing was that they gave us EVERY SINGLE ITEM that we ordered. Never experienced that from a buffet, and they didn't grumble at us (even though we stayed over 2 hr).

Definitely a worthwhile place to visit, just don't go when it's busy!"}
{"text":"We've only had the takeout so far but the jazzy background music has me wanting to dine in soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love their food, their sushi and sashimi is the best in town. I love their servers, who always remember us and ask about the kids, work, etc. But I looooove their Pad Thai.  They have generous portions and it's always made fresh and with just the right amount of sauce and meat. Go there now!  

Make sure you have a reservation, especially for weekend bookings, because they are very busy."}
{"text":"***3.5 Stars***

JJs is a hop, skip and short jaunt from my office.  A few coworkers and I decided to check out for lunch last week.  We made a reservation which is a must for the lunch time crowd.  By 12:30pm, the place was packed and bustling!

They have a lunch menu which has a little bit of everything from sushi to thai ranging from $10-15.  I ordered maki set B and it was fresh and delicious!

Unfortunately, the service was lack-lustre.  Our server forgot about us a couple of times.  One would think that a busy lunch spot would have better than normal service; sadly no.

I may come back on a less busy lunch day to try out their Thai options on their menu.

PS. The interior decor was awesome; very romantic and chic.  I would hit this place up for a date night!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, wished it was bigger portions"}
{"text":"Good sushi (but not the best ever), really nice trendy\classy ambience, ok service. I would rate it a 3,5 if possible."}
{"text":"This is a great concept. In addition to a wide assortment of Thai and Japanese food, for a fixed price you can get an all-you-can-eat option that allows you to order anything off the menu -- in smaller portions -- as much as you want. A great way to try new things. 
All of my dishes were very good. We had some service issues, but I don't think it was our waitresses fault."}
{"text":"I go to Spoon and Fork all the time so I thought I would try out JJ on their weekend all you can taste menu. As I expected the food was good and there were new options to try as well. However I was disappointed in the service we received.  All staff seemed cold, rude, and apathetic. On top of being extremely slow i was surprised at how lacking the service is compared to its sister restaurants."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of sushi buffets and this one was ok. Food was great but overall I'd rather go somewhere else..

I'm used to using the iPads at sushi buffets, this one uses an actual menu and a waitress comes to write down your order. There was nothing wrong with this, just different from what I'm used to! She had quite a few tables but was still very good at service! She was friendly, knew the menu well and always made sure our glasses were full of water!

Inside was very fancy!! I felt totally underdressed! It felt a little too fancy!

It was $30 per person.....ummm that's a lot...I would usually pay that much with tax and tip included at other sushi buffets...I wouldn't go back cuz of that price when I know I can get the same quality somewhere else for cheaper."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in Mississauga so far. The menu is pretty good. Good environment for dining or hanging out. You can choose either all you can eat or regular menu. Beef rib is very delicious. Sashimi is fresh. Highly recommend Salmon tataki."}
{"text":"No longer serves \"All you can taste\".  
Only available on Saturday and Sundays lunch time."}
{"text":"One of the greatest finds in Mississauga. Super affordable, great food..... Did I mention that the restaurant is incredibly classy? Really surprised at the pricing giving the ambience. 

Ordered chicken basil fried rice, while my friend had pad Thai. Both were really yummy! Can't wait to go back and try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Went there for all you can eat lunch on a saturday. Server was not very nice. I wanted just tempura shrimp without other kinds of tempura and the waitress said no. Food comes out really greasy. The only kitchen item I enjoyed was the coconut shrimp. Salmon sushi was excellent- this is the only reason I would ever consider going back. Sushi rolls were terrible. Didnt eat them. At the end the waitness gave us a desert and coffee menu  which was so sticky, dirty and stained. It looked like something fished out of a dumpster. I could not believe they would give this to someone at a resturant. See picture. This is a place I would tolerate if a friend wanted to go, but not somewhere I would willingly go."}
{"text":"Need your AYCE, classy? Well, JJ's is as close as you can get to that concept (in Mississauga anyways)!

Décor is fab. Service is good. Portions are just right (small so you can try everything). Price is cheap considering the atmosphere ($29.99 for weekend dinner). Decent wine list.

Now the food is comparable to Heart Sushi, but a touch more creative/higher quality.

Try: Smoked duck salad, shiitake mushrooms stuffed with shrimp, basil chicken lettuce wrap, butter chicken, fried rice

Pass: pumpkin soup, tacos

Will definitely be back next time I'm in a gluttonous mood!"}
{"text":"This is the same guys who bring the Spoon & Fork restaurants. It is just that it's not all you can taste so it could get pricey if you are hungry. The devour is beautiful and classy. A great place for a date or to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"I formerly quite liked this place, back when it was AYCE, as the food quality and the decor was A LITTLE better than your run-of-the-mill ayce sushi joint. 
HOWEVER, they no longer do AYCE, so now the small portions, and the quality, are both sub-par compared to other sushi places in the same price category.  PLUS, it's just a chain, so it's certainly not worth the extra money. 
LESSON: Being a big fish in the AYCE pond, was absolutely a better choice than being a small fish swimming with the bigger sharks in the upscale sushi waters.
\"Sorry Charlie!\""}
{"text":"JJ Japanese is alright. The ambience of the place is nice but I've been to smaller places with better sushi.  I came during lunch time and I felt rushed since they have specific hours of operation. I have gone twice and last Saturday it was closed. I have nothing really special to say about the food so I will leave it there :)"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance, the food was acceptable but the worst service I've ever had. I don't need to be treated like royalty but the staff here are incredibly rude, resentful when asked to do anything and seem offended by the existance of customers.

Even if they had the best sushi in town (which they don't), even if they had the best prices in town (which they don't), I still wouldn't go back. 

Why would anyone want to pay money to be treated like garbage?"}
{"text":"The food is truly what brings me back to this place. We go there for lunch with coworkers and we sometimes go for dinner, but I prefer to take out the order. 

The staff is friendly, and the portions are very good!  I love their new tastings menu, lots of chances to try new things on the menu in smaller sharing portions. 

Their sushi is really fantastic. I love the spicy tuna rolls, they are fresh and delicious. Also, their fried oysters are delicious as an app.

Don't expect first class service, this place is busy and things move quickly. The decor, however, IS first class. One of the most beautiful restaurants I've been in. 

Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Friday night AYCE,  Simon the waiter very friendly. Nice atmosphere, good selection of food options. Definitely would go back here for a date night."}
{"text":"First time back to this restaurant in a long time. I have to say the food quality is still enjoyable. The cooked food is definitely better than before, however, the sushi side is lacking. It doesn't seem like anything is fresh. Even the wasabi has turned black/blown. Service is so-so, our waitress didn't come around a lot to ask how everything was going and we always had a pile up of empty dishes at our table. The very negative side, there are lot of flies and mosquitoes flying around the restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually come during the weekend for the all-you-can-eat, and it never disappoints me. They have a wide variety of Japanese and Thai dishes you can try.  The sashimi is always fresh and nicely served.  My favourite dishes are the sashimi, volcano roll, Thai basil fish and crab fried rice.  

They also have a very competitively priced catering menu.  I usually get the T14, which is a Sushi, Sashimi and Maki combo for $29.99 with 62 pieces."}
{"text":"What a lovely place! All you can eat or à la carte but must be everyone at the table. If you have been to spoon n fork and like their menu, this is the place. 

The server for our table was really polite. He knew how to take orders. The kitchen orders arrived pretty fast but the sushi bar orders took a while. For all you can eat, all dishes were small portion but good enough for tasting the flavor. Sushi size is decent... maybe a bit of too much rice in some but overall we all likes the sushi, sashimi and rolls at this place. 

I didn't like the udon soup. It has no flavor. The hot and sour soup wasn't my favorite as it just taste like black pepper soup and chili sauce. Lobster taco was alright, barely see any lobster. I liked calamari taco better as it has mango sauce.. weird but good. 

I will definitely go back again for special occasion only (50% off +/- 7 days within your birthday. The price is more expensive than other sushi all you can eat restaurants. This place still has server to take orders instead of iPad or tablet orders. Also if you have a group of 8 ppl or more, expect a 15% tips already added to your bill."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.. enjoyed all what you can eat menu. Very fresh and high quality food. Service was very amazing. What I do like most compare to others is the portion per order is really enough. So, you can try most of their very variable options .. sure I would cone again."}
{"text":"Very creative use of ingredients - the sauce with whole grilled squid was wonderful .
New items on the menu show a staff willing to try creative blends and combinations. 
The fried soft shell crab taco was delicious. All of the hot plates looked good on the menu. 
The sashimi and Maki rolls were tender and well presented. 
I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing good but their decor, not worth the money. This restaurant is out of place and mind, with wierd menu items (tacos? Smoked duck? How is this Japanese or Thai??)

Food: for 46 dollar per person we got, 

-beef teriyaki that taste dreadful of an unwashed grill, bitter, and just nasty.
-curry shrimp was an average sauce (only 3 shrimp)
-udon soup with the broth wayyy too sweet 
-maki rolls that were carelessly made and falling apart with bits of rice stuck to the outside and around the plate (insult to Japanese cuisine)
-NO DESSERT because it's not included 
-good miso soup
-beef tataki which was sweet and sour, which is prepared wrong.
-NO DRINKS cause that's extra (wow)


SERVICE: Servers were slowed because it they weren't organized. We get our apps at the end of the meal etc. 

ATMOSPHERE: Its a fine dining atmosphere, which makes sense because it used to be a chophouse. Everything felt out of place, the bowls and plates are European style not Asian, no tea was served just water. 

CONCLUSION: I suggest the owners to study more about Asian cuisine and culture before opening up a restaurant."}
{"text":"Love JJ's!! Especially the all-you-can-eat.
Clean, inviting atmosphere. food is delicious and delivered in a nice way, and also so much variety!! 
You must try the escargot & calamari taco as appetizers. Only one star off because the service is only mediocre & for the price you pay for ayce, you would expect free Icecream or a small dessert :("}
{"text":"JJ's has improved gradually over the past 4 years. I've been here a few times for lunch and dinner. The quality of food and service has gotten better. I really like the red thai curry (chicken), and the ginger honey tea. Usually about $16 for lunch. Not the cheapest lunch in the area, but for a nice sit-in restaurant with good service, it's great. 

The sushi and appetizers are also very good, and beautifully presented. The spice level isn't crazy, and I personally find them tolerable and tame compared to other Thai restaurants. 

The ambiance is great, the crystal chandeliers are beautiful, and the dining area is very clean and sophisticated."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but the service was awful. Came for the AYCE weekend. There definitely needs to be a change in the system when ordering during AYCE as you need to recite your entire order to the server. 

Our server actually stopped us as we were in the middle of ordering and told us she'll come back? What? She never came back and was rude pretty much the entire night. There's just something really off putting about ordering buffet items from a server. Which really is a downer as the food is really really good."}
{"text":"I have tried both their AYCE and regular menu. I find when restaurants mix Asian cuisines, they do neither well.

Thai food - not good, pad Thai is bland ketchup noodles, spicy noodles is too spicy (heart burn), papaya salad just taste like fish sauce, basil eggplant is flat

Japanese food - sushi and rolls are mediocre, not fresh, rest of dishes are just bland

Service - good but slow

Price - higher end but nice setting for business lunches"}
{"text":"Good selection and variety. Food tasted good - although some items needed improvements. Did not like the 2-hour dining restrictions for the AYCE option."}
{"text":"I have been out here on several business trips and I am definitely a repeat customer at JJs.  The all-you-can eat menu is the way to go.  The sushi is excellent and the Thai Dumplings are amazing. The service was amazing my first time, but has been has been only so-so the last few times.  I recommend this place to anyone craving sushi in Mississauga"}
{"text":"Super dark. Service sucks. Food is okay, huge portions so it was hard to do the all you can taste option.  Really bad service.  In my case sat for fifteen minutes with no food while the other diner with me had a soup and salad, order was forgotten, table was not cleared even when I already stacked the plates for them.  Even worse service than a busy Chinese fast food place."}
{"text":"Disappointed this time.  The spring rolls were swimming in grease and the pad Thai was bland and dry. We've been here before and really enjoyed it so maybe it was an \"off day\" or a new chef in the kitchen.  The service was fantastic and the atmosphere is lovely.  Will give it one more try"}
{"text":"this restaurant has the smallest portion for the price they charge! very slow service. don't recommend this restaurant!! oww by the way we ordered ala carte."}
{"text":"Went here with the family recently because Sushi Suhi closed and it's close by.

Sashimi quality was really good. 

The decor was pretty and gave it a different feel from other AYCE. 

The menu was extensive and lots of choose from. We basically ordered their whole appetizer menu and more was good. The tacos were a bit of a filler item with not much to say. The crispy beef stood out for me. 

I wish desserts were included with the price, at least some ice cream. My nephew got free ice-cream because the server spilled something on his chair. 

Probably wouldn't go back and would rather Spoonful for that price and having to order on paper."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. However, over the course of time the proportions have gotten significantly smaller and the cost has increased."}
{"text":"We came here for the a la carte option and it's not something I can recommend due to the pricing. If you're coming here, the all you can eat would be a much better bet. It's great to have both Thai and Japanese food in one place and the food here is quite decent.  

The sushi rolls were good but they were indeed of AYCE quality (not saying that is a bad thing) but considering the price you're paying for 4 Maki rolls per order, I would have expected A. For it to better or B. To offer 8 or even 6 rolls for the price. Also, offering 4 rolls was a little odd as you typically get 6/8 per order. That being said the construction was fresh and more than passable.

The curry pad Thai was also quite ordinary in a decent way. The flavors of the curry powder and sweetness were good but again, the portions were somewhat lacking here. 

What stood out was the service and the ambience of this place which is very unusual of AYCE places. There's a classier feel with the wine glasses, the dining cloth napkins, the plates, and just the overall decor of the place. It's clean and modern. The service was also very professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Have visited JJ's a couple of times now with co-workers as this place is super close to our office. Each visit has been just a-ok.

Once was for a holiday lunch which sadly I was just recovering from a nasty bout of food poisoning so I only tried the miso soup and plain steamed rice - both were fine.

Visited last week for a co-workers' going away party. I opted for the Bangkok Pad Thai with tofu and veggies with a miso soup to start. Miso soup was standard, no complaints there. My main arrived hot however it was super heavy as they used a ton of oil so I couldn't finish it. They also seemed to not take much care in chopping the veggies as there were massive (read too big to eat in one bite) chunks of onion throughout. I also could only find two tiny bits of tofu. Oh well!

Would visit again but will try something off of the Japanese portion of the menu instead."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there tonight, the food was great. The Sushi menu has a lot of different choices but its mostly ala carte - there were three set menus - which weren't appealing to me so I ordered from the ala carte menu. Most of the items on the ala carte menu came in four pieces so had to order to 5 ( a little more than I am used to paying for a similar sushi meal). Over all everyone was satisfied with the dinner  (four of us had non-sushi dinners) - $200 for six w/ one bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Up until Friday night I hadn't been here in over a year, and I don't know if it's just me or the food has really gone downhill. The restaurant has beautiful decor and the staff is nice (although our waitress had to ask the manager about every substitution we requested). 
Here are all the things we ordered: brie, spicy avocado cucumber wrap, yam roll, mango salad and my boyfriend got the crispy beef. Honestly the only item I would say we actually enjoyed was the yam rolls. They were fresh and has crispy tempura inside and we got spicy mayo on the side (so really we modified them to make them above average). Everything else was extremely 'meh'. It didn't taste bad, but didn't taste great, very bland. I used to quite like their food here which is why I was excited to come back but now I really don't see a reason to return. Even my mango juice was kind of gross, like the cheap brand not the good thick puree. 
Oh well, if you end up here anyways stick with the sushi."}
{"text":"That best Thai/sushi. I've dined as well as takeout. When dining, the staff are very friendly informative and personable. Really nice atmosphere. Maybe a bit pricey for some. But worth it because the sushi is amazing. My favourite dishes are the streetstyle bangkok padthai and the rainbow roll. Definitely my favorite place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped at JJ Japanese Thai after walking for over an hour.
We hadn't exactly planned on stopping here, just wherever the wind took us.
It was fancier than I expected! I'm so glad I wasn't wearing crocs LMAO.
They had very nice decor, white tablecloths, and beautiful statues/sculptures. I liked the look of the place.
Our server was just darling. So friendly and knowledgeable. We really liked her.
I ordered the Maki Dinner (27 pieces) for $20.
It came with three tuna and salmon rolls, 8 spicy salmon and California rolls, and 5 futo maki. 
I'm not sure exactly what futo maki is but I didn't like it.
The rest of them were excellent.
It was a lot of food.
 
They have all you can eat for $29. I don't think I could handle that but my boyfriend was interested in trying it maybe some time in the future.
 
Tea was $3. They give you a cute little tea pot per person. It was good but a bit expensive.
 
I noticed that our server was wearing a \"Prince\" apron and I asked her if she worked at Prince Sushi as well (our FAVOURITE GTA sushi spot). She told us that she did not but the owners of JJ were the owners of Prince and a bunch of different restaurants around the GTA.
 
No wonder we liked the food.
 
Tip: They are not open for lunch. They open at 4:30 pm.
 
I liked the sushi and the service, it's a bit more expensive than Prince which is still our favourite, but JJ Japanese and Thai is definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Best calamari & Thai garlic shrimp. Highly recommend this place. 
Nice ambiance.   Ok service though, hence the lack of 1 star to complete the 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I like this place. I like the AYCE concept. It can be home after when you are with a large group, food is pretty much everywhere. The decor is great and the food is yummy. I like that you can have Thai food and Japanese food. No complaints."}
{"text":"I'm an avid Thai and Japanese all you can eat restaurant enthusiast. JJ's popped up into my radar recently and it gave the impression of a more upscale version of Spoon and Fork, since it is under them as well. I decided to take my mother here for Mother's Day. I must say that this has been my worst  all you can eat experience so far. Every beef dish was dry, the winton literally had one strip of chicken in it, and the salmon was dry as well. They also somehow managed to make the sashimi dry! All the dishes we ordered gave off the impression of not actually being fresh."}
{"text":"After a long day of audit we were trying to place a good place nearby for dinner. My coworker previously visited JJ with our Japanese coworkers they were happy with the food there. The restaurant was located in a strip filled with restaurants. When we walked in, on first look it seemed like a dark loungey restaurant but it was a contemporary restaurant with a \"posh\" look. 

We were seated immediately in front of us were these hardcover menu with delightful photos of the food served at JJ. However there was no price. We were like hmmm....maybe this was a very expensive restaurant. My coworker explained that last time he was given a menu with price. We looked around and true enough there was another menu that was wordy and had no photos in it. At that moment, the server came over and explained that we could go with the regular menu or the buffet. The menu with photos was a buffet menu, oh how nice I thought. The best part, it was $27 ++ a person. 

The menu included standard Japanese and other asian appetizers I had  age dashi tofu, seaweeed salad, smoked duck salad and miso soup. They were very delicious and high quality you could tell especially even the miso had authentic flavor. Then came the sashimi, sushi and other rolls. 

Camillia Sashimi Tako; Tai; Hokkigai; Salmon; Butter Fish; White Tuna; Katsuo:
They were of superb quality and well-cut. 

Aburi Sushi Ika; Salmon; Katsuo; Unagi; Saba:
Then I opted for the slightly charred nigiris of more or less similar cuts of fish. It came with a thicken teriyaki sauce. I cannot describe to you how the slightly char brought such a great flavor to the nigiris

I also had the white tuna tataki that was good but didn't have a \"wow\" factor.

I end the buffet with the Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai:
It had a much stronger and spicier flavor. Very surprised by it and loved it!!

Honestly I was not having high hopes when I realized I was going to an Asian restaurant in the greater Toronto area. Especially it was Japanese slash Thai - that's usualy a bad sign in DC. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the higher standard of Asian food much higher than DC for the price paid. The quality of buffet food surpassed the so-called \"Japanese\" restaurants in DC. Yep it's true. What a good find in Toronto. If you are in the area, I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Great food! I suggest the Thai coconut shrimp soup. Sushi is great but their Thai is even better. Menu is fantastic and the restaurant is beautiful, very relaxing atmosphere.

One of my favorites in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of buffets. I value good food that's well prepared but most buffets just don't have this as their priority. I wouldn't dare to say JJ has this mission but the food is above your average buffet.

The menu is a good selection of mostly Thai dishes with a bit of Japanese fare like sushi and common fresh fishes like salmon. The Japanese menu won't wow you and neither will the quality of the fish but it's pretty good for buffet standards.

The Thai dishes are mostly hit and a bit of miss. The curries are decent along with the pad thai but their skewers are a bit on the dry side. Beef dishes are actually quite decent here too.

All in all, a good place for buffet but you won't need to hold on to your socks, they won't blow off."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic for an all you can eat Japanese dinner!!! They have the quality of a great a la carte Japanese restaurant on an all you can eat option! Ambiance and service is also good."}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  It looks and feels better than a Keg or a Moxies.  The decor is so perfect. Ordered off the menu.  Excellent quality, value and variety.  Had the tuna tartare, off the hook delicious.  The fresh ground wasabi was bright and so different from typical paste stuff.  Also had the green Thai curry ... Delicious!!

The service was perfect too.  Quick, but not rushed.  This is a must visit restaurant.  And I'll be back too."}
{"text":"Went for dinner AYCE... really pricey for what you get.  A lot of the stuff on the menu not included also like the tuna and soft drinks.  The skewers were quite tasty but all the sushi was par and some sub par.  Def. a lot better stuff in Mississauga and much better stuff in TO or the east end.  I'd pass on this place.  Ambiance and service is nice and classy but that's one of the few positives.  The food again is par but the price drives it down to 2 :("}
{"text":"Really nice experience. Service was fast and polite and sushi was great!  Very good value too; would totally go back."}
{"text":"Love their sushi. We order large for our studio lunches and they've never messed up an order. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"As recent transplants to Mississauga we're happy that we finally found a great Thai restaurant in the area. We ordered take out last night and each dish was great. They did mess up one of our order items and gave us the assorted fish pizza instead of the candy cane beet salad. But we were happy with the unexpected item so no harm done. 

We're looking forward to eating in the restaurant next time and trying some of the other menu options. Note: the take out menu is different from the regular dinner menu."}
{"text":"Naught is more delicious than visiting a fine dining restaurant, eating the freshest ingredients combined in an innovative dish cooked by top-chefs. Alas, JJ succeeds on the former, but fails to deliver on innovation. JJ is a restaurant situated yonder in a community filled with high-level business offices, surrounded by business executives in their natty suits. JJ serves more than your typical Japanese Thai. I ate a Asian style taco, believe it or not. Is it fusion style at its finest? Read along, for I shall bestow you with my recommendation.

Me and my friends, after a strenuous day, resolved to eat out at a fancy restaurants, in lieu of cooking a home-cooked meal. As we step through the threshold and into the restaurant, a male host greeted us. We had booked a reservation. A bloke led us to our table, and beckoned us to make ourselves feel comfortable. The first thing that struck me was the beautiful decor, that illuminated that entire dining room with elegance and a fine-dining atmosphere.

A waiter, a nice young fella, approached our table, received us with a friendly greeting, and quickly introduced us to the restaurant and ordering style. He left us to peruse the menu and left to grab our drinks. After minutes of picking and weighing our options, I decided to order Shrimp Pad Thai, Spicy Eggplant, and a few maki rolls, My other friends ordered a spicy soup, some salad, curry fried noodles, and some other dishes.

The streets came out moderately warm, straight from the kitchen. The first dish that came to our table was the sashimi. The fish was not exactly the freshest, but still provided a decent taste. The maki rolls were not nicely wrapped, as each piece fell apart when I picked up a piece with my chopsticks. The rice, in my honest opinion, were not sticky enough and could not hold together in the form of a sushi (Does that make sense?).

The shrimp pad thai brought new flavours into my mouth. The dish was freshly cooked, straight to the waiter's hands and onto our table. The shrimps were a nice compliment to the overall dishes. The dish was not exactly the most authentic Pad Thai, but overall, it was still good.

The Thai Spicy Eggplant was probably the best dish. The instant I placed a piece of eggplant in my mouth, geysers of flavors bursted into my mouth. However, the spiciness was a bit overwhelming. My mouth caught on fire and almost combusted. Not literally. Only figuratively. But almost to the point of literally. Does that count? Anyways, the dish was a welcoming joy to my dinner, even when the pains numbed my mouth.  

For much of the bravado decor and a fine dining atmosphere, nothing during my dinner blew me away, or achieved any innovation in any book. Some of the dishes were only average, and for the total price, everything, except the eggplant, was underwhelming. A blight to the overall score.

Alas, JJ was a great disappointment, with very few high points. The Pad Thai and Eggplant were amazing dishes, despite the eggplant being too spicy. However, nothing on the menu spelled excitement or innovation, sticking towards the same ingredients and dishes we've all seen and ate at other AYCE restaurants. The price was also relatively expensive. If you are seeking a new take on Asian Cuisine, JJ is not your answer. But for a decent meal, sally forth here. Extra points for service"}
{"text":"I am very, very disappointed in JJ's. 

We had a party of 20 here today, to celebrate two birthdays.

My boyfriend and I brought in two cakes. We were told it's a dollar per head. We asked since when was the policy has been in affect, since this is not the first time we had brought cakes to celebrate birthdays. We were told by an older gentleman that it has been in place for a couple years now. NOW I know that is A LIE, since all the other birthdays have been recent. And then older gentleman tried to cover his lie BY changing his policy has been affect for a year and half, another lie. Basically the man is making up just any excuse to grab some extra money. Because he has never mentioned it to us many events before.

And now let's get to the service, we waited at the foyer for a good half hour before greeted. Another 15-20 minutes to be seated, even though we have had this reservation a week in advance.

The food was lacking, they kept forgetting half the stuff we ordered. The food was flavourless.

AND THE FINAL LET DOWN...

We gave specific instructions for the cakes, which candles goes on which, we even sharpie the boxes with the numbers. Please tell me how the cakes were brought out without the candles on and not lit up. And then they asked the Birthday boys which candles goes on which. HOW DO YOU MESS THIS UP?!

Over all very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food....love the tasting menu. No dessert included but too full for dessert anyway. Been a favourite place of ours for years.
Great decor, clean washrooms and free parking."}
{"text":"JJ Japanese Thai has been around for quite some time and admittedly, it also has some excellent prices for their takeout sushi as well.

For one of their platters I think is T14, was about 35 dollars for 60-70 pieces of sushi. I don't entirely remember but it was a good price per sushi type of deal. Quality of the fish is also decent for the price - no complaints in that area. 

I usually get the takeout rather than dining in however the dine in also has AYCE in which their octopus is generally very succulent. 

Highly recommends to try this place in Mississauga while you can."}
{"text":"My team of roughly 20 people went to JJ for a work celebration lunch and the experience was fantastic. I loved the large range of food selection that the restaurant offered and how fresh the sashimi was. 

Environment:
Upon walking in I was amazed by how beautiful the restaurant was. It was very nicely renovated, which looked upscale and classy, perfect for our work lunch with the team. Even though when we arrived it was during their lunch rush our, but since the space was large, bright and open, we didn't feel it was too noisy. We made reservation ahead and we were seated in 2 tables of 10.  

Food:
Since this was a work lunch, we ordered from the a-la cart menu. The prices were reasonable for what you're getting, actually cheaper than what I was initially expecting, given how beautifully renovated this restaurant was. 
We eat picked our own appetizer and main course, but also ordered sushi and sashimi platters to share with the whole table. I got the soft shell crab for appetizer and it blew my mind. The crab was really crispy, such that you could eat it whole even with the shell, which in my opinion, was the best part.  The flavour was good too. Then, I got the butter chicken for main and it tasted alright, but nothing too spectacular. What was the best part of the meal was when the chef suggested that they offer fresh sashimi made from fish directly imported from Japan and our boss was generous enough to order one each table. The fish tasted really good and of course really fresh, and the presentation was gorgeous that a lot of us couldn't help but to take out our phones to snap some pictures.

Service:
Service was great, the waiters were really accommodating to our big group and would frequently come over to check up how we're doing and to clear dishes. I highly recommend this restaurant for work functions or large dinner party."}
{"text":"JJ Japanese Thai offers the right amount of casual and fancy in the same spot.

I went with a good friend of mine for dinner. Neither of us are small people and we weren't sure whether to be put out or not when, upon entering the restaurant, the hostess took one look at us and said, \"Just so you know, we don't have the all-you-can-eat buffet anymore\". Uh, ok....

The calamari appetizer was fantastic, as was the fried brie. However, the shrimp tempura was only lackluster.

My friend had the Pad See Ew, which was far tastier than the Crab Fried Rice I'd ordered. 

As for drinks, I had a Cosmopolitan and she ordered the Bellini. The Cosmo was tasty, but the Bellini tasted as though the peach nectar was past its sell-by date.

Not a bad place, but I think you could do better for the price..."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere in here for a 'finer' Asian dining experience.  Prices are more expensive for Asian food than normal because of that.  However, the taste is pretty good.  I like theres sushi as well as many hot dishes.  Really good mango salad, mango chicken and green curry."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**

I really, REALLY wanted to give this restaurant a 4 star.  But...

I was Introduced and brought here by another sushi lover on a Saturday evening, so of course I had SOME sort of expectations.  But as usual, i kept an open mind for any errors.  We walked into a clean, dimly lit restaurant with ambient music playing in the background, creating a trendy atmosphere.  We were politely greeted, then brought into the bar/lounge area (possibly because the dining room seemed rather full).

We were approached by the server within reasonable time, and we ordered our drinks right away.  I have to mention they have a pretty extensive wine list that consisted of a lot of wines i liked, so I was definitely impressed!! Even more impressive was that it's one of the few restaurants that still serves wine by half litres, so even though their cocktail menu looked pretty good, this was quite an obvious choice for me.  I'd save the cocktail experience for next time.

They offer an a la carte menu, but we opted for the $27.99pp ayce menu (..duhhrr!).  Overall, the food was GOOD!!  I don't usually dine in the Mississauga, and by 'usually' I mean never.  But I can say this place set the bar quite high for all the other places I've yet to try.  There are a few dishes that I can still recall enough to give a fair review:

Curry Pumpkin Soup: 4/5 stars
A little offering of Autumn infused with Asian influence, served hot in a perfect appetizing portion! Mmmm...

Sashimi: 4.5/5 stars
Super fresh and good size pieces! I have to stress that it was ah-mazingly fresh for an ayce restaurant.  However, they were only served in 5 or 8 piece portions.

Green Curry Chicken: 3/5 stars
We really ordered beef, but it came out to be chicken.  I liked it. Nothing amazing, but good. I personally would've enjoyed a little more spice and coconut flavour.  It was a pretty big portion, just as anything else \"From the Wok\".

Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai: 4/5 stars
Very bold and tangy tastes!! It was delicious and very flavourful.  I probably would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't already full when we ordered this.

Smoked Duck Salad: 3/5 stars
Exactly like it sounds.  Garden greens with (balsamic?) dressing and a few good-sized pieces of smoked duck. Pretty big salad for an ayce menu though, but still yummy!

Gyoza: 1.5/5 stars
Perfectly sized (...BIG) dumplings fried to an eye-appealing golden brown that will have you salivating at the sight of them.  Then you take your first bite and expect a juicy bold flavour, a traditional meaty texture, and maybe a little crunch. But you will very soon be baffled by a bland mushy filling and a wash of disappointment.

Service: 2/5
Polite, genuine, but not professional. It might've been just this one server, and maybe he was new and not fully trained (still inexcusable), but my dinner date assured me that they're usually much better.  My first criticism is that he didn't know the wine that I ordered by half litre... like dude, it's a pretty typical wine that is offered by the glass as well. Second, I respect all servers that take orders without writing them down.  I  am guilty of that myself. But you have to be sure you can remember them all!!  Well he didn't.  It took 2 reminders and about 20 minutes later for our salad to come out. A couple other dishes needed reminders too.  Our last orders were ridiculous! A couple hot dishes took about half an hour... all the while we had NO food on the table.  It's not just the service of our server, but the execution of the food in the kitchen too, it just took way too long!  Had the server been more professional, the least you can do is come by and check on us and apologize or explain why it's taking so long. Furthermore, there were also mistakes made such as chicken instead of beef, or just dishes arriving that we did not order.  This the main reason behind dropping jj's rating by 0.5 star...I am tempted to make it a full star!

Overall, a very good and tasty experience.  I am so glad a place like this exist, and maybe Mississauga isn't so bad after all.  The food and atmosphere was great! I am definitely coming back... hopefully with better service next time."}

{"text":"Great food my favorites are coconut shrimp, mango chicken, pad thai Noodles, red curry thai and many more. I gave 1 star less as they add 15% tip in the bill but service is not friendly."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, felt upscale. Staff were friendly enough. Food was slightly under par. Wonton soup had a very bland broth. Mango salad had a nice citrus/mint flavour. Pad See Ew was decent. All in all, not worth a trip back but I'm sure it's great for quiet dining if that is what you're looking for."}
{"text":"This is my goto sushi spot in Mississauga. Because they have very high quality sushi for very reasonable prices. Check out their catering menu. They also have an AYCE menu that is the same price as other sushi joints in town. Quality is very good and large selection of different types of foods. Only downfall is they do not have desserts included with the AYCE menu but I can live with that to get high quality sushi."}
{"text":"What I like about this place is that its incredibly fancy looking, and when you walk in you're like \"...I don't know if I can afford it\" but you look at the menu and the prices are really good.

The portions are not very big, we shared a Chicken Curry Pad Thai with two rolls. The curry pad thai had good flavour, but not incredibly impressive. The taste was not strong enough for Thai flavours, but I like that they have enough vegetables/tofu/chicken in the dish. 

The sushi was good, but again, not absolutely amazing. We had the dynamite roll and the golden dragon and it tasted good. I wish it was a fatter roll with more substance.

The waiters are so nice there, they kept filling our waters and didn't rush us out even though we sate maybe 30 min longer after our meal finished. The service is also pretty fast, but when I went, it wasn't very full (Wednesday night)."}
{"text":"Looking on the outside of the restaurant, it does not look ideal and or inviting. When you go inside the interior is modern and upscale. 

The service itself was decent, the servers tried to keep up with our orders but a very long, long wait. A friend was waiting on his first order when we were all on our fifth order sort of situation. There was always many items missing each round. The food was alright.

Management sucked, he tried to pull a scam but we were too keen on him and called him out. He was caught in many web of lies. What a shady bhsiness.

Final verdict: boycott."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: AYCE is only for dinner. Somehow I missed that memo but I made do and ordered a la carte (to the detriment of my wallet) for lunch. My options became suddenly limited so I ordered:
Tempura roll/maki -- it was only okay, nothing special. Even though it was a large portion it was NOT worth the $11 price tag.
Calamari -- this is what earned this place a 3-star instead of 2-star rating! Amazing calamari. HUGE portion and great price ($8). If there was something like a meal-sized calamari this would be it. It filled me right up and it was delicious, from the batter, to the sauce, to the buttery calamari. Up there with the tenderest calamari I have had. A++ on the calamari. Moving on..
Pad thai -- nothing much to say about it. It was a decent portion, but it was more soy saucy and less sweet than I personally prefer.
One thing that really bugged me is that they charged me $3 for a tiny pot of green tea. I am trying to think back and I could be wrong, but I don't think I have EVER been charged for green tea at a Japanese restaurant before. Like, ever. That kind of put me off but maybe I'm way out of line expecting the tea to be gratis.
I live close to JJ and I might return to get a takeout order of calamari (for obvious reasons), but I doubt I will be dining in again."}
{"text":"Soooooo.............. slooooooow.

Any order took half an hour and every order was wrong. We got food we didn't order, even before anything was ordered. 

Got to a point where the waitress said to just eat whatever on the plate that was only half of what was ordered, otherwise it would be another long wait. 

Left because I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. The bill came super fast."}
{"text":"Could have been better. Went there for AYCE on New Years Eve, found it hard to order and had to wait a long time for food to come. Also dessert wasn't even included, not even fruit or a scoop of ice cream!"}
{"text":"We visited JJ'S last month but never got a chance to write a review.
The three of us visited on a weekday expecting the buffet but they only served buffets on the weekend.  Instead of looking for our AYCE Japanese restaurant we decided to eat at JJ'S.  To our surprise they had just received their shipment of fish from Japan so we ordered two of their specialty sashimi dishes.
We were blown away with the quality and freshness  of  there fish.  We highly recommend this restaurant for their fresh fish"}
{"text":"Newly renovated. Including the menu and sushi!   Actually tastes much better - fresh wasabi, sushi and sashimi.  Good job."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with cozy spaces and comforting decor.  Great thai curry dishes and spring rolls.  Green tea served was very good.  Server was helpful and attentive.  Lots of parking outside."}
{"text":"The food itself is worth 5 stars. Unfortunately the service is what made it loose points. Honestly service is not even 1 star. The weekend all you can eat buffet staff is incredibly inattentive to the point of being obnoxious. After taking the initial order it was very difficult to get anyone's attention to ask for more food or a refill on the water. The server that took our order was literally missing in action for the entire time we were sitting there until it came time to pay the bill.

We ordered a soup and after we had finished everything else we reminded them that our soup had yet to make an appearance. We ordered a mango shake for the 2 year old that was in our group and it came in a glass that was overflowing and incredible messy (it left puddles of mango on the table just by her walking it to our table and setting it down). Impossible for a two year old to drink from. We had to ask for another glass to be able to portion it out for the child.

We had to steal a spoon and soya sauce from the next table because they were not provided to us. And no one was around that we could ask for it.

To keep the 2 year old occupied I provided her my pen. But the pen was ripping the paper table cloth so we asked them if they had a pencil she could use. Then one of the servers offered us crayons. Really? Why not offer those to us as soon as you set up the table with the highchair for us? 

So basically if you go. Go for the food. The decor is lovely. But the service does not match the ambiance. Don't expect to be waited on by the staff. You will have to ask for every little thing including water refills and telling them how to serve a child. Servers disappear for long stretches of time and when they do appear they will not hear you calling for them. You have to be loud and obnoxious to get a response.

I have been a few times for the buffet this year and the service has been consistently bad. I prefer to just get takeout from here as then I don't have to deal with the service. But the buffet is so yummy occasionally I do go back. And when I leave I am just more stressed and remember how bad the service always is."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant twice and I couldn't believe they were the same restaurant. The first time wasn't a bad experience. In a dark dimly lit cool Asian vibed restaurant, we had decent service and foodt. We had the Thai green curry and Pad Thai. The price was a bit on the higher side for the quality and amount of food but it wasn't unreasonable. I do think the portions were a bit small and probably a bit more cheap rice noodle carbs in the dishes than actual real meat or vegetables.

The second time we went back, we were really disappointed. The sushi pizza was really awful. It felt like they used an hour old deep fried rice patty underneath the salmon. The salmon was slightly frozen still too. The mango chicken was not great. It seemed really small and some of the pieces of chicken had inedible grizzle or tendon in it. To make matters worse, the service was so slow!! When we complained about the food, all we got was a simple response of 'Oh ok' and then they went on clearing another table. We're not going back."}
{"text":"I went to JJ's last Thursday with my work team. The decor was fancier than I expected. It was a pleasant surprise. The waiter was exceptionally polite which was an added bonus. 

We ordered appetizers: coconut shrimp, thai spring rolls and calamari. The spring rolls were mediocre, calamari and coconut shrimp was better. 

I ordered the pad see ew! This is one of my favourite dishes back in Vancouver. Pad see ew is basically stir fried rice noodles. I didn't really expect it to match the one in Vancouver. When I got the food, I tasted it and it was alright. The taste was a bit bland and very oily compared to what I am use to. It was too oily for my taste. 

My co-worker ordered the \"street pad thai\", something like that and I liked that a lot more with the aromatic flavours and tanginess. 

Overall, the place is fancier than a lot of regular thai places I've been to. If I ever go back again, I'm hoping to try the Japanese side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"What happened. Absolutely loved this restaurant previously. Went here all the time. They have completely changed their menu to an \"asian fuzion\" whatever that means. They sell garlic bread appetizer now. Eliminated all you can eat option which we loved. Changed many of the flavours of the menu items and much less choices. Sushi portions are smaller. Had to send back my meal as it was burnt. Totally disappointed with the menu changes. Decor changes are nice but has a modern feel now, feels less cozy. So upset with food choices I would not go back or recommend anymore."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is really nice - the furniture and decor is classy and there's a nice ambiance about the room.

The food here wasn't so great the last few times I've been, including today. There was too much rice on the sushi and it was a lot more dense/heavy than it was supposed to be. Some of the tempura stuff that was served at the table wasn't fully cooked or didn't have enough crisp. Alternately, the shrimp seems rubbery and overcooked or something. The miso soup I had was room temperature and not served hot at all. The other stuff was just okay. 

The service was very prompt, although they did have the bad habit of taking dishes away before asking if we were done with them and they weren't really overly friendly. 

Overall, it was an okay experience, but for that price, I expected better or some sort of improvement from the last time I came. At some point, or maybe even now, it might be the last time I go there."}
{"text":"Oh dear, the quality of JJ's has definitely declined. I went to JJ's on September 7th and 1) found a piece of circular plastic in my miso soup and 2) had someone's water glass explode all over me. I'd informed the manager of the piece of hard plastic and all he said was, do you want another miso soup? I mean, really?!! What if it had been my child drinking the soup and she'd choked on it? See my picture attached. Then incident #2 happened when the girl beside our table was leaving. She took a drink as she was getting ready to leave, then when the glass slipped out of her hand, it shattered into a million pieces when it came into contact with the soft leather sofa. How does that even happen? I've never seen glass break like that before! It didn't fall onto a hard surface and the girl was definitely not strong enough to crush the glass in her hand. Again, management did nothing about it, nor did they come see if I was ok or did anyone come pick up the broken glass. I will DEFINITELY NOT BE GOING BACK THERE!! The food quality is on the decline and with the lack of attention to detail by the staff and management there, this last experience at JJ's left a sour taste in my mouth. Spread the news!"}
{"text":"Tiny portions is the main reason I don't think I'll be back soon.

$10 to $12 for menu items seems like a good deal until you realize the food is basically the size of tapas.. 
Our mixed vegetables dish was so small!
Cashew chicken was good but the tamarind shrimp is not something I'd order again..

Not the greatest value.. And you run the risk of thinking you are getting a full meal when you are definitely not..

Nice ambiance though.. Very beautiful and cool looking restaurant..

My meal was nice. I just don't think I'll come back very soon."}
{"text":"Coming from Port Credit, I tend to have a 20-30 minute drive to get to JJ's. I certainly wouldn't be doing it if the food was just average! This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite restaurants in Mississauga. I always order the same things, but only because they're so delicious! I strongly recommend the curry pumpkin soup and the chicken satays. Best versions of both that I have ever tasted. Also recommend the butterfish sashimi and the basil beef. The service has been amazing 9 out of 10 times that I have come here. 
I highly recommend this place, and the decor is fairly upscale, so it would be a great spot for a date."}
{"text":"So heard about this spot and people were makin some loud noisehe good reasons! The service was great! Gotta give it up to our server who deserved the tip and was pretty funny. The food was delicious and they have lots of great choices. I would come back here to really just look at celebrating an occasion or one of those big events. Its pricier, if you have a little belly and are not comin to DO SOME SERIOUS EATING. $30 bucks a person for endless Buffet is a little overpriced for me, personally in Mississauga. But Listen, I will pay for it when I'm in that mood to EAT UP and be HAPPY :) Food makes all of us happy - so with that I would recommend this spot for atleast a one time visit and if you got the DOUGH, you better spend that money G! Dont forget to get the GREEN TREE CREME BRULEE  to finish, cos if anything - you would genuinely go back for that!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!

As an sushi lover, I am always looking for new places to get my fix. This restaurant offers a large assortment of Japanese and Thai food, although to be honest so far I have only had the sushi there, which has been nothing but fresh and delicious. Expect to pay about $15 per person. 

What really sets JJ apart is the trendy decor! The interior design could be compared to an Earls or Milestones, with an Asian twist. JJ has a slight lounge feel to it, with exposed stone, white tablecloths and chandelier lighting. The restaurant is sprinkled with Asian elements such as Buddha statues and calligraphy plates. The long, dark wood, candlelit bar is the perfect spot for an apres-work drink and app. 

The restaurant loses one star for service, as there may be times where your server is nowhere to be found- but all in all a must try."}
{"text":"We have come here a couple times for work lunch and each time they have easily seated a group of 5+ people without a problem. The food is mediocre at best, not near what I would consider authentic Thai food. For example, they don't use the proper type of noodles for pad see ew (although from what I hear, this is a problem with Thai food in the GTA in general) or the proper vegetables. As a warning, when you order tea, you will not receive a communal teapot. Instead, each person who gets tea will have their own teapot. The service is also lacking a bit as others have mentioned.

Update:
We found out that you can get 10% off your order if you order take-out. Also, the best item on the menu is the Bankok street style pad thai. Warning: it's very spicy."}
{"text":"I came here for the AYCE Brunch on a Saturday morning. I believe it was under $25 pr person. The place was very nicely decorated as I wasn't expecting much from other AYCE places in the city. The service was friendly and the restaurant definitely felt more high end compared to other sushi places. Their menu is a little different from the other AYCE places in the city. They had more Thai dishes/curry and stir fry, and some other items like escargot, but fewer selection with maki rolls. Their sashimi was fresh and sizes were generous.  I was a big fan of their stir fry dishes. The rolls were average. Overall, a really good experience!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend for her birthday on a Tuesday night and it was hella quiet which was fabulous. The waiter was quite nice and gave us enough time to decide what to eat even though we were quite indecisive. He started off by getting us our drinks.

To start I had the mango salad and my friend had the lemongrass soup. My mango salad had a lot of flavour but the mango was not ripe enough so it was more tart than I would have liked. My friend enjoyed the lemongrass soup but not for $5. We then ordered the deep fried chicken wontons with Thai chili sauce, green curry with chicken, and Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai with beef.

The deep fried wontons were slightly disappointing since they had maybe 1 tsp of filling in each one. Still was tasty. The green curry was a level 2 spice and wow was it spicy for me lol. It was pretty good. I really enjoyed the Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai with beef. These noodles were like regular pad thai but had chives, sweet & sour tamarind sauce, and dried chilies.

I would definitely go back here again. Everything was tasty and service was excellent."}
