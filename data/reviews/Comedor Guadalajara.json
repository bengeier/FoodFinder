{"text":"I love this place their  Service is great and their food is Amazing. They have the best green chile chicken enchiladas. The only thing I wasn't to fond of was the chile relleno but everything else is so good. Real Authentic Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Great food! Slower on the service side."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food in the whole valley, I been going there since I was a child and they only get better with time.My favorite is carne asada and grilled chicken on there fire skillet, mmm."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this restaurant until what happened to me on April 3rd.  I invited some guests to dine with us, the meal was as always excellent, and service was decent.  All was fine until I got a call 90 minutes after leaving the restaurant from my credit card company at 10pm asking me if I was at Frys Grocery and had just before been at Home Depot, seeing as I was at home I replied no.  I had left my credit card in the check presenter and somehow it made it's way to into someones hands that obviously was not me.  To say I was annoyed would be an understatement, that is until I called the owner the next day and explained the gravity of the situation, she had the nerve to tell me that it was basically my fault and that her staff would never do anything like that and that she would do nothing about it, not even an apology!! In the days of Social Media, not taking customers seriously is risky business, i have shared this story with 50 plus people and I am sure they have shared it with some more.  I have left my credit card at several restaurants over the years and have always been confident in the honesty of a business and next day retrieved it and not had someone go shopping in my absence.  Visit this restaurant at your own peril and if you have to pay cash!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best for legit Mexican breakfast.  Machaca and Chilaquilles is very good and so is the enchiladas and napolitos.  I have only been for breakfast but can imagine the other food is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Some people must have different taste buds ,I have been here about 5 times over a span of 6years , never once have I enjoyed it ,
Every time I say oh let's give it a try and I regret it I've tried enchiladas burritos tacos crane asada this is no where near the real thing , the last time I think there was lettuce in the guacamole maybe by accident but it made me sick"}
{"text":"This place is bomb as hell!! 30 min to 1 hour wait but worth it! enchiladas are awesome! horchata is awesome. you get what you pay for definitely. 1 con I have. the flour tortillas are good but a little to thin for my liking... but! that does not mean they are not good.  give this place a try. you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food in Phoenix and boy do they feed you!! Authentic food at great prices. The only downside is sometimes there is a really long wait, especially on the weekends...but, that is only because half of Phoenix is trying to eat there."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a child. It's my parents' go to place for taking visiting family out for dinner. I've seen it go through remodeling and expanding to what it is now. The prices have gone up considerably but the food is as good as ever. Delicious! None of that canned beans shit."}
{"text":"This place is the truth. It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. Awesome. Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony."}
{"text":"The first thing to remember is that the portions are huge and the plates are always burning hot. Every time I visit, I come away with a plate full of left overs. Do not expect to find any fancy dishes here, the food is what you may find at a comidas caseras type of place in Mexico. The Mexican food here has the tastes of Sonora and is full of flavor.

There have been two items that have been ordered that I really did not like. The chilaquiles during breakfast and fried fish for dinner. The fried fish was almost burned and super oily. The chilaquiles are smothered in sauce, which I had never seen. It must be a Sonora thing. You can not go wrong here if you order something that is grilled, whether it be tacos de carne asada, pollo asado, or a parrillada, etc. The enchiladas and chile rellenos are good, but again they are smothered in sauces which is not typical from the part of Mexico my family is from.

Bottom line, this restaurant serves good Mexican food, the portions are huge, and is inexpensive."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible for calling themselves an authetican mexican restaurant they are far from it. I am mexican and I can tell you their food is not at all good. Their tortillas are package their chips are package. The food has no taste. Not even my kids the usually eat everything like it. Their salsa sucks. I do not recommend this place horrible food. If you want good mexican food go to Pitic just around the corner or Carolinas."}
{"text":"Just when it seemed like I couldn't be impressed by a Mexican restaurant anymore, here comes Comedor Guadalajara. When so many others stopped offering free chips and salsa while you wait I was SHOCKED by not only getting chips and salsa but a cup of soup while waiting for our meal. We went in for lunch, and while we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table, the service was awesome and we were in and out quickly. They do not mess around here and I was thoroughly impressed. The food was close to the Tex Mex that I crave from home and the value for the money is solid. The chili rellanos was killer. Will be back regularly!"}
{"text":"Not quite up to the expectation given that this has 4 stars on yelp, is frequented by lots of Latinos and the half hour wait for a table for two t lunchtime. The guacamole had no flavor and the main dishes were very average. Nice ambience though."}
{"text":"Este restaurante lo unico que tiene de Guadalajara es el nombre.  Todo es comida chicana muy malita.  En el escusado habia un hombre semi desnudo aseandose...que asco. 

Verguenza ajena"}
{"text":"Still on the quest for good Mexican food, I tried this place with a coworker who swore that I would love it.  Not so.

We went at lunch and the waiting area was packed!  We put our names down and they called us 10 minutes later (not bad for how many people were waiting).  They have a large dining area and lots of parking.

When we sat down, they brought us chips and salsa and soup.  The soup was yummy.  The chips were disgusting -- you could taste the grease that they were fried in (YUCK!).  

I ordered the beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch special.  The taco was decent (very small) and the cheese enchilada had onions in it which were crunchy when you bit into them.  I thought I ordered a cheese enchilada but I guess they forgot to put cheese AND onion enchilada on the menu.  I still judge a place by it's beans and these were nasty.  You could taste the lard.  My coworker ordered the chile relleno and chicken enchilada lunch special.  She didn't like her food either.  

After we left, she apologized and admitted she would probably never go there again either."}
{"text":"This place was overall delicious I ordered 3 carne asada tacos with rice and beans. I was more than content with my meal choice. My date ordered a small bowl of albondigas with a side of green Chile chicken enchiladas she was pleased as well with the food. One negative, they could flavor their rice a bit more it was bland with no flavor. I have had better out of a instant minute packet rice. Other than that service was great, and the restaurant is well maintained."}
{"text":"As someone who is very picky when it comes to Mexican food....I have to say, hands down this is the place to go...their food is delish... salsa is amazing. We have been living in phx for 10 years and barely found this joint about 4 years ago.... every time we try another Mexican restaurant,  we feel so stupid! This is the best place to go. Sure the wait times suck....but it is definitely worth it! Try try try....Oh Yea...they don't have tamales..  but they have everything else! #YummyBeans #DeliciousRice #BombDotCom"}
{"text":"My family and I have been dining here for a few years now. Only thing I don't like are the odd hours, because it can be confusing at times. Seriously. There was a time we went to have lunch sometime during the week, and it was 3pm. When we got there, they were closed.

Anyway, the food is great. The service isn't bad; not AMAZING, but not bad. :)"}
{"text":"Great food, decent service, great atmosphere make this a great restaurant for lunch or dinner. Had the carne asada plate and it was great. The beef was grilled over a flame and it made the beef taste great. Soup was delicious and chips and salsa outstanding. A little pricey, but the quality makes it worth the price!"}
{"text":"Pro: Great food, Huge food portion, Quality is there. 

Cons: Plates are served too hot (be careful if your bringing little ones) and bathrooms are so unsanitary. The baby changing station is never wiped down. IF they can spend a little money renovating their restrooms it would be more pleasant to eat at----"}
{"text":"This is a great establishment. Great food, great drinks, and most importantly great customer service. The employees are nothing but kind and friendly. You feel like you are important when you dine here. I can't say enough on how much I love this place. Please please never lose your amazing customer service. It is hard to come by these days and it definitely makes your business unique and appreciated!!"}
{"text":"My family and I found this restaurant through yelp when in Phoenix for vacation.

Everything about this restaurant was awesome. When waiting for our seats, we met a bunch of great people.

Once we were seated, the service was nothing short of extraordinary.

Finally, the food. Large servings at a great price, and arguably some of the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life. The food is authentic and delicious. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in Phoenix and will definitely be coming back next time I am here. 

I would give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Had family in town and they wanted to have authentic Mexican food. The first place that came to mind was here! I had been here before but for a work function 3 years ago. Got the fajitas plate for two with my mother. I couldn't believe how much food they brought out! Everyone at my table ate their food and had some of ours. We still left with left overs!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Incredible, authentic, delicious food!  My grandparents were very good friends with the owner since the \"Flautas Restaurant\" inception (now Comedor Guadalajara) - the evolution of this incredible family has been a joy to be a part of.  We are forever customers!!"}
{"text":"Place is big service is great been there twice love it very generous with the plates. Love the oysters could not get them lay visit but that was okay. Lil pricey but it's cool for date night or talking guest to a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Best place I have been ! Me and my hubby have been going there for the last 10 years and we love it . I always order the chile relleno with taco Dinner . My hubby gets shrimp enchiladas green and they are so good also . I love it I can really say it one of the best Mexican restaurants in phoenix"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food in Phoenix! Wonderful service, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow, went here with a buddy of mine.  He's a local and kept telling me how good it was.  And, I was not disappointed in the least.  You will not go wrong with this place!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is AMAZING! 
MUCH BETTER THAN THE CHAIN MEXICAN RESTAURANTS
I usually go around lunch time and I always get the Shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada plate.
BEWARE THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS 
If you go during the lunch period of 10:45-1:30 allow yourself 2 hours because there is almost always a 30 minute wait but IT IS WORTH THE WAIT!
Parking is crazy too, the lot is always full"}
{"text":"Great and has been for years.  Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait.  I recommend combo 'K'

This place is the where you should take someone from out of town that wants the best mexican food."}
{"text":"I love this place, I've been here many times for lunch.  #1, they have excellent salsa, when you look around and you see who else is sharing in your dining experience, a lot of repeat customers who know that the quality of the food is up there with the best.  The Salsa is fresh and HOT!  #2, its authentic, having come from a family of restaurant entrepreneurs in West Texas I know all about Mexican food, how it's made and whether something is fresh or not.  Let me tell you, this place is legit.  #3, the service is always fast and friendly.  The only opportunity they have is with their Huevos Rancheros, im a fan of Rancheros but their Ranchero sauce was heavy on the tomato sauce and onion, I felt needed more complexity and adding in some Hatch or Anaheim long green would have made the sauce better.  Other than that, I highly recommend the tacos, chimichangas, flautas, enchiladas and Menudo.  You won't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat authentic Mexican food! Your server always bring out chips and salsa first thing while you look over the menu (salsa is spicy and really good).  The dinner combos are very reasonable and you get a good portion size.  My boyfriend and I usually go once a week to eat here."}
{"text":"Being a Mexican food junkie I'm tough to please..  This place was absolutely amazing.  We had the ceviche appetizer and had the chicken molé as my main dish.  It reminded me of good ol fashion home cooking.  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys really good Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food in all of Arizona. If it wasn't for the loooong wait to be seated and that they don't take reservations, they would have gotten 5 stars. I always recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"I've long been searching for the best camarones diabla and have found that gem here in their camarones endiablados offering. This spicy seafood dish hit all the right notes!  

My husband also loved their cheese crisp and cheese enchiladas. 

I've not been to Mexico but I would bet this is real deal Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!
The prices are Great and the food is soooooo good!
The service is the best ive ever had at any restaurant in the valley, hands down.
They have security in the parking lot and that shows the owner cares about her customers :) 
I go as often as I can and you should too"}
{"text":"I can't believe that they don't splint the tab here.Totally unprofessional,as the Manager should consider of the fact that things are obviously incorrect, to be addressed here.Please support me.This Bitch waitress put a 18% on tips,when she's not worth a single tip.The chicken is we're just chips on the table with the addition of 24 dollars on top.Never coming back......"}
{"text":"New favorite sit-down restaurant for Mexican food in all of metro-Phoenix. Take it from this Texican.... this is the closest style to Tex-Mex food.

The test: Beans... check. Chile Relleno... check.

Authentic. Fast, excellent Service. Nice soups to start. Great Chips. Chip sauce is great (not salsa but the flavor is awesome). Oh, and lots of food and low prices. I'm embarrassed that it took me so long to find/try/discover this place.

Gitty up!"}
{"text":"I had been craving good ceviche de camarones since I moved to AZ from CA. A friend told us about this place, and we finally made the 45 minute trek from Peoria to see what the hype was about. Comedor Guadalajara did not disappoint! Their shredded beef taco was delicious, and the ceviche de camarones was to die for!! The service is fantastic, and the atmosphere enjoyable. Totally worth the drive, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time after driving by this restaurant for about a year.  The chips and salsa were great.  I ordered a cheese enchilada, taco and tostada combo.  It was very reasonably priced.  The rice and taco were very good.  The beans and enchilada were so-so.  I will return as some of the neighboring tables had some unique dishes that looked pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been here a bunch of times, thanks to a coworker who recommended it for authentic, good Mexican.  I'm trying to think of everything I've tried here:  the Wednesday lunch special of chicken in a light mole sauce, chicken soup, cheese enchiladas, burrito all delicious.  The service is fast, the food is always good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food, we are in town for the weekend and tried them out. Not much from the outside, but wait until you are seated. Beautiful, quiet dining and excellent food. Service was perfect."}
{"text":"I was extremely happy with my meal here.  The salsa with the chips was nicely spicy.  I had the shrimp and octopus a la Diavolo.  The Diavolo sauce was delicious and also spicy in a different way than the salsa for the chips.  I was given a large flour tortilla and couldn't resist dipping and redipping.  The sides of salad (standard shredded lettuce, etc., but very fresh and crunchy), rice and refried beans were substantial.  After the chips, main course, salad rice and tortilla I couldn't do more than scratch the surface of the refried beans.  

I was equally happy with the atmosphere and service.  I showed up near 1pm on Sunday as a single diner.  Most of the other people were family groups, many apparently regulars.  I was nonetheless given a decent table normally seating four after the promised 10-15 minute wait and no sense of being rushed or treated differently by any of the staff.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be eager to come back (bringing family and/or friends) and have the same thing again and/or explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I don't get it. For some reason, people seem to think Comedor Guadalajara represents traditional, authentic Mexican cuisine. If that's the case, so do Acapulco, El Torito, Arriba and Macayo's.
Nevermind the location. I have strayed into much more intimidating parts of other cities and towns and come out unscathed. Anyone who is concerned about the location or the security guard will either feel that they were adventurous threatened. You can decide for yourself which to pick.
AS FOR THE FOOD... it's horribly average. Yes they make a good michelada, but the food itself is too fried, has too much lard, and just doesn't have much charm.
I don't want cheddar cheese on my Mexican food. I don't want Jack In The Box style tacos. I don't need beans and rice on the same plate.
The green chile is better at Carolina's or Rito's or El Norteno.

If you want fatty americanized Mexican food, go to Comedor. If not, I suggest you skip it."}
{"text":"Day trip to Phoenix.  We asked a girl at the car rental counter for a good place to eat.  She recommended Comedor Guadalajara. 
The place was packed and it was Tuesday at 9am.
I ordered the Chilaquiles, Machaca and Huevos. 
it was delicious.  Last time I had chilaquiles this good... I was in mexico.  
The beans were delicious...the flour tortilla was huge.  
I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service there is a bit of a wait but well worth it! Adults drinks are on point too!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mex food in the valley.  Chorizo bean dip and cubed beef red enchiladas are my go to.  Also, the land and sea platter is amazing.  The sope they serve with lunch service is completely addicting.  Hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. You have a line of guys standing at the front just waiting to serve you. Great chips and decent salsa. I love the specials board, though I am still a little hesitant to break down and try the Tripas. The seafood can be pricey but that can be expected in the middle of the deserts. Amazing enchiladas and haven't had a bad thing yet. 

The dining room is massive with a couple different sections, so you typically don't have to wait, though there are a lot of people there. It can be a little scary looking from the outside since it is right off the freeway in a fairly scarce neighborhood. There is also a security guard in the parking lot to add some mystique. However, once you get yourself in the restaurant you are put to ease by the comfortable seating and laid back atmosphere. Typically too stuffed for dessert, so someone else will have to clue you in on that."}
{"text":"Great food. Fantastic staff. Coldest cheladas in town. I mean largest and tastiest and coldest cheladas. The food is delicious. That is the only reason for going out to eat at this place. The best parilla here in Az."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places for Mexican food! Their seafood is very very good! I usually order the shrimp tacos and shrimp enchiladas. I've had other things listed on the menu, however here is the place to eat if you want to eat quality Mexican seafood."}
{"text":"Old School and super delicious. Beef and potato tacos were great. Carnitas tacos exceptional."}
{"text":"It is the best Mexican restaurant in the valley. I dislike Mexican food normally but this is only Mexican food I will eat"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!  Prices are very reasonable and staff provides great service.  I've been looking for a replacement for my favorite Mexican spot since mine closed last year.  This is it!"}
{"text":"When it comes to authentic Mexican food, this place does it right!  None of the \"Tex-Mex\" silliness here. I always get their flautas, beans and rice. The rice isn't like mom's but THE FLAUTAS are just like mom's!!! Yeah, it's by the old freeway in the non gentrifying part of downtown, but the portions and taste make this place worth driving a little off the beaten path. Lunch is always busy but once you are seated the wait is never long. I always suggest this place as a lunch spot for lunch meetings! Go now, thank me later."}
{"text":"One of my earliest memories is going here for dinner. Nearly 2 decades later and i still love it.This place has always been quality. I will admit i have my regular dish but when i do feel like trying somethimg new i am never disappointed. Salsa is some of the best in PHX."}
{"text":"Anyone that calls what they serve here chilaquiles has never had a decent plate of chilaquiles in their life.  I was really disappointed to say the least when I was served a plate of soaked tortilla chips in a pasty, canned-tomato sauce... My husband said his huevos rancheros were ok, but then again he'll eat anything.  The place was getting pretty full for lunch, so maybe other menu items were better Phoenix, AZ 85008than the sad and pathetic dish that I got."}
{"text":"Many people have told me about Guadalajara and I finally got the opportunity to try it. I was very impressed. The food tasted authentic and full of flavor. I didn't find it to be bland like many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. They have the largest dining rooms I have ever seen. They have 3 full size dining rooms which minimizes any wait for a table. My only complaint was the waiter was slow and paid very little attention to our table. I was there for a little over 2 hours and never received a refill to my drink. If it wasn't for the great quality of food I may have left upset."}
{"text":"I usually eat at fast/cheap Mexican places because I am not a fan of places like Garcias, macayos, Arriba etc but I have been looking for a good/authentic sit down Mexican food restaurant for a while. After I saw that this place had a 4 star rating and a name in Spanish I decided to give it a try. I was pretty excited to see actual Mexicans eating there! When the chips and salsa arrived my excitement died a bit but I try not to judge on chips and salsa alone. We ordered a plain cheese crisp as an appetizer and it was actually pretty good; it was crispy and not too oily. The main dishes arrived and they were a major disappointment! The tacos were oily and bland. The beans and rice were not much better. Overall this is typical Americanized Mexican food; overly fried, bland, and greasy like most Mexican places. Nothing special or authentic here. I shan't be returning. My search continues..."}
{"text":"If I can give it zero star, I would.

The lady brought out the spicy salsa for us.  There are 10 of us in the group going there for a birthday lunch.  We complained the salsa was too hot and asked if she has something else.  She said there is nothing less spicy than that.  What?  I can eat spicy but this was super spicy.  Hmmm...

The food wasn't good either.  The beans and the rice were just not good.  I ordered the flauntas and it was way too greasy."}
{"text":"So this is not a bad review, it's just a review from someone who lives in Dallas and eats Tex-Mex all the time. When we arrived, we had to be flagged into a parking space by one of their parking attendant (very nice feature) as the lot was very full. There was a 45 min. wait and lots of people waiting! We met a family who used to live in McAllen, Tx, and they raved about this place, so we decided to wait it out, esp. after all the other good Yelp reviews. It's in an interesting part of town, so it wasn't like there was another Mexican restaurant five min. away like at home. Hubs had the carne asada tacos and I had the combo #8. The beef was outstanding! Good flavor and charred to perfection!!! Large portions! The rest of the meal (beans, rice, tortillas, taco & guacamole) were good, but we're very, very spoiled Texans. If we lived here full-time, this would be our place definitely, but compared to home, this was a good, but nothing to 110% rave about. However, the service, mango margarita's and warm churro (soooooo good!) sundae allow us to overall give it the four star rating."}
{"text":"Had tripas, it was amazing  of course I had to throw a carne asada taco on the side !! delicious!!"}
{"text":"Decent food and nice service. We've all had great Mexican food and this is not the Greatest but it's not bad. It's very popular and the atmosphere is nice. 

I've only been there once and would return."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food at its best! They have a variety of options on their menu that taste like homemade authentic Mexican. 
The place is very big and can get very busy before lunch on the weekends. So plan on waiting, it's worth the wait. 
The drinks are very tasty also, try the michelada, margaritas, and ice cold beers. 
My favorite dish is the machaca con huevos. 

Definitely worth the drive and wait. I go at least once a month."}
{"text":"I love Comedor Guadalajara.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  

I have rarely been disappointed, but  when I have been disappointed it was when I tied something different from what I normally order.   I typically order the same items over and over again (because I know what I like) and those selections are always fabulous.

The salsa is hot (some times it is really HOT) and the soup is soooo good.  

If you have not been and you like good Mexican food; you must try it."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The food is great and the place always seems busy. The staff is friendly and suprisingly the best thing about this place is the Horchata. I normally have it and am sick afterwards because it is sooooooo sweet. Comedor's has a good mellow sweetness.

Food wise I had the lengua tacos it was really \"spicy\" not like hot spicy but like a lot fo different tastes in it. My boyfriend had oh I can't remember the burrito but it had chicken, peppers, and onion. i don't like peppers and onions but the green sauce that they had put on it was sooooo good. I wish I had got some green enchiladas or something. 

Now correct me if I am wrong, why are there no Tamales? I couldn't find any? Do they not serve any or did I miss it somewhere?  That was my only complaint I went in looking for tamales but hey I got something better so I guess it's not really a complaint then huh?"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed coming here. Even when there are long waits, everyone seems to be in good spirits knowing what's coming. The food and service is great. Best Mexican food anywhere. Love the carnitas plate!"}
{"text":"When you walk in and nearly everyone is Hispanic, you know you are getting the real deal.  Food is absolutely delicious, service outstanding, and it is cavernous inside.  No secret why they have been voted the best by New Times multiple years.  Would I come here again? Writing it from the table!  They are great!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant!!!! I love the authentic Mexican food like flautas. To be honest the Spanish rice could be babied more with more tomato sauce to make it more authentic though. You can't go wrong though for the price and quality."}
{"text":"Dear Comedor Guadalajara,

I love you. I miss you. I wish the lightrail went to your doorstep so I could visit you more often!! This is my vote for best Mexican food in the city. Just north of the Salt River on Central Avenue, in what looks like a failing industrial part of the city just seconds south of Downtown Phoenix is this amazing, beautiful gem of a mexican restaurant. 

With a large parking lot that is oftentimes full to the max, it can be a bit of a wait during peak eating hours. My best advice is to come during the off hours. I like 2PM on a saturday best. Everyone is bright and happy and the drinks are flowing (yes at 2PM, don't judge me!) and the salsa is SCORCHING hot! and the chips are yummy and the Beans N Chorizo Dip is incredible! If the salsa is too hot, ask for the mild and/or sour cream. The mild has no heat at all but is still flavorful and you can add as much of the hotter sauce to match your taste. It's delish. I like to order the plate that comes with green chilie relleno and a beef taco w/rice & Beans. My fave! 

This is a good place for large parties, as most tables can accommodate 6 people. and some tables in the back can host even more than that. I've totally seen like 3 birthday parties going on at the same time back there! it was awesome! I scored some free cake! LOL! 

The service is top notch with a super nice general manager who always manages to come by and say hi. I'm starting to think she recognizes me. I've seriously taken all of my friends to this place since rediscovering it two years ago. 

To my yelpers, I say: 
GO! Go now! Get that salsa and enjoy yourself! This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent staff, just an enjoyable experience all around.

Not fancy, no frills, inexpensive, hearty portions, and low prices. If you come here knowing what to expect, and look past the relatively plain decor, you will enjoy Comedor immensely. Especially the very large and tasty margaritas."}
{"text":"Comedor Guadalajara is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley. I highly recommend coming to this place. It has a great atmosphere; perfect for a work lunch, or even a date. When we arrived,we were greeted warmly by the two hosts. We were situated in one of their booths promptly. Our culinary experience began with a basket of chips and very delicious salsa. As an appetizer, we tried the Frijoles con Chorizo dip. One of the best I have had :) I also had Camarones y Pulpo a la Diabla 
(Shrimp & Octopus in hot chipotle sauce) . All I can say is I will definitely come back to try more of their dishes. It was absolutely phenomenal!! I also saw another table with Micheladas, so I will check those out as well."}
{"text":"Best enchiladas--ever! The enchiladas were as good as any I have ever tasted in San Antonio or Los Angeles.  Simple but delicious: Corn tortillas, enchilada sauce, cheese, and onions (optional). That's it.  And, that's all it takes.  It is rumored that I am the only person to have touched more cookies than a Keebler Elf. That might be true. The claims that Comedor Guadalajara has the best enchiladas in Phoenix. Well, simply put, that's true. These enchiladas are so good that if Comedor Guadalajara was in a rap battle it would simply pull back the foil on a plate of these hellafide gangsta enchildas and drop the Mic!"}
{"text":"My fav Mex food in the valley.  Chorizo bean dip and cubed beef red enchiladas are my go to.  The land and sea platter is also amazing.  Also, the sope they serve with your meal at lunch is the best."}
{"text":"We've been going here for 10 years or so. It's moderately expensive so eat here maybe once a year. Had forgotten how good the food is here. Negro Modelo on tap starts it all, the machaca is great, the chili rellanos are very mild, the standards are done well. Salsa is wonderful. 

Guards in the parking lot give you a feeling of being back in Mexico (and your car is safe), staff is friendly, bright inside, some nights there are roving mariachi groups."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic coastal Mexican food and good price. Parking situation is scetchy to say the least."}
{"text":"I always get consistent great food here. Very authentic mexican food a good selection for seafood."}
{"text":"Well, as you know, I like Machaca. I ate here today with a group from work. My red Chile enchilada style burrito was ok. Why no Machaca? Our server didn't want to split up the tab. these travelin' shoes won't be back."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I went to Comedor Guadalajara for supper.  I can't pronounce it but I found it.

It doesn't look like much on the outside, but it is quite comfortable and nicely done inside.  From the chips and salsa at the start to the blazing hot main course, the food was great.

I had a burrito, taco and cheese enchilada combo plate with rice and refried beans on the side.  The burrito was huge and tasty, the taco crisp and filled with fresh lettuce, and the rice and refried beans were tasty. The enchilada was so-so and it was the only disappointment.

The service was fair, a little disappointing given that it was not that busy.

The price is excellent for the food you get.  A real value!"}
{"text":"i took my in-laws here tonight, and it was their first time here. my mother in law said she wanted Mexican food and since Ponchos is not the same anymore this is the best place in town. everything that we ordered from the shredded beef tacos to the seafood soup were great. i had a green Chile chimichanga, the only disappointment was my mother in laws meal (chicken chimichanga) was taken by a different waitress and she didn't get her food till we were half way done with our food. otherwise it was great as usual."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for a birthday dinner. Place was packed. I was drinking, but the rest of my group enjoyed the cocktails.

Three of us split a mixed grill plate. Had enough for four as opposed to three. We opted for carne asada, carnitas, and chicken. Everything was prepared well and was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick lunch.  Daily lunch specials are pretty good.  Fast, friendly service.  Alphabet soup."}
{"text":"I was staying the night in Phoenix and being from New Jersey wanted to have some good southwestern Mexican food.  The desk clerk in our hotel recommended this place and I was not disappointed.  We ordered the shrimp ceviche, steak picado, and a enchilada, taco, tostada combination plate.  All of it was delicious.  Combined with a tall beer made for a great meal."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican breakfast spot. They have so much seating and they get the food out fast."}
{"text":"The only reason why checked this place out was because it was features on that show \"Man Vs Food\" well, I wasn't disappointed. The place was nice and friendly staff. So much to choose from. You better have a appetite for this. Unlimited chips and salsa can't go wrong with that. 
Reasonable food and prices. Definetely coming back. Happy customer."}
{"text":"Ci!

Comedor Guadalajara is a place that seems to always come up when discussing Phoenix Mexican food.  I finally found myself in the area and dropped by for early lunch and was not disappointed.

To the tourists and over cautious it may not look like the best area to be but have no worries.  This part of town is just old and run down.  You won't be knifed in the parking lot and there's even a security guard keeping an eye on the lot.  Have no fears.

As per usual when I hit a Mexican place I ordered the enchilada's.  The appetizer was the standard free house chips and salsa.  Oh, boy!  The salsa!  I always complain that the salsa in not hot enough (even at Mexican places) but one bite here and there was a temporary spice assault upon my eyes and nose.  Both started to run and I loved every minute.  When your body reacts, you know you're eating good salsa.  My Pepsi came soon after wards and it was the largest drink I've ever been served save for a liter of beer I had at a German tavern in New York City.

My food arrived soon after wards and it was served on a scorching hot plate.  Everything was delicious and I think they make their own refried beans.  Possibly the best beans I've had at a Mexican place.

The dining area is larger than a fast food joint but smaller than your typical restaurant.  Not long after I arrived it started to fill up quickly.  Expect to wait a few minutes at peak times.

Sadly this structure was an impenetrable fortress for my phone and I was unable to officially do a Yelp check in but, eh, I cannot hold that against the Comedor.

I'd like to note that quite a few of the patrons were Hispanic and that, to me, is always a good sign when eating at a Mexican joint.

I have been waiting to find a Mexican restaurant that I can officially dub as the best I've had.  I am confident I can dub thee, Comedor Guadalajara, as the best I have had.  Can't wait to take any visitors I have here."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to stumble upon a gem when I ordered takeout from here. After reading reviews on Yelp, I was hoping for a place that really focused on flavor. Unfortunately, this tasted like fast food more than it did authentic Mexican food. The salsa was sour, making me think it may have been expired. Not what I was expecting from this place at all."}
{"text":"The green enchilada sauce was homemade, really rich and full of flavor. Only downside is the wait to get a table."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant.  I been coming here since I can remember.  I do not think I dislike anything from the menu.   They also have great lunch specials.   Very casual and great rustic Mexican decor.   Family friendly or casual."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in the restraunt. We did not like the salsa. Margarita was so, so. We went there especially for the machaca and it also was only so, so. Preparation of machaca takes a very specific drying process. Theirs was clearly not done in the traditional way. I love oysters. I have no idea why but theirs tasted like crap."}
{"text":"Soo good. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for Mexican food!!!! So good, excellent service. Huge place as well!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Arizona. There's always a wait but never more than 20 minutes. There isn't one dish on the menu that isn't absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"To many rules. No split checks, no credit cards, no substitutions or additions, no breakfast after 11. Staff is nice, food is average."}
{"text":"Truely a mexican restaurant. The chilquiles are great, beans are fresh. It's not cluttered with tables, very open and feels warmly."}
{"text":"This place is so close to the airport that if you have a significant layover you could pull an Anthony Bourdain and catch a cab to Comedor Guadalajara. The food is sensational!  The green chile is flavorful and thick.  We had the specials of camarón with nopalitos in chile rojo served in a molcajete  as well as fajitas de carne asada and tripe. My Finance got the green chile shredded beef chimi smothered in green chile sauce enchilada style. She did this on a yelp recommendation. Comedor Guadalajara is the best Mexican food I've had in quite some time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a child. This place has changed for nothing but the better & it was great even back then. It gives me so many warm memories. It reminds me of my Nana's cooking & that's hard to come by. Great, great, great job!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Red chili burrito enchilada style and rice and beans. Delicious! Strawberry margarita was on point!"}
{"text":"OMG, I am so full! Wonderful food. I started with the highly rated michaladas then the shrimp diablo. Entirely way too much food for me!!!"}
{"text":"The food at the comedor is the closest in the valley I've had to my favorite taqueria in San Cristobal, Chiapas. Its a bit overpriced at dinner, and the portions are rather large. But I think it would be spot-on for some lunch fare."}
{"text":"Service Was bad but the the food was good.   Server never checked our table we would raise  our hand for drinks. Bad service."}
{"text":"I was here for the second meet up of the International Supper Club UYE. I thought that the first meet up was going to be hard to beat because it was so good but this place knocked another one out of the park. I think I just found my new favorite Mexican food place in town.
From the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family owned restaurant that has been here awhile for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope the food is good. We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat us even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. It was a large open space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. We were taken to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great job the entire night. Best services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders.
After what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out as well. One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good.
Then fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus started singing. Wow this was really good. I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't even finish. Although there wasn't too much left.
Even after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not a mistake. It was so good. The ice cream was fantastic and the churros were warm and soft.
Everything was amazing. Maria was a great server. The company was fantastic as usual. Maria even split the check up for us even though there was a handwritten sign up front that said they didn't do that.
I hope to have many return visits here. My new favorite Mexican place hands down."}
{"text":"We had been looking for a solid Mexican place that is genuine, but in the good way.. not that other way. This place delivered. When someone asks me if I know a good Mexican restaurant, this will be my recommendation. 

It has the standard quirks that Mexican restaurants usually comes with. What quirks you may ask? You know.. the quirks. Very roomy too, check out other customers pictures. They start you off with a tasty soup, that I only can imagine that is free. The prices can look like they are a bit on the high end for a place  like this (relative, they are not expensive), but then again when you have this rate of return customers, you can charge that little extra.. and you as a customer get it back in quality, and quantity. I didn't finish my full plate.

The chicken chimi.
A massive chimi. One! The size of 3 normal chimis. More than enough rice, more than enough beans covered with cheese. Yes, this seriously was not in my diet.. but I was hungry, and I got stuffed. I would definitely have this again. 

The waitresses is good and patient. No mistakes, and took our silly questions with a smile. No, I think I have found my go-to Mexican place for now. They deserve their reputation.. and they have been there forever, which means like 40 years or something."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican restaurant! I've been coming to this place since it was a tiny little place that only seated 20 people. I LOVE this place!!! Very authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. I have gone here regularly for a couple years and always order from the specials. Try the shrimp enchiladas or the fried red snapper. They are great!  Some of my friends drive all the way across the valley to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is legendary!! I have been eating here for 20 years and damn it hits the spot Everytime. It's a must try, I love the steak picado and ceviche."}
{"text":"First time at Comedor Guadalajara. The visit was prompted by a small birthday celebration so I shlepped to Phoenix by the I17 from Scottsdale. 
One should do anything for friends. 
Outside the packed parking lot (on a Friday at 11:45AM), wonderful smells emanated from the place.  The inside is super large with various sub rooms around the place here and there.  You can easily not find your party there if you don't look around enough. 

They had lunch specials ranging from about $8.95 to $10.50 or so.  All the specials included a small bowl of soup.  The waiters promptly placed soup bowls in front of every person even before they knew what they were going to order.  I wasn't ordering the lunch special but they gave me one anyway. I tasted it and it was nothing to write home about. The first bowl of chips and salsa are free, you pay a small amount if you request more.  Chips were fresh, not greasy and the salsa was kick-ass hot.  Nice.  
My party ordered the various lunch specials, most of them involving enchiladas with various sauces, burritos, etc.  They all ate without saying a word so I guess they were enjoying their food.  They all love Mexican food so what was to complain about? 
 I ordered a small bowl of menudo (tripe soup @$8.50)) because most Mexican places make it only on the weekends so I took advantage of the  fact that I was there on a Friday.  The person across from me ordered three chicken tacos from the regular menu that came with rice and beans at a cost of $15.00 (ouch).  She let me taste the rice and beans and I must say the rice and beans were very tasty.  Some places serve yellow rice (with coloring) that is tasteless--Not here.  The chunks of chicken on the taco was unseasoned and dry.  She left two of them uneaten without regrets.  
My menudo was not the best I have ever had and had that distinct \"offal\" smell which is not present at my favorite menudo place.  It was ok, I ate some of it and took the rest home to palm it off on someone else in the house.  
They charge $6.00 for a Corona which I thought was a bit high considering the location of the restaurant.  Their dinner prices are a little hefty as well.  
They don't split checks and add 18% tip for larger parties.  
I would say that if the food had been spectacular I could see myself making the trek from Scottsdale to this restaurant.  But the food is not worth the trip for me.  I travel to Baja Joe's Mexican in Gilbert which is a trip for me but it is TOTALLY worth it."}
{"text":"I am a native of the Phoenix area.  There are a lot of Mexican food restaurants but there are very few that I would call excellent.   Comedor Guadalajara is an excellent restaurant.   I have been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The Chilaquilles for breakfast are very good.   You can get them plain or with Machaca beef.   The enchilada sauce at Comeodor Guadalajara is incredible especially smothered over a red chili con carne burrito.  There is not much I can complain about at this restaurant.  The service is very good and the pricing is affordable.   If I was to make a complaint, it would be that the place gets too crowded at lunch time.   Go before 11:15 AM for lunch or you will have to wait for a seat especially on Friday.  I guess that is a good problem to have from the restarurant point of view.   I highly recoomend this place."}
{"text":"Great shrimp enchiladas! Hot and fresh. Went here on a recommendation and it is a nice little spot near south Phoenix. Not the best of neighborhoods but, a great place to get authentic Mexican dishes. I am not quite sure this would be a place I would go out of my way to eat however, it's a great option if your in the area. I know people who absolutely love the food and would definitely travel near and far to dine here but, I do not find anything special about and I've eaten here 3 or four times."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and came here by recommendation. Service and atmosphere are nothing special. Food was ok but they aren't very vegetarian friendly nor very accommodating with substitutions. I thought Arizona was suppose to have great Mexican food but this is definitely not the place for that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!

Me and my wife have been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. 

While everything is great I have fallen in love with the enchiladas (especially the green sauce) and the the cheese crisp. 

Please be aware there is almost always a long wait (30 minutes plus) but it is well with the wait. 

Also great place to take out-of-towners."}
{"text":"i absolutely loved this place! i love discovering new spots to go to with friends and this is definitely somewhere i'll be going again to in the near future. the food was incredible, and the service was amazing. definitely loved it."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever eaten. There was not 1 thing we ate that was not amazing.  If you are interested in an appetizer, get the Cheese Crisp. We got it with steak and jalapeños. it is about the size of a medium pizza.  It is good enough to eat as a meal if you are not sharing. Also the salsa that comes with the free chips is really spicy. I love spicy food and it made me grab a drink. It taste great, but dont grab a big scoop. I got the chicken burrito and the chicken was NOT soaked in that greasy seasoning like most place do. It was flavorful,  but not greasy. There is no other way to describe it beside saying it was really really good. The mango margarita is very tasty,  you can actually taste the mango flavoring. The dessert we had was the flan. I've eaten my share or flan and this is hands down the best flan I've even. It was different than any flan I've had at other restaurants. I will make sure I go out of my way to come here every time I visit. Don't like the outside fool you.  If you are coming from its back side, it looks like an run down warehouse. Once you get to front of the building it's nicer and the inside was nice and clean. So don't let the outside scare you away."}
{"text":"One of the Mexican restaurants that we have been to. The service was great and fast!!! The food was delicious and the drinks were good too!! We have no complaints! And will definitely be returning again!!"}
{"text":"red snapper dish Veracruz style. The sauce is phenomenal the fish is not farm raised you can taste the ocean. I was so happy eating here.  Found the best mexican restaurant in Phoenix"}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite Mexican food place. Get the tacos and cheese crisp with steak and jalapeños. Sooo good. It's like Mexican comfort food. Very traditional and authentic. The salsa is like pure fire and not for the weak. Be careful on Friday and Saturday nights, as it tends to have a long wait at popular times between 5 and 8 p.m. Service is always great and portions are massive. You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Wait was a bit long on a Sunday afternoon but once we were seated the food and margaritas were fantastic. You know it is a good sign when you're the only gringo in the place and it was packed.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this place for years... back when it was called 'Crystal Palace'.

We still go regularly, mostly for my dad's or mom's b-day celebration.. or with my in-laws.  One thing I've noticed throughout the years about this establishment is that they have the same waiters ... I'm talking working there for at least the 15-20 years that we've been going to this place.  That is kind of impressive, you know.

So, what to order?  Well, if your idea of a Sunday afternoon (when we usually go) is to have a nice lunch and then have a functional, productive afternoon... don't eat here!  It doesn't really matter what you order.  99% of the time what you will be served is an elliptical plate with a 24\" major diameter that is chock full of greasyass refried beans, brown (aka Mexican) rice, and some other main dish that is covered in creamy salsa, cheese, or both!  

I'm not saying it's bad (yes, it's bad for you) tasting, because it is actually quite tasty.. but, you 100% of the time regret ordering these dishes because of how you feel afterwards.  You're just bound to feel like a pig... heck, just wear your stretchy pants and one of those puffy blouses (gals, they are in style now) that way you can hide the bulge that will be your bloated belly.  Sigh... this is why I just get the fajitas these days...

The staff is mostly Spanish speaking (fine with me) and so are the patrons of the restaurant.  You'll pay a nominal price, be surrounded by lots of Mexicans, hear some typical Mexican music (hey, maybe you'll get a song from the mariachis that stalk the tables), and eat like a pi... person that has been starved and has finally been fed."}
{"text":"Friends wanted to eat here before a dbacks game...nwent inside the restaurant and it was poppin in the waiting room... It was a 45 minute wait for a table for four... Friend reassured us that it was worth it so we decided to wait... 
It was kinda cool waiting for a table because of how many people were going in and out of the restaurant and they seem to have a system all set up.. There were parties of 2, 4, 7 12 and even 14... There were a few parties that was more than 10 people....
Definitely a family friendly place!

Looked at the menu and the prices were reasonable... About 8-15 dollars a plate depending on what you order
Service was fast and friendly! 
We got the our drinks and chips and salsa (free) real quickly! The salsa was pretty spicy for me but still good!

I ordered taquitos de carne asada.. It was delicious I posted a pic.. The rice and beans were so good.. The rice has a little bit of crispyness to it.. And the meat was juicy...pico de gallo was also fresh and delicious!

Only down side is how greasy the tacos were but what Mexican food isn't greasy right? 

I can't wait to come back and try more and maybe take a huge party with me too!

Love the family atmostphere :)"}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, I was very happy to find a good Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. It was mothers day weekend so we had to wait for about 45 minutes. Fortunately, the food made up for it. I had the Chile verde burrito and my gf had the enchiladas with a side of guacamole. Everything we tried was very good. Since the portions were huge, we had leftovers for later that night. Even after microwaving it was still delicious."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand why this place is so popular. The food is not bad, but by Arizona standards I find it mediocre and uninspiring. It's an interesting vintage space, no windows, kind of like a cavernous bunker from 1974. The food tastes fresh but rather bland. The green chicken enchiladas were okay, the chilaquiles (they only have red) were like corn chips smothered in bland canned enchilada sauce with eggs, and the machaca was mediocre. I feel there are countless better places in Phoenix to have Mexican food. The service has always been friendly. There's often a wait for tables with a line out the door. The prices are rather high. Overall, along the lines of Macayos and Garcías."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.      Fantastic experience all around, including the wonderful waiter Ruben who was willing to work with my vegetarian preferences.   My husband (not a veggie) reports that the fish he ate was unbelievable.   And a half dozen mexican beers on draft.  So good!     I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Along the lines of south Phoenix Mexican restaurants, Comedor Guadalajara is one of the more authentic places out there. They've got a friendly atmosphere, inexpensive prices, and a menu encompassing both the familiar (enchilladas, braised meat dishes, etc.) to the more special dishes in Mexican fare that you don't see terribly often in Phoenix (like great chicken mole and offally good menudo). The first time I went here was with an ex-boyfriend and his parents and I played it safe because I think I was 19 and didn't know this type of Mexican cuisine too well. However, over the years, this has become a fast favorite and if you're looking for a nice place to grab a decent lunch or dinner in SoPho then this (and LoLo's) come with high recommendations."}
{"text":"What a great place friendly staff, good service and excellent food. Fresh and well prepared. The Machaca, Chilaquiles y Huevos Combo is amazing and should be a must have for breakfast."}
{"text":"We have been here about ten times for breakfast usually after hiking and still have not tried anything but the mixed machaca and chilaquilas and the steak and eggs. The one exception was a few weeks ago and I also had a small bowl of amazing posole but was unable to finish my machaca. The food is quite simply fresh, fast and flavorful. Be warned it gets busy and no matter how early you get there it has a line but it moves fast."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever!!!! Kids food came out 20 minutes before everyone elses, so they were done eating and bored. I had to get up and pour my own water because the waitress was almost nonexistent, and when she was she was debating. I visit lots of Mexican restaurants and have never been charged for chips. Oh did I mention she wrote on my child with a pen.I WILL NEVER RETURN AND DON'T RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Yum! Had the stuffed  poblano with shrimp enchiladas, the cold shrimp appetizer (like ceviche), chips & salsa, and a house margarita on the rocks and a flan to finish. All were delicious. I loved that they brought us a complimentary cup of chicken soup at the beginning that had a Posole broth flavor. The salsa was the best I've ever had-savory but with a kick. The margarita was great. The shrimp was well-cooked and there was plenty of it. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oh, I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.  R.I.L.F.

I loved you when you were also The Crystal Palace.  I loved you as a child, when we would try to sneak into the pseudo-night club side and take peeks and our moms would drag us back like trouble-making ne'er-do-wells. 

You've changed a lot since then, dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker, but your food is still as good as it always was.  You're cheap, you taste great and you give a lot, even if your looks aren't spectacular, just like my favorite hookers (what?).

The Pechuga Asada, two whole chicken breasts grilled and tender, on top of a mound of rice and beans, is so delectable and awesome that I want to eat it constantly.  But how can I, when the machaca chimichanga enchilada-style with plentiful guacamole and other assorted accoutrement beckon me?  

And what of you, Green Chili?  Your almost-soupy consistency, the potatoes, the carne, the color, the tortilla...too much to handle.  

Oh, others, they will say that it tastes the same as other Mexican restaurants to them.  That's because they haven't been spoon-fed all this shit for the past 25 years like we have, day in and day out, beaners that we are.  We can taste the slightest change in the amount of cumin, or how much salt, or the way someone cuts their meat before cooking it, or the way they make their spanish rice, because we've eaten so damned much of it. 

So that's how I know that this isn't so run-of-the-mill.  That's why I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.  

You're totally still a cutie, even at your ripe old age.  R.I.L.F:  Restaraunt I'd Like t....nevermind."}
{"text":"I recently came here for lunch with my co worker. And overall, this is a very good restaurant.

The place is huge! And seems to be very popular. 
My co worker tried their steak salad. It has nice presentation, but she said it needed more seasonings. So on a scale of 10, she rated it 7. 
On the other hand, I had their Wednesday's Special : Grilled chicken with salsa on top. It's really delicious, I finished the whole thing at once. The sauté onion was fragranced and the chicken was really tender. The beans in my opinion was good, it has a different taste...I can't really tell what it is, but together with the whole meal, it was good.

Prices are reasonable. Service was quick and friendly.

I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food! Love the spicy salsa, the meatball soup and the enchiladas. I'm a sucker for fluffy flavorful yet simple rice and I couldn't get enough of their rice!"}
{"text":"The soup they give you to start with is tasty. They only give you a hot salsa, if you're like me and need something milder then you have to ask for it. The chicken tacos are amazing! Definitely worth a try. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant that I look forward to going, the wait is long but worth it.  My favorite is the Shredded Beef Tacos,street Tacos but most of all the Beans with a extra toasted bread that you just dump into the beans...yummy... Only wish they would have chunky salsa, I don't mind the pico de gallo or their hot sauce,  but chunky salsa goes better with guacamole.and chips."}
{"text":"Hands down my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant. The food is authentic, great and plenty. My favorite is the Campechana and their Parrilladas. The drinks are good to especially the mango margarita."}
{"text":"This was very unique flavor Mexican food - we are from out of town looking for authentic Mexican food and we found it! I had the Machaca burrito which was so good and different and my husband had the red chili beef chimichanga that had amazing flavor! There was a short wait like others have said. But inside the restaurant is really big! So popular places take longer to get into...but worth it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, very busy but inside is large. I ordered a carne asada burrito. This is my staple to compare restaurants. Since it got beans and rice they charged me over $13 for the burrito. Unless u strictly stick to the lunch specials this place can become pricey.

Now if the food was great the money wouldn't matter, but it wasn't. The meat was not seasoned at all and just tasted like bland grilled meat. Much left to desire. I will have to try tacos off the lunch special menu if I returned, but I hope not to go back, unless I get out voted."}
{"text":"Amazing place with good good.  Great prices with food too match.  I really enjoyed the place and atmosphere.  The noise level is high so be prepared to enjoy the festivities."}
{"text":"First time here and had been waiting a long time to go there because every time we stop by it was closed. They do have a little bit of odd times that they're open but it's so totally worth it. When we got there we noticed that the parking lot was full and there was a parking lot attendant watching the very low lite parking lot. We did manage to find a parking spot and we got into the restaurant but we had to wait a bit because there was a line. Once we got in our Waiter got to our table properly. He pretty much just took our orders and brought our drinks. There was another guy who brought out our meals. The items that we order were absolutely delicious. If it wasn't for the size of the large plate and the Huge portions we probably would've finished our meals. Definitely worth going again and again."}
{"text":"Had cheese enchilada and chicken flauta which was so good! Best enchilada sauce i have ever had!
Waiter not at all friendly but efficient. Great food and would definitely do it again!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Sunday, and even right after it opened it was packed! Had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but it was worth it. Amazing breakfast, salsa, and coffee."}
{"text":"This was a total surprise for me. It's not often I find a really good restaurant on the road like this one. But that's one if the reasons I use YELP so much. I'm constantly on the road and constantly getting bad meals, but this place was just the opposite, had to wait about 3 minutes, got seated, got drink order in 2 min, got drink in 3 min, took order, got food in 10 min. Plate and food piping hot and tasted great. One of the few Mexican restaurants that DOESN'T load up everything with cilantro, in fact didn't see any at all... Just hate the stuff. Will definitely be back....oh yeah reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Out of town and would have driven by if not for Yelp. Food and service were awesome. We had a small wait which we were told a wait is common. definitely will come back. Spicy Shrimp tacos better then we've had before. food and plates super hot so be patient."}
{"text":"Very good for the price.  Get a serving of mild salsa if you don't like things hot.  Items on the Wednesday- Thursday \"Happy Hour\" are a good deal."}
{"text":"Comedor Guadalajara has been solid on every visit. It's located on Central and the 17 in a purplish building on the NW corner. The parking lot has security which is nice in this area. The inside is pretty large. There are two huge dining rooms. There is also quite a large staff as the place can get pretty busy. 

The food is the real standout. I've tried several things off the menu and all of them have been pretty tasty. Heres a short list of my recommendations: 
Tripas y carne fajitas - delicious 
Fried red snapper - frkn awesome 
Raw oysters - fresh and very clean 
Pico de gallo - one of my favorites in town 
Shrimp and Octopus in chipotle sauce (a la Diavolo) - mouth watering sauce. I could seriously drink it and/or swim in it. You can get it w/ just shrimp if octopus isn't your thing. 

I've had many other items that were great but cant remember them. The beans and rice are just decent. Not bad but not great. The beans are a little on the cheesy side. The price is pretty good too. They also have mariachi bands at night on the weekends. If you are looking for a wide variety of dishes and a place that can accommodate large groups, or just looking to try some outstanding Mexican food you should try out Comedor."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada it was delicious. The cheese enchiladas are delicious but a little small. The server we had was excellent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our server did a phenomenal job with serving a group of twenty people! That I know of, there were no mistakes and nothing was forgotten. Unfortunately, I don't know his name! 

Now, for the food. I got horchata to drink. Yum. It's not free refills FYI! They start you off with chips and salsa. Cool. I ordered number nine which came with a chicken enchilada, a chicken taco, a bean tostada, rice, and beans. Mediocre. Nothing worth dying for. The beans needed flavor. The rice was okay. The chicken taco and enchilada were OK. My tostada was soggy. I've had better. 

The wait for our party was 1 hour and some minutes. To sum it up, service was great, food was decent, and the appearance was a bit run down. 

P.S. I have really bad heartburn from eating here. Like, I might throw up everything I ate. 

OK I'm done."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!

There is reason for long lines, and full parking lot. the food is Amazing!!
I am a hard critic when it comes to any restaurant. This place is great in ALL areas, This place has awesome seafood, from fresh fish fillets, shrimp and more. The other fare is awesome too, from the enchiladas, burritos and everything else. You can tell they go extra mile to make sure the food is perfect, and spiced perfectly. This is my go to place for Mexican food and Seafood fare..

Comedor Guadalajara is the Real Deal!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and their food is delicious. The first time I had their shrimp tacos and tasted my friends shrimp enchiladas. I had forgotten how tasty their hot sauce is... and how it makes your mouth burn and nose run and face sweat. Yes, it is hot, but worth the burn as the flavors make you forget how hot it really is. I tried their lunch special with a taco and bean tostada and it was amazing! I also split the shrimp enchiladas and practically had to be rolled out of the place. Worth every bite! Their food is incredibly good and you can tell by the long wait times to get into this location. The service is fast efficient and friendly.

If you are really hungry, call and order takeout. The wait can be an hour long for the dining room."}
{"text":"This is the my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. I started going here at a previous job based on coworkers' recommendations, and quickly fell in love with this gem.

When you enter it's like being culturally transported to central Mexico. 

The servers are fast and attentive, and there are always specials and new items. Prices are totally fair, too.

I enjoy that you get a cup of soup with every meal, and the soup itself varies by day. I always get the enchiladas or a tostada - both are great.

You'll definitely have leftovers - and if you go here during the workday, don't plan on being super productive after eating here, you'll head to food coma alley rapidly.

For authentic, delicious food this is the place to be. Note - I think they're closed Mondays."}
{"text":"My conclusion after dining here for the first time is that hubby and I  have had all of these menu items before- and done better at other restaurants. The chips, carne asada, and carnitas were all sub-par. The rice was pretty good, however, as was the guacamole. The waiter had no clue about what type were the beers listed on the menu. The one shining star was the flan: perfectly smooth and creamy, and one of the best I've ever had. I'll be back for dessert- but ONLY for that."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here...YOU NEED TO GO. Their food is an experience that you CANNOT miss. Try it all!"}
{"text":"This is the one and only authentic Mexican restaurant (Sonoran Style) in Phoenix that compares to the great restaurants in Tucson. You can get all the classic dishes here and they all seem to be spot-on. Additionally, they also serve Mariscos (Mexican Seafood) and although I haven't tried that, I have no doubt it would be delicious as well. This is a large restaurant that has added more and more dinning space over the last 30 years and yet they still are always packed. They could build a second location, but they obviously are content to concentrate on this location. So be prepared for wait times and sometimes it's even hard to find parking. But yes, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great new find for us, we stumbled across it on a Sunday and were trying to find a place and not many were open in the area.  We saw it and all the cars 1130am Sunday and thought, why not?   Glad we did, very tasty food, good portions and really good flavor.  Some certainly authenic dishes along with the normal dishes as well!  The Mole was Que Bueno!

The \"right crowd\" was in the restaurant and knew the food had to be good and we weren't wrong.  Sure it's not in the best part of town, but don't let that scare you off of a great place!"}
{"text":"I know this is treasonous but I wasn't all that impressed.  I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  The food was very average in my opinion although the service was very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"In my last few weeks in Phoenix I tried to line up as many restaurants to try as possible, especially hoping to find some worthy Mexican food. I enjoyed my lunch at the Comedor and would gladly return.  The spot is huge; a re-purposed event ballroom I'm told. A group of four of us went one Sunday for lunch and though the space was pretty full of families, we were seated within 5 minutes. 

For lunch I ordered shrimp enchiladas which came four to a plate (corn tortillas) with rice and refried beans. Tasted great, the shrimp were cooked well, not rubbery, and the chile sauce was lightly spicy. One friend ordered the chicken mole, and I had a few bites and would highly recommend it. Admittedly the mole was not spicy enough for either of our tastes, but it was rich and complex, and the chicken was spectacular: so moist and tender, just swimming in the thick sauce. mmmmmmm! 

Reasonably priced, generous with seating, quick service and solid Mexican fare."}
{"text":"We showed up with a party of 30+ and they accommodated us fairly quickly considering. The service was great! The food was served fairly quickly as well. I ordered the ceviche and it was delicious!! I don't find myself in Phoenix often but I will definitely eat there again if I do."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Mexican Food.  This restaurant is always spotless and they have the friendliest staff there ."}
{"text":"Eh. Had high hopes for this restaurant after reading reviews, but the food was just average.  Honestly, I have had better mexican food close to home, about 2000 miles from Mexico.  That said, the staff were super friendly and it appears that this restaurant accomodates familes very well, which is great.  Wont be returning, but wish these folks all the best."}
{"text":"Very good food, very good value, very long wait at lunchtime. I had the opportunity to treat some friends who were visiting from the northeast and wanted good Mexican food. Friday lunchtime may not have been the best time to do this because of the long wait, but once we were seated, everything went very well. The waitstaff was very friendly and efficient, the food was really tasty and the servings were generous. I would say that I ate here some of the best Mexican food I've had in the Valley, and my friends were equally impressed. Lots of parking, reasonable prices -- it all adds up to a great dining experience if you don't mind the long wait for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is delish! But beware the salsa is hot hot hot just like the plates! Service was really good too! Prices seemed right on as well. I know we will be going back as it is a favorite foodery with the hubbies family!"}
{"text":"I think that Phoenix is inundated with Mexican restaurants. Generally, when you've been to one, you're been to them all. Not the case with Comedor.  We arrived here at 3 p.m. on a Saturday. There was a 20 minute wait, which people standing on the inside and the outside.  It was a nice day outside, so the wait wasn't too bad. Once at a table, I realized that the place is quiet spacious.  And the atmosphere was quiet for the amount of people that were seated. The waitress was friendly.  She was prompt with our drink orders and the chips and salsa.  My friend and I shared a hearty pot of lengua. It was just right after a late night of dancing. The prices are very reasonable. Comedor is by far, not a four or five-star facility,  but the food and service are topnotch! Keep doing what you do Comedor Guadalajara!"}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when walking into a Mexican restaurant when there is a wait (even at 11:35) and when the majority of customers waiting are Mexican. As a solo eater, I was seated within 15min. Unfortunately, I was seated at a table for four people. I apologized to my server, but he smiled and said it was ok.  He remainder attentive throughout and provided excellent service. I tipped well beyond the norm. The interior is a cross between a mid to low priced restaurant with its booths and a high school cafeteria with its plain tables and chairs in the center of the restaurant. The food was good, but not great.  I had Pollo en Mole (Chicken Mole), and was actually disappointed in the mild flavor. It was missing the richness that I usually enjoy in this meal. The beans and rice were normal for any Mexican restaurant. It was a nice touch to get a bowl of soup with my chips. I also enjoyed a large draft Negra Modelo. At $3 is was a steal. I visited one other time and had a breakfast burrito.  It was certainly more flavorful than the mole, but still it did not meet my expectations.

If I could give a half star, I would have given 3.5, instead of 4. However, the friendly wait staff and quick/inexpensive bar service give it the extra half. I will return, but I will try to skip the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Went to Comedor Guadalajara for a friend's birthday on a Friday night.  I saw they had Happy Hour deals so i went there a little early to have a drink in their bar or cantina except for they don't have one.  Bummer.  We had 7 people in our party and they don't take reservations so I put our name in ahead of time and just sat in the waiting area.  Another member of our party arrived too with the same thought I had to have a drink in the bar while waiting for the others to arrive.  The owner or manager was in the front at the hostess table and he was nice enough to let us go ahead and get seated while we waited for the rest of our party.  This was smart because my friend and I and ultimately a 3rd guest arrived and we had washed down 5 beers until the rest arrived.  You don't make money with people waiting to be seated.

We started off with appetizers of a couple of orders of cheese crisps and a side of guacamole.  wow were these good.  I totally recommend these to anybody for starters.  For dinner I ordered the Carne Asada Tampequeña.  It was Carne Asada, a cheese enchilada, rice, beans, tortillas and a side garnish of lettuce, tomatoes and guacamole.  Great meal at a great price.  i could barely finish it.  I love horchata and noticed they had it on the menu so I ordered a glass of it and it came in HUGE cup served over ice.  Tastiest horchata I've had in a long time.  For dessert I heard the Churros & Ice Cream was to die for so I tried it.  Holy hell is that good and a great idea.  if I can't have my fried ice cream, this definately ranks right up there.  The churros were hot and crispy and along with the vanilla flavored ice cream I wanted with it, I will be definitely getting that again!

I would give CG 5 stars but I have to take a star off for location.  It is in a dicey part of town but there were security guards watching the parking lot and parking when I left the restaurant at around 8 was a zoo so if you come in during prime dinner time you might have a hard time finding a spot.  While CG is very good unless I'm going to downtown for something, I probably wouldn't go back just for dinner and find something closer to me and in a better location."}
{"text":"Best REAL Mexican FOOD,..keyword,..REAL!!
Not a place w/a combo plate with some unrecognizeable Enchilada that looks like a glob of cheese still bubbling with a huge handful of Lettuce on top w/ sour cream on the side,..that is NOT Mex Food!
This place has the best Seafood, Liver and Onions, Carne Asada, Menudo. Packed on SUN's. Great atmosphere, great Food and Real Mex Food!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great tasting authentic Mexican place. The food and service is great and fast. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"There was a long wait but it went pretty fast! My daughter ordered a shredded beef chimichanga with rice and beans and I ordered a combination plate with a taco and chicken enchilada. The rice and beans were excellent and the chips served were hot and tasty. The taco and enchilada were just ok nothing exceptional or beyond the regular drive through taco shop. The meat in my daughters chimichanga was very burnt to the point most of it could not be eaten and the service was just alright as well. The manager offered no resolution for the burnt food. Given the quality of the food this place is way overpriced. We likely won't return as it just didn't live up to the hype! Lastly, the waitress lost my debit card ! Very unsatisfied"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets for Mexican food in Arizona! I love the traditional feel of the restaurant (although not in the best neighborhood but not to worry they always have security on site to watch your cars while you eat lol) The food here is amazing, the past two times I have been there I have ordered the ground beef and potato tacos and the green chile stew, both are delicious. I have also tried the enchiladas and the albondigas soup which were also very tasty...If you enjoy Mexican food and are willing to drive to the area its definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  I wouldn't pick it over Carolinas or the ponchos on central though. It's good authentic mexican, it just doesn't wow me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to come as a family. Fast, HOT, and always on point. I've never had a bad meal here. I think I can say That for my whole family. We visit this place at LEAST four times a month. They have funny hours, so if u are in doubt, make sure you call before heading out to be safe. Enjoy! You will be glad that you went!!"}
{"text":"Soooo good!!! Lunch is CRAZY busy, not enough staff to keep up. Food is authentic and priced very well. Salsa is excellent. Soup is a bit strange but part of the stop. Must go."}
{"text":"In a town with an astronomical number of options for Mexican cuisine, its hard to stand out.  The one thing that stands out about Comedor (at least to me), is the sheer scale of their operation.  Huge parking lot, huge waiting area, huge restaurant, huge menu, you get the idea.  I've been told that depending on your arrival time, the wait can be epic.  On a Saturday at lunch, I came here with a friend and the wait was a pretty benign 10 minutes.  Once seated, I pretty much settled into a familiar groove as the menu, the service, and the flavors all reminded me of local Mexican establishments I'd frequented for years.

We were actually seated all the way in the back room.  Took us about three left turns to get there, but even the back room was packed.  That said, the place wasn't crazy noisy.  Very casual, comfortable atmosphere inside.  Our server was on her A game the whole meal as she was friendly, fast, and accommodating.  I had asked my friend what (if anything) was the signature dish of the house, but she couldn't really point to any one thing so I decided to go for a combo plate this go around.  Since this is a Sonoran Mexican food establishment, I figured a collection of familiar Sonoran favorites would be a appropriate.  Combination Plate #1 contains a cheese enchilada, beef taco, bean tostada, rice and beans.  For $9, I figured that would be a good way to peer into Comedor's own house take on these familiar staples.

Food came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered.  The food was good, though you could be forgiven for thinking you were eating the exact same food with the exact same taste as other local Mexican establishments.  I suppose that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're like me and enjoy food at said establishments, but my friend was correct that none of the items really exceed any other place I've been.  My favorite item was the beef taco and it reminds me of one I've had at La Piñata.  The enchilada was also good and it reminded me of one I've had at Macayo's.  The beans and rice were also good and reminded me of those I've had at Mejico Cocina.  So all in all, the food was tasty and familiar, but you can absolutely find these staples at various Mexican establishments throughout the valley.  The big difference here is just a matter of scale.

Total cost for the combo plate, glass of water, tax and tip came to about $12.  The entire menu is pretty inexpensive (which likely explains the huge crowds here) and there's plenty of variety on the menu to choose from.  Next time I come here I'll probably give the seafood menu a try (though it'll probably remind me a lot of Mariscos Playa Hermosa).  So three stars for the food as it was good even though the cuisine didn't stand out too much from other similar valley establishments.  Four stars for the ambiance and atmosphere as the environment is super comfortable, family friendly and the restaurant is well kept inside and out.  And five stars for the service as they did a great job getting us seating pretty quickly despite the crowds, the server was excellent, and I had no trouble getting a parking spot at their huge lot.  So yeah, four stars is probably about right.  A good value for people of pretty much any means, only super-sized."}
{"text":"Pacifico on tap! This place is great! They keep it real and the food is great! Kinda old inside but worth going there to eat for sure."}
{"text":"Great food. Very authentic with a nice,comfortable atmosphere that my family has been enjoying for many years!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley!  Line is always out the door and it's very clean inside and out.  Everything is good Especially the green chili!

Bring cash though."}
{"text":"I was a bit nervous about the area at first, but it really seems to be ok in the lot.

There was a wait, a good sign for lunch at a place this size (its really a huge restaurant).  Wait was short though.  Service wasnt super speedy but not excessively long.   

Not the food, we got Tacos, enchiladas, and chille rellenos.  (Spelling sorry). It was EXCELLENT!!   Some of the best I've eaten of this type. Even the beans and rice was great!!  The salsa was to die for.  Its the hot type and it did have a kick to it but not over powering. It would have been nice to not get all broken chips from the bottom of the batch though. Both basket fulls were all broken. 

They have two dinning rooms, if your in for a quiet meal, ask for the front one as the back was quite loud.   

I cant quite give it a 5 but the food certainly was."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time and am yet to be disappointed. Enchilladas are authentic and flavorful. I drink the green chili sauce and salsa straight. Funkiest decor I've seen in awhile."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine took me to breakfast here. I ordered the Machaca breakfast plate, this is the best Mex breakfast I have had in years and I am Latino....it made me want to SLAP MY MOMMA! Nice atmosphere, great service, good pricing, instant freeway access. You got to love this place."}
{"text":"Close to 5 stars however the service was a bit off, however, we were there for lunch and it was very busy 40 minute wait. The chips were good, house hot sauce good but when I asked for more they brought me Tapatio  my friend (5 Star Chef) ordered ceviche. Elegantly served, huge portion and very good! I had the very simple taco, tostada, rice & beans. Very good. Refrito frijoles were creamy with shredded cheese, rice was (almost) perfectly cooked. Taco and the tostado were correct. I ordered a draft and got a huge mug with a lime. This is a good Mexican Food restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 10 years for good quality Mexican food and that is what I get all of the time.. The service is great and the chips and salsa spicy and amazing. Def going back for more when I am craving homemade Mexican food the way my nana makes it!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and food at this place. I like to order the menudo when I go in the weekends and they have great servers as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service here, we love the food and the ambiance. Ever since the first time we came here and met Ruben we always ask for him, his engaging smile and personality are an additional treat to a fine dinner and great margaritas. Best meals? Carnitas,  Green Chile and the Ground Beef and Potato tacos and on those special occasions when it is on the menu the Barbacoa is killer."}
{"text":"A little bit of Mexico in Phoenix with all the  tastes and sounds.  A lot of fun.

We came here early one evening and had very little wait time.  All the food is freshly prepared and given the mix of clientele of Anglos and Latinos, everyone was enjoying a great meal.  We'll be back.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The real deal.  And talk about a large establishment... they can feed an army battalion!  (And still, there is often a wait!).  All said, great people.  Great service.  Great food.  I love having you in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is friendly and prompt. I always have a bowl of the shrimp ceviche as an appetizer. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It can get very busy at times, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I liked the carne asada cheese crisp and ceviche a lot. I ordered the carne asada chimichanga enchilada style (meaning they put some sauce on top). I thought the sauce was good, but the meat itself was only ok. I was generally satisfied with my meal though. The service was very nice. Also, the portions are huuuuuge, so come hungry or be prepared to take some food home afterward."}
{"text":"had the beef/potato chile verde was soooo good and the refried beans too! service was great and this with a very full house! will come back again:"}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican food not like other places where they put a bunch of cheese & sour cream and call it Mexican food. I personally love the green chile shrimp enchiladas.The place is spacious and can hold a large parties. I don't think they accept reservations so on holidays be prepared to wait about 40-50 minutes."}
{"text":"authentic mexican sit down food..10x better than a garcias or a macayos. be carefull of going on a sat or sunday morning...20 to 30 minute wait for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food in the Phoenix area.  Large portions and great service.  Highly recommend you will be pleased."}
{"text":"So one of the BEST places in my town!!! 
Good customer service, the wait is kind of long but well worth it!! 
This mexican food was BEAUTIFUL!"}
{"text":"Its a bit expensive but me and my cousin comes all the time and thats because one of our other cousins works there! Foods really good the rice is my fave and my daughter usually eats beans and i get a carne asada  burrito enchilada style"}
{"text":"Their food is not that good but their customer service is great. I hate long waits on lunch time. I had their camarones empanizados and they were not good at all."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast a couple times and I like it :). The salsa that comes with their chips is spicy :). Finally a place with a salsa that is spicy enough !!!  There is another good Mexican place nearby called Caroline but that's mostly a take out place that u want to order and pick up.  This place is more of a sit down restaurant with great service and good food.  It's only drawback is it's pretty obscure and in a bad part of town, otherwise definitely worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"Fun!

This place is huge.  The service was good.  Happy Hour prices are good.  The food was just okay.  Salsa is spicy.  Enchilada and taco were nothing special.  My son enjoyed eating the shrimp cocktail.  Margarita was yummy and strong."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last week after receiving a tip to check it out for authentic Mexican food.  The parking lot was full, so that was a good sign.  We were warmly greeted and immediately seated.  Beware...the salsa is homemade and seriously spicy - very tasty, but dangerously hot.  We both tried enchilada combo plates and they were quite tasty.  The shredded beef taco was not our favorite, but the rice, beans and enchiladas made up for it.  Definitely a go to for authentic, tasty Mexican food!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!  DISHONEST!!!!!  The food is good the customer service and honesty HORRIBLE!  We ordered a large order for my son's graduation party and was quoted $269. Perfect. We show up an hour before the party to get the food and the price is $429!!!  What?!!  \"Sorry ma'am do you want it or not?\"  We were told we \"must have been misquoted by Maria who took the order.\"  We had NO choice but to take it since guests were arriving in less than an hour. I called back SEVERAL times to rectify this mistake and was either told someone would call me back (it NEVER happened) or they would hang up on me! Yes hang up. I was told that's what we do when we get busy. We just hang up the phone because we can't answer it. Really?!!  I finally reached Terry, and she wanted to get off the phone quickly but I refused to let her hang up until it was resolved and the end result was \"Sorry...we don't do refunds here....you should have known what the price was.\"  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  MARIA TOLD me what the price was and it almost DOUBLED upon pick up. By the way when Terry decided she had enough of the phone conversation she just hung up. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!!!!!  Unreal!  LEARN CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE!!"}
{"text":"Went there for a family breakfast on a Sunday, really packed but it's because the place is super good, we mostly had menudo and it was excellent, chips and salsa were really good as well, second time there my first time I had the parillada and it was also really good! This place had the reviews and just adding one more if you love Mexican food you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix hands down! This place is one of my weekly lunch go to's. They have great lunch combination specials and every person gets soup to start. The hot sauce is hot hot hot, but so delicious! It gets pretty busy during the week for lunch, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes if you are going during peak times."}
{"text":"all and all not a bad place...   Like the other reviews... it does not win points for decor... but what it lacks here it more than makes up for in service... i go here for lunch from time to time and they always seems to be quick... i really like it when they serve you chips and salsa and they bring out some sort of mexican soup...

the food is good... i like the shredded beef tacos and the burros are typical south side... HUGE with alot of good stuff in them... while this is not my favorite place in the area... it is still pretty good and is pretty authintic..."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this restaurant by a friend. A little off the beaten path so not something you would drive by everyday. The average wait time at any time of the day is 20-30 minutes so be prepared. Wait is not a big deal and totally worth it.

Great lunch specials that are inexpensive and taste delicious! Their rice is also super good!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  A bit of a wait but there is a reason.   Best Mexican food in Phoenix.  Lived in Mexico for a year and live in Seattle.  This was my first stop off the airplane when I came to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've spent much time in and eaten all over Mexico.  So there, I got that out of the way.

As a gringo, I like this restaurant.  I'd put it in the same category as Garcia's, Macayo's, On the Border, or Cantina Laredo.  That is, it's Mexican-American food - saucey, cheesy, and spicy with a flour tortilla and a margarita on top.  It's just the type of food most gringos think of when we think of Mexican food.

On the other hand, if you're a Defeño you'll probably roll your eyes at this food and hope that we gringos don't really think ALL Mexican food is this stereotypical.

For a beverage, try the Jamaica - it's mellow and fruity just like the Defeños like it.  Then for dessert, try the Plantains with Vanilla Ice Cream - it's syrupy-sweet just like the gringos like it."}
{"text":"There's a reason that this restaurant has a full wait, and it is well worth it to tough it out if you find yourself at the end of that line. The staff are extremely nice, very patient, and very positive. The food is excellent, with highest regards given to the guacamole, the Machaca, and the enchiladas. Great portion sizes, large variety of appetizers, and a hefty seafood selection."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the 70's - Best Mexican food in the valley!  The lines are long at times, but totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a Ajo, AZ quality Mexican restaurant, which is better than 5 stars. The beans and tortillas are the first measure of a Mexican restaurant, these are great.  Second do they have a good beef, chicken offering to make their dishes with, check,  Do they have good menudo only on the weekend or if they have the rest of the week do they make everyday? Yes indeed on the weekend option.  Do they use the term burros instead of the California/Texas burrito marketing term - ok on this non-food related item they turned to the dark side.  Do they have mole that makes me happy - yes for sure.  Do they have Bohemia beer - yes.  They hit all the marks plus they do them all well.  Oh yeah - love their tacos."}
{"text":"The food is so bland and tasteless. There are better Mexican food places up the street. I just don't understand why it's so popular when the food is horrible."}
{"text":"First off the food here is good but there's so much more to a review than just a restaurants food in my opinion. Everything seems fine as a costumer but back in the kitchen and after hours it's a completely different picture. The owner has got to be the rudest human I've ever came across. I was sitting with my friend waiting for breakfast when I hear a young man (employee) asking the owner if he can go home early since he had just came back from surgery. This woman yelled at him telling him that he must stay or he would lose his job. I couldn't believe what I was hearing this poor guys face look blue and his voice was shaking my heart was breaking for him. For a moment I thought I was on the show what would you do since this situation was just so inhuman. The worse part was when I went to the restroom I saw another co worker found the young man on the floor crying with pain. I suggested he reported his horrible woman but he had his reasons as to why he was afraid to do so. In the end we left in disgust and angry at what we had witnessed. Later I mentioned this experience to others and some stated they had relatives or friends that have worked there in the past and let me tell you if I thought my story was bad their experiences blew my mind. I will never go back and give this women a cent of my hard earned money. I hope more people start speaking up about this place and not be afraid of getting laid off. I hope this helps some of you when choosing your next new restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent menudo. I took my dad for Father's Day breakfast. It was my first time there, his second. We had a long wait, and from what I hear, that's pretty common there. Very worth the wait, though. We both had been craving menudo and ordered some along with an entree. I ordered the small bowl which was considered large at many other restaurants, and it did not disappoint. Delicious menudo! I also got the chilaquiles; Dad had chorizo. Both were tasty, filling, and well done."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at the suggestion of a coworker. My tip... go early! I felt sorry for the crowds of people waiting at 12:15 for a table. This place is pretty packed, so it must be doing well. I had a lunch special that had a tostada and a cheese enchilada. We were served soup with our chips and salsa, but I am not a soup fan so I passed on that one. The chips were ok, I have definitely had worse. The bowl is pretty small so they have to refill a ton if you eat a lot of chips. The food was good, not amazing but I would go back if I were asked to."}
{"text":"One word: YUUUUUUUUM! And that's not coming from me! That's coming from my very Mexican mother who says there are no good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix! (She says she doesn't get the whole cheddar cheese on Mexican plates. Haha!) But she is happy to report that she will come here over and over again! And can we highly recommend the Caldo de Res on the weekends. Again, YUUUUUUM!"}
{"text":"Dining Guadalajara was more like eating in Guadalajara, complete with a wait for a table despite having many opens ones and a questionable security guard at the front door.

We were in a cave like room waiting for our table, luckily it was just a 5 minute wait for lunch.

One inside the main dining hall we were able to see the large size of this place, tables finished wall decorates but a unfinished ceilings and no windows make up the inside.

I oped for the chillies relleno off the lunch special menu $7.50  most of the lunch specials range from 7.25 to 8.50.

From seating to our main course we had over 5 different people visit our table.

The chips were nothing special bu I do like the the spicy and thin salsa here.

My chillie rellno was a bit different, the sauce was a bland tomato based sauce, the chillie it self could have used a bit more roasting and the cheese seemed a bit thin.

Overall the prices seemed high for the location, and quality of food, I would sooner go to la canasa."}
{"text":"Always passed it,but finally stopped,worth it,super traditional sonoran dishes, good service,cold beer,I got the #6 a chicken flauta and taco,the flauta was basically a big rolled taco,I was hoping for the real deal,the did have the best salsa versa I ever had,and im not lying,served hot.go there."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for a couple years and a friend finally recommended it to me. I actually hadn't really paid attention to the signage and I thought maybe it was a Spanish nightclub because of the entrance in the rear, the parking attendant and you can't really tell anyone is there if you are only looking from the I-17 frontage road. Well, don't let looks deceive you. This place is great!

I've had Chilaquiles y Huevos, Machaca Con Huevos, Steak and Chicken Picado and some tacos. Everything has been delicious. The service has been great, even during the lunch rush. The portions are generous and the prices are appropriate.

Definitely stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food. It's authentic Mexican food not that pseudo mexican food catered towards gringos like some places.  Restaurant was cool looking with nice decor. The chips are served fresh and hot with tasty salsa. The chicken enchiladas will change your life. The chile relleno is great too. The churro ice cream desert is A1.  Price is very reasonable. It came to 34$ for 2 with dessert.  The horchata was tasty too."}
{"text":"Mucho Bueno!! Good food from a Mexican-American who is critical of all Mexican food except Mi Madre's. Plentiful on portions and service is top-notch. Menudo and the tripitias are as close to perfect. I do miss the live music, but the price they asked for was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Wow. Have traveled all over the country, experiencing the local cuisines in each city I visited.  The food here was the best mexican I have ever had, bar none.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been here three times and it never disappoints. Tons on the menu but I have always ordered the Chile Releno and Chicken Enchilada. Chips are great and the salsa has a big bite. There is a reason the parking lot is always full at lunch time!"}
{"text":"Great enchiladas, beans, and rice. Packed for lunch so plan ahead. Consistently good."}
{"text":"Every time I have gone there the service has been horrible. The only thing that kept me going back was that it is authentic Mexican food. But this last time the food was horrible and the service was the worst I've ever experienced. It was enough for me and my family to never go back"}
{"text":"This is my #1 favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley.  I've tried almost all of them.  Other than some incredible Mexican restaurants in Mexico, this is about as close as you're going to get (in my opinion).  

I've eaten my way through the menu, but my favorite is still their chili rellenos.  Salsa is incredible.  Great margaritas, as well."}
{"text":"Went with my family here, and we all enjoyed it. The food is prepared fresh and tastes great. Not exactly sure why it's not five star. There was just something... off. Perhaps the ambiance?  It's definitely worth visiting though, and there would be nothing stopping me from going back."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. The rice and beans alone are so good. Food always comes out hot which is super important to me. Only suggestion would be to offer a not so spicy salsa in addition to there spicy one. Get the machaca beef or caldo! You won't be disapointed"}
{"text":"Ever since my wife and I first went here a couple of months ago, I've almost constantly craved the soups they serve. We've been back 5-6 times since then and can't get enough of anything they serve. Even the rice and beans are outstanding!.

The weekend only beef soup is probably my favorite but can only order on the weekends. The chicken soup is so rich and flavorful, I doubt I can ever truly enjoy anyone else's and the 7 mares seafood soup, well, that's in a class all it's own....hell, all of their soups are in a class all their own. One big downfall though, after eating here you're ready to collapse into a food coma....in a good way.

Everything we've tried has been outstanding except the carne asada. The carne was a bit thin and way over cooked. The pork carnitas were very good but a little overcooked also. However, all fish/seafood and chicken dishes have been amazing and have found Comedor Guadalajara definitely the most authentic Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area. I've tried most of the Mexican Restaurants and this has been the best overall. The typical 30-60 minute average wait during dining high times should give you a clue but look at who's eating here, families. Groups of 8-15+ in a party let alone us couples and smaller parties. When large families gather at a restaurant, you know it's got to be good!

Overall, pricing is very reasonable, and definitely an excellent value for the portion sizes offered. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from here. The food was GREAT but I wish I had ordered-in. Next time I'll have to come in and sit down--it's just that nice inside; kinda made me feel like I was in someone's home. ALSO, don't let the front of the building intimidate you. Just step on inside"}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ, stopped here during the week for lunch. Enchilada special was good. Complementary cup of soup as an appetizer was a nice touch. The salsa is hot so you might request mild for less heat. Plan to return."}
{"text":"So good! AMAZING food and the waitress was very attentive. The rest of the staff was super friendly. Really, the food was just amazing. The portions were huge...enough for more than 2 meals. It's always packed when we drive by, but we got there at 4pm and were seated immediately."}
{"text":"It's so, so mexican food. My husband loves it- I think it's a bit greasy. La Canasta on 7th St is way, way better. The salsa they put on the table is a little too hot for my taste as well."}
{"text":"Food was decent nothing to brag about,  we had a party of multiple people,   I did not appreciate that they refused to  split the ticket for us, after they promised to do so,  And because of that I give them one start,  if I could I give them 1/2 star. Poor service!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat. Food has always been perfect, HOT and excellent. Service has been top notch! My only gripe is that they are so busy, there is always a 20-40 minute wait to get in. But the wait is worth it :) They need to open more locations :)"}
{"text":"This is our second time here and both times have been good. They have an extensive selection of seafood dishes right alongside the expected carne asada and enchiladas. I had chile rellenos both trips. They \"stuff\" shrimp rellenos and enchiladas by topping them with the protein. They tastes great. 

And they have fried plantains!"}
{"text":"Their beans are amazing and have been for the 20 years we've been eating here. The carne asada tacos are delicious, the guacamole luscious, the machaca and the chiliquilas plate is fabulous. Love their rice and their enchilada sauce. They have done a great job unifying the decor recently. The service is fast and always consistent. Oh, and if you go for lunch, they usually serve soup before the meal and it is yummy!! They do a great job with large parties too. Terry, one of the owners is always so welcoming."}
{"text":"4.5 Star 
This place teeters between a 4.5-5 Star. The food is DELICIOUS! The service isn't consistent. Some servers take time and are fun and friendly. Others are just robots, taking orders and pushing you out as quickly as possible. Be prepared to wait but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place, so was excited when I finally got to eat here.  Sadly, I was not impressed.  The salsa was mediocre, and my chimi was soggy and tasteless. The beans were tasteless as well. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"A wonderful family restaurant in South Phoenix located on the corner of S. Central Avenue and I-17, this place has the BEST Mexican breakfast on the weekend since the old Matador closed on 1st St.  I always go for their chilaquiles.  A generous serving of homemade red sauce over corn tortilla chips and topped with two over easy eggs, this is a dish that can easily be split with a friend.  And the mariachis only add to this place's ambiance!  You won't be disappointed--the real deal!"}
{"text":"BOMB breakfast! We must have arrived at the perfect time because when we left there were people waiting on tables and chairs outside.

Great service and everything was authentic!"}
{"text":"Very authentic mexican food, I have been coming here with my family since I was a small child. Now, I have a family of my own and although the food and portions have changed a bit, I especially like the weekend breakfast specials. I love their chilaquiles and chimichangas, BUT the music is atrocious. That is the only reason why I only give it 4 stars, I am glad the music volume is on low because otherwise I might not be able to stand it. It is just so random and awkward at times, anything from old spanish pop songs to mexican drug corridos. 
Sanchez family: please come up with another source of music selection (perhaps Pandora or satelite radio or even the radio), heck I'd much rather have NO MUSIC than this. Thank you"}
{"text":"Great local authentic Mexican food! Brought a couple out-of-towners to this place and said that it was amazing, and they definitely agreed. An easy way to tell that a Mexican food restaurant is going to be good is by their beans, rice, and tortillas. All 3 were awesome. Long waits in line, but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Ones of the best in town. First come first serve basis. No reservations but the wait is worth it! No matter how you like you're Mexican food they do it well! So good for dinner! Great friendly service and most are bi lingual! I haven't had any trouble with heavy accents or hard understandings!"}
{"text":"The one and only place we go for Mexican when we fly into Sky Harbor with an appetite. Any time you roll into a Mexican restaurant and there is a line at 10:30 AM on a Saturday or Sunday should tell you something. All the Phoenix Mexican classics like chimis, burros, enchiladas, etc. are spot on but they take it to the next level with a huge menu of authentic Mexican seafood offerings. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Only based off the Menudo on a Sunday afternoon. The tripe and hominy needed to be cooked longer."}
{"text":"Being from out of town and getting in from an early flight. This was an awesome place for late breakfast and early lunch!"}
{"text":"This is an authentic south Phoenix barrio restaurant. White folks in the dining room are in a pitiful minority, which is always a sign of good ethnic cuisine. As others have mentioned the decor is not necessarily hip, nor is the grand dining area particularly cozy, but I still liked the atmosphere. 

Affirming its authentic barrio status, when the waitress approached my nonwhite but also non-Hispanic self, she greeted us with \"Buenos tardes. Como estan?\" Having just returned from vacation in Argentina where I grew accustomed to these greetings despite my inability to speak Spanish, I quickly responded, \"Buenos tardes, bien gracias.\" In Buenos Aires I was quickly identified by most waiters as a tourist so the conversation would then continue in English. Back here in my own hometown of Phoenix it's a slightly different story. Confusion reigned after I got out my Spanish response. She asked me something. I looked at her puzzled and instead of saying simply, \"I don't speak Spanish\" I reflexively said, \"Como?\" which of course extended the linguistic chaos at our table, because she then repeated herself and naturally I repeated my look of confusion. She probably wanted to smack me by the time we figured out what was going on. She was gracious though. 

The food was superb. I ordered something I'd never tried before: machaca con huevos. My mouth waters at the very thought of it. For the unacquainted, machaca is basically shredded beef. It was mixed up with egg, onions, tomatoes, and peppers, and came with a side of beans and rice. My friend had a more standard plate of cheese enchiladas and a tostada, and she also gave it the thumbs up.

The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere, though criticized elsewhere for its decor, was actually pretty interesting to me mainly because of my fellow customers. There were some large families there, from all walks of life. 

I'm definitely going back, especially since I live close by."}
{"text":"Fantastic classic Mexican food! Would definitely recommend for breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food, great service, and fair prices! Our server was Francisco. Food was brought out in a timely manner. :-) I ordered the 2 shredded beef tacos with rice and beans. Yummm!"}
{"text":"Over Rated and to crowded.  Go to Mi Patio or La Canasta instead.  Or, go a little further north to Via Delosantos for even better food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I think the service was good ,don't get the hype about the food seems like some home cooked food with extra salt . don't get me wrong was still good just not worth the drive from goodyear like allot of my friends say .."}
{"text":"Never have I had a bad meal there. You will probably have a 30-45 minute wait, but it's well worth it.  If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, look no further."}
{"text":"Great food! The rice and beans are amazing but the enchiladas were a little dry for me. We also had the menudo which was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Very good! I have never had a complaint and always look forward to eating here! Customer service is always great and for how good the food is the prices are low if you ask me."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, but come before the lunch rush or the wait WILL be long. The soup at lunch time will remind you of the soup mom and abuelita made. Had the camarones a la veracruzana and was the best I had in a long time.  Great dinning area and service is great."}
{"text":"Love this place! My Family and I always come here after church on Sundays. The restaurant is clean, the servers are friendly, the manager ALWAYS makes sure your needs were satisfied. I always order the chicken nachos with horchata. Never had a problem with the food."}
{"text":"I have been here once. Thank you Genny C. 

I had the chilaquiles y huevos ($7.95: cut up corn tortillas smothered in red chile and cheese and topped with eggs - i suggest over medium). A huge fan of huevos rancheros, I had never had chilaquiles (or heard of them) before this visit.  They took hold of me! I dream of them now. I wake longing for them. I wish they were served past 10:30. 

As for the restaurant: the place is ginormous! Don't let the security guards in the parking lot put you off. Instead, let them get the door for you and take comfort in a delicious meal served by friendly staff who will greet you in Spanish but just as easily will answer you in English."}
{"text":"It's one of the best Mexican food restaraunts in the valley. Their tacos de carne asada are tough to beat. You will be happy!"}
{"text":"While driving here, you may decide that rather than get shot, head to a different restaurant.  When you arrive, there is a valet who is there to make sure that the locals don't break into your car.  Once inside, the experience becomes wonderful.  I loved that 90% of the clientele are Mexican.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time and there were families as well as people dating or friends just having dinner together.  The quality of the food was very high.  I wouldn't say it was innovative but it was yummy.  Additionally all the waiters and staff at the restaurant were genuine and friendly.

If you don't mind the uneasiness of the area, give this one a try--it's authentic."}
{"text":"What can I say about Comedor that hasn't already been said... The food is reasonably priced and the selection is huge. Back in the day before I started telecommuting, a margarita or beer paired with one of their daily specials have gotten me through more than one long assed afternoon at work (please don't tell my boss).

The wait staff is incredibly nice and watching newbies squint under the bright lights and bad south of the boarder art is always entertaining.

If you want to be a little bold, try one of their soups. They are scarrier than shit if you are a white girl that grew up on meat and potatoes, but they taste great (I just don't ask whats in it). LOL"}
{"text":"One of the best original Mexican food places in Arizona. They have great food and good service.  One of the best chilli relleno in town."}
{"text":"Food was pretty generic for the price nothing to go crazy about but the whole room was dimly lit which for me is a plus. Sever was exceptional. We didn't have to wait long for food nor drinks. I had the shrimp enchiladas and my husband the ceviche. Like I said a bit over priced for that food however the guacamole was delicious would go again for a family event not for a Friday night date."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to Guadalajara for about 20 years now....Im 23. I remember my entire family would com here to eat all the time. I use to order the nuggets when i was a kid, lol. But seriously every since i can remember the food has always been authentic and delicious. The service has always been great too. They accommodate to large parties as well. Make sure you get here early on the weekends tho, It get SUPER BUSY and will most likely have to wait for a table. But trust me, you want to wait. Over the years this place got more and more popular and has gone through alot of extensions and renovations but has always remained the same as far as the food goes. I remember they use to have live mariachis coming table to table asking if they would like a song. They were great as well, but i can see why they arent there anymore. Alot of business people come here now since its downtown but This place is hands down my favorite and only Mexican restaurant i eat at, and ive been Mexican my entire life. Trust me. EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars, but They been open for years now you think they would have a better system on there wait times. Food is amazing best Micheladas in town."}
{"text":"Besides the long wait and mediocre waiters the food was incredibly tasteful and fresh. We had the 'pescado y camaron veracruz' and alone the plate with the main dish was huge! Rice & beans on the side of course.

The seafood juice was well heated and the shrimps were large and food proportioned. The desert was to die for if you order the 'churro with ice cream' your mouth will water."}
{"text":"Ever just want excellent Mexican food for your party, just like Mama used to make but without the days of preparation and cooking?  We ordered from Comedor's catering menu:  green chicken enchiladas, chicken flautas (substitution of their tacos) and rice for our Halloween party.  Surprisingly, Comedor also included a quart size of guacamole, salsa, sour cream and two big bags of tortilla chips.  Prices were extremely reasonable and the food was amazing!  I'm not a big green chili fan but I am now!  Chunks of fresh green chili on the enchiladas and boy, were the enchiladas plump full of chicken!  

I've decided that I'll never slave over a kitchen stove to prep for a party or get together.  El Comedor's catering menu saved me tons of time and headache AND it was extremely affordable.  I got to enjoy our party and everyone couldn't say enough great things about the food!"}
{"text":"Setting the mood.... South Phoenix just received a nice cleaning by the way of a quick downpour of rain last weekend. It was awesome. We decided a good Mexican meal was the celebration for rain in AZ. 

Saturday evening right at dinner time. The place was busy but we were in and seated after a 15min wait. The building sits a ton of people. 

We ordered the Green Chili Beef Chimi. The chimi, rice and beans were  the perfect size to split. The green chili  had a great flavor, enough beef etc. The rice was good but the standout was the beans. Man they were good. 

The chips and salsa are ok. I like my salsa a little chunky but it had good flavor. 

The prices seem reasonable and the staff was ok. We will be back."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Outfield - Your Love)

Mexican food in Phoenix is far away
Come sometimes and try it over
So many things that I want to eat
You know I like my tacos little bit spicy
Let's go to Comedor Guadalajara tonight!
Let's go to Comedor Guadalajara tonight!

Comedor Guadalajara is one of those sketchy looking places that borderlines danger and well maybe a little adventure wouldn't hurt!

Needless to say, from the outside the location of this place is pretty off beat (Ghetto!) in my books.  The inside is totally different.  Family friendly and staff is pretty up beat and on the ball.  I came here with my family and we ordered a bunch for Happy Hour!  I went for the sampler appetizer platter and the Mole Chicken Enchiladas with a Modelo beer.  The appetizer came with mini shredded beef tacos on a crispy shell, frijoles, mini cheese crisp, and guacamole.  Overall, a nice start, the platter was perfect for sharing for 2 and a great combination with a beer.  The Mole chicken was steaming hot and came with refried beans and rice.  It was thick and creamy with a minor hint of cocoa which was perfect!  

Overall, service was top notch.  The food was very good for Phoenix Mexican cuisine.  I can't say it's the best in town cause it's a give or take thing.  In the end, what makes Mexican food for me is the sauce and salsa.  Comedor Guadalajara delivers on the food part, but the sauces really makes the difference on my palates! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Found this place in Best of Phoenix list in the New Times. BEST OF is right on! We got there at about 11:30 on a Saturday and there was a 30 minute wait which was no big deal. Our server was very kind and cheerful, and the food was AMAZING. My husband loved the chips and salsa - definitely spicy which is great. He had a combo of an enchilada and a red chile beef burrito. The big chunks of beef inside were so tender and flavorful!  I had a combo with a cheese enchilada, bean tostada and beef taco. The sauce on the enchilada was fantastic as was the rest of the meal. The rice is super flavorful and the beans are delicious as well. I loved everything about this place for sure. Highly recommend and I will be back over and over."}
{"text":"Delicioso! Oh and the Margaritas are delicious...I should know, it's my middle name!  But really, the food here is quite authentic.  The chips and salsa are very sabrosos!  The serving size is substantial and enough to take home leftovers.  I prefer their green chile (again, I'm from New Mexico and very picky about my Mexican food!).
I had a combination plate with enchiladas and tacos (if a place can't pull these two simple dishes off...this chica from NM is gonna go elsewhere) and they were both delicious.

Everyone at my table really enjoyed their food.  

I can't wait to go back and try the albondigas soup which I've heard so much about.  I hear they also have a pretty good happy hour. 

Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"I really love this place, I didn't realize how big it was. You could have a large group for a party. The parking is actually pretty genius since it's off the freeway it gets congested do to avoid that when you leave, they have you exit out the back to avoid car accidents. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good Mexican food, it is spicy but very delicious"}
{"text":"Chicken chinichanga and chips and guacamole. Big portions you won't leave here hungry amazing food great service"}
{"text":"Guadalajara is one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in Phx. Portions large to share or take home; everything on the menu is delicious. You will not be disappointed.  The restaurant is spacious;  however on week-ends expect to wait inside or outside for a table."}
{"text":"I LOVE,  LOVE, LOVE, their food! Authentic and savory. A must for those who love REAL Mexican food.! :)

The only thing that keeps this restaurant from getting 5 stars is the location and atmosphere. Service is good and food is great so if you don't mind those 2 things than definitely try this place if you haven't already. :)"}
{"text":"This place was beyond busy. The lobby was packed like sardines, but outside water was offered and there is a seating area. The carnitas are amazing and a generous portion. The flautas were a bit dry and not the best choice. However, the menu is very intriguing and obviously a local favorite just based off the amount of people lined up waiting to get in."}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican food I have had In the 17 years I've  been in AZ !  Great location ! Can't wait to try The rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"We asked a local where to eat good Mexican food and they sent us here. I have no idea why. There was a huge line out the door at 7pm on a Sunday, also no idea why.  The food was what you would get at any restaurant from here to Oregon... nothing special. It was OK. When our bill came everything was more than it said on the menu. Just ordinary Mexican food with no substitutions, nothing innovative, not much thought to the sauces, no vegetables. Nice server, but overpriced and under wowed, by far. I'm a lightweight drinker and had a margarita, which was 10., on an empty stomach and didn't feel a thing. Lots of terrific, innovative food in this town so won't go here again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years!  The food is always good and authentic. If you come on a weekend, be prepared to wait awhile but if you have the time...stay it will be worth it. Order anyone of the parilla platters, chimis, machaca..they're all delicious!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this AUTHENTIC Mexican food. My family has tried just about everything on the menu. The wait time to get a table is the only issue as the lines are always out the door just to get a table because it's so GOOD. However once you get a table you have the most delicious chips and salsa to munch on. For dessert try the Flan you gotta order 2 because one isn't enough 
Horchata is made from scratch and my kids love it. 

This place is a must if your ever hungry on the south side!!"}
{"text":"I'm so full. The food is so good. Sleep, I must sleep. Slight wait at 2:00 on a Saturday. Not the best margarita that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Omg Great, I had the shrimp ench. with Chz Relleno.  Excellent"}
{"text":"This place is great!!
I have been here several times with friends,  family,  alone, dates, lunch for the office.
The food is delish and the prices is right.
I especislly love love the shrimp cocktail the best !! I do hate the wait  though, it ridiculous how long you have to wait, especially when they have the back of the restaurant they can use or come around and take drunk ordets to make the wait seem less. I do wish thet had chunky salsa instead of just the red  hot stuff  but oh well.
All in all thumbs up !"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my faves and have never had a bad dish here. It's a must try and a great place to bring your family and friends to."}
{"text":"Mexican food is funny because it's one cuisine that we tend to have so many favorites in that we need to make sub-categories. As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. 

If I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. 

Service is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish."}
{"text":"I was here for Breakfast Club. I have heard for years I really need to go here.  Well, my friends were right.  The food and service were really good and I had to leave early so I gave my cash to another Yelper and consequently did not have to deal with the cluster of paying in a large party with one check.  I had grilled chicken breast with eggs and beans.  The chicken was topped with a red sauce, grilled onions and some mild jalapenos.  The parking has gotten so bad they make employees park off the property so some have quit after several break ins to their cars.  In the evenings they have security but only in the lot. They have supposedly bought the property to the North and applied to expand the building and add parking.  Talking to long time Hispanic residents, the building was once a dance venue with live bands. The biggest hangups about this place are parking and getting seated.  It is not uncommon to wait almost an hour including weekday lunch times."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here several times and I have to say that the food is consistently top notch, and the service is always excellent.  I drive several miles across town to eat here frequently. Definitely. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Comedor Guadalajara was the place picked for May's breakfast club, let's just get the eh parts out of the way 1st, They do not take any reservations (so I was told) but they do have plenty of seating but you have to wait until at least ¾ of your party is there before being seating.  2nd, they do no split the checks and they said only a max of 5 cards per check, so if you are coming with a party, make sure to bring cash, and take in to account that tip & tax is per everyone in the party, not just what you order. The bill was sort of a cluster, but we got through it.

I came for breakfast, but when I heard what my son was ordering dangit I wanted it too, plate envy right off the bat. I ordered the machaca chimichanga with verde sauce. It was shredded beef, eggs, jalapenos, onions & tomatoes, I figured even though it was on the regular menu and not breakfast, the fact that it had egg in it made it ok. 

The burrito was delish, the meat was tender and juicy the jalapenos fresh and vivid in color, the verde sauce was so good! Before I knew it the burrito was gone! It did come with a side of rice & beans as well.  Another great meal at Comedor Guadalajara, and fun time with the breakfast club!"}
{"text":"There's no better way to undo a 3 mile morning walk than to end up stuffing your face at the Comedor.  This place is muy grande and could be the perfect spot for a very very large dinner party. The parking lot is huge and is tended by courteous security guards who welcome you in at the door. The menu is extensive and offers some unusual items such as Chicharrone (pork rind) and Nopales (cactus) dishes along with an interesting   Caldo de Mariscos (Seafood Soup). Great if you're looking for some food adventure! Que suave~

I started my post walk lunch with a cold Pacifico that came with a large frosty mug. Man that beer went down good!  The chips were delivered warm with a side of chili tepin style salsa.  For starters, we ordered the Frijoles con Chorizo dip. I'm not huge fan of chorizo but really enjoyed this dip. The chorizo was mild (not greasy at all) and was served with oven toasted chips topped with melted cheese. We shared a plate of the Chili Verde con Papas which is a rich green chili sauce with chunks of beef, potatoes, and onions served with refried pinto beans and tortilla. For our other dish, we had the Chilaquiles Y Huevos. This dish was the main reason we went to Comedor and it didn't disappoint.  This was layered corn tortillas soaking in a red chili sauce and topped with two over medium eggs and served with a side of frijoles and warm tortilla. The only problem I ran into was eating way more then I should have. It must be a good sign if you waddle out of the place whining and holding your gut.

I'll be heading back very soon to try the Nopalito dish and the Pescado Entero Tilapia; Pan Freed \"whole\" Tilapia. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time and wasn't expecting a whole lot after looking at the outside.  I figured it would be good though because we went there for my bosses birthday and I know he has the money to find good food.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the inside nice and roomy.  No overcrowding and it was clean.  
The food was great, I had the machaca beef chimichaunga enchilada style.  The serving was enough to feed me for two meals and I only added a little bit of salt, the flavoring was excellent."}
{"text":"Coming from California I was very pleasantly surprised to find a gem of a Mexican restaurant!!!! Chili verde con papas is delish and the garlic shrimp plate yummy!!!!!! Will come again while visiting Phoenix"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a minute and I must say they are moving on up! Lol Anyway, food is still good but I have a minor issue..the chips & salsa.  1st one is complimentary the 2nd they start charging, like WTH that's why I come here for, now I gotta savor every chip and the little salsa they give us!  We're Mexicans who eats 3 chips & 1/4  cup salsa that they provide?!?!  PONCHOS, HERE WE COME!!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Authentic Mexican food at its best.  I highly recommend the fajitas. Good service, quality, quantity and prices.  1st time there.  Definitely will be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place was the worst!  9 of us from work went to celebrate April birthday's.  We waited for 40 minutes for a table and when we were taken to it there were 5 tables in the same section that were empty and stayed empty for the 2 hours we were there. When we left, there were still about 25 people waiting to be seated. WHY??? 

I ordered the chicken salad and it couldn't have been more disappointing.  The chicken had a fish taste, the 20 cucumber slices were dry and old looking and the 2 lime slices were so old they were turning brown; the lettuce was the same lettuce they use for garnish on every other dish.  The tomatoes' were almost a puree. Yep that's all that was on this salad from a Mexican restaurant....No pinto beans, no cheese, no guacamole...NOTHING!

Only 1 person at our table ate all of their food and only 1 person asked for a to go box.  We were all very excited to try this place because we've heard so many good things about it.  We've taken this place off of our celebration lunch list.

The staff were all very friendly and the place was clean.  Best part of our experience."}
{"text":"Popular place as it's crowded by 5 pm on a Saturday night.  We had to wait 20 minutes. Food is good, but not great. Potions are very large, which might explain the crowds. 

Highlight was the ceviche as it was fresh and flavorful.  Pass on the raw oysters as they lacked flavor and they didn't come with any special sauce.

The rice and beans were bland, but the large grilled flour tortilla was very good. 

The fajitas for two and more looked very good. 

The place is not nice inside and doesn't have any charm.... Feels like being in a large warehouse without character."}
{"text":"AWESOME. 

And sometimes when it's really busy, they take you to magical rooms of the building that you don't even know exist for extra seating. 

But really everything is good here."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best overall Mexican restaurant in The Valley. By overall I mean they have excellent family style food and your run of the mill Mexican favorite's, tacos, enchiladas and such. 

Great hot sauce and the best tacos I have ever had in the 10 years I have lived here. Love the family style seafood dinner as well. Great and friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"We came here and it wasn't busy, but since they have 3 waiting areas I'm assuming they get super busy. Our waiter started off amazing, and kinda drifted off by the end of our mea which was a bummer. The food was amazing and I cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"I did not know that this gem of a restaurant was so close to where we live.  I am so glad my parents told me about this place.  First off, they have the BEST green sauce I have ever had.  Seriously. So good.

Went here for dinner one evening, and we had to wait about 5 minutes, no biggie, the place was busy.  We were seated and our waiter brought over the most delicious chips and salsa.  I have a soft spot in my heart for salty homemade chips, and they definitely delivered.  The salsa was a bit too spicy for my taste, but the smidgen that I had of it was quite tasty. The hubs was practically drinking it out of the bowl even though it was a hair spicy for him as well.

I ordered the enchilada with beef and green sauce.  Came with the usual rice and beans.  Hubs got the same I think.  I'll say it again, best green sauce ever.  I devoured as much as I possibly could, but I do not have a second stomach, so the other half of it was coming home with me.

We've come back several times since, and each time is as good if not seemingly better than the last!"}
{"text":"I'm Mexican so I am very particular about my Mexican food, it has to be better than I can cook it for me to pay for it- or I have to be hung over... Either way, this place is the best, I come here just for the tripas but everything is delicious and the salsa is hot! it gets packed so be prepared to wait on the weekends..."}
{"text":"Not where you might expect to find a great restaurant, I found it because I was having my car repaired next door!
Been there twice now -
Cheese Enchilada Huevos for breakfast, Chicken Enchilada and Chile Rellenos for lunch, they have Negra Modelo on tap too!
Excellent food, great service, will be going back many times"}
{"text":"Shared a number 3 combo. Awesome taco! Good enchilada sauce! Excellent green chile! Salsa is a bit too spicy for me.
Well worth the 20 minute wait! Really enjoyed it :)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food in the Metro Phoenix area. Beef tacos and chili rellenos never fail.

Staff is friendly and funny."}
{"text":"Comedor Guadalajara is very open with soft lighting. It is a big restaurant, It will be easy to get lost in it. I went on Thursday October 27, 2017 at 1:00 PM. There was a brief wait for a seat. When seated the waitress brought a small bowl of soup before we ordered anything. We had to ask for chips, and the three of us got two small bowls. We were not charged for them or the second bowl of salsa. 
The food arrived promptly. I paid $8.25 for a Chili Relleno, white rice and beans. The Chili was very large, but when I went to eat it, water pressed out from it. It tasted good, but the cheese was not warm enough to be smooth. Salsa only came one way: hot. It was a good thing because the chili really needed it. If you order a taco with shredded beef, they will charge you extra for it. The standard taco comes with ground beef and potato. 
Comedor Guadalajara does not have TV's or loud background music. The parking lot is large, but it was nearly full at lunchtime. The two star rating could mean I missed something."}
{"text":"I am reviewing Guadalajara's after eating here for the third time. I'm from out of town and my father-in-law turned me on to this place. It was one of his favorites. The food here never disappoints. You can taste the passion in every bite; especially in the salsa which is just the right amount of hot and blowing up with flavor. My only regret is that it was too early in the day to enjoy one of their tasty margaritas. I guess we will need to go back soon."}
{"text":"Meal was very good, ordered albondigas medium size, the bowl was wide with a big brim and like an inch deep, so not that much soup at all, picture on menu shows a side of rice and beans but only comes w/ rice so idk if that's for the large bowl but just an fyi. Chips could have been better and salsa. The service was great and quick didn't have to wait long about 15 min for myself, friend and her daughter, food came out pretty quick. There's no tamales! That's what I originally wanted and was sad when I was told they don't serve them. The soup was really good though."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. Fajitas are delicious and come with plenty of food to feed 4-6 people. Not to fond of the rice and beans here. They do not taste authentic to me. The chile relleno is not good. The poblanos are not roasted. It seems like they just stuff the raw chili with cheese and fry in the batter. You cant even cut it with your fork cause its so tough. The red sauce on the chile relleno tastes like they pour it right out of a can. It has no authentic taste to it at all. The cheese used on the cheese crisp is not good either. Its a mixed cheese and always comes out burned and too crispy. I do love the Micheladas at this place which is why we usually come anyway. This place is ALWAYS packed and you ALWAYS have to wait at least 15-20 mins."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Service is good and friendly! But not sure if it was worth 45 min of waiting! Try pechuga asada!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had the green chile shrimp enchiladas which came with rice and beans and it was really good. My boyfriend had the carne asada chopped steak. And my sister had the shrimp cocktail. All were very verg good."}
{"text":"Big place, sitting isn't a problem, big crowd; polite and attentive for the most part. Food: From 1-10, I'd give it a 5 in flavor and authenticity. Price: Kind of up there, I'd say it's overpriced for what you really get; average $20 per person if you include tip. Not a bad place, but not the best either, give it a try and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Love this place. We eat here once a week. 
We always go home satisfy and feel like you had a good meal for the right price. 

Stay away from rush hours like lunch time. 
But it's worth the wait..."}
{"text":"my husband and I were driving by this place the other day and not knowing anything about it decided we would give it a try. 
I was pleased with the food. I got a bit of food envy when my husband's dish was way yummier than what I ordered. 
I got the tacos with beef and potatoes combination. I forget the exact name of the dish my husband ordered, but it was sort of a shrimp burrito dish. It had plenty of shrimp in it and was very tasty. My tacos were good, but I was disappointed at the amount of potatoes in it. I was hoping for a layer of potatoes and a layer of beef, but what they do is mix bits of potato with the beef. It was still good. 

Their chips and salsa are decent. The salsa for me gets a bit too spicy after a while. 

I would definitley go again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I came from out of state to visit ASU and i knew i wanted some good mexican food! I found this place on yelp and this was hands down the best mexican food I've ever had!!!! Highly recommend the cheese crisp!"}
{"text":"We came here after a DBacks game and it was PACKED! It didn't take long for them to seat us which was nice that they were able to turn tables over like no ones business. The waitress was very helpful and took our orders right away. The chips and salsa were just okay. The chips were a little stale and over salted. I orders the tacos which I did not know were fried. They were super greasy and the beef was very dry. I did however love the way the beans tasted. 

The price for the food was very decent and I will go back based on other reviews. I feel like this was just a fluke experience."}
{"text":"Good , authentic mexican.

Had the 3 carne-asada street style tacos plate with rice and beans. Very generous portions and could not even finish my food. Meat was tender and hot off the grill. Added guac, pico, lettuce and lemon squeezed over the whole thing, simple delicious. They beans and Spanish rice are some of the best I've had anywhere, ever. They also have negro modelo on tap. Overall very solid and would eat here again, good service, nice non-tourist trap atmosphere."}
{"text":"yum! this place is yummy! it is my favorite authentic mexican restaurant to take out-of-towners to. the doorman/security guard is so sweet and makes sure you don't get shot and that your car is there after your meal. the surrounding area is a bit tough, and i don't suggest wandering far from the parking lot if you know what i mean. the somewhat scary location makes everything a bit more authentic in my eyes.

i made the mistake of ordering chicken once, and i was disappointed. not sure why ... maybe it is because they don't use all white meat chicken. or maybe it was an off day. or maybe i just don't like their chicken. i don't know. but now i stick with beef or cheese based items and everything i get is super delish. love the beans! they do 'em right. margaritas are freshly made and full of alcohol, not like the watered down versions you get from a stupid machine at other places. gotta love the free chips and salsa ... the salsa always tastes fresh, and they'll give you a super-spicy version if you ask. and they keep 'em coming, even after dinner if you want more.  try the carne asada cheese crisp as an appetizer ... it is huge, but so good that if you have more than 4 people at your table you should order two. if you don't someone's going to wish they had gotten more."}
{"text":"Love it..great spot for breakfast.  Not a lot of good Mexican breakfast spot that I know of but this place is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 5 stars. This is how homemade Mexican food is suppose to taste like. My mom told me about this place and ever since then we go there every time there's a special occasion. We would go every weekend if this place was a lil closer than home. I always order their shredded beef enchilada plate that includes bean and rice. Absolutely amazing. The sauce was the perfect hint of spicy to it. The meat was fresh as well. Bean and rice is my favorite. Also! This place has a great price for how much food you get. It's delicious and I will recommend anyone there for Mexican food. Love it!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here since I was a baby and the food is just as good if not better. I have my own family now and we will continue to come here and hopefully as my family grows they will also love this restaurant!!! Love this place!!! People are nice and friendly food is absolutely amazing and authentic!"}
{"text":"Recommended from a friend so that I could take family for some good  Mexican food. They were not disappointed and we happened to go at happy hour.
We started with mango margaritas for $4,00 Yum.
Taco and enchilada happy hour plate. Chicken flauta combo plate. Carnitas fried juicy pork loin which comes out on a hot iron skillet,absolutely delicious.
All plates served with great beans, then the rice. Carnita dish also comes with choice of tortillas and a little guacamole and pico. We enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"We come here especially for the excellent service.  The Albondigas is the BEST we've ever had!  This place is a MUST visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything was amazing...beans, rice, shredded beef tacos, cheese enchiladas, shrimp enchiladas, tostadas, margaritas, shrimp cocktails, salsa,  chips, customer service, wait staff.. Everything was great. Absolutely no complaints. First time here for my husband and he already wants to come back!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! Fresh and so flavorful.  I love the communal seating and openness inside.  Chips and salsa were great.  My enchilada plate was creamy and flavorful! I tried my first chulata here!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food - great service. They can take large groups or just a few for lunch dinner. Bummer they close on Mondays - always come here when I get to town. When the local Univision station took me here for lunch - it's got to be good."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food. I got the chicken chili enchiladas and highly recommend! Place can get packed for lunch so come early."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix. We are from Southern California and don't have such great tasting and authentic food near us.  Located near baseball arena downtown right off the freeway.  Prices are great.    Mango margaritas were delicious.  Tons of food selections.  We visit this gem every time we venture to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had heard lots of favorable things from friends.  Food was just okay, except soup and beans--they were very good.
Waited almost an hour to be seated
Then waited another 40 minutes to be served.
Then waited 20 minutes for a to go box and still have not received our check.  Server was having a prolonged discussion with another diner over the price of his beer.  Somewhat pg a disappointment.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.  Never had a bad meal.  Their rice is so good that I have to stop myself from eating it before I balloon into one huge rice ball.  The enchiladas make my heart sing.  The salsa is super spicy and AH-MAZING."}
{"text":"I've been to Comedor Guadalajara several time and it's one of 3 Mexican restaurants that I will go spend my money at. Service was good as always but what made me give it a three star rating is because we saw now that they charge for ordering a second bowl of chips and salsa (from what I know that didn't happen before) and because we order the mini nachos which were not nachos at all! They were 4 tostadas de frijoles with cheese and tomatoes sprinkled on top. My boyfriend asked if we could get the jalapeños on the side because he doesn't like jalapeños but I do. Our server then proceeded to tell us that if we order the jalapeños on the side they would charge us extra because they would see it as a side instead of us just having it on the side of the plate so we just asked to remove the jalapeños as a whole so we wouldn't get charged extra. I have attached a picture of the \"mini nacho\" AKA tostada de frijoles."}
{"text":"great find on the way home, I wish they had one in San Diego!!!

(4) Parrilla De Tres Carnes: Delish, we split the meal for 2 between 3 people and still had leftovers
(4) Margaritas: great mix not too sweet and just a hint of tequila to know it's in there"}
{"text":"To the point- this place served me some of the best Mexican I have ever had. 

I actually want to go back and take away one star from every review I've given. It was that good.

Soup- best I have ever had
Carne asada- juicy perfectly cooked
Eggs- omg perfect
Beans-delicious, they're beans...
Salsa - really good

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gracias Monica for bringing the International Supper Club here!

From the outside, like Monica said, youre not really sure what youre getting into. Until you get inside and smell the deliciousness.

This place is a bit smaller than I expected, but spacious at the same time. We were seated (smartly) towards the back of the restaurant. Oh the menu. Its a little overwhelming, not in the amount of options but the amount of things that sound delicious! I chose the Chimichanga de Pollo. I was totally prepared to enjoy it, as is but then our waitress suggested that I get it enchilada style. Best. Waitress. Ever. Holy god was that thing good. The chicken was tender, the sauce was so so good, and it had just the right amount of spice. Its a large dish, that was equally good the next day.

I would highly recommend this place for a sit down meal if youre looking for really good, authentic mexican food. And I wish I was still in AZ cuz writing this review has made me hungry for it!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Authentic Mexican Food this is your place.

Don't judge this place from the exterior view, once you get inside it is well lit, well air conditioned and great space. 

The service was great, quick, efficient and genuine.  

The salsa and pico were amazing, the best in town.  I had the chicken chimi with red sauce and rice and beans.  It was perfect! Couldn't beat it! perfect flavors and perfect spice.  

Great value for priced paid as well.  They have great lunch special and better happy hour specials.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Our \"Dine Around\" group came here for dinner.  We started off with shrimp ceviche.  Talk about flavor and great tasting food.  I would highly recommend this dish.  For me, I opted for the chimichanga, enchilada style.  It was ok...my only negative, was the fact that, there were pieces of egg shell.  I would suggest that if you cook with eggs, make sure you are cautious & mindful of that.  Aside from that, it was very well seasoned and presented nicely.  As for service, unfortunately, that was only ok, as well.  Had to ask 2x for more salsa.  And one of the menus we received had salsa on the inside pages, the hostesses, really could use the spare time to make sure they stay wiped down between uses.  Again, the food is worth  coming for and the service issues are minor."}
{"text":"Food is nicely prepared. Service is offered with a smile. If in the neighborhood I would stop by.  Definitely better than average!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best machaca chimichanga I have ever had the pleasure of eating in this fine state of Arizona."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix! Always a go to when we visit! Great food, great service, great environment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get Mexican food in the valley. Being an Arizona native, I am pretty picky when it comes to good quality Mexican food and this place fits the bill.  Not overly expensive and I can get all my favorite basic Mexican comfort foods like cheese enchiladas, albondigas, and shredded beef tacos.  Nothing fancy- just good Mexican food done right.  The salsa is actually spicy too, which is a big bonus in my book."}
{"text":"I love this Guadalajara because I feel like their food is more authentic than any other restaurant in Phoenix. The service is wonderful and the atmosphere is great. It used to be half dance club, but they renovated and it is huge! This is my go to Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"My mom raved and raved about this restaurant and finally brought me for a family dinner out and it was everything she claimed and more! I ordered the carne asada soft tacos. The most impressive thing was not only the flavors but the fact that there was not a single piece of fat on the meat. Trimmed and seasoned beautifully. Everything else was just as delicious, rice beans, guac. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I had the Chile Verde con Papas. Fantastic. I recommend you try it. The Margaritas were awesome also."}
{"text":"This place is literally the shiznit. For any occasion,  I would come here. The portions are out of this world, not overpriced, and unlimited chips and salsa. Holla! (It's good salsa too, not the lame stuff). 

This place has been here for a while and I hope it never goes. Google their open hours before you decide to go though! Their hours change from day to day. 

I couldn't even recommend anything, because everything is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab some food before a ball game. Just minutes from the stadiums in downtown. The old purple artistic wall that could be seen from the freeway as you passed by is gone now but he great food is still inside. 

Unlike many of the horrible Mexican places in south Phoenix this one is by far one of the best. There is a reason why they have a huge parking lot, great food brings a lot of people. For all of you who are afraid to venture into this part of town, have no fear there is security in the parking lot. 

Check this places out! The horchata is made fresh and is delish!"}
{"text":"Comedor Guadalajara! Over the past few years I have been to several Mexican restaurants. I'm new to Phoenix. I was quite impressed with the excellent service I received. My server Ruben was very pleasant and positive to work with. He provided OUTSTANDING customer service. The atmosphere was laid back. Good environment for singles, couples, and groups. The food is EXCELLENT. You can taste the freshness, quality and spices in the food. Price is very affordable. VERY impressed. Highly recommended! Keep up the hard work!"}
{"text":"This place was yummy and fun for big groups. Came here for a yelp gathering. Our server was awseome & food was delicious. However, they dont take reservations & they wouldnt really split checks which made it hard for our large group. Spent just as much time eating as we did tryi g to pay our bill. Ughhh..."}
{"text":"Good food and great building. Had the Red Chili Beef Burrito. Red chili was not so flavorful, beef was tender and juicy. Great salsa and chips. The lack of great Mexican food in Phoenix is reflected in peoples reviews. Not a four star and no way a five star mexican joint. Growing up in Santa Barbara a place like Comedor is the norm. Would go again if in the area."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am always pleased. I usually either have the cheese enchilada plate or the shredded beef tacos. The food is great and the servers are always cordial and attentive. By far, this is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Every time I order take out from here it's not on time. I decided not to tip when picking up take out because why should I when it's late. A female staff member came up and looked at my receipt, went to the back and grabbed my food. Instead of handing it to me she puts it under the counter and says absolutely nothing to the man running the take out counter. He finally realizes it after 15 minutes and tries to hand it to me and I question why they didn't say anything to me and just let my food sit there and get cold. I didn't want them taking it out on my food because many members of their staff are rude. I'm done giving them my money. Bad customer service, horrible smelling bathrooms, and no care for their customers will eventually hurt them. I won't recommend them any more either."}
{"text":"This is the BEST mexican food in Phoenix! There is always a wait for a good reason and they sit you really fast. The staff is so nice and accommodating. But their food... out of this world! I always get their carne asada burrito (ALWAYS GET THE RED ENCHILADA SAUCE...best $2 you'll ever spend). Today my mom got the liver and it was amazing. Also... unlimited horchata...no extra charge. Life is made. Come here for the best mexican food in Phoenix, no matter how far the drive,  it's worth it."}
{"text":"After one of my epic party adventures down town... My buddy said this place was a must for great breakfast food. We entered the spot it was packed we were seated pretty fast and I looked over the menu and went with the  Machaca, Chilaquiles y Huevos Combo with a tall Dos Equis it was early but a must have... I rate the experience as followed.

Machaca, Chilaquiles y Huevos Combo - A
Staff - A

I enjoyed my meal it was so good... I will be back for sure soon for some great food everyone was so nice my second beer ended up on the table talking with your hands can be a problem...The staff laughed and helped me clean it up now that's team work."}
{"text":"Among the worst Mexican food I've ever experienced. I ordered one of their specialties, the chicken/steak combo ($15), at the suggestion of the waiter. The steak was extremely thin. The result was a dry, tough, tasteless, cardboardish piece of beef. The chicken was better, but still dry and lacking flavor. The rest of the dish was average.

Service was fine. I just don't see how this place is rated so generously on Yelp. Perhaps there's some monkey business going on with these ratings?"}
{"text":"It ain't the prettiest place but if you want a true Mexican meal this is the place to go. 
We make it must stop every time we're in the Phoenix area. Great service, large portions, served hot and quick. Delicious!  What more can you ask for? A Marquita, big and cold."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the valley for good authentic Mexican food.  I have never met an enchilada that I liked as much as the ones at Comedor! The food is consistently good. Great place to bring the out of towners who want Mexican food."}
{"text":"At the risk of making this place any more popular and having my wait time increase...

This place is awesome 

I love Mexican food in general but u feel (usually) Mexican food is very similar in quality no matter where you go, sure there's a few bad places, but in general it's always about the same.

This place is AWESOME!! The food is always delicious the menu is a bit more unique than other places I've been and the service is always good,

The only issue is the wait, there is always a wait.

This is the only restaurant I can think of where I routinely go back and every third time go some place else because the wait is too long

I would say 30-45 min is worth it most of the time but 1 hour might be too long and certainly 1 hour 20 is way too long.

Very very good place,great food good service"}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night and requested a table for two and there was a 15 minute wait but it was well worth it.  The menu is varied and large, the staff are prompt, friendly, and available.  We ordered margaritas and beers as well as the Fundido Chorizo.  The chips came with melted cheese on them and they were thicker than the chips and salsa chips so they stood up to the hot cheese.  A restaurant that thinks of these things deserves some serious props!  

Dinner came and the portion sizes are huge!  I had the best chile relleno I have ever had in my life!  The ratio of egg batter, pepper, cheese, and sauce all complimented each other and none of it got soggy so it was enjoyable the entire time.  I am impressed Comedor and will be back!"}
{"text":"If you love grandma's authentic Mexican food. Then this is the place for you. I one of the pickiest eaters when it comes to Mexican restaurants, but Comedor Guadalajara is the real deal! 

I had the ceviche and it was AMAZING. My girlfriend had the cheese enchiladas with red sauce and raved about it for days. The only downside is that you only get ONE bowl of chips and then have to pay for the next one. Don't like that? Think again! The restaurant is trying to minimize food waste which is a note-worthy in my book. 

Overall, the service is friendly, prompt and respectful. This is my first Yelp review and I could not have picked a better place to start with. I totally recommend visiting soon, there might be a wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Sunday eats for my family! Been here once before with some of public safety personnel being that I work in Emergency Management...we waited for 40min but it was worth the wait, our waiter was nice and helpful refilled our drinks when needed, he did mix Pepsi and Dr. Pepper together for the mrs. which we didn't bother to let him know due to the cups being huge and I ordered green chili sauce for my chimichanga not red but I got red but it was an honest mistake and one I'm not fussing over cause the red chili was on point. The kids enjoyed their taco plates and the cheese crisp for the appetizer. All in all we enjoyed ourselves and we were full for he rest of the day, their are so many items to chose from on their menu so we will be sure to be back soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant holds a special place in my heart. Our abuelos intruduced us to the food here at a very young age. Even though the prices have gone up since then and they charge for certain things seems outrageous it is well worth it. I have never had a bad plate here. The one thing I don't like, is sometimes when you have a large party it seems like they try to rush you through your meal. 

But the food here really is delicious. The service is fast and friendly. It does help if you speak spanish as this is authentic Mexican spot. They do, however, have some American food on the kids menu. Haha. My kid....

We have had a lot of big brunches here for birthday's and such and they have a room in the back to accommodate. Sometimes they have a live Trio walking around singing classics. Always some Vicente playing over the speakers. 

This place is a warm and fuzzy for me. Love it."}
{"text":"This place is in a questionable part of town.  The exterior and interior are simply decorated.  A little effort would be nice.

Our server was friendly,quick and attentive.

The chips and salsa are good.  The salsa has a nice touch of spice to it.  I could always use more, but it is hotter than most places.

We ordered a cheese crisp to start.  It is essentially a super thin pizza crust with a ton of cheese meleted over it.  I love thin crust pizza, and I love cheese even more, but it could use some seasoning or some kind of sauce.

For my meal I ordered the cheese enchilada lunch special.  The enchiladas were ok.  The sauce was very good.  The rice was ok."}
{"text":"ok, so I've been back to this place oh 3 or 4 more times. I love this place! The food is excellent and you can tell by how busy they are that they are obviously doing something right.

I recommend the chicken nachos as an appaitizer. I don't know how they make their chicken so flavorful, but it's amazing. It's like charbroilled or grilled, so tasty. The nachos are basically 4 or 5 tostada's cut in half.  You get a layer of beans, topped with jalapeno's, cheese and chicken. A side of guacamole and sour cream come with this plate.

The chicken chimi enchilada style with the red sauce is beyond words. It's the same chicken used in the nachos. I basically lick the plate clean. 

I have also tried the shrimp enchiladas - too shrimp tasting for my taste, but my sister -in-law, who's big into seafood really enjoyed them. Comes with a lot of shrimp.

The carne asada tacos - were fantastic.

If you want really well done Mexican food don't waste your money anywhere else. Just come here. The wait staff is excellent and attentive."}
{"text":"I was taken to this place after landing in Phoenix, by a friend that lives locally. I was told it was one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area. I can't tell about others in the area but I can speak on this one. It was a darn good choice. 

The wait to eat was about 20 minutes and staff were friendly. Once we were seated, we were helped by a kind fellow named \"Israel\". He answered all questions and always came to the table with a smile. This I greatly appreciated. 

I ordered the machaca. This was my first time eating this so I don't know where it compares to others but it was absolutely amazing. The taste of the steak, eggs, jalapeno, onions, and tomatoes created a beautiful collaboration that danced upon my tastebuds for the evening. The horchata was very good, as it always should be.

If I should return to Phoenix, this is definitely on my hit list."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise A true diamond in the rough for wholesome, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Awful greasy Mexican food; margaritas from mix; no decor

Don't understand what restaurant the other reviewers went to."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Love the sopa they give before the meal. Service is good, staff is usually friendly.  Very busy during lunch and after work hours.  Be prepared to wait. Clean establishment with clean restrooms. One lot is dirt/gravel for overflow.  Food pricing is good."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed thier food here.  Went with another family and got Parrillada De Tres Carnes.  I highly recommend- its now my favorite Mexican Restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"I struck up an offer with my work mate about going to a great taco shop down the road for lunch but was immediately rebuffed in favor of what was billed as \"the most amazingly authentic Mexican restaurant in Phoenix\". When he told me that it was located at Central and I 17, my spidi-sense went off instantaneously. One to go with the flow (more about flow later) I yielded and we began the trek. Upon entry you garnered that the ambiance reminded you of something. Then it struck me, it was the meth lab Walter White was killed in during the season finale of Breaking Bad. After being seated, we were provided Luke warm soup which, based on the rest of the lunch, was the best part. Shortly there after we were provided chips and salsa. The chips were garden variety dipping chips. Nothing to write home to mom (or yelp) about. The salsa tasted like pool water. Not just your everyday pool water but likely what pool water tastes like after dripping off of Michael Phelps' gooch. I decided to go with the shrimp tacos for the main entree. WHOOPS. First bite I knew I was doomed. The blend of disgusting shrimp and \"spicy sauce\" made a flavor that not even Hannibal Lectur would stand for. Two tacos in, it was time for me to worship the porcelain god. Before my cheeks could hit the seat, the flow commenced. Strictly liquid, it hit the water with such force that it redirected to my sphincter. This is known as the \"poor mans bidet\" or \"the kiss of Poseidon\". After 10 minutes of sweat filled bowel movements, I returned to the table to find out my work mate had forgotten his wallet and I had to pay for this disaster in its entirety. 1/10 would not go again."}
{"text":"No. Not the one! 
After a good wait, we find out breakfast ends at 11am. On Brunch Day? I am sorry but Sunday is Brunch day and breakfast should be available till at least 2pm. Your rules.  Fair enough. 
The service: rushed: guy was so busy I felt his stress as I took my time deciding. Pleasant, but clearly busy! 

The place was clean, loud and lacked ambience and charm.
All of which I could live with, had the food been outstanding. 
If you know me, you know I can eat. I don't leave food behind especially when it comes to my comfort food like beans and rice. Both came piping hot but lacked flavor! There was no soul in this food. The Machaca looked great with fresh jalapenos and tomato but yet again lacked seasoning. Sadly, I did not mop my plate clean with the very good flour tortilla that was served with my meal. 
My husband's combo was as generic as they come. 

Over priced with too long of a wait for what is essentially generic Mexican- American food that lost it's authentic soul somewhere along the way, so I don't suspect that the Chilaquiles would have saved this review!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here today to start off my birthday festivities and I have to say that I was not disappointed. My love found this place on yelp and decided to take me here because of all the great reviews. I am so happy he did because this has become one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. It doesn't look so amazing from the outside but the inside is super cute and clean and the staff is very friendly. I had the frozen mango margarita and it was so delicious and huge...just look at the photo! The chips and salsa are great...salsa is spicy but very addicting. The complementary soup that you get with the lunch special is really good too. Now onto the main meal...both my love and I had the chicken chimichanga and wow! Not only is it huge, it's fantastic!!! I was so full but I just couldn't stop eating. Finally, the flan...if you ever come here, you have to get the flan!!!! I just couldn't resist before taking a photo...sorry! I highly recommend this place...the atmosphere, staff, drinks, and food are all fantastic!! I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Just had their food for take out and to me there's nothing authentic about it.. Had the carne asada burrito and all it was a huge tortilla with some kind of really dry beef in it and that's it.. There was barely a teaspoon of guacamole and Pico de gallo to put in my burrito that was put in a container on the side. What the heck kinda burrito is this ?? :O sorry but I was born and raised in San Diego and this is not authentic.. Maybe to ARizonians it is lol I gave them 3 stars because their red hot (tomato sauce ) salsa was pretty good and their chips were not bad. Tried many Mexican  restaurants in AZ and none compare to Cali Mexican food.. I guess my taste buds are used to high quality flavor .. I give up searching for a good mex restaurant here.. The one and only good taco shop in AZ  is Señor Taco but they are actually from San Diego so they know what authentic is. ;-D but anyways this   Place wasn't horrible for AZ standards it's pretty decent"}
{"text":"We love Guadalajara my whole family has been coming here for years we really think it's awesome that you get how soup at lunch before you order as an appetizer that's nice"}
{"text":"You have NEVER tried mexican food till you've had it here (and I've been to mexico several times)....and if your gonna come and order tacos - then just go to taco bell!

The menu is extensive, I've tried EVERYTHING from tongue to intestines and I am SOOO not \"that\" kind of eater!  Delish each and every time! The wait staff is helpful and some of them have been there for years (speaks heavily on the quality of management...they must be as good to their workers as they are to their customers). 

You will not be disappointed....if you go for breakfast, you have to try the Machaca Chiliquilies......unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Comedor Guadalajara is probably one of, if not, our favorite Mexican traditional Mexican places.  We don't usually order the regular Mexican food you can get at any place, we tend to order their specials.  Those dishes might be a little more exotic than most people are use to, but they always leave us full and delighted.  When the Mrs & I go, we often get the Tres Carnes platter or order of the specials for dinner.  When my cousin  and I go, I almost always order the Tripas de Leche......nothing better!!!!!   I have never seen them on a menu anywhere else.!  Gotta try them!"}
{"text":"WOOOOW amazing place for dinner!! this place is really good! amazing staff."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want some yummy margaritas and potato tacos!!! Yes potato tacos! Their rice are on point and there carne asada are da bomb!! The service is alway friendly, but expect to wait on a Saturday or Sunday. The parking lot is alway packed."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food place in phx!  Delicious food...great prices. ..great happy hour til 6pm...a must try and always return!"}
{"text":"Green Chile chicken enchiladas, Oysters and with the right person... perfect."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food ever! Authentic is an understatement. The alphabet soup they give you at the beginning is delicious. Prices are very reasonable so you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in Phoenix.. has to be the best in town .. will definitely recommend and continue dining here.."}
{"text":"The huaracha pechuga is so delicious. Grilled chicken, topped with salsa and cheese and it comes with a heaping plate of beans and rice. I love that they give you a little bowl of complimentary soup while you wait for your order."}
{"text":"Not authentic in the least. 
Very disappointed in the quality of the food. They dont offer a lot of the basics I'm used to back in Michigan: meat options, mixing meats with combos. Not to mention they offer hard tacos. The enchiladas were just okay. The beans were definitely from a can and the rice tastes more Chinese than Mexican.

The wait isn't worth it unless you don't know Mexican food.

Yep, this gringa is saying this isn't authentic Mexican food.
I should've run when I saw cheddar on everything (not Oaxaca), chicken nuggets for kids, and they offer flour tortillas."}
{"text":"Food was very delicious and very very hot (the plates so be careful!) I had the red beef chimichanga with beans and rice and my husband had the chicken chimichanga enchilada style and he said it was very good."}
{"text":"Everything here fresh and tasty! You have to wait no matter what time you're going but definitely worth to wait for."}
{"text":"Love their enchiladas de Camaron. Every time I come here waiters are great! There are times where you need to wait but food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix. Amazing Machaca Burrito and oysters. Chips and salsa are amazing. Just avoid the post church crowd on Sundays. Don't let the exterior and location scare you, this is an awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"My chilaquiles was slimey and the cooks gave me scrambled eggs when I asked for sunny side up eggs. The horchata was good though. Customer service was good, but slow."}
{"text":"Comedor Guadalajara in S Central is housed in a great building.  Large restaurant - absolutely beautiful - high ceilings, with a comfortable waiting area, and spacious table arrangement.  Family oriented.  They definitely cater to the Mexi brethren.  

The host guided us to the table for what seemed like the distance of an average Phoenix block and I was like, \"Oh this is still part of the restaurant?!\"  The menu is large enough for a nearsighted grandma complete with a few pictures for folk like me who are constantly asking:  what's that, how's it, who dat?  

If you're short on cash that week or forgot your wallet you can easily fill up with the sopa appetizer (a vegetable pasta soup) they bring upon seating and the obligatory corn tortilla chips.  

The chips were warm.  Mmmm.  And delicious with spicy salsa.  I also ordered some churros.  Made-to-order.  Hot hot hot and yum yum yum.  If I return to CG, it'll be with a different flock, and I would like to have a peck at one of the molcajetes or something out of the mariscos category because my own snobbish preference is for more upscale dishes.  

Word to the wise:  if you want to eat here, you best be an early bird because they're not open all day.  And prepare to wait about 20 min for a table, even at the break of lunch time.  This place is more popular than a high school jock and cheerleader couple."}
{"text":"This is an average restaurant with a cavernous feeling interior. I ordered a chicken taco, cheese enchilada lunch combo comes with cup of soup. The service is good and some chips and salsa were served up right away. The salsa was super hot even for me so couldn't eat much of it. The lunch came out and the server warned about the hot plate. The salsa was hot the rest of the meal with rice and beans was bland. I was hoping the soup might change my mind but not, it reminded me of Cambells beef and vegetable soup. Nothing inspiring here so I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Good food. The rice n beans were perfect. Chips were fresh n salsa was tasty n hot. 
I had the Chili Rellenos lunch.  Good size portion. I would return to eat here again, I will try other restaurants first."}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing great authentic mechladas. The red chile is amazing and so is the chips and salsa. Beware salsa is so good yet so hot. Its painfully good. Yum yum yum"}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for Dodger spring training and was recommended this GREAT authentic Mexican restaurant. Ate here with the boys and the food was BOMB and very generous portions.  Highly recommend and ven y disfruta una de sus mango margaritas. Will return next year."}
{"text":"Ok - this place is totally out of my world of existence...But a bunch of us had just volunteered with Packages from Home on S 7th Ave, and we were hungry, so we went here on a suggestion from the team.

Good service, fantastic huge food and reasonable cold beer and margs...we all agreed we would have never thought (or had been in the hood) to stop here without an intro, but we were very satisfied with Guadalajara!  Try this place if you are in the area - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their green chicken enchiladas are outstanding, as are their chiles rellenos and tongue tacos. Not a fan of their grilled meat platters, as it seemed over cooked and under seasoned. But oh, those enchiladas... WOW!"}
{"text":"Nice to finally meet you Comedor Guadalajara,

My husband and I really enjoyed our time here.  We were looking for decent Mexican food.  This was our first visit . . . the parking lot (behind the building) was large (and don't let the outside of the building defer you . . . it's big inside).  The service was great from the minute we walked in the door.  The margaritas were really good (you could actually taste the tequila).  Complimentary warm chips and spicy salsa.  We both had the beef tacos, rice and beans.  Great food.

This is going to be our new go-to place when we crave Mexican food.  Prices were very reasonable.

I can't wait to go back for breakfast and try the Huevos Rancheros.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Not the best part of town but they do have security in the parking lot.  Food is pretty decent Mexican food.  Chips and salsa suck but the desserts like the flan are to die for.  The place is huge inside. Service is generally pretty good. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mexican restaurant in South Phoenix. The food is always hot and fresh, and the salsa is to die for! This restaurant is a legend for my family, and I.  I can remember coming to this place when I was 9 or 10 years old, and I am now 30 years old. This place is great and law enforcement/fire fighter friendly which is a plus in my book. For breakfast, I recommend the chilaquiles, and machaca
 Lunch and dinner I like to eat the shredded beef tacos, shrimp soup, green Chile chicken enchiladas etc. Everything is really delicious."}
{"text":"Came here after reading all the good yelp reviews and now I can see why. Here you can get legit yummy comfort food mexican plates just like a mama would make (not that i am Mexican), but it is just that good. In Scottsdale we find all these hipster millenials Mexican food, not that it is not good, but it is just does not have that mama food taste to it. Plates are huge and well priced. Need to come back for the churros!"}
{"text":"Love this place.. They always consistent and love how spicy their salsa is .. You can never go wrong with their chilaquiles plate for breakfast"}
{"text":"It's Cinco de Mayo. Perfect opportunity check off a list item. A convergence of sorts with others of like appetite. We were rewarded for our patience...place was hopping, but managed well. Adequate staffing, airy and spacious, great menu. Food was a hit. Taquitos de Camaron, Machaca Burrito, rice and beans. Spicy enough to provide some interest. Looking forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"When I was younger, I remember coming here for family meals and really liking it. It's been quite a few years since I had last visited until I went this past Friday night. I'm glad to report it was still delicious!

My party of 3 arrived at around 7 p.m. on Friday night. They quoted us a 25-30 minute wait. Thankfully, there is plenty of seating for those who are waiting, and it ended up only being about 15 minutes.

Our waitress was prompt with taking our drink orders and bringing out chips and salsa. My two friends started of with Micheladas. Although I am not a fan of Micheladas in general, my two friends loved the ones here. They also came in a ginormous beer mug, so make sure you're thirsty!

The chips and salsa were perfect! They mild salsa was kind of bland, but the spicy one was really flavorful and had the perfect kick. The chips were also perfectly cooked and not greasy.

For my meal, I had the green chili and potatoes, rice beans, and corn tortillas. A few of the tortillas were a weird crispy texture, and although the meat was good, it was a little dry. However, the rice and beans were great! Those were definitely some of the best beans I've had at a Mexican restaurant. They also had the perfect amount of cheese instead of the mounds that some places slop on.

My friends really enjoyed their meals- the machaca plate and a two taco combo plate. The tacos looked really good--I will be definitely ordering those next time!

One of the best parts was the value. The portions were huge--you could definitely share an entree here. My meal was about $10, and if I didn't completely pig out, I definitely could have taken home enough leftovers for a second meal."}
{"text":"Great Mexican is here.

I like that they offer two complimentary salsas: spicy and regular.  The spicy was a little too peppery for my taste.

I liked their guacamole, but it could have used a bit more salt.

The chicken chimichanga was delish.  It wasn't too greasy.  The side of beans were creamy, yum!

It is a nice big restaurant, so the wait isn't too long.  The restaurant is nice and clean, but the bathrooms could use a little TLC.  It smelled like old fish.

Our server was prompt with our orders and answered all of our questions.  This food is great!"}
{"text":"Simply the Best. When you want to impress your guests, or a business colleague, take them here? Completely safe, guarded, protected, patrolled parking lot for those of you scared to venture into unfamiliar territories. Outstanding from beginning to end. From friendly, enthusiastic welcomes, to prompt tableside attention. Delicious Margarita and Dos Equis to wash down fresh chips, and fiery salsa served in a delightful tiny gravy boat for pouring or dipping. At least 4 servers tending to your every whim from delivering food, to clearing plates. Presentation is everything and here they do it right! From spotless, immaculately clean everything, everywhere you look, to pressed slacks and dress shirts on all the servers, there is pride in everyone's performance here. The food is the Bonus! Excellent flavor, robust and tangy, complex, plentiful, fresh and filling. You want to clean your plate! Prices are more than fair and reasonable for what you get! Charming Mexico Decor throughout without being gawdy or cheesy. Nice enough to impress a date before a concert or show Downtown. Absolutely my favorite place to dine in South Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for Mexican food. The food is always fresh and the machaca is awesome! There is sometimes a long wait on the weekends but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant on two occasions before writing this review. The staff was friendly and helpful, and almost everyone speaks Spanish, which was nice since some of my family only speaks Spanish. The chips are fresh and the salsa is good. The food is not anything amazing. The rice and beans are good, and so was the carne asada. However someone in my group ordered the tripas and they said is was a little tough. 

TL;DR- Friendly people, good service, good food"}
{"text":"Green chili burrito, enchilada with red sauce....so damn good!! Haven't been anywhere else that's good this place. Gets a little warm in the summer, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place NEVER fails me! Always delicious, piping hot, fresh, yummy Mexican food and lots of chips and salsa!! I ordered the chile verde con papas and it was amazing!! I love when the server brings your food out and they say, \"be careful, hot plate\". Seriously the best because you know your food is going to be hot! Most sit-down Mexican food places in the Valley are mediocre at best...not Comedor Guadalajara!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around!  

Tons of parking, but it gets full on busy days. The wait time can be pretty long too, so be patient. The wait is WELL worth it!

My family and I love this place."}
{"text":"I loooooove this restaurant!! The food is fantastic, and the prices aren't bad as well! The location is a little scary (downtown Phoenix) but don't let that deter you from an awesome Mexican food experience!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! The beans are amazing - just like Nana's! I love the potato and beef tacos as well as the shrimp cocktail. I used to be a Poncho's on Central die hard but this place has a bigger menu selection and it's sooo good! If you want inexpensive authenticate Mexican food then this is your place! Love the cups of sopa they give you during lunch as a free appetizer along with the chips and salsa. Closed on Monday's so keep that in mind. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quality Mexican food at a reasonable in a family friendly atmosphere is how I would describe Comedor Guadalajara. While our salsa had a weird aftertaste the fajitas (chicken and steak) were amazing. The meat was seasoned but not overpowering and everything was tender. Even the veggies were delicious and had just the right amount of spice. My husband ordered the beef enchiladas (not pictured) and they were fantastic. We did not try the margaritas but we'll be back."}
{"text":"Visiting town from San Diego for my son's basketball tournament and this restaurant came very highly recommended from a good friend who used to live in Phoenix. Was so happy we were able to stop by for a meal. Delicious is an understatement -- rice was so fluffy, beans creamy and the green chili chicken enchiladas were flavorful. Our party of nine was super satisfied and can't wait to visit again when we are in the area. Too bad they were closed on Easter otherwise we would've ordered to-go for the ride home."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back from the Lucas Oil nations off road races at Crazy horse! Awesome food... service not bad:-) just do it if you in this hood!"}
{"text":"Does \"authentic\" mean \"good\"?

Not necessarily. 

I suppose the Comedor is more authentic than a place like Macayo's or Garcia's because they offer such typically Mexican delicacies as tripa and cabeza. They also have a menu full of the fish and mariscos that anglos tend not to order in typical Gringo-Mex outlets. They also don't drown their entrees under an avalanche of yellow cheddar cheese.

But as an experience I would say even if it does offer a greater selection of authentic menu items, it's not really that much more satisfying than the other places. 

I had the carne asada tacos, which were serviceable if not thrilling. The dish came out warm and didn't have the tell-tale signs of having sat under the salamander for longer than it should. At one time these tacos would have been a revelation to anyone weaned on the Lawry's hard-shell ones. Now, with their soft, grilled dual corn tortilla goodness wrapping them, they resemble any number of other \"street tacos\" that have become more and more popular recently.

The atmosphere is . . . well. . . \"comedor\" means \"dining room\" in Spanish. That's what it is: A big room full of tables. Mariachis were a nice touch.

We waited 30 minutes at lunchtime on a Saturday to get a table. Maybe that's why I am less than thrilled.  The place doesn't want for popularity. Aside from the wait, I had no complaints with the service.

So to the uninitiated, I would go with an open mind, not expecting a life-changing experience. I would also advise people to try the things like the lengua molcajete (a sort of tongue stew served in a lava bowl). The availability of stuff like that is what really sets Comedor apart.

And keep in mind that \"authentic\" doesn't always mean \"good\"."}
{"text":"I visited Comedor Guadalajara for the first time last night. This is a gigantic restaurant located in South Phoenix. 

The Good: The menu is extensive. The salsa they bring with your chips is hot and delicious. Ordered the \"three meat plate\" (for two) and was bombarded by a metal skillet (with it's own built in burner) heaped with a mountain of steak, chicken, pork, jalapenos, and onions. It was a meal for 4! The flavors were exquisite.

The Bad: The decor is bland, and the lights are brighter than the sun.

The Ugly: Nothing at all was ugly about the place. The staff and patrons were all very friendly. The bathroom was clean. The place felt safe outside even after dark (they have a security guard posted at the door)."}
{"text":"To start, the vibe is awesome as the building is classic outside and inside. Building is also huge! Of course the location is premier as it's off the I-17 on Central. The waiter was very nice and efficient. My girl ordered the chilaquiles and she let me try them. They were delicious. The red sauce has a great smokey taste. I ordered the green chile chimichanga enchilada style. That order came with a side of guac, sour cream, rice and beans. All of it was delicious. The green chile pork was simmered well as it was tender. Good spice to it, too. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It was simply amazing! I had the chimichangas while my friend had the menudo it was probably the best food I've had in a long time it wasn't to bland or spicy it was just right. The wait & staff were fast and exceptional. 
I will definitely be going back again & again!! :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Been here twice now and been great each time. Hade the lunch special green chili beef chimichanga. Beef was tender, food was very hot. Some of the best rice I have found. I just wish I lived closer lol"}
{"text":"Workers are nice and the food is amazing. Everything is good here. Quesadillas de Chile rojo and hand made tortillas"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food. The Chilequillas and Chicharones are amazing! Very low key ambiance and this place can get packed. Wait list up to 30 minutes are very common. Pick your times carefully here. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Greasy tacos, the only thing good was the spicy salsa. I got the chicken tacos and they were hella greasy with half-melted cheese."}
{"text":"My family and I found this place when we were looking for an authentic place to take a friend from out of town. Boy did we hit the jackpot! I lived in Tucson for 7 years and I have always struggled to find a good Mexican restaurant in the valley. Everything from the salsa, to the cheese crisp, to the enchilada style chicken burrito, to the raw seafood something or other my husband ordered was absolutely perfect. The service was decent too on a Friday night at 7 pm. We will definitely drive here from chandler again! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sit down Mexican Restaurant. I ordered a a green chili beef enchilada and a carne asada chimichanga. The only bummer was the 1hr plus wait time on Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food in Phoenix, Arizona that you'll find. I'm originally from Tucson, Arizona which isn't too far but I usually taste the difference in the food. A lot of places in Phoenix for Mexican food aren't as tasty as the ones in Tucson, however, this place really is. It doesn't look really big from the outside, but the inside is huge! It would probably be great for large groups. There is always enough parking, the staff there is great, and the food is unforgettable."}
{"text":"This is always a great place to run into friends and to eat with family.  Of course. I start with a cheese crisp, but my family always gets the Parrillada.  It's BOMB with Tripas,  Carnitas and Carne Asada.  It's always goods.  Great place to bring your entire family."}
{"text":"I went here before they got a lot bigger, and after as well. I must say even though the wait is long to get in, the food is amazing and worth the wait. I will say this is this is one of the best Mexican food places in Phoenix. Certainly in my top five."}
{"text":"Fried foods are my friend. My sister and BIL were making fun of me because I seem to choose fried foods wherever available. 

I ordered the chicken chimichanga to stick with my fried food cravings. It was huge, delicious and I ate the whole thing. The rice and beans were nothing special. 

The salsa was really spicy, a level 9 spice. My sister looked like she was crying from eating it and just stuck with the chips. I was asking for a straw, it was THAT good. 

I bought four churros to take home. They were a bit overcooked and crunchy. I wouldn't order them again."}
{"text":"This is old-school Sonoran food. It's good! Hot sauce, chips, guacamole (though I think it has sour cream in it), enchilada sauce (both green and red), tacos, crispy cheese crisps, tasty medium-heat green chiles -- all good! 

The only item that was lesser to my taste was the chile relleno, though the red tomato sauce on it was delicious.

Give it a shot. There's a reason why this restaurant has been successful for so long."}
{"text":"One star for not serving breakfast past 11am on SUNDAY!  Flew in for work, came highly recommend. Waited an hour sat down and ordered at 11:07am and the waitress said sorry sir breakfast stops at 11!  UNBELIEVABLE!! I will never be back!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Everything our party ordered received rave reviews.  I had the beef enchilada and the chili relleno and they were awesome."}
{"text":"Tasting the chicken enchiladas and Enchiladas de Camaron (green chile & tomatillo shrimp enchiladas) made us ask, after decades of tasting enchiladas at dozens of other good restaurants, so THIS is what they're supposed to taste like?! Don't miss the mango-lime margarita. It's all magnificent, and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was great. Took a retiring friend there for lunch. She loved it, the whole experience  was perfoect."}
{"text":"For authentic, delicious, genuine Mexican food.... Be sure to stop by Comedor Guadalajara!!! I searched Tempe and Phoenix for 4 years looking for authentic Mexican food. Tucson has it at every corner, but unfortunately Phoenix is known for having Tex-Mex. After flying with a crew member who said his friend recommended this place I was a little weary. However, after pulling up and seeing a line of about a 100 people, with some of them carrying out Moving Boxes FULL of take out, I was reassured that this had to be good! 

They told us seating would take about 40 minutes, but it only took 20. This place is deceiving. It is much larger than it looks from the outside. Service was fast, and the smell makes your mouth water!

I order the machaca chimichanga, which was soooooo good!!! And a margarita which did not taste as strong as it was. Hats off to the bartender. Overall we were so happy with our orders, but I have to say my chimichanga was the tastiest meal at our table. So if you are thinking about ordering it, you will not be disappointed :) ."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered the #1 Combo, Cheese Enchilada, Taco, & Tostada with Rice & Beans. Salsa & Chips served as the appetizer. The salsa reminded me of enchilada sauce and it's SPICY! Have a glass of water handy! The enchilada was adequate, the taco was ground beef and tasted like it had a Taco Bell type seasoning in it. (A huge no-no for any restaurant other than Taco Bell!) But the shell was fried true Mexican style, thank goodness! Next time I'm going to ask for a shredded beef taco. And I hear the Quesadillas are excellent so there will be a next time! I also had an Arnold Palmer and it was one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Decided for Christmas Eve to come here for breakfast, which made the holiday even better. I have been here several times, as it's been part of the central Ave makeup for a long time. 

Food; Huevos Rancheros was amazing, perfect spices and heat. Everything is super fresh and hot, made to order. The chips and salsa are by far the best around. 

Service; Server was speedy and quit, and very informational on menu items."}
{"text":"I went here based on the Yelp reviews and from recommendations from my husband's co-workers. I won't be returning. I was already skeptical about coming here because of the multiple Yelp reviews mentioning the security guard in the parking lot and the shady part of town that it's located in.  My husband and I got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas. The shredded beef was so dry and overcooked that I only ate half my taco and was over it.  The beef enchilada was filled with huge chunks of beef, which were tender but lacking in flavor.  The rice and beans were nothing special.

oh yeah....  the chips they bring out when you arrive come with tiny bowls of salsa that you can barely dip your chips in because of how small and shallow the bowls are."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for over two years now from my coworker.  He had been bragging about it being the best authentic Mexican food here in Phoenix.  So finally today for lunch I decided I need to go try this place out.  I was very glad I finally went.  I had the lunch special of a stuffed poblano and shrimp enchilada.  While waiting on my food I was greated with chips and a yummy spicy salsa and a soup with veggies and beef.  Both were very good and I was then worrying that I wouldn't have room to finish my meal.  Before I could decide to put away the chips the food arrived.  I was surprised how fast they cooked my meal and once I tasted it I was amazed with the great flavor of the sauces.  The enchilada had a very good tasting green sauce and the chile was smothered in a spicy red sauce with onions.  The rice and beans on the side were good but after finishing the main course I had just a bite of each to see what they tasted like.  I will have to head back again for dinner as the menu was full of wonderful items I wanted to try."}
{"text":"Our son was recommended to this restaurant by a lady who does her own catering and says that this is her favorite.  We are always up for Mexican food especially the Mom and Pop places.  The lady was  spot on with her recommendation.  This was a Saturday afternoon at about 1.30 PM. and we still has a small wait for about 15 min.  What first struck me was the tables are far apart from each other.  Usually you get a cramped feeling and frankly it  gets noisy. Not in this case.  I love the fact there were not many Gringos . So the restaurants screams authenticity.  I'm a wimp and usually one that orders the Green Enchiladas with Green Sauce, Rice and always no beans.  This was by far the very best ones I have ingested from Tucson to Phoenix.  The sauce also has mild green peppers so the combination of the chicken, the sauce and the additional peppers makes this stand out.  Hubby had the Chili Rellano with a ground beef and potato taco.  Loved it as well.  The prices are fair on most of the combos.  
But there are some really different items in the Seafood like Capechana, Cervice de Camaron, Steak Picano, Carnitas de Puerto which is deep fried chunks of pork loin, Chimichangas, Burritos.  I saw several people order dishes with Mole Sauce (Chocolate) but couldn't find it on the menu.  The service was good as well.    Place is conveniently located just off the freeway on Central.  I'm from Tucson so I don't get to Phoenix to often but this will sure be a stop we will make."}
{"text":"I ordered the tampiqueña, a traditional Mexican plate. This plate is supposed to be prepared with SKIRT steak, they use some cheap stuff here... If you want a better tasting tampiqueña go to Manuel's instead.

Food here is just average, if that...

To make matters worse, they \"ran out\" of horchata at 3pm on a Saturday, what kind of \"mexican restaurant \"allows that!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm one of the few Arizona natives left and have visited this place since my childhood! They never fail to impress with their food. Everything is delicious. The only thing that would make this place better is a nice bar where we can wait for our turn! Lol But honestly, for the amount of people waiting? They move pretty fast. Thank you for being \"that place\" where can take anyone new wanting great, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"An excellent place to grab a quick bite.  The weekday lunch features a mostly professional crowd, with long waits around noon. When you finally get inside, try the ceviche."}
{"text":"By far - by leaps and bounds, the best Mexican food in the entire Phoenix area. 

Shrimp and seafood Veracruzana - the dish I've had the last two times here is simply exquisite. The sauce would make an old shoe taste great! Its complexity makes your mind race trying to figure out what's in it. This time, I tasted warmth - cinnamon...possibly cloves or nutmeg. Not much - just a hint of it. But the warmth was but a kiss of mystery. The flour tortilla was served nice and hot. It was of the fresh and dry variety - not the spongy waxy variety. The rice is simple - allowing the rest of the meal to shine and not be overpowered by over seasoned sides 

My husband had the enchiladas de camarones. Again, the sauce was expertly crafted and had the richness of a fine fine French sauce. 

We started the meal with the coctel de camaron. Like everything else - expertly prepared with the freshest ingredients."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for years and every time the service and food are outstanding! Definitely a super busy place but you can see why people come back because the service and quality are consistent. Both breakfast and dinner are always good and I have tried many different things ( quesadilla, nachos, albondigas, red chimi, combinations , chilaquiles) and all have been great! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very good food. The cheese enchiladas, tacos and green chili are excellent.  I recommend the chorizo dip for an appetizer.  This place is extremely busy on Friday nights so expect to wait.  They only give you the mild salsa if you request it. The hot salsa is just too hot for me but it's good."}
{"text":"This place has been around for as long as I can remember. Each time my family and I have come here, the food is always on point and never a disappointment. Their ticket times are quick, they food is tasty and full of flavor. You have a choice between two salsa's, both are very good! I have yet to find any restaurant that can compare in their food. Many of their dishes are very comforting and remind me of the way my grandmother used to cook. Staff is quick and friendly. 

My family and I will always be loyal customers of Comedor Guadalajara!"}
{"text":"Huge restaurant with authentic cuisine and family style. We chose from their seafood options and were not disappointed. Portions were huge so there was no place for dessert."}
{"text":"Es muy poca calidad en la comida y los fines de semana se tarda hasta 45 minutos para esperar a ordenar y otra 30 minutos en que te dan la orden.prefiero 
Los Mexican friends. Mejor precio y mucho sabor y calidad en los platillos.visiten y no se arrepentiran."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican Food restaurant. The guacamole is awesome. My husband likes the shredded beef tacos I love the green chile burros enchilada style with green sauce. I have tried many other things on the menu and they are all good! The salsa is great the people are friendly.
It is clean and I always know what we are getting."}
{"text":"I (finally) tried Comedor Guadalajara with a friend in from out of town last weekend. I was surprised by how busy they were on a Sunday at lunch time- there were people crowded in front of the restaurant and they announced names over an intercom. Whoa. We were seated fairly quickly in the (extremely large) dining room and service was efficient from that point on. The chips and salsa were more like chips and hot sauce, but they tasted good... I love the spiciness of the sauce and put it on everything. When it came to ordering, we were a little disappointed. My friend is a vegetarian and thought Mexican food would be no problem, but our waitress didn't know of almost anything on the menu that was vegetarian (most items have lard). He ended up getting cheese enchiladas and thought they were pretty 'meh.' Here's the real kicker though, I got the chicken burrito, which was absolutely delicious.... the chicken was juicy and cooked well... but the burrito mainly consisted of fantastic and flavorful grilled veggies...the type that would be perfect for a vegetarian perhaps.... hmmm. Anyway, other than that mishap, I really enjoyed my burrito and would go back to get it again. 


PS prices were reasonable, especially at lunch, and the portions were large."}
{"text":"Very good eating. Everything on the menu is great. I've tried several selections and the portions are huge. Wait times are a little long especially on Sunday but it's with the wait. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 16 to celebrate a Birthday and they were very accommodating and on point! This was my first time there and I really enjoyed the food and service. I ordered the molcajete de camaron which is a spicy shrimp hot soup in the stone bowl with nopales and cheese. It was delicious and very filling I took half home, to drink I got horchata because everyone recommended it to and it was good not the best I've had but good. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because they made a really big deal about not splitting checks or letting us pay with more than 3 cards. I understand we were a large group but we asked before hand to split and they said yes then when it came time to pay they said no so it was annoying having to do the collection rounds and needing to get cash out. Other than that it was a good time and we would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to authentic Mexican restaurant. The beans here are delicious! The machaca is awesome. I have not had anything bad here. The salsa that comes out is so flavorful and has a slow burn so be prepared."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Top notch customer service and delicious authentic Mexican food. I love the fact that there salsa is actually SUPER HOT and not mild. They have good daily specials . I recommend the parrilladas, and the enchiladas. The beans are to die for !"}
{"text":"Comedor Guadalajara es muy delicioso!  Me encanta enchiladas!  Their enchiladas were good.  I got plain red cheese, and they did not disappoint.  I was more impressed by the menudo....mmmmm!  Great place, and its HUGE inside!"}
{"text":"The customer service was excellent however the food was a bit too salty. I couldn't finish my ceviche. I was also disappointed with the dish because the broth was not red it was white and had too much lime juice in it.  I most likely will not come back."}
{"text":"Much favor has been heaped in previous reviews and no dissent here. This place is great; eaten here many a time. Easy to get to from anywhere in the valley, at corner of I-17 and Central Ave. 

Excellent food, great service--even for a party of 22. Nice beverage assortment. Try a cold Carta Blanca, instead of a Modelo or that shite that begins with the third letter of the alphabet. 
And, by all means, order a Vampiro, if you've not tried one. Tequila, Sangrita, and Squirt soda pop--muy rico!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Mexican food places to eat. Be sure to wait in line during lunch and dinner times anywhere from 30 minutes to 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm sad wanted to like the place. I don't. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. The beans and rice were not authentic nor flavorful. If a Mexican restaurant can not get these key items right, don't expect much. Sorry."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is amazing but since they stared charging extra for 2 chips not happy."}
{"text":"El mejor restaurante mexicano de Phoenix!!! 
The best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. They are 100% authentic, their service is great and the food is served in a timely manner. I wish that I had the option to give them 100 stars because they definitely deserve it. Just so you know I've been coming to this restaurant for 3 years and they just get better and better. 

- my favorite plate is Chile relleno :D"}
{"text":"One of my \"must stops\" when I am in Phoenix. Great breakfast, awesome Horchata & the best Carne Asada Tampiquena around. Granted, the chips and salsa are nothing to rave about but everything else here is superb. 

The staff is very polite and service is prompt and reliable."}
{"text":"I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food, but I love this place. for $8.50 I got the cheese enchilada and shredded taco plate that came with rice, beans, and a small cup of veggie soup. it was all extremely delicious! especially the beans. I have no idea what they put in there, but it tasted so good that I cleaned my plate (and I am a light-eater so I usually NEVER clean my plate and I usually don't even eat the side rice and beans).

I will definitely be back again. the only downsides to this place that I've seen so far are: long wait if you go at lunch rush, not located in a great neighborhood, chips and salsa are meh (would've given 5 stars if the salsa was better), and it closes at 8 PM."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican food in the valley!! Lunch time and after church (10 am ish) on sundays is heavy traffic times! Be ready to wait, but it's oh so worth it!! I've had a wide variety of different entrees there and not one has ever disappointed me!! During lunch you even get never ending alphabet soup like when you were a kid!! They do not split checks for large parties which is kind of a downer and they now charge for extra bowls of chips.. but I still say they are the best!!"}
{"text":"I've driven by here a few times, but this weekend decided to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.

Comedor Guadalajara's exterior is pretty unassuming.  Looks like a brownish/pinkish box.  Once you walk in, you can see that while they have some nice Mexican items, let's just say you won't be paying for the decor.  When I went by Sunday afternoon their after church crowd was huge.  I was just getting mine to go luckily.  I didn't hear anyone quoted more than a 10-15 min wait - and some of those were crowds of 8-10.  Walking through the restaurant - it's huge!  There is so much seating I can understand why it was the go to spot.  

Also, I loved the mix of folks.  There was this guy in a cowboy hat, plaid shirt w/ jeans tucked into his cowboy boots standing right next to a guy in a full suit w/ a snazzy tie and shiny shoes.  It was really a great snapshot of Downtown/Southern Phoenix.  So yea, there were like 2 white groups.  But the rest of this place was a somewhere in the brown scale.  Black, Hispanic and mixed folks all hanging out waiting for the food.  To me, this is a good sign.  

The Chicken Chimi was absolutely amazing.  Some of the most flavorful chicken pieces with lots of red & green pepper and onions.  I also tried their Pechuga Asado which was really good.  3 lunch meals, plus a 60 cent \"to go charge\" (weird, huh?) came out to $35.19.  We will definitely be going back again next time to try all their amazing seafood platters.  While they looked outstanding, I didn't think they were quite \"to go\" kind of food.  Something to look forward to next time..."}
{"text":"It was great but not worth the hype or the 30 minute wait on Sunday for a late lunch. I got the carnitas. My buddy got the green chile chicken enchiladas. Both were good. People rave about the horchata. It was good and thick but lacked a bit more  cinnamon. 

My brother says I'm an idiot for not getting a chimichanga."}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ for almost 20 years and this place is one of my favorite Mexican joints. Huge parking lot and the restaurant seems to get bigger every time we go. Yummy salsa & chips. Cheap margaritas. Delicious food. Machaca is amazing, garlic shrimp is my stand by, and everything else in between. I've never had a bad meal here & service is usually quick."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix, especially if you are a red chile lover. Love the micheladas too. My only complaints would be the lengthy wait times to be sat on the weekends and the lack of a chunky salsa."}
{"text":"Best Mexican breakfast ever. The refried beans are the bomb. This is the best Machaca, chileqiles, eggs and beans EVER!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic service, extremely clean inside. One of the best, if not the best Mexican food restaurants in AZ. South Phoenix hidden gem. Blows ponchos out of the water. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. It is a restaurant that mixes GREAT food with a diverse crowd. You see large families, small families, persons on a date, girls night out and even workforce stopping in for a meal. They have a happy hour also, but I haven't experienced that. The price is very reasonable and the staff is friendly and efficient . I was surprised to see a crowd on Tuesday since there are abbreviated hours on that day. You go once and you see why this place is so special."}
{"text":"Disgusting. You should be ashamed. USED to love this place. Until today, my niece ordered a Margarita after a few sips she noticed there was a hair in it. Before sending it back we purposely loaded it with salt. Waitress brought her a \"new\" Margarita, but yup you guessed it, the top was filled with fresh mix while all else was the same SALTY one we sent back (That we purposely salted). SHAME ON YOU!!! BUSTED!"}
{"text":"Great food, sort of slow service but it was PACKED on a Thursday night. I'm more of a Oaxacan style fan, but this was great. Ate the Machaca burrito, never had machaca with egg, onion and jalapeño before. It was delicious though."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate dinner here with the International Supper Club UYE group a couple of nights ago. We were both happy to see that they had such a great selection of Mexican beers and so hubby was able to get a Bohemia instead of settling for the usual Corona or XX. I was super happy to order a Michelada and as always that put me in the mood for seafood which is perfect since Comedor Guadalajara not only has traditional Mexican entrees but a variety of Mexican style seafood dishes on their menu.

Even though we were served chips and salsa immediately upon being seated, we decided to start with the chorizo bean dip since that sounded pretty tasty. I was expecting it to be served in a small dish like the salsa but instead it came out with a giant portion and a bunch of thicker chips topped with melted cheese. Fortunately my fellow Yelpers helped us out but we still couldn't finish it. I love bean dip in general but this one had a great flavor from the chorizo and I didn't feel like it was too greasy. I would say that the chorizo bean dip is a must-order if you are with a group.

After that, we got our entrees. My hubby got the Tampiquena steak which was a skirt steak seasoned and broiled and served with rice and beans. Most people would call that carne asada so I am not sure why they didn't name it that on the menu. I thought Tampiquena was when they chop up the steak and put chili sauce and cheese on it. But I haven't seen that outside of Texas so maybe that's a regional thing, I don't know. Anyway, he loves steak so was happy with the meat but he thought the rest of it was just ok. Growing up on the border we are picky about tortillas and these were not very authentic looking and he said they also were not great tasting but not bad either.

I ordered the Campechana and that also turned out to be a humongous portion (see pic). They serve it in a huge bowl like soup instead of a tall footed glass dish like seafood cocktail (cockteles) are usually served in. However, it wasn't really that much more substance in the bowl, it seemed to be mostly Clamato. I did like the flavoring of the broth but I thought the quality of the seafood could have been better. I also thought it was really weird that they served it with lemons and not limes. That kind of gave it a weird taste but I added some more hot sauce and that fixed it!

Even though its not the best Mexican food I've had we still had a really good time. It's a pretty nice looking restaurant, I am really surprised that some of the other reviewers called it a dive? Also, our waitress Anna was awesome and everyone else we interacted with seemed really nice as well."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican restaurant. Watch portions: they are huge. I had machaca con huevos and it was delicious. They have great freshly squeezed orange juice. Watch for dirty Old Mexicans grabbing waitresses asses. If you stalk it out patiently it will happen. Also, be ready to wait on Saturday mornings."}
{"text":"2 words...  GREASY MESS!!!  If this is authentic then my mom had it all wrong but my mom knew how to make enchiladas and beans without a quart of grease. We won't go back."}
{"text":"I want to be as fair as I can when I am writing this review. I am not a native of Arizona and I think this may make my review somewhat biased. I wasn't too impressed with the food here. I had a chili relleno and a chicken burrito, both smothered. The portions were large, as expected in a Mexican food restaurant, the service was good, the gentleman that was helping us was extremely courteous. The margarita that I ordered (strong) I needed an extra shot, it wasn't strong enough for me. When this happened the Manager came over to me to make sure everything was ok - which was awesome! Needless to say, I added the shot and the margarita got demolished!  My chili relleno was a little soggy and I asked for it extra crispy, not too important, but I just wanted it cooked a little longer than normal. One SUPER positive things I can say about Comedor Guadalajara is that they had some of the best rice and beans I have ever had! 
All in all, I think my overall experience has to do with the Mexican food here tasting distinctly different than the Mexican food in Denver, both of which are as authentic as you can get, not this Tex Mex B.S.
When I go back to Phoenix, would I come back here, probably not, I would want to try a different place to see if they have a different Phoenix, authentic Mexican food flare. If I was invited to go back and somebody was paying for me, I would definitely go, however; I would order something different."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican resturant near downtown. Went for lunch. We arrived just before noon and we're seated immediately (Saturday) and left about 1pm and there was a mob waiting to get in. Service was good. Food was also very good. Our party had tacos, both beef and chicken, taco salad, chimichangas, and enchiladas. Everyone's food was very good. By the way, the margaritas are huge and very tasty. If you are in the neighborhood this is a very good place to eat."}
{"text":"Use to come here alot. We recently move to Avondale so little far way now. But said it's be awhile let's take a drive, they have great food. Well I can say the food is still great but unfortunately our waitress service was garbage and she had an attitude. Plus now you are charging for refills for chips and salsa??? Wow. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Tex Mex Mexican food. I only have two or three go to spots that I am stuck on but I must say this place is one of the better Mexican restaurants in town. Service is always friendly and great. The menu is eclectic and large. The food is good. Beware though, unless you go on an off time the place is totally packed all the time. You will have to wait a little bit for  a table. I would suggest before 5pm on Friday nights and not on the weekends."}
{"text":"Three words: Shredded Beef Enchiladas.  if you've never had them then you're missing out. I catered this meal for passengers I was flying and they kept asking where it came from. They loved every bit of the meal. I went to get the food from the restaurant which is beautifully decorated and super clean. The meals were neatly packaged and I was able to re-heat them with ease. Our distinguished guest we flew loved her meals and ate every part of it. Thank you for the outstanding service and I hope to enjoy this restaurant again."}
{"text":"i use to go by here every day of the week and never knew this place was open. the parking lot always empty. in fact i've had several people i trust tell me how great this place was..and i never realized..THIS was the place they were talking about. gasp. 

so i came her with my BFF's family for fathers day. it was pretty damn good. after a very long wait and eventual long walk to the rear dining room we got seated. chips pretty tasty, sales pretty spicy. food was delish..i got carnitas and they were big porky chunks of awesomeness. they gave me large tortillas..which was ok cause i just tore off pieces to pick up meat. my one complaint...it reminded me of my highschool cafeteria. Jaguar Pride What!! anyways..the vast openess and still confined spacing of the restaurant. if there was a fire breakout..i don't think anyone would make it out alive tho. :(

carnitas were bombdigity yaheard!! get on it. 

price is affordable, and the menu distinctly not, run of the mill \"mexican food\""}
