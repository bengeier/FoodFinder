{"text":"Social hall is a wonderful addition to Tempe. Our food was delicious, our drinks were strong and the games were free. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My husband and I met a few friends who were in town pheonix. I found this place on yelp and it was a lot of fun. Nice patio area and area inside. Plenty of games and would love to see some music on the patio. We only had drinks and appetizers while there. The nachos were awesome, but the queso and buffalo califlower were ok. The califlower app was very small, should be a side not an appetizer.  The prices are ok, but worth the atmosphere. We will stop in again with more friends."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!!!! We came and were super excited to find free games! Skee ball, PacMan, Mario Cart, Buck Hunter, and more! Definitely an awesome place to hang out and get drinks."}
{"text":"awesome venue with a great atmosphere. the food is delicious and the servers are always on top of the drinks and food. I will always love coming here! Did I mention that they have free games like giant Jenga, Pacman?, darts, Galaga, and ping pong!"}
{"text":"This is the spot I always wanted in Tempe.  Wide open, tons of games, space, plenty of beers on tap, full bar, GREAT happy hour and owners that know what they want to do going forward.  I hope more groups start coming here to enjoy a fun group outing because this place will be even more fun when it's got lots of folks enjoying themselves in such a neat space."}
{"text":"They have great food, an amazing patio!!! Service is awesome too . Don't forget about the free games and pool."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything about this place is great. Food was delicious! I had the Cali Chicken Sandwich and sweet potato fries...OMG! Loved it. Not your typical restaurant, it has style. Great date night spot!"}
{"text":"I love coming here when I'm in Tempe! They just had a grand opening and seem to be off to a great start. Love the vibe and look this place has going on! Most importantly the service is fantastic. Last time I stopped in I had Alex as my server, she was so attentive and sweet the entire time! She made sure my drink was never empty and my food came out hot & in a timely fashion. Will be back very soon! Highly recommend asking for Alex whenever you visit Social hall. She's the best!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday with come coworkers to check it. Food was great and so was the service. My only complaint which is why the 3 stars was no soap in the men's bathroom. I did let manager I believe know. I went back again a little later to wash my hands and still no soap. Not very sanitary."}
{"text":"I went to the Social Hall last night with a big group of people. We arrived in a party bus, all of us dressed as old people (party theme). The Social Hall was our first stop for the night and we were received very well given the group size and the outfits. The drinks were well priced and the service was fairly fast. The bar has an entertainment area with lots of free arcade games, an outdoor area and an indoor area. Our time there was very limited due to our \"quick stop\" but I had a great time and I would like to return very soon."}
{"text":"Have to say that this new restaurant is well worth the drive from our home in North Phoenix to Tempe!  We had been once before during the Grand Opening and totally enjoyed the \"Social Burger\" with all the trimmings and the Fries are fantastic.  But this time, I was told by the staff that the Nachos were worth trying as a new special cheese sauce has been added and, especially the \"Grilled Steak\" version, is extra special.  Well, talk about an understatement!  Wow!!  This may sound cliche, but the Grilled Steak nachos were absolutely incredible!!  Do yourself a big favor and try em.  Oh, and don't pass up the chance for a free game of pool or SkeeBall while you're there.  FUN!!"}
{"text":"First time here. I had chicken tacos and it was great. Good selection of beer on tap. Spacious patio. Great service. Clearly good food is a priority. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We sat outside in the shade for Happy Hour. The green chilli Mac  & cheese was delicious and priced right. Will definitely be back. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday for happy hour and had a great experience - amazing, lively space, plenty of free games, a great bartender and delicious bar food - what a nice surprise!    I had a glass of Chilean Sauvignon Blanc and we shared the green Chile mac 'n cheese, buffalo cauliflower, Mexican street corn, garlic fries and an order of 2 pork green chile tamales.  The food is very reasonable and the portions are quite generous.  Definitely a great place for happy hour to enjoy food, drinks and fun games...plus a great patio too!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place! A friend and I went here on a whim and while it wasn't very busy, it was such a cool environment. Hammocks everywhere, arcade games, board games, giant Jenga... and not to mention amazing drinks (the margarita and dark and stormy were so good)  we will for sure be back"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Poorly staffed, lead bartender/manager is a dbag - to put it gently. Food is mediocre at best. Had the chimmichuri sandwich and hot dog plate. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but those were awful. If you can get a seat outside during the nice weather, that may be the only redeeming aspect. The \"games\" are a joke.  Here is the kicker-they have Guinness, but nothing for a Black and Tan. The head bartender recommended adding Coors light to the Guinness to make one. Enough said"}
{"text":"Finally scoped this cool spot out today for lunch and I LOVED the vibe. The atmosphere was laid back, vintage with a twist of modern. A place F. Scott Fitzgerald and the Great Gatsby would have gone for happy hour if one were not fictional and the other not dead.   If you remember the building's predecessor, you will be delighted to see the renovations preserved the old arcade games (FREE play). They have a shuffleboard, pool tables, and ping pong. The outdoor area has hanging hammock chairs and 2 large fire pits to gather round. I can't wait to come here with a group of friends!  The food was great. I ordered coconut shrimp that was crunchy and tasty, a hit for sure! El Chapo burger was good, but a bit dry overall, however still good. I ordered it with the sweet potato fries, and not one single fry was left, because seriously, they are like crack, you cannot just eat one, you wanna finish the whole batch! The Three Amigos appetizer was complimentary which btw, you can get if you sign your email up with them. The pico, green salsa, and guac were all tasty and the chips were fresh and perfectly salted. We were sad that the serving sizes of the dips were not proportionate to the amount of chips that came with it. We would've happily devoured a more generous serving haha!   We came early and there was one server who was also the bartender. She was attentive and sweet, kept our glasses full the whole time. I will definitely be back for Happy Hour and possibly a night out of debauchery. To be continued..."}
{"text":"One word: AWESOME!  Don't miss this new gem.  My wait person was fantastic!  She gave me just enough attention.  The food was great.  I started with the beet salad.  I love beets.   It had goat cheese, watercress, crushed pecans, and quinoa.  It had a light vinaigrette that complimented it perfectly.   My main course was the ribeye.  It was perfection.  As a side I had the shoestring fries.   For my Midwest palette it was exactly what I needed."}
{"text":"The service here sucked. It took 2 hours for me to get three tacos. The tacos were not even good portion. The idea of the place is great just need to get their staff up to pace."}
{"text":"Unique spot for dinner and drinks! I went to the social hall with a group of girls to watch the Miss USA pageant and everything was great from the food to the service! The owner came over to our group and checked on us a few times! The bartender was super sweet (forgot her name). They have a super cute outdoor area, a game room and a seperate upstairs area they are renovating currently! The inside is more of an intimate feel, great spot for a date night! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Super cool concept! The games are free which is awesome, I just wish that they weren't older, used, somewhat broken machines.... also, they have pool and table tennis on the patio, but both of those are weak as well when it comes to design and material. Not to be a negative nelly here, but it was also fairly hot the whole time- they definitely did not have the A/C on...  The food was delicious! Heads up*** the tacos are absolutely tiny!!!!  I ordered a chicken sandwich as well with sweet potato fries which I would certainly order again. We will be coming back for sure. I'm sure other food items are great to order. Excited to try some more menu items out."}
{"text":"Went with a group on the 13th. The food is average and the bar kept telling us they didn't have the stuff to make drinks we asked for. They also didn't know how to make certain drinks. The space is beautiful but there are better places to get food and drinks close by."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place. Really cool concept. Free game. Nice staffs! Food is great. My friend and I shared the paella and it's a good size for us. Given 3 stars cause, I called and made a reservation because we have a big party. A party of 15 ppl. When we arrived they told me that they don't do reservation which I thought they do when having a large party?? Another thing is that I ordered a virgin margarita and I felt like it was just pure lemon juice...."}
{"text":"Good food and beer options. Can get a little bro-y for atmosphere, but still a good place to pick up lunch."}
{"text":"I love it here! I came here for the first time today and wow there's so much entertainment! The place itself is huge. There's so much to do. You can spend time outside at the hammock, play billiards, jenga, ping-pong, or stay in doors for live entertain upstairs and play games. Not only is the entertainment great, also their food was on the good side. I'm usually not a big fan of bar foods but it was decent. I ordered their chicken sandwich with truffle & Parmesan fries, pretty good. Their drinks are amazing. I can't complain. If you looking for a social/birthday/hangout with friends, I'd recommend hanging out here. You definitely won't be bored. They also have happy hour Monday-Friday. I forgot the times but I think it's regular happy hour times."}
{"text":"Food was alright and service was alright too. I ordered nachos and the toppings were slim and I asked for chicken but the server forgot to put it on. Meh. The atmosphere is super cool and I am not sure what drinks they really have that are specialty since we never got a drink menu. I wouldn't mind trying it again in hopes these were just minor issues upon opening but we'll see!"}
{"text":"Great space, really fantastic staff. Games are always fun (and currently free?! Definite bonus!), lot of really awesome potential here"}
{"text":"We had a group of nearly 40 people come to check out The Social Hall and it truly is one of the best bars I have been to in Phoenix/Tempe for atmosphere, multiple spaces for large groups, drink & food menu, and fun activities.  Hang outside if it isn't too cold, play some ping pong, go inside to play video games or foosball. Just constant entertainment. And the drink and food selections cater to everyone."}
{"text":"I like the idea of this space, and think it's definitely something that's becoming more popular! The location of this isn't super central to anything in Tempe, but the facility is huge, so it (for the most part) feels like a destination when you arrive. For as big as it is, I do wish they had more games - just a single pool table and ping pong table outside plus a few arcade games inside didn't seem to shout \"stay a while.\"   I did think it was a little expensive for what it was - drinks are $10+, entrees are $20+, and the smaller plates/sandwiches menu items were few and far between. The happy hour menu looked great, though, so we'll try to make it back for that."}
{"text":"What a wonderful atmosphere, great food, amazing inside and out. Lots of games and great service! New hang out. Always loved minder binders but this place is so cool! Love the Social Hall! Marley is the best!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was relaxing and enjoyable. Our waitress was something else. The fish tacos were pretty decent. I've never had a waitress so rude! She rolled her eyes about half a dozen times, never checked up on us, and never received any refills. Not to mention, my card was charged twice.. she did not give me any notice until I checked my bank account the following day. I attempted to contact management, and have had no luck getting ahold of someone."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot in Tempe!! Replaced the old Minder Binder location. Kinda hidden away, but once you find it it's absolutely gonna become your favorite hang out. The food was to DIE for!!!! That's not an exaggeration either. Well priced for great proportion sizes. Live entertainment, FREE GAMES, that's right I said free games!! The staff seemed Amazing but one person in particular was our Bartender.... I think his name was Nathan?!? I'm sorry if it's not,  but he's the tall, dark and handsome tattooed man behind the bar. He was exquisite. He recommended all our drinks and food. He seemed super busy back there by himself, yet he still found time to make it seem like my group of 9 were the only ones in the building. He made us some of the best cocktails we have ever had anywhere. He truly went above and beyond for us. Honestly the venue is ridiculously huge. Yet, they give Amazing service no matter how busy they got. Honestly I would return for the food and venue alone! But Nathan, if that's his name, took such good care of us. We are literally thinking about changing our wedding reception venue to here. This place will knock your socks off. It's a must see and experience type of place. I've never experienced dining the way I did here. Whoever the new owner is knows exactly what he's doing. Because the minder binder was NEVER this good!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"You must go! Great atmosphere. Great servers. Great food! Met one of the owners tonight and he said there's even more to come! This will be my new go to spot!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to this building now called social Hall. I went yesterday for happy hour with some co-workers. I love what they have done with the place. It is nicely setup, has games in the back, and in the covered patio. Staff was friendly and quick to refill our drinks. We had some nachos, green chili mac n cheese, and buffalo cauliflower. Everything was great. A really nice place for happy hour with good food at cheap prices. Defiantly recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"I took the 12 minute drive here from my house in Scottsdale to check out this new spot during their soft opening. What a cool location! Completely re-vamped, it is located at the old \"minder binders\" on McClintock, behind the circle K. The first thought i had was \"whoa, this place is huge\". You enter through an outdoor patio area which houses 3 or 4 pool tables, into the front doors where you immediately see the bar area. The bar and restaurant area has a ton of seating, friendly staff, great music playing- the vibe was just right... I thought \"i could bring a date here, or I could just as easily come here with the boys\". On the opposite side of the wall from the bar there were Mario Kart arcades connected to each other, that were free to play and a foosball table. I also noticed that coming from upstairs it looked like they were installing a projection screen. Outside there was a large Spanish style patio area, open, with lit trees and music playing, a stage/DJ area, and it felt like a great place to bring a large group.   The food was excellent! The food was all super inexpensive for the quality and the portions. My uncle even commented that his $22 Cuban ribeye with the fixings was probably some kind of promotional deal, however he was quickly corrected by one of the employees. They had some great beers on tap, awesome liquor selection, and I sampled a few from the cocktail menu.   Not sure what else you can ask for- great space for a large or small group, free games, great food, great drinks. This is the kind of place I wish there were more of."}
{"text":"This is a really cool location and I'm excited to see this new place grow! The decor is great and I really like the atmosphere. I loved all the games, great music and it was just a super cool vibe. I didn't have any food but I was a big fan of the menu and there were a good number of vegetarian options which was great! I will definitely be trying some on my next visit. We went on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy but I'm hoping it becomes more popular soon! It has lots of great potential!"}
{"text":"I moved close by recently and loved this place my first few times. Great burgers good ambiance. Then their menu recently changed. Not a big deal until I ordered and paid 13 dollars for their arugula salad with chicken. When I spend 13 dollars on a salad I expect it to be a full meal. Instead I got what looks to be a side salad to go.  I feel ripped off and very disappointed. Not sure if I will be spending any more money at this establishment."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for happy hour and found this new place and went on a Thu night. They don't take reservation but they had space for people. The place is pretty lively and very well set. I loved the amazing game areas they have at the front and the back (plus all for free).   The food is average, we loved the coconut shrimp, buffalo cauliflower was a good option too, we wouldn't go with Nachos again. Their tacos are decent and portions of the food are alright.   The cost is average and its a good find to hang out with friends and your co-workers. This place is definitely good for some food and fun."}
{"text":"I just recently had Social Hall as one of my stops for my party bus.  It is a great place to take a large group!  There were all kinds of different bar games like paddle pong, pool, arcade games(FREE) and skeeball. The owner was super nice and very accommodating to my large group of 60 people. Would def go here again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I visited this place while on vacation from Chicago and the happy hour menu is what got my attention. The atmosphere was very welcoming and my server was really nice. They have inside seating and outside seating with a heated fireplace for once it gets cool outside. We ordered nachos, coconut shrimp (it was amazing), corn , and bbq wings. Let's just say we were full. They also had drink specials on their tequila (half off). We went on a Wednesday. Love this place definitely would visit again if I'm in Arizona.  Our bill was no more than $50 before tip. I love the concept wish we had something like this in Chicago !"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm never typically in Tempe, but decided to stop in with some friends for a quick lunch. Everything from the ambiance, to the service and quality of their drinks and food were superb!! I love how big this place is, and the fact that all the games they had there were free made it all the better. I definitely recommend trying one of their burgers-they were amazing! Drinks were made to perfection, and the server was very attentive. I will totally be back to check out this place on a Friday night, because i was told that they have live music in their outdoor courtyard. Not to mention, a huge fire pit and hammocks!! Overall, this hidden gem exceeded the expectations of my friends and I, and we will most definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"The Social Hall was THE place to go and not only be social but to grab some great food and good drinks. My friend and I went during happy hour today and was served by I believe, Michelle, was her name. If not I totally apologize!!! We just had a quick beer and some apps and it was delicious!! She had the jalapeño Mac and cheese and I had the wings, totally get your money's worth and it's just stinkin good. They have such a cool outdoor layout with hammocks, a stage for live music, and a place for games like Jenga and ping pong. But not only that, you go inside and they have stellar booths and around the corner more arcade games!!! My friend and I plan to grab a huge group of us and come celebrate their Grand Opening June 22nd for happy hour specials all day. Can't wait to come back!!!!!    Also a good spot for date night!!!! The ambience is perfect for it. Would like to come at night next time :)"}
{"text":"We had an excellent night out with friends here. Service was 5 Star. Drinks and food were exceptional. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the ambience in this place. They have different games that can keep you occupied. The only thing is there's not much choices of food in the menu. But they also have a bar so have a drink instead! We played pool and it was fun."}
{"text":"First time here...and I really enjoyed myself. Cool spot that's not your typical restaurant bar. Drinks were on point...Food was great and cheap....serving size pretty big for the price. That's a plus. Huge patio and games. It's pretty so you can browse the scene with your cocktail. I'll definitely be back. We ordered the Brussels sprouts they were so good....yeah you read that right Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I have ever had at a restaurant in my life! My friend and I sat down at a table and waited nearly 10 minutes and we were not greeted or given menus. The bartender was busy sitting with what looked like the manager in the corner of the restaurant. They both saw us come in and sit down and did nothing. We helped ourselves to copies of the menus that were on the bar and kept waiting. Finally, the bartender walked over to tell the waitress to come over to take our order. We ordered our food and it came out promptly. The waitress was nowhere to be found at the end of the meal. Absolutely horrendous. Will not be back and don't know why anyone else would be either."}
{"text":"Great vibes at this place. Super cool ambiance in a unique old building. The aesthetic is warm and comfortable, and the patio is a great place to hang. They get 5 stars just for having FREE pool, foosball, Pac-Man, ski-ball etc. My burger was solid and the beer selection is respectable."}
{"text":"Social Hall is the new hangout spot in Tempe. First thing you will notice is plenty of seating options indoors, outdoors, near the pool table, next to the arcade games, hammocks even.  Definitely a fun place to hang with the gang. There's also a TT table they have a nice happy hour on weekdays and a good selection of food and cocktails. Pricing is reasonable and Service was good.  We were a little bummed because the outside section was reserved and we couldn't use the pool table. Everything else was nice. I see myself going back for some pool :)  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was such a cool place to end our dudes weekend in Arizona. The drinks were all delicious, the food was cooked perfectly and reasonably priced and the free games in the back were the crowning touch."}
{"text":"Awesome. Huge outdoor area and a great and expanding indoor area. Staff was extremely friendly. Free games. Like a playground for adults. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Really fun place to bring friends or a date ! They got ping pong , pool, ski ball, & more ! Bartenders are really friendly and serve good local beers from 4peaks & Santan. Will be back !"}
{"text":"The social hall has recently taken over the old minder binders location. It has re vamped nearly everything from the decor to the theme and the whole feel of the bar. It is not a bit more of a classic cocktail bar with a fun game vibe. Down stairs they have lots of free! Games to pool including pool , shuffleboard, darts, skeeball, and table tennis. On top of some video and board games. The drinks them selves sre very good they have a decent assortment of classic cocktails , we went the first night the up stairs bar was open and we like the open feel. They will be doing love music on Fridays and some times Saturday's . we even chatted up the owner mike who was slinging drinks up stairs and he was a very down to earth cool guy who showed real passion for his new bar. I think this place is gonna be one of the new hot spots in Tempe and even though the drinks priced between 8 to 12 dollars might be a bit more ( though better) then some of its competitors in that area of Tempe the free pool and darts alone more then make up for it. This place is also awesome situated for large parties."}
{"text":"I will start with the positive. The building is still unique and has such potential. I love all the games and patio area. Ok now for the nitty gritty. Nathan was our server and I'm not sure what was going on but service was awful. Food was slow and menu is not diverse. I am not a fan of spicy and most of there food was spicy, even the beet goat cheese salad was spicy which was not on the menu. The beet goat cheese salad had 3 quarters of a beet. Very disappointing. I also had the salmon and it was raw. This place of business has the potential to be great. We were in a party of ten. We were all so disappointed. We asked Nathan for a steak knife and 10 mins later we had to flag down a worker walking by to get one with a now cold steak. I was so hopeful but very disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would.  Went on a saturday following a wedding and found the staff to be extremely rude.  The female bartender was fine but the male staff (in particular one barback, I think he was a barback at least) was horrible.  I went following a wedding reception and the barback  made rude comments to the bride multiple timesand pushed passed her while she was standing talking to the other patrons. Additionally, while we were there the kitchen was closed so they told us we had to arrange for food from somewhere else and once it arrived they told us we couldnt have the food there and had to leave--it was very odd and obviously inconvenient.  I wanted to like this place as it is near things I like and on paper checks all the boxes for things I like in a space but it was horrible.  Pros: Decent location, a couple fun games Cons: Poor utilization of space, the shuffleboard table doesnt have sawdust (and the bartenders say they dont have it) so you cant use it, kitchen closes early, staff is one of the worst I've ever had to deal with  I will never return.  Note: I originally posted this with less detail and mentioned I went with a wedding party so Yelp removed my post saying that \"that the person or group who worked directly with the business is in the best position to review the quality of the services they provided\" then did not provide me an avenue to discuss this with their moderators.  This is very suspicious and makes me wonder if them eliminating negative reviews contributes to the the high rating.    I was a paying customer working directly with the business and it is no different then knowing people at the same bar you are in.  I thoroughly reviewed the customer guidelines and found nothing that my experience violates--this is a timely and factual review from one patron regarding the extremely sub par service of a place in which they visited.   Update: As mentioned by the business below we ordered pizza...because they told us we had to get the food brought in from somewhere else since the kitchen was closed. Great that it's a first for them but when you give people instructions and they follow them it shouldn't be all that surprising. And when he says they asked us to eat it outside he means the bartender told us to bring it to the patio only for us to have someone immediately after we moved come up to us and aggressively tell us we had to take it to the parking lot. This is mostly irrelevant since they were being rude prior to the food issue and that was only one aspect of the review that the owner chose to base his entire response on since it provided an avenue for him to try and dismiss negativity. The food issue not considered the staff was horrible and I obviously disagree about his \"courteous staff\" comment. The half baked excuse/rationalization/apology below only reaffirms my initial impressions of this place."}
{"text":"Frankie Fraser, coconut shrimp, and Tequila Mule, that's all you need to know. Had Nathan as a server at the bar, he was just as phenomenal as the food!"}
{"text":"The Social Hall was really nice. We went here on a double date with friends and enjoyed our time. The atmosphere was nice and it had a good vibe.   While there, they had just changed their menu so they did not have all the options at the time. The ones they did have were pretty good though. My only complaint would be that it did not seem really home made. The food was good but a lot of it seemed pre-bought, made up and served.   Overall, the location was nice and a good place to meet up with friends. We visited on a weekday so I don't think it was as poppin as it may be on the weekend. The food was fine but I do wish more of it appeared to be made in house."}
{"text":"I threw my fiancé's birthday dinner here last night and was really let down. The planning of the event was fantastic. I reached out on their site and received a prompt response back from Kristie. Getting a reservation made and a contract on file was seamless. Kristie took care of everything in a matter of a few emails and we were all set. We arrived and were seated almost immediately. As discussed with Kristie, our server was able to separate checks for the entire party. Once we began to order, that's when things started to go awry. One of our friends ordered a Michelob and was told they ran out. He then ordered a Bud Light and was told they ran out too. He then tried to order a craft beer from Flagstaff and once again - \"they ran out.\" It was 6:45pm and there were maybe 15 other patrons dining/casually drinking. It's beyond me how they managed to run out of three beers--especially something as basic as Michelob or Bud Light--while the sun was still out. His fourth try was successful but it definitely shone some light on the main issue I found with this place. We began ordering our food and a few of us were sad to find out they ran out of the artichokes appetizer as well. We also had a lot of trouble getting waters brought out for the table. Once we got past those speed bumps we put in our order and the food came out. I thought the food was really good. Ordered the calamari and shishito peppers and they were both fantastic. My fiancé got the Bugsy Siegel sandwich and said it was great. The parmesan truffle fries that came with it were amazing as well. The next hiccup was when one of our guests received her order of the mahi mahi tacos. When she went to take a bite she found that they had barely any fish or any toppings inside. She sent them back to fix the issue but the manager or someone (not sure who because she never really introduced herself) came back to break the news: she thinks because that was the last of the mahi mahi for the night, they gave her what was left--which was the bottom of the barrel. She asked her if she wanted anything else but our guest was over it already and just nixed dinner. When my fiancé went to the bathroom, I went over to our server to let her know it was his birthday and ask what dessert options they had to bring out. She informed me they didn't have dessert and said it had something to do with the bakery they ordered their desserts from? I made my way back to the table beyond frustrated. When the lady who broke the bad news to our guest with the taco situation came by to apologize again, I had to ask about the dessert situation. She gave me a little bit more insight into it, but it was still very confusing. Something like, whoever is in charge of the ordering and inventory for their restaurant didn't do a good job and thus they had no desserts?? I asked if she had whipped cream and a candle or just anything to offer and sadly they didn't. In my opinion, she should've offered a birthday drink on the house at the very least. I wish I had asked Kristie about the dessert situation when deciding to make the reservation here or that she would've informed me that since we were celebrating a birthday that it would have to be dessert-less, but sadly neither scenario unfolded that way. By this time i was already more than frustrated with how things had been going. It was right around now that most of our guests started to make their ways to the games--only to find issues with several of the games/entertainment: both Mario Karts were turned off, with one not even having a steering wheel attached. There were 2 skee ball lanes but one was broken and didn't keep score. There were 2 dart machines but with only 3 darts to split between them. But hey, the games are all free! Now only if they were fully functioning. Meanwhile at the table, two of our parties were waiting a ridiculous amount of time just to get their cards run and returned to them so they could leave. All in all: good food and good vibes, but these very controllable issues need to be fixed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the space here. It's well decorated, large enough for a big group to hang out. And it's not super LOUD that you can't hear your friends next to you. They have great outdoor space and inside space.   Outdoor space - has hammocks! Also it looks like they have an area for live music. It'll probably be loud on those days, but you can probably hide inside. Outdoors also has giant jenga, ping pong and 3 pool tables   Indoor space - indoor is spacious, dim-lifted, has a bar and lots of space. The games area is all FREE! It has shuffle board, foosball table, skee Ball, mario kart arcade, etc.   The Food - I wish they had more variety, but the menu isn't the best. Some of their food options are overpriced and the portions aren't that great. Truffle fries are bomb and highly recommended! My friend got the pork chop, but he didn't like it that much. It was juicy, but pretty hard to chew. The burgers and fries have great portions! The more expensive items on the menu ($20+) are lacking in portions.  The Drinks - I got a Dark and Stormy and it was delicious. Friend got an Old Fashioned and he said it wasn't anything to write home about.   I'll definitely be back and will prob stick to their small plates menu and just get full of fries and play games."}
{"text":"The renovations they have done to this place are nothing short of amazing. Got to finally check out the upstairs and the vibe is different then downstairs, which I love. The patio is huge, you can tell there are spaces for intimate events out there, yet still be open to the public. The food was more then I expected.. my friend got the pork chop and the Marsala sauce was to die for.. can i get a bowl of that please? I had the Tony Montana (Cuban sandwich), my ex is from Cuba and made the best ones ever.. sorry but The Social Hall's tops his! One more thing, this place has my unicorn.. my favorite vodka, Strawberry Stoli."}
{"text":"Love that this space is finally open! It's a definite work-in-progress, since as of this review [Feb 2018], they've been open ~6 weeks or so. I give the owner props for taking on the task of renovating and updating the former Minder Binder, as massive as it is. It's definitely not reminiscent of the former self. Since I live nearby, I've made sure to keep tabs on the property. I came with a large group of friends for a chill happy hour because of their ads for 1) free games 2) adult capri suns [as big as my head, kid ya not!].   There weren't a lot of games to play, but gotta give them time to fill out the space. Definitely a plus that any/all games are FREE, especially the arcade games! I had fun getting killed in foosball and punishing my arm with Galaga [the trigger is a little slow].   They also have hammock swings! Those + alcohol = mucho fun.   Our service was great. I can't remember the girls who were assigned to us, but they did great with keeping the drinks and water and food a-flowing. I ordered a quesadilla during happy hour and those beloved capri suns for awhile. Can't go wrong with either, except the capri suns were a little too sweet towards the end.   I look forward to their success in helping our neighborhood grow!"}
{"text":"Yup, one of my favorites when visiting Arizona! The remodel of this place is crazy. Looks absolutely amazing with all the exposed beams, can't wait for the upstairs to open next month. Now the food and drinks.  We had:   - Buffalo cauliflower, was amazing! Cooked perfectly with the exterior batter nice and crispy, the interior was soft but still had a little crunch to it. Then tossed in buffalo sauce, ya GTFOH! Highly recommend!   - Green chili Mac, lol! Ya, this was another homerun! Great green chili flavor with the perfect balance of creamy cheesy Mac. Another must.   - Mexican corn, I felt like a little fat kid wanting to lick the ice cream bowl but worried about what mom's going to say. Not your typical elote, but the vinaigrette paired perfectly with the sweet corn and cotija cheese. The only complain on this was I wish there was more! I think my favorite!   - Brussel sprouts w/sweet potato, very decent. I'm use to some of the best Brussel sprouts in Seattle but these were good. Cooked perfectly, all flavor profiles there.   - Paella, note it's not your typical paella. So if you go in thinking this way you'll be dissapointed. It's the chefs take on paella with a Mexican fusion. Heavy chorizo, with huge prawns, muscles and a nice cut of fish. Bold flavors and a good size to share. Definetly give this a try.   Overall between the vibe, service and food this place is up and coming and will be back anytime in Phoenix. I checked out the happy hour menu and talk about deals. Check it out."}
{"text":"We were in town for a show and we wanted to have a good relaxed time the next day. Found this bar on Yelp and were immediately attracted by the \"free games\". This bar... BEST BAR EVER! Lucky Tempe people!!! The bar is so pretty, decorated with a lot of taste and the games... SO COOL AND ALL FREE! We had a blast playing pool and Mario Kart! Go check them out if you're around you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Last night a group of us came here for dinner. It is a really cool place with different areas to play games, lounge, and just eat your meal. The food was good and reasonably priced. We got there a little before 6pm on a Saturday night and it was pretty dead. We stayed a long time and it picked up a little but not what I would have expected. Maybe people don't know about it yet. We will definitely go back...hopefully they pick up more business so they can stay open."}
{"text":"I have never been here an went with a few friends . I really liked it super cool hang out to start the night off ! I got the street tacos they were amazing! A little small for the price but still very yummy . They had skee ball!!! Only suggestion I would make is put more sand on ur shuffle board table as there was like no sand on it . And maybe some more games and more things to do ? It's such a huge space I feel like they are def selling themselves short in regards to not utilizing the space and they have an amazing stage outside I would love to see some live music !!!! We will be back for sure ."}
{"text":"Overall: Definitely a place worth checking out. This place is different than most restaurant. They got games, hammocks, a campfire seating area, n more. Check out their pictures.   Price: price is decent but it isn't a place under $10. It's definitely \"$$\" price range on yelp than \"$\". Only because only the small plates/appetizers are mostly under $10. Other main dishes are higher than $10. But overall great food, fresh qualities.  Food: Great food, but I still think most portions are small/medium Service: Great Service Tip: they don't take reservations unless for private parties.   Price: The have a large \"Small Plates/appetizer\" section all around $10 each. And on the other side of the menu are entrees and other dishes. Price for the food is about a regular restaurant price. Ranging $10-$35. It seems like they change their menu from time to time.   Food: Many of my friends got ribeye or the fish (pescado especial). Their food didn't look like much. They give u the ribeye but the side it comes with it's just fried pieces of onion. Same with the fish, it's just the piece of the fish with a small side. However, I ordered the Paella but it was a two serving portion ($34). I definitely recommend it and it does fill up for two. One of my friend ordered the coconut shrimp and the pescado especi and he was still hungry due since the portion wasn't that much. The paella was probably the only thing I saw so far seems to be a good deal for the price u pay for. The food all taste great overall.   Service: we had a party of 14 people, still great service. The waitress forgot to put in the 21% gratuity for parties over 12 people, but still tipped the amount."}
{"text":"A great transformation of an old school bar/restaurant. I went to Minder Binders during visits in the early 80's from San Diego and was excited when it re-opened. But the re-opening missed in one area, good food. The Social Hall has nailed it in all areas:  Atmosphere - The remodel and opened up and cleaned up the interior. The long bar leaves comfortable seating space and they have hooks. The booths and tables are comfortable and spaced well. Love the classic rock music, nothing like stopping in for a burger & beer and getting a little Freebird. We sat inside but the outside courtyard looks great and I'll go back at night to see what it looks like with the lights on.  Service - Very attentive & nice. Good feedback when asked about different menu items.  Food - They have really stepped up the food here and it is better than any bar in the area. Beer - Very good selection of craft beers on tap and reasonably priced. Coconut Shrimp - Tasted fresh made and was not over cooked. Great flavor in the shrimp/batter plus the dipping sauce was good. Comes with a nice slaw. Social Burger - Good char but cooked to my requested medium rare. Good flavor from the burger meat, the bun was very good but the highlight was the bacon. While it say peppered it isn't overly peppered and they have cooked the bacon perfectly so it lays over the burger. It is almost like they cooked the bacon to order for my burger. I upgraded to the garlic fries for my side and they are worth it. Not overly garlicky and love the shaved parmesan & aioli.  Great feel in the restaurant but the food is the star. There are so many unique items on the menu to try and I can tell from the first visit that the kitchen has their eye on the quality. Looking forward to my next visit. I've given 5 stars because there wasn't anything missed and it exceeded my expectations with great food at a good value."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Get the Borracho nachos. Also if you like arcade games and free skee ball this is a great spot"}
{"text":"First time here. Had a kale caesar salad, while my husband had street tacos.  Delicous food, great staff. Amazing experience, would recommend to anyone. Can't wait to return."}
