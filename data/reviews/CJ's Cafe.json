{"text":"A family owned restaurant with homemade food. Best corned beef and reubens. Classics like grilled cheese and fried bologna, burgers, chicken sandwiches and wraps. Also have breakfast and homemade dinners. They offer specials daily.  Worth giving them a try."}
{"text":"CJs is closed permanently. It was the best restaurant for breakfast and lunch. We are so sorry to find the restaurant is for sale."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a little leary about eating here when we first arrived. The atmosphere leaves little to be desired. It appears if they took a wall down between 2 different restaurants and made 1 mismatched. It is very dingy looking inside with some lights out/missing. But the hostess was very friendly, took us to our booth and brought our drinks right out. They do have daily specials but my husband and I both got the ruben and both our kids ordered pancakes. The service was fast and the food was delicious. The corned beef was very lean with just the right amount of horseradish. My husband had fries on the side and we both agreed they were some of the best we have had. Our kid's pancakes were cooked to look like Mickey Mouse and they got the biggest kick out of that. Not to mention they were fluffy and delicious, definetly not a mix from a box. From listening to the waitress talk it appears to be a family owned restaurant and they have a menu that seems to surpass that of a normal cafe with most of the items being homemade. I would definetly go back. The only thing I did not like was that we were sitting on the side of the restaurant that had the door, and every time the door would open we would get very cold. We ended up eating with our jackets on."}
{"text":"Lots of retirees here...but it's cold!  I wore my jacket.


My buddy got a corned beef sand and licked the plate.  Was huge.  I got the turkey melt, expecting the same portion and it was anemic.  Good but small.

Servers are nice and attentive, drinks are never empty.  Seems family run.  I have lived here 8 years and been here once...just not on my radar.  May return and give another chance,"}
{"text":"It's been a few month since we were back. I really enjoy the new updated menu with some exciting addition to the menu. I was brave and ordered a Po Boy Reuben. It was messy good and delicious. Sandwich composed of thick sour dough bread, kielbasa sausage, sauerkraut, corned beef, coleslaw, fries and cheese. It's grilled. It's a huge delicious sandwich whoever have a big appetite. Service is always good whenever we go in. They have the best corned beef around this neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a strange place.

We first went here after a newspaper review hailed it as a great 24-hour stop. Got there around 8 or 9 and they were closed. Huh. Came back again around the same time and they were closing just as we got to the door; said business was slow. 

We perservered and have been back a few times, but I'm not sure why. They boast about their corned beef; it's not the best I've ever had -- a bit dry. I've tried their fish specials and while they offer several different kinds of breaded fish, they all tasted the same to me.

In the winter, the place is freezing. They run out of things a lot. All those weird things tempt me to take a star away, but my wife kinda likes the place."}
